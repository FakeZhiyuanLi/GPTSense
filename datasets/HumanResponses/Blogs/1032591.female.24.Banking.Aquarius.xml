      Worked today... not too bad, I guess. It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, but then again, now I have so much to look forward to on Monday. Joy. I feel a little better than I did last night when I wrote the last post. Iono... hopefully, I'll just stay in this so-so mood. I'll tell you this, it's a helluva lot better than feeling like you want to shoot yourself dead. HAH. Anyway... I think it's time for either a nap or more Warcraft 3.  =)

      Finally going to get some rest now... I've been feeling really down lately... mostly 'cause it's the holidays, and frankly, the holidays suck when you don't have someone special to share it with. It's been this way for... what... two years now? Iono  *shrug*  I've been taking it out on my friends... my work... It's just really hard to fake it and pretend you're happy when you're really not. Makes me want to just hop in my car, drive away, and never come back. At least then, I can start with a new slate. The rain isn't helping my melancholy mood any, either. Well... gonna go sleep now... maybe tomorrow will be a better day.  *shrug*

      Rain, rain, go away... Come again another day...  *sigh*  I hate rain sometimes... I mean, it can be nice, like when you're just chillin' with someone you're into and just listening to the rain fall on the rooftop... BAH. And dood... Jeff still ain't called yet. WTF yo... I'mma go eat now. What a way to spend a perfectly good Friday night.

      Dum-dee-dum... Well, first off, let me say that taxes hella suck. Robbed me of about three hundred dollars this time around. Goddamn. Secondly, all banks should be closed the Friday and Saturday after Thanksgiving AND it should be opened at least half-day, if not at all, on New Year's Eve. Yup. We're opened until 3:00pm on Christmas Eve, but we gotta work all freaking day on New Year's Eve. That means that I have to get my alkie like hella early or rush to get it that night. Banks suck sometimes. Oh, and thirdly... okay, there is no thirdly. I'm just peeved 'cause of those two things. Work sucks.  Other than that, today was a normal day so far. I woke up around 930am and then got ready for work. Same ol' same ol'. Oh!! By the way, people who call at like 2 in the morning have absolutely NO regard whatsoever for those who are sleeping. It sucks even more when they're aware of the fact that they woke you up, but don't seem to care. I guess that could have been my thirdly...  My friend Jeff is back from Arizona... kinda waiting on his ass to call me to let me know if he's gonna go see a movie with the cookies or not. Hum... and dood... tomorrow, I'm so booked. I've got four people who have asked me to go out with them already and I don't know what to do. Do I squeeze them all in or do I pick one and see if that's fun enough? Aiya... Decisions decisions... Well... time to go play Super Mario Sunshine... or maybe Warcraft 3. Destroying civilizations doesn't seem half-bad right now. MUHAHAHAHA. Aiite, I'm out. Payce.

      Goodness... well, welcome and enjoy your stay here at  emmie-chan.blogspot.com . I found out about this thing from my younger sister, so I figured I'd give it a try.  Well, where should I start? Hmmm... well, first off, for those who don't know me, I'm just another 22-soon-to-be-23-year old (in January) from Southern California. For those of you who  do  know me, then I suppose that information is pretty redundant, huh?  Okay, okay... blog of the moment: my now famous  Sandwich Theory  (which you can also find in my sister's blogspot: mimosaceae.blogspot.com)   Person A  takes a bite of the sandwich ( aka Person B ).  Person A  decides he/she doesn't like it after a while and then leaves the sandwich to ferment in its own decomposing matter. Along comes  Person C , who saves  Person B  from wasting away into nothingness and takes a bite, as well. Well, after a while,  Person C  decides that enough is enough and he/she didn't like sandwiches to begin with. So  Person C  leaves the unfinished sandwich to ferment once more.  Person A , after having some time to think, decides that, hell, the sandwich wasn't that bad to begin with and comes back to finish it off. BAM.  The Sandwich Theory .  Oh, yeah, final words: Never EVER lend money to ANYONE in excess of twenty dollars. It'll come back to bite you on the ass. Believe me.

      Oi... rain SUCKS when you're driving...  Well, I was coming home from San Marcos yesterday when it started raining hella hard! My car started to kinda slide around because I KNOW my tires don't grip very well. Anyway. yeah... and I was sleepy... so driving home wasn't fun at all. All I did today was sleep, eat, shower, and watch Back to the Future... and also redid my desktop wallpaper... It doesn't look TOO shabby, considering I'm not a very creative person nor do I know how to utilize fully Adobe Photoshop (which is all I have installed right now on my computer). All I have on it is a picture of the new Z, my ex's MR2, and a R34 Skyline. *DROOL* Okay, I go now. I think I'm hungry, but I'm not sure... HAHA Aiite, I'm out... PaYcE.  o/`  ... won't you take me by the hand, take me somewhere new. i don't know who you are, but i'm with you...  o/`

      Well... Christmas has come and gone. That's pretty much all I have to say about that. HAH.  Work was slow today. I was short the 30 bucks I was over on Monday. Where the hell did that money go between then and now? Goddamn. Oh, well. There goes my frontline chances. Eh. There's always next quarter. LOL.  I'm listening to Avril right now, thanks to Mimi. Curse her and her music. *yawn* I'm tired, too. Oh, well. I hope tomorrow is slow. I thought I had work at 1:00 but I double-checked my schedule, and apparently, I'm scheduled at 11:00. DOH.  Okay, I'm bored and I'm not in a blogging mood. So, I'mma bizzounce and do something else. PaYcE.  o/`  sorry, girl, but u missed out / well, tough luck, that boy's mine now / we are more than just good friends / this is how the story ends  o/`

      Happy xmas... and all that other crap.  Well, another day of presents has come and gone... and frankly, it just felt like any other day that i had off, except that every IM i got today was "merry xmas" or something like that. HAH... ah, wells... it's all good. I didn't get much this year, but that's okay. I didn't really want much this year, anyway, except for like maybe a new Z in the garage, some money, and my lobster. But, alas, I didn't get what I really wanted. I did, however, get some cute jammies from Travis, a funny Far Side desk calendar from Mimi, and a gift card to Express from Ben. Yes! Express, here I come!  In other news, I met up with this guy who found me on FAP. That was an interesting experience, considering I dragged Mimi and Steve with me and every place was closed on Christmas Eve. HAHA... the kicker was when this white Accord kept driving around and finally pulled into the parking lot. Supposedly, the guys in the car were starting to come out, so the guy I met up with told me to get in the car. I did as I was told... and then hightailed it outta there. LOL. IONO... guys are confusing. I think right now, all I want is someone to have fun with... nothing serious... I mean, if that happens in the future, I'm pretty sure I won't mind, but I'm not looking for anything committed right now. I think it's because I'm still hella cautious and wary, thanks to my experience with David. I've learned that to wear your heart on your sleeve can be rather devastating in the end, if it happens that things don't work out the way that you want. That's not to say I've become a bitter bitch about it, but I'm definitely more... hesitant. Getting hurt like that can do something to a person. Plus, I'm so damn sarcastic anyway, it only added to my dry humor and cynicism. HAH... I want Travis to come back so I can go back to kicking it at his house and watching Quack Pack at like one in the morning. LOL... now THAT'S the way I like to spend my nights... just chillin' in front of the TV and kickin' back with friends. Or maybe sleeping. But I think I've done WAY too much of that as of late. It's good... but then again, it's bad because I'm starting to get used to it. DOH!!  >.  o/`  i still believe ur eyes ~ there is no choice, i belong to ur life because i live to love u someday ~ u'll be my baby and we'll fly away and i'll fly with u...  o/`

      Oi...  Been lagging on bloggin' mah shit lately... LOL.  Well, first off, this rain business has GOT to STOP. Secondly, I need to get some serious sleep. And thirdly, I finally got to see LOTR: Two Towers.  Personally, I think that LOTR1 was better than LOTR2. But that's only because I'm more of a drama person than an action person (if I really had to choose, I'd go with comedy all the way, baby).  Heh... no more driving out to LB for a while. That's only 'cause the person/people I know there is/are going back up north for his/their winter break... or at least Christmas, I believe. All good... I don't mind the drive, but one of these days, I'mma end up sleeping on the couch and waking up with a bad back because of it. HAH... nah... the reason why I don't sleep well at other people's houses (or anywhere else, for that matter) is because I've trained myself to sleep well ONLY in my bed. Yup. I'm weird like that.  Speaking of Christmas...  BAH HUMBUG!!!   Nothing else new though... just gonna take it easy now and chill... STILL trying to decide on what to do with my life and shit... and also what to do with that errant ex-boyfriend of mine. Dilemma upon dilemma. Goddamn...  Oh, and WHERE'S MY LOBSTER?! Aiite, I'm out. PaYcE.  =P  o/`  it's christmas time, again. it's time to be nice to the people you can't stand all year. i'm growing tired of all this christmas cheer...  o/`

      Another rainy rainy day...  Man, I'm tired. I had hella sleep, too... =P  That's probably why... But, yeah, called the ex today to see what's been up with him. Tried to pull a typical girl thing and guilt-trip his ass, but I was too tired, so my attempt was only half-hearted. Apparently, he has a REAL job, thank goodness. I would have laughed at him if he had been stuck with a mall job. Now, don't get me wrong. There is nothing wrong with a mall job, but when you go from making about 18 bucks an hour down to like minimum wage, that's pretty sad. Although, if you're strapped for cash, then I guess I wouldn't say anything, but his unemployment was his own doing. Basically, I think that he came in to work one day, decided that he didn't want to work anymore, and then quit. He didn't think about the consequences of his actions. PFFF. If *I* had quit, I would have had AT LEAST two other options waiting for me. *rolleyes* Some idiots never learn.  I think that's going to be the rant of the moment. Hmm... I wonder if tonight's Smallville episode is going to be a rerun. I hope not. I'm tired of watching reruns. And last week's Friends episode kinda sucked. It was funny in some parts, but it pretty much sucked overall. RATING: 5.5  I need more money in my account... or I need to learn to not spend my money like my brother. Homeboy has an average of like 1200 bucks every month. WTF. I'm lucky if I have 200 bucks at the time I get paid again. DOH. I have to call the dentist back and see if I can even keep my appointment. MAAAAAAN. I hate this whole switching insurance business. One should NOT have to go through this AT ALL. It's such an inconvenience. Curse me and my not going to school.  Okay, time to go shower and clean up. Don't know why... it's not like I'm going anywhere. =P PaYcE.  o/`  look at the skies, tell me, what do you see? just close your eyes and describe it to me...  o/`

      La La La...  Fock. I'm BORED. I'm tired of sitting here and listening to my music... I can now sing one of Faith Hill's songs almost perfectly, inflections and all. Country music ain't that bad, I guess... but only some of it. The other stuff is like crap because it's all so hokey. Returned my stuff today... NO MORE SHOPPING!! DAMMIT!! I can't afford any more clothes... PLUS, I refuse to deal with that mall parking lot BS. My GOD... I drove around for like HOURS today trying to find parking. HAH. Okay, I lied. Maybe like five minutes, but it was worth it. I got hella good parking... like two away from the handicap parking right in front of the mall entrance. WOO HOO.  I went on my job interview today... EH... I think I did okay, considering it wasn't really my best effort. I also went to get my eyes checked and stuff... YAY. I can see again. What else did I do? Eh... Forgot. Oh, and I got paid today. YES! I got me some mula in my empty Coach purse. LOL.  God, I'm so tired right now... My mind is starting to ramble in its thinking. I think I'll end here... maybe even go to sleep early... hehe... I got work at 830 tomorrow morning. My manager had better bring us bagels because I'm not getting my usual Burger King breakfast. If I don't get food, I'mma be one cranky ass bitch tomorrow. Tee hee.  Oh, and I'm going to start ending my blogs with random lines from songs. Pick the right song and you get a special prize. *wink* MUHAHAHA  >=)  o/`  to know that you feel the same as I do is a three-fold utopian dream...  o/`

      Finally got my money...  But of course, I gotta wait still... *sigh* I think my boss is right. There's something about David that makes me forget that I'm pissed off at him. I just think about his unemployed situation and just feel mad sorry for him. *sigh* again. It's not that I'm in love with him... I don't think I am anymore. I mean, I love him, but I'm not *in love* with him, ya know? I'll always want to help him HAH even though he doesn't deserve it one bit. *rolleyes* Oh, well.  I have my job interview tomorrow and I'm kinda nervous about it... haven't had one in over two years, so I'm a lil rusty... which, I suppose is a GOOD thing, right? LOL. Tomorrow isn't going to be a terribly busy day for me... just the interview and then I have to return some stuff at the mall. Then, I'mma go see the eye doctor and get freaking new contacts. These old things that I'm wearing just aren't cutting it anymore. And then I also have to go to the doctor's and pick up some stuff. No, not medication. I'm no pill-popper. =P  I just need some verification of some tests and stuff. Blah blah blah.  I'm listening to my music... haha... it's actually music that my friend had me download and then burn onto a CD. Well, make that TWO CD's. It's all good, though... some of it is stuff I don't have and that I should have downloaded a while ago. Got some country now WOO HOO... I am officially diversified. Well, kinda. I don't have any kind of Christian music or metal... or crap like that. HAH.  And so, I end on this note: o/`  you're a fine piece of real estate and I'm gonna get me some land...  o/`

      Ever get that feeling that any minute now, you're gonna go crazy and have a MAJOR panic attack?  Yeah, that's how I'm feeling right now.  This is getting ridiculous. I need my money and I'm beginning to feel that the only to get my money is to go through darker and more devious routes. I really don't want to do that, but David is giving me no choice whatsoever. Let's just hope he gets his head out of his ass soon and sees the light and that to mess with me isn't that great of an idea.  I think that's it for now. I have a headache again. Maybe I have to go eat... and then take some Advil or something.

      Oi... I have to look at my MBA information still... kinda procrastinating on that. I also have to fill out an application for this job interview I have on Friday at 9am. Aiya! Kinda just tired all around... It's like my heart is tired. Not like physically tired, 'cause I'm pretty sure I'm still healthy, but like emotionally tired. This drama I'm having with my ex is kinda taking it's toll on me.  Nothing much right now, just kinda chilling... Gotta go eat some dinner soon though... I wonder where my dad is.  =P  I have to talk to him about some stuff. Okay, me go now.

      OMFG...  My ex is THIS close to completely pissing me off and making me go postal on his ass. Good lord... what's a girl gotta do to get her money from a bitch-whooped moron? I mean, honestly, most people don't understand why I've gone this long without doing too much about his HUGE debt to me... I mean, I get my payments... and it's not like I put any of my own money toward the card that the debt is on... But enough is enough. I don't like the fact that I have to hunt him down just to get a measly 150-200 bucks. AND I don't like that he's trying to make me work around MY work schedule in order to get my money, whereas HE is currently unemployed. Our conversation today? It went something like this:  Ass:  Yeah, um, I'm pretty busy Fridays. Me:  Why? What do you have to do? Ass:  Um, stuff. Me:  Like what? Ass:  Just stuff I have to do. Me:  It's not like you're working... and you can't find time during the DAY to fit me in? Ass:  Nope.  Uh... I might be wrong, but why is it that he needs to wait until Friday in order to run his errands when ALL he does during his SECOND unemployment stint since I've known him is go out and spend his dumb bitch's money? And it's not like I'm not trying to be unaccommodating. But, I'm sorry... THIS working girl actually has to work during the week. I only get Fridays off usually because it's the easiest day to give me. It's not like I request it all the damn time. If anything, HE should be working with MY schedule. You know, he ALWAYS did this when we were together. It was either his way or the highway. I swear, the more I think about it, the more I want to... well, let's just say that I want to cause him IMMENSE bodily harm. However, that does me no world of good because then I get no money.  Thank God I know a notary that can notarize what he owes me in writing... which means that I'm pretty close to going down that route, as much as I don't really want to. But frankly, the issue of trust between me and my ex went down the crapper the day that he broke up with me and then four months later hooked up with the first bitch that wanted to sleep with him.  Yeah, I know I sound bitter, but it's just frustrating. I mean, if I knew what I know now BACK THEN, shit, I woulda said "buh bye" and left his ass on the curb to rot a long time ago.  Other than that, today was a decent day. Got my tortilla chicken soup from Islands and I also went to Target and got some face cleaning stuff. I hate having combination/oily skin. It's so hard to keep it from getting all gross and stuff... If I could, I'd wash my face every two hours at work just so I can get that clean feeling again... I also have to ask my dad about an e-mail that I was supposed to have gotten from this company I have an interview with on Friday... better do that today. Oh... and look at my MBA program information again. DOH. More school... Oh, well. As long as I become rich and powerful and can crush all those little morons that gave me grief in my life, it'll be worth it.  =)  K, time to finish my soup. Ta ta!

      Wow... More shopping. Well, actually, today, I didn't shop for me. I was trying finish Christmas shopping for everyone. I finished my sister's present... and got my brother his gift. I had a helluva time trying to pick something for my dad, but then finally realized that the man has everything that he needs... so I'm stumped right there. All in all, a slightly productive day.  Was supposed to have lunch with the ex today, but homeboy lagged and decided to wake up late and then go see his PO... *sigh* sometimes, I feel that it's not worth keeping him around in my life. I like his company and would love to keep his friendship, but I just don't feel like he's putting the amount of effort that he should. Yes, I know he has a girlfriend, but shit, you can still try, ya know?  Man... I keep getting like spam IM's from people. I wonder how they're getting my SN. It's getting QUITE annoying. Oh, wells...  Well, gotta go hit the hay now... I'm hella tired... and I'm not sure if I'mma be going out tomorrow night. Heh... We'll see.  =P

      Jesus... Today was one of the BUSIEST muthafuckin' days I've ever worked. Good God... it's like everyone and their freaking MOM decided to go to the bank today. Shit... worked 930-730... and had an hour lunch somewhere inbetween. No other breaks, otherwise. Have I mentioned I hate the holidays? This is one of those reasons. Thank goodness I didn't get the bitchy customers who whined about holds on their accounts. Haha... in the mood that I was in, I would have been like: "Yeah, there's a hold on your account and sorry, I can't release it because you've overdrawn your account one too many times in the past six months." Oi...  But on a brighter note, I get to pick up my Lilo and Stitch DVD tomorrow! Woo hoo!! Trying to see if there's any way possible to spend 50 bucks there in order to get my free 16" plush Stitch. My GOD, Stitch is SO cute!! WAAAAAAAAAI!!!  Hum... I guess that's it. I'mma prolly hit the hay pretty soon... freaking tired and want to sleep away this busy busy BUSY day. Well, maybe. I might also stay up and burn myself a new CD to listen to. I'm sick of the ones that I have in my car.  =P

      OMG... imagine ~ you step into a mall and then proceed to buy over $400 of merchandise... and this isn't even your christmas shopping, either! Yup. You got it. I spent over four bills on junk. LOL. Actually, about half of it was clothes for work, but I'm gonna be returning some of it. And then there's Coach. My God, that store is going to be the end of me. I bought a slimmer wallet to fit in the demi purse, but it didn't fit like I wanted it to, so I'm going to return that too. That thing was like $130 bucks with tax. Aiya... So yeah... I think today was very productive, shopping-wise. But then again, I went with my ex-boyfriend, so it wasn't really all that. I'd forgotten that he's a pain in the ass to take to the mall.  =P  I suppose that I could put something funny once in a while in this blog thing, but not too many funny things happen to me. If stuff happens, it could actually be construed as "drama". Oh, joy. But if I ever come across something funny, then I'll be sure to put it in here.  =)  Aiite. Gotta go get something to eat and then try to play more video games. Hah. The life of a college graduate. Work work work during the week and then straight bummin' it during the weekend. LOL. Life is... okay... for now. Aiite, laters!

      OMG... I am THE most uncoordinated girl in the WORLD!!  Okay, so today, Steve and I went to LA Fitness to work out and to check out this Hip Hop class that they had. OMFG... those moves were like... impossible for me to comprehend. I think I only got the shaking the ass part down. So I hightailed it outta there after like 10 minutes. I was like "fuq shit... I'm outta here". But other than that, I worked out my arms and a little of my back and did my usual cardio. Not too bad, especially since the computers were down at work today thanks to that virus that's floating around out there in la la land.  *SHRUG*  Oh, well. I got my money, so who cares if everyone else didn't?  LOL. Goddamn, I'm so mean sometimes. Oh, FOCK. I was supposed to be nice for a week, huh? Okay, I start again tomorrow kekeke...  And in other news, talked to the ex... He's been exceptionally nicer to me, for some reason... maybe it's because I don't bitch at him as much anymore. I'm tired of doing that... it's always the same ol' same ol'... besides, I guess I can be nice to him from now on. Well, until he pisses me off again  LOL... Oh, goodness... I'm a weirdo. I have to call tomorrow to make an appointment to cut my hair, so yeah... woo hoo. Not too much going on today, except the work thing and the gym thing... I think I'mma head out again tomorrow to work out. WOO HOO... I have semi-motivation right now... *YAWN*  Aiite... well, time for this princess to get her beauty sleep. Adios amigos and all that other crap. PaYcE.  o/`  i'm lying alone, with my head on the phone, thinking of you till it hurts...  o/`

      I think this weekend is one of those weekends where I really could done a lot of my errands and chores and such, but chose not to because the overwhelming desire to fall on my bed and sleep the hours away was far too great.  THINGS I HAVE YET TO DO: *  go to IKEA and find me a chest/drawer that will fit all my bags/purses and yet still serve as a nightstand *  rearrange all my shit when I get above mentioned item because my room is starting to annoy me *  get my hair trimmed again... I think next month is going to be hair dye month *  get a new picture going on the net... my current one is still accurate, but frankly, I'm sick of it *  lose some freaking weight... godDAMN it's hard to lose just a few pounds... maybe I just have to eat less KEKE *  find me a date for Valentine's Day... FOCK... CURSE those people who've reminded me that day is coming up... *  find me a date PERIOD... LOL *  find me a booty call...? MUHAHAHA... nah, I ain't that kinda girl *  sit down and seriously write my troubles away (I write fiction... it's my "anti-drug")  Well... I sit here and I read my brother and sister's blogspots and I'm like WTF... They actually talk about what goes on in their lives. LOL. And here I am, just wasting my time away sitting in front of my computer saying the same ol' shit over and over again. So, aiite... I'll follow their lead and talk about what's going in MY life... or maybe not. I think I'll just use today's blog to vent away, as usual... because as you know what they say: it's better to talk about your problems than to keep them bottled up inside. I'm not sure exactly who "they" are, so *SHRUG* here goes nothing...  RANT #1: Why is it that everyone seems to say that I'm "such a nice person" or that I have such a "great personality"? And then they go on to ask why is it that I don't have a boyfriend. Don't you think that if I knew why I didn't have a boyfriend, that I would go out and do things that would LET me get a boyfriend? Hmmm... I wonder if that made any sense whatsoever. Oh, well... I don't give a rat's ass. Hmmm... Maybe that's the reason why I havent lured someone into my trap yet, huh?  *ROLLEYES*  Perhaps my oh-so-great personality is my downfall. I think that I have the propensity to be the sweetest person on the face of this damn planet, but you know what? That's just too much work. Yes, I can be sweet... and I can be nice... and I can be caring as the next girl, but deep down, I have a realistic point of view about things that happen and usually that means that the sarcastic and biting side of me emerges... and usually stays there for a long ass time. ARRRRGH. I think I'mma try to be nice for the next week and see where that gets me. Yes, a WEEK. I'm human. I need to start small and work my way up.  RANT #2: Where the hell have all my so-called friends gone? It pisses me off that my so-called best friend has decided to cut off all communications to all her old friends once her ass moved outta her house. I mean, c'mon, that's absolutely ridiculous. And then there's the idiot in Arizona. Don't get me wrong... he's a good guy... I THINK I can count on him for almost anything, but lately, he's been getting on my nerves... He seems to think that he knows what's best for me (along with the rest of this goddamn world) and is always telling me things will get better BLAH BLAH BLAH. Bullshit. He's over there. He knows NOTHING of what is happening HERE. And then the Irvine people... my God... how little I see of them now that I don't go to school there anymore. SIGH. My life sucks. Goddamn it.  Looking up, I see that I'm a very angry and moody person. I really ought to change that, I think. Maybe when I get paid and I can get some shopping in... Then maybe I'll be a little lighter in my mood, yeah? Or maybe if I found myself a guy. Yeeeeeeah... That would TOTALLY do it.  As my brother would say: FUQ SHIT. I'mma go do some writing now. Lates.  o/`  kaze ga yoseta kotoba ni... oyoida kokoro... kumo ga hakobu ashita ni... hazunde koe...  o/`

      ARRRRRRRGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!  Fock. I'm so freaking bored. I need a boyfriend or something. Shit... I'm tired of just sitting around doing absolutely NOTHING. Maybe I'll take up bird watching. Yeah... can you imagine it now? Me... nature... and bird poop. No, that's okay. But yeah... I'm definitely sick of waiting around for someone to come around. Where the hell do people meet other people? God, they make it so easy in the movies, ya know? But shoo... in real life, it's a freaking pain in the freaking ass. Or maybe I just don't try hard enough? IONO. I'm sorry I don't have import model looks or the perfect body, but *sniffle*...  Eh, fuck it. I don't give a flying rat's ass what people think of me. I am who I am and nothing's gonna change it. HAH... for all you people out there who's still interested in talking to me, then go right on ahead. But be warned: I'm easily irritated and I don't put up with bullshit, so choose your words wisely.  Thank God Big Bear's only two days away. Which reminds me, I've still gotta pack. I sure ain't hell got time tomorrow. I'mma be working all day and then I'mma be in Irvine for the rest of the night. Woo hoo!! Karaoke, baby!  Aiite, I'm out. PaYcE.  o/`  i never thought i'd die alone...i laughed the loudest, who'd have known... o/`

      *STRETCH*  *YAWN*  *SNORE*  Oi... I wish it was that easy. Oh, wait. It is. HAH.  Hum... well, it's been like a week since I've blogged, but not to worry. Not a damn thing happened in that entire time. I think.   Let's recap, shall we?   Sunday :  I went to my friends' place in Irvine and chilled. Then I went to Newport Beach and chilled. That night, the winds started.  Monday :  I went to work. The winds kept me up for a long time and kept waking me up once I went to sleep. I was very cranky that day at work and I snapped at just about anyone who happened to be unfortunate enough to irritate me that day.  Tuesday :  I went to work, went home, and then... stayed there. Wednesday:  See Tuesday. Well, I worked out first. Then I went home and stayed there.  Thursday :  I went to work, then went shopping, then went home, where I slept for 2 hours. I then woke up and went down to Irvine and kicked it with my friends. DDR is crazy now. How the hell are people supposed to move like that?  Friday :  I went to work, then shopping AGAIN, then went home. After wasting time online for a while, I went down to Irvine and chilled there until 1130pm, at which point left because everyone wanted to go clubbing at The Shark Club. LOL. What a waste of money.  Which brings us to today. And surprise, surprise. Here I am, sitting once again in front of my computer, doing absolutely nothing.  *YAWN*  Fock this. I'm sleeping. Aiite, I'm out. PaYcE.  o/`  come, stop your crying, it will be all right... just take my hand ~ hold it tight, now...  o/`

      Hmm... sitting at home on a Saturday night. BORING!  Man... usually, I got like plans A, B, and C during the weekends because, you know, things fall through all the time. And, dude, like today totally was an example of that. And now look at me. Sitting at home. And there was kinda a plan D and E, but D was still in LA at the time and I didn't know how to kill two hours until he was done, so I drove home. I'm talking to E right now, but it's too late. I already cleaned off all my make-up and I'm in my jammies already. That's not to say that I really can't go out, but it's a lot of work and I'm really tired aaaaand... plan E just called, but shoo... I ain't going out no more. Dammit. I think I'mma watch Ice Age for like the gazillionth time. Hehe... that movie is hella funny... I think I might like it more than Lilo and Stitch. *GASP* Like OMFG!!  Speaking of movies... I want Zoolander on DVD. It's the only movie with Ben Stiller that I actually enjoyed. "Blue Steel" hehehe  Me sleepy now. I think I'm going to get off my computer for a little bit. Okay, bye bye.

      ARGH...  How I HATE it when people call me at like 8 in the morning... Well, I'm not sure if it was or not, but it sure seemed early to me. I don't even remember what my friend told me. All I remember is him telling me "my flight is blah blah blah". 1455? Aiya. I guess I'll check the flight schedule before I leave for the airport today. I also have to stop by my friend's work and give her an iced vanilla latte because I said I would. Me and my big mouth. Oi. And now, I think my cough is coming back. Foooooock man. I thought I had gotten rid of that thing already. Took me long enough, too. Freaking TWO months plus.  I'm tired... so very tired.  Ugh. Gotta go get ready now. Woo hoo. Aiite, lates.  o/`  i watch how the moon sits in the sky on a dark night shining with the light from the sun...  o/`

Can't feel the tips of my fingers. Heh. Thas right, people. I get numb fingers. I don't get hangovers. I don't turn bright red. I just get numb.  Anyway, I feel crappy right now because I'm tired. I'm gonna go now.  Oh, yeah, and happy new year, people... and all that other crap. Lates.

      Can you believe that it's almost March 2003?  Yeah, that's right... MARCH. Dood... where the heck did all the time go? It seems that yet another year is slipping through my fingers as I sit here idle and not doing a damn thing. Or rather, it feels like I'm not doing anything. I mean... I'm 23... still working at the bank  >.  Yep. You heard me. PAH-TOO-TEE. LOL.  Oh, snap... I think I just went deep on y'all. HAH. I don't know what to say, really. I can't blog like long ass blogs. It's not in my nature to dwell on things. Okay, I lied there. I'm the type to analyze anything and everything that I do because for every action, there is a reaction. And with my luck, the reactions are all gonna be hella bad. Oi. But I don't really write down the stuff that REALLY bothers me. Like... emotional, personal shit, ya know? It's just not me to do that. I keep things all bottled up inside and then let it blow when the bottle gets too full. HAHA. Oops. Oh, well.  Aiite, well, enough serious blogging for the day. On to more amusing things.  The cops in Huntington Beach caught a chick who was wanted for customer impersonation that had come to my branch. Had my supervisor told me to stall, I woulda stalled like there was no tomorrow. Unfortunately, she was slow... or rather, I was just being a little clueless and let the chick get away. *shrug* Oh, well. Anyway, yeah, she was caught. HAH. Crime doesn't pay at ALL!  What a hard day's work. At least I get paid Friday. WOO HOO. And I heard from a little birdie that I'mma be getting a raise at my next performance review. Wassup!!  Me outties now.

      *YAWN*  I need sleep. LOTS of sleep.  Valentine's Day SUCKS BALLS big time... but that's just because I'm single. LOL. Me and a friend went to dinner at Olive Garden, which was cool... except for the hour plus wait just to get a table. I was like WTF... but then said eff this... I'll wait. After we ate, we made our way to the Block and watched Daredevil. It was an okay movie. I already knew what was going to happen, so I was just watching the movie to see if it followed the actual comic book closely or not. I would normally say if it did, but I really don't remember too much. LOL. Anyway, time to eat then sleep. Bye bye!

      Man, oh, man.  Today was exceptionally boring. Well, it started out that way at first. I had three hours of sleep, but that's okay... and then I worked from 830-130 (but I got out around 145). When I got home, I realized that there truly is no food left in my house except for a frozen pizza and vegetables. Aiya. Anyway, I rummaged and found some more leftovers and I ate. Then I slept. For three hours. :D Sleep is good! I woke up around 8 or so and went downstairs to watch TV, which was aiite... but then Law and Order: SVU came on. That, my friends, is a good show. I like watching it from time to time (when I'm actually home on a Saturday). It was about 1000 when my sister and her friends came to the house and we were chilling. I was once again amazed at what a small world we live in. Sometimes people from your past reemerge and you're like, "DAMN... it's YOU!!" It was cool, though, and lots of reminiscing was done. LOL. I didn't get drunk, like I wanted... BUT there is a bottle of Smirnoff Green Apple Twist sitting in my kitchen. HAHAHAHA. My alkie for the week. Okay, well, it's getting late... and I'm cold, and my bed looks hella inviting right now. Have a good one.

      Today... was not very productive.  Well, it wasn't as productive as I had wanted it to be.  With my parents gone, I've got the house... and I've got to be responsible.  Of course, I forgot that today was street sweeping day, but luckily, my brother was parked in the street and he left the house at around 545am.  Hmm... I wonder why that foo had to leave so early... even if he *did* have to open the store where he works.  *shrug*  Well, I'll get a story out of him later.  Goodness... I feel like such a mother right now.  Always trying to make sure my brother and sister have food to eat, make sure the house is clean blah blah blah... I was supposed to do laundry, but I think I'll do it either tomorrow or Friday after I get home from work.  It doesn't really matter... I just need to make sure my polo is clean in time for Saturday.  No way I'mma wear that without getting it washed.  Only bad thing is that it's starting to fade.  Damn those dark colors... Well, that and my forgetting to turn the shirt inside out when I toss it into the laundry basket.  I finally washed my car after months of letting dirt layer on it.  OMG... I'd forgotten what clean silver looks like.  LOL... I was getting used to the dirty silver color.  I was going to wash the RAV-4, but I decided to wait until Friday because I got tired after washing my car.  I didn't even vacuum it like I wanted to.  It's getting kinda dirty in there.  GRRR... but at least it's clean.  AND... on a bright note, the new car wash I bought doesn't streak my windows.  :D  Usually, I have to clean them again after I wash the car because of the icky streaks.  But then again, maybe it's because it's winter and the water didn't dry as fast.  *shrug*  Oh, well.  At least my car is clean.  Hmmm... I looked outside and saw clouds.  WTF... is it supposed to rain?  'Cause if it does, I'm taking the RAV-4 to work.  Ain't no way I'mma waste two hours worth of washing and drying and cleaning the car just to get it dirty again.  Even my rims are silver again.  They were getting pretty bad, let me tell you that.  I have to work a full shift for the next two days... let's see if I get cranky or not (I probably will).  Tomorrow, I'm big boss on my side of the branch 'cause my supervisor has the day off.  WOO HOO... BIG BOSS EMMIE-CHAN!!  MUHAHAHA!!!  I think I'mma prolly work out tonight with my sister and Steve 'cause I haven't gone in a week.  AIYA... there goes the routine I had gotten myself into.  Speaking of working out, I think I'mma do some free weights and work out my arms because there isn't anything else to do.  Y'all have a good one.

      Have you ever felt like your life is like this old, old record? I'm talking like the same song plays over and over again and there's no way to stop it because the record player is broken? Yeah, I'm kinda starting to feel like that right now. Don't get me wrong... I'm not depressed or anything. I think I'm just bored. I never thought life would be this boring once school ended. I try to do different things... when I have time for them. I work most of the week. I usually get a day off, which is cool, but hardly enough to do anything I truly want to do. I don't have enough vacation time right now to go somewhere different. Most likely, I'm going to have to wait until the latter part of the year to go do something different, like I did last year when I went to Florida. That was fun, albeit it was freaking HOT. You know how the sun just beats down on you during the summer time here? Well, push it to October and add some humidity and that's Florida. But I had fun, regardless. My friend wants me to go up north in July, but I dunno... I hate going anywhere by myself. Well, we'll see... I'm working on some things right now, so maybe I'll be able to go *somewhere* sooner. I'mma go to the mall soon so I can return my Coach wristlet. Damn thing is too big for my purse. Plus, I don't like putting all my stuff like into the thing. It's cute, but impractical. I'mma prolly buy some more clothes at Express because... I feel like it. I just need new clothes. I also need to start working out. It's hard to motivate yourself once you've stopped. But I'm paying for it still so I'd better go. I'll go tomorrow for sure. I was going to go today, but I was hella tired at 11am. Life is boring. I need some spice to liven things up. I think I'mma go lookin' for spice today. LOL. Aiite then, I'm out. PaYcE.  o/`  no way november will see our good-bye, when it comes to december, it's obvious why no one wants to be alone at christmas-time...  o/`

      It's 12:37am right now and I'm blogging. Aiya... What a weekend. It started off on Thursday night, when I went to go chill with my friends down in Irvine. We went to Chili's to go eat and I had the Margarita Presidente, which was okay... and I have the shaker, too... Which reminds me ~ that thing is still in my car. Anyway, Friday was party night in Irvine... I came home around 1am and slept until 6 something, then had to wake up and go to work. THEN... I came home and chilled for like an hour before taking off for Irvine again because we were all supposed to get ready for this formal thing Saturday night. Oi... What a night. We took off around 12am then went to The Boat in Rowland Heights for a late night meal... didn't get back to Irvine until 2:30am. I washed SOME of the pomade that my friends had used when they styled my hair and then chilled there until 5:30... I came home at 6:00... and slept until 330pm. And now, I can't sleep because I'm waiting for a call... Well, scratch that. I can sleep. Shit... all I have to do is answer the phone when it rings... which is what I believe I will do. Aiite then, I'm out. PaYcE.  o/`  swing swing swing from the tangles of my heart is crushed by a former love...  o/`

      I think that I'm bored with my life again... then, again, when has that ever changed.  That's not to say that I'm unhappy with life... just... kinda reached a plateau as to where I should going.  I work to pay my bills... and I enjoy what I do, surprisingly enough.  I never really considered staying in banking ~ I've always thought that I'd be stuck at some desk job, working 9-5, and then going home at the end of the day.  Well, actually, that's what I do now, except, I don't get a desk to sit at.  Hell, I don't even get to sit at all.  I kinda miss being 18 again.  Life was so simple back then... and I had the potential to really DO something with my life and my future.  I mean, I still do, right now, but it seems that as you get older, it gets harder to change your routine... as they say, it's hard to teach an old dog new tricks.  Aw... but I ain't old... although I'm two years away from being 25, which is a quarter of a century old.  Damn, I'm such a pessimist.  LOL.  I think that I really need to take some time... a vacation perhaps... and really think about my future.  After all, sitting around and bullshitting all day isn't going to get me anywhere, right? Right.  Now, about that vacation... LOL... where, oh, where shall I go... and am I going to be driving?  PaYcE.

      Sometimes, it kinda sucks when you don't make solid plans ahead of time... and it kinda sucks when you say you'll do something when, in fact, you don't want to. That kinda happened this weekend to me. On Friday, I was supposed to go help out my friends @ UCI set up and practice their run-through for the annual VSA Culture Night show. I was all set to do it when my friend in Long Beach called and said there was going to be a get-together around 10 @ his place. At this point, it wasn't too bad, since I figured I'd chill and help out till 1030 or so in Irvine and then take off. Then comes my other friend, who called and asked if I wanted to go out with her and her friend that night. Now, normally, I don't like overlapping things, but this night was an exception. So I thought long and hard and decided to go out with my friend and then go to Long Beach. It turned out to be a good thing.  :)  Then comes Saturday. Final dress rehearsal for the show and I was definitely supposed to help, which is why I took yesterday off to begin with... and suffered through 5 days straight of work, which I'm not really used to. Anyway, I didn't really want to go, since I came home @ 2am that morning and I wanted to sleep. Plus, my dad went to get my tires rotated and everything, so I didn't have a car. Anyway, I called up my friend in Long Beach because he said that he was going to go see the show that night, so I arranged to go with him... thus electing to cancel on my friend, with whom I had sorta told (well, she had decided for me) that I would go to a club. So when she called, I told her I didn't want to go clubbing, but if it had been a bar, I would have totally gone. And she tells me they *are* going to a bar. I was like "CRAP", but I held my ground and said I didn't want to go anymore. I think she's mad at me because I cancelled, but I truly didn't want to go to ANY gay clubs or bars. So I ended up kickin' it in Long Beach because apparently, my friends there didn't want to pay to watch the show (I didn't either) so we ate dinner and rented/bought movies and watched "Drumline" and "About a Boy".  And that, my friends, brings us to today. I'm going to finish watching "Two Can Play that Game" and then shower and then run my errands... maybe do a little shopping. HAHA. Aiite then... PAYCE.

      So, okay... weekly recap of my oh-so-exciting life:  Monday : worked   Tuesday : worked   Wednesday : worked... then saw Matrix: Reloaded @ 10:30pm with my friends   Thursday : DAY OFF ~ went to the bank to deposit money into my account so I could pay my bills, went to Jamba Juice because for some reason I can't live without it now, went to Irvine and kicked at my friends' pad   Friday : worked... went to Yardhouse @ the Spectrum in Irvine with a couple of friends to chill   Saturday : worked, then went bowling @ Irvine Lanes for this Bowlathon thing that my work is putting on, then went home and slept all freaking day   Sunday  (today): haven't done a damn thing yet except manage to give myself a headache by sleeping too much and sitting in front of the computer perusing Internet websites... AIYA!  I think I'mma go get ready now and go get myself some Jamba Juice. I also have to stop by Target and get some more enzymatic (sp? too lazy to go look at the box) cleaning tablets for my contacts... speaking of which... I will not be wearing them today. I am too damn lazy to go poking my eyes today. Maybe I'll stop by Barnes and Nobles and see if they have any new books I would care to read. My copy of THE GODFATHER is getting a little worn around the edges. I think I've read that book about ten times now... and each time, it's just as good as the previous. All right then... I'm out. PaYcE.

      HAHA...  Time for my monthly blog.  =)  Not much new news to say, other than that I've been reminded once more that guys are jerks and complicated.  But then, what else is new, eh?  LOL.  But on a brighter and less serious note, I got my hair dyed yesterday.  =)  It's a mix of mahogany (which has a red base) and black sherry (which has a red-violet base) with red highlights.  Yeah... trying to do a little something different this time around.  I WAS going to put in blonde streaks, too, but I thought that that might be too much for the people at the bank to handle, so I figured bright red will have to do.  LOL.  I wonder how long THIS will last.  Hopefully my Color VIVE will help my color last longer.  X2:  X-Men United was also pretty good.  MUCH better than the first, in my opinion.  Ah, well.  Okay, so, yeah, that's it for this month's blog.  If I happen to find me a boy toy to play with before next month rolls around, you'll be seeing another blog from me.  *wink*wink*  PaYcE.

      Hi hi hi...  This weekend was so... lame. HAHA. I can't stand it when people lag... but then again most of the time it's not their fault. Like yesterday: I was supposed to go see a movie with Travis, but his ass got out all late from work because he had to move a bunch of cars to get this one car that the customer specifically asked for. What a crock. So I take off from my house around 10pm and drive out to Long Beach, which is whatevers. He doesn't really live that far away. So he gets off work and then we go to the movie theater around 1045. Surprisingly, they're still open... Only problem is that the last showings started like 15 minutes prior, so I was like "nah, I don't wanna go see a movie that's already in progress". So we went to Starbucks and I got a caramel frappuccino. Hella good stuff. Unfortunately, it kept me up until way past my bedtime. I got a little tired around 4am, but then my friend called from the east coast, so I talked to him... which was cool. So I went to bed around 7am. AIYA! I woke up around 1pm but I was still tired, so I went back to sleep until 4pm. I woke up and then did jack shit for the next few hours. Then I took a nap around 7pm or so and then woke up around 830. Around 9, I took off for Life Plaza in Rowland Heights to meet up with my friend and his friends. It was nice to get out and chill. So anyway, that was my weekend. What fun.  Oi. So now I'm waiting (sort of) for my friend to call, but who knows. It's like 4am over in New York... and he said was gonna call tonight. But that could mean HIS night, which is later, or MY night, which is now. Aiya. Damn time zones.  On a brighter note, I think I can finagle David to find his Dragons of a Fallen Sun book so I can borrow it. Woot woot. I need to reread that damn thing. I already have Dragons of a Lost Star and Dragons of a Vanished Moon. And I'm waiting for Windwalker to go to paperback so I can buy it. I have the first two books already. Yes, that's right. I like those dungeons and dragons books. In the interim, I believe I'll read The Count of Monte Cristo. Yeah...! Okay, time to go. I need to get some... more rest. Oi.

      Oi... What a HOT HOT HOT day. I was so happy I was inside the entire day in an air-conditioned building. :) Anyway, not much has happened... other than David breaking up with his girlfriend. I have been waiting for this moment for so long... and although I'm reveling in the fact that he is suffering and in pain, much like how I was way back when, I'm also sad for him. I know exactly what he's going through, but ain't nothing I can do to really help except just be there for him if he needs me. That's what friends are for, right? Right. Anyway, yeah, I finally have my closure and can truly move on. I don't feel so bitter anymore, which is a good thing. Too bad it took this long for me to finally be free of that feeling. Now that I think back on it, I suppose I could have just let bygones be bygones, but I think that I relish the sweet feeling of revenge and retribution. An eye for an eye (or more LOL). It doesn't necessarily make me a bad person, but rather, it makes me a difficult person to get along with. I guess I could change, but only time will tell.  I've never liked change.  Karma... I know that one day, this is all gonna come back and bite me on the ass. I just KNOW it. Damn it.  And this damn heat. Man, sometimes I HATE summertime. The heat is almost unbearable. It almost makes me want to sleep nekkid tonight. Almost, but not quite. I've never slept nekkid before. Almost nekkid, yes (like the time I stumbled into my room, DRUNK, and stripped off all my clothes except for... well, you get the picture), but fully nekkid, no. HAHA. What a blog this is turning out to be. Oh, well. Okay, it's time to go to sleep and put in another 9 hours (8 paid plus 1 hour for lunch) at work tomorrow. 930-630. Damn. I HATE closing. ESPECIALLY on a Friday. Aiite then. PaYcE.

      So, okay, today was pretty damn long. I mean, not a lot customers, but dood... stupid cash dispenser was out of balance, so I stayed to help my supervisor try to find the outage. No luck. So I came home around 730pm today, which is LATE for me... Oh, well.  So, yeah, I just basically wanted to say today was a typical ho-hum day.  Although, there WAS an expected little twist. Apparently, my ex-boyfriend's bit-  *AHEM*  I mean... well, no, I meant "bitch"... anyway, apparently, she's still out to cause little... creases in my life. It's irritating, and a tad juvenile, to tell you the truth. Okay, so yeah, so this guy finds her on FAP and IM's her... and the little spore (you can always insert another word that rhymes with this (HINT: starts with a "w")) tells him to IM me on BOTH my sn's. Not just one, folks. BOTH. Rather stupid, if you ask me. And it just shows what a small world this really is. I've talked to this guy before on AO-HeLL... troi oi. Good freaking god. Either I need to get myself some new screennames or I need to stop dilly-dallying around on AOL. LOL. Oh, well.  And, yes, I realize that in name-calling, I have also stooped down to her level. I can't help it. I'm still human dammit.  And I have one last thought: My ex-boyfriend sure has downgraded in girlfriends. Hell, I ain't perfect, but I'm sure as hell MUCH better than her.  Okay, okay. That was the last jab, I promise.  :)  PaYcE.

      CURRENT MOOD:  tired CURRENT SONG:  Linkin Park CURRENT DRINK:  water... is there anything else?  Oi. I'm so tired right now. I think I'm going to go back to sleep. There's nothing I really want to do today, other than maybe go shopping or go have lunch with someone. I just don't know who to call up. Dinner last night was okay. Too bad it lasted in a shorter amount of time than the wait. I didn't feel too well yesterday... I think exhaustion and hunger finally crept up on me and I was feeling really light-headed and woozy, which sucked. I really wanted to see Tomb Raider 2. Oh, well. I guess I'll just see it with Mikey... if I ever get around to calling him up.  :P  Hmmm... what IS there to do right now? I mean, there isn't really anything. I'm not into the beach during the daytime ~ definitely a night time person here. This whole lack of car situation... can be better, I suppose, but it isn't too bad. My parents are really being nice to me and they're letting me take out the Camry, which is cool. I'm trying to not abuse their niceness... so I'm trying to not drive it too often, which kinda sucks. Oh, well.  Last night also marked the start of  People Watch 2003 , which kicked off at Life Plaza in Rowland Heights. LOL. I swear, I didn't think I could sit that long and just watch the people walk by with my sister. I've been hanging out with her a lot more, which is cool, I guess, but I think it'll be good practice so that when we go up to NorCal this weekend, I won't end up killing her. I think her friend, Steve, is coming, too, so that's cool. Steve's a pretty funny guy. LOL. He's coming along to make sure that both sisters return in one piece. My sister and my fights have become more and more violent as of late. I mean, come on... how many people do YOU know would throw a damn IKEA laundry hamper at her sister...? Luckily, she missed. I think. I actually have no idea... I'm still debating on whether or not my little injury back in February was the result of the laundry hamper actually hitting me. Anyway, I guess that's it for now. I will now embark on today's goal of being able to go out. Payce.

      CURRENT MOOD:  tired and restless CURRENT SONG:  Avril Lavigne - I'm with You CURRENT DRINK:  water  *YAWN*  I'm so tired. I wish I had someone to go out with. Dammit. I hate being old. The older you get, the harder it is to make new friends. Not that I really want anymore... IONO. Anyway, work today was okay. The time really flew by. I got my breaks and my lunch and even got another account opened for my brother, which is cool. I wish I could save like that nukka. It sucks money slips through my fingers like... sand? Is that the right word for that phrase? I forget. I'm really not doing much right now, except listening to Avril. I really like this song. I sang it once in karaoke and someone mentioned I sounded like her. But IONO 'bout that. I think I suck at singing, frankly. I mean, I don't think I'mma be breaking any glass any time soon, but I'm not all that.  I wish... I wish... I wish I had a guy. LOL. Oh, to be held close to someone, feeling their heart beating fast just because you're near, knowing that you'd be safe always... *SIGH*  I'm hungry. And I want Starbucks. Or maybe Jamba Juice. Or maybe Thai iced tea. WTF. I want food dammit. Aiite then, me go now. Bye bye.

      CURRENT MOOD:  depressed... and it's not getting any better CURRENT SONG:  some sad shit... CURRENT DRINK:  should be a bottle of alcohol, but just water...  *SIGH*  I am bummed. Not just because I don't have my car anymore, but because I realized that I am SO not happy with my life. I didn't care that I hit the wall... well, I did, but more because of the fact that my car was ruined. I wasn't thankful that I was still alive. I just simply didn't care. And that scares me. Am I so materialistic that I care more about the well-being of an inanimate object (unless turned on and driven by me) than I am about my own welfare? *shrug* I have no idea. That depresses me because I like to think I'm not so typical... I mean, I know I am, but in other ways, I'm not.  And so I am bummed. I don't hate my life yet... and I'm certainly not at the point to ending it, but when it comes down to it, I am not happy. Period. My job... is a job. My friends... are my friends. My family... is my family. I don't have anyone close... I think I keep a lot of people at an arm's length.  I am an isolated island in the middle of the vast ocean, with no other land in sight. That's how I feel.  And on that note, I will bid adieu. Maybe go drink some coke or something. Payce.

      CURRENT MOOD:  hurting and sad... CURRENT SONG:  The All-American Rejects - Swing Swing CURRENT DRINK:  bottled water  *SIGH*  My baby's gone. Well, I'm about 95% sure she's gone. :\  Freaking idiots who brake for no reason.  I'm okay, by the way... just some bruises. Now, I'm trying to convince my dad to let me get the Lexus IS300, but I'm not really getting anywhere with him. I really want the Infiniti G35 Sport Coupe or the Nissan 350Z, but he's not willing to pay for the insurance on a sports car. So... since I'm forced to pick from a 4-door, I'mma shoot for the IS. It's a nice car. If anything, I was trying to go for the BMW 330ci, buuuuuut, yeah, that whole "sports car" factor came up again. Plus, it's more expensive than the Lexus.  *SIGH*

      CURRENT MOOD: bored CURRENT SONG: Sugarcult - Bouncing off the Walls CURRENT DRINK: strawberry sensation  FOCK. I'm bored. I want to go out, but it's too hot. Maybe when it's cooler. I think my friends are going to call me when they're ready to eat dinner. On the up side, my car got washed, although personally, I could have done a better job. I think I've got a dinner/movie date for next weekend, so I'm happy. I guess. IONO. We'll see. The guy lives in LA, but he's willing to pick me up, so YAY. Another chauffeur (sp?) for me.  =)  I think I'm going to go sleep or something because I'm REALLY bored right now. All I do is sleep. *sigh* PaYcE.

      CURRENT MOOD:  content CURRENT SONG:  N/A CURRENT DRINK:  bottled water  So, okay, this weekend isn't turning out to be half bad, I guess. Last night, I went with my friend Christina to eat and then check out the Fox Sports Grill @ Irvine Spectrum. Kinda wack. A lot of people... but they're all white, so we weren't really feeling it. Then tonight, I was going to go to some club out in LA, but the guy changed his mind so we went to go see Pirates of the Caribbean (sp?) instead. It was a long movie, but good. Orlando Bloom is definitely cute... and Johnny Depp was cool, too. My hand is getting better, but even more annoying. It's starting to really scar up and it's leaving gross looking bumps. Well, there are three of them, but yeah. Gross. Not much else to say except that I have major munchies right now, but I can't eat, seeing that it's about 330am right now. I want to go out still, but alas, I'm home and cannot leave the house. Damn it. I want my own place. But then again... the rent would be outrageous and unfortunately, this little princess doesn't have the funds as of yet. *SIGH*

I've been taking a nap every day for the last few days, which is throwing my sleep schedule all out of wack. Oh, well. Sleep is good.  =)  hehe... I was hella tired last night, though, fo sho... I was dozing off in the middle of all the phone calls I had. I think it had to do something with laying down while talking. LOL. As for now, I'm okay, I guess. I could go back to sleep, if I really wanted to. Hopefully, tomorrow I'll get official word as to when I start at the new branch... Other than that, I really have no new news to give out, so I'mma chat online now. Or maybe play Warcraft 3. I bought that damn expansion pack for a reason, right? Right. Aiite then payce.

      CURRENT MOOD:  thoughtful CURRENT SONG:  Jimmy Eat World - Just Watch the Fireworks CURRENT DRINK:  bottled water  Well... this has been the most unproductive weekend up to date. With the exception of leaving my house to go to work, my ass didn't do much else. I was going to go shopping today so I can peruse the new additions @ the Coach store, but it was hot, so I decided to take a nap. Well, I woke up @ 6oopm, which meant I would have about 30 minutes to go shopping (I wasn't even ready to go out into the public yet). Oh, well. There's always tomorrow.  I'm tired. Extremely tired. I just want to sleep away all my troubles. Well, I don't have troubles. I know there was something in my last post where I mentioned that I would do something different, but I don't remember. Anyway, my current mood is: thoughtful. More like... WAS thoughtful NOW blank-because-of-exhaustion.  Time to sleep. Tomorrow is a new day. PaYcE.

      CURRENT MOOD:  content, i think... CURRENT SONG:  daniel bedingfield - if you're not the one CURRENT DRINK:  starbucks caramel frappuccino  I need to sleep. I've got work @ 845am tomorrow, but I really don't feel like it. I think it's because I took a two hour nap earlier today.  :)  I don't think the caffeine from the frappuccino will affect me like it did the last time, so that's always a good thing.  Anyway, I've been thinking about how I've been looking at things lately. I don't know why I am the way I am. I don't know how I became so cynical and sarcastic. I think I used to be a nice girl... a really sweet girl. But that was so long ago, I think I've forgotten how it is to be that girl.  :\  It's a loss, but what can I do? LOL. I always have this horrible outlook on things. I think it's my way of keeping myself from being hurt. A barrier of a sort. I don't know. Anyway, I think I'mma try to have a more positive outlook on things, but the effects will definitely be more long-term than short-term, so don't expect any changes any time soon. This kinda stuff takes time. LOL.  On a bright note, I think I've got the supervisor position over at the South Coast branch, which'll mean more money for me... which means I can finally see paying off my credit card debt in the near future (probably within a year)... which means I can start saving for a new car. But we'll see. I was talking to Jeff about this... and who knows. I might just keep my Mustang until it runs out of domestic steam.  Porsche 911 GT2 here I come. LOL. I wish. That is a $185,000 car... but a girl can dream, right?  Well, time to finish my coffee and then brush my teeth. Maybe call up Brandon... I wonder if he's off work yet... Oh, well. If you'd like, take a look at my website. It's slightly revamped: http://www.geocities.com/swtemmie37. Aiite then I'm out. PaYcE.

      AM... WILT...ING...  Have I mentioned how much summer sucks sometimes? All these people are on their vacations, living it up... and me... idling away at work, helping those people on vacation. Troi oi. Anyway, yeah, I wish it was winter. Gotta love the bundling up and the cold. Well, did my errands. I returned two DVD's, bought another DVD, and bought an expansion pack for one of my brother's games. But he's paying me back on that, so it's all gravy. I was just doing him a favor. Anyway, I got  How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days . It's really cute. Definitely a chick flick. I'm watching  Simply Irresistible  again, so yeah... that's definitely a cute movie. I'm buying a lot of DVD's lately. I think I'mma quit on that. Racked up over 200 bucks on my Discover card, so that's gonna go back in the case. No more spending! Aiya. What else... Oh, well, I had lunch with Jeff at The Boat in Rowland Heights, which was cool. But when I went to go get my strawberry juice drink at Life Plaza, I got the worst service in the world. The guy took my order, then freaking left to give two other customers their checks before even taking my money. I was standing there for a while, got pissed, and left. WTF is up with that. Freaking makes me remember that a lot of... well, people who work in that area are fucking hella rude. Damn FOBs. THEN, I went to Best Buy, and I stood in line for a good 10 minutes before they helped me. Goddamn, there were life FIVE to SEVEN people at any one time behind the damn counter and ONE person who was actually a real customer being helped. The other person was some stupid employee who decided to get his shit before he left work or something. But either way, I was pissed. Luckily, the person who ended up helping me was a kinda cute white guy, so I was nice to him. Otherwise, I think I would have asked to speak to the manager. Yeah... so today was pretty much Give-Emily-Crappy-Customer-Service Day. WTF. Damn, at least I TRY to be nice to those idiots who come into the bank. Fucking karma. It can be a total bitch sometimes.  So that's my rant for the night. Otherwise, pretty uneventful. Hopefully, this weekend will be good. I'm crossing my fingers... well, obviously not right now since I have to type... well, scratch that. I guess I could type with just one hand, but that would be hella stupid and, not to mention, hella slow. "Hella"... That's an interesting word. I always thought it was strictly a NorCal thing, but apparently, it's used up in Seattle, too, where "soda" is "pop". This guy I know said it one time while we were talking and I thought it was hella cute. "Pop". LOL. So cute...  =)  Okay, time to finish my movie or... chat on AOL. I can't believe I still have that thing... freaking sucking up 15 bucks a month. Oh, well. I need something to kill the time with. Aiite then, PaYcE.

I need to find myself a new Wednesday lunch buddy. David's totally out of the question now. He's so freaking moody right now, it's almost unbearable... like a freaking girl. Hn.  I thought I was over him. Apparently, I'm not completely. God dammit. Don't get me wrong. It's not like I get all emotional still. I don't. I just find myself bringing him up whenever I'm reminded of him. Good lord. I need to find someone new and FAST. LOL. That or try harder at keeping my mouth shut and not mentioning his name.  Anyway, time to go get ready and do my errands with Jeff. It's good to have him back home. Now I don't have to drive so much. LOL. PaYcE.

      FOCK.  My tum tum and back hurt. And no more wearing my 3.5 heels. Those things are murdering my feet... not to mention adding to the current slight pain my back is enduring. Anyway, other than my usual aches and pains, 'tis been a decent week thus far. Kinda been outta balance, which doesn't bode well for my intentions of trying to get a higher position. DOH. It sucks when I don't balance... most of the time, it is unlocatable. Is that even a word? *shrug* Anyhow, the remainder of my holiday weekend ended with a bang. LOL. Nah... it was aiite. I went to Best Buy and bought myself a wireless keyboard and  Just Married  on DVD. Turns out I forgot my dad already ordered that DVD for me, so now I have to go return it. Oh, I also bought the expansion set for Warcraft 3. Man... I want to get really good at that good so I can finally kick some ass. Right now, I play girlie style and cheat with godmode. LOL. Oh, well. Then I went to Target and got some more DVD's. I'mma return one of them. As much as I liked  Dumb and Dumber , somehow its appeal was lost somewhere between the store and my house. Oi. I hate having to go return stuff. It makes my buying them like such a waste of time.  Other than that, nothing else is new or... exciting. Well, maybe, but nah. I need some water.  I've also decided that I need to get back to my writing. I have so much to vent and yet I've been stuck with major writer's block. It hella sucks. Maybe I need to meet someone new. Well, DUH that's kinda obvious, but IONO... my supervisor mentioned that I've lost my sense of humor... and it's due to well... I'm not going to go wading through past memories right now. Otherwise, I might want to go drown myself in a bottle of Smirnoff Green Apple Twist. That stuff is good... but definitely not good for me in the long run. Oi. I hate being lonely. It's the worst feeling in the world. It's even worse when I get hit with that feeling in the company of my friends. Ever been in that situation? You know, like you're a desolate island in the midst of the vast ocean... AIYA. What's up with me? I need a drink. Maybe two. Or three. FOCK.  I HATE BEING SINGLE!! That, and the fact that I have a hella gay life. It's so freaking mundane, it's driving me CRAZY!! Work, sleep, work, sleep. CRRRRAAAAAAZZZZZZZZY!!! @&$!! GODDAMN SOMEBODY FREAKING SHOOT ME!!!  Yeah. At least tomorrow is my day off. I guess I'll do the usual and try to get David to squeeze me in his oh-so-busy schedule to have lunch with me. Then I have to stop by work and drop off something... then the post office to mail my jury summons. FOCK FOCK FOCK. I had to go last year... I can't believe I have to go again this year. WTF. The law SUCKS. One should not have to do this shit if they don't want to.  Did I mention I need to meet new people? Yeah, DEFINITELY true. Okay, I'mma go... get some coffee or something. PaYcE.

      *YAWN*  This weekend feels so long right now. LOL. I think it's because I went out last night and did my drinking then. Usually, that's reserved for my Friday or Saturday nights. So yeah. I went to HOB @ Downtown Disney last night for Limelight's Glitz and Glory. It was pretty dead when my friend and I left around 1200 or so. At least we got in free and didn't have to pay 20 bucks a head, so it's all gravy. Then we went to go eat pho afterward. I like pho. A lot. YUM YUM! hehe... Then tonight, I went to go see Legally Blonde 2 with my friend. That was pretty cool. The movie wasn't as endearing as the first one, but I still liked it. I'll probably get the DVD when it comes out, but then again... I'm becoming a DVD freak. AIYA! So that leaves tomorrow and Sunday. I'm not sure what I'mma do yet... all I know is that I've got work @ 830 tomorrow morning and I'm still typing away on the computer, so I think that's where I'mma end this and go on to bed. That is, after my food digests. I hate having late-night munchies. LOL. PaYcE.

      CURRENT MOOD: getting sleepy CURRENT SONG: N/A CURRENT DRINK: wotah, of course  AIYA... So, okay, my computer decides to quit working on me today as I'm trying to chat online and stuff. Turns out it's just my computer that's affected, which really bites. I decided to not worry about it and went shopping... and I came back to find that it still didn't work. WTF. So, I just spent about 3 hours trying to fix my computer, but since I can't, my ex-boyfriend has to come over and fix it tomorrow... but I think he's going to try to weasle his way out of having to do that because he has this notion that my family hates him. I wonder why. LOL. They don't really hate him. If I hated him, then they would, but since I don't, then they don't. They just don't really think much of him either way. So, anyway, I digress. I'm using the computer in my dad's room right now and he's sleeping, so I think I might end this internet session pretty soon so that he can sleep in peace without having to hear the tap-tap-tap sounds of the keyboard as his internet-addicted first-born daughter types away, chatting. My, my. That was certainly a mouthful... err... keyboard-ful. Okie dokie, well, time for me to sleep anyway. I have work at 8am tomorrow. PaYcE.

       o/` ... all day, staring at the ceiling, making friends with shadows on my wall. all night, hearing voices telling me that i should get some sleep because tomorrow might be good for something. hold on, feeling like i'm headed for a breakdown and i don't know why... o/.`   CURRENT MOOD: tired tirED TIRED!! CURRENT SONG: Matchbox Twenty - Unwell CURRENT DRINK: coke and water (yep, TWO!)  I'm tired. It's been a long Monday and it's only the beginning of the week. FUQ SHIT. And I have to park my car outside, which hella sucks. I'm still kinda giddy, though, 'cause of my car. Man... haven't been this excited since I got my Mustang. I'm trying REALLY hard not to push my car too hard, but it's really so tempting to just press the gas and... zoom zoom. :) Okay, time to rest. I'm sleepy... and hungry. Goddamn... my life is such a routine...

      CURRENT MOOD: sleeeeeepy and irritated CURRENT SONG: Ken Oak - These Things CURRENT DRINK: coke   *YAWN*  I'm always tired these days. Kinda starting to get on my nerves that I can't get enough sleep. But then again, seeing that it's almost 1:30am, I suppose that it IS my fault, huh? LOL. Oh, well. I'm going to call up my friend right now... but it looks like he's probably sleeping. LOL. Oh, well. It IS almost 430am over where he is. Damn east coast people. Today was relatively enjoyable. My sister is bummed because we didn't call her out. Frankly, I just plain figured that she got off work at 6:00pm and it would have been too late for her to come out. We were in LA, anyway. Turns out she got off work at 5:00pm and found out from my other cousin that the rest of us were out and about. I dunno. I think my not calling her was partly accidental and partly on purpose. I think I'm still irritated at her... I shouldn't be, but I am. FUQ SHIT.  Oh, to be able to turn back the hands of time...  I really ought to look into making that a possibility. Too bad I'm not a freaking uber-genius. My only talent has to do with balancing checkbooks and making sure everyone speaks properly and grammatically correct. Oh... and also make sure people can spell. Geez, I freaking sound like a teacher. Someone shoot me now. Payce.

      CURRENT MOOD: bleh CURRENT SONG: Simon & Garfunkle - The Sound of Silence CURRENT DRINK: N/A  Well, I have a new car... it's my new silver bullet. LOL. I now drive a 2003 EX-V6 Accord Coupe in Satin Silver. I can't wait until I break her in... then I can go zooming down the freeways of OC once more. I think that's about it. My mood hasn't really changed any after you strip away the illusion of happiness of having my own car again has given me. I'm not sure if that was grammatically correct, but, oh, well.  The Sound of Silence is a haunting song. The voices... the music... imagine yourself walking down a dark street, alone, with nothing but the sound of the leaves rustling on the sidewalk in the wind. The curtains of the houses are drawn, the faint light of candlelight causing shadows to dance as if they had a life of their own. The dim light of the streetlamps barely make a break through the blackness of the moonless night. Not a single soul appears in the street... and you realize that you are truly alone in this cold, empty world.  I'm pretty sure I just ripped that off from a writer somewhere. If you figure out who, let me know, because I know, fer sure, that I don't have that book. LOL. Aiite then, time to get ready for my family gathering thing for my Canadian cousin. Shit. I wish they had something for me. I mean, sure the guy's getting married, but doooood... I never got free food for MY big event thus far ~ graduating from the University of Civics and Integras. That, my friends, is in itself an accomplish that had been far in coming. I'm starting to ramble again because now I'm REALLY sure I don't make any sense. Aiite then, payce.

      CURRENT MOOD: blah CURRENT SONG:  Joe Budden f. Busta Rhymes - Fire CURRENT DRINK: wotah  Have you ever seen the Shinhwa MV for "Wedding March"? It's cute. And part of it is in Chinese. I think Taiwanese. The other part is in Korean. It's an interesting mix of languages. Dong Wan (sp?) is the cutest out of all them. My sister says that she liked him first. I say to that: "Whatever, dude."  Another video that's kinda cool is "Perfect Man". That song is from Shinhwa #5. It has a catchy beat.  On a nice note, one of my new co-workers said I looked thinner. :) It made me smile, even though I don't think it's true. Ah, well. I'm trying to enjoy more working at my new branch, but it's kinda hard. Hopefully, it will get better... otherwise, this is gonna be one hell of a 6-month stint.  I need new scenery. I want to start over somewhere new, where no one knows me... where I can start with a clean slate.  I suppose my life could be worse... but right now, I feel like crap. How lightning quick my moods change.  FUQ SHIT.

      CURRENT MOOD: blah CURRENT SONG: Dashboard Confessional - For You to Notice CURRENT DRINK: water  FREAKING BLAAAAAH.  It's official. I hate my life.  I find that it's becoming much easier to continue to spiral further and further downward into this abyss that is now my pathetic excuse for a life. It's taking so much more nowadays to be happy about something and I don't know if I can find anything to be truly happy about. Family... well, of course I'm happy about them. Friends... well, perhaps if I ever saw them. But other than that, I have nothing. Absolutely nothing.  *SiGH*  I need a drink... a strong one that'll make me forget I'm still alive. I wonder if this is a mild form of depression that I'm going through. *SHRUG* Who knows... and I don't really care.  As my brother would say: FUQ SHIT. I'mma bounce now. Payce.

      CURRENT MOOD: freaking tired and irritated CURRENT SONG:  N/A CURRENT DRINK:  N/A  So, okay, I'm back from San Francisco. Yay! I think. Back to hot weather and work and... hot weather. Happy happy joy joy. Well, overall, I'd rate this trip as a  B- . It was certainly better than any of my other trips up to NorCal, but still not everything that it was cracked up to be. I won't go into details right now... if ever... but all I will say is this: This will be FOR SURE the last trip I EVER take with my sister ANYWHERE. I knew I'd get irritated with her beforehand, but honestly... after coming back, I wish I'd kept my big mouth shut and said that I did not want to go up north. This trip only served to remind me that one of my theories was correct and that I shouldn't have thought that I could have proved it otherwise. So yeah. I'm tired. And I'm hella irritated. PaYcE.

      CURRENT MOOD: content CURRENT SONG:  N/A CURRENT DRINK:  bottled water  Today's topic: bay day-ness  San Francisco is full of people who could honestly go either way. Either they swing the opposite direction or they like to chill with those of their own. Like yesterday, for instance. I was American Eagle down in downtown SF and I passed by these two people: a guy and a girl. It LOOKED like they were together, but the guy talked and looked kinda iffy. IONO. And I've been calling a lot of people, particularly guys, gay lately (i.e. "you're so gay!" when the other person acts like a girl about things like clothes). LOL. I'm not hinting at anyone in particularly, reeeeeeeeaaaaally. *wide-eyed angelic smile* So, yeah. I kinda want to go do more shopping, but I think that I've spent way too much money. Oh, well. A girl can never get too much shopping in. HAHA.   My legs hurt. I did A LOT of walking yesterday. My sister's friend's aunt's place is in this area called North Beach and we walked all the way through Chinatown to Union Square, which was cool. I bought a seal stamp for myself and my brother in Chinatown and clothes down at the mall near Union Square. And then last night, when I slept, I was sitting in the chair, sideways, and slept. My neck hurts somewhat, but that's the price that I'm willing to pay for my vacation up here in San Francisco.  I'm hungry right now and we're waiting for Alan to hurry his slow ass up and get here. Well, I will be back later to blog, so bye bye!

      *YAWN*  Man, I'm tired. I just slept like 11 hours. Yep, that's right. I did not go out last night because *SNIFFLE* I have no friends. Actually, I just wasn't in the mood to go out last night, for some reason. All good. I think I'm heading out tonight with Chris and Lorie. Right now, though, I have to go to Bank of America so I can cash David's check because I forgot to do so after work last night. Fock. Maybe I'm just being lazy. Who knows. Then... I think I'mma go shopping at Brea Mall. Yeah... that sounds like a plan. Well, nothing else is new today, so I will go get ready now. PaYcE.

      CURRENT MOOD: just chillin' CURRENT SONG:  Jason Mraz - You and I Both CURRENT DRINK:  water  Hola people. Hmm... Not much new today. I actually got off work on time (sort of), which is a first. Of course, getting off on time meant that there would be hella traffic on the freeway so my direction-challenged ass decided to take the streets home. PFF. FIRST, I end up heading further north into Costa Mesa, but I didn't realize this until I hit Fairview and I was like, 'WTF?!' So I turned around somewhere and got back... only to find that Sunflower hits Main... which takes me into Santa Ana. I swear to God, I have no sense of direction. Fortunately, I eventually hit Warner... then Red Hill... then Edinger, which I took down to Jamboree. Oi. What a drive. I ended up having to get gas sooner than expected. Damn it. Gas is going up again. WTF.  I have determined that I need to be fed and the caffeine levels in my body need to be constant for me to not be a crabby bitch at work. Also, I need to have a higher patience level and learn that repeating directions a second time isn't such a bad thing. Fock. I kinda annoyed one of my co-workers today, but he deserved it. Dumb ass didn't realize that when someone is telling him how to do something, he ought to remember those words. Geez. Well, that will be for me to work on next week.  What else...? Well, for starters, I am lonely. People always ask me where my friends are at when I'm at home, and all I have to say is 'IONO'. I've realized that I don't let people get very close to me and those that I do, end up leaving... but then, maybe *that's* the reason why I don't have anyone close to me. The last person who I let get close shattered my world into a million pieces. Never again. I couldn't handle it. Despite the belief of many that I'm such a 'strong' person, I'm really not. I think the best way to describe visually how I feel most of the time is this: there is a sequence in FFX where the characters are standing and they are what's in focus, while everything else is backdrop material and speeding by them in a blur. That's how I feel. Time is slipping through my fingers and I don't know quite what to do about it. I know it is in my power to not feel like this, but it's almost like a sense of hopelessness that's got me in its vicious grip and isn't anywhere near to letting me go. Anyway, that's the bummer of a rant that I have for the day.  Maybe I just need a good fcuk. That certainly would let my mind focus on other things. LOL. Aiite then, payce.

      CURRENT MOOD: ... tired ... CURRENT SONG: Chingy - Right Thurr CURRENT DRINK: bottled water  YAWN. Today was a killer, fer sure. I worked from 8-5 today... sat in an hour's worth of traffic, got home and went to straight to bed until someone called and woke me up at 930pm. I was completely disoriented... didn't even know what DAY it was. I was EXHAUSTED. No more late night phone calls. Well... maybe. LOL. Not much new is happening, other than... well, I'm working a lot. Fock.  On another note ~ I think I'm suffering from nostalgia. I saw the ex the other night. Don't get me wrong. It's not like... I'm relapsing. HAH. I couldn't go through that again. It's just sometimes... I really do miss him. Fock. Oh, well, at least I've got a couple dates lined up for the weekend.  Unless I get cancelled on... AGAIN. FUQ SHIT.  Anyway, not much ranting and raving today. Just what I just said. Oh, and Rain at the Palms in Las Vegas is pretty cool (after I had two Red Bull and Vodkas). I think I'm just really too conscious of how I present myself to others when I'm sober. That just sucks. Especially when you finally meet a cute guy at the end of the night, only to have your moment ruined when another guy comes up and puts his hand on your shoulder and asks if you're ready to eat yet (and you're SOOOOO not into that one). FOOOOOOOOCK. So not fair, I tell you. *sniffle* All I know is the guy's from LA. *sigh* Okay, I go now. PaYcE.

      CURRENT MOOD: freaking TIRED CURRENT SONG: Weezer - Island in the Sun CURRENT DRINK: water  Good Lord, I haven't blogged in a while. I've been way too busy with work, I think, which is cool, but dood... I'm hella tired. I've been at my new job for about a month now, and it's not getting any easier, let me tell you. :P I am constantly stressed and tired and... I'm making my money. Woot woot. There isn't much to say other than I heart my Accord.  Oh, and yeah... VEGAS BABY VEGAS!! I'mma be out there this weekend because... I feel like it. I've been going out of town every other weekend now, which is getting a little hard on my wallet, but all good. Okay, time for sleep. G'night!
