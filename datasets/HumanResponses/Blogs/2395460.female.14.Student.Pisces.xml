        I've been waiting for ages to see the full specs on the Pentax OptioMX Dualcam, the compact 3.2 megapixel camera that takes VGA mpeg4 video. Photoscala has the newest  urlLink OptioMX press release , but no word on the weight of the thing, and it looks a lot bigger than I expected. An earlier press release said the Dualcam would be about 3" by 3" but it's hard to tell from the photo. It looks more like a traditional tape camera than the ultra compacts like the  urlLink D-Snap  or the truly teeny  urlLink Philips Key ring camcorder .  Of course, the video quality from a digital camera isn't going to be as good as what you get with a dv camera, but I'm looking for something really small that will do both photos and video reasonably well. Another option is the  urlLink Fisher FVD-C1 , which I wrote about for  urlLink ShinyShiny . The Fisher retails for $800 and the OptioMX will cost just half that. 10x optical zoom on the OptioMX, 5.8x on the Fisher.  I need a good travel camera so I'm going to take a closer look at the Fisher and will do the same with the OptioMX when it arrives sometime in June. And every time I see that Philips "wearable" camcorder, it seems to beckon me, damn it.

        24-year old Maya, a chimp at the Jerusalem Biblical Zoo gave birth to twins two days ago. The zookeepers were shocked as the only adult males in the zoo have been sterilized. The culprit? Seven-year old Nicky, aka Chimp Ashton, who unlike most human males, has hit puberty a bit early. Poor Maya shouldn't count on too much help from dad, though, because it appears that eight other female chimps at the zoo are awaiting their own bundles of joy.   So Nicky is a bit of a runaround, maybe more  urlLink Marc Anthony  than Ashton, but those  urlLink chimp babies  sure are cute.  Read more  urlLink here .

         urlLink Boing Boing  just reported that  urlLink Doug Rushkoff's  new graphic novel,  urlLink Club Zero-G  is now available at  urlLink Amazon .    The story follows Zeke, a gangly, unpopular, 19-year-old college student - a townie who also happens to attend the elite college in his community - who has discovered a terrific new club where he is accepted and popular. There's only one catch: everyone at the club is dreaming. It only exists in the shared dream consciousness of its participants. If at all .   Doug's a genius. And a great guy who talks faster than maybe anyone I've ever met. He was one of my favorite teachers at  urlLink ITP . I highly recommend watching his Frontline documentary on marketing pop culture to kids,  urlLink The Merchants of Cool .

          urlLink Recycling for Charity  has just made it even easier to donate your old cell phones, PDAs, digital cameras, and pagers so you can help ease the stress on the environment. RFC is now providing pre-paid shipping labels online so it costs you nothing to donate your old gadgets to be refurbished and then redistributed.   RFC says that by 2006, 85,000 tons of cell phones will be trashed. That's about 180 million cell phones, all full of potentially toxic metals. Don't add yours to the landfill pile. To print your own shipping labels, donate to the cause, or just find out more about RFC, please visit  urlLink Recyling for Charity .

        The  urlLink Ambient Orb  now has a cousin, the  urlLink Ambient Beacon Weather Forecasting Station . The original orb changes colors to reflect changes in any information available on the wireless Ambient Network. Presently you can track stock prices, pollen counts, news "probability", or someone's presence on Instant Messenger. The Ambient Beacon is a dedicated weather crystal ball, connected to the National Weather Service. The information is updated to the Beacon every fifteen minutes and in case of weather emergencies such as snow, the device will flash.   Okay...this thing looks kind of cool, but I'm trying to figure out how it's really useful. Not only are weather reports blaring from the radio and tv and Internet, but from most of my wireless apps like Vindigo too. I am inundated with "accuweather" reports all day long. You almost can't go 15 minutes without hearing a weather update. Uh oh, 13 minutes until the next update, surely I can't open the door and step outside.   The Ambient Network is expanding, and may eventually turn the Orb into more than a mod lava lamp.

         Alright, it's definitely a trend, this idea of incorporating real exercise into gaming. Now you can get fit while you play even if you can't afford the $1200 Power Grid joystick. If you've been in an arcade in the last two years or seen  Lost In Translation , you've seen those dancing fools going crazy trying to keep the beat with on screen dance-off opponents.  Maybe it looks silly if you're as arrhythmic as I am, but it turns out, people who are addicted to  urlLink Dance Dance Revolution   are getting a serious workout. It makes sense, since the game gets faster and more intricate as you get better.   Check out some of the personal stories of people who've slimmed down on  urlLink GETUPMOVE . Matt Keene says he's   urlLink lost 150 lbs.  playing DDR.   DDR is available for XBOX and PS2 for about $40 and the dance pads (also about $40) and other accessories are available at  urlLink DDRFreak . The newest version of the game,  urlLink DanceDanceRevolution Ultra Mix2 , will be available later this year from Konami Arts.  Read more  urlLink here  .

      In the world of tech, I have reluctantly accepted my role as the person who comes into the conversation long after it's begun (though not after it's completely over and the others have already moved on to another topic), just as I've accepted my role as the mother who sits in the balcony at the 9:30 Club rather than down below with the cool, young people.  Of course, it's a matter of perspective.  In the context of my very traditional profession (law), where people are a little slow to embrace new technology (I still know lawyers who use dictaphones and expect their secretaries to take dictation), I can pose as someone who's right there on the blinding edge of innovation.  For instance, I can still impress many of my colleagues with my Treo 600, my usb jump drive the size of a lipstick, and my lime green iPod mini, all of which I'll write about here as if they weren't yesterday's news.  If we're going to talk about tech to non-geeks, there's a benefit to having someone on board who can test gadgets in a real-life setting, and report on whether they're truly idiot-proof.  When a techie shows me a cool gadget and dismisses my concerns about how to use it with a casual, "It's easy," I take that with a huge grain of salt.  While I may not be the Amelia Bedelia of consumer technology (there's someone else we have in mind for that role), I'm probably fairly typical among female, non-tech professionals.  We're eager and ready to learn about fun technology, and have the money to buy it (in fact, we do buy it in greater numbers than men do), but manufacturers and retailers aren't knocking on our doors looking for our business.

      I don't particularly remember the days when you got the gang together and sat around a table or on the floor with six hundred maps and papers and dice all over the place. In fact, I can't remember what came first in my RPG (role playing game)life:  urlLink Baldur's Gate  or old fashioned gatherings. The point is, role playing is now easier and in my opinion more fun on a computer with great effects and multi-player and no dice rolling, although sometimes you still have to go old school just for the hell of it.   My favorite computer game RPG so far is most definitely  urlLink Neverwinter Nights . With two expansion packs out, you can be a player or a dungeon master, or create your own worlds with creatures and stories. Each expansion pack adds a little bit more onto the original story and then adds it's own epic adventure, as well as more creatures and settings. I am just absolutely in love with this game, and you don't need to be an RPG pro to play it. You can join groups online at the website to form a new kind of guild to play with other people. With versions for both PC and Mac, Neverwinter Nights is becoming quite popular and unites both the old time players and the new ones.

        I've been reading reviews of the new books,  urlLink Be More Chill  and  urlLink Adventures of the Artificial Woman  and based on the buzz, both are going to take off, way beyond the sci-fi crowd.     urlLink Ned Vezzini , the 23-year old writer of "Be More Chill" is getting some good reviews but I don't know how much I can like a guy whose first book was an autobiography, published at the ripe old age of 17. Come  on . Anyway, "Chill" is about a dorky high school guy who becomes cool by swallowing a "squip", a pill-sized "super-computer". The computer tells him how to dress, what to say, you know, how to  be more chill . Yeah, I'm a little dubious but Amazon says it's "searingly witty" and "suprisingly poignant". All of Vezzini's  urlLink Squip Central  cluster of websites are obvious PR fabrication (yeah I know, I thought the butt skirts were real...) but I think the news byte about the Weitz Brothers (American Pie, About a Boy) signing on to make the film version is true. Looks like there are already some  urlLink Vezzini haters  and I guess I should actually read the book before I join in.  Thomas Berger's "Adventures of the Artificial Woman" looks much more promising. It's a Pygmalion tale of an animatronics technician who decides to build his dream wife. He's so successful in making her the ultimate woman that she leaves him to become a movie star, then seeks the Presidency. Sounds as dark and surreal as Berger's "The Houseguest", which I mostly enjoyed. I see this becoming a movie starring Apple Martin's mummy.

        Japan gets the coolest gadgets first, and now this. Look closely, though, it's not what you think. That woman is not pulling the backside version of an  urlLink Alexandra Kerry peek-a-boo ; her skirt is just painted to look like she is. It's so unglamorously realistic, complete with wedgie and grandma cotton.   My friend MB has put together more pictures, complete with  urlLink see-thru panty rantings.    Update: Jacki has let me know that this is apparently a hoax, already debunked by  urlLink Snopes . The alignment of the underwear is far too perfect for it to be real unless each of these shots was meticulously planned and posed.

      I was just reading in Variety that the new incarnation of  urlLink TechTV , now owned by Comcast and merged with  urlLink G4 TV , is going to be decidedly male-oriented. Here's the word from Charles Hirschhorn, the G4 CEO who will now head up the merged company:    Net's target audience of 12- to 34-year-old males, he said, is its best selling point to cable operators, who regard these viewers as the most receptive to buying digital services such as video-on-demand, high-speed access to the Internet and interactive videogames .   I have a bad feeling about this. I don't get G4 presently, but anyone who gets TechTV should be noticing the gradual changover to G4. G4 today has features on  urlLink booth babes  and a show about a  urlLink redneck supermodel.  Sounds enlightening.

        I've been looking for a decent laptop bag for ages, and I'm still using the now-handleless freebie Dell gave me when I bought a high-end laptop (133 MHz, 24mb of RAM, and still ticking) back in 1996.  As with most things, there seems to be a form or function issue. If you want good padding and plenty of space for files, CDs, and all your other junk, you're stuck with an ugly Targus bag that looks like a cheap suitcase from 1965. There are nicer-looking bags, but rarely with enough pockets and protective cushioning.   I think I found the perfect combination in the  urlLink Casauri New Portfolio . It's made of water resistant nylon, has tons of pockets outside and inside, comes with a detachable shoulder strap, and comes in all sorts of lovely colors like kiwi and navy. It's decently priced too, at $106.00.   urlLink Acme Made Laptop Bags  are pretty cute too, but they look rather flimsy and have one measly rear pocket on the outside. As cute as the pink polka dots are, the lack of space for even a power adapter is kind of a deal breaker.

         Although some people might claim that nothing is as good as an ipod and that the iriver is just a poser, I happen to like the iriver a lot more than the ipod. The iriver H120 can hold up to 600 hours of music and has a 16 hour battery life. It even has an FM tuner and a voice recorder. At first it's a bit hard to figure out if you're at all like me and instruction manuals don't seem to explain how to work the object you've got but instead some CIA cryptology system, but once you get used to it, it's as simple as...... something very simple.   Very useful for switching quickly from Britney Spears to AFI when a cute guy happens to appear around the bend to see what you're listening to......

      A German company has sold 1.6 million "WC Ghosts".  WC is a toilet and the "ghost" is a female voice which, upon being triggered at the lift of the toilet seat, will say, "Hello, what are you up to then? Put the seat back down right away, you are definitely not to pee standing up ... you will make a right mess..."   If you can housebreak a dog...  More on the  urlLink Talking Toilet.

          I just read the early beta issue of Ziff Davis Media’s new lifestyle magazine, Sync, which will launch this summer. On first glance, it looks just like  urlLink Cargo , the male  urlLink Lucky . I was initially encouraged by the fact that there was no gadget girlie on the cover, but judging from the  urlLink  Sync Blog   entry about models wandering the halls, I'm sure it's only a matter of time. Somehow I doubt there will be any shots of dudes in Calvin Klein undies draped supine over plasma tvs.  It's all pretty standard stuff, features on tech toys that are usually marketed to males: cars, Playstations, and remote controls. Ziff Davis promises that Sync will be showing readers  urlLink how to use these products   , but nothing in the sample issue reflects their cover motto of "It's not about the stuff, it's about what you do with it."  Wait, unless the article about how to use camera phones in new ways wasn't a joke. "Carry Lots of Photos", "Take photos in a bar", "Take photos in a gym", "Get Naughty Pictures Sent To You". Wow, who knew?   What’s interesting is that women buy more electronics than men do. Even when the items are for men or for the whole family, it’s usually the woman who decides what to buy. Why then are magazines like Sync and Cargo, which are pretty much just about electronics shopping, targeting only men? The oft-quoted  urlLink  CES Study   about women accounting for $55 billion of the $96 billion spent on technology products last year doesn’t seem to be registering in the publishing world as of yet. I guess the technosexual guy will have to hope that his mother and his girlfriend won’t ignore the dog-eared pages from Sync that are in his Christmas list.

         Soon you won't have your addiction to your Playstation to blame for your flabby body. Powergrid Fitness is coming out with the Kilowatt Game Controller late this spring, and it aims to turn your body into a fit, toned joystick.    Sensors in the ski machine-like device measure the force of your movements which are translated into game actions.  You won't even have to move too much, as this is isometric exercise which means you exert your muscles without using your joints. Yeah I don't know what that means either, maybe it's kind of like Pilates. PowerGrid assures that you will feel the burn, however, and the demo users in  urlLink Powergrid's funny infomercial-style plugs  appear to be sweating from their efforts while not discernibly doing anything at all.    The Kilowatt will be compatible with Playstation2, Xbox, and Nintendo Gamecube. Water and towels not included.  Just one question- is the world ready for gamers with muscles? If this takes off, be prepared for global "Revenge of the Nerds".    Pre-orders are now being accepted now at  urlLink  Powergrid Fitness.

      Just read on Yahoo, via AP, a story about a  urlLink weird diet gadget  that's coming out on Wednesday. It apparently forces you to take teeny tiny, Scarlet O'Hara bites so that you can lose weight. It's just some sort of mouth gear that makes it impossible to shove huge forkfuls of food into your mouth. You could also, of course, simply do that on your own without putting a giant retainer in your mouth. I'm sure it makes you look really attractive too.

        It looks like  urlLink Chinoiserie  is going to be the big style trend for Fall 2004. It makes me think of the exquisite burgundy silk cheongsam that  urlLink Kirsten Dunst  wore in the first  Spiderman . Kirsten looked lovely but if I put on a cheongsam I'd look like I just clocked out of my shift as a hostess at the  Golden Dragon . I might have to stick with one of these silk cell phone bags. They're the perfect size for just the absolute essentials: cell phone, credit card, and a lipstick. Just a few bucks each, so you can buy one in every color.  Available at  urlLink Pearl River  (although their online store is currently sold out.)  Also at  urlLink Teenage Dope Slave , a cool shop full of vintage clothing and accessories, not an online opium den.

        I've resisted  urlLink XM Radio , as much as I enjoy it in my friends' cars, because I've been waiting for something like the  urlLink Cambridge SoundWorks Playdock . The Playdock works with the excellent  urlLink Delphi XM Roady Radio , essentially as a docking station that turns the Roady into a beach-ready boombox. You can use the Roady in your car, and then pop it out and use it anywhere inside the Playdock.   The XM Roady is a complete set for the car (receiver, antenna, cassette adapter) for about $120 and the PlayDock, which will be available later this summer will set you back about an additional $200. The XM Radio service is $9.99 a month.  Read the  urlLink Playdock Press Release .  Read about the possibility of PDA-powered XM Radio at   urlLink Engadget .

        I know hand washing is the standard activity for many obsessive-compulsives and I like clean hands as much as anyone, but nothing soothes my neurotic spirit like brushing my teeth. It's actually been a little bit of a problem for me because I carry a toothbrush, brush vigorously in some mirrorless little public bathroom and end up with toothpaste foam stains on my shirt for the rest of the day.  urlLink Oral-B  had people like me in mind. The new  urlLink Brush Up  disposable toothbrushes are textured teeth wipes that fit over your finger like a giant paper thimble. It's coated with a non-foaming mint-flavored cleanser that freshens like mouthwash. They've been making these for dogs for years but always in bacon or chicken flavor.   I do like those teeth-cleaning gums like  urlLink Orbit , but if chewing a piece really gives you a "just-brushed clean feeling", then I don't want to look into the mouths of those people working at Wrigley. Brushing your teeth 12-13 times a day is time-consuming, sure, but I've never had a cavity. I kid, it's really more like 6 times a day, perfectly normal, maybe just on the high side of normal, don't you think?  Well anyway, these Brush Ups really do curb my urge to run to my  urlLink Oral-B 7000 Power Brush . The paper is tough enough not to fall apart in your mouth, but still gentle on your gums, and the textured little nubs really scrub away the fuzzy plaque that starts to build up  seconds  after your last brushing. The only problem I see with these is that they are about $3 for a package of 12 individually wrapped little wipes. That's like a day's supply. Where's the economy sized box?

        Michael Moore and  urlLink MoveOn PAC  have organized a nationwide online town meeting for tonight, Monday, June 28th, to discuss how everyone can be more involved during this important election year. If you've got the physical space, a broadband internet connection, and good speakers, you can host your own Town Meeting by submitting your info  urlLink here . You can also search for the party nearest to you  urlLink here . The meeting will start around 8:15 pm EST. If you haven't yet seen Fahrenheit 9/11, skip lunch so you can leave early to catch a  urlLink matinee . You'll definitely be in the mood for a debate after seeing this.  With the box-office success of Moore's film, we might soon be seeing an American release of the more traditionally journalistic documentary about GW,   urlLink  Le Monde selon Bush   (The World According to Bush), which aired on French television earlier this month.

Soon even coffee snobs may be able to drink a good cup of decaf because Brazilian scientists have discovered a naturally caffeine-free coffea arabica plant in Ethiopia.

        I was bummed to find that I had missed the  urlLink Wedding Cake Fondant Workshop  at  urlLink Sur La Table  (seriously), but I don't think I need it anymore.  urlLink Kopycake  has started a cake decorating revolution. No longer will you be forced to buy your  urlLink bachelor party novelty cakes  at expensive bakeries. All you need now are some dirty pictures and you can make your own, much more realistic penis or breast cakes.   All you do is pop in the  urlLink Edible Frosting Sheets  into your printer, which should be loaded with  urlLink Kopykake Edible Ink  and then the resulting print is placed atop a freshly frosted cake. The image will meld seamlessly into the frosting. The film is FDA-approved and Kosher, and hopefully tastes better than those sugar roses on birthday cakes.    I can't tell you how excited I am about this. All my friends and family should expect very personalized cakes for their birthdays.   The inks only work in Canon printers so I guess I'll be getting a new inkjet. Come on HP, please show your support for this very important innovation.  Get inspiration from the  urlLink Kopykake Gallery .

         I would never buy a gadget just because it's cute (although if it's really really tiny, I don't know...) and I have zero interest in the  urlLink Hello Kitty Laptop , but I find myself wanting these  urlLink San-x cell phone overlays .  As  urlLink San-x  (translated through babelfish) says, "your carrying is changed cutely!" The overlays are translucent, so you can still see your phone's lcd, even if it's tinted in rainbow  urlLink Afro-Ken . They remove cleanly so you can cycle through all the San-x characters. San-x aims for a slightly older audience than Sanrio's, so I'm pretty sure I won't look at all silly when I take out my  urlLink Momobuta  phone.  San-x doesn't appear to take international orders but if you're lucky enough to live near a   urlLink Kinokuniya , their stationery departments carry a huge stock of Sanrio and San-x products. I'm going to start hunting in the Edgewater, NJ location this weekend.

         urlLink Jim Louderbeck , of  urlLink Extremetech , was decidedly unimpressed by those  urlLink solar plants  I wrote about a couple of months ago. I think even Jim will be tempted by the  urlLink Mathmos Space Projector , which projects shapes and colors from individual gels onto walls like a ginormous kaleidoscope. And the images look disturbingly like freakishly mutated red blood cells!    Hmmm, maybe he'd like  urlLink Aduki Lamps  better. After being charged, you disconnect the cord and the lamps will slowly fade through a spectrum of four colors over a course of five hours.     How much fun would Jim have playing with these   urlLink Flip and Faze Lights ? Flip over the light in any direction and it will fade through a series of nine colors. Non-toxic to boot!  Jim and anyone else can order the Mathmos lamps at   urlLink ZIPPERgifts .

       urlLink    The Washington Post Magazine’s cover photo for   urlLink The Little Engine That Might   shows what appears to be a giant riding in an odd-looking three-wheeled minivan.  Living in a country where even our compact cars are huge, my sense of man-to-vehicle proportion wouldn’t allow my brain to accept the notion that the human being behind the wheel is of ordinary size and that it’s the car that’s unusually small.  I’ve been looking at that cover for three days, and my eyes still won’t adjust to the reality.  This optical illusion houses an electric engine so efficient that it could revolutionize the auto industry by drastically reducing our dependence on gasoline.  It’s been nine years in the making, but  urlLink New Generation Motors  is struggling to attract investors and to survive long enough to make an impact in Detroit.  When I think about some of the cockamamie ideas that were eagerly funded by wide-eyed venture capitalists just a few years ago (remember boo.com and pets.com and wwwrrr.com?), it’s hard to believe that this real live innovation has to look to India for opportunity.  Why India?  “There is no ingrained culture, no tradition of unlimited personal mobility.”  The Post’s story is a sobering look at the political and industry forces that discourage the development of environment-friendly alternatives.    To see these motors in operation here in the states, we’d have to attend one of the solar car races that university engineering departments participate in every year (this is how New Generation got its start).  To ride in an actual passenger vehicle running on one of these engines, we’d have to make our way to India for a ride on the three-wheeled autorickshaw shown in this photo.

        I think makeovers are played out. Reality television has made over  urlLink living rooms ,  urlLink old cars ,  urlLink women with pathologically low self-esteem , what's left? Mongrel dogs who long for poodle trims?   I think the next big thing is   trash  . Of course, Ebay taught us years ago that one person's trash is another person's treasure but now recycling has become an actual art form.  urlLink  Star Trash  , an exhibit in New York City by French photojournalists Pascal Rostain and Bruno Mouron, featured  urlLink Larry King's diapers , Arnold Schwarzenegger's Cuban cigar wrappers, and Lactaid from the Banderas-Griffith household.    urlLink  Mongo: Adventures In Trash  , by Ted Botha, profiles all kinds of mongo seekers from the homeless searching for  food to book lovers hunting for rare first editions. Botha himself furnished his own apartment with things he found discarded on Manhattan streets.  James Scurlock's short documentary film,  urlLink  Parents of the Year  , which just screened at  urlLink AFI Silverdocs , chronicles the lives of Rogelio and Yolanda Garcia, a Mexican immigrant couple living in California, who put their children through college by foraging through dumpsters.  Parents of the Year  will be airing on HBO later this summer.  All of this says a lot about our culture of rampant and easily disposable consumerism (of which I am a huge participant and inciter) and I hope will lead to more than just lurid reality shows, but do be careful about what you throw away because Rostain and Mouron are going after the "regular people" next.

        Well, sort of.  urlLink Isolagen  will actually grow the collagen for you, but it will be made from your own cells, from a patch of skin taken from behind your ear. After six weeks, the newborn collagen will be sent to your doctor who can inject it into wrinkles, scars, and lips. Because Isolagen is made from your own cells, it should be better tolerated than  urlLink bovine collagen .  How much collagen can they make from one skin sample? Isolagen says they hope that clinical trials will show that the sample can be stored and used again and again. I hope so. While some cows may be praying for Isolagen to save their hides, I worry about Melanie Griffith's poor ears.  Watch  urlLink the conception of Isolagen .

        Remember the scene in  Blade Runner , when the replicant  urlLink Zhora , played by Joanna Cassidy, sheds her snakes and heads for the shower? I always wondered why no one actually made a shower like that, with a blow-dryer built right in, so like Zhora, you could just go right from the shower to being a badass killer without stopping to towel off and use your Conair.    urlLink Jacuzzi  has finally made it a reality. The  urlLink Summer Rain shower systems  come with the option to add "The Ambient Air Body Dry System". 12 air jets blast out warm air up to 150 degrees farenheit, and dry you completely before you even step out of the shower. Replicants probably don't even feel the cold, but for us, that first step out of the hot steam would be a lot more pleasant after a head-to-toe blow dry.  No word on how much this option will cost, but Summer Rain showers start at about $5500.   Read more in the  urlLink Jacuzzi press release .

        I am high on acesulfame potassium and with so little aftertaste! Since  urlLink Netflix  has become pitifully slow, I was at  urlLink Blockbuster  in the flesh yesterday and they were giving out a free can of  urlLink C2 , the half-diet Coke, with every video or dvd rental. I was so intrigued by the half-carb idea that I also purchased  urlLink Minute Maid Premium Light Orange Juice . I think, actually, they have to call it Orange Juice  Drink  because it's only 42% juice.   The verdict? C2 is half the calories (70 per 12 oz. can) but only about a quarter less delicious than regular Coke. Minute Maid Orange Mostly Juice is more watery and less pulpy than my favorite Tropicana Grovestand, but tastes like real juice.   If my aspartame headache would go away, I'd go buy more of both.

       urlLink CNN  reports that your dad would like you to drop that tie and get on over to Best Buy. Best Buy conducted the survey, by the way, but I'm sure they made the non-electronics choices sound just as appealing as the gadgets available at BestBuyBestBuyBestBuy.  Some suggestions for last-minute shopping:    Buy Dad a Hummer. I mean GM's HUMMER®. I'm a little short on the 50 grand for the H2, but I'm going to splurge on the $29.95   urlLink Hummer Shake Flashlight . 30 seconds of shaking will power up the LED for five minutes. Add  urlLink Outkast's Speakerboxxx  and he'll have the perfect soundtrack while he shakes. Let him go crazy because the Shake Light is shockproof and rubber-coated for protection.       urlLink The Personal Warm+Cool System Wearable Peltier Effect Climate Control  will help your dad keep cool while he mows the lawn. He'll also up his street cred in the neighborhood by looking like an electronic collared felon.      Shower your father with negative ions with the  urlLink Feel-Good Desktop Fan and Negative Ionizer . Negative ions are actually a good thing, and make the stale inside air feel more like the outdoors. Outdoors, in my case, brings a blast of fiery-hot swampiness, but negative ions should help refresh a stuffy office.     The  urlLink Nikon LaserCaddy  has a laser that calculates exact distances between tees and holes and is almost as accurate as the one implanted in the  urlLink brain of a baby boy in 1975 . It won't help anyone's swing, but is sure to look impressive to gadget-mad golf fanatics.     If you're a very very good (and rich) daughter, you can get your dad the ultimate television, the  urlLink RCA Scenium DLP Micro-Display HDTV . 61 inches of picture so clear and so true to life, he'll see Britney's pimples before she does. And his  urlLink anamorphic widescreen  DVDs will look incredible.

        (This review is by the awesome  BRo0Ke .)  My latest gadget is far from being fancy and the technology behind it won't wow anyone. It's so simple that I wonder why nobody hasn't come up with it  sooner. I'm talking about my kitchen savior -  the  urlLink Dawn Power Dish Brush .  I cook my own meal pretty often and am trying  to cook "healthy" as mush as possible. Of course, that usually translates to grilling and not deep  frying or any method with lots of oil involved. And that, my friend, tends to leave you with a very  nasty rough & stubborn stain behind to clean up  and ruin your hands and nails in the process... as if dish washing hasn't done its fair share already.  You would think that when you decide (against  your better judgment) to spend the money on decent cookwares instead of your months-long, lusting after,  wishlisty gadget, the least your investment could do  for you is to *not* add more work to the work amount  it's supposed to reduce. The last time I made my favorite recipe, grilled lemongrass chicken, it took me three days before I could get rid of all the burnt bits and pieces off the so-called nonstick pan. I scrubbed with the sponge. I left hot water in the pan overnight.  I boiled vinegarsolution in it -- pretty much anything I  could think of. Three friggin days of periodically checking in to the kitchen to see whether the stain has "softened up".  Suffice to say, I haven't grilled any lemongrass chicken since.  Then I stumbled upon my knight in a shiny, white (albeit plastic) armor in the cleaning solution aisle one day. It was the last one left on a rather new display that made it kinda stand out. At close inspection, the Dawn Power dish brush is a foot-long stick similar to that of a stick blender, with a rubber button and a replaceable brush head, and runs on batteries (4 AAs) -- sort of like an electric toothbrush for the kitchen. I love my Braun electric toothbrush, so the Dawn brush really appealed to me. My only concern at the time was that the battery-powered brush might not possess enough vigor to fight the seemingly immovable stain foe. Nevertheless, I decided to give it a try anyway since the price was reasonable enough ($8.xx). As an insurance, I also bought  urlLink Dawn Power Dissolver . Just in case. Next stop... poultry section! Can't try the brush without the stain now, can I?  As it turned out, I didn't even need the DPD -- though I have  to say it was a nice added bonus. The brush worked wonderfully with just warm water and the dish washing detergent. Extra pressure was needed here and there, but overall it got the job done in under a minute. Now I'm impressed! These days I use the DPB exclusively for the pots, pans, and the acrylic cutting  board. I found that it also works well in scrubbing off the label glue that was left behind on the surface without leaving any scratching mark, too. So far after a week of daily use,  the brush is still going strong. I have yet to see how long the batteries last, but I estimate that it should last for  a while.  A happily married friend once told me, if she were to have an affair, it would be with her Dyson. I think I now can say the same for me with Dawn Power Dish Brush. Now... if only they  would come up with one for the bathroom!

         urlLink  Transmission  , by Hari Kunzru. A computer programmer plots to save his job by creating a nasty virus, then heroically defeating it. "Lonely paranoid techie" sounds like a caricature but probably used for good comic effect if this is anything like Kunzru's debut,  urlLink  The Impressionist  .      urlLink  The Coma   by the  urlLink not unsightly Alex Garland . I couldn't even finish Garland's last novel,  urlLink  The Tesseract  , but I think he's back, after writing the very creepy  urlLink  28 Days Later  . Plus it's just 144 pages with illustrations, perfect for a one-afternoon read.      urlLink  American Desert  , by Percival Everett. A ghost story by the brilliant author of  urlLink  Erasure  .      urlLink  The Plumber of Souls   by Michael Guinzburg. I just picked this one up at the bookstore without ever reading a review but it involves a priest, a software mogul who makes illegal clones to be his companions, and people who marry their Mad-cow disease ravaged  cows .      urlLink  A Private Life   by Chen Ran. A coming-of-age story set in the era of the Tian'anmen Square demonstrations.      urlLink  What Really Happened to the Class of '93   by Chris Colin. Colin tracked down twenty people from his high school class, shortly before their 10 year reunion to see what had become of their lives. Do you think maybe  everything had changed  and yet at the same time,  nothing had changed at all ? Me too, but I still can't resist.       urlLink  Feed  , by M.T. Anderson. I'm going to pretend this is a recommendation from our  urlLink resident teen  but how can anyone not like a book where kids go to the Moon for Spring Break and have a constant stream of data fed to them so they don't have to read or write or even think? Kind of like now, only without keyboards and monitors.  I can't wait for  urlLink Google  to make this a reality.       urlLink  Sixteen  , edited by Megan McCafferty. I like YA fiction, you have a problem with that? Actually there are some funny stories in here by  urlLink  Candyfreak  Steve Almond  and  urlLink super-chill Ned Vizzini .

         It looks like the web is finally becoming truly global. Domain names in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters are now functioning after many years of development. After downloading the  urlLink Verisign plug-in , I was able to see the Chinese address in Internet Explorer. Now if only I could read Chinese. You can also use the free  urlLink AsiaSurf Explorer .  Several new domains will become available soon, including .eu (Europe) and .Asia. It's also possible that eventually there will be domains for airline flight numbers (type in your flight no. to get status report) or even retail products.  There are more Asians than North Americans online (223 vs. 175 million users) and only 36% of the world's Internet users are native English speakers, yet 68% of the web's content is in English. Maybe the tide is turning a little. I think I'll look into buying stock at  urlLink NJStar .  Register your Chinese, Japanese, or Korean domain at  urlLink Unicode .

      It's all about not giving up. The makers of Viagra, Pfizer, hoped that the drug would work for women as well, and when studies showed that women didn't have the same results (wow, who would have thought)they just gave up. Now Proctor and Gamble is close to getting FDA approval for a testosterone-laced skin patch that's had great results in studies for "increasing satisfying sexual activity" in women.   This could have been a major storyline for Samantha in the   urlLink  Sex and the City movie  .  Read more about   urlLink Intrinsa .

         urlLink Orkut , the invite-only online social network, has a sleazy cousin in  urlLink FunHi . FunHi has gotten so popular, it's decided to bring out the velvet rope. See Google/Gmail/Orkut,  urlLink look what you've spawned .   FunHi users  urlLink post pictures  and if you find them attractive you can buy them  urlLink virtual bling . A platinum bracelet, I mean LuvLinks, may be a steal at $6.99, but that's $6.99 in  real money .  urlLink FunHi's Press Release  claims that in five months of operation, they've sold over 1 million dollars in play loot.   It's actually pretty hilarious. For $.60 you can send someone a pistol. If they're really really hot, you might want to shell out for the $7.29 personal hitman. For just $.70 more, you can get the $Corporate Playa Lair$ on the 125th Floor.   Check out  urlLink FunHi for your mobile .  Find out if you're a  urlLink Gangsta .

        Yahoo is finally putting up a fight to compete with  urlLink free 1GB Gmail accounts . After ignoring all the warnings that my Yahoo Mail Plus Account was about to die, I got this email today:    Dear Yahoo! Mail Plus Subscriber, Thanks for subscribing to Yahoo! Mail Plus. It's our goal to offer you an email experience that makes it easy to stay in touch and offers great value. Periodically, we make changes to enhance the service for our users. As of June 15, 2004, you'll enjoy the following benefits at no additional charge:  -Increase in your storage quota to 2GB  -No graphical ads  -A streamlined interface that's even easier to use     urlLink Yahoo Mail  now offers 100mb of space for their free accounts or 2GB plus POP/SMTP for $19.95 a year for Mail Plus customers. This upgrade has long been rumored, but when I wrote to Yahoo last week I was told that any new pricing/storage limits would not be offered to current Mail Plus customers. I'm so glad I ignored all those billing emails. Look at the disclaimer in today's announcement:   Your Yahoo! Mail Plus purchase will automatically renew each year on the anniversary of the date you originally ordered Yahoo! Mail Plus, at the then-current rate, unless you cancel before that date.   If you're a current Mail Plus customer, you're paying anywhere from $29.95 to $59.95. I'm going to cancel my account (I won't lose my email address or messages, just POP access) and then re-order at the much more reasonable price. With all this space, I hope IMAP access is coming.

        I wrote about the  urlLink iPod speaker bag  a while back, but I think these tiny Rio speakers are a tad more discreet. You can get them in iPod-matching-white, or red, black, or silver. It weighs a mere 3.5 ounces, and the promised battery life of 8 hours means that it will outlast the iPod (and most other hard-drive based music players).   Available for $69.50 at the always cool  urlLink TKNY .

        Whenever anyone mentions pepper spray or Mace, I always say I want to get a personal stun gun. I didn't want to be all talk, so I looked it up and found that these days, tazers are all disguised as cell phones. The  urlLink Cell Phone Stun Gun  combines a 130 dB alarm with 180,000 volts of pure shocking power in a package that looks like an only slightly out-of-date cell phone. It even comes with a leather case, but unfortunately, doesn't come with an actual phone. It will set you back $80 and I'm trying to figure out how much damage it causes. The information is a little vague, but the website assures that there should be  no permanent damage .   They can be purchased at  urlLink Safety Technology . If anyone does any safety testing (not on pets or small children please, unpleasant adults only), please report your results!

        I was searching for a Tibetan prayer wheel the other day, and I came across these  urlLink digital prayer wheels  at  urlLink Dharma Haven .  The mantra "Om Mani Padme Hum" is inscribed in the wheel (or in the gif, in this case) and when you spin it (always counter clockwise) it's supposed have the same effect of inviting blessings as when you chant the words. Dharma Haven says that your hard disk is working as a prayer wheel right now because the mantra (as text on this page), and the gif are spinning around your drive. As I'm going through a period of feeling unsettled and confused (just the last 10-12 years or so, nothing to be too concerned about), I've been seeking serenity or some guidance and decided to download a dozen of the images and let them spin on and on. I'm a skeptic, but since then I've been having the craziest dreams. Maybe they're leading me somewhere, I don't know.   I'm going to buy a copper wheel at  urlLink Tibetan Spirit . I hope Richard Gere will approve.

        It's a sickness (miniphilia?), I know, this love of all things tiny, even if you get a lot less in function, as well as size. When I was little, I begged and begged until my parents bought me a little plastic toy that used the Minox subminiature film that I could never find. Now that I'm an adult, and haven't learned a thing, I had almost convinced myself that I didn't want the  urlLink Philips Keychain Camcorder , but now  urlLink Gizmodo  just discovered something I want much much more, a 3.5 ounce digital camera by Rollei that looks just the classic  urlLink twin lens reflex  model.   It looks to be available only in Japan right now, but I may be booking a trip soon to go pick one up.  I want, I want !  Read and covet at  urlLink Rollei Japan .

        Silly me, I thought the new "Lifestyle" magazine from Ziff-Davis, was going to be a  urlLink sexist piece of garbage . Look at the first cover,  two women !   Look there are more inside:        And unless I'm mistaken and I missed the newest metrosexual trend of belly shirts for boys, I think still another:     I know, I know those are just pictures, but what does Sync have to say about women, right? Lots. There's a handy guide on how to pick up  women who love men who love gadgets . Got that? If you want an  urban fashionista , she can be found at the Apple Store. Soccer moms are most plentiful at Best Buy.   Women are also questioned about the gadgets they like to see guys carrying. Margarita  loves  guys with iPods, but Jenni is so totally not into guys who carry cell phones on their belts because it's the "worst thing ever".   Gotta go lick my iPod now, bye bye.

         urlLink The Red Ferret Journal  unearthed a little Japanese camera that sends pictures of your pet to your cell phone when the motion detector is triggered. I'm always curious about what my dogs do when no one's home, but something tells me that this elaborate gadget would end up sending me dozens of shots per day of my dogs in mid-dream-twitch, probably the only thing that happens all day that could possibly trip the sensor.

        I'll admit that I'm not someone who worries obsessively about panty lines. Actually, I think we should just embrace panty lines as a fashion statement, just like the women in those  urlLink fake painted butt skirts .   I do know lots of people who take panty lines  very seriously , as well as someone(who shall remain nameless) who has to go commando in movie theaters for fear of a wedgie that can't be wiggled away. The wiggle-free (and much more polite) solution is the  urlLink Anti-Panti . These are 100% cotton, disposable, crotch-only stick-ons for your tightest jeans and sheerest pants. You can get a package of 5 for $10, in lots of kitschy patterns like camouflage. One size fits all.  Buy the thong-begone at  urlLink Shop Intuition .

        If I could have a super power, it would be the ability to speak with animals. Although this is more of a one way function, it's one step closer.  urlLink Bow-lingual , previously only available in Japan, works as a kind of dog translator. It takes your dog's bark and analyzes it into happiness, sadness, frustration, assertiveness, neediness or if they're being territorial. Then it turns the feeling into statement like "I'm ready to play" or "leave me alone". It comes pre-set for some breeds already. Home alone mode records your dog's feelings for up to twelve hours, although I hope you won't be leaving your dog alone for that long. You can get it at  urlLink Petsmart  or  urlLink Advanced Pet Products .   The translator is a wireless microphone you hook onto your dog's collar with a counter part looks like a small walkie-talkie. It's about $60, not too bad, but the thing is, somebody should probably be able to understand enough of what your dog is trying to communicate to you to understand if they're hungry or if they want to go out or if they want to play. This is the kind of thing that probably will be used more as a toy than as a necessity.   We just ordered ours, so a full review and pictures are to come.

        There are tons of  urlLink hair-removal  lasers, so this was inevitable, I suppose. The  urlLink The Hairmax Laser Comb  "activates cells" that stimulate the hair follicles, which is supposed to give you fuller, healthier hair. It's a low-level cold-beam laser so you won't end up with scalp burns in any case.   I would buy it for my ever-shedding dogs if it didn't cost $700.  Get yours at  urlLink Blissworld .

        What happens when you gather together the CEOs of the world's biggest tech companies at the  urlLink exclusive  All Things Digital  conference ? They indulge in some toilet and bidet humor, apparently. According to the  urlLink Washington Post's Leslie Walker , when  urlLink Toto  presented their high-tech toilet, the crowd, which included Bill Gates, Larry Ellison, and Steve Jobs, erupted into giggles.  I don't see what's so funny about it. The  urlLink Neorest  is a must-have for any ultra-hygienic OCD case. The Neorest's features include a seat warmer, a sensor that opens the seat as you approach, auto cleaning for both the toilet and the user, and the  urlLink Cyclone Flush . There are so many features, it comes with an lcd-equipped wireless remote so you can control them all.  I'm hoping that Toto comes up with a porta-potty version for outdoor concert venues.   Watch the   urlLink Cyclone Flush in action .

         urlLink Vizoo , a Danish company, has innovated the use of holographic imaging for use in video ads. On the sample reel there's an example of this technology in use, as a holographic model dresses and undresses in a Copenhagen shop window. Gawkers abound, as you can imagine.   urlLink AdRants  imagines that these holographic models could be used to accost customers walking down the street. I'd like that because I wouldn't feel guilty about glaring at them and walking the other way. In any case, even these glowing ghost-like images are less creepy than those  urlLink living mannequins .

        You might argue that there's no noticeable time difference between rice that can be cooked in five minutes on the stove and rice that can be microwaved in just two minutes.  The stovetop variety is cheaper and gives you the satisfaction of feeling like you're actually cooking (though it doesn't have that effect on me, and I think it tastes like shredded cardboard).  But I have encountered many situations where I have to feed someone in just three minutes, or have to pack a lunch on the run (we don't do sandwiches at my house, I don't know why), and on those occasions, I congratulate myself for having the foresight to purchase these little packages of Japanese microwavable rice at my local Asian market (you can also get them online at  urlLink Midori Mart ).  And unlike the stovetop variety available in your regular grocery store, this rice looks and tastes like real Japanese steamed rice.  It's nice and sticky and won't fly off your chopsticks

Some really amazing directors, like  urlLink Wong Kar-Wai  and  urlLink Ang Lee  participated but the concept didn't really seem to take off. Now it's back.   There are the  urlLink Nike Art of Speed  shorts by 15 young directors.   While not officially commissioned by Apple,  urlLink Cherry Sky Films  has produced a series of five shorts, all centered around the mighty iPod and collectively dubbed the  SkyPod Shorts .  Cherry Sky produced  urlLink Better Luck Tomorrow , the movie that launched the career of  urlLink Justin Lin .   Like the BMW films, the SkyPod shorts aren't really films at all, but glossy, extended commercials. The shorts range from arty and hypnotic ( Dream, Lover ) to silly (the straight-out-of-a Hilary Duff movie,  Glowsticks & Drumsticks ).   The SkyPod shorts are actually more like odes to Final Cut Pro than they are to the iPod. Although each filmmaker was given a budget of less than $4500, you'd never know it from the elegant production values. While I wasn't blown away by any of the films, it really hit me how much low-budget filmmaking has been revolutionized by products like FCP. These films weren't choppy or sloppy, they had all the technical grace of the ultra-high budget BMW shorts.   Hey everyone, go out and film your stories, make your movies. Anyone can do it now, it's incredible.  Ah okay, the SkyPod shorts aren't viewable online yet, as they're still being shown in festivals, but should be up at some point in the fall. You can get screening dates from the   urlLink Cherry Sky  site.

        I know a lot of people have been waiting for ages for  urlLink Coach  to resurrect their iPod cases, and well, there's good news and bad news. The good news is they  have  brought back the case, in the high quality durable leather that Coach is known for. The bad news is that the only one I've seen (in July's American  Elle ) is  Python . Very swank, but probably not for everyone. If their handbag rules apply, then classic black will surely follow. The glamourous python case is $118. It should be available beginning in July.

      I just don't know what to say about this. A  urlLink five-country study of gender issues in IT  has concluded that women don't go into technology fields because they don't want to be seen as socially misfit geeks. Many of the women in the study said they felt that the technology career path was dominated by men and they felt unwelcome in the field. This is understandable but the study's conclusion baffles me. Women feel unwelcome in a world dominated by men, but really, they don't go to work in the tech industry because it's  just not cool . The study had a noble goal- to try and figure out why there was such a huge gender gap, but it seems to have delved about an inch deep into the matter.  I think I'll stop reading and go back to my basement with my 80 computers and my XBox. Thank goodness I don't have any friends to keep me from my all-day, all-night gaming and coding.

        15-year-old Pierce Spencer may be the biggest of all the  urlLink Gmail racketeers . Spencer has been buying the accounts and then re-selling them on Ebay for as much as $102.50 a pop. He's sold more than 50 now, and made over $1000. He hopes to make enough to buy an Audi. After that, hopefully he'll get a driver's license.  I was as excited as anyone when the Gmail announcement was made, but after using the service for a couple months now (username  miakim ), my ardor has waned a good deal. Unless you're a fan of web-only mail, it's a bit of a pain to keep track of, and the threaded organization (into "conversations", like on Usenet) is sometimes as confusing as it is helpful. The 1 gig of storage is nice, but unless you never download your mail locally, even the 10-50mb limits that are commonly offered by most ISPs are likely to be sufficient for most users. If you're still longing for the extra space and can't wait for Gmail to become public, there are alternatives. My main account these days is with  urlLink Fusemail , which offers 100mb IMAP accounts for $20 a year but you can buy up to 2GB of storage ($14.99 a month). They offer a free 30-day trial. A friend just pointed out   urlLink AventureMail , which offers  2 GB Free Storage . AventureMail is definitely gunning for Gmail, as they state several times that they will NEVER use ads, which means of course, that at some point their service will not be free. It's also webmail only at this point.   Read more about the  urlLink the Gmail pimp .

        Following on the heels of earlier Pepsi and Ben&Jerry's iTunes giveaways, 7-11 is now doing their own music promotion with Coca Cola.  urlLink Slurpee Summer Music Fest 2004  is giving away  urlLink MusicMatch downloads , cell phone ringtones and graphics, as well as some bigger prizes like mp3 players, cell phones, and the grand prize, a trip to the  urlLink Reading Festival . This year's Reading lineup includes Morrissey, 50 Cent, and The White Stripes.   I don't work for 7-11, but my parents did own a franchise for many years, so please excuse my 7-11 enthusiasm. Go 7-11! I remember an old giveaway in the early 80's where I won about 50 t-shirts with pictures of slurpees on them. Back then, the slurpee cups just had a tab at the bottom where you got your game card. For this round, you'll need to punch in the number from your slurpee cup at the  urlLink headache inducingly noisy Slurpee site . But you can avoid the Flash madness a little by skippping to the mercifully "music"-less   urlLink contest site . I'm going to be singing the "slurp slurp" ditty all day.   The Pepsi contest was sort of fun, especially after MacMerc discovered how to  urlLink be a winner every time . If I discover any such thing for Slurpee, I won't hold out, I promise. Oh, one more Slurpee tip from an expert: the new Diet Pepsi slurpee is very tasty for anyone avoiding carbs (not me). However, considering this is a Coca-Cola thing, you'll probably have to gulp some sugar until the promotion is over.

        Now I really want one of these  urlLink USB Air Purifiers  from  urlLink Compact-Impact .   A new study by  urlLink Clean Production Action  and  urlLink Computer Take Back  found neurotoxic chemicals in the dust of every computer included in their testing. The worst offender was PBDE(polybrominated diphenyl ether), which is a widely used flame retardant that has caused health problems in lab animals. PBDEs aren't just in your computer dust either, they're all over most electronic devices and the levels are getting higher every year, especially in North America.  Becoming a Luddite is no solution, since the problem is global and unless you're prepared to create your own  urlLink biosphere , you're unlikely to escape PBDEs. One way to help directly is to  urlLink recycle your own electronics  and urge companies and your local and federal government to do it more of it as well. Spreading the word about PBDEs is crucial so that corporations will feel some pressure to start phasing out the use of these toxic chemicals.  Read more from  urlLink CNET .

        Oh Janet, was it really worth the publicity? Your CD didn't even sell that well and I hold you responsible for making young girls want to wear bathing suits like this one. Yes, that's a  bathing suit .  urlLink Pantaloons  are the new  thong .   Okay, so it was actually 11-year old Ella Gunderson, who wrote to Nordstrom to complain that the clothing was too revealing. Now Ella is being heralded as "Miss Modesty" and is spawning a whole new trend of covering up from head to toe. The new line  urlLink Modest By Design's  slogan is "Clothing Your Father Would Approve Of."  Oh joy.  Do you hear that sound? That's Britney Spears weeping.  Read more  urlLink here .

        I will not give in and buy the gimmicky little  urlLink Philips Keychain Camcorder . Sure it weighs just over an ounce, but it's just a 2 megapixel camera, and you can't add to the meager 128mb of built-in storage. That's less than a half hour of mpeg-4 video. It will, however, have the  urlLink Kopin CyberDisplay , about the size of a grain of rice, which when coupled with magnifying optics, can create a virtual display as clear and as accurate as a true optical image. Because the display is so very very teeny, it uses much less battery power than a full-sized LCD, very important when you're talking about a take-everywhere device.   I will not give in and buy the Philips Keycorder. I'm 50% sure of that.  Read more in the  urlLink Kopin Press Release .

        See how pissed off that robot looks? He must have just seen his movie,  urlLink  I, Robot  . Unless the   urlLink   I, Robot  trailer   was deliberately bad, so that audiences would be pleasantly surprised by the real thing, this robot is going to be firing his agents in pretty short order. At least  urlLink Isaac Asimov  won't have to watch. The new first law of robotics? Read the  urlLink classic book of short stories  instead.  If you want to see an intelligent, thought-provoking movie about robots, check out  urlLink Greg Pak's   urlLink  Robot Stories  . Pak's film explores the human side of a future shared with robots in a series of four vignettes. The brilliant  urlLink Rania Ho  designed the egg-like, somewhat low-tech-looking surrogate child in the first story,  My Robot Baby , and it's a hilarious visual gag on the chicken eggs kids have to nurture in junior-high Health class. I liked the last story the best,  Clay , in which an elderly man must decide whether or not to upload himself into a Matrix-like computer and discard his ailing body. Sab Shimono is amazing as the man who's not quite sure if his uploaded wife is really his wife or just a set of 1s and 0s masquerading as his lost love.  It's only showing in select cities now, but hopefully will get a wider release soon.   Watch the  urlLink  Robot Stories  trailer .

        Know anyone who is so dependent on their cell phone, PDA, digital camera, etc... that they can't leave them behind even when they go to the beach? No? Okay, me neither then. But if you did, say, want to carry your Treo with you while you white water raft, the  urlLink Aqua Pruff Accessory Bag  is something you'll want. These neoprene (synthetic foam rubber) bags are waterproof, sand-resistant, and they float. Now if you have to dive into rough waters to rescue your valuables, you'll have a fighting chance.

        I really want to order a bag this week but I keep seeing more and more I like, although I wish I could see them in person to feel the fabric and see how heavy they are. My old bag is twice as heavy as my computer.    These bags are from  urlLink Cased Closed Bags , a company owned by April Lockhart and Debra Wong, who longed to have stylish laptop cases that were affordable. Cased Closed comes in ten styles, from the casual Messenger style  Larry Jr . to the more business-like  Neal Collection . The Bob style is my favorite because they're compact enough to function as sleeves for a larger bag, and you can get cool linings like gingham or  urlLink sushi .   I am now coveting the  urlLink Levenger Laptop PJs . These cute pastel colored leather bags never have to come off since they have a "trap door" that gives you access to all your ports. There's also an adjustable band for added protection, so your computer gets a snug custom fit. Sounds just about perfect and the price isn't too bad either at $119. We may have a winner.

        I finally came across the newest thing in breath mints today: the gelatinous little  urlLink Momints . And after all the   urlLink Momints hype  in glossy magazines like  InStyle , I found them in a 7-11. [note to 7-11: please re-think the banana slurpees, blech.] Please don't ask me why, but I'd actually wondered after seeing pictures, if these mints were like little tiny hard candies or something that you chewed or maybe even swallowed. The answer? Neither! They are like those bath oil beads that instantly dissolve in hot water and start gushing out artificial rose-scented grease, only the mints contain a tasty/nasty (75% tasty) liquid like the kind inside of Freshen Up gum. They're not as strong as Altoids or those lethal Listerine breath strips, but instead leave a Lifesaver level of mint taste in your mouth.  The most fun part, though, is when the liquid is gone and you just have the bits of gelatin stuck to your tongue. It's just like when you were little and eating  urlLink Botan Rice Candy , with the rice paper covering that seemed for all the world like something inedible until it started to dissolve in your mouth. I suppose inedible things could also dissolve (like Lemon Pledge maybe), but Botan really is just rice, you can eat it, it's true. At least that's what my sister told me. It's also possible that this is not universally nostalgia-inducing and you may find it a little gross but just wait 15 seconds, and the mo-mint will be over.

        Now that I've really started to look, I'm finding more laptop bags that don't look boringly regulation, but can actually protect your computer. First there's the  urlLink Mobile Edge Messenger Bag , which has extra padding, comfort shoulder straps and an expansion panel for pack rats like me. The  urlLink Mobile Edge Totes  don't scream "laptop bag" at all and could easily pass as a regular handbag if you like your totes Winona-sized.    The Sakar iConcepts Explorer is so weird-looking, I love it. It's cheap ($20-$50), extremely durable, and somewhere between military chic and amphibian. It should be available at  urlLink CompUSA  this summer.     JZMO has the funkiest looking-bags, and although they don't look it, they are designed for business, with pockets for your PDA and business cards, and extra-thick padding. Also, 100% of the profits from sales of the Limited Edition Executive Bag, in pink leather and suede, will go to breast cancer charities. The  urlLink Think Pink Bag  can be pre-ordered now for $249.      urlLink Xeni Jardin , of  urlLink BoingBoing  wrote in  urlLink Gizmodo  about her  urlLink Talene Reilly Silouette Bag . This might be the best-looking of all the bags I've looked at, plus it has a pocket for the power cord (power cord pocket=love) and a teflon coating which makes the fabric water and stain repellant. It's also much pricier than the others, at $315-$358. Wouldn't you know it...

        Don't you feel a little funny when you're at a party, all dressed up, and your companion, the one you can always talk to when your social anxiety is acting up, the one who protects you from creepy drunk guys, is basically well, naked?  Yes, it's true, you can at last get a tuxedo for your cell phone. The  urlLink Bytech Tux Shuttle  is a black rubber case with leather and metal trim that should go beautifully with your own formal wear. The Shuttle clip releases at the touch of a button should you decide to wear your now "elegant" accessory on your belt.

         Speaking of food of the future, it looks like it's going to be less about freeze-drying and more about genetic modification.   An excellent documentary,  urlLink The Future of Food,  by Deborah Koons Garcia, exposes how little we know about the foods we eat.&nbsp; For years we've all been eating genetically modified food and never been made aware of it because of lack of product labeling. Garcia's film is chilling, not just for what it spells for the future, but because of what she uncovers happening everyday  already .  While the film is still screening at festivals nationwide, it will also be available at the end of July on VHS and DVD for $20. &nbsp;You can purchase your copy at the  urlLink Future of Food  site.

         Nothing makes me angrier than a ticket from a traffic camera. You can't argue with a camera and I'm never convinced that I was doing anything wrong; all I can see for sure is that it's a picture of my car. The fact that I probably was speeding doesn't make me feel any better. It all just feels a little dirty and unfair. You can fight back by being really clean, super-shiny clean.    urlLink PhotoStopper  makes your license plate so shiny that using a flash to take a picture of it will result in glare. Without further enhancement of the photo, the license plate numbers will be unreadable. It's not illegal (yet) in most states since the gloss is clear and not obstructing the numbers to the naked eye. At $19.95, it's cheaper than a ticket.

       urlLink      If shrinking clothes was an Olympic sport, my mother could have been the event's Carl Lewis.&nbsp; I can still shed a tear thinking about what happened to my  urlLink favorite skirt  in 6th grade.&nbsp; That tragedy could have been avoided if we'd had a&nbsp; urlLink Maytag Neptune&nbsp;Drying Center . The Neptune has both a regular dryer and an upper drying closet that lets you speed-air-dry items without risking shrinkage.&nbsp; You can even add fragrance to the air to mimic the scent of fresh air dried items.&nbsp;   Win a Neptune and a year's worth of "drying supplies" in the  urlLink Maytag Sweepstakes .

         People have been asking me about where to get nice passport covers, and these simple micro-fiber ones are the nicest I've seen.  &nbsp;  Of course, once you have your ticket you have about a million documents you need to keep stashed nearby so you might need a matching document case.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;    &nbsp; The passport cover is $12, the doc case is $25. You can find both at the ultimate travel goods store,  urlLink Flight OO1 .

         &nbsp;  First in line to be the  urlLink Tickle-me-Elmo  of Christmas season 2004 are these squishy little  urlLink Mogu People . Mogu People are&nbsp;human (sort-of) shaped versions of those  urlLink stress-relief pillows . Mogu people aren't just "huggable companions", they are mythic beings, each one representing a "Power We All Possess". Sounds a little scary, yes, but they're talking about things like courage, curiousity, dream, love, sucess, or joy. Joy is especially cute, with her multi-colored bubble body.  &nbsp;  The Mogu People are already available as screensavers for cell phones. Following the fall release of the pillows, there will be t-shirts, watches, toys, bags, and hats.  &nbsp;  Reserve yours now at  urlLink Mogu &nbsp;if you want to be able to sell it on Ebay in December.  &nbsp;

        &nbsp; I could easily kill a cactus in under a week, so if I ever&nbsp;want a garden&nbsp;I'll need to plant everything in  urlLink Wonder Soil . Wonder Soil is fertilizer-rich dehydrated peat which expands when you add water. One 14 oz. container is equivalent to 10 lbs. of regular soil.&nbsp; Polymers in the soil time-release water so if you're a once a week (or month) &nbsp;waterer like I am, your plants may still survive. &nbsp;

        &nbsp; You've probably already heard about those  urlLink Masai Anti-Cellulite Sneakers , but for summer, you're probably better off with the  urlLink MBT Barefoot Sandals . These shoes are supposed to make the flat concrete more like bumpy natural terrain, which tones your muscles as you walk.&nbsp; Some wearers also claim&nbsp;that regular use has greatly improved their posture and rid them of back pain.&nbsp; In any case, I would love for these to become the new "It Shoe" since I would never be able to walk in  urlLink Manolos , even if I could afford them.

      In my middle class mind, I think that in between  urlLink shopping sprees , Oprah just takes a nap while  urlLink Bob Greene &nbsp;manipulates her muscles in her sleep. I suppose it's not that easy, even for Oprah, but that all may change soon.&nbsp; Australian scientists are working on a "vanity drug" which would simulate the effects of execise by activating an enzyme that boosts metabolism. While the drug won't actually build muscle, it could potentially help you lose fat without dieting. &nbsp; In a society that measures prosperity by seeing how  urlLink skinny  you can get without actually dying, what would happen if looking like Jennifer Aniston was the norm?

         &nbsp;  The  urlLink Sprint Picture Phone 8920 &nbsp;is the first megapixel camera phone to hit the US market.&nbsp; While  urlLink much more impressive camera phones &nbsp;are around the corner, the 1.3 MP 8920 will be a marked improvement over what is available&nbsp;on cell phones today. You might actually be able to make decent small prints with this.&nbsp; The phone also has a built-in flash, a timer for those self-portraits, and an 8x digital zoom (not a real optical zoom, it's just in-camera enlargement) as well as a macro mode .&nbsp; It's a decent phone too, with a built-in speaker and almost 6 hours of talk time (with 10 days standby.) All this and it's tiny, under 4 0z.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The phone is $300, but new customers to Sprint PCS are eligible for instant rebates up to $150.  &nbsp;  Read  urlLink CNET's review .

          &nbsp;  If you've ever pulled out&nbsp;&nbsp;concealer in a dark car and applied it to your lips thinking it was gloss, then the  urlLink Light Up Bag &nbsp;will be a lifesaver for you (and for me, since I've done this at least twice.)&nbsp; The neon lining of these classic looking bags isn't just&nbsp;bright pink, it's an actual light. The bags are made of&nbsp;soft, supple leather in pink, orange, turquoise, and lime (as well as classic black) and just need&nbsp;two easily replaceable&nbsp;AA batteries.  &nbsp; Makeup tip: Nothing is as unsettling as beige lips; playing sick is easy as pie with a coat of  urlLink Quick Corrector .&nbsp; You may just score a few extra weeks of sick pay. &nbsp;

            I   think we used to call them bean bags…&nbsp; Now… an updated polymer bead…&nbsp; a soft pleasing cover in an array of bright colors… and, presto…&nbsp; the Föm pillow is born.&nbsp; Available from   urlLink  Brookstone   , the Föm pillow line is the latest answer to stress relief and sleeping comfort.&nbsp; The original Föm was a watermelon-sized stress reliever.&nbsp; After a warm reception to it’s first style, the line was expanded to include models geared towards sleeping comfort and travel.  &nbsp;  Although Brookstone’s pillows have a catchy name and are available in seemingly every mall in America, the concept is not an original one.&nbsp; The original polystyrene powder bead (the substance inside) was introduced to the U.S. from Japan and was called the MOGU.  &nbsp;   urlLink  MOGUs    are available online&nbsp;and come in a variety of shapes and colors much more extensive than the Föm line.  &nbsp;  In either case, once you try one you are sure to be hooked.&nbsp; I can’t resist stopping by Brookstone anytime I’m in the mall.&nbsp; In fact…&nbsp; I’m having dinner with the assistant manager on Thursday night ;)

          urlLink Gear Live  has gotten reports that  urlLink freeipods.com  is actually is making good on their promise to send you an iPod mini, 15GB model, or $250 in iTunes downloads for free. Of course nothing is really for free, and you'll have to agree to put five friends on their spam list and sign up for one of the "great offers" (AOL Broadband, Columbia House DVD club, Petcare RX, Citibank credit cards for  students, etc...).   Please please please don't give freeipods.com the real email addresses of your friends unless you were getting sick of them anyway. My suggestion is that you set up a group using disposable email addresses ( urlLink Spamex ,  urlLink Spam Gourmet ) and then you can delete the temporary addresses when everyone has their iPod. Oh and don't forget to cancel that subscription to the Columbia House DVD club. Do you really want them to send you  urlLink Daddy Day Care , which appears to be their monthly selection every month?

        Get back at your noisy neighbors by playing the  urlLink Revenge CD .

        I'm obsessed with car air fresheners but 99% of them smell absolutely putrid. Who knows what a  urlLink mystical garden  is supposed to smell like? Bath and Body Works has a new car fragrance system that uses their trademark clean, light scents like Cucumber Melon and Mango Mandarin. The brushed silver AutoFresh unit clips onto your car's air vents and the unit's own vents can be adjusted to increase/decrease the amount of fragrance dispersed into the air. I found Coconut Lime to be disturbingly strong and fake-smelling, but Fresh Linen is soft and unobtrusive.    If you're on Atkins, the fruity choices at Bath and Body Works may not appeal to you. You might prefer the savory scent of barbecue in the  urlLink T-bone Air Freshener .

        The  urlLink Bug Wand  may not be super high-tech, but it's going to change my life. I'm extremely bug phobic but also hyper-empathetic so while I end up drowning spiders that show up in my shower, it always leads to hours of sadly wondering if ants have souls or if beetles love their mothers. Also, number one on my list of reasons to someday get married is: husband = bug killer.  The Bug Wand lets you be squeamish and kind at the same time because it sucks up the bug, but doesn't kill it. You can stand several feet away from the little pest and the battery-operated wand will suck it into the tube, where you trap it only until you can get it outside to fly/crawl away into the great outdoors. Or your neighbor's house.  Get the Bug Wand or other  urlLink amazing products  at  urlLink As Seen On TV .

Following the success of pineapple growers who developed sweeter pineapple varieties, growers in Japan and the Philippines are growing sweeter varieties of bananas.

Bananas already come in a variety of wild colors, but not all are edible.

        If you've ever wished you could read magazines while looking like you were working, then  urlLink Zinio  is for you. While newspapers and magazines have been online for many years, websites don't always provide the full text available in print versions and the non-linear format is a very different experience even if you can find what you're looking for. Zinio provides a digital magazine that is identical to the print one: one third magazine, two thirds advertisements.  I'm the last person in the world who needs more magazines. I read them on my Treo in  urlLink eReader  format, I have them read to me as  urlLink Audible Audio , and I buy and subscribe to more magazines than any ten people could get through. My house literally bleeds magazines. If you bump into anything, a flood of  Time  (somehow I always manage to get through  US  and  People , but I still hope to catch up on my 11,000 unread  New Yorkers ) and  Newsweek  will rain down on you.  Even so, Zinio is my new obsession. The Zinio format looks like a PDF, but is encrypted much like an iTunes download. You need a Zinio account and the Zinio reader to read the magazines. A typical photo-filled glossy magazine  like  Business Week  is about 15mb. Most pages are readable in the default two page layout, but you may need to zoom in on some print. I've found that reading on the monitor helps me get through the magazine quickly. Maybe it's because I'm so used to trying to work efficiently on a computer, while I tend to linger over a magazine.  I only wish the Zinio selection was better. It's new and still expanding, but right now the options are heavily focused in business and technology. I'd kill for an  InTouch . Sometimes the magazines are cheaper this way too. You can get my  urlLink favorite magazine  for $4.99 a year.   Try out Zinio by getting a  urlLink free sample .

        Emails can be such a letdown, especially on Mondays.  It’s tough to start the week out with no news from friends in exotic places, no invitations to lunch so I can look forward to escaping the tedium, no offers for more lucrative work. There's only the message from Tiffany, who wants to get to know me better because she's heard so much about me from an unidentified mutual friend who seems to have forgotten my gender and sexual leaning.  But, wait, emerging from the darkness is a note for me from the Universe:   However trite this may now sound, you are a Being of Light with dominion over all things. The earth, sun, moon and stars are your manifestations. You are amazing, eternal, blessed beyond measure, and at the dawn of an adventure that will see all of your dreams come true. . . . “  TTFN, The Universe  You can get your own notes from the Universe courtesy of  urlLink Totally Unique Thoughts .  In your profile, you select one material desire and one goal, and then choose to receive daily or weekly messages.  The motto of TUT and Mike Dooley, the self-help guru behind TUT, is that "thoughts become things."  But if the positive affirmations get to be too much, you can unsubscribe with just a click of a button.

He hasn't escaped from IT into the executive ranks like his good friend Barbie over at  urlLink Mattel .      And while he vows never to give up on his fantasy of one day moving into the Dream House, he's starting to get that Bobbie, one of the  urlLink Dyke Dolls , is probably more than just Barbie's "yoga buddy".     About the Dyke Dolls, From the Press Release:    Doesn’t Everyone Want to Play With a Lesbian ? Dyke Dolls titillates the public by launching the world's first series of lesbian action figures. The flagship doll is a limited edition of the butchie “Bobbie Doll”, who, fit and poised in denim jeans and boots, is all boy on the outside but all woman underneath.  Dyke Dolls is the inspiration of creator/founder, Stephanie Perdomo. It began as an NYU graduate school thesis project.

         So, you got on the bandwagon when the  urlLink Motorola V60  was the hottest thing going in cell phones.  And it was... sleek metal casing and brilliant functionality in a tiny (yet still workable) clamshell design.  No wonder that it so quickly became a girl's best friend.  Get ready for the next step in evolution and what promises to be the next v60...  Introducing the  urlLink Motorola v710 .  Still sleek, still tiny, still workable, but now with an explosive list of features:  • Hi-res 1.2-megapixel camera with auto timer and flash • Bluetooth® connectivity • 128MB Trans-Flash memory • Video clip capture and playback • "Office-quality" speakerphone • Integrated MP3 player, MP3/MIDI ringers • 2.2” active color display • Voice-activated dialing • External color display and picture caller ID • WAP 2.0 • PC sync with Mobile PhoneTools version 2.0 • Expandable memory with SD-compatible removable memory slot  Motorola seems to have done it again!  The expected release date is looking like some time in early Q3 of this year.  Verizon seems to be a definite carrier, with Sprint as a possible second.  Hello moto!

There's only one problem...  cell phone cases come in black, black, or black.  Though we mustn't eschew the value of black, it just doesn't evoke any vision of sassy, summer fun.

        People have been leaving personalized AOL Instant Messenger "away" messages for years now, usually just to let friends know when they'll be back. In April, a George Washington University student let his friends know that he would never be coming back; he left his suicide note on IM for anyone who tried to ping him. While that will be hard to top, it turns out many kids take their IM away message as seriously as their live chatting, updating it as often as 30 times a day. Song lyrics and obscure quotes are popular choices.  A couple of college students even turned away messaging into their thesis project,  urlLink BuddyGopher , a buddy bot that collects all your buddies' away messages so you can keep up with them all. Looks like the service isn't open to new users right now but with Google dreams in their eyes, the two guys are hard at work to get BuddyGopher working for more users. In the meantime, brush up on your Nietzsche.  g2g c U 2moro  Read more from the  urlLink Washington Post .  Translate English into chat lingo at  urlLink Transl8it .

        When I was a kid, I had a little cotton candy machine which, after a half hour of coaxing and wishful thinking, made a tiny bit of delicious, pink fluff about the size of an actual cottonball.  I once bought my own daughter a hand-held, battery-operated machine from a toy store, which made alot of noise and gave out after three uses.  We were both underwhelmed.  And those bags of stiff, compacted cotton candy sold at the video store alongside microwave popcorn just doesn't cut it.  Real cotton candy should melt in your mouth the instant you put it in - the whole experience should be dreamy and ephemeral.  A real cotton candy machine like those used at carnivals can run you over $1,500.  I found that even entry-level professional machines are around $500 or $600.  I just want one that I can keep on my kitchen counter.  I came across this "Nostalgia Cotton Candy Maker and Fun Kit" at  urlLink overstock.com  for a mere $47.99.

        I have found that most writing software is either condescending to the writer (if you don't already know about the basic elements and structure of fiction, you should take a class rather than buy software that talks to you like you're a moron), or so cumbersome to use that you lose your creative drive and spirit in the effort to keep your jottings organized.  Still, I'm always hopeful that someone will come up with a program that can manage hundreds of scattered notes and vignettes, and can keep me from going off on wild tangents that have nothing to do with my story, all without making me feel like I'm cheating the artistic process by reducing it to an idiotic formula that would be an embarassment if anyone found out about it.  I'm trying out  urlLink newnovelist  software, developed in the UK and edited by the great great-granddaughter of Charles Dickens.  The program takes you through six stages of writing your novel by forcing you to think and write about each element of character and plot development.  I'll report back in a couple of weeks on whether I think it's a useful tool for combating writer's block or just another method of procrastination.

        A few weeks ago, I wrote about the  urlLink Hairmax Laser Comb , which purports to grow thicker hair. Now   urlLink Bliss Spa  is selling a laser for use on facial skin, the  urlLink Beurer Softlaser Healer . The low-level laser is supposed to stimulate collagen production which helps with wrinkles, scars, and acne. Bliss says this is accomplished through the "right UV rays". I don't know what that means, I thought all UV rays were bad for skin, but some people at the  urlLink YTF! Beauty Report Forum  have reported good results, especially with acne. The Beurer Laser is $219, while the Hairmax is $700. I would think you could run the Beurer across your thinning pate as well, but maybe the "right UV rays" are the kind that kill hair follicles.   The efficacy of lasers has long been debated and the  urlLink latest study  found that lasers had little effect on acne. One session with a big gun like the  urlLink Smoothbeam , which is FDA approved for acne and scars costs about $400, so maybe now is the time to embrace the DIY spirit.

        Well the momint is officially over for those bubblelicious  urlLink Momints . Many A-list Hollywood types, trying hard to be indie at Sundance, were spotted carrying  urlLink Oral Fixation Mints . They come in chi chi flavors like Mojito Mint and Caffeinated Chai with each mint inscribed "FIX" on one side, and a little symbol for each flavor on the other. The slim brushed metal tins look like packs of  urlLink Dunhills  and OralFix suggests they be re-used as wallets when the mints are gone. $3.50 is kind of steep for 40 mints, so yes I think I will be using the cases as little sachets for my purse.   You can get a mix and match box of 12 tins for $30 at  urlLink OralFix .

        It didn't work for poor  urlLink Uncle Rico , but you can try for yourself by purchasing time travel plans at  urlLink Future Horizons . Future Horizons admits their products are highly experimental but the Ecktoplasmic Oscillator sounds promising. Some of these plans are for out-of-body time travel, but if you can build the Hyperdimensional Resonator, you may be able to travel in corporeal form, which would be my preference.  If it works for you, will you look me up in 1999 and tell me to go to law school? That dotcom thing didn't go so well and the parental nagging  will never stop .

      For the very first time, bloggers will be among the 15,000 accredited members of the press covering the Democratic National Convention which starts on July 26th. The Democratic National Committee has also started its own blog,  urlLink Boston D Party , written by  urlLink Matt Stoller  and former Al Gore speech writer  urlLink Eric Schnure .  The Republicans have followed suit and will issue press passes to select bloggers for their own convention which takes place in late August. The party has not yet published its own official convention blog, but one is in the making.   The site that brought political blogging into the mainstream,  urlLink Howard Dean's Blog for America , is still alive and kicking, and gearing up for the big political season.  Now that bloggers have been given a real voice in this election, I hope one of those press passes doesn't go to  urlLink Washingtonienne .

        When Zelda's graphic design changed in The Wind Waker game, I was fairly surprised. I didn't mind it at all, I actually thought the cartoonish look was very cute and a nice change. It certainly didn't take away from the game at all. In the Four Swords Adventures, the graphics - although playable one both GameCube and GameBoy Advanced - were obviously meant for the GameBoy. Still, many people would agree that the game is one of the better Zelda games, although to play multi-player you need to have as many GameBoy Advanced and GameCube GameBoy Advanced cables as players.  In 2005, Zelda will go back to it's original style of graphics with The Legend of Zelda (working title) for GameCube. From what I've seen of it, the new game's graphics are even more realistic than before (but I mean, that's comparing Nintendo64 graphics with GameCube graphics so it ought to be). As for whether the game and the story are as appealing as the graphics, we'll just have to wait and see. All I know is that it takes place before Windwaker and after Ocarina of Time and Link is adult Link.   Watch the trailer for the game at  urlLink IGN .

        What do you get for that person who has everything? I can almost guarantee they don't have  urlLink Protein Profiler Plus , a kit which lets you display your own genetic code in art form, kind of like a forensic-era  urlLink Warhol painting .  The kit includes a sterile mouth swab, gloves, and a "DNA postal envelope". After your DNA image is made, it will be hand-painted onto a canvas in the color scheme of your choice. The price for such a unique service is actually quite reasonable, about $440.   Forget about  urlLink Glamour Shots , get your DNA Profile from the  urlLink Protein Store  and then make wallet-sizes for all your admirers.

        Well maybe it's not aliens, but something is jamming the signal for car entry remotes in Waldorf, Maryland, a town about 20 miles south of the nation's capital. By one local's account, on at least five occasions in the last year, keyless remotes all over town mysteriously stopped working for about 20 minutes each time. While those old-fashioned metal keys still work, some engines require the remote before they can be started as an additional safety measure.   Some people have heard that NASA satellites are involved, but the most likely culprit is the 300 ft. microwave tower, used by AT&T to coordinate long-distance and cell calls. The tower manager, Dave Clark, does say that on some occasions the tower sends out a different signal. Another tower employee says that the second type of signal is issued by the "government" but said he couldn't say more nor would he give his name.   Someone, please let  urlLink M. Night Shyamalan  know about this.   Read more from the  urlLink Washington Post  (registration required.)

        I think everyone knows by now that the single most important thing to consider when creating products for women is the inclusion of the vanity mirror. I don't even care that  urlLink air bags are designed for men , as long as there's a mirror so I can continually check the wave/frizz ratio of my hair. What if the paramedic cutting me out of my airbag is totally cute?  Actually,  urlLink Boost Mobile  hopes that their new  urlLink i285 mirror phone  will appeal to youths of both sexes so young metros shouldn't feel embarassed about using the i285 to touch up their  urlLink man makeup .  If you want a mirror on your phone, you don't need the i285 or the ultra-femme   urlLink Samsung T500 , you can make your own. See, here's my Treo, after its girly makeover:     I don't remember exactly where I got those stick-on mirrors, but  urlLink Strapya  is a great online source for cell phone charms, keitai(phone straps), and mirrors, direct from Japan, where they really know how to  urlLink dress up a phone . Strapya has tons of  urlLink sticker mirrors for your phone . I also have my eye on the  urlLink good luck charms  and  urlLink scented straps . There's even curry flavor. I want one of everything, that site makes me crazy. I'm placing an order today, would love to see pictures if anyone else orders something.  Hey, did you know that Shakespeare never wrote "Vanity, thy name is woman"? The line in Hamlet is actually  urlLink "Frailty, thy name is woman" . Thank goodness for those airbags.

         urlLink Dungeons & Dragons  has come out with a new campaign setting called  urlLink Eberron . Set in an area which is still suffering from the effects of a devastating war, Eberron stays true to the world of the Dungeons & Dragons we know and love while creating a new style for the campaign which mixes traditional medieval with a bit of a sci-fi twist. Airships, lightning rails, and warforged beings similar to robots exist, but instead of being powered by electricity, they are controlled by magical means. Four new player character races - changelings, the children of dopplegangers and humans with shapeshifting powers , warforged, golems who have souls created during the war, Kalashtar who share their soul with dream plane exiles, and shifters (yay, that's going to be me) who take on the form of different creatures and beings instead of staying in one form - have been added to the game.   urlLink Eberron Campaign Setting  along with  urlLink Shadows of the Last War  are the books that come out in June, while  urlLink Sharn: City of Towers   and  urlLink Whispers of the Vampire's Blade  will follow the release of those books. Eberron miniatures are also set to come out, including  urlLink Giants of legend  and other sets. A series of Eberron novels by  urlLink Matt Forbeck  and  urlLink Keith Baker  should appear on shelves, not to mention the adventures created by Keith Baker which will show up  urlLink Dungeon  magazine. D&D online - set in Eberron - is being developed by  urlLink Turbine  and will allow players from all over to play together in this new world.  More products are sure to come out to add on to the Eberron explosion over time, bringing more new opportunities and chances to explore places in the world of D&D which no one has yet set foot in.

        Every year  urlLink Business Week  sponsors the IDEA (Industrial Design Excellence Awards) and this year's winners are the usual mix of kooky and stunning, with the iPod Mini taking home a Gold statuette as expected.  Pictured above is the Aliph Jawbone which lets you talk in noisy spots like restaurants by suppressing surrounding noise. It was created for military use but will also help you become a marginally less rude diner by letting you speak, not shout, while your tablemates try hard not to listen.    My favorite winner is the Knirps XI, the world's smallest umbrella, which can resist winds up to 50 MPH and is extra fast-drying.

       urlLink     Just yesterday I was looking at games at  urlLink EB  with my niece and I wondered how many women were playing console games instead of just  urlLink online games , like the ones from AOL.  I don't know the numbers on Xboxes and Playstations, but a study by the  urlLink Yankee Group  has found that  58% of mobile gamers are women.  However only 17% of women purchased games, while 29% of men did.   Make  urlLink Lady Sia  happy, go pick up a  urlLink Gameboy Advance .  Read the  urlLink Yankee Group Press Release .

        Good news for people who like to skip a shower now and then: You can still smell like you're clean, just by using  urlLink Philosophy's Soap and Water Set .    soap + water = pure grace. we say this because pure grace has an unbelievably clean, fresh scent. women who are drawn to pure soap and water notes will love this fragrance. pure grace is ultra-fresh and crisp with universal appeal. pure grace is best described as infinitely clean, a light veil of transparent freshness for that just stepped out of the shower feeling all day long.   The set includes shower gel (so it's soap scented soap) and a bottle of  urlLink Pure Grace Fragrance Spray . I got to sample this and it's very authentically soapy. So much so you'll wonder if you skimped on the rinse cycle during your last shower. I'm always searching for the perfect non-perfumey perfume, and even those much hyped  urlLink Clean Perfumes  are a little heavy to me.   Did you know that scent is the most evocative of the senses?  urlLink Smell is powerful . So if you spritz on a little Pure Grace, no one will really notice that your hair is sopped with grease and you have soot stains on your face.

      The US Court of Appeals in Massachusetts has just ruled that email does not qualify for the same privacy protection as telephone calls or snail mail. The now-defunct online book company, Interloc, argued that since customers' email was temporarily stored on Interloc computers, they had every right to examine and print them if they chose. Frighteningly, the court agreed. Why was Interloc reading emails? It turns out that they were intercepting emails to and from Amazon.com, probably to ascertain what new marketing tactics Amazon was using. Fat lot of good it did them in the end, but that's little solace, considering that this means employers, ISPs, and any company at all can now argue that your emails were examined because they were passing through their servers.

         In my overloaded cupboards, I have about fifty thermoses that I purchased for my kid over the course of her fourteen years of squeamish life, each with the hope of it being the one that would keep her food hot until lunchtime.  All failed, until one day, I happened upon this  urlLink Zojirushi  two-compartment thermal lunch jar in a Japanese department store in New Jersey called  Matsua .  My daughter reported that her veggie chicken nuggets stayed warm for the first time.     Purusing the  urlLink Zojirushi website , I came upon an energy-saving thermal cooking pot, which is essentially an extension of the thermal lunch jar idea.  You bring your stew or whatever to boil on the stove using the inner pan, and then insert the whole thing into an outer container and vacuum-seal it to finish cooking.  Perfect for potluck picnics and tailgate parties.

Maybe instead of encouraging less commercial hobbies, you can just switch to  Barcode Kitties . These equally adorable cats have nothing to hide. Nothing covert here, their whiskers are  barcodes ! Launched in Japan, by the  urlLink Seikodo Corporation , you'll be seeing their UPC tattooed faces all over our shores and stores very soon.

I'm sad because when I put him all together, he didn't look much different except I added the giant melanoma and the brow piercings. Some people actually got  urlLink pretty creative .  I got my Pontiki at a B.Dalton Bookstore, but I think they'll be every-freaking-where very soon.

        If you're over the age of about eighteen, you probably have fond memories of your first cassette Walkman. It might not even have been a Sony, but you still called it a Walkman and played those mixed tapes that you spent hours carefully compiling yet still had those annoying clicks between the songs. Sigh... I miss those days. I even still call any portable audio player a Walkman. Shoot me, I'm old.  The Walkman brand is turning 25, and to celebrate, Sony is launching a brand new hard-disk music player, the  urlLink Network Walkman NW-HD1 . Sony is aiming hard at Apple and the mighty iPod/iTunes combination with a whole series of new portable media players as well as the new Sony Connect online music store.     Looks like the competition is going to be fierce. The 20GB Walkman NW-HD1 is smaller than the 20GB iPod, and the battery life is 30 hours, 22 hours longer than the iPod's. It will also be less expensive, with Sony promising a price under $400. The bad news? The new Walkman will only support Sony's annoying ATRAC format.  The Walkman HD-1 will be available in the US in mid-August.   Check out the  urlLink Sony Connect Store .

       urlLink    Avon's new lipstick,  urlLink My Lip Miracle , comes out in September and will mark the debut of  urlLink Intuitive Technology , a series of products that purportedly custom adjust according to each user's body chemistry and coloring. This claim is nothing new, since I've seen products that promise this since I started buying  urlLink Mood Matcher lipstick  in 5th grade and it looked identically grotesquely fuschia on everyone who put it on.  My Lip Miracle contains  urlLink hydrophobic pigments  which make me think this lipstick will be afraid to go swimming but probably just means the stain will last through a drink or two as will most greasy, I mean "moisturizing" lipsticks.  Other Intuitive Technology products on the pipeline include 10-day nail enamels, All-day eyeshadows, lipliners, and mascaras. Avon traditionally offers half price specials when new products launch, check out  urlLink Avon  in September.

         If there's one thing I cannot live without on a long plane trip or when staying at a friend's house who has not provided me with a cable-equipped TV in my bedroom, it's entertainment. Call me high maintenance, but when  urlLink Archos  first debuted the Pocket Video Recorder, my prayers were answered. My life with  urlLink Archos  began with the purchase of a AV340 recorder. Despite it's bulkiness and lack of refinement, I was in a new world. Not only was I able to store vast volumes of music MP3s to take with me, I could also bring along my favorite TV shows and movies! When I was bored with listening to  urlLink Annie Lennox , I could switch to a rerun of  urlLink Friends ! Soon to follow were lesser quality or lesser featured players, like the  urlLink RCA Lyra .  Now comes the next generation recorder from  urlLink Archos , the AV400 series. The improvements over the AV300 series are like a wish list come true: smaller form factor, removable battery, drop-in connection through a cradle, scheduling, availability in larger capacity models, external speaker, and (on certain models) a larger screen. So, if you're not already on the bandwagon and you, too, are the fidgety-when-flying type, take a closer look. This may just be your saving grace!

         Though I might like to think of myself as on top of every last technological innovation, I must have missed this one.  And, what a miss!  A couple of weeks ago, I was fortunate enough to get a house-sitting assingment for a friend, who is so very kind enough to pamper her friends by outfitting her guest suite with a Tempur-Pedic foam mattress from  urlLink Brookstone .  I have to say, I have not had a more restful night's sleep in the last decade.    Developed for NASA, "the visco-elastic foam in Tempur-Pedic mattresses molds itself to your body shape to evenly distribute weight and eliminate pressure points, which has been proven to improve sleep and increase the level of deep sleep, so you wake up more alert, refreshed and better rested."  Sleep is such a personal thing, it only seems logical that a mattress that customizes itself to the individual would be so perfect.  And it was!  Stop by your local  urlLink Brookstone  for a test nap!

        While anyone who would steal a purse would think nothing of ripping it open to get at your valuables, you could potentially stop pick-pockets with this  urlLink Anti-theft handbag . It uses a fingerprint scanner to protect your bag from unauthorized access.  It's just a prototype now, designed by art student Louise Wilson, but I'm betting we'll see this thing on the market within a year's time. The  urlLink Sony Micro Vault with Fingerprint Access  USB storage device is very small and relatively inexpensive ($120 for 128mb) so the technology is already commercially viable. I also hope Louise will consider licensing her idea to  urlLink Coach .

        Showing victims of severe burns a 3D world full of happy snowmen and penguins sounds a little cruel to me, but in a study which had healthy participants viewing either SnowWorld or a black cross while their feet were pulsed with hot lamps to simulate burn pain, the SnowWorld people were shown to have a 50-97% reduction of stress in the pain centers of their brains. Of course seeing an ominous black cross on a screen through a VR helmet while having your feet burned is not the same as lying in a hospital bed, but the researchers are hopeful that they're onto a drug-free method of pain control.  Incidentally, the SnowWorld screenshots look remarkably similar to an old RealNetworks screensaver called Snowglobes:     Next time I have a migraine, I'll turn it on and put my face real close to the screen, which I hope is something like virtual reality.  Read more from the  urlLink Washington Post  and the  urlLink Human Interface Technology Lab  at Univ. of Wash.  Download a free copy of  urlLink Real Snowglobes 3D  (warning: this is an old screensaver that may not work well with newer systems or graphics cards.)

        Paris Hilton reportedly sought solace from the Kabbalah Centre the minute after breaking up with Nick Carter. If a  urlLink famously moronic celeb  like Paris has embraced a  urlLink pseudo religion , it's a sure sign that the  urlLink lowest depths of the celebrity fringe  are about to join in, soon to be followed by the unfabulous general public.  It may already be too late to look like you're one of  urlLink Queen Esther's  crowd but you can attempt it with a genuine  urlLink Kabbalah Red String . These are issued? blessed? by the Kabbalah Centre and are supposed to protect you from the evil eye. If you're afraid someone will ask you exactly what the Kabbalah is, you can take a crash course by reading  urlLink Essential Kabbalah .  After you've been enlightened, you can let your skin in on  urlLink The Secret  with  urlLink ALIVE Facial Scrub , made with pure Kabbalah water.

        If you like your games fierce and nauseatingly grisly (yeah me too), then this must be an exciting day for you, the eve of the coming of  urlLink Doom 3 .    urlLink Doom 3 reviewers  have said the game has almost cinema-quality graphics which makes for a frighteningly realistic gaming experience. Cool! All that spewing blood comes at a price that's higher than normal, $55.   If you're not planning on going to Best Buy at  urlLink midnight , and you don't want to spend the next two weeks downloading a  urlLink pirated copy , the best price I've found is at  urlLink eCost . They've got it for $46 and shipping is free. I've had great luck with eCost and delivery has always been speedy. The  urlLink XBox version  is there for $43.99.

        Other companies, like  urlLink BenQ  have already released necklace-style pendant mp3 players but the  urlLink Sony AD-EMPZ  claims to be the smallest of them all. It weighs less than half an ounce, but has 256mb of storage and offers 8 hours of playback with the rechargeable battery.     The  urlLink Aiwa Flush  looks like a teeny tiny charm of a portable CD player but it has 256mb of memory and can play for up to 11 hours with a regular AAA battery.

        If you want the very best Sony has to offer, and you don't mind paying a lot and waiting a long  time for it, then the  urlLink Qualia  line is for you. These  urlLink Sony Qualia MDR-EXQ1 earphones  have gold plating and "high-energy neodymium magnets" for top of the line looks and sound. They're also a relative bargain at $269, considering that the  urlLink Qualia 016 mini digi-cam  is a whopping $5000.
