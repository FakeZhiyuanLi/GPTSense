You probably don't think the world can change for you and don't want to spend too much effort trying to force it.  Your outlook on life is brighter than most people's. You like the idea of influencing things for the better and find hope in situations where others might give up.

      rick and i got into YET another fight last night about the state of our realtionship, where it is going what we want from one another and all that jazz. Per usual i had to drag everything he was feeling out of him, because god forbid he actually trust me enough to tell how he really feels about something. He claims its the way he grew up which frankly just sucks because how the hell am i supposed to undo 19 years of an inablity to communicate effectively with another person. sometime i don't think he realizes that he never tells me what he wants. like for example the topic of last night was what happens when i leave in may after graduating. He never comes right out and says that he doesnt want me to leave him, its always that when i say i am leaving he feels sick to his stomache or whatever. Which is fine because i suppose that is some sorta reaction but once and a while it would be nice to know exactly what he is thinking. See he is lucky, if i am feeling anything he gets a detailed account of whatever it is i  am feeling. If he makes me happy i tell him, if he pisses me off you better believe he knows he did. I am a yeller i will admit, which when dealing with someone who has a hard time expressing emotions is never really constructive. He feels like i am yelling at him (which vocally i am) but really its a way to get a reaction, something, anything ,that shows me he does care about it.  he told me last night that he loved the year we spent together last year and that that is what he wants ... i was so relieved to hear him say that , most of the time i feel like am pushing too hard on him but i also know that if i don't fight for us most of the time he won't, or can't. We fell in love to young. But there is nothing that can be done about that now. I have lived with him and love him enough now to know that i will be with him forever and always. he told me last night that dating experts have said that if a couple can stay together for 30 months and not get sick of one another then they can make it work for the long haul. Rick and I just passed the 15 month mark bring us half way. And i NEVER get sick  of him, but i get frustrated because i feel like he is waiting for some mircle to happen when he finally gets out of school. I want to walk through life with him, not sit on the sideline waiting for everything to fall perfectly in place. Nothing is ever perfect and sometimes, all though perfection is a prefectly good dream, the reality of the situation is that perfection is not for this world. So whether it is the money we dont have or the obsticles we have to face i want to work through it all together not wait while he figured it all out. Waiting in this situation is wasting precious time, why if we are great together should we not be willing to make the sarcrafices to make everything we want happen. The thing about dreams are everyone can have them, its what you do to attain them that makes the difference.  I don't understand a person who would stand in the way of rick and i being together. people who claim to love him should be so happy he found someone to live his life out with. I love him i like no oneelse does that much i know. I want the best for him, I want to give him everything i have and to have him let me into his world knowing that i will love him till my dying day without hesitation or reservation. I want his love and his trust and to be the one he comes home to at night. I want to come home to him at night and when i lay down to go to sleep i want him to be the last person i see and i want to have my prayer thanking god for him to be the last thing i do each night. I don't want to live my life alone and only be half of a pair. I need him as much as i hope and know he needs me. We are so different in our approach to everything but if we each conceed a little bit there is no reason that we can't get exactly what we want in life. but i want to do it all together as a team not wait around for everything we have no control over to fall into place.  the moral of today rant : time is precious so instead of the fighting and the animosity why not try to make moves towards the life you want.

      Jesus Christ I am tired of working in DS @ salve. Im bored and Im tired and all i do is read cnn.com and check away messages all day. Two more weeks of this and I am going to be soooooo ready to go home. Just think on days that i am not working at shaws i will outside in the sun laying by the pool and sleeping all day long. Gearing up for what one can only assume will be a fantasic school year. please take time to note the sarcasm.  im just so tired of feeling like i am wasting time or letting time pass me by you know? when  is it all  going to fall in place, and you know what i am talking about, you too are wondering when the life you wake up to in the morning will be our own and not some warped variation of. When  you finally get up in the morning and think: Holy Christ i am finally doing what i love, living with who i love and building our life together.   i have more to say but im so fucking tired i just can't write anymore.more to follow

        I  hate  the way you're always right. I  hate  it when you lie. I  hate  it when you make me laugh;  Even worse when you make me  cry.          I hate it when you're not around                        And the fact that you  didn't call ,                        But mostly I hate the way I don't hate you;                        Not even close;                        Not even a little bit;                        Not even at all.        ~ 10 things i hate about you      good days never last as long as you hope they will . no one is perfect and the sooner i realize that and get over myself and my retarted fantasy world i like to think that i live in the better it will be in the end.  So here is to disappointment and being forced to live with it.      ps i broke my fucking nail tonight because of you.                             Time to say Goodbye                               Quando sono solo   sogno all�orizzonte   e mancan le parole,   Si lo so che non c�è luce   in una        stanza quando manca il sole,    se non ci sei tu con me, con me.   Su le finestre   mostra a tutti        il mio cuore   the hai acceso,   chiudi dentro me   la luce che   hai incontrato per strada.     Time to say goodbye.   Paesi che non ho mai   veduto e vissuto con te,   adesso si li vivrò,   Con        te partirò   su navi per mari   che, io lo so,   no, no, non esistono più.   It�s time to say goodbye�     Quando sei lontana   sogno all�orizzonte   e mancan le parole,   e io sì lo so   che sei con        me,   tu mia luna tu sei qui con me,   mio sole tu sei qui con me,   con me, con me, con me.    Time        to say goodbye.   Paesi che non ho mai    veduto e vissuto con te,    adesso si li vivrò.   Con te        partirò   su navi per mari   che, io lo so,   no, no, non esistono più,    con te io li rivivrò.    Con te partirò   su navi per mari   che, io lo so,   no, no, non esistono più,    con te io li rivivrò.    Con te partirò.   Io con te.

      so here is the new look. Its called Tequilla! WOHOO!   Ok so paula ( a lady in my office) just had the most amazing pictures of somewhere near 2nd beach called "hanging rock". *Sigh* sometimes I forget that I live in one of the most beautiful places on this coast. Now all I can think about is buying film and takeing 100's of scenery shots of newport. I have wanted to do that all along but I just never have the time or the energy. Plus Rick is working all the time and without his knowledge of the area I wouldn't even know where to go.   Have you ever gotten that feeling when you get inspired by something, that you might just explode if you don't do it right then. Most of my life is like that  here. there is all this beauty and inspiration and i want to capture it all. But instead i am forced to be tied to a desk all day writing in a weblog instead of experiencing life! ARGH! so not fair. Its a terrible thought but i wish that we worked all day as children instead of wasting time watching tv and playing with doll/trucks, playing "house" or "superheros". All that wasted time, i long for that time back and hate that i may not get it until i am 65 and retired.    thought provoking:   I've seen the rain fall down, And wash away a town, I've seen strong hearts easily broken, Why do some things survive? While others live and die? How can someone let their love go unspoken?  I couldn't stand to see us end up that way, Just another tragedy. Every night I promise another day...  Whatever it takes, I will be there, By your side baby anywhere, When you're lost and alone, I'll bring you home, I will come through, for you, Whatever it takes, Whatever you need, Whatever comes down between you and me, When the road gets rough, You've gotta trust, I will come through, for you, Whatever it takes.              ~Belinda Carlisle               Whatever it Takes

      Having a bit of an indifferent day. Not really in a bad mood though definately not my best. Really tired, of my summer, of my life at times, mostly just literally physically tired.  I'm going home tomorrow night till thurs. night .... spending sometime with the mumma as her surgery was postponed for a while. We are planning (after I get my linsence renewed) to shop. I need to get rick a bday gift so she said she would come along to help out. She has great taste so i am excited.  I have to go to work tonight, that is always a great time (NOT). Need to talk to Steve tonight and see what is up with him. He got some news that is making him reevaluate a bit, I want to make sure he has someone neutral to talk to. Sometimes I think that he thinks the talking is only for him, but it has helped me to build more connections here and reasons that it will be ok to stay here with rick forever.   At least I have good friends and a loving boyfriend to take care of me when I am not with my family. Its more then most people have and lately I am realizing that i am extremely lucky to have love in my life. Most of the time I take it for granted but lately, and i don't really know what sparked it , but i find myself thanking God alot before I go to sleep at night. And sometime when i am with Rick I thank Him right there. Its hard to imagine going through life alone. In face I can't even. I would be lost without him and he really is my best friend. Not my soulmate but I have never believed that we are ment to be with people that complete us totally, if we were all completed no one would need eachother anymore. I need Rick and I like it that way because I know that he will always be there when i need him. I think a soulmate is a spritual best friend, the kind you spend a life time look ing for and then in the end realize you never really needed your soulmate at all. you just need to love someone and that is always enough in the end.  I have never been a big God person, but this thought just hit me: what if God (or your variation of) is the soulmate we spend a lifetime looking for? What if we miss so much in our life because we are looking and looking for someone we only get to meet in death?! I think that might be my answer to my ultimate question in life : what does God want from you. My answer might just be .... to love rick fully and unconditionally while i am here and then to accept that in my end God will be my salvation and reward for a life spent doing the easiest thing in the world, loving the one person who knows me and loves me for me,totally and completely me.  are you throwing up yet? maybe you just couldn't even stand to read the end of this post. if that is the case i am sorry my new found revalations bothered you so, but remember this, you don't have to understand it completely or accept it as your answer to anything, I just needed to write it down and get it out of my head.   "The greatest thing you'll ever know, is just to love and be loved in return." ~Moulin Rouge

      YAY! a good lunch break today... rick came by my office with a 6" sub just the way i like it and then he brought me to cold stones for an ice cream. My baby is the best!!  In other news ... work at salve ends the 13th of august leaving me homeless in newport until the 7th of September. It would appear that I am moving home durning this time but will be commuting the 1.5 hours to work three shifts a week at shaws.... booo hisss.... on the upper swing to that story i will then have a chance to see and visit with people back home before the head off to law school or i am on my way back to salve.  I have the night off from work tonight which is always good ... I am out of work at 4 and then having the night to myself is always a good end to my midweek slump. I believe i am headed home with rick and mums tracker on friday to then switch off and bring rosie (ideally fixed and raring to going) back to NPT with me that night.  Awe-inspring Lyrics of the Day:  "I remember when I met you All the stars were hanging in mid-air In these moments - nothing mattered But the way you caught me in your stare We were walking - we were talking We were laughing about the state of our lives How our fates brought us together As the moon was rising in your eyes  On and on the night was falling Deep down inside us On and on a light was shining right through" ~Belinda Carlisle "La Luna"

      HAHAH!! As you may have already read my boss tried to pull a fast one and use parts of a project I was working on to create something "more exciting"  TO BAD HE GOT RIPPED APART by the dude the project is for. He should have stuck with what i wanted and had in the first place and it would have saved him ALOT of embarassment getting shot down by Yarnall!  The moral of this story is ... if i did it ... i did it right so leave it the fuck alone KEN!

      Journeys  We go through life a step at a time Traveling at our own pace Some move fast, while others move slow, but we all climb Looking for just a moment of God's grace.  Moving from place to place The task is to find out who you are Each of us look for our own space Even if it means we wish on a star.  We look to the Heavens in search of an answer The question i am sure you know well, they are of life, death and meaning Why does SHE have to have cancer? Or even, why aren't YOU there intervening?  Its from our journeys we learn to love Its from our journeys we learn to look to the above.

      YEAH! I FINALLY GOT A DAMN CELL PHONE THAT WORKS!!!   yap! went to verizon all by my big girl self and bought be a pretty fanastic cell phone. Feels good to do something that important all on my own. 1-774-991-1509  I took this afternoon off from work to punish my boss ... though he thinks its cause i didn't feel well, but really its because for 2 weeks now i have been slaving over a brochure for Dr Yarnall and i am working relly hard on it cause i am trying to kiss a little ass. Ken decides yesterday that he going to take a look at the files and "make a few changes" a few changes turns into he is going to do a version of his own and let yarnall choose the one he likes .... flash forward to today when yarnall comes in and ken only gives him his copy ...yarnall doesn't even know mine exists. i fucking hate that i did all that work and all he did was just move some text and cut a couple of pictures. I will be damned if that is how people in the real work operate.  Talked to mom night ... let her now i was thinking and praying for her ... she is doing ok but is getting anxious about the next surgery. I hope and pray to god everynight to ease her pain and worry. She is my inspiration though i must say, no matter what is going on with her ... she always wants to talk about me and whats up with me and rick and how are we doing .... i love her and i hope to god she is fine after this surgery ...  i need sleep ... talk to ya'll in the morning ;-)

      Today is crappy and rainy and i am feeling shitty. not enough sleep in the last two days... or could it be too much sleep. This weekend was mad fun and i love being in NPT. Home was good while Rick and i were there though i always feel like i am deserting my mother. with her being sick again and now not working for the summer i know she gets lonely around the house. im going home for her surgery in a couple of weeks and the last think i do before going to bed each night is ask god for her to have a full and well lived life... not the one i know that she is experiencing now .... pain and doubt and worry. I want so badly for the cancer that is slowing inhabiting her body to be just a dream, a nightmare if you will. i want her at my graduation and at my wedding and to see my children. If i had it my way parents would never be sick or tired or lonely ... and there would always be enough time in the day to call them just because. Of course that is not real life.  My head is killing me and even the sound of my fingers on my keypad it deafening... it doesn't help that a certain roommate of mine continually is clicking a hair thingy. It sounds like she is clipping fingernails/toe nails in her bed. of course she is not so i am pissy cause each click slams into my head like a truck to a phone pole. Today is a depressed days, a day that i have usually when i have enough time to stop and think about all the other shit that happens when you don't even realize it . today is a day to forget and try never to relive again. Today is pain... physically and emotional and its a day i  hate .

      What a load of crap. I worked till 11pm last night and not my normal working either. was like running around from 5-10 and catching up 10-11. I was exhusted. I had to be up at 7:20 this morning and so the fucking alarm goes off and i am so damn tired i don't even know its mine, poor miranda has to yell "KATIE!!". Smile about this man ..|..|.. 8 am is for crazy people that jog or do yoga not for people that are made to come to work and sit at a desk working on mind-numbing activites. The plus is I am only at this job till 1pm... a nice solid 5 hours ... then i get to go back to hell from 2:45-8:30 (9 if I HAVE to). Going to see Fahrenheit 9/11 tonight ...should be really interesting, im not usually the political message kinda of movie goer but i hear it well done and its going to make history so i figure i better get behind it before i get left behind. im sure ill have something worth reading about after having saw that, so sit tight ... there is more to come.

      jesus christ! what a night at work... we cut an ass load of hours tonight and of course took it up the other end cause of it. I hate those self scan machines even more then i hate my boss... its sick. Testicular Fortitude Day will now be celebrated on July 1st in Rhode Island, not recognized by the government of course but I bet there will be a cult like following. The day is in celebration of when other people you know and work with dick you over and then come around and rub it in your face. Generally it the liars and the slackers and the people not of high moral understanding that will be the perps on this holiday.   for those who care i got a pen that lights up blue .... yay. my life and world all make sense now. Im so tired that all the wit of the evening has been sucked out of my brain. Ill write tomorrow , i promise.
