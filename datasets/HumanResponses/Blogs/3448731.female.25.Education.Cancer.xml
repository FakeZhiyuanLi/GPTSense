      Ok, this is my first time here... maybe should read other people's blogs... see what kind of witty, crazy things they're saying.  but it doesn't really matter, i think i just need a place to ramble.  Regurgitate some thought.  someplace to play out my melodrama.  trying v. hard not to edit or polish this too much either.  so, no eloquence... not even purposeful raw though.  yep, just rambles... and at least for a couple days, until i become otherwise distracted, i'm going to write down every thing i eat.  seems like a good thing to monitor, right?  yeah, i mean, i'm not one of those super anxious, gotta be on a diet all the time kinds of girls (ha! it's all a lie, anyone who types something out like that is, to some degree, a liar...).  But my thighs are really bothering me today... hey, you asked.  Well, you didn't, but if this is just too whiny and boring to read, than just stop.  Just wait until I get going about my mother.  And sweet god, when I start complaining about my job... run away- quickly. What was I talking about.  Ahh, rambling.  Good for the soul.  so, yeah, so far it's been a bowl of cereal.  Half Golden Grahams, and half honey graham Life.  The latter being the far superior cereal... you should try some.  Anyway, that with FF milk.  Not too bad right...    cereal: 300 calories            3 g fat           91% calcium... awesome!           2 g fiber   milk:   70 calories           0 g fat           23% calcium  hmmm, in ww land... that's already 7 points.  But good news is that I'm at 114% calcium for the day...? that can't be right.  You're not supposed to get more than 150% in a day, I thought it was dangerous.  But, uhh, I mean, if I wasn't paying attention, I'd blow right throught that.  And all I've had is a bowl of cereal?  Maybe my golden graham numbers are wrong.  I don't know, but I'm currently sipping a grande skinny latte... which should seal the deal for my calcium... probably put me into the danger zone.  let's see shall we?    latte:  160 calories            0 g fat            0 g fiber                      45% calcium. so that works out to be 3 points.  And now I'm at... uh oh, 159% of my calcium for the day.  No more dairy for me... except, well... I'll jsut have to make a concerted effort not to have any more dairy, I guess. huh...  Points total up to 10 so far.  So I've got 14 left for the day.  Hmm, sounds like i'm going to be hungry.  I mean, this is not looking good, friends.  Should have had a smaller bowl of cereal... I guess. lame.  that's all I got right now... let's post this baby. ~~~~~~~~~  maybe I should have this a second post.  whatever.  Further reading has revealed that I should have a target of 1300 to 1400 calories per day... you know, to stay slim.... err, get slim.  So, wha?! ugh, I'm at 530 right now, and it's only 10:30 a.m.  .  It's okay, I suppose, it's just day one, an evaluation day, if you will.  ~~~~~~~~~~  Ok, for all of you keeping track... false alarm on the almost ODing on calcium today.  The official numbers for cereal are as follows    cereal  240 calories            2 g fat            2 g fiber            20% calium (!)  oooh, crap... I'm only at 88%, and that's a misnomer, b/c women are suppose to have 150% DV of calium... somebody doesn't understand the fundamental of percentages. Anyway, I had two veggie tacos, no dairy (b/c I was affair I'd explode and die or something) sub gauc... good fat they tell, and it was v. much.  So, umm, any guess on that caloric intake.  Yeah, me either... I'll break it down like this...    black beans   360 calories                  26 g fiber... I don't know about this one.  dottisweightlosszone, can you be trusted???                  2.5 g fat                  0 calcium    gauc   110 calories          9 g fat          4 g fiber          0 calcium      I have no idea about the tortillas... lets just hope I compensated somewhere.  so i'm like at 1000 calories for the day, and my head hurts from doing all this math.  I think I'm having a pretty lo-cal dinner, but lower than 400 calories, I'd be surprised.  Dammit!!!!!  J/k :) it's all good.  No stress... I might have to have some frozen yogurt to make my calcium anyway :).    It was a horrible day at all... I can make some changes.  And I'm going to get a pedometer, see how much I'm NOT moving throughout the day.  oooh, I might have to start charting stuff!  graphs, yay!
