       Wednesday, July 28th 2004 11:45 p.m.    &nbsp;      &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there a difference between being independant and strong-willed? I think sometimes my independance is too much for my parents to take in. I love to be on my own and trying new things. Im not the type of person who is scared of change, I dont look for the easy way out every time, and I hate being protected from things. I love a challenge, but not too challenging.    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the other side is being strong-willed. Thats almost just like being stubborn, isnt it? Well, then again, its more of like what's in your heart and ur&nbsp;morals. I know like when someone asks me if i want to drink I know in my heart that its the wrong thing to do, and frankly, i wouldnt even like to if I could. Dispite the peer pressure i get, i dont budge. Yea, thats also stubborn. But in a good way!   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So back to the topic of my parents hating my independance. I've been into this since like 6th grade. And i think its really hard for them- since my lil brother, Alex, is totally incapable of doing most things i could do when i was his age, b/c i was looking for a way to break free from under my parent's wing. And they think i shouldn't, and they try to make me stay there still. I try to do too much without them. I include them as little as possible. Yea, thats bad, i should have a better relationship with my parents, but what can i say? I'm a middle child! And, they just hate that!!    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it ok to be independent at this age? I should hope so. If Im old enough to drive, old enough to have a job.....im old enough to be independant!! ha! Well, then is it ok to be too strong-willed? I dont think so. I think people need to lighten up a bit, but stay true to themselves. Its just that i know what i want, and if i dont get it when i want and how i want......i get a lil mad. Thats a bad case of strong-willed-ness! But hey,im just, what they call "High Maintenance!" hee, hee   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yea, in conclusion ......well there is no conclusion, but i'd like some feedback on this one, girls! i love you and i know im already going to miss you! MUAH!!!   &nbsp;&nbsp; im pretty dog tired, and not supposed to be online rights abouts now! So this is stef, signing off!    &nbsp;   &nbsp;  " Oh, seems like i can finally rest my head on somthing real. I like the way that feels. And oh, as if you know me better than i ever knew myself. I love how you can tell, with the pieces, pieces, pieces of me."   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Aslee Simpson     &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;

       Wednesday, July 28th 2004, 12:49 am    &nbsp;  So, what are u supposed to do, when someone is mad at you, but they dont tell you- you hear it from another person? I mean do you confront them about it and be like "hey, so why are you mad at me?", or "i hope we are on the same grounds here", or whatever you say when&nbsp;you confront someone when they're mad at you.Or do you wait for them to confront YOU? Cuz, then you know that they are manning up to it. OR should you let it just blow over, and forget about it?   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think that letting it "blow over", is like saying "im too scared to talk to you".IT really really annoys me! i mean i would talk to the soemone I was mad at, rather than tell someone else or keep it in. Cuz then one day after keepin all your anger in, youre going to burst and its not going to be pretty! Wow! My opinion though. GRudges suck.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, ill admit, i do keep grudges sometimes. Its mostly againts my parents. I find them the hardest people to forgive in my life. Its prolly cuz they are my family, my parents, and for them to do something to hurt me and not care, i just go nuts. But im not real big on that. I'll get over it within a day.    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But still, i dont see how anyone could just say they're mad at someone and not tell the person, especially, if its someone that you are well aquainted with, or on a team with. Cuz then you ruin half of the relationship. AH!   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the real question is: Blow over, or Man up?    &nbsp;   &nbsp;  "i dont mind spending every day. out on the corner in the pouring rain o i. look for the girl with the broken smile. ask her if shed like to stay a while, and she will be loved. she will be loved."   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Maroon Five    &nbsp;   &nbsp;  This is Stephanie Signing off    &nbsp;

       Saturday, August 15th 2004, 11:21 pm         Not quite sure what to talk about tonite. But i just realize what a selfish world this is. Just got done talking to a Sr. guy, and boy is he one of "THOSE" people. He thinks that life is just a big game of acceptance. And he really pitties himself for not really having many friends, or friends that arent anymore. It all started with talking about how excited i am with school. And he, apparently is not, because he is "seen and not heard". Yea, whatever thats supposed to mean. Then he goes on to say "I have a side i do not wish to share with people. For if i am anything other than what people expect or want, there are reprocutions." Yea, whatever thats supposed to mean. haha! I told him that life's just better when you dont analyze things and think everything is a conspiracy, but just be yourself and dont give a toot about what people think, because you know that they want to be themselves too, and you let them. He thinks its all about acceptance! BOOOOOO......no man.       HE wants to be accepted. HE wants to have a voice. HE decided to stay out of sight since no one listens to him. See, if we all just look to our own needs and wants.......then no one is really getting what they truly desire. There is no one to fulfill, or satisfy those needs and wants. People want this, and that and that, and yet arent willing to give the slightest thing back. What do we give back, anyway? Its not even ours! Its really God's! He can choose whether we really DO need that eightyith pair of Monolo's or not!  Not up to us! Plus, if no one gave back anything, no service, no money, no clothing, no hardwork or effort.......what would the world look like, huh? Yea pretty shabby.  It just all makes sense to have a servant's heart in our society and life today.       In other words....."Look not unto your own needs, but to the needs of others" -(some passage from el Biblio!)Ok well.....thats all i gotta say! QUIT BEIN SO DARN SELFISH! Dont just think about yourself all the time, yea be yourself, but dont consider yourself better than others. ok THE END      muah, besos !   STEPonME

      Thursday, August 12th 2004, 11:04 pm What is your identity?  What do I want people to think of when my name pops up in their head? What do i want people to be saying about me when i walk down the halls @ school? What is it that i want them to identify me with? Those are questions that have been running through my mind since youth group last night. Its not that im not sure what i stand for, its just that people probably dont see it. Though if they are around me, its easy to tell. I Just want people to see me for what i am, and who can can be.  Its like here i come down the hallway-Stephanie Foreman-Christian, fun, likeable, cute, involved, smart and in shape! I mean those are all good things for someone tothink about me, not that i usualy should care what ppl think about me, but i need to find an ID in Christ. Thats what Rob was talking about last night. Im not quite sure what he meant by that, but what i got out of it was this: live life by giving glory to God every moment you get, change the way you live your life and find yourself in CHrist. Its hard.  Tonight i had the grand opportunity to take a 45 min. walk with my dog. I had to get out of my house! Everything was going crazy, mom yelling at dad, dad trying to make dinner happen, all of us sitting at the table anxious to leave. Family dinners here, are not the typical, in my house, lets just say. Crazy loud, argueing. Grrrr and then my mom wouldnt let me go anywhere tonite. So i wanted to get out and think and let some steam off! I ended up after half an hour, on the bench in the lot, singing praise songs to God.  I know he can lift my burden off my chest. And he did. NO matter what, always praise him, everything bad that happens is not his fault, and if it is, then he has a purpose for that, so praise him for putting you in that situation. Thats my opinion.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Change of subject! Dating in highschool-stupid, or practical? Stupid!!!-you have all your years of highschool to explore your potential, and  you dont need a guy to hold that back. Plus, have fun with guys and be friends with them all so that you can pick out good qualities when you decide to date in college! Theres too many broken hearts happening in Highschool, and its a waste of energy-most likely you arent going to marry your highschool sweetheart. On the other side......  Practical....-You need to have practice on dating and relationships before you actually get married. Its good to date so that you know how to treat a person of the opposite gender in an intimate situation.  And that way you can pick out what you want in  your future spouse, or what you dont want! It all makes sense, doesnt it?  No, not to me, at least. I mostly believe that HS dating is worthless. But hanging with guys is just as fun! Leading guys on is terrible too. Lets put an end to that one too.  Its getting old.  Ya cant have 'em all! THough as fun as it is, we're hurting someone's feelings, yes guys have feelings. (well most do, at least, lol).......... ;)  Ok well i think thats all ihave to say tonight, and ill be off to never never land in no time! XOXOXOXO Steponme

       Wednesday, August 11th 2004, 1:45 pm         I watched The Little Black Book last night, and i would not recommend it to anyone. Not a very good plot line, kinda drags on too long, and just really stupid. But Brittany Murphy was great, i love her. She's a great actress actually. But what i noticed in the movie is that she was repeatedly trying to "prepare herself for life", for what she thought was destiny. But was just herself trying to find the answer. She wanted her life a certain way, and seeked for it too hard.      I guess i can compare to "Stacey Holt" in that matter.  I feel like I've been planning my life out too much. Trying to prepare for my destiny, that i dont really have control over.  It all just seems silly to me, however, to spend your life preparing for a lifetime. When its really a waste of your time. You dont know if thats what God wants you to do, and most likely if it isnt his plan, then your life was practicly a failure, and its not going to work out how you want it to. God has his plans for us. We just need to listen and be aware that his goals for us in life, are our goals in life. His plan for us, needs to be our plan.       Thats probably my biggest independance area. I love going off and exploring the world and trying to figure out who i want to be, what i want to do, where i want to go! Its ok to do things in life that are fun, that you want to do. But if it determines your destiny , your future, i believe you need some counciling from above. Just think about that. Before you sign those papers to go to Stanford, you make sure thats where He wants you to go as well.            "This is your life, are you who u want to be. This is your life, is it everything you dreamed it would be, when the world was young......."                       -Switchfoot

          Saturday, August 7th 2004, 11:54 p.m.                       Just recently i got home from my long trip away from home all the way in Texas. Suprisingly, they dont all wear cowboy hats and scream YEEHAW at the top of their lungs. But, anywho. IT took about 21 hours to get back home. Let me tell you! It was the ride I will never forget. Well, yea maybe ill forget it, but who cares. I got to sleep this time. People were nice enough to let me have a seat to myself. And yes, Lacey got her own seat too, lol.  I kept on waking up, and going back to sleep, and waking up and going back to sleep. But i think i was waking up because a part of my body had fallen asleep or, i had a huge kink in my neck.                Well no matter that, I would like to take the time to think about my new friends. Or NOT friends.  Some would call them companions, or aquaintences. I just dont have a name for them.  SO me and Lacey would hang out with Lynzee, and these dudes Mike, Andy and Adam. Now on the bus home we didnt get Lynz.  But it was funny to watch people interact with eachother.  Like we could so tell when this girl liked Adam. We watched her and just kinda let her do her thang. But then there was this ...... meanie on the back of the bus. I wanted to talk to my Mikey back there and so i sat by him. This was at night on the way home and she turned around to me and said "Steph i dont know if you guys have a rule about guys sitting next to girls on the bus. But we do. And its not allowed. At all" I was acting all oblivious and said "o no, we just have the rule that when  you go to sleep, you have to be by the same sex." SO imoved up to my normal seat.            So yes, of course earlier that next morning on the bus, she is sitting right next to ANdy. And Mike has another girl by him too. No im not jealous, I just think that biyatch needed to back off.  And perhaps not be such a hypocrite. THese people tho, i mean the girl that snapped on me, and her friend, were giving us (lacey and me) bad looks the whole time. What did i ever do? I thought that we were supposed to be Christians here. Well apparently, some kinda over looked that characteristic while hopping on the bus that night. So, in a sense, they were the tabasco sauce of the Sandwiches.           Let's talk abotu the Jelly! The sweet ones! Lynzee, aw i miss her! typical  blondie, cheerleader, cute and talkative! We'd call her like every night to see if she could come hang out, but our leaders wouldnt let us leave the hotel at night to see them. And the boys-ANdy, Mike (the cute one), Adam (also the cute one, but great hair! and ears, lol Lacey) and Jake.  I hope i can keep those friendships. O yea. John Dennis is hilarious. Hes kinda a goob when you first meet him, but then turns out hes not like a nerd.  He just doesnt know how to interact with hot girls! haha! Oh yea and Jeff is just a great guy. Well that wraps up the jelly!          O yea, i m the Bread. Probably since i like bread so much and carbs. Isnt it bread that gives you those dimples aka cellulite in your butt and thighs? hmm well i dno dude. just wondering. And if you have any information on how to get rid of it, please post me a message ASAP! haha you know i want it!But anyways, i love the sandwiches over all. Im tired. Woah, abrupt ending.                  "Dragon days. And the fire's hot! Like a desert needs water, i need you a lot. Dragon days. Need to be saved. Dragon days, and day it drags on, and on......."                      - A. Keys Dragon Days

        Sunday, August 1st 2004, 9:47 p.m.             So, i think I've come to a conclusion. I AM OFFICIALY HOME SICK!   I have been away from my bed, my food, my dog, my clothes, my house, my everything for about 4 days and I am just half way through.  Its just really the fact that Im not around my familar settings, and I cant just do whatever i want when i want and eat anything i please. How will i survive college!!!!! Oh, please thats in like 2 years.        But still, i really miss my friends especialy. I called Norris last night, and I didnt get to talk to Allie or Natalie. I miss them sooo soo soo much! The people here i love, but its not the same. I cant relate to them as well as i can with my girls. YOu know how that is. By the way, im in TX now for my dance nationals! teehee!        I dont know if its like a hight maintenance thing, or just a me thing, but ive been getting real homesick lately.  Imiss my things! The stuff im familar with. Waaaaa!!! But i need to get over my "child like behavior" and learn to use this experience away from home as a test to my um....able-ness to be away from home! ha! Its getting really bad though. I hate eating junk food, and fast food, and thats all we eat on the go. No salads, no veggies, no fresh fruit, and no healthy snacks! And then we dont even get enough sleep while we're here. Its like we're on a Military shedule or soemthing, but   its also good self discipline for me. I need to practice waking up early for school. UGH, i wont mention that word for a while.        heehee, although im really excited for school to start,man, again im a total nerd when it comes to that stuff. I've already gotten some of my supplies~o yea norris! ok babes well my eyes are shuttin way to soon! I love yall!         "If i had wings i would fly, cuz you're all that i need, you are. Cuz youre all that i believe, and the one that created me, Jesus, because of you. IM FREE!!!!!!"                                     Boogie&amp;Lemonade
