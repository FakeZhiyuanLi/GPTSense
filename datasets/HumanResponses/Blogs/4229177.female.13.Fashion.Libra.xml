        To All Kelly Clarkson Fans !          Kelly Clarkson          As we all know, kelly clarkson's debut album 'thankful' was a huge success ! Her first single was a 'moment like this' which hit the top 10 in 2002. She then continued with her next single 'before your love' in the same year. In 2003, she published three singles, 'the trouble with love', 'Low' and 'Miss independent. Her latest song 'breakaway' which is the soundtrack of Princess Diaries 2, became a hit every where because of the originality of the song.           Biography          Unless you've been living under a rock lately, you've heard of Kelly Clarkson--even if you've never tuned into the phenomenally popular TV talent show, American Idol, that made her an overnight sensation. In fact, Clarkson is such a megastar that her debut single, the double A-side release "Before Your Love"/"A Moment Like This," set a Billboard Hot 100 chart record previously held by the Beatles, for the biggest leap to number one, when it skyrocketed from number 52 to the top spot in October 2002. Although Clarkson's humble, aw-shucks attitude while competing on Idol made her seem an unlikely diva, the 20-year-old's success is as much the result of hard work as it is good luck. While growing up in the small Texas town of Burleson--where she sang in her school choir--Clarkson dreamed of superstardom, and like many aspiring singers, she actually moved to Hollywood to pursue that dream shortly after graduating from high school. Things got off to a good start when she hooked up with industry veteran Gerry Goffin to cut some demos, but for the most part, her stint in L.A. consisted of one setback after another: Goffin became ill, her apartment burned down, and after fruitlessly shopping her demo CD to record labels, the only paying showbiz opportunity that came her way was a non-speaking bit part on an episode of Sabrina The Teenage Witch. So Clarkson returned to Burleson, disappointed and drained, and took a job as a cocktail waitress. However, Clarkson hadn't completely relinquished her diva dream, and so, upon the insistence of her best friend, she attended an open-call audition for a new Fox TV show titled American Idol: The Search For a Superstar. Out of the 10,000-plus hopefuls who auditioned nationwide, she became one of the show's 10 finalists, and soon she was back in L.A.--although this time around, she was living in a fantasy Hollywood Hills mansion with the nine other Idol contestants. Needless to say, her second stay in L.A. was more successful, as Clarkson suddenly went from complete unknown to America's sweetheart, thanks to Fox. Although the prototype on which American Idol was based, Pop Idol, had already been a huge hit in the United Kingdom--propelling both grand-prize winner Will Young and runner-up Gareth Gates to the top of the British pop chats--no one was prepared for the American version's even more enormous Stateside success. Ratings and call-in votes for the program grew by the millions each week, and Clarkson knocked out the competition episode by episode, winning over both the viewing/voting public and sourpuss judges Simon Cowell and Randy Jackson with her bubbly, girl-next-door charm and solid performances of such staples as Aretha Franklins's "Natural Woman" (a song ironically co-written by her old mentor, Gerry Goffin, although she didn't realize this at the time) and the Badfinger/Nilsson/Mariah Carey ballad "Without You." Eventually, it all came down to Clarkson and mop-topped heartthrob Justin Guarini, who both sang two ballads written especially for the show, "Before Your Love" and "A Moment Like This," on the final night of the competition. Millions of viewers voted, and the following evening--September 4, 2002--Clarkson was officially declared the show's winner on live national TV, with 58 percent of the votes. Clarkson won a $1 million contract with RCA Records (who rush-released her first single two weeks later) and quickly hit the road with the other Idol finalists, including Guarini, on a sold-out stadium tour. She has since started work on a musical movie titled From Justin To Kelly, co-starring Guarini (with whom she has been linked romantically, though she denies such rumors), and on her debut album with a virtual army of big-name producers and songwriters, including Diane Warren (Celine Dion, Michael Bolton), Desmond Child (Cher, Bon Jovi), and Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis (Mariah Carey, Janet Jackson). Since the American Idol craze really had more to do with the competition itself (and perhaps with salty-tongued judge Simon Cowell) than with any one contestant, it remains to be seen if Clarkson will end up the answer to a Trivial Pursuit question or if she will enjoy a legitimate, lasting recording career. Regardless, her triumph over flashier, sexier, and/or thinner Idol contestants (Guarini, Nikki McKibbin, Christina Christian, Tamyra Gray, Ryan Starr, et al), simply because she had the best voice, is a heartening turn of events in this Britney Spears-dominated pop world. Perhaps record companies will take notice of the public's decision, and instead of wanting to sign the next Britney, they'll sign the next Kelly. And that's not such a bad thing.

       The Trouble With Love Is   Love can be a many splendored thing Can’t deny the joy it brings A dozen roses, diamond rings Dreams for sale and fairy tales It’ll make you hear a symphony And you just want the world to see But like a drug that makes you blind It’ll fool ya every time  The trouble with love is It can tear you up inside Make your heart believe a lie It’s stronger than your pride The trouble with love is It doesn’t care how fast you fall And you can’t refuse the call See you’ve got no say at all Now I was once a fool it’s true I played the game by all the rules But now my world’s a deeper blue I’m sadder but I’m wiser too I swore I’d never love again I swore my heart would never mend Said love wasn’t worth the pain But then I hear it call my name  Chorus  Every time I turn around I think I’ve got it all figured out My heart keep callin’ And I keep on fallin’ Over and over again The sad story always ends the same Me standin’ in the pourin’ rain It seems no matter what I do It tears my heart in two  Chorus     Miss Independent   Miss independent Miss self sufficient Miss keep your distance Miss unafraid Miss out my way Miss don’t let a man interfere, no Miss on her own Miss almost grown Miss never let a man help her off her throne So, by keeping her heart protected She’d never ever feel rejected Little miss apprehensiveI said ooo, she fell in love  What is this feeling taking over Thinking no one could open the door Surprise it’s time to feel what’s real What happened to Miss independent No longer need to be defensive Goodbye old you when love is true  Miss guarded heart Miss play it smart Miss if you want to use that line you better not start, no But she miscalculated She didn’t want to end up jaded And this Miss decided not to miss out on true love So, by changing her misconceptions She went in a new direction And found inside she felt a connection She fell in love  Chorus  When Miss independent walked away No time for love that came her way She looked in the mirror and thought today What happened to Miss no longer afraid It took some time for her to see How beautiful love could truly be No more talk of why can’t that be meI’m so glad I finally see…  Chorus     Low   Everybody’s talking But they don’t say a thing They look at me with sad eyes But I don’t want their sympathy It’s cool you didn’t want me Sometimes you can’t go back By why’d you have to go And make a mess like that Well I just have say before I let go  Have you ever been low Have you ever had a friend that let you down so When the truth came out Were you the last to know Were you left out in the cold ‘Cause what you did was low  No I don’t need your number There’s nothing left to say ‘Cept I never thought it’d Hurt this much to be saved My friends are outside waiting I’ve gotta go  Chorus  I walk out of this darkness With no sense of regret And I go with a clear conscience We both know that you can’t say that This to show for all the time I loved you so  Chorus     Some Kind Of Miracle   Prayed for an angel To come in the night And shine some sweet light on me Found only strangers Then you came to me Just when I’d given up, you gave me love My world was tumbling down You turned it around baby  You, you’re some kind of miracle You are, you’re a miracle to me  Sweet revelation That look in your eyes Your touch in the night I find the sweetest salvation In your arms baby Warm as the morning sun, your tender love Came and just lifted me up Look what you’ve done baby  Chorus  You brought joy to my heart I found love in your arms See what you’ve done to me You set my soul so free You came and you gave me the love that I need You, you’re some kind of miracle You are, you’re a miracle, a miracle to me Baby you are, a miracle to me     Whatís Up Lonely    PBlue, I’m getting kinda close to youLike a shadow I can’t loseHey, you’ve been hangin’ with me every dayNow you’re gettin’ in my wayI know you understand meBut don’t ya think that maybe it’s time to move onWhat’s up lonelySeems you’re my onlyFriend who wants to share my painTell me heartacheWhat’s it gonna takeFor you to leave me alone todayJust when I think that you’re goneYou’re in the mirror lookin’ back at meSo what’s up lonelySometimes, I wish you weren’t by my sideCan’t you find another shoulder, cause II wanna leave this broken heart behindWe been wastin’ too much timeFind someone else to rain onI’m really getting’ tired of singin’ this sad songChorusDon’t wanna give you a reasonTo hang around anymoreYou won’t be hurting my feelingsIf you find another broken heart you can lean on    Just Missed The Train  Roll over baby, the time has cometo make a little bit more roomI've hung around you, it's getting toughI think I'm gonna break down soonI remember, crying in the park, it was getting darkSuddenly I looked upYou were my skySo go on andSleep darlingWhy don't you pretend we were just a dreamIt's cool babyIt doesn't matter anywayI'm so sorryWe got to the station a little too lateIt's such a shameWe just missed the trainBe quiet angel, don't make a soundSave it for a rainy dayOh can't you see me, I'm such a messtrying hard to find my wayDo you remember, wasting all that time, we were feeling fineThough we couldn't walk a lineWe were alrightSo go on andSleep darlingWhy don't you pretend we were just a dreamIt's cool babyIt doesn't matter anywayI'm so sorryWe got to the station a little too lateIt's such a shameWe just missed the trainOh, why'd that train just pass us byDidn't anyone seeWe were stuck at the lightOr we would've made it on timeSo sleep darlingWhy don't you pretend we were just a dreamIt's cool babyIt doesn't matter anywayI'm so sorryWe got to the station a little too lateIt's such a shameWe just missed the train    Beautiful Disaster  He drowns in his dreamsAn exquisite extreme I knowHe's a damned as he seemsMore Heaven than a heart could holdAnd if I tried to save himMy whole world could cave inJust ain't rightJust ain't rightOh and I don't knowI don't know what he's afterBut he's so beautifulSuch a beautiful disasterIf I could hold on Through the tears and the laughterWould it be beautifulOr just a beautiful disasterHe's magic and mythAs strong as what I believeA tragedy withMore damage than a soul should seeAnd do I try to change himSo hard not to blame himHold on tightHold on tightChorusI'm longing for love and the logicalBut he's only happy hystericalI'm waiting for some kind of miracleWaiting so longHe's soft to the touchBut frayed at the ends he breaksHe's never enoughAnd still he's more than I can take (Chorus)    You Thought Wrong  I see how you're tryin' to weaselYour way in and boy I know howYou maneuver with yourYour confusion You tell me that I'm your onlyAnd how bad that you want meThen why are you so shadyIf I'm supposed to be your ladyWhy should I believe anything you say And how could you shame me that wayTell me where, where'd you get the nerveTo even think I'd do you could play me forYou thought we didn't knowYou thought we were in the darkBut boy your cover's blown'Cause we both know now, oh noYou thought you had us both At your beckon callBut now who's the jokeAnd look who's laughing nowNow you're trying to use usAgainst one another but it won't work I see right through your game boyAnd I know exactly where the blame fallsYou, you try to deny all your actionsFor once in your life be a real manAt least give me the proper respect of the truthI already know you did itWhy should I believe anything you sayAnd how could you treat me that wayWhere'd you get the nerve to even think that you You could play me boyChorusNow I see right through you babyYou try to tell me you want me Can't you just get it through your thick head'Cause I have seen this game before andNow I'm showing you the door soShut your mouth I'm night tryin' to hear your lies againSorry you couldn't be a better man (Chorus)     Thankful  You know my soulYou know everything about me there’s to knowYou know my heartHow to make me stop and how to make me goYou should knowI love everything about youDon’t you knowThat I’m thankfulFor the blessings and the lessonsThat I’ve learned with you by my sideThat I’m thankfulFor the love that youKeep bringing in my lifeIn my lifeYou know my thoughtsBefore I open up my mouth and try to speakYou know my dreamsMust be listening when I’m talking in my sleepI hope you knowI love having you around meDon’t you knowChorusFor the lessons that, that I’ve learnedFrom the troubles I’ve knownFor the heartache and painThrown in my wayWhen I didn’t think that I could go on but you made me feel strongWith you I am never aloneChorus    Anytime  Anytime you feelLike you just can't hold onJust hold on to my loveI'll help you be strong But you're so afraid to loseAnd baby I can't reach your heartI can't face this world it's keeping us apartAnd I could be the one to show youEverything you missed beforeJust hold on now'Cause I could be the one to give you moreAnytime you need a love baby I'm on your sideJust let me be the one that can make it all rightAnytime you need a love baby you're in my heartI could make it all rightI look into your eyes And I feel it coming through I can't help but want you more than I want toSo baby take our love your wayCast them all on meThat's all I ever wanted was just to make you seeBut I could be the one to heal youAll that you've been searching forJust hold on to my loveAnd baby let me give you moreChorusNow there's no way outAnd I can't help the way I feel'Cause baby I'm on fireAnd I'll be waiting right hereYou know our love isn't real Chorus    A Moment Like This  What if I told you it was all meant to beWould you believe me, would you believeIt’s almost that feelin’ we met beforeSo tell me that you don’t think I’m crazyWhen I tell you love has come here and nowA moment like thisSome people wait a lifetimeFor a moment like this Some people search forever For that one special kiss Oh I can’t believe it’s happening to meSome people wait a lifetimeFor a moment like thisEverything changes but beauty remainsSome things so tender I can’t explainWell I may be dreamin’ but until I awakeCan we make this dream last forever And I’ll try to show the love we share ChorusCould this be the greatest love of allI wanna know that you will catch me when I fallSo let me tell you thisSome people wait a lifetimeFor a moment like thisChorus    Before Your Love  I wonder how I ever Made it through a dayHow did I settle for aWorld in shades of greyWhen you go in circlesAll the scenery looks the sameAnd you don’t know whyThen I looked into your eyesWhere the road stretched outIn front of meAnd I realizedI never lived before your loveI never felt before your touchI never needed anyoneTo make me feel aliveBut then againI wasn’t really livingI never lived before your loveI wanted more than Just an ordinary lifeAll of my dreamsSeemed like castles in the skyI stand before you And my heart is in Your handsAnd I don’t know howI survived without your kiss‘Cause you’ve given meA reason to existChorusAnd I don’t know whyWhy the sun decides to shineBut you breathed your love into meJust in timeChorus
