      Ok. It's my first time doin this. Today is the 2nd day of my poly orientation. It should be fun, but being sick, spoiled everything and really pissed me off. Every morning, my throats feels better, but after a day of hard coughing, my throats feels horrible plus terrible plus cucumber. I really need the cooling effects of the cucumbers now. But heck. i hate cucumbers.

      I Don't Understand  I don't understand, I don't know why, Why you did this to me, Why you wanted to leave. I can't understand, Cuz it hurts like hell, To think you felt so terrible, And couldn't even tell. I won't understand, It was just so wrong, You didn't have to leave me, As though you don't belong. Now I feel so empty, And everywhere I turn, There's always something missing, For you I always yearn. And it hurts me very much That you didn't say goodbye, Just left one day without me, Left me here to cry. I don't understand Why you felt things were that bad, That you just gave up everything You ever knew or had. I'm sorry I didn't know, I'm sorry I wasn't there, Now I'm here all alone, You left, it's just not fair. I can't understand, How could you leave When I need you so much? In return, you make me cry. I won't understand I'll never make it without you, It will never be okay...  Dedicated to someone veryspecial,  I miss you...

      if you ask me, 'would you take a bullet for me?' i would say&nbsp;i would, because i'd rather die than live without you. i love you a lot.. do you know how i feel.. without you, life becomes so dull.. without you, eating ice cream is like eating warm milk. without you, the beach is dark and cold.. without you, sweets taste bitter. without you, sleep doesn't come. without you, tv programmes are nothing.. without you, what are computer games. without you, i am NOTHING..  and now, i am without you.. i am nothing.. and i feel, the "purest of pain"

      *Have You Ever// Brandy Have you ever loved somebody so much It makes you cry Have you ever needed something so bad  You can't sleep at night Have you ever tried to find the words But they don't come out right Have you ever? Have you ever? Have you ever been in love? Been in love so bad You'd do anything to make them understand Have you ever had someone  Steal your heart away? You'd give anything  To make them feel the same? Have you ever searched for words  To get you in their heart? But you don't know what to say And you don't know where to start Have you ever found the one You've dreamed of all your life? Do just about anything  To look into their eyes Have you finally found the one &nbsp;You've given your heart to? Only to find that one  Won't give their heart to you? Have you ever closed your eyes and Dreamed that they were there? And all you can do is wait For the day when they will care

      Tell Laura I Love Her  ( Ray Peterson ) Laura and Tommy were lovers He wanted to give her everything Flowers, presents,But most of all, a wedding ring He saw a sign for a stock car race A thousand dollar prize it read He couldn't get Laura on the phone So to her mother, Tommy said Tell Laura I love her Tell Laura I need her Tell Laura I may be late I've something to do, that cannot wait He drove his car to the racing grounds He was the youngest driver there The crowed roared as they started the race Around the track they drove at a deadly pace No one knows what happened that day Or how his car overturned in flames But as they pulled him from the twisted wreck With his dying breath, they heard him say Tell Laura I love her Tell Laura I need her Tell Laura not to cry My love for her will never die Now in the chapel where Laura prays  For her poor Tommy, who passed away It was just for Laura he lived and died Alone in the chapel she can hear him cry Tell Laura I love her Tell Laura I need her Tell Laura not to cry My love for her will never die Tell Laura I love her Tell Laura I need her Tell Laura not to cry My love for her will never die  (my love for esther will never die. i love you. if need be, i'll wait till your o's is over. just tell me you love me and ask me to wait. i'll wait. i mean it.)  &nbsp;

" hey.. what attitude is this.. then you might as well quit poly" ya. she is right. what attitude is this. why am i making myself sad, when i dun even know if someone cares? she didn't even bother to reply when i say i love her. am i saying it too much? then i dun say. it's already 8.47. and i have no sms from her. no call. should i worry? is she with alvin? haha. i think i am getting crazy. or she wants me to sms her, just to just ignored? i dunno what she wants. i dun even know if she wants to break up with me or not. or, if her mum really dun wan us to be together. or she wants to break with me to be with someone else. i'll never know. and even if it's true, she won't tell me. worry worry worry. am i becoming a worry rat? haiz.

      today.. sunday.. i went to cut my hair.. but that's not impt.. what's impt is that somehow, my gf told me that seeing my blog has made her "wake up" she said that she had been "half asleep" last time.. why was she half asleep? was she tired of me? tired of our relationship? or tired loving me, caring for me? i know that i have not been a good bf to her.. but i am always trying.. trying to improve.. trying to please her.. i just hope that she will give me time.. &nbsp; today, the way she talk to me, her tone.. and everything, really seems that she suddenly finds that i am a more interesting person to talk to.. but as she said, it seems that we're in a whole new relationship.. and if she's happy, i am happy... her mood... is so impt to me.. she is impt to me.. and i trust her.. although i am not happy that guy keeps msging her and doesn't get the fact that she is my gf, i have learnt to control myself.. she is my gf.. she has chosen me, according to her, 51 days ago, and i want her to choose me again, to stay by my side willingly, for us to support each other, to take care of each other.. &nbsp; i asked her today, if that guy msged her.. she said yes.. and he told her he had an ulcer.. why tell her you have an ulcer? can't you find another girl who is unattached? but i must control... it is hard.. but i must.. cos relationships are built on trust.. i trust her.. really i do... hope i am not just convincing myself, but the trust is really there... but heyy.. i trust her... but not the guys..

      Dun know what the hell is happening.. I know i asked her to tell that guy not to msg her that often.. but i thought about it.. if i tell her to say that, it will make him think i am a loser and scared that i will lose her to him.. guess what the guy say.. it is his right to msg my girl as much as he wants.. what cheek.. dun he know that she is my darling and that she is off limits?? And.. she told me.. she thinks i dun care for her as much.. i also dunno why she will think that way.. i know that i love her.. i trust her, and i know that she loves me too, even though lately, she haven been telling me how she feels, if she loves me, miss me.. or whatever.. &nbsp; Yesterday, i almost quarrelled with her, just because i didn't tell her that i went for soccer and made her worry.. when i came home, i kinda answered her rudely.. i didn't think of what she would be thinking.. later on, i regretted, and i called her... she just told her smth which i didn't catch.. and i hung up.. i was upset.. she didn't give me a chance to explain myself or apologise.. but in the end, it's all okay, and i am glad.. &nbsp; today, we went for a movie and to take photos.. spiderman 2.. suddenlt, it seems that i need to behave myself.. keep my hands to myself... like she isn't my gf.. but just a female friend.. and i cannot touch her.. every kiss, every hug.. nv lasted for more than half a min.. haiz.. is it that i think too much.. or is it that we're really drifting apart......... &nbsp; &nbsp;

      today.. smth happened to us.. alvin msged her this morning.. i am begining to hate him.. i am jealous.. haiz.. and when she told me she wanted to stop doin what what we have been doin.. i have no prob with that.. just that i was wondering why.. like izzit alvin got smth to do with it..  anyway, i went to get my soccer shoes today.. was priced at 68.. but i dunno why i got it at 58.. haha..  today, the first time i really began to have doubts about our relationship.. she wanted innocent love... i dunno if i can give her that.. and i thought maybe that guy could give her that.. something i cannot give her.. haiz.. stupid me..  but at the end of the day, i still love her, and she still loves me.. so it isn't that bad.. but i wonder.. did it make us closer... or pushed us apart.....

      True Feelings     Zaida I Torres  You probably can't relate To the way I feel But I know that this is fate And what I'm feeling is so real  This isn't lust This isn't just   Another game   Another name For hate, or for deceit But for my love and for my trust  You probably don't even care 'Bout what I'm trying to say My heart you wouldn't spare Not tomorrow, not today  I need you to understand That I'm stretching out my hand Waiting for you to take it Not for you to shake it  But for you to embrace it upon yours And make me feel so sure That you'll give me all your trust So that you and I can become- an US.

      OUR LOVE  a love so true and beautiful, a love so pure and rich, a love so strong and powerful, the love we have is everyone's wish;  the past two days i have pain in my heart, the past two days, a smile so strong, the past two days- scared we'll grow apart, the past two days felt like forever, so long;  scared to lose you is all that i am, scared to be without you, i look back on the day everything began, and realize everything is true;  not a dream, not a big lie, yet, i have tears in my eyes, tears that only you can dry, tears- because i realize;  the feelings i have i've never had before, the loving someone as i do, if i lose you i will feel it no more, 'cause the only reason i love... is "YOU!!"

      Today, I woke up late.. somehow, I cannot wake up.. maybe, it was because, I didn’t sleep well last night.. woke up a couple of times.. I had muscle ache on my calves… woke up to apply the muscle cream on my legs.. anyway, I thought I would be late for school today.. but, surprisingly, I wasn’t… there wasn’t any traffic jam and I got there on time..  Class today was boring… kena my pem 3 hour lesson… reporting his words again and again… anyway.. I smsed my darling a lot of times today.. however, I got only a few replies… and the replies often were not longer than a page.. somehow, I told her that I thinkone of the girls in my class isn’t as attractive that I think she was… her tone.. I gather that she was jealous and angry.. her tone told  me all that.. however, I dare not jump to any assumptions… after all, she’s right.. why was I looking at that girl in the first place? Stupid me… haiz..  My school today.. had this cca orientation thing.. I stayed back to look at the ccas… I took an interest in the soccer, ambassadorial team and the aikido club… on the way home, it stared raining.. when it reached the bus stop, it was drizzling.. so I took a run… I hugged my bag.. cos I didn’t wan my notes to get wet… my pants were too big… and, it sort of slipped… I pulled it up and continued running.. when I reached home, I took a shower.. whn I came out of the shower, darling was already home.. but I was reading some notes so I delayed calling her.. when I called her, I was talking bout the cca’s… I told her I wanted to join the soccer team.. immediately said no.. I was shocked.. I thought she would support me in whatever I do… and then the ambassadorial team.. she asked me what is it… I tried to explain… I really tried… but I couldn’t… then she smth… she said..  okay never mind… I’m not interested… I felt so sad.. haiz… feel so lost..

      This is for my darling, Esther..  Love is....  Love is... The warm bubbly feeling I get inside my stomach when I think of you  Love is... The way I wake up thinking of you and the way I go to sleep dreaming of you  Love is... The way you look deep into my eyes and then smile softly  Love is... The way you call me, "your baby" those two words make my heart beat faster  Love is... The way you comfort me when I'm down  Love is... The way a bad day can turn into good when I'm thinking of you  Love is... The way you smile... just that, can lighten my day  Love is... The way I feel when I'm around you, I'm protected from everything  Love is... The way you kiss me... the world stops just for those few minutes of pure pleasure  Love is... The way you hug me... so warm and gentle  Love is... The way I see other couples together and I'm wishing you were here with me  Love is... The way the tears fall when I know I'm not going to see you  But at least I know I have you and that you love me  ..and that's all that matters.

      i think i dunno what to say to her le.. dunno what is wrong with me.. i'm like, as she said, always asking, saying the same things.. so.. and.. every 3-4 mins or so, she'll be like typin so furiously away on her keyboard.. and, whatever i say, she won't be concentrating.. and.. okay.. i dunno if it is my fault or hers.. and.. i dunno why, she speaks, either too loudly, or too softly.. it is not that i dun pay attention.. it's like hard to hear and understand.. and when she has to repeat, she gets so pissed off... sounds as though talking to me is a chore.. i dunno.. as she said, i am a burden to her.. a needless burden.. i'm a person.. and to be another person's "needless burden", it is not good.. not good at all.. and i am wondering.. if i really should leave her alone.. for now at least.. i really miss her.. I MISS HER A LOT.. it's crazy.. i am crazy.. i dun even know if she feels the same way.. i dun even know if she cares for me.. i dun know.. all i know.. is that.. the way she speaks to me, is like i'm irritating.. i.. haiz.. life.. so many things happening to me.. now, my heart is racing.. always like that... sit down, feel like vomitting... stand up, see black dots in front of my eyes.. it's time.. heaven is calling me soon.. well.. we all have to go sometime don't you all think so.. early or late.. as long as you live life to the fullest.. did i? i think i did..

      is it over? i dunno. i said i loved her. and what did she say? "can you stop saying that? i dun wan to start hating you or find you irritating" so what can i say. she say i dun understand her. fine. i dun say that i know everything about her or that i know exactly how she feels. i try to. but i'm not her. i dunno what she really wants. and she doesn't tell me. i mean i try man i tried.. and.. i dunno if she really try to understand what i am goin thru.  when she said that, my eyes started to fill... but i know i can't cry. i mean not in the living room. not in front of my parents. not in front of my sis.. what else can i say but sorry.. and sorry i am.. for giving her pressure.. for saying i love her.. for telling her i miss her.. for letting her know that i really need her back at my side.. from now on, i will try.. really try to stop telling her how i feel.. even if it tear me up all the way.. i will just keep my damn mouth shut.. haiz..  i think it's a week since my headache started.. it's been here a week.. somethings wrong with me.. i can even trip when walking.. over my own legs!! that's like so amazing.. maybe it's the lack of sleep.. maybe it's cos i miss a certain someone too much.. maybe it's cos it's a sign that my legs are goin to give way.. maybe maybe maybe.. life's full of maybes... she gave me hope.. and she took that hope away.. she brought colour into my life.. and she also took it away.. in life.. if there's no hope.. there's nothing to live for.. now.. many questions.. why am i here.. if i am gone, who will miss me(i'm not thinking of suicide la).. and.. more and more.. it's so stupid.. i'm like a "bird that cannot fly" a person without hope.. nothing to live for.. haiz.. life is so depressing d you think..

      today.. test on business statistics.. i didn't study enough it seems.. it seems so easy to everyone else.. and i was struggling like... what's the word... drowning man? i dunno.. i msged her in class.. asking if the guy tells her he like her or he loves her.. she told me, that guy said love to her.. he said he loves her.. HE SAID HE LOVED HER god damn it.. and i am supposed to keep my cool.. trust her.. oh yeah.. i told her i love her.. yes.. i admit.. i may have said it too many times... but each time i say it, she just keep quiet.. and just now, she snapped.. she told me to stop it.. haiz.. as if i am a tape recorder and says it just over and over and over.. but it's not.. it's not... everytime i say it.. damn it.. with the bottom of my heart.. and.. i dun even know if she has already liked another guy, chosen another guy but just not with him physically or whatever.. but heck.. in a conversation, am i supposed to ask her, "hey esther, are you sure, are you lying to me" i can't.. it just seems wrong.. it is not as though i dun trust her.. but what she does.. is like damn hard for me to trust her.. to go to the staduim with i dunno how many guys... and.. say, "i goin to eat now, msg you later" and just hang up my call.. more than 2 hrs later.. it's 11pm for heaven's sake and you're not home?? come on.. dun you know i will be worried.. or you think that after you say "let's break" and i forget all about you.. it's impossible.. haiz... what i am doin.. i dunno if it will change what she thinks.. i dunno.... i really dun.. and it is tearing me apart.. really tearing me up.. from the inside.. bit by bit.. every day, i miss her... i've never missed anyone so much.. i thought that in school, when i am surrounded by ppl, i can do things, keep myself busy and quit thinking of her for a few minutes.. but eventually, i fall.. i crumble.. yes i am weak... WEAK.. ithought i would never beg, never grovel, for someone to love me.. but now, i am doin it for her.. and for her to tell me, "i dunno what i am feeling" haiz.. it just breaks my heart... everyday, i miss her.. and everyday, she sees the guy in school... i feel that i am losing..bit by bit.. but then again, have i already lost?  headache... 5th day and counting.. olympics coming on tonight.. i can't sleep... guess i'll be watching...

      i know smth now.. the girls are getting crazy.. i was assulted by two of my female classmates... pinch here pinch there.. touch here touch there.. creepy... on the bus home, there's this girl.. in school uniform.. sit next to me.. it's not like it's her last choice.. there was like probably 4 or 5 seats empty and she could have sat there... but no.. beside me she sat.. and every bump the bus went over, push her oh-so-slightly towards me.. she started to rub (i swear) her legs against mine... and it was so darn uncomfortable.. having to squeeze with her.. luckily, she went down soon enough.. my legs were starting to cramp.. and i was feeling so guilty... about sitting there and not standing up to leave when she first started.. my classmates, 2 of them... the girls.. were disturbing me, that i was flirting with the other girl... i was so upset.. i guess, deep down, i really love esther.. i cannot just forget about her.. every time, if i get close to a girl, i feel uncomfortable.. as if i did it, i would be able to face her.. haiz.. i really need her..  4 days.. headache for 4 consecutive days.. something wrong with me? brain cancer? tumour? scary.. hahaha.. i hope not la.. i am still young.. i have places to go and things to see...

      It was...  It was the day I met you... that I found the greatest treasure in my life.  It was that moment when your eyes met mine... that I understood what love meant.  It was when you held my hand... that I found strength to carry on through life.  It was when you hugged me tightly... that all of my burdens suddenly subsided.  It was when you pressed your lips against mine... that I tasted the sweetness of paradise.  It was that charming face... that inspired me to live for a better life each day.  It was those eyes, full of love so true... that paved away all the fears and the worries of my weary heart.  It was that simple smile... that took my breath away.  It was that laugh, lingering through my ears... for once I felt like a child again so free from the cruelty and harshness of reality.  It was that gentle voice... that made me smile in those times when I mostly felt I had to give up.  It was those loving words put into actions... that gave me the courage to hold on.  It was you.. It is you... And it will forever be you... that will make my life complete.

      If for me tomorrow shall never come, Then I wish for you to know All my secrets that lie inside For u, I'll let them go i'll tell you all my wishes, and dreams I wish to come true But if tomorrow never comes, I wish they'd happen to you If tomorrow i shall not wake up And my soul has disappeared I wish you the best of luck And I'll be watching u from up here I'll tell you all my feelings, about how u weren't just my friend About how I trust u with my life Forever in the end If tomorrow my eyes should not open, And I can no longer see your face Then I wish to leave as soon as possible So I can see u from this new place I'll unlock all the treasures in my heart, For u to only know But think how hard this will be For me to let u go If tomorrow I shall not awaken Then there's something I wish to do Tonight I'll whisper in your ear Softly, I love you

      I WANT TO KNOW WHY  I want to know why you left me like this put me in all this pain.  I want to know why you said, 'Hello' When you really meant, 'good-bye'.  I want to know why you turned your back to me, And all you did was make me cry.  I want to know why you said you loved me When all you did- was lie.  Look me in the eye and just tell me... *WHY*

      i have a feeling it's over.. ppl are telling me it's over.. but i refuse to admit it.. i still love her a lot.. doesn't have to be this way.. why? i have changed.. but where.. i can't see my own faults until someone points it out to me.. tell me.. am i not the sensitive guy anymore? "bad mistakes coming back to haunt me" by claiming that i am sensitive before.. sometimes, i dun get your hints.. tell me.. i wna to know..i too am frustrated when i dun understand you.. can you understand that? haiz...  every part of me screams for you.. i love you.. i need you.. maybe in your eyes, you've already given me a chance and i have blown it.. but pls.. i need time to change.. izzit cos we're both under immense pressure? i told you before.. if need be, i will wait for you.. till your o levels are over.. till a levels are over.. i know that you're the one for me.. someone.. there is no reason.. it's a feeling.. you're special... maybe not to everyone... but to me, and maybe some other guys, you are... i was so heart broken when you say that you love me less... and you dun enjoy being with me.. i try so hard to give you the best.. but.. it's not enough.. why? cos in your mind you've already made up your mind that you wan to leave me? cos you've someone by your side already? kicking me away so that you can be with that someone? i will never know.. you talk to him over the phone.. i dun even call any other girls for idle chat.. but you do.. haiz.. i am crying as i write this... but if i never say, would you know? no matter how sensitive a person is, somethings cannot be seen.. but then again, how would i know if you do read this.. or if you're already forgotten about this blog that was create out of our love.............. haiz.. i love you esther.. always will.. always shall..

      Pictures  Pictures are all I have left of our life together... I wish we could have worked things out through this bad weather. But you found a break in the clouds where the light is shinning through And that light is happiness with someone fresh and new. I listen to your heart and see it on your face... That I am no longer part of your space. I envy and am jealousof this man you see Because there will be new pictures,.. but they won't be of me.
