      Mood:   It's a beautiful day today!  They are making something in the home ec. room that seems to involve boiling strawberries and it smells sooooo good!!  Jam, I think.  I move on Sunday.  Sooo troublesome.  めんどうくせ　なああ！ I'm pretty much packed but I'm going to be living at my old apartment till the 1st so I'll be living outta a bag till Tuesday.    I'm going to go see Troy today though.  Apparently it's three hours.  mmm  golden greek Orlando.  They really picked a great cast I think.  I have an enkai on Monday so it's going to be a busy, busy time for the next few days.

      Mood: sad and a little  upset.     urlLink I got to this page  because it was written on a buddys shirt in the Penny Arcade comic today.  Totally random thing to do really.  Then I clicked on the birds and the bees story, which is what the link goes to directly.  I read the whole thing, all the time thinking it must be a kind of satire or SOME kind of joke.  No such luck.  I'm sure the author would say that letting our children think being gay is O.K. is not a topic to joke about.   Sometimes, over here, when Sonia sees something on the news about America that shows something with a Bush view on it, she says she's kinda embarrassed to be American at that moment.   I'm not christian, but I am human, and this man makes me embarrassed for the human race.  It's a book, just because it's a very OLD book written when it was very common for scholars to take hallucinogens does not make it unquestionable.  That's pointless logic though because it's the type of thing that a person has to accept to believe and the people who would benefit from it the most are unacceptable to it.  It's a tough thing living on this planet with so many different people.  Each one seems to think that it's not enough to hold an opinion. They feel that that convincing someone else will justify their stance more.  It would be so nice if people would have the faith in themselves to hold their opinions and truly not care what others think.  So many people say that they are that way, but if they are then why are they trying to change my thinking?  It's not just about holding your own under fire, its about not firing on others as well.     I was thinking though, like that kids in the comic; people have to get their ideas from somewhere.  They are socially constructed.  Plus, once they have them, i would be folly to have them set in stone.  New ideas should be reviewed and judged on their own merits.  Unfortuatly, most new ideas get judged on whether or not they will suposrt that person's existing ideas, which is quite the same as having them set in stone.   I'm just trying to live in this world.  I'm not smarter than many, and no, your probably not more or less intelligent than me by any great extent.  Don't quote IQs at me, IQ isn't realism, or emotional sense. So many, many people who think that their particular education and personality makes them smarter. Everyone of those people will ignore a statement like that as well, maybe they don't think I'm intelligent enough to criticize them, they who KNOW what's right.  Just like the man behind that page. If you could live in someone else's head for a bit, I bet you'd be surprised to find out they're NOT beneath you.  They are a smart and reasoning human being with reasons for everything. If you fail to recognize that, then how smart are you?   I believe that man is wrong, with all my heart. He can have his opinion, he can even believe that printing anti-gay pamphlets is the right thing to do.  I'll still sit her and be sad for him.  We can all only live as ourselves.

      Mood: slightly perplexed...  Now that I am on blogger I keep having to go to tripod to grab my little mood dudes.  It's kinda troublesome.  I can't just get rid of them though, they're too cute!  The things I do to keep you people amused.  OH, and get voting!  I want to put something up there.  Of course the people who have come to the site have probably voted so I suppose I should yell at the people who are lax in reading the best piece of literature on the internet today!

      Mood: FIGHTO!  I, in my ifinate wisdom, have found a way for you people to annoy, er I meeeeann, INFORM me without having to leave comments.  In the side bar is a most miraculous thing.  It's called a chatter box.  Im pretty sure you have to sign into your blogger.com account to leave messages and some of my fine viewers don't have said accounts. (shame on you for not wanting to share with us, what don't you love us anymore?)  THUS, this chatterthingie!  You won't even have to wait for new windows to pop up.  Mind you it could get confusing if a comment up there is for a post down the page quite a bit... but I think this is my best solution.  I even managed to put it into the html template all by myself!!  I bet my parents are proud!    Speaking of the woooonderful people who brought me into this world... (and sometimes say they can take me back out and make another one look just LIKE me, hehe) I bet you'd get a great kick out of reading my profile.  I outlined my meager and short life span there.  It amuses me that it is all true to an extent, the only exceptions are the cheese dip and the siblings thing.  Ahh, right down memory lane that profile is...  *skips away down aforementioned lane*

      Mood: a bit worried... I really dont know about this.  I feel kinda iffy about putting my blog up on a site that Im not hosting.  What if something crashes and I lose my posts?  Well, I suposed that's just as likely to happen to tripod.  Mainly the thing is that I can psot to this blog using my k-tai (cell phone).  Which also means I'll have no reason not to post, so really I'm just making more work for myself.  And the advertisement at the top isn't too bad.  The only real drawback here is that the formatting is a bit too hard for me.  I dont have to know anything about html to make my Tripod blog look cool.  I'm sure I'll figure something out without having to resort to other peoples stuff.  If Tami or Andre know how it would be great if you could help me out.

      Mood: It's getting hotter...    Today was a better day than yesterday.  Bob is here and it was a hella busy week. It could have been worse.  Im not that much further away from school, maybe 5 more minutes by bike.  It  will count later,  when it snows and I have to walk to school,  but even then it wont be bad. i hope everyones holding up well.   often think of the much worse things that some of you put up with, or had to deal with to get to where you are, or are worrying about for the future.  Makes me feel kinda petty and I try to be stronger because of you. Still working on internet @ home.  Ill have my email back soon.   PS...damn, the only thing keeping that picture from showing up was a bloddy = sign! grrr

      Mood: callitive   I have decided that the friends that I made in Halifax are very troublesome.  It's because of you friggers that the people here just don't seem as nice.  If it weren't for you guys I'd be used to everyone putting themselves first, worrying about their own problems and only talking about themselves all day.  BUT I'm not used to it, and you guys are to blame, poo heads.  o(^v^)o   My two Japanese books from Amazon arrived today!!  One on emotions and the other on onomatopoeia!  *kyo wa taiyou ga jirijiri!*  I will be paying much more attention to the sound effects in my mangas too!

      Mood: aghast   I was supposed to go to art class today and I ended up with an extra class RIGHT in the same period!  poo, I really wanted to go to art class today too.    Classes today were rather amusing though.  Except Roxy's class, it took effort not to walk out she's just so annoying.  If I pause she'll whisper my 'line' to me.  I often feel like this is some kinda production.  Now they've gone and added the 'I can do this so well that I can do YOUR part too!' type.  And, of course, she DOESN'T do it that well anyway, she's so caught up in making sure they learn the exact grammar that they aren't gaining any communication skills.  *sigh*  I wish everyone could teach like Hatanaka Sensei.    I feel like I'm getting a cold. I already have a sinus headache, yuck.  Naruto is on tonight.  So, that's one happy thing.  I don't have a light in that room yet though, it's one of the things I'm supposed to buy myself.  It's really annoying to be in the dark at night, but I know I'll have a hell of a time finding someone to take me to Eden, they're all either busy or adverse to doing favors for people that don't directly gratify them as well.  It's a tough situation since I don't want a car.  Asking people for drives is such a touchy thing.  It is a mistake to think you can solve any major problems just with potatoes.

      Mood: ok, but slightly annoyed   I have decided to do Kiba for the June 12th (13th?) con.  Since it's already done And I don't want to have to make a new coat in such a short time.  Kinda feeling the festivities from last night.  A little dehydrated, felt kinda nauseous after I had breakfast this morning.  Nothing huge.  The enkai was more fun than I thought it would be.  I'm still really home-sick though.  And the teacher that's like Roxanne apparently isn't any better at a party than at work.  The similarities are really uncanny.

      Mood: Sabaku Kyuu  At least it's not a Sabaku Taisou day.    Have an enkai today, that's a drinking party.  I really don't feel like going but I already told people not to pick me up for japanese class because of this.  So troublesome.  Maybe Ill get to sit by some talkative people.  It would not go over well in my current mood if I end up with people who don't talk to me.  Or the english teacher who seems to think I'm a lepper.  She's annoying.  She reminds me QUITE a lot of Roxanne.  Yes, you can see how well THAT must be going, ne?  Just today I found out she's hard of hearing, the poor dear.  She must not have heard me talking to her, sitting so far away at the desk beside hers and being the oh so quiet person you all know I am. ...  yeah.

      Mood: clean, of the squeaky variety...   Speaking of squeaks.  I was discussing animal sounds with one of the Japanese English teachers and mice in Japan go 'chu chu'.   On the topic of animals, there was a bug in my apartment when I came home yesterday.  A rather biggish type bug.  I couldn't squish it with a  urlLink shoe.   So I asked my neighbor to help.  I got the word wrong so at first she thought it was a cockroach and didn't know what to do, but then she saw it and it was a beetle so it was all good cause the kids keep them as pets and her son wanted it.  Thus I was saved.  Also you might be wondering where the birds and slugs part of the title comes in.  There was a slug in the lettuce that my land lady gave me when I went to her house.  Ugh.  I washed the lettuce, but I just couldn't bring myself to eat it after that.  I don't suppose you can really sterilize lettuce can you?  There were ants too, straight from nature that lettuce is.  This reminds me of the time I watched eXistenZ and I couldn't eat chicken for about a month.  No idea how long THIS will take...  And birds... well some of you might remember the little bird that was exploring my house the day after I moved in.  Some may not.  I was taking a nap and I heard scratching besides my head (cause this is Japan and we sleep on the floor) and when I turned I heard a bird take off and fly into the kitchen.  I never did actually SEE the bird in the house, only saw him a few minutes later when he was trying to find a way in the kitchen door.  Maybe to find out what that garganuan thing that scared him was...  Frigger must have been back the other day too, cause there's no other way that bird poop could get into my sink.  At least he had the decency to leave it in an easily cleaned place.  I'm animal bloody central lately.

      Mood: its raining   Well, It's going to be another busy week.  I really need to get my internet back up at home.  I have a primal NEED to check my email!!    On a stranger note.  I met some Chinese people yesterday.  Had a spot of tea with them.  One of them speaks rather good English.  Going to bike to Takayama with them some time.  Learned a bit of Chinese too!  Very fun!  I'm going to Tokyo next weekend, there many be a con involved so there may also be a Kiba and an Akamaru involved as well.  Do wish I had a barking one, but I don't at the moment.  I need to get out to the fabric store.   I have changed the text to black too, since I thought it was unnecessarily hard to read.

So now Im addicted to Ragnarok, If anyone wants to join me on there, Im trying to catch up to Tara-Lynns monsteriously leveled up character.    And its real late.  night night....

      Mood: meh   In Tokyo right now.  Did many things yesterday, in uncomfortable and impractical but good looking shoes.  Went to a convention today, Akamaru and I.  It was fun, but much smaller than I thought it was going to be.  There were other Kiba's and even a Shino!  Fun!  I missed going to the Jump Shop though, we were 2 minutes too late.  I looked inside like a little orphan at the window.  They have the greatest stuff!  I plan to go back, maybe Wednesday before I leave.  It was very close to the station and easy to get back to.    Harry Potter comes out on the 26th here.  I may have to go by myself! *cries* I doubt anyone else will want to go.  mmm,  my parfait just came.  Don't eat by the computer they say...heh.  Im at an internet cafe and we had to order sopmething to  get to use the internet.  Pretty expensive parfait, but it has rasberries in it!!  I love rasberries, and Japan always only has strawberries.  This is sweet!  Gonna go eat it and surf a bit!!

      Mood: it's raining    Go figure, it's the rainy season here in Japan.  Kinda sucks for one whose only mode of transport is a bike.   Rain or no rain I MUST get to the post office today!!  I haven't mailed the gifts I bought my cousins from Kyoto, OR the stuff I got my mom and dad from Tokyo.  GAH!  I really need to get some cds as well so I can burn my anime onto cd.  Maybe burn off all my Naruto manga scans, I really want to send a copy to my cousin so I can get her addicted to Naruto, cause it's so great.  Cept for the current (coughdragonballcough) story arch.  Dragging one plot point out way to far. *sigh*  I made a chibi Akamaru yesterday, I'm going to put the finishing touches on him today.  Little things like attaching his head to his body, stuff like that.　　He’s designed so that his front arms will clip around a strap.  He’s also entirely hand sewn, the little bugger.  I think it’s not too small to be machine sewn, but somehow I ended up doing it by hand.  Stupid me.  I also seem to be way behind on my plots to take over the world, I’ll go think one up right now, but all I have is ms paint.  You’ve been warned.

      Mood: summer's here!    We had a typhoon yesterday!  We're very much inland so only the corner hit us but they still cancelled school with a flood warning.  The weather wasn't really bad though.    Still continuing my addiction to Ragnarok Online.  It's interesting that there's only one race in the game.  That's not really the norm now-a-days.  Your supposed to be able to be an elf or a troll or something.  The differences in Ragnarok are defined by your job, and you can change your job.  So that's kinda neat.  I'm thinking of getting an actual account if this survives the initial interesting phase.  So many things get thrown away after a few days or weeks with me.  I really haven't grown up much. (^_^)` heh.  Growing up is over ratted.  Other than that nothing much interesting has happened lately.  Classes are as boring as usual.  Tests on Thusday and Friday.  I will have to bring my laptop to school.  Maybe if I take it in the computer room and hook it up then I can play games or something!

Those poor people who will have to change their links yet AGAIN.  I can customize all I want on tripod.  But I kinda like my profile thing, I can do that over there too though.  And Ill keep the chatbox thing too.  Sounds like Ive decided to move doesn't it?  You'll all know if I do.   urlLink The old one is here.    On a side note, large bug season has arrived. More on that when I dont have class immediately.

Had some time free today, you know... the whole day. So you wanna se what I get paid to do?  Blame this on a conversationi I had with Jennifer.  Only she and Tara-Lynn will really get it, but the first one is hilarious on it's own.  One of the teachers actually SAW that one.

      Mood: Hinata-Mode    I'm off to Nagoya this weekend.  I'm cosplaying Hinata this time. The third and last of the aforementioned 'set'.  (see below post) unfortunately I don't have the right stuff to make the Byakugan veins.  I'm going to get some of the stuff AFTER the con, I think that's irony.  I was reading a blog today, and it really struck me how lucky I am that my friends are who they are.  It strikes me a lot actually, I just would never have written it down before I got this blog last May.  It was someone I know back home, but noone that reads THIS blog me thinks, and it struck me because of how whiney they were.  Now, you may be confused at that, but this person isn't one of my friends, just a friend of a friend in a technical sense.  It was one of those moments where you get an insight into how petty people can be, and how some people can take every tiny thing that happens and make it bad so that its one BIG bad thing.  Then, because of that, they think the world is horrible to them and that  all people other than themselves are idiots .  That's really what bugs me, I  HATE  that attitude. You know them, the person who is complaining (maybe not ALL the time) but instead of sympathy you just look and think 'what?' Some people really DO have big bad things happen to them, and they might complain too, but I can be glad that they don't make a habit of writing off all the people who cause the problems as 'just idiots' or 'uninformed'. As a matter of fact I have learned so many things about positive coping with things from Shannys blog, its not even funny.  Id like to think that we know enough to say that they're idiots but people too.  I realize that it's too easy to belittle how other people feel because you aren't the one feeling it, but I also really respect people who can come to terms with the idea that EVERYONE has a brain, even if you don't see it most the time.  Gah, sorry to rant guys, but it does bug me when I see that part of some peoples personalities.  Makes me want to turn away and wait for them to move on.  Luckily,  I CAN !   WOO!    Wow this is starting to be a very long post, and you have to read through all my hate the bitches stuff just to get down to the good stuff.  Well... that would make   this   the good stuff, and I 'm not really sure I can assert that with any confidence. I CAN use large and metagrobolizing language to state it though!   ...yes, I looked up that word.  What, do I look like Jen?  Bet she even knew what that WAS!  It means confusing.  P.S.  The spell Checker told me to change Shanny to Shanghai... hehehe

      Wackiness: 60/100 Rationality: 56/100 Constructiveness: 62/100 Leadership: 58/100    You are a WRCL--Wacky Rational Constructive Leader. This makes you a golden god. People gravitate to you, and you make them feel good. You are smart, charismatic, and interesting. You may be too sensitive to others reactions, especially criticism. Your self-opinion and mood depends greatly on those around you.  You think fast and have a smart mouth, is a hoot to your friends and razorwire to your enemies. You hold a grudge like a brass ring. You crackle.   Although you have a leader's personality, you often choose not to lead, as leaders stray too far from their audience. You probably weren't very popular in high school--the joke's on them!  You may be a rock star.    Jans thoughts... wow Tara-Lynn what a test.

      Mood:    So, right now I have been at work all day, sitting right here all day, didn't EVEN go for lunch!  Why?  You DARE ask me why??  So I could update my webpage and give you undeserving gits some pictures!!!  So you'd better head on over to  urlLink bakachan.com.  The layout is new, as are the spelling errors and the purikura section.  Make sure you go to the purikura, it's what I was working on all day.  I wouldn't have taken so long but I wanted the closeups to open in certain sized windows and they were opening off an image map so none of the html I used was working.  But I learned how to do  urlLink THIS  So, I debated making all the links like that, but it would have meant going back and cutting up the main page pictures and making a table that would work for it all an too much bloody hassle.  So deal with sloppy ugliness in the big picture presentations, that's all yer getting from me.  Oh and on a side note, I am now annoyed at my Hayate idea.  How dare he have that weird middle bang that hangs down so far, doesn't he KNOW thats just gonna be soo ichy!?  Good thing I have lots of extra hair from when I got it cut.  I have to make a little extension thing for the middle of my bangs.    mendoukuse naaa.   PPPPPS, Everytime I say 'mendoukuse' the teacher Im talking to will say mendoukuSAI.  I think theyre trying to get me to be less crass.   For those who have no idea what I mean, mendoukuSAI is like saying, 'oh, how troublesome'  whereas mendoukuSE has more of a 'what a &#%$ing pain in the A$$ this is'-kinda feel to it.  But of course since were still talking about japanese here, neither are really cursing at all, just different politeness levels.

      Mood: It's a bit hot out...    Well I have done what I can with this blog, but I still just cant fix the big type problem.    As many of you know, I am getting to cosplay a lot.  I usually choose my characters based on a few things.   1. Can I look like them?  aka do I have the right hair without the annoyance of a wig?   2. If I have a great idea for the costume, like the Naruto sleeping hat.  Thats worth wearing a wig for. 3. Of course, if I WANT to.  I just HAD to have the bugs!!  THE BUGS!!!  (note: I still find random clay bugs in my apartment and often think they are real, causeing near death attacks of the heart)   Sooooo, most of you don't care.  But I had one of those epithanies today!  My action potential was firing away!!  Goes something like --> I looked in the mirror and scowled at the bags under my eyes, no amount of wearing my contacts will make them go away, I hate them!!  I look like friggin Hayate, *cough* *cough*  ... BING!  I HAVE that jounin vest! Ive been waiting for cooler weather so I could do Kakashi since wigs are kinda hot to be under.  BUT, I could soooo do Hayate!  I even have the right hair just now, my eartails are just by my chin line now since I have switched to Hinata hair.  (Just cut it yesterday) woooo.  I am very happy with this idea.    Oh and what IS up with the coughing?  Is that guy sick?  I mean he's a medical nin, how can he be perma-sick? And the BIG question?   Should I wear the little triangle that's the Japanese way of depicting a dead person or not?  I think so.

      Mood:   I always post so much at one time, it must be confusing for you guys.  I am trying to make my template leet.  But it simply won't have any of that.  The text just under the chatbox continues to be huge no mater what template I use and every now and then the new kanji of the day and phrase of the day boxes decide to join in the fun.  *sigh*  Anf the chatbox is a javascript, so what am I suposed to do about that?  I've tried deleteing so many things, I think I need to ADD something, but you guys know that I don't actually know html, right?  just links, images and breaks.  That's why I have to change a blogger template and not make one myself.  That, and making one would be such a pain in the ass even if I DID know how.

      Mood: BUNSHIN!   I made that yesterday!  It's a banner for my website. I have one without my  website on it, but tripod is being weird and won't let me into that folder.  I have started making the large scroll duffelbag that I was planing for a while.  I wanted to take an aluminum chimney pipe and use it as the base cylinder but they just don't come with the girth I need. So, there's this thing here that you get clean outside of the bath so when your soaking, your not getting the bath water dirty, cause everyone will use the same bath water.  So, to keep the water warm there's a cover for the bath.  Mine a roll up type and is curently being used in place of the chimney pipeing.  I have it tied to two metal disks to keep the round shape, "Almighty Gridiron"s they were called.  And when I say tied I mean tied in true Brian Murphy style AKA way over-done.  It took me forever to punch all the string through the rubber parts that hold the hard plastic parts of this thing together.  I took some pictures so I would have 'in process' pics.  I'll let you see them later.  Yes, it's yet another one of Jan's projects.  I stayed up way too late working on it.  Damn this 8 to 4 crap.  I should be able to stay up for 3 days to finish this and crash, but nooooo, gots me an office jooob!  phooey on yucky office job!!

      Mood: bushin!   I made many Naruto gifs today but didn't make that one.  Might make my own version of it though.  Decided I'm going to do the Hayate cosplay in Nagoya this weekend.  Then I won't be sick of the Hinata one when I do it at Comiket.  Truth be told, I just flipped a coin.
