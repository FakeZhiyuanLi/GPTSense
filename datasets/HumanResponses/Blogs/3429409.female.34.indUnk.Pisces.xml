      There’s something about rain pattering on the window.  All night I lay in my warm bed, duvet wrapped round me listening to the sound of the rain outside, hitting the pavement, dripping off the window ledges and gutters.  It’s been lashing it down, saturating the whole world while I stay dry and warm.   Nothing in the world like it.  It’s such a safe feeling.

      Woke up in a lovely mood  Wide awake, refreshed, ready for a good stretch and the rest of my day. Felt like a new woman, really giddy and full of beans.  The reason for my good mood?    Dennis from Eastenders.    Oh I know, even if I did meet him I'd be the last woman on earth he'd ever bother with, but the way he treated me in my dream last night... I woke up feeling like an angel, beautiful glow and everything.    Thinking about it makes me blush right down to me toes.

      Had a bit of a houseful today... E my neighbour was round most of the day.  made some scones and insisted on staying the whole day saying that she knows what a downer I've been on and it's her job to cheer me up.  So I had her and the dog round making noise and mess, making me laugh.    Then D came back with that lad of hers.  Met him for the first time.  He's a funny looking lad - gangly arms and legs, and sticky out ears, but I can see why she likes him.  He's all eyes and smiles, bit shy but I don't know whether that was just me, kept calling me Mrs S even though I've never been married.  Made us all laugh.  He was trying to be all polite and I kept telling him to just call me by my first name but he didn't listen.  He ate four scones one after the other like he's never fed at home. E wrapped one up in some kitchen roll to take home for his supper.    And I couldn't help but notice how dirty his nails were, normal I suppose for someone who works in a garage but you'd have thought he'd have cleaned up a bit to come and meet his girlfriends mum.  I guess he's a boyfriend, although she never says, insists they're just friends, but we'll see.  I can see the way they look at one another, a bit edgy like they're skirting round eachother.  We sat round the table all laughing and none of us having a clue what we were laughing at.  Nervous I guess.  It's good to see her happy.  Told her after he'd gone, "seems like a nice lad, BE CAREFUL".  A mums job that, putting a dampner on it.  I've known lads like him you see.  Lovable rogues.

      well that was successful.  did the bathing thing and banged myself on the handle of the boiler cupboard giving me a nose bleed.  There I was in the nud, dripping bath water and blood on the lino, trying to pull off a bit of bog roll. Ended up with soggy tissues and blood stains on my bath mat. It wouldn't stop bleeding for ages. I was wrinkled like a prune from my long soak, and shivering with cold because I couldn't dry myself at the same time as pinching my nose.  D kept shouting "what ARE you doing in there?" and barged in.  She thought I'd hurt myself and nearly had a fit. Eventually it stopped, and I could finally put some clothes on and tidy up a bit.  I was too traumatised to do anything else after that.  D made us some sandwiches and we sat and watched telly.    Not done much since then.  Don't want to bring on another one.

      Haven't been able to muster up the energy for this blog all week.  I've been glued to the couch, remote control in my hand, watching all the crap on the telly.  Been hard to motivate myself - in a sluggish mood.  One minute dragging into the next.  Knowing that all I have to do is ANYTHING to make it different.  I have been in a real mood.  Barely spoken to D, been moping around from one minute to the next not caring about anything.  Complete slob.  Now I feel guilty.  D brought me flowers to try and cheer me up, and it should be me buying her flowers to apologise for being such a lazy moaning pain in the arse.  So the plan is:  BATH  get myself into some kind of respectable state involving clean hair, self and clothes.  TIDY  get this place looking a bit more spick n span, pick all the magazines, drity cups and other crap off the floor, vids back in boxes, dirty clothes in the wash, towels off the bathroom floor.  You get the picture.  It's a mess.   FOOD  cook me and D a lovely tea spaghetti bol - our favourite.  Make a lovely salad and maybe even an apple pie for pud  DAUGHTER  spend some time with D making up for the miserable company I've been this week, actually find out how her week's been instead of always being 100% focused on my own life... see how she is... chat, gossip, and laugh  TOMORROW  make it a good day, try and fill it with useful things, and try TRY to take the steps I need to take to get me out of this flat.  I need to move on with my life, stop being a mope and get on with it... otherwise it'll be gone before I realise it.

      Just watched loose women.    (You know there was a time when I never hardly watched any TV, one of my main occupations these past months.)     They were discussing dads, good dads, dads who leave.  I love that programme.  They’re a great bunch of feisty real women.  I didn’t agree with everything that was said though.  Emailed in (as I usually do) but didn’t get a mention.    My dad was never there much.  He was a drinker so he was either at work or down the pub.  I have some memories when I was really young of him tucking me in at night and telling me stories.  It got less and less as I got older though.  He either came in way after bedtime, or he passed out asleep on the settee.  It got so that we had to tiptoe around so as not to wake him.  If we woke him up by running around or shouting or being noisy, he’d go mental.  He woke up grouchy and would get himself in the worst temper with us.  I used to shut myself in our bedroom.  Mum used to get it in the neck because she wasn’t keeping us quiet.  He could be a violent bastard sometimes.  Mum died a few years ago and I lost contact with him properly, but still used to see him now and again coming out of the club.  Always worse for wear, propping himself against the wall trying not to piss his pants.  Pathetic really, but it’s his loss.  D’s dad Jimmy is a bit of a waste of space as well, but it’s not his fault really.  He’s got emotional problems.  I just wish he would keep in touch with us more regular.  D never talks about him, but I know it hurts her.  I can see it in her eyes, when he lets her down and she tries to pretend she’s alright about it.  “ Nah I’m alright mum honest .”  Honest.   I guess the subject of dads is a sore one in this flat.

      It was so sunny out today.  I watched the kids playing in the park.  It’s less of a park really more like a scrap of grass between blocks.  The kids call it the wreck.  I can see it from the front windows in the flat.  There were two kids with water guns and they were spraying each other and there was so much laughing.  Water everywhere.  They were soaked.  D stayed out after school with that lad she likes, Dave.  She seems really keen on him.  I hope she’s sensible.  I don’t want her getting caught out like me.  Of course I wouldn’t change things for the world now, but it was tough and I want her to do the best she can for herself.  She’s a clever girl.  I talked to her about being sensible, but she just gets embarrassed and pulls that face like she’s sucking on a lemon and whines “muuum”.  It makes me laugh.  She rolls her eyes and says to me “I know about sex mum we learnt it in school.”   I know I’m an old moaner to her, and I keep reminding her how its good to wait.  Do kids listen to any of that these days?  I watched this thing on the TV tonight, and this fella was going ape about his 14 year old daughter sleeping with a 19 year old lad.  Called him a paedophile.  I thought, get a grip love.  There’s real paedophiles in the world, don’t be getting your facts mixed up.  Of course it’s a worry that young girls always go with older fellas.  Girls these days look so old.  It’s scary.  My D is young looking for her age.  She was a slow developer if you know what I mean.  I think she’ll be sensible and wait for a good few years yet.  She’s a good girl.  Am I being naïve?

      I'm in the middle of a book that I don't want to put down.   Lucky  by Alice Sebold.  It's got me gripped, I just don't want to put it down.    She's brave putting it all down on paper like that.  Don't think I could do it - describe in all that detail being raped.  It's very real.  Makes me shudder just thinking of it.  Brings up old things.   She got through it though... all that pain and trauma.  Lot of strength in that woman.

      First time I got drunk I was thirteen.  A lad in my class had a party.  He lived out in the sticks, and invited a load of us over for his birthday.  His mam and dad went out leaving us to down bottles of sweet cider, blast music out the stereo, and break everything in the house.    I got in a right state.  Fell over me own (and everyone else’s) feet and ended up puking on Darren Staniland’s trainers… while he was wearing them.  Not a pretty sight.  Didn’t have the experience to tuck my hair behind my ears, so there were crusts of dried vomit in my hair and on my cheek.  I ended up calling his mam a boring cow, and tried to snog some random poor sod who quite rightly turned me down.  Didn’t half get a bollocking when I got in.  I thought they’d be in bed but both of them were waiting up for me, sat at the kitchen table in the dark.  Just to add that element of surprise, as I fumbled with my key in the lock, and stumbled over the pile of shoes and wellies by the back door.  All those excuses I used… thinking they couldn’t smell the booze on my breath, and spot the drunken glaze.  Kids think their parents are daft don’t they.  My D for one.  Telling me  but I wasn’t drunk mam, I only had a glass and left most of it .  Fine story.  Must think I was born yesterday.

      she was suffering this morning.    I got up early and made a fry up, but not even the smell of sizzling sausages and crispy bacon could entice her out of her pit. I heard the bathroom door slam once or twice, and her retching.  I'm such a bad mother but honestly I didn't think she drunk that much... only poured her one glass.  anyway that'll teach her... lesson in there somewhere

      Feeling a bit tipsy had too many spritzers.  E ended up staying all afternoon.  She brought a bottle with her and we guzzled it in less than an hour.  Sent D out to get more and the three of us sat round the table putting the world to rights and filling our glasses fill to spilling over.  Went right to my head.  I can't handle my drink well...    Not like I used to.  When me and Jimmy were together we were like sponges, absorbing all that alcohol.  Looking back I dont know how we did it   great times.  E has a wicked laugh.  bet she was a right one in her day.

      I’ve got E coming round soon.  She’s my neighbour.  Lives two doors down with her fluff ball dog.  No pets allowed in the block but that’s never stopped her.  She lets him out to poop on the balcony, scoops it up with a dustpan that’s especially reserved for him.  Treats him like a little prince she does.  He eats better than any of us.  She chops up steaks for him, pork chops, braised lamb.  Shampoos his coat in the bath using special soap she gets from the pet shop.  She calls him  Sunshine .  What kind of name is that for a pooch?  She’s a good old girl - keeps me company most days.  She pops over in the afternoons, tells me all the gossip, makes me laugh.  It makes me feel like I’m not missing out so much because she brings the outside in.  She’s got a great turn of phrase, knows just the right way to describe something.  Take yesterday.  She was telling me about M shaving his beard off.   -	“ It’s like seeing him naked  ” she said “ his jowls wobbling, like five bellies spilling over a tight pair of pants .” I knew exactly what she meant.  E’s a good friend.  Twice my age at least, but it’s like she’s not a day older.  Laughs with her whole body.  Don’t know what I’d do without her.

      D finally calmed down and said sorry.  I said I was sorry as well.    We made our peace over a pepperoni pizza and a bottle of cream soda.  She curled up on the settee with me, like she always did when she was little.  I let her take charge of the remote, and we had a night of watching soaps.  We didn't talk about our row.  Some things are better left unsaid.  Knowing us it would only just erupt again.  She made me a lovely cup of tea and we said no more about it.

      D came home from school early.  She just accosted me when I was in the middle of eating a cheese and pickle sandwich.  She slammed her schoolbag on the table between us, and gave me one of them black looks that I know spell trouble.  -  "You piss me off" she said.  Just like that.  No hello or anything.  I told her straight, "I don't like that kind of language madam."  -  "I don't give a shit what you think about my language" she said, spitting her words at me.  "I want to know when you're gonna get off your arse and do something."  -  I was gobsmacked.  I said, "Excuse me!  No daughter of mine talks to me like that".  My cheeks were on fire, I'm telling you, I was fuming.  Do you know what she said then?   -  "and no mother of mine is going to sit on her fat arse on the couch all day watching shit on telly, like an embarrassing mess."  I wanted to slap her.  I walked through to the other room and left her to stew in her juices.  She just stormed out the flat again slamming the front door so that it rattled in its hinges.  I would never have dared speak to my mother like that.  I'd have got a right hiding. How dare she speak to me like that.

      This cold/flu thing is dragging me down a bit.  Funny how little it takes to get me feeling down, and all my insecurities kick in.  Like for example, being ill, the aches and twinges, confirm exactly why I should stay in the flat.  I suppose its all fears.  SOMETHING MIGHT HAPPEN, SOMETHING MIGHT HAPPEN.  My mind ticks overtime… what would I do if… this happens or that happens.  I start feeling edgy, panicky, worry about losing my breath, not knowing where I am, getting confused, people watching me, not being able to escape it.  Crazy.  I wonder sometimes if I’m losing it.    There was the time at Christmas when I was out shopping.  Everything was fine, normal.  I was just getting on with it, buying presents, browsing.  Then this pain in my belly, only a mild pain but as soon as I noticed it… the day slipped from beneath me, threw me off kilter.   I walked all the way down Deansgate.  The rain was constant.  My coat was zipped right up to the top, my hood was up, and I just kept walking holding on to my stomach, putting one foot in front of the other, thinking just keep walking, keep walking.  I had this feeling I wanted to cry, but of course the tears wouldn’t come.  People passed me shopping.  I felt so apart from everyone, so alone, so anonymous, so invisible.  Nothing was unfamiliar but nothing was familiar.  Deansgate felt like the longest road.    It was such a sudden sinking low and I couldn’t place where the feelings came from.  My body was on autopilot.  I went back to the flat, lay on the bed, feet sticking off the end, shoes still on.  I don’t know what I thought of.  I know I didn’t sleep.  Just stuck my head in the sand for a while, hid, switched off from life, opted out, did nothing apart from lie there.  I don’t know how I got home.    The flip side of living life in this flat, playing it safe…  is that life is as dull as dishwater.  Day after day after day of the same thing, and me sat here knowing I’m wasting it, knowing that the days, weeks, months are passing and I’m not getting any younger.    Need to find a way to change it.

      Come to think of it, I do remember that fortnight in Majorca.  Every bloody minute… best holiday I ever had.  All that sun.  Lovely tans.  I mean, I was only seventeen, had a figure to die for.  We spread ourselves on our beach towels, bikini tops off and we lapped up every minute of all that sun, and the attention we got. There were fellas throwing themselves at us.  Dozens.  Don’t think I bought myself a single drink that holiday.  Big glasses of gin with a splash of orange.  Oh we got drunk.  Falling all over ourselves… pissed as rats we were.  Went skinny dipping and everything.  The others they got off with a few fellas, but me… I was never like that really.  There was only one lad that caught my eye.  Steve his name was, Geordie bloke.  Couldn’t understand a word he was saying sometimes, but he was the bees knees, treated me like a princess the whole holiday.  Never pushed me to get my knickers off, like most of the lads back home.  Just happy to sit with us, have a few drinks and a dance, walked me back to the apartment when the girls buggered off and left me.  Shagging on the grass under the bloody sprinklers one of them, after that the other two wanted a go as well.  But not me, I was walked home by Mr Wonderful, and he didn’t push me, not one bit.    He wrote to me for a while, was besotted. I don’t always see what’s good for me at the time do I?  Should’ve snapped him up.      Look at me now.  Can barely cope with opening the front door let alone getting a taxi down to the airport.  Ashamed of myself I am.  Let myself down with it all.  I need a good kick up the arse. Wish someone would grab me by the arm and just drag me out. Have no choice but deal with it then.

      Well she came home.  Bringing a storm with her.  She swept into her room and slammed the door without so much as a word for me.  She expected me to follow so I didn’t.  I expect she’ll tell me whatever it is she wants to get off her chest when she’s ready.  It’s been a hellish long day.  I couldn’t tell whether the heat was from outside or from me.  I’ve been a wave of hot sweats, and shivers.  I just wish I could get some of it out.  Need to get all the snot out that’s bunging up my nose and my head.  Ears keep popping, feeling like I’m in a bloody aeroplane (only been in one once… trip to Majorca with the girls.  Before D came along, a long time ago, barely remember it now.)  Been lying in bed for ages, tossing and turning.  Don’t think I’m going to sleep a wink tonight.  Going to make myself a hot chocolate.

      She still hasn’t come back.  I’ve been looking out for her through the front window.  I can usually spot her coming with that red jacket she wears and her hair bobbing in a ponytail behind her.  But I’ve not spotted her.  I phoned M at the paper shop but he hasn’t seen her since her round this morning and that was early.  She hasn’t even done her jobs today. It’s only the electric needs topping up, but still she normally gets it done on Saturdays.  She’s probably out with that lad she keeps telling me about… what’s his name?  Can’t remember.  I’m a bit worried about that.  I mean she’s says he’s a nice lad and I’m sure he is, but she’s only young.  I don’t want her getting into any bother.    I’m a fine one to talk.  I was terrible at her age.

      Have just hoovered the flat and my arms are aching.  I’ve built up a right sweat.  It must be this flu I’ve got.  It’s wearing me out.  D went out first thing this morning and I haven’t seen her since.  I don’t blame her. It’s gorgeous outside.  She asked me if I wanted to go the park but with this flu and everything, I told her I wanted to stay inside and keep myself warm.  Better to keep warm indoors when you’ve got flu.  Call it mother’s intuition but I don’t think she believed me.  She had quite a strop about it, called me pathetic and said “you might as well stay in here forever and waste your fucking life”.    She doesn’t usually swear and I can tell you I was bloody annoyed with her.  For all she knows I might have gone out today if it wasn’t for this flu.  She doesn’t have a clue sometimes.  Anyway, she’ll come back when she’s ready.

      Have been wondering... where did I catch this cold when I haven't left the flat for four months?  Surrounded by tissues and on my third lemsip today.  Actually it's three months twenty two days to be exact.  My daughter keeps reminding me how long it's been on a daily basis.  It's her job, she tells me.  I am well aware of this fact.  This is just one in a growing list of jobs she has taken on... not her choice I guess but she does them without moaning. Jobs she has been lumbered with include  1.  putting the rubbish down the chute - this is one of the last tasks I think I could bear to carry out.  The chute is nineteen steps from our front door (believe me I have counted, it's a distraction technique that worked for a bit, but then failed me when the kid next door barged down the corridor towards me with his football and his mates and their dog, which incidentally is not allowed in this block.  It's supposed to be a pet-free zone)  2.  shopping - she hates going to Asda.  It's the walk back with heavy bags, and then often as not the lift is broken and she has to trudge up eight flights of stairs.  I told her she can book a taxi, but she says we can't afford it and I guess she's right.  I've been meaning to sort out my DLA but they insist I need an interview, and I''ve told them on the phone there's fat chance of me getting the bus down to the precinct.  They're supposed to be sending someone to see me at the flat, but nothing as yet.  3.  washing - which strangely she doesn't mind.  They've got MTV down at the laundrette, and she takes her homework down with her.  Tells me she gets peace down there if that makes any sense.  With all those washers and dryers going.    4.  posting letters/paying bills/running messages - I get them all together for her on a Saturday. She does all the odd jobs like that after her paper round.  Bless her.  She's a good un.  She's even started organising me a bit better.  Head's in the clouds sometimes if you know what I mean.  Hard to keep track of everything some weeks.  She's a great girl.  Don't know what I'd do without her at the moment.  She's the one who got me on the internet, thinks it might help me a bit, cos I'm in the flat all the time.
