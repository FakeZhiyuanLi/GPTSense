        bought a new CD last night, The Dresden Dolls. I like it a lot. We went to Tower Records and bought tickets to see Ministry for Greg's birthday. They cost a lot of money but not nearly as much as the Bjork tickets we bought for me. I bought tickets to see the pixies last week, They will actually be playing on the day of Greg's birthday. He's so excited. We made a pact a few years ago that for our birthdays the other would get to choose what we'll do that night. One year I chose to go to Magic Mountain for Greg's birthday. I don't remember what we did for my birthday, But I'm sure it was fun. I like doing that because it takes the selfishness out of birthdays and it also makes it more of an adventure for the birthdayee. anyways, check out the dresden dolls.    urlLink   www.dresdendolls.com      okay bye. . .

         I took the kids to the zoo today. I had to make-up for lost time yesterday since I wasted the day. I spent most of the day in traffic, San diego is Bad in that sense. it took me at least an hour and a half in both directions, to and from. but at least we had a good time. I wore jeans and comfy shoes and ended up getting WAY too hot. It has been pretty humid around here. oi! I heard some good music on the radio today. FM949 played the English beat and madness, also Peter Murphy. I think I need to download some stuff today. I am still in need of musical inspiration. I was happy to hear Peter Murphy. there were other things I heard but it's too hard to remember right now. It's late I need to go to bed.     how many 'rudeboys' does it take to screw in a light bulb? 4 - 1 to drop it and 3 to say 'pick it up! pick it up! pick it up!'

         I spent the ENTIRE day playing the Sims and now i feel completely lame. how awful. I can't believe I did that. . . I had a headache in the morning and so I decided to just take it easy and play for a while, well a while turned into a day and now I regret wasting my time. Ohwell.. some people live life to the extreme, why can't it be the extreme of playing video games all day?   I am in need of good music today. I need some inspiration. I can't wait for bjork's latest to come out. . . there is talk of a duet with Mike Patton from Faith No More. . . this is exciting. Recently Bjork hasn't been doing much for me. . . it seems to be a pattern, Bjork in the winter, something upbeat and fun for summer. I have been listening mostly to my own homemade compilations. I have favorites, and I sent one to my sister. sharing music gives me a fresh breath of life. Greg took me out on an impromptu date last night, the kids were making me nutty and he was sympathetic. We went to 'Dave and Busters', had drinks and played Time Crisis II. I won tickets playing this old time shooting game. I got prizes for the kids with the tickets. We also went to the movies and saw 'The Village' with Joaquin Phoenix. It was a good movie, but on a side note I think Joaquin is handsome. I remember seeing him on a movie when I was a kid and thinking he wasn't very cute. He has aged well, like a good bottle of wine. I am attracted to men who age well. George Clooney, John Travolta, and of course Henry!! Henry could be my dad. He's 19 years older than me. All these guys could be my dad, but Henry has a youthful exuberance that I can relate to at my young age. Unfortunately he also has a youthful cynicism I could do without.   I am looking forward to the kids being in school. The last few days I feel like I have run myself ragged trying to keep them entertained and out of harm's way. I had to take away their toys to try and get them to understand it is their responsibility to clean up after themselves. I know it sounds harsh but they have too many toys and we have a small apartment, so the mess just cannot be there. They were also in trouble for not listening to my words of warning against the high tide at the beach the other day. The ocean scares me but I try not to let that affect the way I judge their limits. I don't want my fear to affect their personalities. But there is a fine line between my fear and actual danger, I think the tide was riding that fine line and I felt conflicted. Is there actual danger or am I just being a spazz? I am constantly second guessing myself. Greg has accused me of being schizophrenic, maybe I am. . . maybe I'm not. . . God help me!!

      I am so bored.  my dear sister is right.  I got the 'book' from Tiffany.  I think I will work on it tonight.  i went and bought my birds some treats today.  they seem happy.  abe is stoked on the millet spray.  As soon as he saw it he could not take his eyes off it.  batbird is a jerk.  he/she reminds me of the fair Jub-Jub, who was also a jerk.  gotta get to work now.

       today was okay, I got some laundry done and did the dishes.  I bitched to Greg because I suspect the neighbors were using my laundry detergent.  He didn't care so I drew evil pirate pictures on the bottles and told them to keep away.  I hope they get the hint.  The kids played outside, Aryana cried because Cyrus made her drop her pet spider and she couldn't find it.  Greg got caught up on paperwork.  I went to the slowest gas station in the world.  It took about ten minutes to pump 27 gallons of gas. . . I felt bad for the lady that was waiting for me to finish.   We went for a little drive around 7pm  to measure a fence,  then went to Arby's and listened to Henry on the radio. . . he is so cool.  I hope he comes to town soon.  It would be fun to go to the radio station 'headquarters' and say 'hi' or something.  I don't really know what that would accomplish, but at least I could add it to my list of adventures.  Greg and I tried waiting outside, behind the Coach House to meet him, we ended up having the police search our entire car, including Greg's toolboxes.  I guess they were looking for drugs,  they probably thought, 'what kind of weirdos hang out in the back of a club just to meet someone famous?'  Yeah we're lame, but what else do you do when you have no money?  In the end it turned out that Henry wasn't there anyways.  We missed him the night before.  damn! I never win.  OH well, I enjoy playing.  I played my sims tonight, Totally (the cute blond guy I made) was promoted to Wedding Singer and so I rewarded him and bought some wallpaper for his pimpy little apartment.  stokawitzed!!  I am tired and I'm sure i could write a novel, but I will go.  untill next time. . . .

       I love my husband.  He has been on a surfing kick the last few days.  as I am sitting here wasting away in front of the computer, he's mumbling in his sleep, something about the pictures in the surfing magazine are too small.  he's so funny.  I just love him.

        two hours on this damn computer and I finally finished my profile and was able to post a picture. I analyzed the heck out of my answers, this isn't easy you know, this is being published on-line right? I have to be very careful of what I say. anyhow, i was trying to think of something witty but since it is 12:40 PM, I can't think of the right words. I even tried the dictionary. How pathetic. . . adieu
