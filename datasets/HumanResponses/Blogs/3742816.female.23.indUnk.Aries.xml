       •Mood: pleasant       •Music: Pearl Jam - Last Kiss   High time for an update I suppose! I've made some quasi, could-possibly-be progress in the past few days. Interviewed at the aforementioned Jewish Community Center, had a kickass interview for what would be a kickass job. It would start ft and go pt whenever I wanted/needed it to, accounting experience, no one there seems too imbecelic, and I could participate in the cause without...well, actually participating in the cause. So that's my number one choice. Then there's this admin assistant pt thing. Enh whatever, that would be okay, I'm sure I could function. If that happened though, I would hope that a pt accounting job I applied for today would work as well. And I got a call for something I applied for on a bit of a lark--a dog groomer. Yeah laugh it up there. Too bad it's ft, I don't think I can devote the rest of my life to that, and the main problem at the moment is  experience , and getting some before heading to LA. So that's that front.   Not a whole heck of a lot else. Saw  urlLink Jeux d'enfants  (Love Me If You Dare), I enjoyed it quite a bit, about as much as Eternal Sunshine..., which I found similar somehow, though I couldn't explain why. Larrett just refered to himself as a "stiff prude" on the phone, that's funny stuff. He's going to Flag this weekend, so now I don't know what to do for the 4th. No one here I particularly want to hang out with, maybe I'll go to Flag too and stalk my old obsession, or my ex, they're both there livin in the same complex! small world. I guess there's always crazy Ron.

       •Mood: pessimistic       •Music: Dire Straits - Romeo & Juliet (bad, I know)   Why is this finding a decent job proving so difficult? I turned down a part-time, slave labor, work-out-of-a-home-office, set-up-my-accounting-from-scratch position today. The guy was an arrogant cheapskate but he did have one good line, "It was a halfway house and we're turning it into a bar/nightclub." I have never heard Scottsdale summed up so succinctly. Meanwhile the Jewish Community Center hasn't called me yet. How amusing would it be to work there? *sigh* perhaps Monday. I try not to stress about it on weekends when there's really nothing to be done, but poverty is so debilitating! I'm going on a date for food tomorrow, sinking back to old lows. Larrett didn't get his potential good job either so we're in a sorry state around here. Oh and my insurance billing is still super screwed up, even after I've called  twice.  Today I got a deliquent notice for $450 when I don't owe them  anything  til the 1st--and only $100 even then! Ahhhh!

       •Mood: blank  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; •Music: Alkaline Trio - All On Black  Welp, Tender is the Night is finally finished, thank heavens! It was appropriately depressing. I might have to reread Catcher in the Rye next, as its value was sapped by my being at war with my english teacher at the time. Or I'll grab something new with a pretty cover from the list below. Things have been uneventful lately, went home to Ktown last weekend for father's day. How I relish leaving here! 5 months... Otherwise just been interviewing and crap. I finished this little project I started ages ago--too bad Al won't get to see it til August.

          thursday, june 17, 2004     the story of neighbor bear   •Mood: silly  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; •Music: Donna Lewis - Now In A Minute    Third person talker guy has another nickname with Larrett and I, furry little bear, because shirtless...well you get the idea, I needn't go into the hairy details (ba bum ching!). So he invites himself in yesterday and I ask him about this woman who was visiting him last week. I was quite curious cause this guy isn't exactly hot property on the market. He doesn't have it going on physically, financially, or most importantly personality wise, thus this primped up chick in a 40 grand Subaru got my attention. At some point during his evasive replies he referred to himself as "Andy bear" which had us practically rolling on the floor, what with already having the bear moniker for him. Then, this guy who never asks anyone else any questions at  all  cause he's so self absorbed, called me nosey bear! So of course I adopted it wholeheartedly. I am nosey bear.      sunday, june 13, 2004     Slothy   •Mood: lazy &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; •Music: The Killers - Mr. Brightside   I've done absolutely nothing today. Have an interview tomorrow for a great job, just what I've been looking for. Perhaps it would get me going forward again--I feel like I've been reverting to the past lately. Not that that's all bad. Amusing monikers for guys have returned, except whereas before it was for people whose actual names I didn't know, now it's better names for people I see regularly. My roommate has been dubbed 'all over the place guy'; the apartment complex holds 'lone hot guy', 'third person talker', and 'schizophrenic foreigner guy'. But more importantly, I wouldn't have to scrape together change for Del Taco and watch my credit card bills amass every month. We live in hope.   In other news... Tender Is The Night  by F. Scott Fitzgerald is officially the slowest read ever. Not bad, but for some reason it's taking me eons to read. I don't even remember when I started, about halfway done now, but I must be averaging one or two pages a day. Saw Stepford Wives last night, it had all kinds of production problems and it shows. There's a major recurring conceptual problem and miscast Matthew Broderick's acting does less than nothing for me. John Cusack (originally cast) would have been much better. Not that it doesn't have its clever well written moments (the AOL and Connecticut lines come to mind) and Roger Bart is great, but overall, quite mediocre.      monday, june 7, 2004     procrastination   •Mood: amused &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; •Music: Sunset Boulevard ...you remind me of me long ago...

Three items now haha.      sunday, june 6, 2004     why am I still standing alone at the beginning...   •Mood: confused &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; •Music:  Donna Lewis & Richard Marx - At The Beginning    I almost went to LA today. Really wanted to, no job to stick around here for, but there's this little issue of...money--extreme lack thereof. And why is that? Because Scott didn't pay me. Or rather, I couldn't take it because I had this sudden vision of a certain Hostess product. And now I'm thinking, what did it matter? I wasn't emotionally involved! Damn ingrained moral code. What's that thing still hangin on for? So now, I turned down a job and place to stay in NY,  and  I have no money. Screwed that one up didn't I! ha, however, I can't be too bitter because I have this strong inclination that it's all for the best. The gut feeling was, no, that's not the path. I do need a job though, abject poverty isn't really good times. I'll work on that this week.      tuesday, june 1, 2004     NY recovery    •Mood: relieved &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; •Music: Jackson Browne - Running on Empty  Is it ever good to be home. What a strange trip that was. I spent most of the time at Scott's--half of that doing accounting, and half...other stuff. I've always known I'm a westerner at heart, but this trip really confirmed it. Gotta get focused again, make LA happen.    I look around for the friends that I used to turn to to pull me through  Looking into their eyes I see them running too  Running on, running on empty...   Honey you really tempt me  You know the way you look so kind  I'd love to stick around but I'm running behind  You know I don't even know what I'm hoping to find  Running into the sun but I'm running behind

       •Mood: careless       •Music: Our Lady Peace - Life  Well things still suck, but that's unimportant. Today I witnessed my first real threat-of-violence altercation! And I must say, it was hilarious.   Breakdown:   Party 1:  Andy--6'0", goofball, aggressively friendly and a little crazy by his own admission, third person nonenunciating fast talking, daily drinking neighbor whose door is about 5 feet from ours.  Party 2:  'the black guy'--5'8", very stocky, suspected drug dealer who used to live on the other side of Andy but now lives a building away in our complex, and appears to be the only tenant to occasionally warrant the attention of law enforcement.   Backstory:  This seemingly began about a week ago when P2 asked to borrow P1's bike as his car wouldn't start. P1 had previously tried his aggressively friendly methods on P2, unlike all the rest of us (read: the smart ones) who use a very popular Phoenix technique known as  the ignore . P1 had thus given out drinks, advice, air pumps and what have you over the past few months to this shady second party. When asked for his bike though, P1 drew the line, he needed that bike to get to school after all. However, he failed to decline the bike nomination gracefully [error1], as he is not a graceful individual, but rather prides himself on blunt honesty. P2 bristled at this, but apparently time was of the essence and he went off to  steal  borrow from someone else. A few days later our two friends crossed paths on Mill Ave and P2 informed P1 that he wasn't down with P1's disrespect. Only a few words were exchanged and both parties went on their merry ways.  Here we catch up with this evening. As I wandered out to get the mail at around 10pm, P1 wandered down to P2's apartment to try to rectify the situation [error2] in what was a brief unfriendly encounter primarily with the female occupant of the place. Why he did this he later justified with "I can't stand anyone thinking badly of me, it's just how I am". I did not know of his destination or the interaction at the time, as he appeared to simply be walking aimlessly behind me. I sat outside and talked with P1 for about half an hour after getting the mail, about nothing in particular, the usual arguing  engaged in with a know-it-all who is actually very uninformed. Growing tired of this, and it still being 90ish outside, I excused myself to go do indoor things. Not five minutes later I heard a knock on P1's door. My usual thought "ooh people! entertainment!" sent me back over grabbing the knob to see who it was. However, before I had a chance to pop out, P1 answered the door, thinking it was me, only to be confronted by P2 holding a length of pipe. "Why you disrespectin' me and my woman!?" rang out loud and clear. At this point I locked my own door, picked up my phone, lest it should be necessary, and peered out the peephole at the interesting show, though I wasn't too concerned. A yelling match ensued whereby P1 yelled about what a good friend he'd been, and how he needed his bike, and that he hadn't disrespected the "woman" in question at all by merely trying to further explain about needing the bike. P2 yelled about how P1 had a truck and could have lended the bike (obviously not understanding ASU parking), and how his woman had been disrespected by P1's attitude (obviously not used to P1's manner of speaking). P1 then yelled about P2 coming over with a "club" as if to knock him off, to which P2 responded  "my leg hurt" . Huh? It is just me or is that the worst excuse  ever  for initially trying to be intimidating with a length of pipe. Wow. I might point out, the length wasn't nearly long enough to be sufficient for substituting as a crutch. Thus the backdown had begun and P1 essentially yelled P2 back into the street and he went away. P1 then came over and ranted at me about it, and unhappily insisted that P2 had "won" because he was still ranting at me about it 20 minutes later. My word, who are these people and how did I get here?

       •Mood: lazy       •Music: Carly Simon - All I Want Is You   This picture reminds me of a time when I was alternately very content and quite miserable. Not unlike now. The best thing about it though, is that a great cartoon character could no doubt be developed just from Rob's expression. At least three of those people are currently in love. At least one isn't ha. Why did I wear that dull green shirt? How did Rick manage not to have any clothing showing at all? These were the thoughts I indulged in today. Needless to say, it was a very unproductive day.   I got an email from an individual I grew up with in Kayenta who still lives there. All the people in that picture combined were never as judgemental as this single person was in their one short email. That town tends to breed a strange form of self righteousness. I was there last weekend. Being summer, it was the usual ghost town, making it easy to avoid those who irritate the hell out of me.  "I'd like to return this sweater, out of spite."  I have this very strong urge to 'show them all' or some such nonsense. Nonsense because it would serve no purpose and they'd pretend not to notice. I guess the satisfaction would come in knowing them well enough to know they did notice and purposely pretended not to. Stupid. I must get out of this state, it's imperative to my sanity.

       "I found myself back in the sepulchral city resenting the sight of people hurrying through the streets to filch a little money from each other, to devour their infamous cookery, to gulp their unwholseome beer, to dream their insignificant and silly dreams. They trespassed upon my thoughts. They were intruders whose knowledge of life was to me an irritating pretence, because I felt so sure they could not possibly know the things I knew. Their bearing, which was simply the bearing of commonplace individuals going about thier business in the assurance of perfect safety, was offensive to me like the outrageous flauntings of folly in the face of a danger it is unable to comprehend. I had no particular desire to enlighten them, but I had some difficulty in restraining myself from laughing in their faces, so full of stupid importance. I daresay I was not very well at that time. I tottered about the streets--there were various affaris to settle--grinning bitterly at perfectly respectable persons. I admit my behaviour was inexcusable, but then my temperature was seldom normal in these days."

       •Mood: blank  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; •Music: Donna Summer   My perception is off. Perhaps it has been all year. I've been wrong about so much in the past few months. Wrong choices, wrong assumptions, it's making me really second guess myself. The dars are down--gaydar, navadar, qualidar. It's terrible. I'm calmer again now though, couldn't really sustain Wednesday's level of horror for long I suppose. On Thursday I met the male version of me, that was interesting...and frightening. We'll probably end up being good friends though. But I'm probably wrong about that. Enh whatever, back to the drawing board.

Isn't there a bottom? Haven't I hit it? Why is everything such a horror? Why wasn't that blood on the 51 to 202 overpass cleaned up? What was that little thought wishing it was mine? (please no cards or letters, I wouldn't) What's the point?

       •Mood: calm       •Music: Blink 182 - Feelin' This   Fountain Hills Community Theatre canceled their production of Ragtime because they were unable to cast it, even after two audition notices pleading for black people. At least they have their big giant fountain if not diversity! This has seriously got to be the only top ten city (populationwise) in the nation that could possibly have that problem. Watched  urlLink Jisatsu Circle (Suicide Club) . I found it strangely fascinating and quite entertaining, though anyone who has a problem with death, blood, bad Japanese kid pop groups named Dessart, or...death should probably avoid it. As with all movies of its type, there's an angry group of proles on imdb debating whether only idiots didn't get it, or if pretentious snobs just pretend there's something to get. It's of that genre. I've always had great respect and good dealings with police until Friday night. I got stopped for a moving violation in an  empty  strip mall, I totally own up to that, I went straight instead of right as the "right turn only" sign decreed. This guy though! I have never been spoken to with such incredibly rude condescension in all my life, and I've run into some major assholes in my time. But congratulations Mr. Motorcycle Cop on Ray Rd just west of I-10, you're the winner now! He didn't bother to get off his motorcycle or get my license, registration, proof of insurance,  nothing , he didn't even have anything on him with which to write citations. He pulled me over purely to belittle me. Told me he "could" give me a $150 ticket--hey driving without insurance is $450, without a license is about $150, and Arizona has some of the highest incidence of those, but you weren't too concerned about that were you? Thus the Awhatukee police force has made a permanent enemy in me. Yay!

       •Mood: jubilant       •Music: Linkin Park - Breaking The Habit    Unbelievable! Friday at 5:01pm I receive  the call . I got offered the nonprofit accounting job at the JCC, full time, with a raise at 60 days. I had resigned myself to failure, figured the jig was up, they'd called S____, my phony reference had been discovered, it was over. But no! They were just slow! Amazing. I swear I will never lie to a potential employer ever again. And I will not quit this job after two months. This is it, a year there and I have my ticket out of this city. And I don't have to dress up! Or answer phones! Ahhh  how the world may be changed in just one burst of light ! A humongous thank you to Larrett, Eliz, and Brant, credit where credit is due, I owe you all a huge favor.

There's also hope in my job search. I just returned from my second interview at the JCC, where I was basically told that as long as my "work" references checked out, I was hired and would start on Thursday or Friday. The quotes are because I don't really  have  any work refs and thus had to make due with...well I won't go into the dishonest details. From this point forward though, I tell ya, it's all about honesty, otherwise things just get waay too complicated and stressful. So that made the fact that my parents are leaving tomorrow on their Colorado vacation without me a little less sad. I'll still miss watching my mom drive hazardously slow though! ;)

       •Mood: tired       •Music: Josh Joplin Group - Camera One   I went out on a date last night with crazy Ron. It was hard. After about 10 minutes I decided to think of it as a 3 hour acting job at like 10 bucks an hour. That was slightly helpful. However, I did have the best steak of my life. Lesser cow parts will never be the same for me again. But the company was painful--if I had a job, it wouldn't have been worth it. I think I did pretty darn well though, he wrote me an email today, here's an excerpt:  "Everything comes down to 3 things: choice, destiny and sacrifice. After our conversation last night I decided that it's time for me to stop holding back and to get on it."  At least I can motivate other people. It reminds me of the Oscar Wilde quote:  "The only thing one can do with good advice is to pass it on. It is never of any use to oneself."  Strangely, when I have slightly too much to drink I tend to sleep terribly, and this was no exception, I'm probably going on 4 or 5 hours now on a Saturday, which is practically illegal.   As for the job hunt, I'm interviewing with "The Director" at the JCC on Tuesday, and with the really nice guy for the PT Admin on Wednesday. The best scenario is getting both positions, but I'd happily settle for one. There are no other options. Larrett's sister is coming down tomorrow for a week, that could be very interesting. Lastly, just for a chuckle...

I really need to list a ton of crap, it's just such an effort, particularly with clothes. What am I whining about?! I'm in no position to be too lazy to create income! I gotta get outta this city. It's pointless to stay. The cheapness involved in living here is such a shackle, going to practically any other city means a drop in standard of living. However, I don't care anymore! It's not worth it at  all . How anyone can be a Phoenix lifer is beyond me--save yourselves! get the hell out while there's still time! before getting entrenched! I woke up this morning and thought, I'm going to use exclamation points today like they're going out of style!

After all, someone like Bill Gates essentially started the game with more than the standard $1500, quite a bit more in fact. Oprah, on the other hand, figuratively began as a debtor, and now she determines what's on the New York Times bestseller list. That's quite an accomplishment.

       •Mood: blah       •Music: Alphaville - Forever Young   If you see a small perfectly opaque balloon from a few feet away, there's really no telling what's in it. I suppose you could eliminate the possibility of helium if it wasn't bobbing upright, but otherwise, it could be pudding, water, shit, a deck of cards, or it could be...nothing. I'm a nothing balloon. I tend to fool people who only see me from a distance, they assume I'm filled with something good, like pudding. I retain power by never letting them get close enough to discover that I'm absolutely empty.   I used to think I had all the answers, and it was comforting to know that. But did I really believe it deep down? Maybe I did, for a while. I'm not sure though, I don't think I remember the past very accurately when it comes to how I felt. I can associate joy and misery with individual events; but I don't really recall what the baseline was, it's all a haze, merely marked in spots by those specific events. How do people find a point or a purpose without religion? Suicide rates are higher in industrialized nations--we have the time to think about this kind of crap, and we're also forced to participate in capitalism. Money, love, consumerism, procreation, can this be all there is?
