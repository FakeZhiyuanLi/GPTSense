       urlLink David Gordon Green   david gordon green is potentially my favorite director; i say potentially because i've only seen two of his films ( george washington  and the illustrious  all the real girls ).  rumor had it that he was going to direct the film adaptation of  the confederacy of dunces , starring, strangely enough, will ferrell.  supposedly that's now fallen through.  however, green has committed to directing the secret life of bees.  i was only a lukewarm fan of the novel, but i have high hopes of what green can do with the material.  his specialty is a particularly languorous version of the south; i'd love to see him wrestle with the plucky, quick-witted, and overtly feministy characters of sue monk kidd's creation.

      wrote this awhile ago but it's (infortunately) still relevant:   At the 2002 Academy Awards when Michael Moore won in the documentary category for Bowling for Columbine, his speech was quickly drowned out by the audiences’ jeers and the peppy music escalating from the orchestra pit. The reason for this uproar? That Moore used the word “fictitious” to describe the unfolding war in Iraq. In a similar episode a couple months later, Chris Hedges had to be escorted of the campus of Rockford College in Illinois by security guards after giving a provocative commencement speech about the ongoing war. [1]  These incidents illustrate the public fury that meets those who question war and patriotic rhetoric during armed conflict. In his book,  War Is a Force That Gives Us Meaning , Chris Hedges explores the horrific phenomenon of war from the unique perspective of a former seminarian who became a war correspondent. The combination of Hedges’ years of firsthand experience in war zones and his capacity to grapple with the philosophical and cultural implications of war makes for a bold and cathartic book—one that challenges the reader to understand that whatever truth can be excavated from the mythological grandeur of war is truth that is painful, ugly, and far removed from conventional propaganda. Hedges stresses in the introduction that he is not immune to the intoxicating power of war. Rather, he writes from a position of repentance and even self-antipathy, likening his relationship with war to that of an addict to her preferred drug. He writes, “… There is a part of me that remains nostalgic for war’s simplicity and high, even as I cope with the scars it has left behind, mourn the deaths of those I worked with, and struggle with the bestiality I would have been better off not witnessing.” [2]  Hedges’ pain is evident throughout the book, and occasionally elevates the prose to the level of diatribe. Yet Hedges’ honesty about his susceptibility to war’s grasp is fundamental to the book’s success. By refusing to blame systems without blaming self, Hedges establishes a humble credibility. The reader is more likely to trust this flawed writer—trust both his firsthand accounts and the meaning he makes of them. Hedges’ credibility is essential, as the majority of the book’s references are literary. Hedges primary motivation is to expose the disconnection between the reality and mythology of war. Culling from the war literature of such writers as Homer and Shakespeare, Hedges argues that war mythology “… can be formed only by denying the reality of war, by turning the lies, the manipulation, the inhumanness of war into the heroic ideal.” [3]  As a war correspondent, Hedges has a great deal of primary experience of war. Yet he exposes the media’s complicity in perpetuating war mythology, arguing that “The blunders and senseless slaughter by our generals, the execution of prisoners and innocents, and the horror of wounds are rarely disclosed, at least during a mythic war, to the public.” [4]  Hedges thus effectively demonstrates how perfectly sealed and protected the truth behind war can be. This element of Hedges’ argument is further substantiated in the chapter titled “The Destruction of Culture.” Culture is easily corrupted to accommodate both the war myth and the need to forget the war reality, as demonstrated by Hedges’ assessment of post-war Germany, where it was “as if the war was just some bad, horrible dream from which everyone had just awoken and no one wanted to discuss.” [5]  The distortion of reality is welcome to those affected by war, for as long as one is protected from truth, one is protected from further pain. The climax of  War Is a Force That Gives Us Meaning  is Hedges’ philosophical appraisal of the reasons behind our collective thirst for war. Borrowing from Freud’s psychological explanation of human nature, Hedges underscores the opposing forces that drive humanity: the calling to create and the drive to destroy, the inclination to love and the proclivity to kill. [6]  In effect, Hedges offers to the reader the double-edged sword of realism, in which love is redemptive but war is inevitable. That Hedges quotes Reinhold Neibuhr in more than one instance in the book is telling. Hedges does not equate war’s inevitability with its morality; the culpability Hedges advocates is the culpability of varying shades of immorality. The difficulty with a book like Chris Hedges’ is its capacity to alienate those who most need to hear its message. Hedges is careful to differentiate soldiers fighting in mythic wars from the political authorities who sponsor mythic wars. Yet the public generally does not make this distinction, so the dismantling of patriotic propaganda could easily be likened to a lack of support for armed forces. The book could also easily be usurped by those on the progressive left. Hedges is quite apolitical in his critique; perhaps the greatest strength of the book is Hedges’ conviction that everyone—left or right, Serb or Croat, American or Afghani— participates in war mythology. “When you stop believing you stop going to war,” [7]  Hedges states confidently. The first step in the process of ceasing to believe in the myth is to understand the myth.  War Is a Force That Gives Us Meaning  is a book that makes evident that one man’s truth is more compelling than fifteen years’ worth of war’s myth.

       urlLink Paste Magazine :: Home    just picked up the new paste magazine; it's improved a lot in quality.  the magazine seems a little more polished in design and writing, and the cd selections are great.  just heard rilo kiley for the first time... and the new tift merritt song indicates that her sophomore album will follow  bramble rose  well.  paste has done really well with online music sales as well.  they make some mistakes but are gracious and expedient in rectifying any sticky situations.

      i suppose it's sort of strange to review one song of an album. but the song, performed live, deserves considerable mention. the song is great on  ohio  (2003); painful on  changes come  (2004).  the lyrics:   Changes come     Turn my world around I have my father's hand     I have my mother's tongue     I look for redemption in everyone I wanna wear your ring     I have a song to sing     It ain't over babe     In fact it's just begun Changes come     Turn my world around     Changes come     Bring the whole thing down I wanna have our baby     S    omedays I think that maybe     This ol' world's too fucked up     For any firstborn son There is all this untouched beauty     The light the dark both running through me     Is there still redemption for anyone Jesus come     Turn the world around     Lay my burden down     Turn this world around     Bring the whole thing down     Bring it down       the subtle shift from "changes come" to "jesus come" is chilling. it's almost as if the singer isn't completely sure she wants jesus to come; that even though she wants change, the enormity of the eschaton is a little too big. this song is begging for a frightening thing: the end of the world as we know it. given the context in which this song was written- in the wake of 9/11 and the cusp of a senseless war- the lyrics aren't all that extreme.  it strikes me as the polar opposite of mark twain's war prayer, a satire of the twisted religiousity of patriotism.  there's no assumption of righteousness, no false claim of god-on-our-side.  just pure lamentation.

      somewhat disappointing.  usually films that win for best screenplay (as  t.b.i . did at cannes in 2003) are genuinely great films; this one is not.  the characters seem a little too-roughly chiseled from overused cliches: the Prodigal Son, the Heroin Waif, the Emotionally Closed-Off Father.  instead of having believable traits and idiosyncracies, the characters are held in thrall to what their respective types would say or do.   nevertheless, there is some good stuff.  the father and son are predictably set up as opposites, but their differences are compelling, rooted in tensions of ideological import (socialism vs. capitalism, etc.).  it's fascinating to watch how these tensions manifest themselves in an ordinary yet painful situation, the experience of dying.  the father has his radical compatriots and the son has his money, and neither can purchase more time.  worth watching, despite its frustrating limitations.

      i've been meaning to buy a r. sexsmith album for a long time now, ever since i heard his version of "ships go out" on the tom t. hall tribute.  i bought  blue boy  used at the hollywood amoeba last weekend, and i've been listening to it at least twice a day since.  the songs are spoonfuls of nearly-perfect pop; the lyrics are sweet, frank, and clever-but-not-too-clever.  on the first track r.s. sounds a bit like rufus wainwright, but without the qualities that bug me about r.w.  the saddest and most beautiful song on the disc is "foolproof," which employs trumpets reminiscent of sarah harmer's sophisticated instrumentations.  r.s.'s vocals are stylish in an almost old-fashioned way, full of unexpected riffs and unscripted emotions.   the last time i fell for an album so quickly was over four years ago at the kent state university bookstore, when i happened upon a little album called  good dog bad dog  and immediately knew that i'd found my favorite band.   i've heard r.s.'s  retriever  is an excellent album as well, though i'm tempted to go back to his earlier work so as to not read the book backwards.
