      So. Expect this to be a very long and crazy entry, people. It's the 4 in the morning and I'm totally on a sugar high, yo. :D  Soooo, today...well, actually, yesterday, I went over to Trey's. Again. ^_^ That seems to be all I've been doing lately. Hm. OHHHH WELL. I like hanging out with him. :D So, anyway, I went over there at around 11:15 and woke him up. He didn't look too happy about it. o_0 Sorry, Trey. >_  We ended up hanging out in his room and watching TV and stuff until about 4 (among other things ;D) After he did some merit badge stuff we got ready to go to Hamilton Pool. WHEEEEEEE. Fun stuff. :D We stayed there for about two hours, most of that time consisting of us dunking eachother under the water. XD   After leaving around 6 Trey's mom decided to stop at McDonald's for food. I wasn't going to get anything, but Trey kinda forced me to because he thinks I never eat. O_O I do, just not until about 2 in the morning when I've realized I haven't eaten anything at all that day. XD So, yeah...Trey now thinks I'm an alien who only eats about once a month. Great. -_-'  We went back to his house to eat our food. But Nolan's friend who was over, took my food thinking it was his. Little fucker XD. So I ended up eating Trey's sandwich and Trey ended up eating Nolan's friend's nuggets...o_0 I told Trey he should eat his own burger, but he didn't want to. =/ Blahhhh.  I left his house at around 8 and got back home around 8:30. Since, you know, I live in fucking Texass now apparently. bvuieabivgubiergb. Blaahhh.  I got onto the computer immediately, since it's what my life revloves around pretty much. I started talking to Bruce, and somehow the topic of marriage came up and we ended up planning our two weddings for the next hour and a half. w00t, go losers! *waves flag*   Now, just because I feeeeel like it, I'm going to give you a basic outline of what I'd like my wedding to be like. ^_^  - Very classic/traditional. Though, I was wondering....what do atheists do for weddings? I mean...they mostly revolve around religion. Likeomgwtf. - Outdoors. Much prettier. ^_^ - Both my husband and I write our own vows.  - The floral stuff will consist of roses. Only roses. Red/white ones. XD - I want a long dress...but I don't want it to be too prissy, covered up, etc. I think I'd really like a strapless one with an uber long train and a really simple, but pretty veil. Like, a classic themed dress...but modern at the same time....that didn't make sense...*sigh* - Red Bride's Maid dresses - My dad better be there to give me away, or else I'm going to really depressed. =( I love my Dad too much, he better show up O_O - When we're walking out of the church, the people are throwing RICE, not blowing bubbles. Bubbles are lame. -_-' - We drive away in a horse drawn buggy ^_~  And then, of course, there's the RECEPTION! Party, baby. ^_~  - On a seaside pavillion (stole this from Bruce XD) - Lots of lights,  flowers , fountains, etc. Oh, and a lot of candles too. :P - As everyone's walking in, I'd like there to be like a chamber music group playing something like ball music. But, after they play a few pieces, we could play songs from our childhood, like..."It's Getting Hot In Here" or "Get Low" XDXDXD - We're gonna have a slide show, yo. Like filled with pictures of me and whoever my husband will be and us with our friends and when we were little and such. (also stolen from Bruce XD) - Top-notch food, only the best - A bar of course. What's a reception without crazy, drunk family making fools of themselves?! - HUGE cake. That way, after we cut it, it won't matter how much of it I stick in my husband's face XD - A professional photographer, of course - And then, after the guests are free to do what they want, we'll have a FIREWORKS SHOW! (ALSO stolen from Bruce XD)   Yup, that's my wedding in a nutshell. Not that any of you care or anything O_O. And of course, this is inferring that I actually find someone who would want to marry me. >_  Anyway, after me and Bruce finished planning our entire future(XD), Trey called and I talked to him for a few hours. ^_^ That's always enjoyable. =P  And now...I'm sitting here...writing this...singing. O_O   I'm really glad none of you can hear me right now. I'm a horrible singer. >_  -Alysia  P.S. Trey and I have been together for 3 months, today. :D  I love you, Trey. <3<3<3

      Trey came over yesterday for a few hours. My house is extremely lame/boring but I had a lot of fun. ^_^  As most of you know, today's Father's Day. It's probably gonna be pretty low key...that's how it usually is anyway. Card, present, maybe go out for dinner, etc.  Hm. I'm tired.  This post was pretty pointless. XD

      I went Trey's again yesterday. w00t! I got there at about 11:30 and didn't end up leaving until 8:50. So that's about...9 hours and 20 minutes? Wheeha! ^_^ It was hella fun, definitely enjoyable. Kelsey was there too as well until 1:30, but then she had to go cause she's going to Ireland. No fair. XD  Huggling is the coolest. You should try it out sometime. ;D  I love you so much, Trey. <3<3<3

      Yesterday I went to Golfland with Trey and Kelsey. ^_^ It was purdi fun. We were only there for about 2 hours, but it was still enyjoyable. :)  Afterwards I went over to Kelsey's house for the night and just hung out for a while, but Kelsey and I were starting to get restless and we both felt the need to get out of the house. Too bad her mom wouldn't give us a ride anywhere. It took quite a bit of convincing for her to even allow us to leave. -_- We were originally going to go see Stepford Wives with Trey, but his parents said the movie looked horrible and offered to just rent a movie and let us come over. We glady accepted. :P  We ended up renting The Others, which I had already seen, but I didn't mind seeing it again especially considering Trey and Kelsey hadn't seen it yet. Kelsey was really creeped out but the ending calmed her down a bit. XD We ended up leaving at about 11:30 and we just went back to Kelsey's.   We got back on the computer to talk with friends, but Kelsey ended up spilling her cranberry juice on the keyboard and messing it up. We tried draining it out, but it wouldn't work at all. >_  Today I just hung out with Kelsey until about 6. We just watched TV, swam, painted XD, and hung out. It was laidback, but still fun.   I feel like doing something exciting tomorrow. Tell me if you have any suggestions.    Edit: I feel like fucking shit. Great, just great.

      HAHA. Guess what I just noticed? I was watching Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, and you know that one scene where Hagrid is explaining Voldemort to Harry for the first time, and it shows a flashbck of Harry when he was a baby? Yes, well on Harry's sleeve you can see Blue from the children's show  Blue's Clues ! Not only was Blue's Clues not even invented when Harry was that young, but it's also purely American and Muggleish. >_  Anyway, while Kelsey and I were on the phone yesterday, we made a list of uber romantic things. (Which most guys would never do, but are still really sweet.) ^_^ It was kinda fun. :P Here, you can see too...  -Kiss in the rain. (Is that one not obvious yet? =P) -Pull a blanket out and just start counting the stars together. -Swinging on the swings at the park together. -You two are kissing outside and it just starts snowing. -Falling asleep together. (Not all that romantic, but still sweet)  Heehee. ^_^ I know, terribly girly and such, but I like 'em. :)  I went to Trey's today with Kelsey today at 11. We were gonna go over there at 8 to wake them up, but we couldn't get a ride that early. And plus...Trey didn't really like the sound of us coming over there so early just so he can wake up with us laying on top of him. >_  Ian and Michael were already over there from last night but Bruce had already left. It was pretty fun. ^_^ When we first got there the guys played DDR for a while (Me and Kelsey just watched >_  I love you, Trey. Much more than I could ever explain. :) <3<3<3

Haha, so I made some of my own  better  Life Goals. =P  - Be accepted into an Ivy League school - Maintain at least a 3.8 GPA throughout High School - Keep in touch with a large majority of my friends from Jr. High/High School throughout my life. - Learn HTML - Finally learn the guitar.  - Become fluent in another language, preferably Latin, French, or Japanese - Visit Italy, France, Japan, and London at least once. - Publish a book - Kiss in the rain.

      Well. I slept over at Melissa's on Friday. T'was fun stuff. We watched 3 movies in a row. Damn that wigga'. Haha. &nbsp; Trey came home. YAY. I missed him so much. :P I loooove you Trey.  &nbsp; I went over to his house on...Sunday. Maryann, Kelsey, and Ian came over too. Maryann is too cool. She made me a princess hat (with security tabs!) and gave me some sunglasses. She had pocky too. =0 That girl has cool running through her blood.  &nbsp; Trey came over yesterday. We didn't do much. I'm boring. =( &nbsp; He was supposed to come over today too. But my dad wouldn't let me do anything. What bullshit.  &nbsp; He's coming over tomorrow though. YAY. I can't see why'd he want to. >_ &nbsp; &nbsp; Yeah. That's it. &nbsp; &nbsp;

      Kelsey slept over last night. T'was fun stuff. We walked over to the mailbox to see if Trey had sent a letter yet. He did, so we sat in the middle of the sidealk to read it. We sat on my fence and ate popcorn for a while. We painted our nails. Mine are already chipping. Lame. Kelsey's came out cool though. They have polka dots. :D We watched the first half of Donnie Darko but then my Dad stole the TV from us. We walked over to Walmart to buy some icecream (yum). We watched Reno 911. And some other fun stuff that I can't think of right now.   Wheeeee.       I still miss Trey. He comes back Saturday though. YAYAYAYAYAY!

      Man. I haven't updated in a whiiiile.  So...I went to Trey's on Tuesday with Kelsey and Michael. T'was fun stuff. I went there pretty early...about 11ish and didn't end up leaving till 9:50. XD We just laid around, watching X-Files(Creepy! O_O) and such. A woman, as Kelsey puts it, was totally Invisi-raped. XD Nolan and his friend were being weird and dragging eachother around in sheets. Strange kids.  From Trey's I went over to my Girl Scout's leader's house because our troop was totally going to Magic Mountain. It was so damn fun. I got to ride on all the scary rollercoasters. =0 Man, I was so scared of one that I was actually hyperventilating and getting dizzy before I even got on it. XD it turned out to be a blast though. The only bad thing about the trip was the 8 hour bus ride there and back while trying to SLEEP. My back is killing me. =(   Yeah. Now I'm home.   I got my glasses. I look lame.

      Hm. Sorry for the lack of updates. My compy has been really slow and I haven't had time.   My lips healed. Yay. :D  I went to Trey's house again on Monday from like 10:30 to like...7. XD We ended up walking over to the mall for a few hours and got some Bawls. ^_^ We stopped by the park on our way back as well and then started walking over to Melissa's since I was gonna stay there for the night.   When we got there, Trey, Melissa, Lauren, Brittany, and I hung out on her front porch for a little while and then walked over to the Greenbelt for a little while. At like 8:30 Melissa's mom drove Trey home and then we got on the compy for a little while and then watched some movies. Wheeeeee. Fun stuff. ^_^  On Tuesday, Melissa, Trey, Joe and I went over to Sunsplash and ended up meeting Marcel and Kohl there as well. Overall, it was pretty damn fun. :D I'd definitely like to do it again.   And then today...I have an eye appointment. I better not need glasses. That would suck ass. -_- I'd look horrible in glasses. XD
