      Yeah, while perusing late-night television early this morning, I saw a minute-long commercial for friggin' Christmas music. Now, like any red-blooded American (be you Jewish, Christian, Muslim, etc.), I love the Christmas time. It's cold out, you get an excuse to sit inside and drink, people in general are more open for one-night stands as they've realized that the mask they put towards the world is in fact turning them into a lonely, pitiful shell of a person, your mom bakes awesome cookies, and all that. But already! It's bad enough that the tiny mall in the semi-rural town I live has had their Elder-Beerman Xmas Blowout Spectacular store open since mid-August.  Also, I am going to Las Vegas tomorrow. I'm looking forward to it; I generally feel more relaxed the further west I go.   At work last night, a few of us were shooting the shit, as financially frustrated twentysomethings are wont to do while working second shift at a small-town newspaper. And I'd like to say that, from this shooting tha shiznit, I came up with a handy rule that definitely applies to my life and may apply to yours: The Rule Of Two.  That is, throughout my life, I've always found out that beautiful, cool women wanted me fully two years after the situation would have been conducive to us being together. Like, two years after I graduated from high school, I was told that a bunch of ladies I would have loved to entertain with off-key renditions of "My Girl" and make terrible mix-tapes for wanted desperately to go out with me. OK, maybe not desperately, but...you know.  So I figure now's the time I find out about all the women who wanted me throughout college. And if any one of them happen to be that woman who worked at the Dairy Mart, then goddamnit.  I guess the lesson for today is: When you see a good thing, go for it. Great success requires great risk, or something like that.    Happy Sweetest Day, everybody. Yeah, it's totally a Hallmark holiday. But so's Flag Day.

      The hell? Here goes nothing. I'm bored, it's a rainy day, so why not publish my thoughts so that the world (more likely some other bored person) can read them, I say.  I got a weird look from a fella while doing laundry in my apartment building today. It actually wasn't so much of a weird look as a sheepish look, like he fucked me over and stole information about my checking account without telling me and now he feels bad about it. But I believe he lives in the apartment right next to the laundry room, so that must be a burden I just don't know about. Imagine coming back to your house/apartment/tar-paper shack from work, just wanting to take a nap or something, and some smoothie decides, right at 4 in the afternoon, to do his laundry a few feet from your head.  Well, as thrilling as this has been, I must bid you adieu for now.  Be good to yourself and others.

      Happy Thanksgiving, everybody. Or what's left of it, anyway. And when I say "everybody," I mean myself, possibly the only person in the world who reads this thing (I haven't told anyone about it yet; I'm so good at being coy).  I can't wait to bust out old holiday chestnuts like:   A Very Rotten Christmas  by John Lydon and, possibly, PIL.   Do You Have A Gay Cousin  by Johnny Mathis.   Give Me Crack and Anal Sex: The Signature Holiday Collection  by Leonard Cohen.  and, of course,   Oh Christ: Another Fucking Christmas Album  by Mannheim Steamroller.  Wow, I'm so witty. I could write any number of sub-par Onion articles or wallpaper my bathroom with McSweeney's rejection e-mails.  Anyhoo, I hope the flavor of the season infects you all quickly and painlessly, like a flesh-eating bacteria. I cooked my own Thanksgiving dinner, complete with a small boneless and headless turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes (let's just say I had a little trouble with those), and green beans. For dessert: idiot-proof cookies. MTV2 seems to be having some sort of all-day hip-hop marathon, and it's pretty nice relaxing on the couch, having Toure and Queen Latifah tell me why Nas is better than Jay-Z, and why they're both better than the Beastie Boys. Everyone loves bitching about lists.  But Thanksgiving isn't about lists or Run-DMC or that terrible mess you made in the kitchen with the cranberry sauce. It's about going to sleep early so you can get to Wal-Mart at 5:45 a.m. to get that crazysexycool deal on air mattresses. OK, it's about giving thanks. I'm giving thanks that I work neither New Year's Eve or New Year's Day this year/next year. Not quite sure what's going on this year, but one thing I do know: I will wake up on someone's couch with a massive hangover. Probably.   My personal best to you and yours this holiday season. Like Frank Sinatra said,  "I just wish someone would try to hurt you so I could kill them for you."    Indeed!

      Huh. I always seem to write my "blog" thing on Saturdays. Why this is, I'm not sure. Perhaps it is the excitement I feel in my bone marrow over this being the last day in my work week. Man, I'm a copy editor; that previous sentence should have gone better. Oh well, better to soldier on into the future unafraid than cower in the past, surrounded by things I cannot change.  So, I'm in one of my smoking phases. I smoked pretty heavily from the ages of 16 to 18, thanks to bad influences, a need to rebel, the local 7-11, and, of course, my own poor judgment. I quit mainly because my father died from lung cancer when I was young and I was tired of the daily grind of getting my habit past me ma. But the past few years I've smoked at least one pack of cigarettes every six months or so. It's a good system; by the time I'm done with the pack, I'm reminded why I don't do it anymore, that is, my body feels like shit. But, let's be honest: Smoking makes you look really cool. Unless it's 2 a.m. and 30 degrees out and you're smoking on the patio of your apartment building because you don't want your apartment to smell like cigarette smoke. Then it makes you look extra cool.  And smoking breaks give one valuable time to reflect on life in general. Like, I wonder what happened to that girl I had a crush on my freshman year in college. You know, the one who lived in the same quadrangle? Of course you do. She was my favorite type: mousy, long brown hair, kind of looked like a librarian. Damn the fates that never lead us to the same contemporary American literature class. I let her borrow my umbrella once.  Going to see Guided By Voices tomorrow in the Grog Shop in Cleveland. Nice little rock place. Guided By Voices shows make me tired in the best possible way.  What else? I had a wonderful time back home. Got crazy marshmallow in Bowling Green as usual, danced like a hellion at Retro Night at Uptown. Holy Christ, can I dance. Men, come on, let's not hold back on this one. Women love to see us dance.  Brought my old Nintendo Entertainment System from back home. Dear Lord, please let it still work. I needs my Super Mario 3.  OK, have fun and take care of yourself.

      I'm going home tonight. Again. Well, once every six weeks isn't that bad. I suppose that as we get older, the tether gets looser. And it's not like I don't love seeing my family; I do. But, like many newly-charged young-uns, I have the twin desires of living near my family and living far enough away that I feel like some sort of new life is taking place. Who will win? Cagematch battle to the end!  And it's not like I don't like this little town, but, as I've said to friends over and over, driving 30 miles to the nearest decent bookstore blows. I'm easy. All I need in a town is a good record store or two and a nice bookstore.   I also wouldn't mind having some extra money. I'm hardly at the poverty line, but for the last few months I've been so broke I can't afford a haircut. But I'm kind of enjoying how it's growing out. I'll keep you posted on that.   What else? Still recovering from the glory that was vacation. Making a mental list of what will go on the year-end mix CD that I will try to send to friends, family and other assorted loved ones.  I'm wearing a bathrobe right now. I'm thinking it's pretty stylish. Come on, how many other 24-year-olds do you know who wear a nice bathrobe on a regular basis? More proof that I am the world's sole perfect man.

      The teeming millions can stop holding their breath now. I am back from vacation.  (Side note: The ads at the top of the page often seem to have something to do with Judy Collins. Why this is, I don't know. I'm not complaining; I have absolutely nothing against Mrs. Collins, either personally or professionally. It's simply curious.)  I flew out to Las Vegas almost two weeks ago. After a few days partying and whatnot, my sister and I drove from Sin City to San Antonio, Texas, over the course of five days, making a few detours along the way. This was the first time in my life that I gave the American southwest a close look, and I have to say that I was impressed. You don't have to spread this around, but it may end up being the single best vacation I have ever taken. But, officially, it was also my first, this being the first paid vacation of my professional life. So take that how you will.  Some thoughts:  Las Vegas: Wow. Much like New York City, the simple act of the cab taking you from the airport to downtown gets your pulse racing. Everything you've heard and/or read is true. I'm not much of a gambler, so I took great advantage of the ridiculous buffets and the single most liberal law on open containers that I've encountered in North America. When was the last time you went to a swanky hotel bar and brought along your own personal 24 oz. can of Budweiser? Pure class.  Hoover Dam: Damn. If you ever feel the need to commit suicide in a dramatic fashion, you should probably do it here. Few guard railings and one picturesque scenescape equal one memorable ending of a life.  The Grand Canyon: Holy balls. Pictures and films don't do it justice. It's really one of those things that everybody has to see to experience. (Obviously. How else would you experience it? Geez, it's early.) Probably the most stunning thing I've ever seen. That and the first time I saw a girl naked.  Flagstaff, AZ: Nice. How people live in a place like this and don't constantly get into car wrecks by staring at the beautiful scenery is beyond me. Gorged myself at the Sizzler. The same day you see the Grand Canyon, one kind of has to eat a lot to try to dispel all of one's disbelief and sheer drunkenness on nature.  Sedona, AZ: Nice arts community, from what I'm told. I primarily just wandered the main street and waited for my sister to buy some earrings for our mother. More wonderful views than you can shake a stick at.  Phoenix, AZ: Really just drove through this town, although it seemed like the pit of hell. Seriously, it was late afternoon in late October and it was 105 degrees. Note to old people: California is much nicer. That is, when there aren't earthquakes or raging wildfires.  Tucson, AZ: Cool college town. Got lost navigating the streets of greater Tucson. Ended up hanging out in a nifty bar near the university on Thursday night after my sister visited some uber-sleazy Internet cafe. Waited an hour and a half to hear the songs I picked on the jukebox. I'm sure everyone was startled by my good taste and secretly wanted to meet and have sex with me. Got hit on by some nice college ladies. I have to beat the women away with the same stick I used to shake at the nice scenery in Sedona.  New Mexico: Breathtaking scenery, although we mainly just stopped at rest areas and gas stations along Interstate 10.  Um...Van Horn, TX, I think: West Texas town in the middle of nowhere. Dead on a Friday night, as the local high school football team's game was out of town. Pizza Hut for that ass. Drove out some county road for ten miles and looked at the stars. With absolutely no light interference, one can see literally thousands of stars with the naked eye, plus the thin misty line of the Milky Way. It would have been romantic had I not been with my sister, for cryin' out loud.  Austin, TX: We were making good time and my sister suggested that, instead of heading to San Antonio, we head to Austin to party on Saturday night. We did just that, and drove through some random incredibly-German-influenced small towns to get there. Ate great sushi on 6th Street and drank the night away at bar after bar after bar. Ended up at a "Generic" blues bar with an interesting men's restroom. As it was the last Saturday in October and therefore the end of Daylight Savings Time, the large female singer of the band had this comment: "You know what I'm gonna do with that extra hour? I'm gonna PAR-TAY!" Let me tell you, I think she had a point. I also fell in love with a sax player at one of the earlier bars, one that kind of looked like the lead singer of the Donnas.  San Antonio, TX: The last destination. Hung out there for a few days, and continued my streak of eating and drinking way too much. Saw the Alamo, did the Riverwalk, bought a t-shirt that says "Don't Mess With Texas." Tried to mentally avoid the fact that my vacation was quickly dwindling. But it did, on Wednesday morning when I left San Antonio International Airport, connected in Atlanta, and came home to a chilly northern Ohio afternoon, a day when I had to work.  Oh well. Some good things come to an end.        R.I.P. Fred "Rerun" Berry, Rod Roddy, and Elliott Smith.

      Hey there folks. This is just a quick update to wish everyone out there a wonderful holiday season. My family screwed me over yet again this year, as I got absolutely no Hanukkah presents. We aren't Jewish, but I keep telling them that's no excuse.  Anyway, have a fun Christmas or Kwannza or Ramadan or whatever the hell you believe in. And if you don't believe in anything at all, just have a nice vodka tonic in front of the fireplace for me.  I'm updating this thing right now from the Way Public Library, so if the next posting says something about me being gay and how "LINKIN PARK RULEZ," please ignore it. I am not and they don't.  Have a wonderful holiday season, everyone. Now, where's that damn Great Pumpkin?

      I keep getting these e-mails from Paris Hilton. Not those ones about her, mind you, though I do get plenty of those. But these e-mails actually list Ms. Hilton as the one who sent the (I'm sure) well-written missive imploring me not to keep avoiding that pesky membership renewal letter from Amnesty International. I care about the downtrodden and all, but I think my sister's hankering for a new Ipod this year. Maybe she should side-step Santa and go straight to Jesus with that request.  Saw the laundry fellow again. Cheers, chum. We bachelors are indeed creatures of habit. Sad, depraved habit.  I have to tell you the truth: This town is wearing on me a little bit. It's not that I'm not pleased with the way my life is going (note to self: you will never meet Elizabeth Hurley), but I'm a suburban boy at heart. This rural life is turning me into a hermit faster than you can say "I got all the episodes of The Adventures of Pete and Pete on EBay." I didn't, by the way. I mean, when Canton looks like the pinnacle of civilization, maybe there's something wrong. Canton is a fine town, though. And it's not like I live in west Texas or anything, hundreds of miles from anything remotely resembling a cool coffee shop. But I don't drink coffee, so I don't know.  I mean, I should feel lucky I have a job, as some people I graduated from college with are presumably still living with their parents or working at a job that is wildly at odds with the topic they majored in. Maybe this all goes back to the advice my Lithuanian grandmother gave me when I was a child. She said, "Boy, your 20s will blow like a whale." God bless her, she was right. A shocking amount of choices sometimes leads to paralysis, but only for navel-gazers like me.   Eh, maybe I need a bath. I bought some Mr. Bubble the other day and that just might do the trick. Remember to eat your vegetables, go for a nice long walk every once in a while, and don't miss "Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer," tonight at 8 on CBS.

      Poor neglected 'blog. I hope this thing doesn't turn out like that ill-fated Lead Belly website I started my freshman year in college. I have to dig out that address and see if there's still tumbleweeds blowing through it.  Much change in my life since last I posted: I'm engaged! That's right! Phil proposed (finally) and we're getting married sometime in 2019. Mom's real excited and I'm sure Papa would have been, had he not been killed in that tragic wheelbarrow accident last year.  No, actually, I'm still here and doing what comes naturally to me, like avoiding work and eating too much chip dip.   Went to Cincinnati this weekend to see my friend Kelli. I'm constantly surprised by the hip enclaves of the cities I've visited over the years. When one hears the words "Cleveland," "Pittsburgh," or "Cincinnati," for instance, one doesn't necessarily think "cool." But yet here these little neighborhoods are, with their mind-blowingly good burrito shops, their cramped record stores with surly clerks twice your age, their random karaoke bars frequented by people who have nothing better to do on a Sunday than dress up in New Kids On The Block t-shirts, get drunk, and applaud one's style of singing. "Oh Darling" by the Beatles, by the way. Oh yeah. Kicked the shit out of that one and left it unconscious on the floor.  I still purchase (and, um, burn) CDs at a far greater frequency than I have time to listen to them. Or perhaps my methods of scheduling time blow. Do normal people schedule their days off around syndicated episodes of "The Simpsons"? I'd appreciate some feedback. I also feel weird about listening to music I really like on work days, as if the stench of work will somehow corrupt my love for said music.   And, like every other person with too much time on their hands, I'm a bit addicted to Friendster. I can stop whenever I want to, I just don't want to right now. What's better than judging people entirely by the way they look?  Well, have fun everybody. Dance fast, unless you've had too much to eat or drink.

      Greetings there, folks. Another holiday season has come and gone, with all the tribulations, misinterpreted gestures and drunken debauchery that they imply. I'd be happy to wish those things farewell until the end of the year, but who are we kidding, right?   Oh, I'm not that bitter, I'm just having a little fun. I did my first little bit of exercise today after what must have been two and a half straight weeks of sitting on the couch and watching "Simpsons" DVDs. Yikes. I feel like passing out whenever I walk up a flight of stairs. Time to get back into the grind, they say, but I love those times of year where you're not sure what day it is for a fortnight.   Seriously, those "Simpsons" DVDs are a great investment. Um, what else? Chicken fills me up really fast. I buy so many CDs that I don't have time to listen to them all. Spending New Year's Eve at some random rich person's house in suburban Columbus is pretty cool, even though your friend rightly chastised you for trying to drink a beer in her car on the way there. Sorry, for Christ's sake. We're all still young, so we don't need to worry about our futures more than is necessary. That "Lord of the Rings" movie is pretty cool, but I laugh every time I pick up one of the books somewhere and read the word "hobbit." Dorks!  They say it's going to be cold the next few days, so remember to bundle up.

      Happy Friday the 13th to y'all. I believe today is my friend Ken's birthday. Ken, you're not reading this, but happy birthday.  Went to New York for my 25th birthday. I feel so wealthy when I say that, like I'm so rich I can jet off to the city for a long weekend. But I feel less rich when I get back to town and see that I have 12 dollars in the bank account for the next two weeks. Ah, but it was worth it, seeing Norah Jones in some high-priced Italian restaurant, getting a fucking mind-blowing gyro from Cinderella Falafel in the East Village, and looking like I know what I'm looking for in some pretentious record store.  I believe Chris Rock said it best when complaining about Black History Month: "It's the shortest, crappiest month of the year," or something like that. True. February is my least favorite month, one skullfuck of a month that takes much and offers little in return. Most people tend to profess love for the month they're born in, but not me. I'd have much rather been born in May. My original due date was Valentine's Day, though. I wonder what my romantic life would have been like had I been born that day. Ah, but for the grace of et cetera.  Got my new driver's license yesterday. Lord, what a fascinating little world Internet publishing is. Do you really care I got my new driver's license yesterday? Anyway. I've had great luck with my two previous licenses, but I think it ran out with this one. Forgot to shave, gave a big, dumb-ass smile for the camera, was intimidated by the two ridiculously gorgeous women my age at the BMV. And they don't take credit cards! There goes my bowling cash for the week.  OK, have fun, you two people reading this. Keep watching the skies, but don't forget to watch where you're walking.

      Yikes. It's been exactly a month since I last updated this thing. My heartfelt apologies to those who felt deprived without their semi-monthly view into the emotionally twisted world of, well, me. I only work four days a week, but one thing in life I've noticed is that the less one works, the less free time one has. An odd equation, and probably an ultra-bourgeois one at that. Shit, I used the word "bourgeois" in a sentence.  But, you know, the more free time you have, the more free time you have to do stupid shit, like watch VH1's "The Fabulous Life of Jimmy Walker" or Garth Brooks biographies on CMT. Although, don't be frontin' on "Mythbusters" on the Discovery Channel. Pure gold, it is. That's right, I haven't read a novel in months but I never miss "King Of The Hill," on every weeknight at midnight. Oh well, I'm 25. I figure I don't really have to grow up for another 10 years or so.  In the ways of music, I can enthusiastically recommend the stylings of The Darkness, a.k.a. the band that has that fucked-up space video that's constantly played on MTV2. Black shuck! That dog don't give a fuck!  Wow, enough with the profanity. This culture is quickly becoming a den of sin. First they trick you with a breast at a halftime show, and the next thing you know there's hardcore pornography on the Cartoon Network instead of "Dexter's Laboratory." Although the plots of most hardcore pornographic movies are 10 times more interesting than the umpteenth Scooby-Doo movie featuring Don Knotts or Tim Conway, complete with laugh track. I'm sorry, a laugh track? It's a fucking cartoon! OK, again with the swearing.   (Also, I mean no hatred toward either Don Knotts or Tim Conway; they are both fantastic comedians who probably deserve everything they have.)  I'm going to go listen to music now and perhaps read a self-help book. Hope everything is well with you and yours. Spring starts a week from today, so that's something to dig, fully.

      Speakin' as a child of the '80s...  I'm not sure what's up with the recent resurgence in 1980s musical culture. I mean, Morrissey is back, Prince is back, even the friggin' Pixies are back. It's happening with political culture, too. We have a dimwit frontman in the Oval Office, and the American people are being lied to day in and day out and lap it up like a mongrel dog lapping up a small pool of Miller High Life on the ground after their alcoholic owner passed out on the front lawn after a particularly toll-taking house party. Remind me never to get political again on this blog thing.  Other than that, I guess, it's spring, and that's good. Ah, my favorite season. I seem to remember complaining about the town I live in about six months ago or so; yes, it's true, I am trying to leave, but it is damn nice living out in the country when the weather is gorgeous. It makes me forget (almost) that there's no decent place to get a gyro up in this beeotch.  The front room of my apartment has a distinct stench of cigarette smoke, and I don't know where it's coming from. The space below my apartment is a semi-abandoned office, and I don't smoke, so it can only be the vagrants who choose to live above me, their tufts of inhalable death wafting down to mess with my sensitive lungs. Oh well, I just open a window.  Have fun, everybody. I may try to update this thing more often. Famous last words, I know.

      Dear Lord, I think I check Friendster much more often than I check my online banking account. Maybe that's the reason I had three overdrafts a few months ago. Oh, what the hell, I'm just like Mary Poppins, roaming from town to town (in a tiny Honda instead of with an umbrella), helping adults to peace the fuck out and children to discover their true talents, like getting me another beer, G-ddamnit!  Yikes, that's harsh. But it's spring now, and my blood is flowing. I may go for a bike ride in six minutes, but I really need to see what the weather's like outside. I may have messed my bike up pretty badly a few days ago, navigating a steep curb with less grace than usual and popping my rear tire out of alignment. So every time I lean my weight to the left side and pedal over two miles an hour, the tire treads ram into the frame, making a quite undignified RRRRR sound. And trust me, I am a man that likes attention, but not the attention of hassled onlookers around town trying to figure out why my bike is making the exact same sounds as a mid-sized jet plane.  Oh well. It's now almost two minutes until my bike ride. Ride to live, live to ride, my friends. Hope all is well with you and yours.

      Bitching helps.  My air conditioning has been out for two and a half weeks. I told my landlord about it, he got in touch with a local heating/cooling company, and they came out to see what the deal was. They needed to order parts. It took 8 days.   So the company said: Look, we can come on Thursday at around 10:30. I said cool. 10:30 came and went. 11 came and went. And so on until I call the company around one, slightly pissed off. The guy was on a call that went longer than expected. Can he come around 2? Fine. 2 rolls around, 2:30 rolls around, 3 rolls around, still nothing, not even a phone call to say, "Hey, sorry we're late."  I call up the company pretty pissed-off. They can't come Friday. I won't be home from Sunday until Thursday. So they have to reschedule for next fucking Friday, almost 4 weeks to the day my a/c went out.  I call my landlord in a respectful but obviously pissed-off manner and tell him about my "ordeal." He says that's too bad. I ask him if I can get some sort of discount for next month's rent. Silence on the other end of the phone. He's obviously getting upset. He says, let's talk after the Memorial Day weekend. I say fine, thank you, have a good day. I go to work pissed-off at the world, my apartment, the fact that I'm young, attractive, witty, articulate and that I've been living in the middle of fucking nowhere for almost two years. I hate everything.   I get to work. I vent to co-workers. They give sympathy (or at least feign it) and offer helpful hints on how to deal with the situation. The whole deal wasn't really my landlord's fault, they point out; he was helpful from day one. It's really the company's deal. I feel like an asshole, think about calling my landlord back at 11:00 at night to try to clarify my icy opinions of earlier in the day.  So I get home after work. Message on my machine from the heating company: Yeah, your landlord called us (probably all sorts of pissed off because, 1, I asked if I could pay less money for rent next month in exchange for no a/c in an apartment with shitty air flow and, 2, he's a short guy, and short guys get really mad really fast). Let us know what time is good tomorrow to come install your new a/c.   I rejoice. Bitching in a calm manner helps. I feel like the social activist of my own little hemisphere, that is, my brain. Do you care? Probably, no,  definitely  not. But whether it's a fucked-up a/c unit, a boss giving you shit about a project you had nothing to do with, or just plain assholes in your life, it's always important to express your thoughts and feelings. Now, your first thoughts and feelings may not be the ones you want to tell everybody, so think about them for a little while.   That's it, I guess. In some ways, the little, stupid victories sometimes count for as much as the big ones.  But, as for tomorrow, I'm not holding my breath.

      So I spend my free time relaxing, visiting with loved ones, writing people whom I haven't written to in a blue moon? No. I spend my free time making anagrams of the names of musicians and rock and roll groups.   Actually, I don't spend a heck of a lot of time doing it. I was bored today and decided to come up with some to get my mind off the fact that it's 85 degrees in my apartment. I know, I know: The professionals have been here and it should be fixed by the end of the week.   Here you go:    Ryan Adams' "Love Is Hell":   Ray Vole? He ill, damn ass.     Guided By Voices:   Bed? Yes, Vic Guido.     Polly Jean Harvey:   A love yel'n harpy, J.     Morrissey:   MOR? Yes, sir!     William Oldham:   Lad wim? A ho mill.     The Pixies:   I, sex pit? Eh.     The Smashing Pumpkins:   M: Get his shins, map, punk     The Velvet Underground:   G: V.V.V., he end Tent Lover Rd.  Well, they can't all be gold. Two that haven't worked out yet are Norah Jones and Tom Waits. Maybe if I found out their middle names...

      Man. It is damn hot up in this sheezy. My air conditioning's been out for a week and a half. They may be coming to replace a part today, they may not, meaning it wouldn't be fixed until Monday. Well, shit.   But I guess it's not like I'm dying or anything. It's just that this apartment has absolutely no air flow when the weather is friggin' nice, so just imagine it when the weather sucks.  Boo hoo. There are people starving while I write this.  I'm tired. Another fascinating post.

      "King of the Hill" is being pre-empted by NASCAR. This blows. Who in their right mind finds watching cars drive around and around in a circle over and over again entertaining? Probably the same type of people who like watching small men hit horses with sticks so they'll run faster. Although the life of a stud must be nice. It's being a gigolo, but it's accepted, at least by most people.  And it's not that I can really hold anything over my redneck NASCAR brethren. I seem to remember that I've made a night of Miller High Life and a videocassette of "Robocop" once or twice in my life.   This is the first Sunday I've had completely to myself in quite a while. The past six weeks have found me driving back to my northwest Ohio hometown more times than I can frankly accept. It's nice to do laundry for free, though. And I still have a few friends in college, so I can technically still hang out with college kids. I don't want to eventually turn into one of those 40-year-old guys who still hangs around college parties, trying to get free vile keg beer and a little bit of 19-year-old tit. Those guys always bugged me when I was in school.   This time back in Bowling Green was complete debauchery, as usual. (Great. Now everybody who reads this thinks I party all the time. It's not true, honest. I probably party about as much as you do.) Some things probably remain better unsaid, or unwritten at least. I hope I'm allowed back into C-Mo's apartment in this lifetime.  Ah, May, you bawdy wench, you're here already, and it's 40 degrees out! Thanks a lot, God! Again, this has been (up to this point) a nice relaxing day, filled with CDs, pizza and hopefully an episode of "The Simpsons" or two in a little bit. Sometimes our days are so full that a day like this is exactly what's needed. Rest, relaxation, rocking out. My three Rs, if you will.  OK, this is getting stupid. Have fun, my brothers and sisters.

      Yeah, so, I got offered the job, but I turned it down because the work itself seemed hellish. It would have meant doing about 200% of what I do at my current job, plus the workspace seemed like it was the neglected back room of an anarchist bookstore.   It was damn hard turning it down, as it met almost every single one of my criteria for my hopeful next job: It was near a bigger city and it paid more money. However, it was a much smaller place. That plus the workload gave me a sign to stay where I am and try to improve on what I'm doing. But, damn. I mean: Damn.    I've been thinking recently about my high school days. It's been a little over seven years since I've graduated, and I'm trying to think how I've changed.   I was a pretty big asshole for much of my time from the years 14 to 18, and I think I've become a better person. I've also gained about 70 pounds (I think; I don't weigh myself religiously) since the day I graduated. I don't get self-conscious about that fact at all really, unless I run into people I literally haven't seen for years back home. But I'm more normal now, as all the drugs I took in high school no doubt contributed to my razor-thinness.   It seems to me that if you do well in high school (and by I mean "do well," you can substitute whatever you consider "doing well" in high school), it tends to define you, and if you don't do well, it tends to propel you. I fall somewhere in the great vastness between those two goalposts. Was I treated badly in high school? Rarely. Was I popular? Kind of. Did I know the majority of women I knew back then wanted me? No, not until years later, hearing drunken confessions in scuzzy bars in the town I went to college.  I so rarely see people from that time in my life that it's hard to come to any concrete conclusions, though. There are a few people from my high school on Friendster, and they seem to be well-adjusted and still attractive. But what about those phantom friends, those enigmatic enemies, that one girl I went out with for a year and a half that I have no conscious desire to be with but still, once in a blue moon, actually dream about?  Ah hell, as the fella says. It's late and I'm venting my tired spleen. I'm not sure why I still do this blog thing. I write embarrassing stuff on it and the few friends and family that read it can reflect on my, truthfully, untroubled mind. Perhaps this will be incredibly edifying reading when I'm 70.  Have fun, everybody. If I don't get in touch before the July 4th weekend, have a good one. Be careful with those fireworks. And stay at the grill when you're cooking your food, fer Chrissakes.

      Hell. Smoking blows. Why do I keep buying cigarettes? It's like sticking your mouth on a fucking exhaust pipe. Great. Another blog entry informed by sickness.  I have a job interview in 13 hours, the second at one place in three days. Things are looking OK, pretty much. It would entain moving from here to the metropolitan Cleveland area. So that would be cool. The job might be a little harder, though. But it would pay more. But it's important (and when I give general advice I'm usually talking to myself) not to get ahead of oneself. In my mind I'm already looking for apartments in Shaker Heights, but I have to remind myself that any number of things could happen tomorrow and they might not get back to me for weeks.   To hell with it. That really should be the motto for this thing. To hell with it. There.

      Hi, my name's Rob, and I like to get melodramatic about things that break in my apartment. I also like sandwiches and bubble baths, although I don't think I've taken a bubble bath in more than 10 years.  I think I'm sick. Not seriously, but I have a sore throat and I am really tired. So this sucks. Or maybe it's because I stopped smoking today in order to be vice-free for a family get-together next week. To hell with it. (The notion of me being sick, not the anticipated family deal.)  I'd like to stay up long enough to watch the copy of "Goldeneye" I rented from Blockbuster. I was also recommended on the quality of the lone James Bond film starring George Lazenby, so I'll have to look into that as well.  I'd like to go to my deathbed knowing that I slept with a number of famous women. But, as of now, the few and proud women who have done me the honor of sleeping with me have not achieved any sort of noteworthy fame. Yes, they've gone on to relative social stature among their own communities as young mothers, travel agents and graduate students, but not any sort of cover-of-People fame. But perhaps I set my standards too high.  Hope all is well with you and yours. Take care.

      No one cares about your band And how many concerts have you planned? How many releases have you manned? What on earth cries for this demand?  You wouldn't care if your "art" was panned From The New York Times to India land You'd just think, "Hey, my work's not canned. No esteemed judger can 'ere have me banned.  All of my work is the cry of one man Against hypocrisy's flames I won't fan." All right, keep going, but your work is all bland Pale and fuming while&nbsp;true work's&nbsp;strong and tanned.  Only your friends will give you a hand And everyone else waits for the headlining band Feel you're one in a million, true underground man, But you're&nbsp;nothing at all, alone and unmanned.  &nbsp;  (Copyright 2004 by Bob Sz.)  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      What did you wear? What did you do? Why'd you leave all the doors with one loose screw?  Did you have kids? Were you alone? What did you possibly do to have five jacks for a phone?  There's a stain on the wall, I see it right here. It's oval in shape, the shade of light beer.  Life's fairly long and some is quite simple. Here, some carpet is burnt, arranged in a dimple.  You prob'ly had cats. You prob'ly were old. You didn't leave this place for weeks when it was cold.  We move through our lives, a trail of heaven and hell in our wake, and I wonder: Just what's that smell?    (Copyright 2004 by Bob Sz.)

      Marlon Brando's dead. He was 80 years old.   It's kind of reassuring that a man who took so poor care of his body for so long lived to be 80. It makes me feel a little bit better about the future.     Have fun.
