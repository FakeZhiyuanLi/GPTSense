      I don't know what the deal is, but lately all my chokers (necklaces) have been malfunctioning. My most favor-right, a tan intertwined rubber one, lost its clip a few months back. I kept it because I am thinking I can get it fixed for $5 ... though I have yet to do anything to it just yet. The second one, a beautiful one I brought while in NY the second time, from a beautifully complected Kenyan man, had short strings and yet, my thick-necked ass put it on ANYway and being the single, alone, no one to call my own female I am, I had no one to undo the knot and therefore had to cut myself out of it. It was quite humorous after getting over the "OMG! I might have to wear this choker for the rest of my life!" fear. So that one also needs to go to the shop. Problem is, finding the type of string to match the one already applied to the choker ... which prolly won't happen. We'll see. Most recently, my one with the suede ties snapped in the front! WTF?   There's a festival going on this weekend where I'm sure they will have African jewelry ... however, the problem lies in also needing groceries. Hmmm ... buy beautiful African art and jewelry or healthy food and sustenance? This will be a hard one. I've been anticipating going to this festival for the past two years, but something always came up or happened -- so I'm definitely GOING ... if I don't buy anything I'll slap myself around until NEXT summer.   I've had most of this jewelry forever, and jewelry is like underwear and socks, every few years you need to renew your stash. But, if you read the previous post (which you probably didn't because no one reads my blog ... and I'm OK with that) you know that I need to get on my shit as far as my eating habits go. Maybe I can trim down my grocery list to food that will last for the next couple weeks till payday and use the rest for African artifacts. Sounds reasonable enough.   I just LOVE being broke! Yay! Punk ass. ... *sigh* sorry ya'll ... a brief moment of frustration. I'll have a happy story to tell later. I'll make it good.   Peace.  ~*RBG*~

      Last night I was slapped with a rude awakening. My skinny jeans barely fit! They were muy uncomfortable.   Most recently I have been hella depressed here being away from my family and without companionship, and I am guessing the Mickey Ds fries and deliberatley buyin the full of fat Hidden Valley Ranch to accompany my veggies instead of the low-fat option, that I was buying when I was more  disciplined, has come back to do war on my thighs.   I blame my father's side of the family. All of his sisters  are built like horses in the ass and hips. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate my junk in the trunk, but I also know my limitations.   I realized after standing in front of my body mirror with nothing but a smile on that I am still not satisfied. I'm going running today. Dammit.   ~*RBG*~

      how tomorrow is pay day, yet my money is already being spent.   *sigh*  WTF?! Just wanted to share *goes back to writing checks*.  And please don't ask me why I still write checks in this day and age of Internet. I have ALL the checks. I am only on my first book of my second box. They've got to be used, dammit. lol  ~*RBG*~

      A funny thing happened on my way to sleep. I free styled a poem! My block is over! YAY! I'm going to write today!   I went to bed incredibly early last night, I finished twisting my hair at about 7:30-ish, and then watched some TV (including Duane Martin and his lips) and then at about nine I laid down. I was planning on picking up the phone and bothering some people when all of a sudden I was asleep. I give credit to the rain. Rain makes me feel two ways: sleepy is one of them. The other is NC17. *blush*   Any who, I woke up to my blinds shuffling, the rain was gettin' down, there was lightning all over the place and the wind made my blinds play music. And all of a sudden I felt like poetry. I lay on my back and out came these words. I was up for another hour; scribbling free words and then I picked up Nikki G. and read myself back to sleep.   I need to find a spoken word spot near me. I haven't been on stage in ever ... maybe that's what I need. And even if they boo (which has never happened to date *knock on wood*) I'll be back in the game. Usually spoken word crowds are too mellow to boo. That would take much to much energy for us. We'd rather smoke a cigarette (or something harsher) and talk about you over drinks after you have left the building from a very bad vibe. So thank you, simply rain, for the muse and the realization ... that I am awesome. :-)   ~*RBG*~

      So I went home for lunch yesterday, like I have been known to do from time to time and I was about to put my key in the door when I heard a flapping sound. Apparently, a BIRD had flown into our hallway and was frantically trying to escape by flying from one side of the hallway to the next slamming into the windows. Now, either this bird wasn't too bright to begin with (I live on the third floor) because it flew up to the third floor but didn't realize how to get back where it came from OR the numerous times it flew into the windows ... three each side, for a total of six, on my watch ... made it stupid!   So, totally uninvolved with this birds plight, I went to eat lunch. After all, I only have an hour.   I left after checking my peephole. I didn't want to star in my own horror picture "The Birds AGAIN" where I get attacked by a small city bird upon opening my door to return to work. It just wouldn't be sexy. No bird was present. I open the door, go to lock it and there's birdie still being an idiot on the third floor. So, upon my exit I see that someone has propped open our front door leading outside, birds are chirping, there are outside sounds and EVERYTHING, and dummy is still on the third floor running into windows. I proceeded to open the back door entrance as well, so that it may have options to exit. I stand there for about five minutes ... no bird. I give up because the lunch hour is winding down.   After work I hung out with my buddy and went walking. Came home at nine and lo and behold WHAT is still in the hallway on the THIRD floor?! ... that damn bird.  lol  It was gone, or so I think, this morning.  ~*RBG*~

      Slow day around here at work and since I refuse to do work and I haven't blogged in a couple days...  My weekend was pretty cool, though it didn't turn out like I planned at all. I got stood up several times by my sisters who were to join me to said events going on, but I stopped by a few of them solo ... because I rock. In addition to seeing so many members of my organization, I also saw an old friend whom I spent a nice amount of time with between Friday up until the minute I left Sunday afternoon. It felt good to be excruciatingly happy, even if it was only for 2.5 days and perhaps a figment of my imagination.  I also went to see "Collateral" which was hot flames (good). Tom Cruise was a very convincing bad guy and was sexy as all hell. My idol, Jada Pinkett-Smith was also in the movie and I didn't know she would be. It was a pleasant surprise. Anyway, I was kinda curious how the movie would pan out because spending two hours following them around in a cab to kill six people would have undoubtedly been a bore. I was happy to see it made out better than "Phone Booth" which bored me to tears most parts.   Saturday, I lay around pretty much all morning and watched yet, more movies. We grabbed breakfast from one of my fave breakfast spots in Chicago. I then ventured out to the 'burbs for a friend's BBQ -- I could say so much about this but I will save that for another blog at another time. I will say that I watched "Dream Catcher" for the first and last time and I now know why I never bothered to see it in the first place. Two thumbs down.   I went home, went to a party, had a few beers. Left. It was a perfect Saturday.   Do you like the Spinners?  Once there was a boy and girl. Boy said, 'I love you so.' Girl said, 'I'll never leave you.' They grew older and left each other, 'Cause that's the way love goes. That's the way love goes." Then there's a time Seems like you'll never find Someone willing to love you Keep on lookin', you'll soon discover A mighty love Will sometimes make you weep and moan A mighty love You'll sit all day by the telephone 'Cause you're all alone You need a mighty love  -- "Mighty Love", The Spinners  Sometimes you need a little random 'ol school in ya life.   ~*RBG*~

      OK, so tomorrow I head to my hometown of Chicago (Illinois, that is) for Blue and White Weekend. I'm hella excited because it's my first ever! For those who may not know what the hell I'm talking about... I am a member of the Illustrious Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, IIIIIINNNNCORPORATED. And every year throughout the country, my Sorority and our brother Fraternity, Phi Beta Sigma, hosts many Blue and White weekends/weeks in their area of the United States. For instance, there's one in Chicago this weekend and one in Pittsburgh and the DC area next weekend (though I unfortunately won't be in attendance for either of those). *whisper* My neophyte is next weekend!   Will YOU be at B&W weekend? Are you in a fraternity or sorority? Which one? Have positive/negative feelings about fraternities and sororities? Share a story.  Want to join a fraternity or sorority but got questions?  Post away if you like, otherwise I will tell you about my endeavors when I return. YAY! Road Trip!  ~*RBG*~
