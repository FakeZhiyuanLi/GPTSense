      Sometimes I get tired of hiding the face of feelings behind the persona of words . That's why I'm writing this down . Hey ! Do you hear me ? I simlpy love you !

      It's so old , so far at the first glance , that seems you can only reach it by digging down an abyss as deep as 2200 days . But when you suddenly face it again ... all you can do is to mutely freeze , gaze ; wondering how all these changed in a moment . Tonight I found an old friend . Tonight I found an old feeling . Tonight I found all these again after 2200 days ...

      ... The last evening that, like other evenings, I went on a walk, it was dark and it  felt like rain, A thick mist covered everything. In the rainy weather which  decreases the sharpness of colors, and diminishes the rudeness of the lines of  objects, I felt free and relaxed, as though the raindrops were washing my black  thoughts away. During this night, that which should not have happened came to  pass. During these lonesome hours, during those minutes the duration of which I  cannot recall exactly, I walked about involuntarily. In spite of the fog, her  vague and shocking face--like the picture on pencase covers emerging from behind  the clouds and smoke--her motionless, expressionless face continued to  materialize before my eyes much more powerfully than ever before...  From "The Blind Owl" Sadeq Hedayat Translated by Iraj Bashiri

      Sitting lonely in a corner of that big dark room With my eyes closed Too numb to make a move I open my eyes Yes , they are open , but they see nothing Maybe it's dark Or it's night Or ...  Let there be more light Let there be more light

       ... "When love beckons to you , follow him , though his ways are hard and steep . And when his wings enfold you yield to him , though the sword hidden among his pinious may wound you . And  when he speaks to you , believe in him , though his voice may shatter your dreams as the north wind lays waste the garden ... For even as love love crowns you so shall he crucify you . "    The Prophet - Jibran Khalil Gibran

      Call my name . Your voice is nice . Your voice is the greenness of that strange plant Which grows at the end of sadness sincerity .  On dimensions of this silent era I am more lonely than the taste of a composition in perception abdomen of a road . Let me describe the greatness of my loneliness to you . And my solitude never predicted the raid of your volume ! And this is the virtue of love .  I am lonely , Let's steal the life , then Share it between two stares . Let's find something out from the state of stone . Let's observe things sooner . Look ! Hands of fountain make time round on surface plate of the pond . Let you be water , like a word in my silence text . Let you melt the bright mass of love on my palm .  Warm me up ( And once too in Kashan desert it became cloudy And a heavy rain started to fall And i felt cold , then behind a rock , The poppy oven made me warm . )  On these dark roads I am afraid of the product of doubt and matches . I am afraid of the cement surface of century . When you are with me , I have no fear of cities which their black soil is the pasture of derricks . Open me up like a door to the descent of a pear in this ascension of steel era . Sleepen me under a tree , far away from the metal friction night . If the dawn mine discoverer comes , wake me up . And I shall wake up while a jasmine is rising from your fingers .  And then , Tell me of the dropped bombs , while I was asleep . Tell me about the tear stained eyes And tell how many birds flown across the ocean . Tell me to which peace sentiment , the canary tied her yellow string of voice while the war machine crossed over the child's dream . Tell me which innocent goods were received at the port . Tell me which science discovered the useful music of the gunpowder . Tell me which perception was exudated from the unknown taste of bread to the taste of prophetic mission .  And then , I , like a faith warmed by the equator warmth , Shall sow you on the start of a garden .    Sohrab Sepehri - The green volume -  Taha  1377/1/6

      Sometimes it just looks familiar . You ask yourself " Have I seen it before ? " ; and you can't find the answer , it is hazy and it keeps changin place in the blurring of your mind .

      The whole written so called&nbsp;words of God spoken to human being , is just some words composed by men which has changed inevitably during hundreds of years , like any historical document . What's a religion ? If it's this they talk about , I've lost it long long ago . How many people should be killed ? remeber the crusade ? My land , the land of Zoroaster and great&nbsp;kings , the Persian&nbsp;empire&nbsp;was occupied by Arabs invading it by the name of Allah , killing thousands of men , raping women , torturing children . I've lost my creed long long ago ...

      how many hours do you spend in front of your TV set ? Is it hard for you to quit watching TV ? We are the target for a frightening endless&nbsp;flood&nbsp;of news , music , advertisements , and fashion broadcasting 24 hours a day by thousands of TV stations throughout the world&nbsp;, determinning our entire&nbsp;lifestyle subconsciously .&nbsp; Are we - as Roger Waters believes - " Amused to death " ?   Doctor&nbsp;, what is wrong with me? This supermarket life is getting long What is the heart life of a colour TV? What is the shelf life of a teenage queen?  News hound sniffs the air When Jessica Hahn goes down He latches on to that symbol of detachment Attracted by the peeling away of feeling The celebrity of the abused shell, the belle  And the children on Melrose Strut their stuff Is absolute zero cold enough? And out in the valley, warm and clean The little ones sit by their TV screens No thoughts to think No tears to cry All sucked dry Down to the very last breath  Bartender what is wrong with me? Why am I so out of breath? The captain said excuse me ma'am This species has amused itself to death Amused itself to death It has amused itself to death Amused itself to death  We watched the tragedy unfold We did as we were told We bought and sold It was the greatest show on earth But then it was over We ohhed and aahed We drove our racing cars We ate our last few jars of caviar And somewhere out there in the stars A keen-eyed look-out Spied a flickering light Our last hurrah Our last hurrah  And when they found our shadows Grouped 'round the TV sets They ran down every lead They repeated every test They checked out all the data on their lists And then, the alien anthropologists Admitted they were still perplexed But on eliminating every other reason For our sad demise They logged the only explanation left: This species has amused itself to death   Roger Waters - Amused to Death - 1992   urlLink  &nbsp;

      It's always hard to change , to accept&nbsp;the change&nbsp;, and to get used to it ... But it's innevitable sometimes , although even if&nbsp;I get my desktop theme changed , I feel kind of uncomfortable for&nbsp; at least 2-3 days when I look at the new wallpaper !

      I know , it's the hardest time for you , but sometimes all you&nbsp;should do is&nbsp;to&nbsp;let it go ... it's hard to leave all&nbsp; past behind . It's hard to forget all the moments lived together . It's hard to get the God damned old feeling out of your mind ... but have you ever thought that in every ending&nbsp; , there is a a new start ? believe me , there is .&nbsp; After all , it's only a life time , aint' it ? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * * *  &nbsp; I have always been here I have always looked out from behind the eyes It feels like more than a lifetime Feels like more than a lifetime &nbsp; Sometimes I get tired of the waiting Sometimes I get tired of being in here &nbsp;Is this the way it has always been? Could it ever have been different? Do you ever get tired of the waiting? Do you ever get tired of being in there? Don't worry, nobody lives forever Nobody lives forever  &nbsp; I will always be in here I will always look out from behind these eyes It's only a lifetime It's only a lifetime It's only a lifetime &nbsp; ( David Gilmour - A new machine parts 1-2 , A momentary lapes of reason&nbsp;, 1987 ) &nbsp;

I want to share my joy with the others . I want to laugh , I want to cry . I want to know . I want to go . I want to ...

      God says to me with kind of a smile, "Hey how would you like to be God a while And steer the world?" "Okey," says I,"I'll give it a try. Where do I set? How much do I get? What time is lunch? When can I quit?" "Gimme back that wheel," says God, "I don't think you're quite ready yet."  Shel Silverstein

      ... Let us go then, you and I, When the evening is spread out against the sky Like a patient etherized upon a table; Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets, The muttering retreats Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells: Streets that follow like a tedious argument Of insidious intent To lead you to an overwhelming question.... Oh, do not ask, "What is it?" Let us go and make our visit ...   "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock" T. S. Eliot

      Today was the last day of the smemster 12 , it's almost done ... Am I supposed to be happy ? I feel like i've put down the heavy load which i've been carryin for 6 years , yeah , I feel free ; I'm satisfied with all that I've done , but the old regret is back . I had bad days , I had wonderful days . I had days full of joy , and I had sad days . I made many good friends , friends wich you know they're always there for you , and would never let you down ... I will miss everyone , I will miss every moment ... I will miss the God damned DENTISTRY FACULTY OF TEHRAN AZAD UNIVERSITY .
