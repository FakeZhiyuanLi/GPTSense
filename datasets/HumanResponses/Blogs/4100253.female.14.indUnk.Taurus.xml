      This my first blog! these things r so0o0o0o koolie! well heres wat happened Friday through Sunday afternoon!  Friday afternoon i went to get my contacts w. my cousin and then we went to my moms play that nite and while we were there we got very very bored so we went and found this coffee shop/floral place. wen we were there we got a latte, a piece of chocolate cake and a coke. wen we sat down at the table near this fire place we saw a Feng Shui book and MAN was it HILARIOUS! we laughed about it for almost 2 hrs.! after all of that we went bakk to my moms play and got bored again so we went bakk and did the same thing at the coffee shop again b.c. we thought it rocked! so round 11:30 we went bakk to my moms play and met her 'guy friend' and then we went to Sonic round twelveish. Then we went home and went to bed! On Saturday morin' we got up round 9 (b.c. we had to..lol) and went to the mall! i bought a ring,a bracelet, sunglasses, and a kool barbie T - shirt. Then round twelve we went bakk home, got online, watched culess, got bakk online and then ate a sanwich and then took Marlena home! After we took her home, me and my mom went to Fashion Bug (didnt find ne thing i liked) and then to Goodies where i bought a pair of jeans and some shoes. Then we went home and i got bakk online and then i painted my nails, took a shower and then got bakk online. On Sunday morning i went to church and then i went ot lunch at Moes w. my moms b.f. and then we went to Montaisha. When we were done playing put - put, we went for ice cream and then came bakk home! now we're all bakk here watchin the Braves game and im writting in this! well i think i mite be spending the nite w. Ashliegh (my bffeAae) and go to church w. her and if i dont then ill check in l8er and if i do, ill check in tommorow!  i Luv u awl!  04CK05
