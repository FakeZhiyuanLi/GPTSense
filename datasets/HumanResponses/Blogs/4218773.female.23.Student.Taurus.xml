      During the middle of the night last night, a very strange sensation woke me.  I felt everything around me moving.  It didn´t last very long and I immediately fell back asleep.  This morning I woke up and found that nothing in my room was out of place, so I assumed that I had been dreaming.  When I got out of bed, I talked to Aiko, my roommate, who asked me if I had felt the earthquake last night.  Apparently, "temblos" are quite common here.  Aiko told me that last month, while she was here alone, there was one that registered 5.5.   Today I walked around a lot to try to get to know the city.  It really is a great place to be.   The historic district, where I live, is always bustling with people.  Today it was exceptionally busy because it was the first day of school for all the Mexican children and there were lots of kids running around in their clean uniforms.  The zocolo is the main square in town, it reminds me of any plaza mayor in Spain.  It is the main meeting place of everyone here, and there are always tons of people there.  It is completely surrounded by little restaurants and cafes.  There are a number of men who have set up little spots to shine shoes, lots of tables where women sell hand made crafts, and of course there are few stands where people sell very cheesey plastic touristy things.  Everyday, as I get to know the city better, I feel better about being here.  I am really enjoying everything Oaxaca has to offer.  ¡Hasta Pronto!

      Well, I have arrived! First of all, let me first apologize for all the typographical errors, because these computers do not have a way to put in apostrophies. Now, I´m here and I am really enjoying myself so far. Oaxaca itself is actually quite pretty. A lot of the buildings are painted very bright colors, and there are bars over all the windows that look much more like decoration than protection. My apartment is right in the heart of the historical part (and therefore the most touristy part) of Oaxaca, but it also feels quite safe. There is a locked gate in order to get into the building, and then we are on the fourth floor. It is one of the tallest buildings I have seen so far, apart from churches, and the view from my bedroom window is amazing. We are completely surrounded mountains, and you can just see the tops of cathedrals jutting out above the trees, and everywhere is very lush and green. The weather is really quite bearable too. We dont even sleep with our windows open at night. There are really two reasons for this. First, there are supposedly a ton of mosquitoes here. I have yet to see one, but my roommate has lots of bites. Second, it cools down quite a bit, and by morning, I am usually a bit cold.  So far I have had two days of classes at a local language school to try to get back into speaking Spanish. So far I have not spoken any English, and Im already thinking in Spanish again. However, I have forgotten a lot of my vocabulary and still need a bit of a review.  I have been given my assignment for the year. I will be working with an organization called ¨Campo¨ which, roughly translated, means the country. This organization works with nearby villages to create and implement development plans. Its not exactly human rights, but I think it will be very interesting and fulfilling nonetheless. I think thats about it for now. Hast luego...

       Well, I'm now less than 3 days away from beginning my year-long adventure to Oaxaca, Mexico. Following the examples of friends, upon the request of my parents, and in the interest of avoiding mass-emailings, I have decided to create a "blog" (a web log). This way I can keep you up to date on what I'm experiencing.       As I write this, I'm preparing to leave for southern Mexico on Sunday, August 15th. Once there I will immediately begin a three week long orientation period. This will include Spanish refresher courses, history and culture lectures, as well as a host stay. I still don't know exactly what I'll be doing once I start my work down there. I have put in my request to work with a local human rights organization, and there are quite a few in Oaxaca City, but I still don't know which one I will be placed with. After the orientation period is over I will move into an apartment in the city where I will stay for a year with 2 other volunteers, both about my age.       I hope this blog will keep everyone informed about where I am, what I'm doing, and who I'm meeting. I'm going to miss everyone terribly, please email often...but I'm really excited to embark on this amazing journey. I'll see you all in a year!           urlLink eleanorplewis@hotmail.com        urlLink eleanorpiercelewis@yahoo.com
