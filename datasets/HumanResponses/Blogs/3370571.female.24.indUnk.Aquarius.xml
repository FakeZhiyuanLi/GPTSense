      the fencing is incomplete to keep in the big sky away from the big rust eaten hole in this land just left of the north star war star the reading made him cold like crackled glass shovel your way toward me toward the screaming stereo we hang from suspenders suspended stars that illuminate they’re only balls of gas and they sometimes fall  pick them up and polish them  hang them out to drip dry on the rear part of the fence nail them up birds pecking  they are reminders of light when light once was put them in a wooden basket and they burn all at once they burn in your hand I have only one copy here of the map that tells us what we used to be    Maggie Lopez

      I held my arms out wider than a wingspan and he picked me up:      the wanting of a child  like you, child, when you crept into the bed between two days and us across the dawn your arm stretched to find my chest your fingers spread against my neck shivering, bare bellied your father bent around you in this way you are stamen sta the start of something sleeping your body stirs shifts to find the warmth it senses in the softness of my own you are an extension, tension your breathing reinvents silence  the intervals of breath calming amid your storms    fits of dreams  and for once the stars exist in light and haven’t left     Maggie Lopez

      So, this is our life?     motel rooms. Soiled bathroom floors and paint chips frayed blankets    cigarette burns the stale smell of what you were that burned into what you are now  The crimson turn of August you leave again and I wait  I trace your veins      In the glancing day behind the torn drape spotted veins a wither a sometimes     you might touch me now curl around me in the late day    take shape  You whispered once that this wasn’t true that the storm would never break but look here     a broken storm a love frothing at the mouth the aftermath of brutal waves a shore touched      then touched again rummaging through what I am  for something luminous to give you  I feel the stomping    but too faint  the braided rows of harvest      on the far off and they’re waking    inside me kicking at my ribs   muted  the flutter of something       hatching   Maggie Lopez

      Unfinished lady     her steeples pierce the sky’s mind she sits    a dark stare in her eyes on the ross, her throne of rock and watches us from the street into town fighting the wind to find her  She is a place between prayer and bone carved stone and telling stories her five ribs hold us to her nave as Mary holds her baby against the altar and the thirteen pillars    each their own spine    are still and mason hands have loved her    made her solid where she stands  but kneeling you can hear her fragile sway  the way her catacomb shelves her broken pieces only a candle lit in the south aisle of her soul     and she wept     Maggie Lopez

      some in the creases of your skin stretching when you bend around a new man  or underneath your fingernails, between your muscles  &nbsp; but some keep like breath, like sinew,  like your insides humming when you’re still  like strident etchings on your bones, like this  you can feel him spreading you &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even now  pushing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his ribs fitting within the spaces of your own  the way the body keeps  &nbsp;  Maggie Lopez
