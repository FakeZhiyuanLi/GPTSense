      Okay so I recently moved in with my best friend, she lives in a one bedroom apartment and that was okay with me.&nbsp; I figured hey we could sleep in the same room cuz she had her own bed and everything so I figured eveything would be fun.&nbsp; Her boyfriend (baby's daddy) just died in April and so I thought maybe I would give her some company.&nbsp; My boyfriend told me to be careful, that people are different when you move in with them.&nbsp; Well needless to say that she gets on my nerves all the time.&nbsp; I love her daughter, she is so beautifull, but her...oh my god, she is so wanna-be "clean" let me just tell you, she has the cat box (the box where the cat shits!!!) next to the dinning table!!&nbsp; All that smell is there right by the kitchen and the table where we eat.&nbsp; And when she wants to do something or whatever she is doing around the apartment, she just leaves her daughter there for me to take care of her.&nbsp; Then she gets mad at me cuz I dont go home so that I could watch the baby while she does what she needs to do (at home).&nbsp; I understand that she needs help and everything right now whe is on her own, and so I dont mind helping her but when I want to or when she ASKS not when she expects it from me.&nbsp; She tells me she will tell me when she is mad or upset with me and she never does but I can tell when she is.&nbsp; Oh man I have grown to hate certain things that she does.&nbsp; I understand that it was her apartment first and all, so i let her do whateve she wants, when I moved in I bought a lamp for the front room, silverwear and a set of plates, nice ones.&nbsp; Everything she has her family gave her when she moved in which is cool but man that stuff is UGLY.&nbsp; Everything I bought though I bought, I bught thinking about what she would like.&nbsp; Sot that is okay.   I have my own bed and she had an inflatable mattress.&nbsp; Well she has a cat and that cat is so annoying.&nbsp; It claws everything and it gets in the way and it stinks up both rooms.&nbsp; There is the living room which is connected to the kitchen which is connected to the dining room.&nbsp; Then there is the bedroom which is connected to the bathroom.&nbsp; So its a pretty small place that she can stink up.&nbsp; Well that cat popped the inflatable bed, and since the baby who is almost two years old doesnt sleep in her own bed yet, I decided I would be a good friend and let her an the baby sleep on my bed....big mistake.&nbsp; I had to choose from sleeping on the bed or on the futong or whatever thing that she has in the livingroom that is broken so it doesn't even become a bed anymore.&nbsp; It just sits there like a cough.&nbsp; Well I sleep there, only problem is she is seeing two guys and when they come over at night they wake me up because they knock at the door and she gets it but they come in right where I am sleeping.&nbsp; And then when they leave, they wake me up again and i work from 9-5 m-f and have been getting up really early to go get an apointment with a coulselor for school.&nbsp; So I have been really exhausted for a long time now.&nbsp; So just to&nbsp;summarize, I sleep on the couch and get woken up all the time and she sleeps on my bed all confy and everything.&nbsp; So I'm really stupid or really nice.&nbsp;&nbsp;   My parents bribed me on telling me that if I move back they will help me pay for school, which is really good because I wanted to get out of there already so I get my bed back.&nbsp; And I get to live with no drama in my life because that girl is all drama.&nbsp; She bitches abut everything and everyone.&nbsp; I am so happy I'm going back home.&nbsp; I miss my parents and I stay friends with her because I'm moving out of there not because of her but because I want to go back to school and my parents will help me but only if I move back with them.&nbsp; I have only been out of my house for about two months if not less.&nbsp; So we will see how school goes now....  &nbsp;
