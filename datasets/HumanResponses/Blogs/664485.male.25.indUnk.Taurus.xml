       urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink     I had a really good cry tonight.   I’m not really sure what exactly it was about, just a culmination of things I suppose. I miss grandma, I don’t know, there are so many things to it, I want her to be okay but I also want to be okay if she needs to leave as well. I just wish that sometimes, I could say more things, or do more things…I know she’s doing better for now but doing better is just being okay ‘under the circumstances’. It hurts because I don’t know, it just does. So many times I just want to reach out and fix everything.  Then theres him and us and tonight. I really hurt him the other night, I know what our conversation did to us, created that space, because we haven’t really talked since then. I miss our uncomplicated friendship. we still go out but now when we’re alone there’s this dreadful silence that suffocates the air, everytime we have a conversation there are so many unspoken words and so much tension and it is so hard because I really want us to be good but it’s just difficult right now. I need to be complete on my own before I get into this. I don’t want to need him or lay it all on him you know? there’s that whole thing about me not being completely his but beyond that, I want my heart and soul to be in us and only us before anything goes on. I don’t want to risk having us break down and break apart because there were things from the past or things we needed to do. I think too much for my own good but everytime he makes promises there’s a nagging feeling that asks till when? Or how long? Or what happens?  I reread my france-singapore journal. I read the things I went through and the hopes I had. The things I wanted and needed and the conclusions/solutions I had penned out. It hurt more because I’m right where I started again, discouraged. Exhausted by everything and letting things get to me.   I might have upset jared too. I seem to be good at that. I don’t even know what I want anymore. I feel half here and half there, half able to trust him and half not. I am torn because I remembered how he told me he’d be here when it ended, it hasn’t ended but he’s left already. Sometimes, confusion really gets the best of me for I am stuck in between not understanding what he wants and knowing that it is an emotional rollercoaster. I have known now that my constant violent swings from different extremes breaks us but I don’t want to learn to depend on him. I need to undo this comfort he brings. I’ve moved on but my foot is only few steps out this half opened door that at times seem so easy to just turn around and walk into. I wish things were as easy as just saying lets try again or let’s break apart. There are no more agains just the aparts but the aparts come and go. It is hard to still need someone, it is even harder to try and suppress that and be afraid of needing him. Should we attempt to challenge the hands of fate and form a bond of friendship? Or do we just leave this at the door and close this chapter and all the wounds that come with it unhealed. They both seem so easy on paper, so easily said than done. some days just good, some days just bad. How come there isn’t the in between…or rather how come there is the in between to realize how much you miss or how much you’re missing.   I am convinced that I’m complicating things more than they really seem to be. I think it comes with the uprooting. I have too many pros and cons to consider that the time I’m given allows me too overanalyse and beat myself up about it. I’m booked in to see grandma next week too, I think that that might have a lot to do with it. I don’t know what to say. I don’t want to say bye. I don’t want to leave knowing that it might be the last time I’ll see her again.   I feel untouchable and invincible. Like no one can touch and as if I’ve reached a new realm of understanding. Yet why do I still get broken late at night sometimes? Why is there still so much of debris left?  I am staring at my new chapter in the eye. I am watching this beginning unfold and am elated with the results yet there is a but in it all. The but of knowing that things might crash and fall at any time and the knowing that I have the ability to do so. It is the insecurity that bites my ass. it is the insecurity I need to conquer.   I should really get to bed now   urlLink  “If I had it all, you know I'd fuck it up”

      jeezums, it's only half past eight but i think that if i just lie down i'll be knocked out for the next ten hours. or maybe twelve. yes, it has been that kinda day. everything and anything coming at you but all good honey! :)  the kids had fun though so that's all i really care about...i'm tired as shit and need to get all this paint off me (i reckon i got painted more on me than on the shirts) and just soak my aching body for a long while but janice leaves tommorow so we're going out tonight. pah.   and i think if i have to eat one more pack of nasi lemak i'm gonna puke.   blech.  we've been on this eat malaysian be malaysian drive trying to somehow absorb in everything so that when we go back we won't miss it (fat chance) but yeah, so in the last few weeks i've eaten all bloody types of nasi lemak. scary.   and i don't even like rice!   madness.   in other news though, my cdr works again! yay!!  :)  will do this later when i get back...hugs.

         But because gramps is doing really good and i'm talkative and added that i like the feel of my keyboard clicking at this hour I shall tell you about today’s other half minus the workshop incident and parking lot.   Be warned though, it is as irritating and whiny. (yes, /you/ may fuck off now)  See, drew works at inane hours and so sometimes we all meet up at the mall(the gym’s in the mall) after the guys sweat it out and do all their shit in the morning, and so today was one of them. And see, because I terminated my membership to go back and am much too lazy to be bouncing off walls at eight in the morning, I normally just wait for them and read a book or journal at the coffee place.  So anyway, hooi ying, our normal coffee girl went someplace somewhere and got replaced by hot ass dude with the most flawless skin. Damn.    I have to add here too that jeff is retarded and desperate and has a tendency to go for exotic cocky condescending bastards. (can you tell I didn’t like “caleb”?) so anyway, the moment he steps in and sees hot ass our WHOLE conversation is dominated by the texture and size and suppleness. I kid you not.   Then there’s drew, who is a love em and leave em type and has chicks spurting out of his ass but hooi ying is Hot. Fair, thin, fragile looking, you know that type and so drew’s all depressed and upset and jeff is so fucking horny and chris is just being a total asshole. Me? I’m just plotting on ways to kill brainless drivers.   But anyway, it finally reached a point where there were three and a half different conversations going on at once and it was so stupid because we were really just talking to ourselves out loud in a group. And we’re all in our own little worlds when someone finally realizes that there’s a fucking cat underneath the bloody table.  I don’t like cats. I don’t like furry ugly things. And there’s a huge big difference between kittens and cats. Cats are ugly and mean, kittens are not.   But anyway, this is a mall. We’re in the inside section and so how in the world it got there, I don’t know. And it’s a stray I think because it looked nothing like the ones you see at pet wonderland that’s in the mall as well….but guess who found it.  Fucking jeff shrieks. Jumps up and drops his ciggie on my fucking toes. (note to self: do not wear open toed sandals in vicinity of smokers freaking out). So I scream and we look like bloody clowns because drew knocks over his coffee and so we have coffee all over, shitty dirty mean looking cat ready to draw some blood and burnt toes in an obsolete corner with see through glass. Then as if we don’t draw enough of attention, there’s construction work going on right next door.   Needless to say, hot ass had a good laugh.  He did have to bend over to mop up the mess though.   But anyway, that was my day today…now who wants to go romp around the parking lot and leave some sarcastic ranty notes, get arrested and have coffee tomorrow?  No takers?   Damn, you’re no fun.   Hmph.  :P   urlLink  “Who needs $150 an hour therapy when you have me? Thank me later. Tell your dog to thank me, too.”

      See, I’m not a guy so I obviously do not understand the obsession with upgrades and what nots and horse power bullshit so please spare me and do not attempt to explain it to me because it comes out as gibberish. Get it? Got it? Good.  Because my mechanic does not.   My reverse sensors have a mind of it’s own because they seem to beep at the weirdest times, there can be an object ten miles away and the bloody thing will start beeping. This can get awful frustrating and ass painfully irritating at traffic lights and knowing kl roads, there is no place you can go without six millions cars around you. fanfuckingtastic.   So I go in to get it fixed and this dude starts telling me about something or another and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah and he won’t fucking shut up. I’m late and it only takes about fifteen minutes to readjust the wires. I spent half a bloody hour listening to his nonsense. Gahhhhhhh.  Screw the independence. The next time I’m just going to let whoever take it in.   And still onto cars…:0  All you bastards that park in the disabled spots should be castrated, shot, wringed and put through the steamrollers. Six thousand and seventy two times.   I was very very tempted to write mean sarcastic notes to the assholes today or perhaps accidentally bang their cheap ass sardine can cars but then I was running late so perhaps I will do that tommorow. In any case though, I hope some day you’re crippled and you have to park 10, 000 spots away from the elevators just so you get a taste of your own medicine.   Meanies.   Man, I have something stuck up my ass…and that just came out totally wrong.  I think all this abstinence has made me horny, I humbly apologize….but it keeps the hits coming doesn’t it?  Boobies! Boobies! Boobies! (thank you evan)  Okay, I shall be returned to my den now.    urlLink “How the hell could someone not like boobies? Stop the planet and let me off. Christ.”

        our excuse for humans.    i /really/ wasn't going to give a flying fuck to come back here and explain things but seeing as i wrote that i would go to sleep three hours ago and am still running up and down, left right and center and with a shit ass tired and easily irritated mind, i am going to explain myself.    number one.  the last i checked, it was *my* site and *my* oppinions and *my* fucking love life. fuck off if you don't want to hear it.   number two.  i have never claimed to be a godly christian. i believe in god, we have a good arrangement and lets keep my dealings with him private okay? fornifuckcation is none of your bloody business and if i go to hell, glad to know i'll see you there.    number three.  my take on the whole exes at my wedding thing was merely me trying to make a point backing my reason that it is good to stay single, to narrow down options, to be choosy and picky and anal and not just bang any tom dick and harry. i did not in any way mean to offend whoever i mentioned, you don't even bloody know who they are and if they are upset because i just listed our affairs and our dealings out into the bad wide world of the internet than i repeat, OUR business.      number four.  i am not ready for a relationship. what's it to you?   number five.  yes, i am a drama queen, i have never denied that but no, everything i said i meant.    number six.  i have never understood people like you. i thank god i don't because i'm far too nice to make voodoo cutouts of you and stab you right where it hurts the most. it was an excellent idea though.   and lastly, because i'm "whining little fuck", this is my place. my heart and soul. i'm sorry you don't like it and i'm sorry you find it so damn difficult to muster it down and if so, then why bother? save me the trouble and the bastards at hotmail from deleting my other far more important mail okay? i am not even going to begin reasoning with you, i think we're beyond that now, neither am i going to apologize for what i write. i write what i write and at least i have a life. you need one too.   and now that that's off my chest, i'm going to bed. yes, naked.

       urlLink     forgive me if I blubber and stumble.   In between of all the bullshit that’s been going on in the last week, someone made me think of it last night. Someone special. Someone I gave a part of me to, someone I know will have that part of me for as long as I live. Someone irreplaceable.  I imagine my wedding day, I imagine The One and I pledging eternity and till death do us part but with us are the others, the exes of our past, the people we once promised forever to. And then I realize and it hits me that when I am to be married to him that my heart and perhaps, neither is his completely ours. That hurts. For everytime you get into a serious emotional relationship, you give a part of your heart away.  I have no regrets for the pieces that are etched in me of them for it still brings smiles and comfort some days but it is hard nonetheless to know that I am not pure, not complete, not truly a hundred percent only his and his alone.   Abstinence. I have never really practiced it, it makes me tainted and dirty. Not a reflection of god, not a good example, perhaps even, not wanted. But then in society and the generation that I have grown up in it has become so acceptable, so easy, so okay. I have always believed in sleeping with only people you love, trusting someone enough to reach that new level. There are benefits but what can mar it all is when sex is used as a bait rather than a way of affection.   I’ve had lovers who were in the relationship for the sex and used sex as an object. Violated that trust. Actually, I’ve only had one lover like that. He broke my heart but he’s still in my life. It is like that itch you can’t get rid of. Like eating fast food and that instant gratification and it feeling so good yet consciously, bad for you. he’s left me high and dry, he’s left me more times than I care to remember but yet each and every single time he’s begged I’ve let him in again. I’ve been hurt and hurt continuosly but yet some faulty mechanism in me caves in every time he needs me. I am a game player, I am emotionally mental and highly indecisive, I am your version of the worst girlfriend you can ever get yet he is exactly like me. perhaps that’s what attracted us to each other, your novice game player, the challenge. the sucking up what we needed from each other selfishly.  I’ve known him for much of my whole actual dating life and something tells me he will never leave.   I’ve been the bitch and I’ve been the mistress. I’ve been the one being cheated on and I’ve been the one that’s dumped. I’ve been the one that dumped and I’ve been the one that left. I’ve been all of those things…have they made me wiser? Maybe, maybe not.   I met him when I was sixteen. Seemed like a young age but back then, everything accelerated. When you were twelve you were going on fifteen, when you were sixteen you were going on eighteen and when you are eighteen, you’re going on twenty one. Perhaps that explains why I’ve never dated someone younger than I am, that or I could give you the crap about how women mature faster than men.   He was everything I’d ever imagined in a man. The One you know. Yet we had gotten out of volatile relationships and were still being constantly drawn back into them. He was cute and he was charming and sweet and funny and kind. We flirted, we talked, we shared but it wasn’t till much much later that things started becoming concrete. Sure there were lets have dinner together nights and sure there were moonlight walks, stolen kisses and conversations that never ended but something always distracted us or pulled us apart. Then when we finally did get together it was magical. Surreal. It was blissful and perfect and so amazing. I swear the flowers were livelier and the skies bluer and everything was just so divine and heavenly and everything was just nice. We reached our comfort zone but bit by bit we started growing apart. The distance didn’t help yet we tried again and again to make it work. We flew in fortnightly, we wrote long mushy emails talked daily, we left little gifts around, we made plans and tried to work on it but it reached a point where there was just nothing left. We were overexhausted and tired and so it ended. It didn’t become crazy, we just had nothing left in us. It hurt a lot but it ended beautifully…if there was the simplest most honest okay break up, it was that. I slipped out and we didn’t talk much to each other for a long while. I missed him because he was a good friend above everything else.   I’ve found him again and have begun to rediscover him, we know that we cannot work it out being together again…not at that level for we are moving on in our own separate lives. We talk about things with less red tape, with blunt, sometimes suffocating honesty because I have given that to him, I hesitate to think that this honesty might ruin the future. Too much honesty is bad sometimes.   History repeats itself.  I am in a funny place right now. I am right in between swearing off love yet wanting to try it again. I don’t know if I want to go through another relationship and give away again another part of me to someone else for safekeeping. I don’t know if I want him to join that line of befores and should things not work out, the line at my wedding day. It scares me whenever he’s said I love you, it’ll still scare me for a while more. I get funny when he says forever. Because I think about all the forevers that have fallen apart.   I know I cannot get into a relationship right now for the timing is awful yet I do not want to stand here and push away this amazing friendship that we’ve found. How do I keep it at this level of closeness and not let anything get beyond this. How do we keep this relationship strictly platonic? I am not done with my issues from the past, I still wake up to tears some nights and I need to get away from that before I can give my all in this. Will it be too late?   Hope is a strange thing yet hope also confuses a lot of things. I have hope for the future to work things out but so much evidence is laid to know that we might never ever work out but how can I ignore even that little slither of hope? I suffocate it with thoughts and with best laid out plans of all the anger and hurt but I have already let go of most of that in hopes to move on with my life. Those are my overbearing radar signals that emit out the fuck off status. Am I ready to face the world alone without protection?  I have digressed from my original point, I can’t quite remember how I reached this nor really what my specific point in this post was but rather that I don’t want to date just for the sake of dating you know? I don’t want to go out, meet some guy, go out for a few months then end it again, I don’t want to do the game playing, the ping ponging of different extremes and emotions, I don’t want to try try again when it is pointless. I don’t want to shop and not buy.   I want to love and be loved. And I want it forever.   I want there to be no compromise or broken promise for that.   But I know you cannot provide that, and that’s why it’s not alright.  That’s why I need to be alone.     "Pain is inevitable but misery is optional.”

       urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink     you know what i hate? i hate it when i come back stinking of stale ciggarettes and booze. so frustrating because it gets under your skin and the whole way back in my semi intoxicated mind it's just chanting, i need a bathe, i need a bathe. i swear i need to soak in peroxide or something.  there were so many fucking people tonight. i don't like people. well not right now anyway, and i don't like talking to random strangers and i don't like being nice to people i don't know and holding conversations that are so stupid and repeated and dumb. i also don't like dancing in public and swinging my fat ass and being sociable. yet despite all that, i had fun tonight. it was a good distraction, thank you you. and you. for making tonight the first night in a while that i've really laughed and smiled.   i got coerced(conned) into watching sophie ellis baxter perform. actually, i just got forced, period. because this bastard decided to ring and then because i'm being cranky and frustrated and lazy i don't pick up my phone and he doesn't leave a message and so the next thing i know i'm talking with a couple of friends online and he's standing at the door telling me to get dressed. the best thing being, he roped in my brother as well so i couldn't exactly back out of it. it was fun and loud and noisy and she had one very yummilicious dancer which everyone is convinced is gay because really, aren't they all? and to that i say, good for them then.   i also got picked up by a chick tonight. that tickles me, because i had fun with sexy white tube top girl. i questioned her advancement though, it must have been pretty obvious that i was straight yet she very admiringly convinced me to dance with her. yes, me dancing. stage. lights. dancing. i blame the drink. she might have tried to grab my ass a couple of times too. but it's cool even if  urlLink you  might be jealous.  :P  they served some moet which was good but i hate moet so i just smiled and nodded as the much too cute waiter dude person handed us drink after drink. it's very funny when you're pretty sober and you're watching your friends get pissed drunk. it's even funnier when they start talking nonsense and telling you stories.  i must have been really quiet tonight because pompous ass bitch noticed. well, that was when she wasn't snogging every other moving thing that is.   it's been a good day but i am so tired i'm actually falling asleep typing this.   i wanted to blog this to remind myself how i feel right now. peaceful.  haven't had that in a while.  thank you all who made today so much better.

      I had to song lead for Sunday worship today, so last night I had to go to church for band practice and run through the whole thing for the third service today. Songs I had chosen to be sung last week seemed so inapplicable, I wish I wrote right now that somehow god reached out his hand and touched me and everything was alright again but it wasn’t because last night when I came home I was more miserable and depressed then ever.   I wanted to sing off key and tell them to bang on the drums harder and break the guitar and run around screaming but I ran through the motions, ignoring all that was within and concentrated on putting on a good show. People stopped to talk, to ask how things were, to hug, to pray, to give in words of comfort but they were just merely what they were, just words.  Then because I have to (start) keeping my promises, I’d promised the kids last week that we’d paint t-shirts for the kids at Cares. I have to do t-shirt painting with the cancer kids next week at the playroom and so the other kids that are on the bed don’t get anything and so the kids at the shelter want to paint them shirts as well. If that’s too complicating, I basically had to face up to the kids yesterday, something I really did not feel like doing at all.   …I felt like crawling beneath the sheets and blocking out everything and anything and going to sleep or crying my fat ass to death. But I didn’t…couldn’t. had a life to live, had promises to keep, had more things to do and people on my back.   I spent too long at the shelter than felt even sorrier for the world and then because everyone’s so fucking worried no one let me go home till I had about all I could really take from anyone. I think there was about 15 seconds in between when i would have really lost it and just burst into tears.   I finally came home at three in the morning and chris wanted to stay over and keep me sane for the night but I couldn’t take anything from anyone anymore. I love him to death but it was just so suffocating because everyone hounds you and questions you and I’m okay and everything was just difficult. I hate it when people see me at a weak moment, and I hate being so exposed and so…I don’t know. just too much attention. I don’t want to need someone you know? I just don’t want to do that whole thing again. It hurts too much.   Ironically, I did need him last night. I needed him to take it all away and let him just catch me but I know he’s not mine anymore so it’s okay. I’m still okay. I’m still alright. I’m just angry at the world right now. angry at myself. angry because this should be a new day.

      My grandma went into respiratory arrest this morning. I don’t know how I feel exactly at this moment, I think I am numb, I understand what has happened but I haven’t accepted it. I feel disconnected, strange, like is she really my gramps? Is that grandma?   She’s in the icu right now. my parents flew in straight away, I’m not allowed to go. I want to scream but I can’t, I’m not sure if I want to see her the way she is now. does that make me selfish? I’m sorry, I don’t know, I don’t know how to make sense of this.   I’m trying not to cry, I’m trying to be strong. I have to be strong but I’m so afraid. I don’t want her to die. I just…I don’t know. I love her. It’s so hard. I have pictured this a million times but now as it happens every part of me is so lost.    I hope she’s okay…please be okay.

        faceless.    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink     appearance and reality...i find it all too easy and available to simply mask and be... the person i am is multi layered, exposing the different textures in me that can exist. does that make me shizo? does that make me assholic? does that make me indecisive? perhaps so, but it also makes me comfortable.   yet there are times like today, when i look and see and laugh cynically yet ironically at the person i am on the outside and inside. i laugh because it is funny that things can be misinterpreted so and judgement crosses the path i walk on already molded and formed. i cracked up rereading  urlLink my testimonial  today, i wonder if perhaps she had seen me inside if everything i have ever achieved mattered. things look too perfect on the outside, too put together. she writes only a couple each year, specifically for the over achievers. how in the hell am i one of them?  then i laugh at me. i laugh because i am a walking talking breathing joke. such a fucking farce...yet i am not angry anymore. i was bitter, angry, and assholic before about having too many facades and having too many faces, i can only accept them now as how i am. this is my version of honesty.  a friend told me once that as long as i was comfortable in my skin, i could be whoever and whatever i wanted to be. selfishness sometimes too is an important part of survival. i take the brickbats, just like i take the backstabs, i take the compliments just like i take the criticism, i take days and hours and weeks away from reality, just like i take those times manifesting in it. i take what i can get for it is me.  i am not sorry that i was upset yesterday, for it made me a better person today. so often we focus on what's easily available, easily conquered, choosing simple over better.   i challenge you to choose difficult. i challenge to change something in you that you've needed to change a while. i challenge you to climb that mountain, cross that sea, swim that ocean. i challenge you to be yourself. just you.   fuck whoever and whatever else. if nobody loves you for just you than there is no point at all.  no, this is not a i'm mad at him because he wants me to be someone i'm not retaliation but rather a i'm me and i can only be me and i will be me no matter how many faces i put up and how many different walks i'll go though for in the end it is just me and so you can only love me for me and not love me but want me to be someone else type of thing.   if that made sense.   :P  nice long understanding working out talks are good.   in other news though, i only had one extra jab today so it was nice..and the kids are doing really really well and we're making shirts next week! :)  you doing good?   urlLink  "But she felt she truly saw some of his depth that night. She understood so much more. Things she once thought were frivolous suddenly made sense to her. And that was the moment she knew what he could do for her. He could love her, comfort her, keep her safe & warm.... but more than anything he could show her how to feel alive again. "

        empty.    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink      "no one said it was going to be easy, no one said you won't wake up on days where you will feel like screaming your head off because it's so frustrating and no one said there won't be days where everything will hurt so bad and so you'll just cry and cry and cry somemore. no one said it was going to be easy. but there is hope. and hope is beautiful."   i took a walk alone tonight. just me. it was dark outside, darker than usual, gloomy, i was gloomy. i was down, for some reason. just not in my best spirits. the street lights were out, the moon looked terrible. i walked fast fast faster sometimes, and then others slow slow slowing stopping stride. only it wasn't really a stride. it was a just one more step, just a couple of streets more, just a while longer..you're okay ones.  i took pictures. nothing came out right..it frustrated me, so i walked somemore.   i looked and peeped into other people's lives. i watched the kids play. i smelled the staleness in the air. i passed by the candles lit up for the funeral on the next street. i looked up to the heavens, the clouds, my most favorite thing in the world but there was nothing. only plain cloudless skies. only a half heartedly shining moon. only an empty street.   i looked inside. i searched for the person i was inside but i was empty, i was tired. i was drained from all of today's going ons. i was hurting and holding back the tears that threatened to flow. i was holding on and keeping strong, humming my desolate tune. breaking me it wailed...breaking me.   upload the pictures. write another post. go on away.  i have emails to write. phone calls to make. a bathe to take. things to do.  but for this very moment, i am just curled up in my little corner letting the tears free.  i cannot be strong tonight.  i am only me.   just stupid retarded me..and i am hurting.   just having a bad day.    urlLink "If I am not free to fail, I'm not free to take risks, and everything in life that's worth doing involves a willingness to take a risk and involves the risk of failure...I have to try, but I do not have to succeed."

        someone said drama?    urlLink     Because I know you like crazy ass maid stories and laughing at me is always good for you :P   So crazy maid two decided to poison my mom today. With her spit.  Absolutely disgustingly abhorringly revolting. * blech *  See, crazy maid two is a bit senile and retarded and so today, when my mom told her that she did not need to go grocery shopping with nice maid one, she flipped…vehemently insisting that it was of national crisis that she went. My mom of course told her that it was not and that she should just continue doing whatever maidly things she was doing and obey as she was told because that’s what a good maid does right? She listens to her commands. (I feel like god now btw :P)  Then because she’s in charge of making breakfast she  brings  slams my mom her coffee and whatever else and my mom, thankfully, notices a gob of congealed phlegm floating ever so serenely on her nice black coffee. My mom looks at it kinda in disbelief and then tells her to pack her bags.  Lol, it would have been funny had it not been spit and had it not been my maid but considering it is my maid, and it was spit, I can only find this funny ten hours later.   Crazy maid starts yelling and screaming and spitting all over the damn place and all this drama begins of course when I naively, sleepily and regretfully come down to the dining room for what I thought would be just another boring stupid day. Picture me, in my nice bright red pants and all my glory, stepping into the room, nonchalantly going to my seat and then this whole explosion of fury and words and body fluids. Oh yes, it was a great morning indeed.   Nice maid then comes over and kind of protects me because at this point crazy maid is really starting to flip and she’s is screaming. And I mean really screaming. Like seven hundred and sixty five decibels screaming about anything and everything in a flurry of English, Malay and Indonesian and just really flipping. And I’m still trying to figure out, what the fuck?  The guards of course then come running down because of all this inhuman screaming that is coming from the house and then uncle ahmad kinda like restrains her with the rest of them. I swear I felt like I was in a fucking movie. Then suddenly, crazy maid changes tactics and starts crying. Bawling. Sobbing. Begging. She goes mmmaaaaammmmmmmmm, then she goes kaakkk rraacchhhheeaaaallll, then she goes ssssiiiiiiirrrrr and I’m all like, Get. Away. From. Me.   Scariness.  Then of course we find out later that she had to see some guy at the market and that she’d been seeing him for a while now and that they’ve been going out together. I look at my bed and I pray to god nothing happened there. Then we also find out that she’s been giving away our things to the other maids and the other dude as well to sell or use and that she’s also been having parties for the rest of the neighborhood maids on Sundays when we’re at church and sneaking whoever and whatever lunch and dinner…I wonder if theirs were laced with spit as well.   But the worst thing is not knowing if all this while I have been eating my maid’s spit. Nice maid does all the cooking and evil crazy maid is in charge of helping her to prepare though. I’m almost glad I throw up what I eat because this suddenly makes me even more sick. Then if I really wanted to mess things up further I could conclude that it was all a conspiracy by the nice maid because we have previously screwed her in her past life and so crazy maid has been framed. Of course then I’d also believe that I saw purple spotted cows today….but then again.   So that’s another crazy stupid evil maid story for you to be stored into the archives of the out to get racheal list.    Madness.    urlLink  "I'd slap you but shit splatters."

        ready for the world (again).    urlLink    i really should be banned from blogging at this hour.  i think too much for my own good too.  my new found tom friend is cool. he  urlLink writes  pretty damn good.  i made a huge mistake the other night. guilt is definitely not my good friend.   five player scrabble games are cool.  my test results come out on wednesday. i hope i don't need another jab or course of something. it is such a pain to be sick.  i am such a whiny little brat.  it is hard to end a game when you are stuck with all vowels.  i have to bribe the literati gods.  pop tarts at two in the morning make me laugh.  i'm sleepy.  i have a long rant in my head but it won't come out.   i really talk too much for my own good.  my dad's throwing me a party.  i don't really want a party.  sheesh.  and on a more serious note..  i've noticed lately that a lot of bloggers seem to be coming clean. i did that today. i gave an old friend the blog address because she asked if i still had that thing online. i really wasn't sure how she would take it, i am anticipating that she might take it really badly, not because of what i've said here but rather the connection of racheal in the real world and racheal online.   i've struggled lately, to really sorta come to bring them together. that comfortable place where i do not need to pretend nor am i insecure with how much i am revealing.    and it. is. Hard.   i wonder if i want to give out this address to people in my real world. my mom used to read my old blog, i think it was too painful for her but today, she asked me again if it was okay if she came and read this one. i haven't answered her, i don't really think i can prevent her from coming in. it is more of like a trust thing, she knows i will know if she came in here and all i have hanging on it is her word to not come in here and read what i have to say unless i'm okay with it.  i guess i'm really sorta overprotective then. because this really is my baby. i designed it, i made it, i pored over it but most of all, everything inside here is a mirror image of me. i know every nook and corner and what it represents. i have found writing to be my best tool of honesty for faces can decieve and lie.   i am slightly shaken and unsure about this but yet the trepiditation(sp?) of being free to be who i am and what i am excites me. i vowed in my old blog to only write for me but then as the numbers increased and as i began to realize that my written word affected people i started censoring myself. i really hope that does not happen again.  i do not want to use my blog to hurt people. i have done it countless other times before. because writing is mostly my safe place and writing it out is how i make sense of the situation, me using the words that formed sentences onto the screen through my mind at that very moment has made a mark and causes a reaction or a significant effect.   i want this to be a medium of self discovery yet i also wish for it to be a platform for the things i believe in. i like meeting new people and the brilliant new and old friendships that have formed and bonded through this medium has never ceased to amaze me. i am thankful and grateful yet there are times where i wish i could turn back the hands of time and begin again.  i can't but can only turn over this chapter and rewrite my story.  will you rewrite it with me please?  jared and i talked. it hurt but things are starting to look up again, it's ended yet this is a good ending. i think i'm beginning to like life again...now isn't that scary?   urlLink  "but there's nothing wrong with that. its your site.  you can write long stuff if you want.  you can write short stuff if you want.  you can write 'cheese' in six inch high letters if you want."

        you're   "special"   special.   lately, i've realized that whenever i have a proper meal i feel nauseated after that. i'm trying to figure out if it's just a side effect or if there is really something wrong with me. and so i searched it under  urlLink google  and well apparently, it's common. i find that absurd yet it makes sense too though it does make me very cranky and frustrated. because it just means that i can't eat whatever and whenever you know? like i have to really ration things. which irritates me and throws my whole thing off balance. but i'd still rather opt for that any day than looping, which unfortunately, i did today. but then i'm also trying to defend it by saying that i was already nauseated and so it didn't really count because i was sick already. except then how is that different from bullimia when the point was to keep it in?   i read  urlLink this  tonight. it felt really weird.   i don't even know if i should be posting this. it's scary to think that whoever reads this might know that i have a problem. and it's scary to think that judgement will be passed. and it's scary to think that someone will analyse me and attempt to figure out or underline my faults and flaws. and it's scary to think that i am willingly exposing myself to this.   i can't remember how this started. it began a long time ago i think. around the time junoir high school started, when everything great was going even better and then suddenly, like all things, insecurity crept in. i worried too much and thougth about too many things. i've always tried and defended it by saying that i'm just made like that, to be oversensitive you know? but it's bloody destructive, that much i'll tell you.  i was aneroxic in the beginning though i didn't really know i was at that time. it just sorta fell into place you know? like i had too many activities or things i had to do in a day that i couldn't find the time to eat. i'm not sure if i did it subconsciously or if i really did not know at all. i am thinking that perhaps it was a little of both. it felt great when i started losing weight, because then people commented, and i got more jobs, i was the right look, the right type, in other words, i was another ignorant stupid dumbfuck sucked into an illness, but it was working. then i noticed. and it scared the living shit out of me.  i think it went downhill from there.  when i was young and people talked about being aneroxic or bullimic, i always thought that i'll have the upperhand, i'd always thought it was the stupidest most dumbest thing anyone could ever do. i never understood why or how and what the hell ran through these silly people's minds but then i became one of them. and i saw. and understood.   and i saw how at times, no one really cares about who you are inside but rather what you are on the outside. i saw that if i was small and thin that directors hired me because i appealed to what was society's take on beautiful. i saw that it was normal to go into an office full of walking talking skeletons, people that encouraged you to throw up because apparently it was good for you. it was a fucked up world...but it was my world.   they sent me to theraphy when it ended up with having a can of diet coke a day. that was my grand meal of the day. but then i could only hide so much..and so i found out that when i came home for dinner, i had to pretend to eat. then throw up after that. so that's my introduction to bullimia. because i didn't and wouldn't and couldn't face up to it and especially not with my parents. i didn't know if it scared me more to know that they'd be angry or if it scared me more to know how much they'd hurt if they knew.   i became so good at lying to the world. it was my craft after all..masking faces. the people that knew were convinced i was healed. inside, it was just an even bigger spiral to hell. friends would ask and cajole and my best way of pretending was doing the exact opposite of what i'd been doing before. i'd take the time out and sell my new image to them and completely squashed their doubts and made lunch dates with them and had a balanced meal with dessert and shit and then throw up after that. i threw up and threw up untill i was physically exhausted. i threw up whenever i had a meal. big or small. i didn't binge much, just threw up.   a while ago, i realized how i really didn't want to do this anymore. and so i've been 'good' the last couple of months. maybe even a whole year. been clean except when i go for long dinners, or parties, or gatherings. somehow, so much of food still scares me.   i've never admitted this to anyone but i'm afraid. i'm afraid if someday i kill myself doing this and i know enough that it is a possibilty. and i'm afraid of hurting my parents but at times it is really out of my control. like it eats you from inside. the oh my god you fat little bitch.   but then i have good and bad days. so it's just ups and downs i tell myself. just looping.   i have to accept who i am but some days that is difficult.   this isn't a i'm depressed entry, nor is it another one of those shitty things racheal likes to talk about. i'm still doing good you know? i'm still on this whole road to holy atonement. still in the 'right frame of mind'.i don't know why i wrote this. i think i was feeling guilty. i think i just needed an outlet.   i think i just needed to tell myself that i just had a bad one time only. that it was okay.   i hope i'm okay.  because it'd be really stupid to die from bullimia and get through cancer.   excuse me if this disgusts you, i will return hyper racheal tommorow.  hugs   urlLink  "Today I am still not cured from bullimia. I do not expect that I ever will be. It is an ongoing daily process of increasing self worth and decreasing fear of food, my body and the relationship they share."

        love you.    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink       dear che che,  just wanted to tell you that i'll miss you so much. thank you for being the che che i never had, for all the good, bad and fantastic times. love you.  kisses, mei mei.   she taught me how write my name in chinese. how to speak in a horrible irish accent. helped me design my prom dress. braided my hair and tucked me in at night. she's loved me all these years and been there for me in the typical asian subtility(is there such a word?)   she flies back to belfast again tonight. she's officially a mrs now. gonna have cute little semi irish babies. gonna eat chips and vinegar again.  went shopping today. says she'll fly in from london for my birthday. it's my eighteen. thinks i'm special enough and worth it. makes me want to cry.   miss her already. words are so hard between us. we have to stop crying, can only hug and cry some more..it's absurd. she tells me to be good. tells me to take care. i tell her all the things i'm supposed to tell her. and with that she is gone. we wave and stand there a while, just till after she's passed the dreaded customs. she's on a flight tonight. alone. waiting to meet her husband again. she is happy yet sad. i am..i don't know what i am. i am missing her.  have a safe flight home.

        bodoh.    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink       urlLink blogger  hates me.   or so i think.  that or it has a very sick sense of humor.  ...or maybe i played too much with my template and it got tired of editing and publishing and editing and publishing and editing and publishing and oh well, you know..  or maybe it's just angry with me and i've somehow overloaded it with so much of rubbish html codes and i've somehow stringed together in what seemed like codes but weren't really real codes and were just a result of racheal thinking it was a code when it really wasn't a code.   but then of course i only came to this conclusion after i changed computers. three times. because heaven forbid should the ever efficient and user friendly blogger have a nervous breakdown.   so i took a diskette, a great big effort in itself because who the hell in this house uses a diskette when you can just burn it into a cdr. well not me said i. and so after looking in between cracks of bookshelves and under my bed and in my drawers and all around the bloody room, i finally found one. a virused one that is. because largely emblazoned on it in tip ex was 'retarded'. my room is 22x75, and you'd think that with everything packed up and with all of that bloody space that i'll find at least one unvirused diskette right? well apparently, i was wrong. because i ended up going next door and asking for a diskette, which of course brought on the whole cdr issue. again. for the six hundred and seventy second time.    but i'll get back to my point again.  so i take my diskette, and copy my files and label them and that's all fine and dandy till i bring it to the other computer. everything loads and opens up nicely till stupid  urlLink blogger  gives me an error message. again. of course, any normal person with a brain would have figured out that hey, maybe blogger's just acting up. but nooooo, i have to be convinced that is my freaking computer and connection. so what do i do?  i use the laptop.   only that the laptop needs a password.  and i can't for the bloody life of me remember the darn thing.   i tried  shit . then i tried  hairy   . then i tried  stupid  and  slut  and  dumb  and  moronic  and  love  and lastly, even  god . i kid you not, at some point in time, those were actual passwords to accounts because every bloody thing needs a god damn password now doesn't it? and i can't bloody centralize it because see,  al ,  evan ,  jared ,  jasmine ,  kara  and  chris  have the blogger passwords so they can figure out whatever shit i've put in there that isn't working. and  bryan ,  tim ,    sakthi ,  chris  and  drew  have my email passwords because they send out emails for me or download them for me when i don't have time to or like the other day, change my passwords for me because i really should be banned from sending long annoying stupid emails which i will regret later. don't even get me started on the chain emails. and  steve  with  drew  has my work account password because god forbid, should i die or anything, he would know how to handle all the crap in there. then there's my phone password which half the world has and knows because..i don't actually know how they know but they just seem to. then there's the password for the house alarm, and the door alarm, and  urlLink various   urlLink other   urlLink chat   urlLink mediums  and so really if i were to centralize, would not nothing be just mine anymore? but then i have another rant stored for that and so i will continue on with this one...which is that with all these bloody passwords, how the hell am i supposed to remember what i put in for the password on the lap top considering i only use it when i'm taking a bath and feel like watching a movie, or late at night when my fat ass can't walk across the room to switch on the pc, or when i have to use a different line, or when i feel like it. in which i don't. because i don't know, it just doesn't work for me and i hate hate hate hate the mouse and can't stand the screen nor the keyboard but yeah, what's my fucking password?  so then admist all this i forgot to ring steve back to say that we'd go for the  urlLink mib  thing tonight. which was dumb and ignorant and insensitive of me because oh, we only planned on going to this thing since last month but well, i forgot. which is no excuse. so why didn't he ring instead? because when he did earlier i was asleep thanks to some pills i had to take for the thing last week and so he thought that i needed rest and that i didn't feel like going and let me sleep instead. doh.  and so, i still haven't watched  urlLink mib , i still can't access my template and i am still tired. minus the fact that i've slept for a good portion of today but yeah, whatever!  and so just now, when i sat down to write this, i remembered the bloody thing.   "dumbass."   i think i will shoot me now.   in other news though, i got some very cute pants fr  urlLink tommy  today. and my scanner works again. and i talked to  urlLink koren  at six in the morning because some people don't know how to plus eight hours. oh, and i had a popsicle for dinner. which was very very good. like a slushie cum popsicle cum orange tasting syrup thing. :) and i made a  urlLink few   urlLink new   urlLink friends  too. hm...that and  urlLink he's  bloody adorable. :P  now, if only i can get this damn template done.    urlLink  "No, Lisa, you cannot pull that bitch out of her car, run her over, then drive away leaving her on the street. Just beep and give her the finger”

        meshes.    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink      "dear you.. it's taken you a while to get here hasn't it? so much has changed..so many crazy turns have ensued from no where and so i hope this comforts...guides, provides hope if and when you need it.  you need to learn to be more aware and responsible for your actions. you've made mistakes along the way getting here and so you know what i mean when i say every action has a reaction. no doubt, there are things that are sometimes, not up to you at all, that are beyond your capabilities or control but there are others too, that are. and living your life well means taking control of it and having enough of strength and dignity to know that you can get through to the next day with a smile and a pieced together solid heart. it's knowing that at the end of the day, come what may you can hold your head up high and be proud of who you are or even just be grateful for that small little thing and not give up.   you have a tendency to believe the things in your mind. you've always been set in your ways..determined little tyrant, you're used to getting things done your way and i know that that very brute and obscene strength that puts you where you want to be is also, a lot of times, the reason why you're stuck in that hole. the reason why you fall. that balance is precariously positioned that it can only be achieved by one who deserves, by one who does not use her ass to think, by one who is calm and rational. by one who thinks.  your very disabilities can work out to be your attributes if you twist the right key, if you turn the right knob.   you are sensitive. i guess we've always known that. i know things hurt you easily, and i know how easy it is to just fall back into routine. to do the things you're used to. to give up halfway because it gets so damn difficult sometimes. i know it's hard and at times you are so tired of everything and feel so lost, know that at those times, the father up above keeps you safe and is watching, that he loves you even if you're weary, haggard and displeasing to the eye. that he'll carry you through footprints in the sand and pick you up when you are down. that itself is the true meaning of love and trust and faith.  every little hurdle, every trial and tribulation, every damn obstacle was put there for a reason...and it's an open path. you still have to make choices and you still have to make decisions to decide the very road you will walk on, the very path you will take.   when no one else believes in you, i will. when no one else listens, i will. and when no one else is there, you'll still be here. alive.   live it like it's meant to be lived. live it like there is no tommorow. live it with no regrets but most importantly, live it for you.   relationships fall apart sometimes. whether it was your fault or his or the both of you, it is time to move on. let go because if that is the only advice i'll give, then it is the best i will ever give. let go because nobody starts a painting on a dirty canvas. nobody builds a house on a crappy foundation. and nobody applies make up to a greasy face. this is your platform. this is your life. this is your decision. this is your turn that only you can make. it's your time, your moment to decide if you will break and fall, or make it and dance.  i know some parts of you that don't understand and perhaps even, don't want to anymore..then don't hang on to it. you've done a good job the last few days and it is something i can be proud of. because unlike other times where the dirt was just swept under the rug, i bear no grudges nor condemnation but rather bear not anything at all. endings and closure merge together to give in to new skin, new life, to rejuvenate, to rediscover, to relive. to start afresh. new. not forgetting where you've been but merely using it for the better.  live one day at a time, let love rule over hate or anger. let trust rule over being afraid. and know that whatever happens, happens.   take care of yourself and know that in your life, there are many many people behind you, willing to help if you ask. know that while you cloud yourself with the less fulfilling events, that you've been blessed abundantly. and so, it isn't really a solution for there is no one specific queastion but merely just a hodge podge of a series of events linked together spurred by actions and strenghtened by humanity.   hold on to humanity spread love if not only because love is how things will fall into places, for you to make love and not war.  if love were only a will to possess, then it is not love; for love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails. "   i wrote this last night before i went out because while waiting, i came across an email i wrote to adrian when things were falling apart for him. and then i figured, if i could tell that to him and want him to believe me when i say that things would be right, how can i turn around and not believe it myself? and so, the above letter was written. the things i knew in my mind but needed to write out. just things filtering through my mind, keeping me sane you know?   and it was strange too, because last night, when we all got together, we were all different and changed and completely just sorta dazed a while because we were almost like strangers. and so, it took a good twenty minutes before the smiles became real and genuine, not put on, before the sync was found and we talked and talked and talked. i had not lost them at all but merely just needed time to know them again. and the thing that struck me the most was when someone said that it was hard to just forget. that we had grown up together, lost together, learnt together and cried together. and though we're all in different stages, different parts of the world, that no matter where we are or where we'll ever be that these nails in my heart are embedded forever and love is how we'll stay together. we're all strange and kooky and crazy and silly but it is those things that you hold dear, it is that brainless foot in the mouth responses that you'll always remember, it is the irritating continuos slap on the back that comforts you, it is that annoying high pitched cackle that makes you laugh out loud too. and i guess it was really just to tell myself that while a chapter closes that things will still be right if You hold on. if you believe.  and so i do.    urlLink  "Now she does her best to move forward, still awkwardly clutching to the hurt.

       urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink     I’ve had a nice long shower and couple of days to think about what I wanted to write in here. It isn’t exactly that I have nothing to say, but rather that I have so much I need and want to say cluttered up in my mind and I can only pray that random coherence and words will do me justice. Will do this explanation that I have pushed away for so long some sort of meaning…understanding.  I didn’t exactly want to write it this afternoon because I had dinner with him today and I wasn’t exactly sure how I would feel after that. If the same positive outlook would be replaced with a fuck this whole thing I’m hiding again persona. and I needed to write some emails that I had avoided facing up to…just things that needed to be written out and said and put into words…just things that I needed to do but didn’t know how to. I still don’t, but I tried, and lately, I’ve realized, that’s all that matters. If I try and try again.   We talked...and one of the first real things he said was ‘what did you do to yourself?’ it was that tone, that same tone he used in the hospital when I had taken more pills then I cared to, it was an I care tone and it sorta scared me yet pleased me. I have lived my whole life trying to please someone or another, trying to be things I wasn’t, masking everything I had inside because I was afraid or always told to protect myself…made to protect myself only that this time, I am truly tired and done with it. With that.   This is who I am.  I am racheal sarah. I am eighteen, and I am proud to be eighteen. I am a child, and I am an adult capable of making decisions on my own. I am afraid at times but it doesn’t mean that I will always run, I have an eating disorder, something I am not proud of and something I know, will be fixed in time. I like me, at times, yet there are others, like the last few months where I am in a rut. An indecisive turn. Where I don’t know the roads I must take and fall deeper and deeper, losing myself and losing the things I know I must fight for. Losing my dreams and hopes and aspirations…and that is a very very scary place. Because suddenly, being alone means being responsible for yourself and the things you do to yourself. Suffice to say, I handled it badly, I broke promises and broke the trust of others around me by just being mean. Or cold. Or distant. Provoking a reaction that could hurt. Provoking others around me to leave, to go away, telling them I wanted to be alone…needed to be alone. Wanting to see the person I had become, wanting to see the demons in me I unleashed.   And so I did.   I went away and the first couple of days felt like eternity. The part where your flight takes off and paranoia sets in and suddenly you remember all the things you needed to do and say and worrying if it’s too late now. And you dwell on everything, on every event, and it plays and replays in your mind, that every significant turn and crossroad that made you you. And somewhere in the midst of that, you realize you’re just you. That no one is perfect. That perfection was fairy tale to a child’s eye yet perfection also came with acceptance. And so as days turned into nights you found little things about yourself you never knew and rediscovered others. You found that somewhere deep in you, you still could love and be loved. That somewhere deep in you, you knew you were loved and all you had to do was open your eyes and see.  And so you saw. You saw the hurt you caused when you were hurting, you saw their arms out stretched to you, you saw the people that cared for you just you no matter who you were or what you were, and you saw that it was okay to trust and it was okay to believe in people. That it is okay to believe in yourself because that’s the most important part of it all. To cross that mountain because you know you can. But most of all, it was knowing that you had made a mistake, and that people make mistakes and that you were willing to fix it.  This is my attempt at fixing it. At saying I’m sorry for the person I became. I was going to call this a new beginning but it is really an ending to eight months of ups and downs and in betweens. Of eight months of trying to find myself. Of eight months of giving and taking. The end of this month truly signifies a new beginning. One which I have longed for and thought of for a long long time.  When I didn’t get to nz, I thought it was merely just me being stupid and emotional and using my ass to think but I see now that perhaps I made the right decision after all. That everything I have always said about how time mends all things is true after all. And so here I am, eight months later, having been at places and stages I never would have been had I gone, learning and loving, believing and trusting, letting go and moving on.  I wrote  urlLink this  about a month ago and it made a lot of people question and upset but it was what I felt and what I had written as a source of theraphy. As a way of understanding or at least trying to make sense. It all does now. I know where I’m at and I know where I am heading. I know the things I want and I know the goals I will strive to achieve.  Yet there is a big fat But in it.   It isn’t that I will never have a bad moment again, and it isn’t that I am super confident that everything will work out but rather I am ready for anything that might come and more acceptable to anything that might not. That I need to take this step forward and try my very best to not look back or at least not run back to this hole and cry just because it is comforting and perhaps when I am in here, everything bad is expected and so ironically, it is easier. But what I've realised is that the better person, the person I want and hope to be takes this challenge and faces up to it. Fighting to the last breath and not giving up halfway. Believing in myself and perhaps, trusting in the big guy up there to have things in control and that I can only dictate so much and plan so much for truly it is only up to the hands of fate to decide. The gods above. Destiny.  And so I will run to my destiny with a smile and an open heart...understanding what is not mine to take and accepting the things and lessons and people that envelop me even if it hurts a while.     Here’s to life again, for everything it’s worth.  200 and 2 percent.  hugs.    urlLink "she broke my heart and ruined my life. hope that answers that."

      i guess many people know me better than i do...because much as i REALLY :) tried to stay away..lol, i'm back. so my so called yet well worth 'intermission' was short lived by the sudden need to come online and write a long ass post and talk about myself. :P  where the hell have i been?   i don't quite know really. so many places and back. so so many things has happened since july the first and it's hard to believe that it has only been sixteen days. there was a little scare of a heat stroke in between but after a proper rest and lots of tlc, we were both back on our feet, on the sand and enjoying the breeze. this is all the reasons why i want to live near the beach again. :) but a bay will do i suppose...i am excited, oh wait, make that assholically crazy excited to go back...it's been so long and getting in touch with all the people i used to know and talking to them again has sorta quenched a lot of the fears i had. thank you mom and dad.   i did a crazy thing yesterday. i can't exactly say it was a spur of the moment thing because i went in there with an appointment and everything and said work your magic! hehe, five painfully long hours later (yes, vanity, thy name is woman blah blah) i came out with a wonderfully textured extremely short cropped streaked two toned hair. as said earlier, photo evidence will come later! be warned though, it's  s h o r t !  we picked up the new ford linux?..lynx? whatever the hell it is...c a r yesterday for the mib promotion and it was ass funny because it really just looks like any other normal car untill of course you put one bum at the drivers seat and let him take you to the track and see what his baby can do. i know now all the reasons why a safety belt is so damn important :P   oh, then we also tried to lure  urlLink jasmine  out, dumbfully not realizing that she doesn't work in the building anymore. of course it only turned out to be funny for me. but in any case, it was really really good food. i normally don't really rant about what i eat y'know? i'm  particular  but i don't gush over shit ass great tasting food like i'm about to. and it was cheap! well, relatively anyway...and there is nothing more malaysian and kiasu than having mouth watering lobsters that are cheap and good! heheh...though the picking thing you use to take out the 'succulent' flesh thing really reminded me of the same thing gibson used to pick out the strands of hair to be streaked from the cap (instead of the alluminum foil way-lah) and so much for that, i had dessert soon after.  :)  other "big thing" than being back in this place with a dodgy layout is that i purchased a domain the other night. wa ha ha ha. everything is still sorta under wraps but a hot sexy dude with immense unbelievable graphic capabilities has been manipulated into designing it for me. lol, all i can say is that it looks really good and i'm piss excited! the space at  urlLink thewarmcompany  from  urlLink chris  will still work as the main ftp-ing place something though...i'm not too sure about the 'technical' side of it seeing as i'm pretty crap with the whole html side of it but basically it's a blog cum personal space cum kids update cum friends join thing with some pretty nifty shit and it's all good honey! ehhe..but i should just keep my toes crossed and not build castles in the air eh?   and if none of that just made sense, go  urlLink give    urlLink money!    i'm sorta caffiene and pretty good day induced right now minus the fact that i really really need to pee but can't step away because i KNOW that this stupid thing won't be here when i'm back so yeah...but rest assured though, you'll get serious more mellow racheal tonight. in other words, i have a nice long essay and shit of the last few days/weeks/months/years all in my mind but have no patience or time or sense to write it now lah!   so i leave you with photos...bad photos. burnt cow, bitches and wet feet photos. big huge asses too.    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink     urlLink    urlLink      urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink      urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink      urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink      urlLink    urlLink          urlLink "Writing is like religion.

      don't even wnat to talk about the hurt...maybe because we've talked about it so many times it's pointless now, maybe because it just makes it more painful, like rubbing salt on the wound.   you said it wasn't love. perhaps that stings most of all, as opposed to we lost us, as opposed to we just fell apart, as opposed to just don't know each other anymore because then i guess that we never had anything to start with then. you tell me you don't need me anymore, you tell me my words don't hurt you, and you tell me i'm all the same, that i havent changed, you say things and you say them and it hurts. it hurts right there, right where tears or anger or fear doesn't even come close.  remember when we talked? remember when i found it hard to say words because i was crying so much, remember when you said it was okay for me to trust you again. remember when you said those words i didn't want and didn't need to hear, remember that night, remember how i told you this would happen but you wouldn't listen, well it happened only that what i percieved then is nothing like what it is now. it is a million times worst with your words ringing in my ear and my heart twisting and choking on my sobs and trying so hard to hide it all in.  i really don't know you anymore. i almost thought i had us figured out, see, i told you not to tell me things, i told you not to make me need you, why did you make me trust you? why did you make me need you? love? you're telling me it doesn't exist, you're telling me that everything that has happened is a lie, is not real, perhaps you win the big fat ribbon then becuase i don't even know what it is anymore. why am i hurting so much and how come i can't numb it?  you, you were my best friend. you were my hero, my knight, the person that puts his hand over my heart and heals it, the person that tells me things are going to be okay, the person that makes me laugh when i'm tired of the world, you were my friend.  now you're, i don't know who you are anymore. now everytime i think about you it hurts. now, you tell me mean things and you tell me you hate me and you tell me things about myself i wish i never told you, now you make me hate me, now you make me sick of us. now, you make me cry.  now, it all just hurts.  it's your birthday today. i didn't send anything. didn't say anything. your gift sits wrapped and ready to be sent out in the corner. i found your cd and i think that maybe perhaps love went into making that but then maybe not because you hate me now, but then maybe not beause you tell me it was just a phase and that you were just confused and that everything was not as it seemed. i want to break the cds, i've already torn your letters, already deleted every conversation with you, already trashed every email, i hold it and it's so hard.   i don't know how to get rid of you. how to get you out of my system. i need to forget you and forget we ever existed and forget all of us but then i keep on tripping on myself and falling.   you got upset because i mailed you an email telling you i wanted you in my life. you got upset because i wrote you and you asked me why i was rehashing the past when we could just bury it and start from wherever. because the past was where i felt most secure, because the past is where i ever felt close to you, or knew you, because the past is where i ever felt like you actually liked me, because the past is where i ever felt like i meant something to you or that you actually really wanted me around, before it all changed. before everything changed.  i tell you it's different you say it's not. i tell you about changing and changes, you tell me it's all the same. i try to tell you things happening within me but you will never forgive me, never accept me anymore. so instead you react by telling me i'll always be the same, the same disgusting whore, you tell me i'm just the same and i never change, reminding me your thoughts and takes on me, i don't need to read it, i don't need to see it, i know it by hard, i know what you think of me, you tell me those are just stupid moments when you're angry with me but it's what you think..what you still think, what you will always think of me.  it's like spears that cut right through you and restab again and again. like icicles that frostbite you. ironically, you've changed me so much.   i don't know what i'm doing here. on your side of the world. i don't know why things remind me of you, or why i see you in buildings and faces, i don't know why i miss you or that i wish you were here, i don't know why the other extreme takes over and i never want to see you, i don't know why i don't even want to ever step into where you're at let alone hold a conversation with you again. i don't know why i write things like this, maybe just so i know how i feel and write it out to understand then hopefully forget all about it the next day. maybe i do this to exhaust me so i finally get some sleep.  i miss you jared. i miss us. i said your name.   i love you even if you don't love me and never loved me or whatever it was. i care but it hurts so much to care. if i could, i would hold you, just to feel you and know that we were real or that some part of us actually existed. if i could, i would ask you to save me tonight, ask you to not be mean tonight and not say the things you say and just not hurt me tonight, if i could, i would tell you but i can't.   i can't because you won't hear it. i can't because everything i say comes out tainted to you. i can't because everytime i think of you or look at you or try to tell you something it hurts. because i'm so so afraid of you coming close and ripping it all apart again, because i'm afraid if you tell me all those things and take it back again. i can't because i know i'm not worth it, i can't becaus ei know you deserve better, i can't becaue i know you want me to fuck off.  i lost you.  it hurts a lot.

       end the damn thing already.   i woke up last night and had a good cry. it was tiring and frustrating but it was something i needed to do. it hurt so much but then i suppose that you hurt so much to a point where it's just numb and i hope i reach that point soon. this is exactly where we've been before, i don't even know why i tried again. i don't believe in you or us but most of all, i don't believe in me, and that hurts a lot. how oculd you tell me those things and make me feel safe and secure and give me those things to hurt me so bad? why is it you? who are you and what did we have and who am i and why did i ever trust you? damn you, damn you for putting me here again, i was doing fine ..alright..i was doingokay why did you shatter everything?  i am so sick of everything it literally makes me sick. i keel and curl up at the thought of anyone coming this close again. i like this barrier it's safer than being scarred alive. i'm bleeding, i'm broken, im hurting, fuck you for telling me you'd never do this. for saying the things you said and doing the things you did. i'm me, and i'm human, and i have feelings, and i can break.   i dont want to ever come close to anyone again. i don't want to ever tell anyone how i feel or what im feeling or be honest or transparent. i like my layers, i like hiding, i like people not knowing how i feel and people not coming too close to know where it hurts the most. i hate myself, but i don't hate me as much as knowing that you wlaked away because i was who i was with you. that when you stripped me away and found me you turned away and told me how disgusting i was. you will never know how much that hurts. you will never know how you shattered everything i ever believed in and stole trust or faith or love from me or whatever the hell it was. i don't even know what it was. do you know what it's like to not know what it was?  all the other times i turn around and tell you and everyone else that i'm going to be fine. that i will take whatever shit life hands me and i will and i will tell you this time that i don't need you and i don't need anyone that i am just fine alone but that i also want to do this just alone. i don't want anybody and i don't want to need anybody. if that makes me selfish and hateble and bitchy and an asshole to be around with then so what's new? call me names, laugh at me, tlak about me, make fun of me, it's all the same now, it still hurts but i'm getting used to this hurt and i just have to ignore it and put it away and i will be fine. it's a painful reminder but it keeps me safe and okay for the future. so i don't need anyone for the furture and know why.   i don't know what possesed me to think that things will be okay. i don't know what possesed me ever to think that i could trust you or that i was safe with you because in the end you're just like the rest of them. i'm sorry i let you see this part of me, i'm sorry i let you see a lot of things and told you a lot of things, i was mean but you were too. i'm winding up, putting this away, starting again. funny how i am here but i have no desire to be anywhere near you at all, i don't want to ever listen to your promises or the things you say because we had our conversation, and we talked but i guess it was just talk to you then. i showed you whatever and you walked away again. your very last sentence hurt so much more than anything in the whole wide world, you'll never know why but it cut right there, right where it would hurt the most.  you did know where after all. i wish you never.   and so this is it. the ending for a new beginning. i don't need lies, i don't need anyone and i certainly don't ever need to tell people how i feel anymore. i'm sorry i'm taking this down yet not sorry at all. perhaps i'll keep a part of me just for me after all, take care of yourselves.  i meant to come back here and start again but i realize i need change and this isn't helping the slightest bit. life is a damn bitch but guess i just have to deal with it then.  you'll do just fine, that much i know.   whatever really, people don't change. they just get fucked up inside then fuck up outside too. and we all know what a huge fuck up i am. god knows, you've told me enough of times. so this is ending it, i moved, i ran away, i packed my bags and left and i'm never ever stepping in here again, i am never letting myself get vulnerable or ever trusting anyone again, why? because it's not worth it. nothing is worth it, that much we all know.   and so it ends.

      he told me to open my eyes and reach for beyond what my mind could ever imagine. i laughed, snickered, smiled our secret smile as if to say, i understood yet i was wary(weary) then took a deep breath, spread my wings and  flew  soared.   it has been so good to be back here (malaysia!). the last few years have inched forward and sped by. multiplying and teaching me so many lessons and things i could never even begin to describe nor tell you. they were like treasures interwoven into one another, each unleashing it's own magical powers through the hands of time.   this whole week alone has signified many new beginnings and tied up a vast amount of endings....there are people i will never forget, that have touched my life in their own special ways and have forever marked their place in my heart. i cherish, and am grateful for all the moments and times lost in eternity spent making those. xie xie.  it's hard to imagine that a week from now i will be back across oceans to a place i once knew. i am terribly excited, yet just a little intimidated by the roads before me, "make the right decisions racheal, make the god damn right decisions!"...but yet before that i will see grandma, very possibly for the last time. it is hard sometimes to say goodbye but it is inevitable. i will miss her just as i will miss a lot of life here too.   take care of yourselves you hear me? i should be back here by the eighteenth or so with a new design(!), stories to tell, retardedness to share and bullshit to phantom. so in the meantime do the chicken dance and go bug these fantastic people...  hugs!      urlLink  +  a small victory  urlLink  +  angela  urlLink  +  austin  urlLink  +  barbtries  urlLink  +  bottled bliss  urlLink  +  brickchick  urlLink  +  brooklynkid  urlLink  +  chris  urlLink  +  closetboy  urlLink  +  cracks in the pavement  urlLink  +  daria  urlLink  +  darkmoth  urlLink  +  devon  urlLink  +  digital kara  urlLink  +  digitalnap  urlLink  +  empress  urlLink  +  evan  urlLink  +  fredshead  urlLink  +  ghostcassette  urlLink  +  gray, looking like an ashtray.  urlLink  +  jared  urlLink  +  jasmine  urlLink  +  jay  urlLink  +  josh  urlLink  +  loveisabitch  urlLink  +  lovesadrug  urlLink  +  manicmoods  urlLink  +  mark spark*  urlLink  +  mighty mitch  urlLink  +  missing pieces  urlLink  +  moby  urlLink  +  mystery mona  urlLink  +  nadablog  urlLink  +  planting impatients  urlLink  +  reality remixed.  urlLink  +  rion  urlLink  +  sandee  urlLink  +  screw me  urlLink  + shaynanagins.  urlLink  +  sze  urlLink  +  s!ren  urlLink  +  subinev  urlLink  +  tim  urlLink  +  tinman  urlLink  +  tom  urlLink  +  torn wide open  urlLink  +  trabaca  urlLink  +  wil wheaton  urlLink  +  wishful thinking      "the smile on your face is the light in the window that tells people you're home.."

       urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink     yes, you're shit out of luck because i'm still here.   i'm quite afraid that should i play my scratched up album of screaming teen angst and an eclectic mix of the sappiest most pathetic ballads my neighbours might snap. bad. because i've only played it all morning and yesterday night. oops.  and if you look at the time and the fact that it's monday then you should have had it all figured out that we didn't get to the beach. which i really did sorta expect except that well, i was kinda looking forward to it. i think. (sorry)  in other news though, i think i got a lot of shit settled somewhere in between friday night and three hours ago. it feels like i have felt every extreme since then and i'm not bitter anymore, just merely unfeeling.   i wrote a lot of things earlier about i felt but then realized that i am at no liberty to talk about it. in fact, i might have already spoken too much.   things are going to okay. and today, that's all i really care about.   urlLink  "the heart believes in something else that the logical, calculating mind knows to be true. that i can't carry this forever. that, while you have no spiritual believes at all, and that it may bring you no peace, it must be said. to bring peace to itself. it knows that even though it makes no real difference, that it brings you no closer, and perhaps even pushes you further, that it must come to pass.  you are forgiven."

      i am wheezing. it's not very serious but it's frustrating. very very frustrating.  it's like a ten pound fat chicken on my chest restricting my airflow.   i also have a headache. i took an aspirin but all it's really done is just dull my senses and made me sleepy.  i tried to go to bed...but lying down just makes it harder to breathe. i am giving it half an hour more before i tell my parents.  this is not going to be fun.   i still want to go out tommorow!  and no way in hell are they going to allow us to drive out to the beach if i'm sick. damn you acupuncture. you were supposed to make me feel good. argh.   my inhaler is being an ass. i don't want to overpuff that i might shake. but then me wheezing here doesn't help either. i really don't feel like putting together the nebulizer(sp?) either.   fuck you weather.   it's all your fault.   so in the mean time, i'm going to think happy thoughts and ley bryan entertain me while hopefully my berotec will start kicking in.  so fucking frustrating.   gahhh

       urlLink    urlLink    urlLink     so apparently last nights dinner didn't go down quite as well as it was supposed to. in a bid not to consume anything too foreign(she suggested pate! *blech*) and strange we stuck with potato lamb and wine.   ...but guess who woke up with sarajevo in her tummy?  ah..but that's not the best part..  the best part being that i just realized i've been taking  urlLink banned  substances.  uhuh.   because i went out to get some and the lady gave me a funny look then carefully explained to me that it was bad fr you. oh yeah, like now you tell me.   pah.   crazy druggies.   and now it feels like i am coming down with something thanks to the shitty poluted air.   p/s this morning i woke up in another bed, i fell asleep last night in the guest room somewhere in between the hundredth trip to the bathroom and the telly is bigger in this room so then it was disorientating as i tried to remember all of last nights events, i remembered something vague of an email i received, then snippets of conversations that took place last night, i remembered the city lights and the drunk scantily clad girls, then i remembered posting in the middle of the night last night. amidst some stupor of 'getting the truth' out. so then i did the next best thing i knew what to do, rush in here to delete it. see, it's easier to just sweep things underneath the carpet, get it out for that moment then collect it back the next day..i question if i am using my blog to say things again. everytime people write me they always tell me how insanely honest it is, how fucking private it can get..and i keep on hearing these things, people keep on remarking but i'm just thinking how i've lost so much of innocence. how my very first blog compared to this has so drastically changed. how very possible too that i might have changed.   some days i think this change is so good. yet some days like today i wonder where that part of me went.   is she still somewhere in me or did i lose her in between all the questioning?  i look at my stats and see all these people. it's a nice feeling yet it's also really like 'oh fuck, i'm overexposing'. sometimes i think i blog to one specific person, sometimes i blog to no one at all, sometimes i blog just because.   it's time for a redesign. i am so tired of this layout. i hate it when i have images in my head but they don't transcribe on paper(screen.)  i am thinking of a hiatus too. you think, so fucking soon?   i say just till get my bearings right. when i settle down so i don't end up posting mad insane stupid posts for the next whole week because i've just realized last night too that it is my last week. and i'm looking at my schedule and thinking how am i going to fit in all these people, how am i going to tell them all how much they mean to me, how am i going to say goodbye.   i have banned specific people from the airport, we have agreed to say our separate goodbyes, i have might even banned goodbyes.   but the strange thing is, i like the thought of going away and starting again. my ass is itching from all the beautiful sunsets i've missed and my rooooooom, and all my bloody things that have already been sent there, i think about all the people i can't wait to meet and going back to school! oh my god have i missed being educated, have i missed learning something substantial that did not have to do with how i feel or emotions, have i missed just doing assignments..doing something with a point and not letting my brains rot away.  damn, i am such a nerd.  but you know what? i am. i am a stupid nerd. a pseudo uber geek because i've been taking lessons. :P  i'm glad i'm going home. i'm glad for this change. i'm glad i'm rewriting. i'm glad there are second chances. i'm glad i make mistakes so i learn from them.   i'm glad i'm going to be okay alone.   actually, i'm just glad i'm going to be okay, whether or not alone.   thank you you for making me realize that this morning. thank you for mad insane fucks that force you to rethink and rehash your whole entire life and don't let you go back to sleep. thank you for people just behind eery nook and corner.   and now i'm sappy so i'll shut up.

      i want to piss you off so you go away.  i might be very close already, possibly even pushing it.  i don't know why, it is just like before, me testing you again.  please break please break.  i am afraid to trust you.  ...please break. please break.  are you broken yet?  will you scream at me now?  will you hurt me so i can bleed?  can i cry for a reason now?  what's the fucking point again?  i'm afraid.

I do not suppose you would be interested in knowing about my day, or how things went or what I did. Because I’m not either.  I am interested in what I want to do for the rest of my life. I am interested in world peace and conservation. I am interested in the children of the world, of today and tommorow. I am interested in making things right yet the focus is recklessly abandoned, easily wavered. I am interested in fixing things, between us, between me and him, between me.

It is the kind that gets beneath your skin and penetrates your mind.  Your click on my voice box hurts. It would have been easier had you just slammed the phone down, your terse voice that tells me to have a good day is bitter. You are angry. I know why but I am angry too. You know how I feel about it, you know the problem, you know how it all works…then tell me why this is still upsetting?  I know you understand. I know you know why and I know you know how. Believe me when I say I’m trying to work it out too…believe me when I say I’d like to know what the hell I want either.    In betweens.   Just the cracks.

This sounds like one of those online rants that I hate reading I'm using our relationship to write something that is appealing Part of the failure must come from insincerity then, I mean when an amateur writer is unable to transcend the barriers of creation. I am not palatable. I am thunder and flash and a few soundbites. I am not cinematic. I am not theatrical. I am words but not images. You like what I have wrote.

I'm tired of reading the bullshit I write. I should apologize for the whining bitch I’ve been the last few days, the bout of depression I’ve wringed myself through, the ugly side of me I’ve exposed. Yet again. The road not taken but the past revealed again. I have no explanation.   They say change would take place, they say I will go through phases and mature. Somehow I still feel like a dorky insecure kid, my very words here underlilne the doubts in me. What if I have no talent at all, no forte. What if I’m a mesh of bullshit, what if I have but not enough?  Confused. Disorientated. Lost.  Here I go again.  -  I write this the next morning, I fell asleep on this.

We go out and party, we socialize, we make do as if everything is alright, we laugh as if joy comes freely from our soul, we smile as if the world is beautifully serene, concealing all the turmoil that is within. Concealing because it is easier to not explain or concealing because you don’t trust yourself with them or then again, concealing just because.  Yet the world is still perfect, is still beautiful.   Hope still surges on despite all that is happening. Today is a new day, all my tommorow worries for yesterday are here today but yet I am still here, still standing.   Somehow, things might just be alright.    Somehow today is just today, somehow I am just a small part of the world, somehow, my problems are only as big as I make it, somehow, small steps make the world.

      my day started out brilliant with my sun roof deciding to fuck up on me then subsequently, rain. yes, it's crazy ass hot for a good whole week and the one day my sun roof decides to die on me it bloody rains. damn, i must  really  be pissing off someone above.   ahh..but that will not deter me for i went in (afuckinggain!) to get stabbed. :) of course i just squeezed my eyes super tight and chanted and chanted and chanted till they stuck everything in and we played video games till it was over. all good honey! i'm not really sure what todays session was for though, because unlike yesterday where i was anally sensitive, today, the voices in my head blocked the doctors whatever out completely. i also happen to have that god damn bishi bashi theme song in my head i swear i'm going insane.   we're starting on me lungs on monday. oh hell yeah this is going to be fun.   :P  in other news though, it's a friday night!  grace wants to go get dinner at some new place she found.  my brother wants to go clubbing.  chris wants to go for some short film festival blah thing downtown.  auntie jesse wants me to go for cg. (mmhmm)  steve wants me to make chicken soup. lol :P  and i...want to go to bed.   i'm sleeeeeepppyyyyyy.  why the hell do i have a feeling that i will do none of the above?   urlLink  "No..

      i might have majorly worried a few people last night. i don't know what possesed me but i lost it, it's almost funny now, still kinda stings but good to know that i'm still breakable. i really don't know why i had such a bad night because essentially, it was a pretty good day. there was a lot more of tears after that post but they were tears i needed to get out..it felt like there was so much pressure bottled up or soemthing. in any case, things are...i don't know, strange right now, trying to find my balance, will get there eventually i suppose.  in another realm completely though and almost uncharacteristic of me, i went in for alternative theraphy today. the method of torture? acupuncture. it was...interesting. i generally don't like needles but then someone suggested that it might help and so we went in and got it done. i freaked out for a good half an hour before anything really happened but i was still piss terrified none the less. nothing like watching needles stuck down you and connecting volts to it.   i still believe it's all in the mind, but oh well, if it makes me parents happy.  i didn't really feel like doing anything today. to be honest, i wanted to just get away from everything. i think i got burnt out from so much activity and thinking in the last few weeks that i might have tired myself out physically too. and you know that when you're tired just about everything else is wrong too.   but then sakthi and archana came over. i forgot i made plans last week so we just went and got dinner. it was nice to be with them. it's nice to be with old friends you know? people that have known you for what seems to be like your whole entire life. when i'm with them i almost feel unjudged, it's just a nice comfortable feeling. it's almost strange how possibly that might have been what i really needed tonight. just us girls against the world. just us, just me, and i can be sad if i want to or i can be bitchy or just cranky and i know it will be alright. they almost numb the pain if even for a just a bit.  we're going to watch hooverstan(?) next week at hard rock. i don't even know the bands name but apparently they're good. and even if they're not we have to get arch a single hot chick with mind blowingly amazing positions. possibly even an orgy too. i'm just going to shut up and smile, me opening my mouth has caused me quite a bit of trouble the last few days.   right now, david is trying to convince me to go to hk for the weekend. in all honesty, it doesn't seem like such a bad idea but then i don't really want to do that either. running away merely just multiplies the confusion and mess. that much i've learnt. so how to get to the root and fix it?  beats the shit out of me.    urlLink  "She wanted him.

       night falls.  i wonder what it would be like to kiss the sky and dance among the stars. floating hazily in between consciousness and swiftly  wading in between dreams. seeing people, faces; things i use to know but they don't connect. i recognize, but it is only familiar,  deja vu, but nothing significant. nothing i really  know .   good days and bad days. ups and downs. inside and out. open and in. honest and hiding. things will be okay, they have to be,  they must be.   i cry when i hear your voice, it tells me not to cry. your will to protect me pushes me away further, i am scared of life today...i  cannot do this. courage: what the fuck is that? no, but i am strong, i am strong, i am fine, i will get through this, i am always good,  i am fine, things will be right, it is okay.  i toss and turn wanting and forcing my mind to shut down and sleep but i feel the tears well up behind my eyes and i hold tighter  and tighter, and breathe deeper and deeper, and then i let go. sob. again. why baby, why?  fanfuckingtastic show. perfect. utter brilliance. but i don't see your face. i don't get your congratulatory hug. i don't get your laugh  that rings in my ear, i don't hear your voice, i don't see your face.   i am alone.  auditorioum. people. friends. dates.  still alone.   but i wanted this didn't i?  un-attached. single. open relationship, hell yeah.  but still alone.   and that's good right?

       carys.   You think the images might fade one day…some day, it will all be over you tell yourself, things are really okay, just look for the good, just look for the good. You watch their faces, so damn innocent, you watch and you guide and you find and search for all the things in you to make things right but you have no bandaids, no miracle cures, nothing to stop the pain or the tears so you cry with them and hold them close and tell them it’s all going to be okay, that things are alright and you be strong even if you have no idea, you pretend, you piece their jigsaws back together and mend the broken hearts because you know fixing them fixes you too.   Things change around you, you adapt, swim or sink, life goes on whether you like it or not…days pass and months go by and things can go so wrong and so right together and all at once in a go so you look out for the good days and bury the bad ones. You learn to let pieces in you go even if it hurts so much, you know you need to do the things you need to do even if everything is harder this way, you try and bleed and try again. You cannot give up, no, life is too short for that.   And then you find the ones you love and tell them how much they mean to you. And then you find the ones you’ve hurt and tell them how sorry you are. And then you find the ones you don’t like but become real friends anyway because you remember what you were taught as a child, to treat others exactly the way you would like to be treated and you ask yourself what would jesus do and what is right and how to fix things even if honesty hurts so very bad, you look deep in you and learn to fix the things you can and accept the things you cannot.   It is a violent game of extremities, at times you think you will go insane from all the pressure, at times you think it would be so much easier to just give up but you realize you cannot, and you realize how wrong you are, how hypocritical it would be…you realize how you’ve been here before but how you never followed through. You promise yourself to make it this time, you promise yourself change and rainbows, you promise yourself hope.   Hope is a beautiful amazing feeling; I forget sometimes. At times I think I should learn to deal with criticism a whole lot better, and at times I think about how I am too proud. I want to say that to love someone is to love it for everything it is but then again, how exactly do you love something that is unlovable? I am tired of thinking and questioning and at times I wish my mind would just give me a break and at times, it does. Too bad I forget those moments and focus on the wrong things.   The bay was extremely peaceful today. I took out all the tealights I had and lit them up one by one and let it float. It was so serene and calming, I could not hide my tears and so I let myself cry, I cried like a little baby because it was so beautiful, I cried because right at that moment, I knew things were going to be okay no matter where it ends or where life takes me now. I don’t know what the future holds for me tomorrow nor do I know how today would end, I am scared and a little intimidated of what is before me and all that I have left behind but just like someone told me a long time ago, you gotta grab the bull’s horns by it’s goddamn balls and screw them.   I am not perfect. I never will be. And so when I strive for perfection I need to remember that no one is either. I have been asked to sing ‘God Bless the USA’ for the memorial service this Wednesday. Sometimes I wonder if all this is really happening, I sit through rehearsals and think how surreal it all feels, they play the clips and I am numb. I wonder if that makes me cold or if I just don’t know how to process it. In a room filled with different ethnicities, race, color, gender, and age, I wonder if I am alone or if I am one of them. I tell myself I have too many fears, that I worry too much….i worry if I break down on Wednesday, I worry about what to say to the kids, I worry about what to say to the adults, I worry if they ask me anymore about muslims, I worry if they’ll hate me, I worry if I’ll fuck up, I worry everything to death and back but it still doesn’t stop me from worrying. I think too much.   I guess I just came back to say that I love you. And you. And you.   That each and everyone of you is special and beautiful and loved whether I know you or not. If you came in, you either came in because you were looking for some machoistic entry that is always promised here or because you cared. Either way, I love you in anyway. Sept 11 taught us a thing or two, remember the promises you made that day, remember the dreams you need to fulfill and know that it will come true someday. I am just one small stupid person in a huge universe filled with every different color, touch and smell but you make up a part of my world and I believe in you.   I guess then that I am really shutting this place down for good. It is bittersweet but not a bad thing…I am learning to trust myself, god forbid, love myself. It is an interesting battle. I am growing up…now isn’t that scary?   Take care of yourselves and please know that if you ever need anything or just a friend, I hope you know and would consider me one too. Be good because the angels are still watching…do something nice for humanity today okay?   Corny, but we still need world peace.   Everything is going to be okay…it has to be and it will be, I know.    sing jie pao chu ni.    *hugs*

       note to self: do not, under any circumstances at all, ever attempt to put together a halloween costume 27 hours before. almost if not eeriely like christmas shopping the day before christmas.   collectively, we were going to go as a group.  first we came out with  scooby doo  characters...which got tossed out right around the time we realized no one really wanted to be doo at all.  then there was  captain planet.   and  archie.   and  smurfs.   and  snoopy.   and even them  disney characters.   then we thought, hey, since we're all dumb artsy people we'll go as musicals.   rent : too fucking overdone.   cabaret:  slips and bras?   rocky horror show:  white bra, glitterry stuff, lots of ass.   carousel:  inside joke and only the cast members will get...besides, no way in hell is our propmaster going to risk us destroying the costumes one week before opening.   little miss sunshine:  what the fuck?  so then we went back to the concept of just normal halloween type things...but the girls wanted to be pretty and the guys wanted to be, well, guys.  so this is what we came out with..   spice girls:  we had three chicks and two guys in our little circle of people that stuck their asses up their heads in other things then realized halloween was tommorow. the guys debated being transvestites but guess which side didn't win?   moulin rouge:  too much ass, too much booty and hell that's some damn fucking  body  fats we're showing. fantastic idea though.   pimps and whores:  doesn't that answer the suggestion itself?   cheerleading squad:  not funny at all.   ravers:  neon very very bright.   gothic shit:  only about everything and everyone's theme this year   hackers:  inlines?   buffy:  not hot enough   christina aguilera through phases:  the scarf, the genie, the whore.   madonna through phases:  i don't care anymore, it's six and we have an hour.  so the final end product after five painfully tedious long hours, six hundred and seventy shops and four thousand and six times back into it; we're hookers cum sluts cum ravers cum rocky horror show meets jerry springer thrashy things.  (now hey, wasn't the point of halloween to dress as far away possible as you are again? :P )   lol, and so i have neon blue punk highlighted hair, a kick ass butterfly glittery top in which i realize i have absolutely no and retarded boobs, held together by what hopefully is two very strong pieces of string and black pants with slits in them to reveal my  neon  cyan blue fishnet stockings and heels.  hell yeah.   amanda  has neon purple pink and silver hair, kinky kinky 'keep-it-down-boy' victoria secrets lacy type corset top and very sexy leather shorts/skirt(she hasn't decided), black fishnet stockings and some kick ass boots and hoochie mama boobs.   cory  has...the most hideous ever pink bathrobe type material dress with some sort of strange white collar, neon yellow cum lime green hair, same neon colored fish net stockings and pink fluffy slippers with hearts on them because it is close to impossible to look for a size twleve women shoes that look cute below the cost of twenty dollars.   jessica and will  left early for rehersals but apparently they're coming as the dj and cabaret dancer.   we were going to go trick or treating but rehersals starts at six and only ends at ten and i have classes before so there goes that idea..we will be bringing candy for the kids to trick or treat around the cast though. :)  no specific plans but hell a lot of places to fit, oh, only about sixty people. oops.  camera comes out tommorow!  :)  i haven't celebrated halloween in so long it's almost ridiculous. hehe.  but now, back to the thesis.  gah.  p/s because i thought it should be announced, i'm fucking tired.

      it rained last night; it poured.  [10/28/2002 5:32:33 PM | + racheal]   monday came, and left and somewhere between it all i gained an extra hour..though i can't explain it something happened. weird feelings meshed together with thoughts and actions but it's all still very surreal, the whole outer body experience cum deja vu like feeling.   monday was shit. must have been the universal day to feel like crap all day and hate the world.  ...i let three people cry on my shoulder and wiped away more tears than i cared too. monday, i was unemotional and numb. some spark in me fused or burnt out but i did not feel, and that scares me much more than being overemotional. i wanted to cry but the tears would not come, wanted to feel the pain but just emptiness remained.  monday, i know now my little problems are almost nothing compared to the heavy load others have to bear. while i am worried about my stupid dumb feelings, someone else is worried about their next meal. while i am worried about my body and getting my nails done, someone else is worried about staying alive. does that put that into perspective? a hell lot.   signs.  because last night i realized what 'family' truly meant. my dad on the phone with me at some god forsaken hour his time comforting me, my mom listening to everything i have to say because she knew that all i really needed was someone to listen. and so she did. my brother who i love with all my heart that has taken me a long while to see that he cares for me so much.   people i hurt without meaning to.   i am lost in this funny place of wanting to do what's right. growing up i guess, all these damn responsibilities and pressure. i am stressed, i am up my ass in trying to control every single fine damn detail of my life.   but i can't.  i have to trust someone and trust the people around me and trust god.  ...but what if i don't want to?  i don't know what i want exactly. i just have the rough draft, a hazy idea and it's like that last ten minutes of reaching somewhere, like waiting in line for the tickets you've waited to get your hands on the whole day, like knwoing something is wrong but not knowing what exactly.  i want my 'exactly'. i want instructions that come with a 101 book. i want to fucking understand, that's what i want.    "i shall never believe that god plays dice with the world"

       end of the bargain.  maybe because i'd like to think that somewhere out there the world stopped turning and people aren't watching and words didn't hurt.  get out of my world.

       who's your bitch?  i am trying to decide if i should laugh my ass off or whine the hell away. (i have a pretty good feeling that i'll be able to do both..but anyway)  he says all the right things and does all these unbelievably sweet things like the  urlLink teddy bear  and  urlLink roses  and coffee and waffle bloody house and just crazy ass nice guy stuff that sometimes makes me want to scream and jump on him yet i want to go like you're too fucking good for me, i'm going to tear you rip you change you and i don't want that responsibility, don't want to hurt you or lose you thing. yet at the same time i am happy with him but there's something missing..or something is wrong?   we talked last night and in retrospect, it went really well, but if i have to think about it...it went terribly disastrous all at once. you know how the more honest you get the further away you feel disconnected? i don't know exactly how to pinpoint the problem...but i have a rough idea where and what it is about which doesn't help at all considering it's stupid and unexplainable.  i just need to be over it and secure with myself before i'm going to put my everything in this because i don't want to be thinking about someone else when we're together or have him deal with shit from my past you know?    oh well.  the set is coming together pretty damn well and i'll be lying if i told you i wasn't excited. it's almost an outer body experience to try and understand that our opening night is in two weeks but all at the same time i don't necessarily feel prepared enough or rehearsed enough minus the fact that i've been in rehersals every week this night but there's just ass a lot to do..plus the monologue i have to work on aptly titled 'suicide'. madness.  i just had an epiphany.   or something to that effect anyway.  ....  i. i'm writing for me, this is my place and i am safe here.  ii. i will not let you affect me.  iii. i am fucking worth it.  iv. fate just happens and so whatever will be will be..  v. patience is a damn nice virtue. (time fixes everything)  vi. i am okay, blessed, loved and going to bloody make it.  vii. unsinkable ships sank and unbreakable walls crashed, look at it as nothing is impossible rather than nothing is certain.  viii. carpe fucking diem  ix. life is beautiful.  x. my koko is pretty damn something. :)  ----  so yeah, my thoughts.   grr.  :P

       the notion.  you know how there are certain songs that remind you of specific moments and evoke these complex unexplainable feelings?  yeah.  i don't know if i am in love, or i am in love with the notion of being in love, or i am infatuated, or if it's just pure sinful lust.  today was...  confusing  tiring  frustrating  productive  eventful  okay.  or maybe beyond okay  ...yet just about three steps below that.....it's hard to explain.  somehow, between three weeks ago and now i had convinced myself that i needed to be in a relationship to keep me from going insane, not beating around the bush and stringing along bullshit nor wanting someone but not having him because you're being a bitch yet all at once just not very sure at all.  it's been going really well.   and that scares the fuck out of me.  i got all crazy panicky last night when he held me. i don't know what it was, maybe the way he was looking at me, or maybe that strange aura that enveloped us but i freaked out. i don't know, i just felt so weird, and strange. it doesn't make sense at all but i realize that i'm not really in love in love with him. or if i am i'm pissing afraid of it.  i know, i know, it's the same damn bloody story again but precisely that. fuck, if i have to go through the last god damn year again i'd rather just kill myself. it's just that in the end there is so much hurt left and so much pain that i don't know exactly if i am comfortable with having to trust someone so much or having to need someone that's going to tell me to fuck off and make me hate myself type of thing.  i don't know, it's just last night when he touched me all these alarms went off in my head and there were like flaring red light bulbs that exploded and i didn't say a single bloody solitary thing.   i worked on the set the whole day today then had rehersals so we havent really talked talked. we were supposed to go out tonight but my body feels like it's been through the wringer..hell, my mind is going crazy.  i'm just. i don't really bloody know at all.  i don't know if i came into this relationship to "move on", or if i'm prepared.  it's not a relationship, relationship. somehow, the notion of having a boyfriend right now just doesnt seem right at all yet i know he's more than just a friend. he's very special to me  ....but it's still different.  damn it.  the show opens in two weeks, the midterms went fucking well but it also means the finals are coming soon, i still have no bloody time for anything, i need a fucking ciggarette and he's coming over now.  maybe we'll just have wild explicit sex and i'll forget about everything.    hell, there's always a maybe right?  "sigh"

         i have dreams of you. sometimes i lie awake in the middle of the night fighting of tears and nausea, but all is good i still say, all is good. i wonder if the sometimes nightmares, sometimes dreams, are trying to tell me anything at all, or if, like maybe you and me, they were just a friction of my imagination. maybe, perhaps, i don't know really. back to moving on..  people tell me things. sometimes i think it's because i seem to have this cloak that makes them figure that there is nothing that they can tell me that i would have never heard before. i don't flinch, don't blink..and when all is done, smile and produce more reassuring hugs and offer another round of coffee. but i lie.  i am afraid.  i hurt me, and beat myself up, and starve abuse myself but that's just me and that's okay.   i don't know. it doesn't make sense really but i want to protect everyone and all around me. but i can't...and that's scary.  i hate hate hate vulnerability.  i just want everyone to be okay and live happy ever after and see them the way i see them and realize how damn amazing they are.  you do know how precious you are right?    urlLink "I want to drink and dance and sing, with my friends, Rick's friends; I want to burn wood and smell the smoke and piss in the sea, shout at the moon, cry at the beauty of this world and swear eternal opposition to those who would paint it with blood, again, I want to hold you my friends in my arms and circle around our wounded brother and sing and weep and shout and break the shell of the words. I'm drunk again, by god, and I'm typing with tears running down my rugged goddamn manly cheeks, and I feel so useless. I want to bellow in pain like some big dumb beast, and I want to hold my friend and tell him that he has nothing to fear."     rest in peace rick.

         [10/24/2002 1:55:41 PM | + racheal]  i need..  to get my nails done  to finish up the set  to get my damn assignments done  to work on my grammar  to rehearse my lines  to schedule the classes for my next term  to balance my checkbook  to finish up my speech  to get on a diet to get the photographs printed  all the my, my, my's and get get get's  terribly conceited now aren't we?    [10/24/2002 1:57:48 PM | + racheal]  every time i have a ciggarette i wonder how much of my lungs it blackens now  then i think about how if i'm being anal about it how i should just quit  then i do for the next six hours or so and start being a bitch  then i cave in and finish a pack  (well not really, but more so than i should have anyway)  then i start again  and think again  and so this vicious cycle fucks me up again.   now fucking indecisive are we?    [10/24/2002 1:59:10 PM | + racheal]  i smell of paint, reek of ciggarettes but am filled with hope  what a fucking oxymoron  or not really  whatever the word is anyway  i like honesty on paper  or words in this case  but it's funny to take it all back  when i think i'm boring you to death  or conscious of what i'm saying  pah  this is retarded anyway  harrumph.  back to the painting..   edited to add: you think that one year of this shit and i would have learnt how to hit 'publish' now won't you?

        my  urlLink host  is an amazing person...i don't tell him very often but once in a while, when i'm feeling lovey and nauseated, i write posts like this to tell him he's special. :)  besides, who else ass am i going to kick in literati and share gory bits of 'paramedics' with?  or yell about my day and expect him to fix the site when i've shoved it up my ass and churned out broken links and garbled html?  and who else can i go to to share the feeling of sweet ecstacy as you sit back and enjoy that fucking well earned drink and  malboro  salem light?  i think he's a cool guy...and i'm very very happy he's back.  :)   "[5/25/2002 5:14:29 AM | chris raettig] once there lived a village of creatures along the bottom of a great crystal river. each creature in its own manner clung tightly to the twigs and rocks of the river bottom, for clinging was their way of life, and resisting the current what each had learned from birth. but one creature said at last, "i trust that the current knows where it is going. i shall let go, and let it take me where it will."   p/s: i think  urlLink she  is a hot sexy amazing chick too....but don't tell anyone i said that. she might find out and kick my fat ass. :P   p/p/s  urlLink girls suck!

         i feel like god right about now...updated and fixed  *all*  the sections thank you very much. :P  ironically (i love that word!), rehersals were cancelled today so all the extra time to myself has made me deliriously happy..hehe. and this would be the part i tell you again...life is goood.  so is chocolate fudge cake.  and starbucks skinny cafe mocha.  and stupid crazy retarded rain that begins right as you step out of the car.  but most importantly, stupid retarded friends that will dance in the rain with you.   :)  and because i love filling in these stupid survey things..   i am:  happy, content, single and not looking :P   i think:  thinking is bad for you  i know:  everything changes.     i want:  to move on, to be the best person i can be, to try try again.   i have:  love, friendship and guidance.   i wish:  i understood me a little better.  i hate:  being angry with myself.   i miss:  playing with the kids  i fear:  getting hurt again, myself, the asshole i can be.  i hear:  voices in my head? :P  i wonder:  how god manages everything..i mean, that's a lot of lives to be working on..   i regret: .  fucking up  i love:  hope. (and orange juice)  i ache:  late at night when the world isn't watching...or so i think.   i care:  too much and not at all  i always:  smile even if it hurts  i am not:  perfect  i dance:   for a living  i sing:  in the shower  i cry:  when i think no one is watching  i do not always:  tell people how i feel.   i fight:  because i want to. i need to i guess, for me. i'm tired of being pushed and broken and being used, i need to do this for me now. be the person i know i can be and hopefully, be someone that has integrity, self-worth and is finally enough.  i write:   to escape  i win:  sometimes  i lose:  when i am tired of trying and give up  i confuse:  the living shit out of myself   i listen:   very rarely because i'm a stubborn idiotic selfish bitch. :P  i can usually be found:  talking to the little green men.  i need:   balance  i am happy about:  getting in the musical, moving on, making new dreams and trying again, fixing my life even if it's the six millionth time i'm doing it again, my friends and the amazing people they are, hope and the things it means to me.  i should:  get my ass off this thing and start working on my homework..hmm  have a good night..  hugs   *edited to add : oops, i lied...forgot about poetry! :P

       out on the rooftops.  ever just sit sometimes and wonder about life and all it's twists and turns?  amazing.  crazy really, but interesting.  so  urlLink he's  left. it's strange, but i'm glad he finally did it. and i hope whatever he's doing now, he's happy.  life isn't too bad you know, chisel off the crusty dirty layer...you might find something worth holding on to beneath it.   emotionally fucked is a good term to describe a lot of situations i get myself tangled into, but that's just me you see. sometimes the very things you try and run away from are the things you are made of.   my new start isn't really a big bang or anything, in fact, if i was really anal, it's pretty much the same. just trying again.   so yeah, i make mistakes. i fuck up. i fall down. big fucking deal.  :)  things are good, now hell, That's scary.  today feels strange. or maybe being content is just a whole new experience, closure somewhat does make you see clearer i guess. so does sleep.   oh yes, sleep very very good.  thinking is normally an evil thing, but i'm glad it happened today. :)  i'm so tired of being a cranky bitter bitch and to choke on my own words, life is precious and too short.  hugs   **ironically, the moment i hit publish, the site fails on me. and as forewarned, will fail quite a bit too in the coming days...pah. but the selfish bitch thanks you anyway..:P

       hey jersey  there are six things she needs right now.  she notices his eyes first. they are beautiful, like a swirl of green, gray and brown put together. she's shy, very quiet, trying to make up for it by exchanging banter with the 'common friends', she's pissing wow-ed, he asks for her name..and so the game begins. it doesn't take very long. no, not too long at all, the attraction is apparent. chemistry? damn, that's a strong word.  back and forth. each time drawing her deeper with every word he says, his intelligence draws her nearer...closer. falling to edge and it's hard to get off this ride. lights up, smiles etched too deeply on this face...a certain aura that radiates when he's near her. a certain feeling.   not wanting to screw up so bad. nice, slow and easy. they have so many conversations without words, like driving around no where and listening to music, like watching the first light of a brand new day break in or looking out into the world beyond in moonlight to the sounds of waves crashing. things he's dying to show her, new things he helps her discover every day.  he watches her. talks about her. her friends say he's a keeper. they've seen them together, they've seen him talk about her.  he sees when no one is watching. protects her if she'll let him. nights she steps out to be alone a while; she always knows there's big comfy hug waiting for her to come back into, sometimes, he finds her too. they talk about a lot of things, time flies by so fast and beyond. he drives careful, makes sure he takes her home safely each night. takes her to her favorite places, doesn't pressure her, no not at all, take your own time sweetie, it's all yours.  doesn't promise her anything. as a matter of fact, knows to avoid all conversations that veer towards subjects that make her run, he's seen her run before. he knows that feeling, she's afraid of him running, she's afraid of her running, but when they are alone, it's almost too comfortable. you have no idea how time flies.  she wishes he would talk forever, every fucking thing he says pulls her in deeper. when he talks about history or the world.things that go beyond a cute butt and a sexy body....yet it's not the talk at all. it is the person and the way his eyes look into yours, that old soul behind it that takes you back a moment, that moment where you pinch yourself and wonder, is this real? yet she still never talks about it. he's tried once, right after, the night he told her she was beautiful and she cried. the people from her past should remain there she says, and so they never talk about the past. nothing there that you need to know, men are evil, very very bad..jokes but actually believes it.   odd isn't it how things that cloud you the most inevitably become the subjects you avoid the most. he's seen her without even saying anything at all. is she transparent or is this just the magic that happens?  thier eyes lock, i don't know if a second passes by or if twenty minutes has passed already. he reaches in to kiss me and i don't know if to draw back like so many times before because this actually feels kinda nice. right almost. i like his arms around me, or the way he whispers in my ears and his breath tickles me. she's a huggy person, they've always hugged, but something has changed. the way he says i love you is different tonight. or how he picks her up and swings her around and around and around as she giggles and laughs.  how he brings her coffee or watches her at rehersals. or rings her and leaves her messages to make her laugh. how he kisses her forehead and hugs her so tight it's hard to breathe and says, 'good job baby', how she lights up when he's around. that buzz, a high.   he takes her shopping. and she shops a whole lot. how six hours later he's still smiling, offering to play another round of 'the dancing game', how he doesn't mind being goofy with her. how he doesn't mind her being goofy. or stupid. or retarded.  how they fight to pay every time and they sneak paying things. making up for things she says as his mock angry face only tickles her further. she says she's being the man so she has to be in control. secretly, she knows, she just doesn't want to fall. i don't think this is helping either.  kiss me harder, again and again. tantalize me with your mind and touch. brings his arms around my waist and plays with my hair. tickles me, breath on my shoulder and the breeze is so damn cold tonight as i get chilly and shiver. feels my tummy groan against my free will, hunger pangs invade as he pulls me in tighter. runs off and drags my fat ass to get food. the waiter laughs, 'oh it's the both of you again'.  she flinches. his finger toying with her belly button ring as she falls deeper into (t)his spell. they kiss, and each kiss is a magical explosion of it's own.   someone said inseperable tonight.  she almost laughed. it scared the piss out of her.  so many pressures in her life right now. stress of venturing into an adult world and picking up responsibilities yet he eases that tension. someone she can actually study with, someone that makes her laugh a lot, someone she feels safe with.   the first person she's dated in a long long time.  the first person she's actually wanted around in a long long time.  too long she says.  where have you been all my life?

       urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink     well, apparently, blogger is deciding to be a bitch to me but hah! i'm still going to rant anyway..  today was fucking ass amazing! :)  i'm so crazy excited right now i don't even know where to bloody begin..it's just crazy how everything falls apart and gets mended again and you're watching all this beauty in your life so you sorta take a step back and go whhhooooaaa...  i was driving home from school today and i cross the bridge that separates bfn alabama and florida and it's raining but not pouring, just kinda drizzling flirting type of thing and there's a rainbow. i can't even remember the last time i saw a rainbow and it's fucking gorgeous. i want to stop the car and just sit there and be mesmerized by it and all the subconscious things it's telling me but damn. wow. i think it's scary because we had this conversation the other day about rainbows and promises and hope and all that stupid crazy shit you think about in your mind and so it was just breathtaking and thrilling all at the same time. :)  i got my biology paper back from class today too and i got a fucking 96. racheal does not do biology shit and racheal is fucking ecstatic. just like, fuck, that's my damn paper! it's like a i-can-actually-do-this type of thing and it's this indescribable happiness that just runs through you, just wow.  then as if god isn't being nice enough, we got let out of rehersals early today and the last run of the review we did for the blocking last night went perfect. like just fucking brilliant. it's that feeling where you've done something right and it's that other feeling of sharing that moment with someone and smiling and laughing because you're truly just buzzed and mad excited.   see, for the last few weeks it's just really been hectic and crazy with so much of pressure and work and school and trying to get my life sorted out and all that bullcrap you put your mind through you know? finding your place in the world and trying to act responsibly and 'right' and so i was extremely grateful for that extra two hours of just time. time to do nothing and anything i wanted. :)  so we went and got coffee till it closed and then went to go watch 'the transporter' and it's funny because we just bought tickets for whatever was showing next and had absolutely no bloody clue on what it was about and it's like chinese! azn pride and all that but i was fucking proud.   it's one of those nights where you are so buzzed you just laugh and laugh till it hurts and you want to dance and jump and sing all at the same time.   i've missed being spontaneous and living for the moment and doing what i feel like doing at that fucking moment and not really giving a rats ass at the same time.  like being free.  and finding out new things.  and discovering.  and learning.  and smiling. lots of smiling.   and having someone smile with you. laugh with you. dance, sing and shout with you.  that bond. connection. closeness.  just wow.  fooh.     urlLink "I sometimes wonder if I'm crazy. It's possible, isn't it? I mean, you don't really know how other people think. You can estimate, but you can't know for sure. Huh. "    p/s finished up ' urlLink about ' during break time but stupid me forgot to bring my network card so couldn't upload untill tonight but yeah, just four more to go!

       urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink      urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink     last night we took a drive to the beach and stayed a while to watch the sand shimmer after the waves have washed upon them. it was so beautiful; one of those things that stay in your mind forever like the first sunset you watched or something like that. fucking. amazing.   "there's nothing you can do about the past, because it's gone. and there's nothing you can do about the future, because it's not here yet. so live today and live in the Moment."   :)  pinecones are pretty damn spectacular too. i don't remember them from when i was little, not before malaysia. come to think of it, i don't even think malaysia has pine cone trees...do they?  the mid terms are this week, there is the pressure to study and do brilliantly..grr. days like these that are nice and cool make it spectacular for cookies, coffee and talk. there's a little bunch of us that get together after class that have sort of bonded, it is interesting how i've been here for three months exactly today but it feels so odd, almost deja vu like and eeriely familiar yet all at the same time so different. strange how time slips past by you as you impatiently wait on it.  ?  i have rehersals tonight..it is so tiring to live away from everything. sometimes i think all i really need in life is just to be content, or satisfied or something...be happy with who i am and what i am becoming and what i have achieved sort of thing which in a way i am, strangely enough.  our character excersizes today was a bunch of questions and it's weird.   part i - character structure   when i wake up in the morning...  i drag my lazy ass out of bed and take a shower   ever since i was a child...  i learnt that trust has to be earned   when i look in the mirror..  i don't know who i see   i can remember...  things that used to be important to me   the child in me...  laughs easily and does silly stupid things   i need...  balance   i hate..  being alone and thinking, sometimes.    strength to me means...  never giving up   weakness to me means...  breaking, crying, falling..that sorta shit   right now i am aware...  that i have responsibilities    sometimes i want to cry out to people...  because sometimes i think no one sees me at all   pain to me is...  destructive   i love..  hope. tranquility. peace of mind   if i could be free to do what i want to do...  i would be a pead emergency doctor   my body....   disgusts  is a part of me   if you could hear the music in me..  it would be unpredictable  ------   part ii - character emotion from inside out   the most beautiful part of my body is...  ?   happiness to me is...  being content    the thing i most want to do before i die is..  donate an organ   the most embarassed i ever was...  .......?   the ugliest part of my body is..  me?   the thing i like best about myself is..  the little things   pain to me is..  inevitable and teaching   the most secret thing about me is...  the person i am, the person i can be and the person i want to be   i can hear my father's voice speaking through my own when i tell myself...  trust has to be earned   love to me is...  not there   the thing i am most proud of is..  the kids   i want my epitaph to be..  gone home: exit upstage.  it's odd. just too much thinking on one page you know? i have to write a thesis on character submission and traits and it makes me think too much. scary.  hm..i am starving, and for some strange reason hot and spicy ramen noodles sound really good right now..  yum.  :P

       urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink      urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink     0 so i guess you're asking why and what the fuck and how and would you please make up your fucking mind you indecisive cow :) the truth is, i don't have the answers. i don't know why i'm back and i don't exactly know why i want to do this again...  maybe it has to do with the long talk we had last night about forgotten dreams and things that made you passionate, maybe i missed the a place to come, maybe i just missed writing and talking to no one and everyone at the same time, maybe i just missed this and everything it meant to me...maybe my way of trying again is ending the things i didn't succeed to the last time. grab the bulls balls eh?  yet so much has happened all at once. i am eighteen, legal. an adult. so many changes has come about within and around me yet essentially, painfully, i realize that i am still very much the same person.   my heart still gets broken once in a while, a lot of the times because i have blindly led myself to that door but it's okay because i want to learn from this shit, i want to hurt so badly now if it means that i'll be fanfuckingtastic later...if that makes any sense at all anyway.  i am not perfect.   it hurts to say this but i am not who i wanted to be. i failed at dreams i tried to build, and while i'm falling into this abyss and drowning myself in a void of emptiness and fury i realize i am tired and that i can't go on anymore. i tried and tried again, made the same mistakes, drew back to the same conclusions. sometimes some things don't work out and you can beat it to death but some questions just don't have answers right?  content.  i have an amazing life. i have amazing friends and people that care and love me. i am making the grades and doing the things i want to do, fulfilling the little dreams and things do work out.  so i still don't know why i'm back, because i'm habitual i guess. i am a stubborn selfish bitch and this is my place, my home. my corner on this side of the world and i'm just me.   this is my voice.  my side.  leave if you don't like it but i have to accept me.  i'm trying.

       four years.   i don't feel liberated, if anything, i feel worst. like i've handed my parents a collection of shit on a silver platter.  but i'm better now. no more nights, no more crazy extremes, not much throwing up.   ...but still sick.  still small, stupid, still need help.  and a part of me is thankful that i stepped out and asked for help.  but a part of me questions the consequences.  changes. strip everything and rock the comfortable and work at it even if means tearing it apart to start again?  scary.  is this the part i say, " hie, my name is racheal and i'm bullimic "?  i guess so then.

       happy turkey day.  it's thanksgiving. it's 9:58 in the morning, it's wet, cold and noisy outside. but in here, in here it's a different world. in here it has lasted forever and i'm down to my sweats, picking at my fingers, wanting to throw up and needing a ciggarette. in here i am wasted and crying. maybe for god to save me, maybe for me to save me. maybe for just any damn thign to save me.  he says i've fucked up.  i know i've fucked up damnit. i know. i know. i know.  i know it when i wake up in the morning. i know it when i'm fixing dinner and the stupid osbournes soothes me in the background. i know it when i curl up and sleep at night. i know it every moment. i know i've fucked up.  ten thousand dollars in three months. he says i can't afford to feed your addiction. i can't do this to myself and it's wrong and i need help. that i need to change. and he tells me it's about disciplie and willpower and some fucking common sense.  he wants to know if i have anything to say to him.   i shake my head but forty eight hundred miles away where it is dark over there and a single solitary phone line connects us he doesn't see me.  he wants to know how and why and what.  i don't know, daddy, i just fucked up.  and that's not an excuse and i wish i could tell you what the fuck was wrong with me.  he tells me i'm intelligent and that i'm talented but that i can't do this to myself.  he tells me he knows i've changed and he knows i am changing.  and i want to say did i have a choice?  and i want to say was it really up to me?  but i stop myself. but i stop because i don't know how to tell him. i don't know how to explain this in between where i am confident and secure with myself yet these very things somehow push me further too. and i hide, i cover, i inexplicably deal with it and they put up with my nonsense.  they put up with my nonsense because they love me. because more than anything in the whole wide world they want to see their little spoilt princess happy.  but there is a fine line.  and i don't want to be her anymore.  he says he'll bring me home if it continues. like it's a threat. like it's bad or something.  i like it here, i do. it's nice, and comfortable and like home somewhat...but it's not home at all. it's so different. so fucking different and strange and i feel so stupid and colored and dumb. like there's nothing i really know for a fact here. and i like the starting fresh and the building bridges again, and i like the quiet of suburban lilfe and new experiences but it just gets difficult i guess. i'm dumb.  it's been three months and i should be used to it now. i have a great boyfriend, excellent grades, a thriving career and amazing friends. why am i complaining? i shouldn't because i've came so far from nothing to something. because i'm thinking about the homeless man outside and i should count my blessings.  because last night i looked beside me and sitting next to me were two people that loved me very much and at home were my "parents" and a million miles away, i had people that prayed for me each night and loved me with their whole hearts good or bad.   but i let those people down and it hurt.  and then the pastor asks us what we're grateful for this year. and amanda breaks down beside me because her dad's left home and she's turned her plane around from virginia because her mom rings her broken down, crying because she doesn't want to spend thanksgiving alone. and she says, i'm thankful for family and friends.   and i look beside me and here is a man that's willing to love me for all my flaws. and here at home in a different country is another set of parents letting me in again and here is god saying, what the fuck are you complaining for?  it's thanksgiving.  and frankly, it's time for some changes.  a new beginning.  it's time to leave the past behind and start again.

       reach out, tonight; my home is yours.    a little early but oh well...  burning firewood in amber flames of orange glows as the turkey roasts and all of today comes to rest tonight. i thank god for gifts so sweet and bitter, for learning experieces as little memories jingle in my mind and lonely tired weary eyes cry for the very last time. safe in someone's arms again, secure, life today seems beautiful and challenging.  for family; all nights and days of torture and torment having to be bloody related to me. for people to listen to me and laugh when the day is over, for when days melt into dark empty cold nights and everything is uncertain, for at the end, standing right behind me are the people that have known me my whole life. are the people that will always know me the best no matter how far i run or how much i hide. thank you for loving me, for caring, for showing love in your own special ways and meeting all my needs.   for friends; both near and far. for terrible nights i have hated this place, thank you for friends at home that have pushed me forward again and again, for friends here that have made this whole experience a better one, for helping me fit in and slowly taking the time to explain moronic things that everyone around here should know. for sharing a part of their culture and making it so much easier. for being with me to discover new everyday things. there are friends and there are  friends . thank you for being my "friends".  this year, there are no long overwhelming emotional schizo speeches. i am grateful to be alive, i am grateful for healing and little miracles. this year has been a combination of good and bad events. whatever doesn't break you makes you stronger.....for not breaking.  an online community that has become home for a while now. thank you for space, for words of wisdom and for inspiration and encouragement to be whoever i want to be.   outside, on the cold empty streets lies an old homeless man that begs for shelter. hungry pangs invade his shrinking bony frame...what is his story? how can i help? what can i do?  tonight, my home is your home. my coat yours. my meal is never too little to be shared, never too big to be small.  reach out.  bring in.  i'm only one in a world of billions.  thank you, everyone, anyone.

       let down.  it's thanksgiving tommorow. a part of me has a multitude of things to be grateful for, things to shout about, things that have completed my life yet this week has been awful. wretched. this week i have felt invisible and nothing, yelled at and beaten to bits and pieces. i just got off the phone with my dad, another conversation, another telephone call.  and he questions my priorities. and he questions the person i am.   "think about what's really important to you"  "you fucked up." plays about six hundred and seventy two times in my mind.  i let my father down. i let the people i don't mean to let down everytime. dissappointed again. racheal fucked up…now just how many times have i heard that? have i said that? it’s not even a valid excuse anymore.  a part of me is trying to move on. a part of me that's confident is weary at the same time too. i am not depressed or having a string of bad days, i am dissapointed. maybe because i know i could be so much more. maybe because i know i let myself down on purpose.  i want to go home. as much as there are so many good things here, i want to go home.  i thought maybe i'd get to go home for christmas break.  i thought maybe someone would say, you know what, screw everything else, want to go home?  because i miss my mom and dad. i miss grandpa and grandma and talking to them. i miss playing with the kids and watching their faces light up. i miss my cousins and my relatives, their screams and shouts. i miss my friends.  i am home sick and it’s terrible.  but i like it here. i swear i really do. i came for the wrong reasons but i'm slowly beginning to change, it gets hard sometimes. it gets confusing and lonely and frustrating. when things don't go your way and when no one understands you. literally.  he said if you go home i don't suppose we'd work out huh?  i don't know.  i know i like you. and i know you make me want to laugh and cry at the same time because i feel so amazing and special at the same time. i know i like it when i find your arms around me at night, when i see your smiling face at the end of the line. i know all these things and a part of me has felt like this before yet it is different. hard to explain. do i love you?  is this what love feels like?  i don't know.  do i want to stay?  i don't know.  i know a part of me has to. i know a part of me doesn't have a choice.   i am grateful. but why do i feel so lost at the same time?  i am tired of my past. i am tired of what has happened and i am tired of dealing with things. i just want everybody to forget it and let me try again. i know i fucked up and i'm sorry and i know i've fucked up a lot of other things to but when the whole wide world constricts you and reminds you constantly that you're a failure it gets to a point where it's really hard to keep on going. i know i am headed at the right path but you have to stop bringing me down damnit.  i don't know what to tell my father  i tried "i just fucked up."  but he just questioned more. and yelled more. and stamped it in more.  i don't know how to tell him, i don't know. maybe i'm dumb. maybe i'm stupid. maybe i'm not good enough to be your daughter. maybe you should just give me away.  again.

       emo.  i'd be empathetic, but that'll only mean i have to open up further, or care, or risk falling into places i've known before. a full circle? fuck that. this is exactly the same as it was before only now the tables have turned. you talk about empowerment, does it make me any stronger? any more elevated? maybe...or not.   does it make me feel good to see someone i love hurt, no, it never does. as much as i bitch about it and as much as you've hurt me, i'll never wish it on anybody, no, not even you. especially not you.  i still care, but some part of me can only care so much before i get hurt again.  am i happy? yes, yes i am. and i deserve to be. i haven't been in so long and i know i've come so far. am i proud of myself? yes. for once in my whole entire goddamn life and i can solidly stand here and say, i am enough.  relish all the nights i came back to you and grovelled and cajoled and pleaded. relish all the nights i lay on my empty bed, with my cut up soul, and the dead tone at the other end of the line that tells me you're not here anymore. take away all that pain and all the nights and days i've woke up crying, it's made me stronger but no, i would not like to ever remember that again. no, not your cold steely voice at the other end, no, not that click, no, not another email, no, not all the times you've put me down and grinded me into pulp, no.  never again the times i've waited for you to come but you never did.   if i was stronger i would tell you fuck that and lets try again. but so many parts of me on so many levels wants never to do this ever again, you don't go back running to the stove once you're burnt and trust me on that one, i'm fucking burnt. charred. ashes to dust and all that. a part of me is dead, a part of me is shut off, closed up, ripped apart and it feels good. it feels good to not go through so much pain, it feels good to disconnect, it feels good to move on and let go and not be so vulnerable and fragile.   it feels good to finally have control of my life again.  and yes, it feels good to have someone next to me again. you fall and fall and fall and you try to look for something to hang on to and your strong person and your big guy, the one that promises to be there forever and the one that promises he'll love you forever, then you watch as he pushes you away, then you watch as he screams at you, then you watch as he tells you it wasn't love, then you watch as he tells you he didn't know what the fuck it was.   then you feel that emptiness. then you feel that ugliness. then you feel that dirtiness.   that i am nothing, and disgusting and all my fears.  then you listen to him confirm that.  once.  twice.  three times.  ....i lost count.   then you don't invite it because hell, you've never invited it. and it just comes, right when you don't expect it, it comes. and so does healing. and so does understanding. it comes and it scares the piss out of you but this time you've learnt your lesson and you say none of that self doubting shit and none of that 'fucked up little child' business. you work at it and you work at it again and you work at it even if it means you have to reopen certain scars so they bleed just right and heal properly because there's only so long you can blame it on someone else and only so long you can feel sorry for yourself and only so long you can lock yourself up in a tiny dark empty cell that lies in the recesses of your brain.  there's only so long your prejudices can shut out love.  and you finally realize and know, it's okay.  it's finally goddamn okay.    urlLink  "maybe the mistake was assuming that love solves everything. that it takes everything away, makes everything else not matter anymore. "

       urlLink    urlLink    urlLink     i am thinking about changing my major. i've been having second thoughts about journalism for a while now and after having my papers torn apart consistently for about twelve weeks, i am thinking that i might not be cut out for this writing thing at all.  right now, i am taking biology, biology lab, english 1101, creative writing, acting i, public speaking(shit class), rehersal and performance and am making pretty good grades in all of them. i enjoy school, for the most part, and the big nerdy part of me actually finds all this hogwash interesting BUT i'm not so sure if i like this whole writing deal anymore.  originally, i was enrolled to do broadcast journalism but i need to take all these basic journalism courses first and damnit, racheal hates history, geography and any other shit of that kind. half the requirements and prerequisites take up about all those damn subjects. pah.  i've been offered a scholarship to be in the jazz choir next term but i am really looking forward to being in the drama department again. i've always been interested and involved in the 'entertainment' and 'artsy-fartsy' side of things that to think about a real actual job and covering shit like the elections is exciting but it doesn't really make my heart pump you know?  bob wants to know if i'd like to work on the set again for the next show and that makes me excited. :) i think i am somewhat creative more than i am intellectual. sure, i'll sit around and talk to you about seven hundred and forty two real things but give me a paintbrush or a script and i'm there in a heartbeat you know?  or maybe i just don't have much going on up there.  whatever.  well anyway, as i was saying, i have to start registering for the spring term. mr cashwell has listed me in for english 1102, algebra, mass communication, earth science, classic mythology, acting ii and/or jazz ensemble. all my credits should be transferable within the state but i sorta need to be certain about my major and i really don't want to do a general thing.  so how?  i can't go into theater because to be quite honest, there's nothing to fall back into. and the whole point of me getting a degree would be so i had a degree and when i went to go do my shit and get burnt out again and all that fun stuff then i'd still be able to do journalism or some shit right? wrong.  maybe i should do marketing?  public relations?  god knows i work them prostitutes well.  what i'd really like to do is join the air force and be a flying paramedic or an emergency peadaetrician...but seeing as i can't even spell it, maybve not.  speaking in which, kirk got called for active duty. he's leaving for the turkey border in march, i don't know about you but i'm sick of all this war and iraq nonsense.   pah.  p/s sudafed bad. :P

      lol, i just had a weird moment?  hm..franklin and i have one class together. creative writing. and in that class, it's like a bitch fest. you basically take everyone's work and tear it apart and feed it to the dogs and bitchslap each other left, right and center.  martha is also in this class.  martha is my administrative coordinator. see, people that work on campus are allowed to take classes there as well. so it's very strange to have someone like your teacher come down to your level in class and have to critique their shit.   well anyway, martha calls.  it is very scary when martha calls because as nice and wonderful as a person she is, she has also the power to deport me back to malaysia. very very scary.  hell no am i leaving bloody fuck nowhere pensacola now.  but anyway, she wants to know if i'll swing by her office on monday.  i don't know bout you but a million red bulbs are ringing off in my head.  holy fuck what have i done now?  but she says she'd like to work with me on my latest assignment because apparently it is good.  i want to laugh.  because in that class i have been reduced to tears definitely more than once without anyone knowing. except the obvious of course but that's an entire different story completely.  my stories are shit. i am not a writer. i don't write well. i suck at english. and my grammar can go kiss my big fat hairy yellow behind.  so that was a nice interesting phonecall.  and now i'm all weirded out.  remind me again to tell you about this class, boy are there some fucking interesting stories to tell about that damn stupid moronic dumb class.  people are weird.  very weird.  oh wait, shit, i'm in that class.

         i just spent the last forty-five minutes laughing my ass off. oh yes, today is shaping up to be a nice one...:P  i accidently stumbled in, just running through some links and "whooaaa", besides, it was way way too tempting to not go in but yeah, it was interesting. last week though, last week, i would have been all emotional and shit but right now i'm 'pahhh'...hehe...which is funny. because he is actually quite an amusing and interesting guy but hey, fucked that up! so yeah..  back to this world:  things are surreal-ly comfortable it's weird. not even like an oh shit, i'm pissed ass scared comfortable but just a 'comfortable', peroid.   it's cute.   :P  i found roses all over my bed the other night with sushi and a midnight walk down the bay with a jazz cd. now, if that doesn't make you want to hug the universe and thank all my lucky stars then wonderful intellectual sweet conversation will. and i'm the lucky girl!   whoop. whoop.  didn't do much today, worked on the duets for acting and did some stupid grammar test for english and am now waiting to be picked up so i can crawl into bed and sleep forever. i'm pretty much tylenol happy right now so it's all good.    life is Good......! hell bloody fuck yeah!

         wording out differences, things that make me upset. wording out feelings onto paper, onto screen. this is my exit; the pedestal that i can stand on and proclaim i am free, i am free. shouting raving lunatic, shut up you stupid indecent moronic bitch, this is my place, my world, my corner away from the world.  i wonder if anyone sees me as i unmask and unlayer, make up scrubbed away, digging into raw flesh, i bleed to show you my inner self, to reveal the broken pieces in me and the torn up soul i beat from. love me for who i am i say, leave if it digusts you. dishonesty is a fucked up moronic feeling, dishonesty is a horrid horrid hurtful lie. do not pretend. do not lie. do not hurt.  you are what you write.  i write and rant and go on seven hundred and fifty two times about him and him and him. i cry because it hurts, i laugh because i'm happy.  a year yesterday i met him, today this year i loved him. the two he's, play them together in a quintet and a quartet and string the harmonies together to see the racket that will come out. he tells me to move on and fuck off, i ask him questions that bleed on solid cut off walls that intrude, he leaves again.  but i don't care anymore. i cannot care. i don't want to care.  i attempt to fix and let go, welcoming changes and letting wonderful exciting things to happen to me.  this harmony, happiness, euphoria seems vaguely eeriely familiar. almost dejavu. do all evil men drive trucks, come from california and have a good sense of humor?  i don't know, i'm about to find out. invest everything in this? hell no. run? absolutely not. try again? say what? then what the fuck are you going to do then?  i don't know.  but i'm trying. and investing. and running.   oh wait, that's just me.  dumb moronic fat bitch.   i am happy, but one part of me wants to question 'how long'?  i am happy, and one part of me says, fuck everything else; i'm happy!!!!!! fanfuckingasstastic!@!   but it's a good day. a quiet day. it's a strange day.  one year.  time creeps up on you doesn't it?  boo.   urlLink  "Some days you feel like you are talking to a wall.

      listen. smile. trust. love.  strong word; funny things that evoke weird things that offset my heart. sparks and chemistry that seem so right and magical scares me. wanting to curl up to you and watch tv forever and play footsie, wanting to have your hand in mine, and wanting you to hold me tighter and tighter and never let go.  giggling and laughing and smiling and feeling so happy it's stupid.  i laugh because you say all the things i want to say and mean it. i laugh because there are tokens of what you mean to me all around my room, roses on every inch for separate occasions but everything remains superficial to the other gifts you present me.   you help me believe in things i have forgotten to dream about and make me want to do better, come out stronger and fight. you make me patient and trusting, learning to understand that not everything is always my way and that sometimes, deep inside, i am a someone and that someone is worth it.  you push me forward but pressure me in right ways. taking care of me as you say, i want to say i'm fragile and watch out because i break and i want to say so many things, things i think about late at night when the world is sleeping and i am worried but then i look into your eyes and feel your body next to mine and the thoughts go away and the hurt slowly fades away.  healing me.  i'd like to think i'm terribly courageous in this step but it actually feels kinda nice and good. right.  i don't know what grows on what. if love is love or how friendship blossomed but i know that tonight, i'm just happy i have you.  thank you.

        hmm..word play comes to my mind but a million beats to every sentence kinda makes it hard. it has been Amazing.  :)  i hesistate to take down the previous post because every time i come in and look at it, it makes me giggle. :p  we had a sold-out opening night and pretty much the whole weekend! hehe, it's just crazy and funny at the same time i guess, frustrating also because guess who couldn't get tickets?!?  haha, nevermind the fact that he took time off work but hah! lol, he's been making up for it though so it's all good.   hid band had a show on friday night too and i think it's kinda cute how we both had good crowds so we were both on this unexplainable typa buzz like the world is so fucking great thing.   damn, i like this guy.  SHIT!  hehe, i take back all i say about men being generally evil because they're not. and i'm just stupid. and retarded.  but it's all good because it's just kinda nice being just me and not being the insecure fuck head i tend to be so it's a really nice experience and ahhhhhhhhhhhh. :P  weeee!  there are a lot of things that seem to hold me back from this but you know how some things just feel 'right'?  it's as if i am sitting here and for once in my whole bloody life i can tell you honestly that i am not worrying it to death, not because there isn't a point but because there's something about being together and that feeling; i don't know if it's love, and i don't know if it's forever, but i know safe. and this feels safe. warm. secure.   very nice.  about time damnit.   :P

       sleep?  we played pool tonight..it was funny. six games to one, oops. oh well, at least i played eh?  i'm getting kinda droopy and falling asleep but  rehersals went...okay i guess? stan didn't give us notes because of last night's event so we only get them tommorow.   so many things to say but not really sure where to begin much less if it should even be talked about at all.  hm..i'm tired.  goodnight.

       things happen if you try..     hmm..i just woke up.   i strongly, do not at all, recommend running on an hour and a half of sleep a day.  rehersals came out fucktastically late last night because of the run through with the orchestra, we're doing costumes tonight then adding make up tommorow and hopefully, the show should kick ass by friday.  i have to say though, it's been really nice to have him around during breaks; sanity prevailing and comforting so it's good. i guess? :P  we're trying to keep it open, fun and getting to know each other right now, sometimes, when we're walking there's this strange feeling that makes me feel like i've known him forever but it's interesting.  bill came to one of our rehersal's one night and brought me a sweater i apparently left in his place...nevermind the fact that he's from uwf and won't stop ringing..stalker alert? uhuh.   it's always nice to watch the guys get it on and turn on a notch, sorta silly though but the semi confrontation was fun. at least on my part anyway.  private number good.   :P  over the last week i think i've pretty much managed to wrap my past in a little ribbon and tie and packaged it neatly into the corner. it did sorta hurt and make me cry a little, (okay, maybe a lot) but it's all good because i think i've walked away from this a better person, stronger.  friendship runs it's test and sometimes you win, sometimes you lose eh?  kick me hard if i start feeling sorry for myself again, i can get kinda wrapped around my fat arse sometimes.  well anyway, i need to go take a shower and put on some warmer clothes...note to winter: kiss my yellow behind.  :P   p/s the server is expected to continue having pms throughout the week or so...so, uhm, have fun? sorry!   urlLink "in short; i think i've largely got my head around the evolving idiosyncracies of the medium. sometimes i still get burnt. i definitely get the balance wrong sometimes. but i tread the line as best i can."

      beware of the fat self-obsessed needy bitch.     so it's been an interesting night..   lol, i started this post two nights ago and consequently fell asleep midway through a conversation, thinking out this post and d/l the pictures from the camera. someone say exhausted? i think so too.  :) it's just been one of those weeks where your days and nights all string together and you're kinda like 'what?' but it's been fun. i mean, sure, i'd like some alone time and time to do nothing but i've realized how disgustingly unproductive and depressing that gets to racheal so i pick this i don't have a life outside of all this shit type of thing anyday.  besides, learn to be grateful for the moments eh?  life is really strange right now..but a good type of strange you know? i'm fucking excited about the musical and i'm at this stage where things are comfortable and i have my routines that make me feel safe and normal and all that so it's kinda nice.   school is coming along pretty well and it's hard to believe that there's only five more weeks to the end of this term. i feel like i've come so far since before so there's this surreal magical type of aura that surrounds it. one year ago today i was preparing to leave for nz and i can still remember all the feelings that came with it...i'm thinking back to how that feels so damn long ago it's crazy.  you know, there are a lot of things in my past that i wish didn't happen and a lot of regrets that i wish i could somehow mend or change, but the other night when i was trying to figure things out there was a tinge of realization that everything happens for a reason.   perhaps this happy with life racheal doesn't last very long, perhaps the good spells come and go and perhaps i might come back tonight again and be crying and upset with myself and hate the world. but perhaps so many other things might happen too. perhaps i might get hit by a car, or perhaps between now and tommorow six hundred things might have changed, don't live for the perhaps and live for the right nows right?  the easiest route is to just give in and give up.  the strongest is to heal.  so i don't really understand half of what's going around me sometimes..but it's okay, because nobody does anyway.   :P     "I asked God to take away my pain. God said, No. It is not for Me to take away, but for you to give it up.  I asked God to make my handicapped child whole. God said, No. His spirit is whole, his body is only temporary.  I asked God to grant me patience. God said, No. Patience is a by-product of tribulations; it isn't granted, it is earned.  I asked God to give me happiness. God said, No. I give you blessings, happiness is up to you.  I asked God to spare me pain. God said, No. Suffering draws you apart from worldly cares and brings you closer to Me.  I asked God to make my spirit grow. God said, No. You must grow on your own, but I will prune you to make you fruitful.  I asked for all things that I might enjoy life. God said, No. I will give you life so that you may enjoy all things.  I asked God to help me love others as much as He loves me. God said... Ahhh, finally!  you have the idea."      urlLink "Basically, the bottom line is this: I am me. This blog is me. There is no variation between the two.

      i'd like to believe the world was smaller....i really do.   then maybe we'd be connected stronger, understood deeper, thoughts decipher. i'd get you, and you'd get me. i'll fill you, and you'll fill me. i'd fix you, and you'd fix me. and there would me one soul mate for every one soul, and one lover for every heartache, and an extra smile for every tear. maybe, if, perhaps.   it was dark, grossly warm, stumbling to take a shower, half open, half asleep eyes that slip into the outfit put together the night before. hastily tying and untying, smudging lipstick and dragging a black knapsack with odds and ends sticking out. distinct familiarity, the hushed forced sounds of dawn, slipping away into darkness, a drowning feeling of running away. driving off into nowhere.  birds not even up yet, eyes are tired. tired because it's sleep just slightly too deep than a refreshing 15 minute doze and sleep not deep enough to be determined sleep.  cried the night before. made decisions today. after christmas. new year. i'll fix my life. i'll make new resolutions. i'll be alright.   exit ramp onto the freeway. eighty miles an hour. wind in her face, hands on the wheel, music. the damn fucking music; drown out the voices.  exit onto life.  exit into freedom.  exit into escape.

      laughing because she doesn't want to scream, smiling because she doesn't want to feel, numbing because she doesn't want to cry. and no one sees her.   and no one hears her.   she's quiet. neatly hidden.   tipsy on the wine. white, transparent liquid that splashes on carpet. falls but the glass doesn't shatter. no smithereens to collect tonight, just mere sour stench of pulped grapes and damp odor.   for a moment she is lost. transported. remembers.  remembers picking up remnants of their glases broken on the marbled slippery floor, and how the red spread so fast and flowed so fluidly. it was art in creation and drama in explosion.  tension.  she was going out tonight. been asked. begged.   her last night in town. her new found status of being single, exploiting that freedom. she was happy, she was renewing, she was trying again.  drastically improving. piecing together little pieces to form the bigger picture..she'd be okay, she'd be alright.  she was secure.  only that getting ready she stared too hard at the being in the mirror. she found the flaws again, she found discrepancies and ickiness.   holds that small torn notebook lined paper. numbers hastily scratched on to it.   tired of feeling like this. tired of trying trying again. tired of excuses and lies and bullshit.  just call the number.  just ask for help.   fix yourself and do one solitary right thing.  going insane. so many questions. too many answers. nervous breakdown reaching it's climax.   i just want to be okay, i just want to be fine.  479-9411.  i want to. i know i need to. i have to but something stops me. something scares me. something about coming out in the open and saying i have a problem messes me up. something about fixing this then fucking up and having nothing else to blame but me. something about being afraid to realize that i might not be strong enough for the consequences, the truth. that i might not stand alone secure.  and i'm lost.  confused.  and i'm small.   big.   tiny.   fat.  and i'm tired.  alone.  hiding.  where's my season of hope?

      just three decibels too low, deep...soothing. an angel's decree from heaven, let there be light, let there be peace. sleep tight now my child, sleep tight.  it'll all be over soon. it's just a bad dream, just a bad night, just strange situations and not enough inside to fight. just intoxicated and looping.  fallen streams of salty teardrops caress fleshy cheeks, lose twenty pounds she tells herself. criticizing, analysing, destroying.   she has so many fears. too many fears. why does she feel so schizopherenic? so manic depressive? the extremes, the pretending, the violent extremities....laughing because she doesn't want to scream, smiling because she doesn't want to feel, numbing because she doesn't want to cry. and no one sees her.  and no one hears her.  she's quiet. neatly hidden.  drip. drip. drip.  crimson blood flows, hurting herself, tearing apart flesh and wound, differentiating, or at least attempting to. which is physical and which is mental? torture. abuse. punish yourself you sorry excuse for a human.  packs her bag. not going home. going away but not going home. alone. alone. alone.  christmas presents. more christmas shopping. tidy bows and colored tissue. tis the season to be merry. forgiveness. forgive yourself.  dream. let be. fantasize. carpe diem.  she knows who she is yet large overwhelming questions cloud her mind. searching for herself. searching for bits and pieces to string together. looking for the bigger picture, putting the puzzle together. clearer now, clearer. haunt me, don't distract me. pull me, don't annoy me. try me, don't abuse me.   tipsy on the wine. white, transparent liquid that splashes on carpet. falls but the glass doesn't shatter. no smithereens to collect tonight, just mere sour stench of pulped grapes and damp odor.   for a moment she is lost. transported. remembers.  remembers picking up remnants of their glases broken on the marbled slippery floor, and how the red spread so fast and flowed so fluidly. it was art in creation and drama in explosion.  tension.  but she puts on the happy face for them to see. she always has a face for anyone. the you can't touch me looks, brushes away the sweltering harassing remarks from far too overgrown men, the kind she attracts all the time anyway. fat. old. rich. balding. men.   and the ones that are worth it she pushes away. shies away at even the slightest chance, flirtation, banter. she's single again, they chase, she runs. further and further away it's not even a game anymore.   it's some sick deprevation in her mind.  it's some solitudal need to be independent crap she's drilled into her mind  yet she wants to love. she wants to be loved. but it comes out foreign and weak. she's not used to being so open, she's not used to expression, she's not used to love.  what is love?  the bolder stronger renewed side of her wants to find out. accepts the offer.   she is dressed. preparing for a good night out, the last in town. preparing for lots of dancing and swearing. for waffle house at three and too many ciggarettes, too many drinks. yet getting ready though, getting ready slowly disturbs her. and she doesn't feel like it anymore. and she looks, and stares. she sees ugliness, she sees pain, she sees the things she cannot hide.  she needs to lose weight. she needs to escape. she needs the answers.  she needs help.  479-9411

      ahh..there's absolutely nothing like driving, shopping, and queue lines the weekend before christmas.   kinda makes you jealous of me doesn't it?  cause i get to sit around in traffic in seventy eight degree weather (yea, you go figure, thirty for a week then it's in the seventies), listening to the harmonious sounds of honking traffic and broad daylight finger excersizes while carefully analyzing the shitty sorry excuse for christmas music the little town of three actual listenable stations play while ever so gently realizing the itch and sudden urge to pee.  yes, yes, there's just absolutely nothing like christmas.  oh and btw, would someone please tell santa i'd like world peace for christmas?  thank you.  :)

      Maybe it was because I read what he had to say about us. And I felt that shitty icky crap that always seem to come hand in hand with it and realized, rather pathetically, how different I’d become yet at the same time, how emotionally sort of strange I still was in a way.   There’s always going to be something weird and strange about jared and I, perhaps even some sort of cosmic fatal attraction type of drama but something about Saturday night made me realize that as soon as I said the words, “maybe” I fucking ran. I ran and screamed and yelled and realized I couldn’t and didn’t love him in that way anymore. Perhaps a cling to desperation and wanting to soothe healing wounds. You know how when a wound heals it itches and the battle is not to scratch it? Exactly.  A short, somewhat short anyway, recap of the last few weeks is complicating and weird.  I am single. And I can honestly actually tell you, I’m okay with that.   Somehow, it wasn’t that franklin invaded my privacy but rather the attachment of having someone so close while not really having it all together really bothered me. It wasn’t that I didn’t have fun, or that I did not feel comfortable with him or trust him but rather a this-is-cute-but-really-what-and-who-are-we-kidding type of thing.   In a bid to escape everything that seemed to close in and constrict me closer and closer, I drove out to Mobile on Saturday for a concert. I am pseudo and at times fanatically religious. I may not practice a lot of the teachings and my faith may get broken once in a while but I believe there is an immense eternal being out there and all that good shit. It was uplifting and at the same time terribly eye opening, I wasn’t sure if it was just because the person we had gone to watch was the same artist that I saw in Malaysia or if it was just the being able to step away from all this shit and think thoroughly thing. Well anyway, four hours of driving and being in some place else and thinking clearly for once in a long while was good apparently.  I came home, physically whacked but mentally fresher than I’d been in a while. he drove over needing to say the things he had to say and so we talked. And I explained. And somehow laughter, smiles and a big great hug emerged out of it. Minus a pillow fight, lots of tickling, and midway distraction of course.  But anyway, it was weird because everything was out in the open rather that understated subtle shit that had to be read in between the lines and it felt really good. I watched his truck pull away and it wasn’t like the other night where I had told him I had needed some time alone but it was rather quite drastically different.  Then I went in to ring jared. Yeah, I know. smart, racheal, really smart. Doh.  I rang perhaps not realizing all the things I had told myself before. Lost in some moment I suppose, that desperation I clearly remembered and talked my ass of for a good few minutes into oblivion and it ended. Somehow, having said everything and opening the door had brought in closure.  I cried and sobbed and did the whole she bang. Feeling sorry for myself because I couldn’t go home for Christmas and just letting go. And it felt good. Hell, it felt really really good.   Marc shot me yesterday and I somewhat enjoyed it. It was weird and different, yet it was pleasing in some odd sense. I fucking aced the biology paper which seems so ironic when it was to be one of my most difficult subjects and it’s nice how this term has wrapped up and ended.  I think I made some pretty good grades and there are a lot of little side projects I have going for me and being planned that it’s nice to look forward to.  Tomorrow I leave for a long awaited vacation to Orlando and Melbourne, which is I guess rather coincidentally planned to fit quite nicely into my frame of mind.  So nothing has turned out like it was supposed to and nothing ever will you know?  Just go with the flow I guess  Strangeness, but I actually think I’m happy.  Madness.

      [12/17/2002 9:40:16 PM | + racheal] shagging. I feel sick.   I want to go throw up and throw up and throw up.   I don’t know what it is…remnants of dinner flushed down with red wine and biscotti feels trapped in my throat. But that’s the way it always feel, that’s the way the story goes. Right before I do myself the glorious perverse pleasure of pumping the volume up to stick my fingers down my throat and drown out the gagging. To drown out the sounds of making myself sick, simultaneous relief and disgust at the same time. I’m making myself sick.   I’m late. I’ve never kept track, never worried about it. I’m not a sleeper, hard to believe but I don’t exactly fuck around. No, it doesn’t mean that I’ve never had sex, it just means that the meaning of a casual fuck has never quite rang anything to me, make love though…make love I have. Only that it’s different, I’ve never had to worry about the actual conceivement of an unwanted child.   I’m late. And it scares the piss out of me. I’m stressed and I’ve half blown smoke up my ass convincing myself that stressing it out, being underweight, and having a shit system for a body contributes to it. Abortion. Fucking A.   I’m not pregnant. I’m not pregnant. I’m not fucking damn pregnant.   I just cannot have that much of amazing luck. To an extent, I think we have been very safe, yet there are still questions. Loopholes. Condom? Check. Spermicidal? Check. Birth control pills? Not checked. Heck, the last thing on earth I expected when I came here was to have a relationship much less sleep with someone so why would I have brought my prescription right? Wrong. I’m a dumbass.   I had one of those piss on a little shit piece of foam and let it tell you if it detects hormones or not tests but it came out negative. Those three minutes were my three  minutes in hell. And I’m still late.   Why beat yourself over such a simple matter right you drama queen bitch.   For one, it’s not simple. In fact, it’s about as complicating complex as it can get.   Add in an ex-girlfriend, an ex-boyfriend, lots of shagging, and the whole thing about wanting to just be friends into it and you get a turmoil of bullshit and drama.   Only that I’m the major one freaking out.   Why?   Because as always, I’m the only fucking person that knows.   Hell, I could always just ring Her up and tell her right.   Or Him.   Or the Ex.   Whatever really.   Oh don’t mind me. I’m just the crazy insane bitch freaking out as usual.

      sanity prevails every once so often....i have a shoot today, somehow, that brings back distant memories which i am unsure if it would be better left forgotten.  we're going to fort pickens by the beach. i have three costume changes, two looks, one set. marc is photographing. salty air, breeze and finally, some warm sunshine. my only requests have been roses and fruit. maybe even alcohol. but then i've been there before, boozed up on yet another bottle of chardonnay, puffing on another pack of ciggarettes, bitching at another placid flaw of the human system.  i have pretty nails today. a nice new black leather coat, dyed jet black hair (failed attempt of red streaks) and a cute ass skirt. i aced my biology exam today, the finals, the last one i'll ever have to take and breaths of relief choke me. yes, i am that pleased. i walk down the hallways and guys whooop but my new shirt says, 'i want attention...but not from boys'.   apparently, i am gay now.  rainbow, fruity, happy vixen.  or maybe i'm bisexual.  whatever really. label me whatever you want, however you please.   is this position good for you?

      i don't know why it stopped. or how it ended. or why we became what we became.   i wish i did though, i really wish we tried again. i wish we got ourselvews together in time to save us. but last night you left, last night you hurt me again like countless other times before, and i don't wonder if my disconnection this time will really last at all because maybe i'm just tired of thinking.  maybe i'm just tired.  i'm really tired and sometimes i really wish god will just stop and let me off this world a while. sometimes it's hard and there's so much damn pressure.   i don't exactly know how i feel about me right now. i feel ugly.  i am disgusted.  disgusting.  revolfuckingting.  small. i feel really small. and insignificant. and stupid. and everything you said frokm before.  i feel pointless.  am i pointless?

      It always seems easier to refer to yourself in third person. Somehow, it seems more distant, less painful, not so real. Maybe?  So they talk today. They talk and somehow she finds herself crying and sobbing. Breaking down. She hasn’t cried like that in a while, not since him. Not since she told him how he hurt her, not since she remembered how he hurt her.   She tells the boyfriend, just like she told him, that she’s not strong enough for heartbreak again. Promised herself and owes it to him to not have extremes, but knows enough to understand and protect herself yet she’s a different person now, she’s stronger.  But why does she question though? Why are there always some nights where she lets him get to her? And why are there always some nights she feels so terribly insecure?  Dumb really.  The boyfriend wants to help her. Begs her to stop. Watches her, attempts to guide her, sometimes even intrudes into her bubble uncomfortably, desperate to heal her I guess. “Don’t do it baby,” “It’s going to be okay, I fucking swear to you,”   Bulimic fucking reject.  She feels ugly and old. Fat. Oversized and disgusting. Terribly disappointed in herself and the person she is, the person she became.   Why does she let him get to her? Why do the wounds still bleed when he attacks? Why isn’t there such a thing as forgive and forget?  She watches.  She sees.  She understands.  Time to move on, these walls have crumbled and its foundation torn down. He hurts her again.   Live and learn.  Let.Go.

       construction.   he rolls over. half asleep. half dreamy and silly and whispers those three words.   i laugh, snort, giggle and scream at the same time. wanting to yell at him and say, "what the fuck?" but you know what they say about people being asleep and being compared to blatant honesty when you're drunk and it's slipped out.   holy shit. holy shit. holy shit.  ----  breaks down today, tears in his eyes and hurt aching through. i want to hold him in my arms and take away all the pain and draw him close and soothe him till all is gone. his one and only grandparent left and now he's alone. pallbearer he tells me. i say it'll be okay and he takes that long drive there and back, sleeping in between heartache and headache. it sucks to be sad and sick at the same time and i wish i could find the words. i'm sorry.  you don't have to be strong all the time, it's okay. i promise.  ----  finds me when i'm tired, cranky and sick of the whole fucking world.   when someone else has broken me down, he picks up scraps of me to dust me off. and we talk.  we talk like we've never talked before.  we talk about life and love and letting go and moving on and mistakes. finality and all things that must come to an end. we talk about  my addiction and his. we talk about our demons and the things we fear. but yet we laugh a lot. we laugh till our sides hurt and laugh somemore. we laugh because it's silly. we laugh maybe because it's love.  ----  he bangs and sings and strums and jams. he plays to his little sold out crowd and signs for his little fans.  runs around and sets up and catches me in between cigarettes and photographs to sneak in a kiss and a hug or two. and runs along again doing his own thing so i have time to do mine.  and he tells me he believes in me and my dreams and that he knows i can do it. and we talk about two years from now. and we talk about our careers and lives we want to lead. and i tell him how immensely fucking talented he is, and he thinks we happened for a reason, that i've completed his life. but i know, no, he's completed mine.  he's made me finally worth it.   i thought friendship meant more things. maybe i thought it would be stronger, that the part about being friends come what may would ring true but last night, desperation on some new level won out and sold out. i'm tired of backlash and nit-picking, saying the wrong things and doing worst. it's over.   perhaps we should leave it at nothing.  you break and break and let someone break you so many times it gets old. redundant. same bloody damn story again. only that i'll try this time, and fight back and tell you no, not this time. not anymore times.   funny how you put the question in my mind. the what if. the maybe we just needed to go do our own things on our own for a while and come back and it'll be perfect only i realize now it'll never be perfect. there'll always be something wrong, and something fucked up and something not right.  you've never seen me smile or heard my laugh. you've never held my hand or wiped away a tear. you don't know the things i do nor have you tasted my cooking, heard me sing, watched a show. i've never seen you, never touched you, never really known you at all. maybe we've been caught in a fucking lie, perhaps you were right after all, maybe we weren't real. maybe it was just bullshit.  well keep your bullshit then. i'm done with you.   and i'll work on me now. the fucked up little child gets help. the fucked up little child is finally going to be something.  so i get depressed, so i get extremes, so i throw up and starve myself. so so so...so what?  i'm tired of this life and i'm tired of the person i am with you. i'll find me a new life now. i'll make me a new life.  i'll change and fucking bleed stuffing myself and smiling myself full. i'll learn about confidence and about being stronger because i know i'm strong enough for this. i know i'll fucking make it and i know i'll bloody do this.  and you can stand on your edge and laugh at me. and you can stand on your side and say more hurtful things and pull me down a while but i know now that being nothing and everything at the same time is not what i want.  you question why i ring you. stupid me thought i was comfortable with you, stupid me thought we'd actually make it this time. well fuck that, fuck the past right? simply just forget and let go eh?  and i remember you telling me that you hope im sorry someday.  and i am.   i'm sorry because you'll never see me for the things i am and the things i can be. i'm sorry that revenge gets in the way of trust. i'm sorry you've lost my trust and hurt me again. i'm sorry this is again.   call this immaturity. call this being the bigger person. call this finally doing something we've talked about forever. call this letting go.  i know what i want and what i need now. i think i'll go away a while and work on me, and dreams i've finally let myself dream again.  endings don't always need to be painful.   they just need to be simple.  goodbye.

      About five minutes ago, I was horny. Now I'm just trying to stay the fuck rational. Hell knows I don't want to go to sleep crying tonight, after all, the Muse is happy tonight right? Was anyway.  Mind against Heart.  Don't let it get to you, let it go.  It's not worth it damnit, it's not worth it.   I try to remember all that was said in yesterday's session, how blatantly honest I had become in those few minutes. I found all the answers I had been looking for, subconsciously knowing they were within, perhaps just not knowing where to look.  Perfect tore away at Passion, I like all the parts I had talked about changing. Essentially a good person really, just gets too carried away. Guarded now, Control has to lay frigid hands to rule, keep in check. Never try free falling again, why pick away at old scabs?  A test. A measurement to see how far you've come...Sorry some day. Tommorow, Yesterday or next Week? Forgiveness is a key to Kindness, she tells me Mind needs to be gentle with Heart. That the insecure messed up person in me is really okay; that session scared me. Opened me.  The initial high came crashing down at  urlLink Marc's , thoughts jumbled up and a meal desperately attempting to be digested. Palm on skin, tumor beneath flesh, sanity prevailing sinking on the line.  My insecurities can bite my ass, tonight I am Enough.  Tomorrow I am Beautiful.  Forever I am Special.  I believe that, I think I might really.   I am good enough, strong enough, Enough.  and I won't let you convince me again I'm not  ...even if you still Hurt me  Tear me apart, feed me to the wolves;  So I am evil, so I am bad, so I am all the things you constantly tell me I am, so what?  at least I am still Fighting, and I will still hang on to my Dreams.  You have no idea how precious these dreams are to me...Life.     urlLink "let it go-the smashed word broken open vow or the oath cracked length wise-let it go it was sworn to              go   let them go-the truthful liars and the false fair friends and the boths and neithers-you must let them go they were born              to go   let all go-the big small middling tall bigger really the biggest and all things-let all go dear             so comes love"

      I’m busy, busy, busy it’s not even funny. Hell you try maintaining eighteen credit hours, getting fit, keeping the social ‘in’, staying sane and doing the whole movie thing. It’s interesting, crazy ass hectic and tiring as stitch but all good honey!  Auditions on Monday was just absolutely beautiful…the director seemed really nice and it was the best feeling walking out of there knowing I kicked ass. You know how racheal’s confidence level gets but dahyum, that was a good audition. :P  It’s funny how people try to hide how excited they are and mask it with all the talk and crap and you’re sitting there just thinking, hell yeah, you want me don’t you? * giggle *  I do have to say though that being Asian helped seeing as I didn’t see too many other Asians audition for Thai’s part and it is supposed to be apparently written for an Asian girl but I won’t get too excited. :P  It’s nice to feel so happy though. Proud, like I did something right and it feels really good!  Whoop. Whoop.  Now, to memorize those two damn monologues, 55 pages of homework and dinner tonight.   Hehe, god I’m delirious like a little school girl!  :P  I can’t begin to tell you how good it feels to be smiling again after that god of all fuckers week I had…we did this whole new approach with Gayle last night and that whole social stigma thing about seeing a therapist? I can only say that up yours because if I get to figure out as much as I did last night and feel as good as I do now, I’ll deal with it!  :)   urlLink  "Our bodies are made for pleasure.

      Sometimes you don’t need reasons, you just try.  Everything fades and reappears again, reality searches back for you and peels away layer after layer. Orange skin that dehydrates by the sunlight by the mirror, reflection stares back at you and you break down.  Invade me, come into my corner and join me, understand me.  sarah, where the hell have you gone child? Where the hell have you been?  I used to know you when you were different, when you’d twirl around in your little pink dress and sing to yourself. Hum a tune and prance around with so much joy, so much heart beneath those eyes. What’s wrong honey, what happened?  I watch you now and you are so broken, so confused. I watch you tear at your hair and push away the tears, the anger, the hurt. Mind versus Heart. You question, I listen to you abuse, rack yourself but the eyes never lie honey, sound travels. You pretend you’ve hidden it so well, but you’re still so naïve child, still so much to learn.

      Sleepy as fuck and going to bed.  Thank you, you.   Maybe I needed that good cry, or you behind the door knowing I was hurting and begging to be let in. Maybe I needed that extra pack of ciggarettes and that violation of trust I fucked while yelling at you. Screaming at you not to touch me and just go the fuck away then driving back to your place many, many hours later to tell you I was sorry. The glimpse of acceptance in your eyes that welcomed me home, as you shared my phone calls and celebrated in my joy.  You are a gift to many, your friendship is as fragile as porcelain as solid as rock and I am thankful.  You are beautiful. I have your fingers tugging at my heart, your hands at my soul and you are among the reasons why my living hell seems so much more calmer when you are around. I watch while you are singing, proud of you...jumping up and down saying, did you see that? did you see that?   I hurt while you are hurting and I'm sorry he still breaks your heart time and time again. The painful tears you cry when you are tired of the world makes me hurt too. Fathers are a weird specimen on their own aren't they? Don't let him take you down silly, don't shy away.  You are enough and complete as a person. Your dreams are still there just like they were before. You make me a better person, having you by my side teaches me I am worth it. I tell you these things, begging you to constantly believe me yet I violate your trust too when you mention his name. When you bring up pain I turn around with spite and bitch.  I'm healing though, and I know you see it too. One day, I knew I'd see just like you saw me too.  Thankyou.

         urlLink  “You are a child of the Universe... No less than the trees or the stars themselves, You have a right to be here.”    Nightly visits from the Shallot, my heart dreams of breaking free from this tirade, this charade. Open masks that melt like chocolate…so sweet, so wanted. Eternal ecstacy that breaks from happiness, the need to get stripped and naked torments. The need to peel off the layers and come home hounds; who am I exactly?   urlLink Colorgenics  tests I make everyone take, he vehemently denies my theory…only to find an email telling me the truth. Right, right, right, wrong. Honesty is beautiful isn’t it?  It’s as if we are all hidden in our own layers, all locked up into our own fears. You aren’t the only one, you are not alone, it’s okay. Being there and feeling safe, the moments he sheds the image and shows heart. You find the not so strong, not so big side he’s willing to show you…and it is beautiful.  Midnight beach football, soft Spanish music that plays in an old forgotten diner. He sings you beauty in a foreign language, shows you love in friendship.   Broken down again, in the middle of a crossroad trying to find your way. Your place in the world, your mark, your strength. So many externalties cascade you from different angles, and so many fears compound your insecurities.  Casting call today, headshots prepared with only the flaws apparently only your eyes see. Tick, tick, tick, the seconds loom. You are afraid, excited, monotone. Worked out the stress and pressures, ex-boyfriend on campus, gym equipment at my disposal, self-abuse in regalia. Getting in shape, kicking some ass, healing with love.  Safe people surround me, carry me when the days are bad.  I am a child of the Universe yesterday, today and tommorow.  I am a product of Love.  Loved.     urlLink "It is here for no reason but to make you ask for a reason."

       “her ex boyfriend (the one who treated her like shit no less, raped her, and dumped her when she had cancer)” Familiar?    I am immortalized by his being, his words ignite fire in me. Translucent and clinging to the air I breathe, clasping on fluidly to gentle words, lips forming sounds, coherent thoughts, indecision, and conflict. Drama, bigger than life itself, I smile.  Sexual tension is beautiful. Selfish, but giving, Frustrated, but understanding, so everything not only harbors on Lust…don’t want to strip again, don’t want anyone to come close.    I am angry. Incredibly frustrated with myself, my being. Not able to forgive and still affected ; he breaks me down again. He pierces through the layers the others have helped heal and stabs again. The tears fall, against my will, swipe away…swipe away…fall. You’re not worth it. And that’s all that’s left chanting in my mind, nevermind how far I’ve come, his disapproving, debilitating stare has gunned me down. Pawn.    He holds me, hugs me. Rubs my back when my heart pounds, pounds, pounds against my will. As if it will explode any second and my chest contracts beyond all pain imaginable and I cry. I scream inside but physically too scrunched up to do anything. Only these attacks tell me I am still alive, only these attacks tell me I still have a heart. I cling on to comfort, but shield away from security. I’ll build my own walls, thank you very much, I’ll fight my own battles. Alone.     I am left in the center. The beginning of an ending that feels shortchanged. We are prisoners locked in our own worlds, but yet he chooses to take my key…or maybe I gave it away too soon. Or maybe I’ve lost it forever. He’ll always hold it won’t he? He grins. Superior power in his hands ; and he knows it. That ability, the one he questioned me about, Revenge. Ego. Submission.     We drive. We drive for hours and hours, on long winding roads, and half assed bumpy paths only to find ourselves on this never ending journey. I have found a friend, I have found someone that cares, loves…but I cannot seem to love him.  I let him in, but with every brick that I take down, four goes back up. It’s as if with everything emotional, everything that constitutes thoughts and a heart; I take one step forward and twelve steps back.      I throw sticks and stones. Wanting to turn my back and not care when he’s hurting, not be bothered when he questions.  I remember Christmas, and New Year. I remember he is selfish and unforgiving, spiteful and indifferent. That he hates me and I deserve better, deserve someone who loves, believes, trusts in me.      Go Away. Run. Leave. Let Go. Search. Move on…whatever.    It’s as if God looks down and mocks me. Irony spears through and little boys and little girls of every type and nature feed off this insecure, broken, extremely confident, happy, sad, crazy aura that surrounds me. I am beautiful in disharmony, strong in breaking down.  Attractive? Scary.  I’m indecisive, I don’t want to make decisions…commitments. I run,  and even they know it.    Just thinking out loud.       urlLink  "The sounds of water, it sings to me; the smell of water, the fragrance refreshes my soul; the silky soft current weave in and out and in and out gracefully from between stones, I’ll never forget that beauty. I laugh, I smile, I drop the pretty wild flowers in my hand, I dip my fingers into the cool water, when I look up at you again, and you’re gone already."

To your credit you are attempting to escape from this by endeavoring to create a semblance of peace and serenity by refusing to allow yourself to be involved. You have the strength to 'pull through' and all indications are that you will... perhaps sooner than you even believed possible."     er, yeah, exactly.

      I would laugh, or on normal shitty days, let the tears fall…but maybe you build up mechanisms in you to shield you from all the soul-searching, heart-wrenching bullshit.  Tonight was…weird. Weird into a new context.  I was invisible and right there, in the middle and to the sidelines. All eyes on you but hiding, that god damn bitch in you that says, oh fuck off. Deal with it. Whine to somebody else. La di da…woe is me, skip di lee doo da.  Hating the idiots that blow smoke up your arse and blame little insignificant problems on everything and anything, getting angry because the smart ass didn’t learn her lines and we spent too much time on so short a scene, wasting a perfectly good Saturday afternoon. One that should have been spent with friends, basking in just being alive, whooping in the audacities collegiate life offers.  Feeling the effects of a whole week of stretching muscles and relieving fat, of Friday’s swing dancing and too many late nights. Nevermind the twenty-six hour sleepless binge being rung up at odd hours this week with three hundred and seventy two million things/pound on my shoulders that I so gallantly, and proudly, carry.  Ice skating tonight, the glorious feel of sliding…as if floating. So swift, so tender, wind through your hair, smooth white ice beneath you and a rink full of friends. Partners with old souls, coffee and forbidden cigarettes with the books and scripts over heart-to-hearts and ex-boyfriends. Mouthing off to the bastard that proudly, bitchily walks over and hurts him. staring him down with the, ‘if I ever as to so far see your damn skanky ugly white thrash face again..’ and ending it off with him knowing that the friend is far better off without him.  And I thought all gay men were nice.  ---  Sober now, sorry cartwheeling ass dragged out. Boogie-ing, door thumping in the lavatory as you patiently wait and grin, your knowing eyes that flashes to the next person behind you in line, there are beds upstairs you know. Keg-stands, ass-kicking and big band swinging, frat boys and sorority girls, induction and seduction. A nice hodge-podge mix really, an interesting combination.  Affected but you lie. Smile through your damn adversary bitch.    I’d really say more things, but taking the whole blog into consideration, the last whole year and a half has been an emotional rollercoaster. A drama-filled whiny decaying insecure daily speech. Woe is me, pity me, I mock them…only to find three fingers pointing back at me.  Becareful of what you preach.  Be wary of what you write.  Go to sleep delusional, the sun has already risen.   urlLink  "Sometimes I wish I wasn't such an introspective navel gazing thinker. "

      The girl says I intrigue her.  She holds my hands in hers, clasping it tightly knowing that I might jerk away at any second. At any time, my walls may come haltingly up again.  Her eyes stare deep into mine. Her big round American blue eyes, she pierces me with her feelings, her deep hidden thought and emotions. She is a person of action, not words yet everything she has to say is brain candy. Intelligent, brilliant, beautiful.  She is breathtaking...  She holds me close again, and we lie down, covered up, bunched together in the cold and look at the stars. Clear, cold, cold, night….every asteroid is burning so brightly, moonlight encases us into a fairy tale, an enchanted evening.   ---  We have that relationship conversation again. He wants a special place in my life, a piece of my heart, a window into my soul.   I laugh and tell him he’s silly, stupid. I am not a girl he wants to love, I am not a girl that’s capable of loving or being loved, but it doesn’t mean that I don’t enjoy it either.  He’s caring, he makes me dinner and walks with me. Nature looks so much more tantalizing through his eyes, life seems so much more interesting with him around. Larger than life, more vibrant, more colorful, just bigger….better.  His mind attracts me the most, nevernmind that he is quite aesthetically pleasing too. Yummy.  My lips have never touched his though. Never really lead him on, I hope. If anything, just made it clearer and clearer boundaries. Invisible lines; but you can still feel the tension.  Things are out between us, but he slowly chisels off his way into the inside. I push him away ferventently, continuously.  Ask Jared, he’ll tell you why you don’t want to know me. See me. Love me. He’ll tell you why it’s bad.   So we talk, laugh a while. Silently waiting, silently wanting.  Emptiness filling and caving in more, Afraid.  ----  Competitors. Behind, at the back of my mind, I wonder if it’s all just a game. Predator, Hunter, Pawn, Bait.   They come and go in succession. Each needing to be filled, each wanting to be loved. Outgoing, shy, arrogant, giving, caring, loud, flirtatious, quiet, silly, funny, intelligent, talented. Brewing, melting, cascading pot of interests. A plethora of personalities. One to another to the next and a day, some are in classes, some are random, some are friends of a friends of a friends. Some go dancing with me, some play video games, watch movies, work out and some, just dinner and parties.  Sheep. Blind deceived sheep. Oblivious to the being within, they fall into the image. The life. The show she puts on, the layers she brushes on, the glittery wrapping paper and the expensive bow for the Dollar General gift.  ---   The old man. The best friends. The safe people that see her at night, when she is heaving and sobbing, the ones that put their hands on her heart and stop the blood from gushing. The ones that see her when she’s weak and lends her their strength a while. The ones that understand and help her through another night, carries her through another day.   The ones she goes to when she needs to feel special, when she needs to know that at least one person on earth knows who she is within inside. When she can’t pretend anymore, when she is tired of being the happy, laughy, giggly person. When she is breaking.  Hurting.  ---  The boy that still remains so hugely a part of her life. Suppressing thoughts and feelings even if she still cares; life moves on, let go damnit.  Untouchable.   Other side.   Disconnected.  Broken up.  ---  The words that come flowing out of her mouth, the thoughts that leap onto paper and castrate themselves. The touchy-feely emotions she pens out daily in regression, in anger, in depression, in ecstasy.  They think she is manic-depressive. All the extremes, the highs and lows. As if a solitary diagnosis explains everything, why she feels like she’s failing and falling, the eating disorder, the insecurities, the relationships. Growing up too soon in a large, tormenting, cruel world.  The flip side of being sensitive, she is an actress. Vivid, poignant, dramatic. She escalates and drives a character through, she gets deep within and feels it from the core. She fits right into the theater group, all weird, all  different  yet she disguises and weaves her way too into the musicians, and the painters. The cheerleaders, and the nerds, the geeks and the jokers. The bums and the lost. She feels, she is sensitive, she chooses pain over numbness, she chooses creativity over nothingness, she chooses extremes over the in betweens. She chooses to be driven instead of just being content, instead of losing dreams and aspirations.  They say people choose their own poison and that my life is a testament.  Eighteen years of existence, so much and nothing to testify for.   So much left to live for. Dream for.  So much more that I can be and I can try.   So many decisions left to make and paths yet to take.  Will she make it? Will she crumble? Will she smile with the little tiara on her head?  Time, the essence, as always will tell;  I haven’t turned out yet.     urlLink  "Maybe falling back on memories isn't such a bad thing anyway.

      I must have at least fifty layers on…nevermind that right as I run the bath I use up  all  a significant amount of our hot water but yeah, eighteen degrees outside? Damn it, if it’s going to be this cold, I should be able to make snow angels! Gah.  :P  on another thread though..   do ut des   naked imperialism says that apparently my torturous limbo constitutes the all important question of theology against theatrics. I mean, fuck my faith, but damn it, how far does your basic necessity to believe the being up there take you? Semitic thrash really, thoughts that invade my pagan mind when running across campus with the crazy, screaming, nut chasing after me, hitting me with his bible full of verses and challenges.  Sure, I humor him. Smile as I hurry in to avoid the cold, yeah, laugh if you may at how many pounds I’ve put on just by the coats but we’ll see who’s sorry ass freezes eh?   But he questions.   “where’s your faith, little child, where’s your faith?”   I don’t know mister.  (half open, half closed]  Sacred versus Vulgar.  A good shit novel of deals with god; promises, agreements, discussions.  I smile again, at your latest entry. Figuring out your codes, encrypted. Running through in my mind and pointing out who Rhett is, or the Strad.  I wonder how you’re doing old man. Are you tired of the crazy, crazy world too? Or did Love find you along the way and introduced you to Hope. Hope is a friend, an aquaintance. She’s nice to me sometimes, she finds me. Or I find her: same difference.  Morning classes are fun, nothing like starting off the day discussing black literature with the Substitute. Have I told you about the Substitute?  The substitute rocks my socks. Rox my sox.   The weekend is here. FINALLY here. You wait and wait and wait, swing dancing, parties, clubbing, friends, aimless wandering and Freedom. On the way to the gym now, going to work out with the ex and his ex and me and ‘friend of a friend of a friend’s competitor. This should be  interesting.   I talked to the Boy last night. The main Ex.   Waffle House sessions won’t even come close to the theories I have about this one, it’s all a conspiracy I swear, bring down the bitch!  I love this sporadic, half not there writing.  No more cancer sticks on me, sob-sob, I was going to tell you about the little girl.  She feels fragile now. There but not there you know? Healing but afraid, happy but impatient, content but searching. All them oxymorons, all them extremes. Oh well.  Barren platonic redundant talk, they find obsecinity in raping my soul. That’s what I told her yesterday, that reading this place was like tapping into the birthplace of my insecurities. They call it honesty, I call it suspended disbelief.   The moments I escape, let go, and run free.  The moments I’m just me, and it’s okay right?  You all think you know me, as if you’ve figured me out with my idiosyncracies and problems and stupidity. You think you know, but you don’t even come close to anything at all, frankly, just because I don’t either. But then again, you know how it’s always clearer from the outside looking in? Maybe.  But she's different in Reality isn't she? She's more secure, more hidden, more Confident.   I'll find that bitch and make her tell me her secrets.  Then I'll be more secure too, more hidden, more confident.  sounds good.  Now what were you up at  urlLink this  hour, silly?  I'm flattered.   urlLink  "She stands still, afraid to move a muscle; afraid the movement will ripple as a pebble thrown into a calm pond, causing the dream to fade."

      Still celibate, because I know you thrive and jerk off my (non-existent) sex life, but very content.  That whole need to be romanced thingamagic thing we talked about? Well, tonight we put aside all fears, all wants, all needs, shoved it next to our summer bikinis and roughly discarded open toed slippers at the bottom of the wardrobe. Tonight we were little lovers, giggling, losing ourselves into our own little worlds.  I could pretend he was him and he could pretend I was her. In our own world we held hands, and he hugged me from behind when we went to get soda and fought like little kids laughing all the way and throwing popcorn. Acting like silly retarded juveniles stuck in grown up bodies. We made people jealous, we did just like you explained and made everyone want to slap us hard.  I was happy tonight. I even put on a baby pink shirt on top of the white ensemble to humor you. I felt like a princess tonight, perfect and beautiful. Enchanted as if untouchable, so cried out, so broken torn that all we could do from here was mend. Was fix. Was be happy.  And we even played the dancing game and kicked some good sorry ass.   Two points!!  It was weird driving there though, the broken cd player as if a testament to last week’s events. The empty ackward silence a while, not knowing what to say or where to start. Apologizing profusely on both parts, him because he cornered me into some place I wasn’t ready for, and me because of the way I reacted.  So we hugged and made up. And he asked about Gayle and I asked about Mary. As if this whole seeing a therapist thing was normal, well, that’s California for you. We did highs and lows, and he apologized again for compromising friendship and I laughed and talked about just how damn irresistible I was.   And he promised to make me my Chinese dinner because it’s that animal instinct thing again. The jealousy, the living up to what the other does. The I’ll give you bigger, better, stronger. I laugh and tell him he’s stupid and silly because I sure as hell would not like to be compared to the other girls. Hard to explain uniqueness and difference to people that won’t listen, hard to explain individuality and how one person differs from another.  I can’t make him my Jared, and I sure as hell don’t want him to be my Franklin. I just want to enjoy his company, who he is, his special qualities and bask in that a while. It’s fun. I don’t want to get too close, but I enjoy getting to know someone again.  There’s so much shit from everything else that sometimes I wish I could just shove it someone else’s ass but I’ll deal with it. I don’t have a choice but I’ll be right.  It’s the coldest it’s been in quite a while, everything freezes over and pauses a while, as if caught in a trance. Everything is put on pause or moving so extremely slow it is dictated. I may be hurting, and I may still feel the need to cry sometimes, but every day is another day of getting better, of feeling better. With spring comes dying and growing again remember? Hope.  I’m okay, don’t worry silly-billy.    urlLink  "kiss yourself if you're in a warm place."

      I do this once every few months…clean up my inbox. And for the most part, it is fun, fun to see how I’ve changed and how my thoughts have differed from how they are now. Sure, there’s always going to be pain but gotta take out your trash you know?  It must be the coldest day on earth today, well at least in Florida anyway. I hate the cold weather, I hate how the chill gets into your bones and fucks you up that way. Or how you shiver, shiver, shiver.   It would be nice to have someone to share hot chocolate and marshmallows with, someone just to curl up and read by the fire. Fall asleep to. Him.  I miss abominable snowman days, when his great big coat will suffocate my little frame and I’d get lost somewhere in between. Or how we’d laugh and play in the cold, making out, creating music, exchanging ideas and thoughts.   You know what? Maybe, just like how you were saying last night, I am something. The whole intimidation thing? Well, I don’t know how baseless your theory is, or even if there’s any spine of truth to it…but what I do know is that it is nice to be the other person. It’s fun to come into school and have a selection to pick from, guy a for Monday, guy c for Tuesday and girl b for Wednesday.   All harmless flirtation really, everyone’s just looking for their soul mate. Company. Friendship. Everyone just looking to be understood and loved, looking to love.  And I do understand that, which is perhaps for the most part, why I play along with it. It’s a nice feeling to be desired, I shy away when you say such nice things but everytime you do, you know it puts a smile on my face too.  Thank you I guess.  You know when I’ve been in to see Gayle. I am so much calmer from this morning, less edgy, less manic, just sorta almost peaceful. I don’t sleep much I think because my demons tear me up, they tell me things like I need him, and sometimes I end up believing it. Bad. Very bad.   Because I don’t right?  Because I am enough on my own and what was it about me having to find someone who could love as much and appreciate me? Someone who can understand the cycles and the chemical imbalance, saratonin bullshit was it?  You think he/she exists? You think I’ll find that one mad crazy person that’s going to love the other mad crazy person and we won’t ever tear each other apart?  Well, I guess I’ll keep my fingers crossed then.  Want to know what the crazy thing is? It’s that I’m sitting here, completely dressed in white with my hair tied up, my nails done and just enjoying this moment.  I’ve had a nap since the twenty six hour binge and sleep does wonders don’t you think?  I am intelligent, and I am attractive. I have dignity, and I have worth. I may not always be right, but I am not always wrong either, I am allowed to have opinions and thoughts. They shape me to be who I am. I am emotionally highly strung out sometimes, but that just adds to loving me as a person right? I cannot apologize for being who I am, for my eating disorders, my chemical imbalance and being sick, but I will apologize for being the not so nice person I become when I’m like that. I may not always like who I am and I may always push me further and further to achieve more and unrealistic greater things, but that differentiates me from a spineless drop out with no dreams that I fear myself becoming.   I laugh, because no one has the answers. We can search, and cry, and scream about it, but when all is done, still have to find it. Live through it. Deal with it.  I refuse to sit here tonight and write another sad entry, so instead I will go out and have fun. Superficial or not, I like my laugh. And I like myself a lot when I’m laughing, even more so when I can laugh at myself.  I am not perfect. I just forget sometimes.  That little girl that searches in the mirror? She’s still there, she still exists. She just gets tired sometimes, that’s all. But she’s fighting back, and being the smart ass she is, you know she’ll get what she wants.   I am secure enough to know I’ll make it, but still shaken enough to know I need to press on and stay strong.  I love you back, thank you for the entries.   urlLink  "We can laugh as it dances in the breeze. Hold my hand, little girl. Let's walk."

      I’m not going.  Another reason, another dagger, another good cry.  Sometimes I wonder if anybody even understands me at all? So many times I find myself here again, searching…alone. Trying to fend off these beasts that violently torment me, these vulcans that devour my living flesh, picking at me till I am empty and torn, picking at me that I have no place to run, no place to hide, no solitude to seek..  I started crying twelve hours ago. I let the tears touch my pillow and soaked it, I let my heart cry out and soothed it. Wanting to cry it all over and still wanting to be strong at the same time.   I don’t understand why.   I try to look at myself in the mirror this morning and remember what bryan told me a long time ago. Tell yourself you’re beautiful each morning sweetheart; I see tired worn out eyes, I see a soul that’s hurting, fighting against time. Against herself, against the rest of the world. I see a little girl that’s afraid to be seen, that really wants to please, that’s so scared of trying. I see someone who’s trying to make it and  pretends so beautifully that she does, I see someone that used to believe in herself and had hope. I see all these things, but I can’t find Beauty. Would you please tell her I’m here?  Would you please tell her to find me?  This morning she rings, just like every other morning. Begins with wanting to know if I’ve had my pills, if I’ve had anything solid in the last few hours. Same old, same old. Asks me about my day…I lie, pretend as usual. It all went good, Mom, it all went good. Don’t worry, Mom, I’m okay, don’t worry, Mom, I’m doing fine. I pretend to be irked that she’s rung me so early, and she explains again, like every other morning, that it’s midnight their time and she likes talking to her babies before she goes to bed.  Then she tells me they don’t think it’s a good idea at all.   I am lost, as if confused. I thought maybe someone would be proud of me, I thought maybe someone would say, you did good, Racheal, you did good. If I didn’t have his congratulatory hug, I thought maybe my parents would give it to me. But they didn’t, I guess it reaches a point where nothing shocks them anymore huh? No big deal, what’s the Honor’s program and being selected to go got to do with it?  All this bullshit about getting well and being alone in the world.  I  am  alone in the world. I’ve been alone for so long, so hard now.   I don’t tell her, but I want to come home. I want to forget everything and give up. I want to run away and hide from the rest of the world a while…I want the nightmares to be over and I just want to be okay. I want to shield myself from me, and draw strength from someone else a while.  I want to really, honestly, just be okay.   ”Smile for me little princess, sing for me like a child. “   I am feeling icky, icky, bad today. Not strong, not happy, not even anything enough to pretend. I am hurting, and I can’t even remember all the reasons why, except like the crying, I’m afraid that if I start I cannot stop. And I haven’t.  Drug me.  Saratonin levels bad? Racheal bad? Racheal bad boo boo mistake not worth it?  I don’t know. I don’t care.  It hurts.  I’m hurting.  I said it now, I’m honest; why won’t it go away?  Why am I not worth pride, and love, and understanding?  Why am I, once you reach my very core, not worth anything?  I try again, but this time I am only putting a bigger band aid, on a bigger wound.    urlLink  "Please use "I TALK COCK IN THIS SITE" instead. "

        I have given you everything I am, taken everything you are.   And the questions? The questions will always confuse and the answers always linger…but sooner or later, it will fade. Sooner or later, when bare, naked necessity dictates it, it’ll all come around.   Gullible imp, if anything I am. Deceiving witch, if anything I could be.   We knock and scrape at heaven’s door, begging the gods to release us of this curse. This curse of uncertainty and disarray. Make me a mark of misogyny you say, make me hate thine passions thirst with a wrath so great it dispels need. Or trust. Or love.  Remember this when I am weak and tired again, remember this when I fall and break, scratched up and bleeding.   I am alone.   I'll let you break your promises, strip me of my pride and make sense of us by tearing me apart. I'll let you mock me, and take cheap shots at who I am as a person, and who I'll be in coming days. I'll sit here and stare, and when my putrid salty tears touch the ground, I'll let it rot the soil, and kill the earth; all the while masking this face of strength and dignity, all the while masking this emotionless face of disregard.   You come back, as they always say, and beg me for forgiveness. You've taken time to finally understand the reasons why I pushed you away; afraid of love, insecurity, disorder. I want not to blame it on my disease, to blame it on the state of my being, but what other explanation is there? I remember the fucked up child business, I think it hurt most because I actually think you were right.   It takes a while for me to trust you again. Someone else is in my life, putting on more layers, like a band-aid over a broken wound...only temporary. Takes me a while to realize too.  But you leave again. You've pushed me to unleash these feelings and emotions that have taken months and months to bury. Phone calls that drive me to explain everything, questions that question and question and question. You want to know why I lied, you want to know why I fucked up, you want to know if I still have a soul, if I am still human.  You break this sheen of hardness that protects me and I sob. I break down and you tell me that for once in your life, you finally understand why I couldn't do it. Why it hurt so bad. Why I couldn't go through us again, the loneliness, the emptiness, the stabbing. I didn't want to lose you again, I didn't want to have to go through losing you again.   Then for a while we are good. Or I am good rather. I've come back renewed, the wounds healing and something in me has changed. Something in all of us has changed. I am good for a while, but not long after that, the nights begin again...only that this time, these are your nights. I cannot complain, I cannot whine, I cannot fight back. I have no voice, I try patience but you've always known the right words the pierce through, I understand where you're coming from but comprehension doesn't disregard the right of emotions.  I feel.   I'm human too you know? I forget sometimes too.  One night, as if by epiphany, I realize I’m still in love with you. And I still love you. I realize when he tells me to move in with him, and I know I can’t. I can’t move off some place else, as much as I’d like too…I’ve tried that before, that’s why I’m here remember? Because I was trying to run, escape. So I packed my bags, and moved continents, I thought maybe, perhaps, I don’t know. being in the same place didn’t help either, I’d severed us long before, too much damage done I suppose.  I am the idiot now. I’ve always been haven’t I? When I had it all, I fucked it up. I changed you, you say. I made you into the cold, hard, cynical beast that you claim you are, that you want to be. I still see someone I used to know sometimes though, I still see him sometimes…when he lets me see him I suppose. I remember all the nights you asked me why you weren’t the one anymore. And I remember all the nights you asked if I still loved you and if I would ever love you again and I told you, no. I told you I couldn’t love you anymore and that I’d fucked up forever. That I couldn’t handle just being enough and just being enough didn’t cut it. I wanted to be special in your life, I wanted to be everything I was before I destroyed it.   I lied. You’re still that guy. I realize now, but then I know being the hard headed ass I am, I’ll reach that stage some day and let you go. I don’t want to hurt you anymore, frustrate you, piss the living bejesus out of you.   I hide, go away and take you off my lists. I attempt to cocoon myself into security, see no evil, hear no evil right? I miss you though, I hate it that I do. I hate it that I have to go through this bullshit of feeling…wouldn’t the world be just nice if we didn’t have to feel?  I still read you from time to time. Sometimes, it feels as if I’m violating your privacy, but then again I cannot help but selfishly wonder, are certain things directed at me? Well, they work pretty well then, because when you put on that cloak and throw sarcasm at me, it still hurts. It’ll always hurt, some part of me will always want approval from you, will always want you to be proud of me. Some part of me is always going to want, at the end of the day, to tell you about it.   The stupid part of me still cares. When you talk about doing stupid things to yourself, I worry. And when you talk about hurting and being alone, I wish we could forget our stupid fights and disagreements and I could put my arms around you and give you love. Or security. Or whatever you needed, filled that void for you, mended that crap for you. Lay it on me. Lay it on me.   Everybody wants me to start dating again. Some days, even I do. Sure, it’s always nice to have company you know? everybody says move on, get off my sorry butt and have fun. I’m young and there are plenty fishes in the sea right?  Maybe so. But I want this fish, this fish I killed. This fish I mutilated.   I fix me and it’s as if according to Murphy’s Law and I get sick again. I don’t even care anymore this time, sure, I’d like to be all healthy and shit but to go through all that again? I don’t know, maybe not huh? But I’m seeing someone and getting help, and the whole damn world and their mothers say that they are proud of me. My real world finally knows I have a disease now, it’s funny how supportive they are.   Damn mind games in my head that still play. It’s still hard for me, I still want someone to hold my hand and on nights which I’m not feeling too good about myself, say it’s going to be right. But I don’t want to worry anyone, so sometimes I just cry it off and take your remedy of sleeping and sometimes, I just give in.   You asked me the other day about my body. I don’t think I’ll ever be enough for you. I used to be shy around you, now I’m just ashamed.   I’m doing really good in school. Sometimes, I remember about what we used to talk about. I booked my return ticket five months ago, I thought maybe I’ll fly in through LA. I have to cancel it tomorrow…I get to go to Italy, and France, and Switzerland. Get to see all the things I’ve learned and put them into existence.  I wish things were like the way they were before, and I’d write you, hell, even call you to tell you about it. History Honors program. Pretty damn ironic huh?  I guess in some ways everything still happens for a reason. Fate decides what’s not meant to be I suppose. Lately I’ve questioned my faith, I used to be strong and I hate to say this but gullible. I liked that crappy innocence then, when nothing used to worry me and I’d climb mountains without worrying about falling. It’s sad I guess, but it’s okay. I’ll survive…you know I always do, and I know you will too.  I see you take more steps away with each passing day. Some part of me wants to cling on so bad, wants to just curl in your arms and feel you but then I realized that sometimes, loving means letting go. I’ve kept you for so long now, kept you in my craziness, my bitchiness, my insecurities and you don’t need that. You are right, you do deserve better. You do deserve someone who’s going to make you feel good and laugh all the time. I guess it hurts to say goodbye, and we’ve done that quite a few times.  I don’t know why I wrote this tonight. Maybe just to know that I’d be okay and maybe just to understand why I had to let you go again.  It's okay, you've left anyway. I understand, I'm not angry, not feeling, just sorry.  sorry.

      We’ve been playing phone tag for as long as I can remember…and so she rings tonight, I am busy, away. Soaking away in bubble glory trying to maybe drown out all my troubles. I don’t hear the phone ringing, forget to bother to check. It’s been hard to explain my distance these past few days, I don’t feel like talking.  I ring in and run through my messages, hastily deciding that I prefer my hermit life better. Haven’t had this in a while, haven’t had alone time…but do I really like it? I don’t know, that remains questionable.  I can’t really make out what she’s saying, just sobs and wretched empty cries. I ring back and dial again and again, convinced that even her parrot might pick up next.  I wonder if she’s doing fine. Of course not silly, she needs you.   I care, and I want to help. I want to listen and fix things for her…but I can’t. I don’t know how to, I am not strong enough to love her. Not weak enough to say no.   It is…complicating to say the least. You feel that two hour cross county drive coming soon? Well honey, let me tell you something, every night this week and last and the week before would have been perfect candidates.   I came home last night, and I don’t know if it was just hormones acting up or the actual realization that I was so alone. No one’s arms around my waist to hold me tight, no lips that would sneak kisses, no security…absolutely nothing; because I was afraid? I had it all and fucked it up. He leaned in to kiss my cheek and I brushed him away, then turned around and locked myself back into my four walls again.  How do I fill this emotional void and not get hurt again? How do I not let myself hurt me again? I just want it all to be over with, I just want it to be done.    But would that justify me letting someone into my life now? Hell no. I always tell you men are so evil and treacherous and awful but they are all the same. Men, women, all bad. Maybe I have commitment phobia, or maybe God just really messed up when he made me, couldn’t tell you.  Make-up works wonders you know? Make-up and a cold silver spoon on swollen, puffy eyes. Crying silently, softly to sleep again. She breaks, her bouts of depression pound in stronger and stronger; it seems as if the more structured and perfect her life gets outside, the more torn down she is inside. Maybe I can’t handle it, maybe I won’t accept that I can really be someone because that only brings in expectations and dreams, or maybe I’m just hormonal.  I see Gayle tomorrow, but I want nothing to explain this. I want to keep mum and cross my legs and tell her about how ‘good’ I’ve been this week. Tell her I haven’t looped, that I’ve made the conscious effort to not practice regurgitating this week. That for the last seven days, I have digested.  And I won’t tell if you won’t tell.  I’ve worked out every morning, every afternoon and every night this week. I’ve ran, danced, lifted, bladed, cycled, kick-boxed and walked off all my very sore muscles. I’ve slipped in the diet pills as well as lived on my one meal a day plan this week. Dinner, because dinner is with the family and I can avoid breakfast, and avoid lunch but I can’t avoid dinner. I made a promise to not throw up so it’s the masochist in me that finds the need to do this. That has the perverse pleasure/pressure in getting down to double digits, just seven pounds more to go. i want that whatever it's called bone to show, i like that. not the ribs, got that down two years ago, not the hips, got that down a year ago, not the collar bones...but the in between your breast bone and that. whatever it's called anyway.  Want to know the worst part of it?  Is that I feel guilty for it. Is that I have my two masked face and my two sided heart. That my brain is able to decipher that this is wrong and I need to fix it. That I am losing it and abusing the shit out of my body. Taking all my shitty selfish problems and making it all exterior. Things I can work on. The part that pisses me off?  That there isn’t just a book I can study off, or a script I can memorize. There is nothing concrete but just all about emotions and feelings and all that bullshit. All about what my self-worth is to me at that point, or how secure I feel about my own being. It doesn't help when you're in this industry, it doesn't help when you are attacked.  I lie when I say I’m stronger now. Because I think that this strength, or at least this battle of staying on top, has made me weaker.  Do I really want to do this charade? of dating and getting better and being happy?  No. I don’t know.  I only do it so no one bugs me about it.  I only do it so everyone will shut up and leave me alone and quit trying to fix me.   I am so different out of this html work. I am so different out of the Internet.  In ‘reality’, I am confident and happy. In reality, I am giggly and laughy, independent and secure. I am so many things that people want me to be, expect me to be, play me up to be.  Will you do an interview with the newspaper? Do you mind if we do a story on you? Would you consider joining our program? Are you interested in saving the world?  Sure. If it’ll make you happy, okay, why not?  Ever get the feeling where your whole heart feels so numb and painful at the same time? I think it feels a little like this right now. Crying but not really crying, crying but there’s no more tears left kinda thing. I understand, I get it, but things are always easier in theory you know?  Maybe I’m crying for punishment, maybe I’m crying for sickness, for innocence. Maybe I’m just crying out because I can, because it’s not fair. Because I’m at the prime of my life and I damn bloody well should be enjoying this. Because I damn bloody well really want to enjoy this.  I don’t even know what my point was in the first place. Except I keep on going on all these things and pretend as if I’m really interested, and maybe I am. Maybe I find them intelligent and charming and amazing. Maybe I do want to get to know them but do they really want to get to know me?  I don’t know. I don’t know the answers…which started the disagreement the other day. If I never let anyone in then how will I find someone to fill up this void? How will I let love in if I continuously push it out? If I continuously make up reasons not to be loved. If I continuously make myself unloved.  Because I don’t want to hurt someone again. Because I don’t want to reach out into thin air and grasp onto nothing. Because as hard as I try to forget and as hard as I do, I’ll still remember that steely click. I’ll still remember the loneliness. I’ll still remember losing someone, and having someone not there anymore. Not exist.  Why am I hurting tonight? couldn’t tell you really.  It’s been so long since I’ve been happy. Really truly completely happy. I think I just lie to myself some times…when I have streaks. Because really, it all comes crashing down anyway.  I don’t know why I’m here again.  I hate not knowing where I’m going. I hate not knowing how this works. I hate feeling so damn sorry for myself.  I hate being able to fix every damn thing else but myself.  ...but the good part is I'll probably be okay tomorrow. I'll be fine and bouncy again, just don't catch me at night though.  Not when I'm alone.   urlLink  "this is the time in my life where everything is falling apart, and at the same time it's all coming together."

      “Forgiveness is a gift you give yourself,”  …but what if it is the unforgiven. The sinners, the dirty, tainted shit. What now?   Ku menanti, seakan tangisan bidadariku menguasai langit terserlah yang menjadi bumiku, Ku berbisik, bertanya…adakah harapan di dalam dindingan ini? Adakah jawapan di semananjung gerakan ini?  Menanti…seakan mencari detik wajah yang melinangi air mukamu Menlintasi batasan yang terbahagi-bahagi di antara maruah and keperluan Diketahui, tidak dinyatakan, tidak disoali Ku menhitung, mengira Melapiskan wajah yang tidak tentu, tidak benar.  Anda terlepas  Menyoal..  Tidak tahu.  …aku kian faham  Anda bukan gerisan yang kucari lagi  Anda dipertunjukan.  Pertukaran.  Aku Tentu.    Oligopoly exists. A synergy that moves, conforms by the superior hands of media moguls. The vanishing powers of an individual silenced. Protests, but hypermass = dumber² . A mirage of sheep following, being fooled into a scary mass of marketing strategies and promotional gimmicks. The pop culture: don’t take away our MTV, our Happy Meals, and our mainstream bullshit and hand us independence. Don’t silent us with banning, and censorship, and communism. Thrive in this conforming, cookie cut-out Britney Spears / Hugh Heffner wannabes. So says the different that ends up being the punk that falls into a category anyway. A stereotype.  Ahh..see this is what happens when you stick racheal into a mass-media class that debates four thousand and six conspiracies where every damn secret government agent is against us and everything we are being fed is programmed. Encrypted into a code somewhere, dictated by an unknown source. Watching the Beautiful Mind and finding more ways on how the KGB and the CIA is against me, more chips, more androids, more sheep.  Damn sheep.  Dr Schuler offered Italy/Switzerland to me today. History Honors program, ladies and gentlemen, that would be your biggest farce ever. The coolest stunt I would have ever pulled. English Honors, I understand. Math Honors, I still understand. Thespian Academy, doh. But history? Holy shit fuck I am whinging it!   So this summer I get to go to Italy. The selected few, it’s the Cambridge program or the Italy shit. Ahh, what sweet nectar I am sucking from. Parading in.   This is huge and big and incredible at the same time. My passport into freedom and excellence and learning. Teaching, growing, developing. What my heart sets out to do, my mind will get. Every other aspect is perfect, everything on the surface is polished and gleaming.    All that glitters is not gold    I feel stifled and oppressed. Pushing my limits, and striving to be everything I am not.   I don’t know how to justify this, or that. I speak with my head up my ass, I am amazed at this opportunity. Stunned even. But it is expected, make the cut, get the grade, live the life.  What if I’m not enough?  What if I’m not perfect, and not smart enough and I can’t explain Plato’s symposium and to the damn fuck don’t know much about Medea. What if who I am that you think I am is not at all?  What if I just question too much?  What if I should just go home and celebrate my  sorry  fat ass and continue memorizing my two bit monologues for my two bit auditions that I two bit avoid anyway? My silly bimbo mentality. What if some night when I’m asleep some fairy will fly it’s wings over me and wave it’s magic wand of confidence and security?  The dreaded what ifs again.  I am who I am. Live with it right?  Be proud of who you are, what you have achieved, who you can be.  I made the cut, Mom. I’m on the honor roll, I have a crazy crowd of friends, and I am almost but undeniably satisfied.  But I want more. So I push further and further, and test my limits, and set new goals.  So I try again and if I fall, damn bloody work harder at it.  Then why, I ask, am I not enough?  My poison, he says. It’s all your own doing. What makes you breaks you.  Understandable.    urlLink  "The Muse "needs her excitement, and drama, and craziness." - Yeah, right. All you need is a couple of 'C' sized batteries for your vibrator.

      I sent a part of my soul to the Technology Doctor today. I feel as if a part of me is missing, as if I have given away the intricate core of my being that pieces my life together. I figured, what’s a few days without writing, blogging, photographing, editing, imaging, emailing, surfing, and talking. Ah, you see, it is a huge part of me, it’s sad, I do admit, I’m a huge nerd.   So you see, I am curled up on the sofa with a borrowed laptop, rummaging through volumes and volumes of some sort of off-beat trance type British bullshit sorry excuse for music which in my humble opinion, is an unfair judgement of the type of sounds that come from the other part of the continent but what can I say, I have weird friends.  I am sitting here, sharing a cigarette with legs propped up with the intoxicatingly orgasmic scent of coffee parading around the room, seeping into his futon, getting underneath the covers with us. Getting my foot massaged and dinner prepared…thinking hey, maybe being a woman once a month isn’t too bad after all.  Nevermind the cramps, and the moodiness. Nevermind the strong desire to punch someone in the face and the sudden urge to wail my sorry ass off. I smell dinner, and damn it is good. But then again, that strategy of starving so anything tastes good always works.  I laugh because it feels like we are an old married couple though really, nothing about us is conventional. Perhaps lets start with the beginning, how the hell I managed to come home with a guy instead of a girl from the gay bar, don’t ask me.   I remember a part of this a long time ago, okay, maybe just two or three months. When He was still around, that comfortable “Honey, I’m at Wal-mart, do you need milk?”, but then as always, comfortable is never good enough for me. Racheal needs her excitement, and drama, and craziness. Racheal needs her volatile screaming and bitching and yelling. This is the part I see my mother shaking her head, whispering under her breath, racheal, racheal, racheal. All together now…  Siiiigggggghhhhhhh.  Oh wait, I forgot my point.  Er..yeah, Him was it? Well, really, there’s nothing much left to analyze there. There’s the ex, there’s pushing him back to his ex, and there’s excuses. The master of conspiracies and planning is at her best again, I still get my daily calls, my emails and updates, and I am happy for him. His life is balanced, and perhaps that’s what I need too….balance.  The friend of a friend of a friend’s place is typical. Clean even. Lots of black, white and silver here, abstract art there, Lucy Liu (yes, I’d fuck her too) poster tacked up  and the modern versus eastern vibe going around. Yes racheal, smart move, guy number seven with asian fetish. Hmph.   So maybe we’ll have sex tonight. Shit, I thought my gay-dar was pretty accurate but apparently, I am wrong. I take that back though…absolutely not, stupid thought dummy, I am staying celibate remember?  Stop laughing Marc.  I am attracted to a nice mix of humans right now. Just the right breed too, Men. * Gasp *   note sarcasm.   And I have absolutely forgotten my point of this entry, except maybe to say, I wimped out on Gayle today and rescheduled for Thursday again. Somehow, all the talking and explaining and feeling guilty didn’t sound like such a great idea today. Besides, how else was I going to knock this one down and fuck the human race again?  Oh well, there’s always tomorrow. New day, new idiot to diss, new morning to bitch.  Oh Wee.     urlLink  "I forget where I'm going with this."

      I used to be a writer…an artist. I used to sit and type for hours and hours, reliving tales and baring my soul. I was less cynical then, more opinionated then worried about being exposed. Art was my means of expression and so daily, I wrote in thoughts and opinions, daily, my feelings were transcribed into words, my moods captured in slides and the very  core of my being dictated my strides. My strokes. The beauty of heavy, wet paint brushed onto a white, clean canvas.   Free to be explored and altered, free to be manipulated and created. Free to do anything for everything was in my hands.   I was nimble and open, but years passed by and made me older. More cynical. Less forgiving. The shitless porcelain vase that stands broken thinly held together by only a film of adhesive...I am that vase that borders on insecurity. Will I fall and break and like Humpty-Dumpty not be able to put the pieces back together? Or will I waver between both sides and always be saved right before? Right before I crash and burn and fall like China cups on cold, wet, tiled floor…guaranteed them smithereens.  Stroke me.   Very gently, rub my back. Touch me. Get inside of me.  Make sweet, hard, soft, passionate love to me.   Don’t touch me.     urlLink  "There i sat, bleeding thumb held back away from my hand in an attempt to forget that it was conveniently opposable, pressing together the clay i had just so painstakingly cut apart."

      I feel like the dirty slut, with her long overdrawn secret rendezvous, down and tired with  everything. Noticing all the loopholes, changes, insecurity, seeing with that damn naked eye again.  Some part knows I have unleashed a whole new world to you…one that will undoubtedly bring you much pleasure and pain. This secret hideaway from the rest of the world that feels so good and so bad at the same time…you’ll understand a little bit more now; this perverse pleasure of hiding, of having the world in your hands, of that control, that desire, that ability to say anything you want and whatever you please and not give a rats ass about it.   How people can judge you here but really, do you care?  Some day I’ll grow old, tired, and weary. Some day my skin will wrinkle, and my eyes will lose it’s sparkle…that some day looms near. That some day is here and so far away…I have my days. All the wonders of being a woman they say, all the wonders of pms.  I play with that fucking heater control knob in my little room with nothing of my own and everything of my own at the same time. Always about the two tones, the two faces, the double lives.  I walk around naked, in my own skin around this room, I am secure. Cold, but secure. Avoid the mirrors I tell my goddamn self, don’t abuse yourself tonight, go out have yourself a shitless amazing crazy night.   I put on my little black dress and slowly, apply my layers. Concealer, foundation, powder, shimmer, blusher, eyeshadow, mascara, bronzer, lipstick. Holy shit it takes a lot to make me presentable.  I want to stun tonight. I want to step out and have him take a step back and say wow. I want him to think, holy damn shit hell, what did I do to deserve this? I want him to spend the whole night looking at me, wanting me, captivating me. And I know he will.  It is that power thing again. That control I crave. And I can act coy, and silly, and laugh. And I can play along into his fantasy of everything I am not, as if this outside racheal that people so damn like is truly so damn amazing.   Hah.  Oh well, and so I’ll have myself another night of pure lust and seduction. Of getting to know someone then come home and analyze all the reasons why this wouldn’t work. I don’t eat Starbursts anymore, I don’t take wine with my sushi, or listen to the ba-da-boop beats of my heart. They lie, I’ve learnt. Don’t fall this time, don’t fall again.  So then I live in my little world of the in between. Of craving for love but not wanting it at the same time. Of feeling the empty loneliness that comes with just choosing your own poison, of choosing this fate and running to a self-proclaimed destiny. I have fun when I need it but hard-earned lessons have taught me, don’t put out, don’t give out, don’t let go.  I am my own being. I am not enough on my own but I am all I have.    urlLink "Well, shit. These kids think I'm some kind of polymath. Like I know it all.

      Paper entries penned in daily- anger driven thoughts layered with putrid heartless emotions, tears that smudge the black ink and causes streaks to run along the smooth, crisp, surface of an intricately bound sixty-two dollars Hobby Lobby/Barnes & Noble put together journal.  Coffee sits on the old oak table, getting colder by the minute…second. Getting stale, obsessive nights of Starbucks and Salem lights, heavy crystal ashtray emptied daily. Daily, the trash is taken out.   Scattered albums of childhood pictures lay around the floor, picture cds of ranging emotions that lie deep within her, mindframes of different occasions captured on camera. She thinks she’s almost invisible, her the subject though escape the reality.  Overexposed shots in a row. The naked eye does not see all that lies within it’s context. The series of bright, stark, harsh light washing her out remains to be her favorite. Transgressed, perhaps that is how she feels.   Soul, torn up and bleeding. She is breathing again, beating…but nightly, she draws back to nestle into this cocoon of security she used to know, how do you break the cycle? How do you stop all these emotions and thoughts?  Her brand new angel wraps herself around her broken wings, begs her to wave her magic wand and make it all disappear. Her hundred dollar an hour therapist is where she goes to search for more answers, ask more questions.  But nightly, she still gets sick. Nightly, when the world stops watching, she cries.   It hurts. It hurts to be so wanted  but feel so empty. It hurts to lock yourself away into a tiny little cell in your mind, it just gets so damn cold. So damn alone.  Yes, she does want to feel love, wants to love, wants to need. Yes, the opportunities are presented, are argued. But she doesn’t understand why, but she is afraid how…afraid of her own being, her own doings. Afraid of the person she is, afraid of the person that begs her back in the mirror.  She ruined herself way before he ruined her and all these ruining has left her with scars. Scars that control her actions and dictate her feelings.  There are too many extremes in living her life, apparently, her indecision, her fears, her sensitivity is what makes her her. Makes her desirable, makes her beautiful, makes her loved.  She doesn’t understand. Not one solitary bit at all.

      I am in one of those moods where I am so talked out and tired, I almost have no more bitches and frustrations in me to rant about. Notice the all important Almost.  The trips, to say the very least, was quite eventful. I really should probably just stop at that but seeing as I feel a strong desire to press on with this need to analyze things, I will talk about it.  So I figured out a lot of things, hell, you think that with the last whole week my damn mind would have at least been in overdrive already.   But Nooo, coming home I decide that on a four hour drive with a dog, sex talk and no music because I brilliantly destroyed the CD player on the way there, we would talk about feelings, and emotions, and bullshit about relationships. Now what started that spiel, I don’t know completely.  I am swerving in between lanes, attempting to get used to the car and having long overdrawn protests on why I stand for the things I do or at the very least, attempting to reclaim what little dignity I have left when it dawns on me to just god damn shut up and keep my opinions to myself.  It’s like one of those things where people talk and talk and talk all the while; judge and judge and judge.   To a certain point, it almost reaches unbearable.  Never, ever, have I been so glad to cross the Pensacola Bay. Or that retarded street along Pine Forest that says N.A.S. oh, god forbid do I ever curse that sign again.  But anyway, it is that tension so thick it is silent that permeates in the air, all laughter from the night before is now destroyed with the difference of opinions and judgements. I hate that I am affected by it, I hate that the whole damn car is suddenly full of drama and tension it is like a bad run of The Bold & Beautiful with fake smiles and pats to go all around.  I feel as if any minute now, some cheesy theme song is going to burst out. And it does, in different forms, just make it through the next twenty minutes and you’ll be right.  I ring and say, I’ll be home soon, take me for a drive. Take me away. Calm me down.   I finally reach and it’s that damn dam again and all the pent up, bottled shit just spurts out forcefully. It is painful and mortifying all at once, it is embarrassing.  We drive for a while, and I need someone to say the things I know I need to hear tonight. they are said, and two hours of driving around one side of the town to the other later, I am sane again.  We reach and go in for dinner. Diner smoke-free and harsh bright lights, fading into a corner…I eat. I am smiling again…laughing. Comfortable.   At peace.  I might think too much, so sue me.

      Cubicles intrigue me.  Think about it, you know, how psychology is all about analyzing the human mind and how people project certain things…or rather how people take your basic functions and put them into context about who you are as a person?  Like which row you choose, the left aisle? The fourth computer in the middle? Do you like your chair higher, lower….how everything is nothing as it seems.  How, apparently, if you cross your legs a certain way it decides who you like better? Acting is so interesting, how you study your characters and decide how it’s suppose to live or function or walk. Talk.   I don’t know, it suddenly just came to me. I’m easily amused…so go out, pick your seats, play up your idiosyncracies and somehow, human evolution spines through and we all end up having the same thoughts. Doing the same things.   Damn sheep.  So what separates you from one being to the other? Are they your values? Your opinions? The way you view the world or the god you believe in?  I honestly to the damn fuck don’t know.  I also curse too much.  But yeah, just food for thought…or in this case, thought for the next four hours.

       “We will not talk about anything that will make you feel uncomfortable,”   but then I ask her, taunt her to hurt me…ask me…push me into a corner and weep. I know what I do is not right, I know my decisions at times are bad and really terrible. I want that feeling, that muck with being who I am to be realized. I want to go in and feel guilty, I want to do whatever it takes….whatever the god damn hell it takes to be sane.  I talk and it feels like this big great dam in me has been unleashed, all the pressure of trying to stay on top…of having to be on top. I talk and talk and talk, I talk till my voice is hoarse and throat is dry, cry out. Then I turn around and realize I haven’t done that at all, I’ve hidden yet again, I’ve continued this act of being strong and have ironically, come out strong.  Stupid, lying bitch.  Psychologist. There’s such an eerie ring to that, the social stigma; mental health benefits.   “I am seeing someone,”  Instantly, you assume it is of a romantic nature, free sex for all and lots of romance. After all, that’s what I do best innit? Play the games, work the circuit, get my entertainment. I make it seem as if we are all pawns in a match, as if it is just a challenge. Hook, line, and sinker.  But I don’t mean that. I mean seeing someone to get help. Get better. Work on things and get through stuff. Icky, icky stuff.   I hate this seeking for help part. I am uncomfortable with admitting it, I am a damn conformist. I too believe that psychologists are for really really bad people, crazy people. People that kill their parents and drown their kids…I’m not one of them am I?  But then again. I am bad, I do bad things, do evil, nasty things to myself, to people, to anyone that comes close. I am bad.   Punish me.   Hurt me.  And when all is over, forgive me.  Is there a god? Am I on my way to meet him? is there some immense, eternal being at the pearly gates…..is there such a thing as the pearly gates?  i….don’t know.   I hate knowledge.  Fuck you Eve, again.   urlLink  Maybe it’s time to re-prioritize things in life again. What is it to feel love and not feel loved? Hurt. Emptiness. Void. But life continues, right or wrong. Things that weren’t given priority will surface in my life again. Design. Books. Friends. Life. So many things have happened, but none without a good reason. Ah, one of life’s greatest mysteries. To soar high and fall back to the ground and to renew the faith. Afterall, what’s the hurt if not joy?

      No sunlight pierces through, only the sharp stinging ice drops falling. It is bleak and somber, slow…as if almost melodramatic surrealness. I’d like to believe the world stopped turning a while, took a break too…teardrops from heaven they say; why is god crying?   “God because you look at everything and still smile,”   Surprisingly very sober now, flashes of last night makes breaks her into a smile. Their little rendezvous into forbidden land, rolls of raw fish consumed washed away with laughter and good company. Twirling around, she is dancing.  She feels good and bad at the same time, the cold doesn’t help. Her bones ache as she shivers, curls up closer to the fireplace but it’s okay, she reminds herself. As always, things will be right.  All these people coming and going in her life; bad pick up lines that make her giggle and charm that makes her blush. It’s interesting to see how the animals devour their meat, fend off allies that become equal predators….basic human instinct. Fight.  But she sits at the sidelines and observes. Poor silly things, she’s not looking; does that mean she’s leading them on? No, she’s been quite clear about it, she remembers, yet some part of her can’t help but wonder why his hands finds hers as she jokingly yanks it away and wags her finger.   Cock teaser.     It’s Thursday.  …and I know that apprehension. That anxious feeling that makes you want to run.              Especially when everyone who “knows” says you have to do what you don’t do. And you know you don’t – so why don’t they know you know?  ‘Cause sometimes what we know – we don’t.  It’s just talking.              Blogging out loud.  To a stranger’s face that, let’s face it – you might never see again anyway.  Don’t be too smart. (You are sometimes – and you know that.) Too smart “for your own good” – whatever the fuck that is.  It’s just talking.  So talk. You dazzle when you talk. You impress without pressing too hard.  By the time you leave…they’ll know why you’re so confused sometimes.  (Laugh as you drive away…now it’s their problem!)  Love you      you remembered;  .....thank you.      urlLink "The most seemingly difficult decisions to make are actually quite easy.

       “A desire for control and to avoid responsibility for growing up.”   This is an irrational world. This earth, these expectations and these beings are harsh…tormenting. Voices in my head, that sounds so damn psychologically sick but damn voices in my head.  I think I have it all figured out, this game of life we play. Checkmate. You lose, I win, the devil says.  I’ve been feeling shitty the last few nights, the prognosis has been getting better and better but I feel weaker and weaker. I don’t know if I am physically tired because of the illness or if I am depressed, in any case though, I skipped out on auditions last night. I figure, I’ll just pay for the consequences later…  But later is today, when I think about all that’s going right in my life and how damn insecure I feel about it. Scrubbing this harsh muck of dirty grime off and not quite very sure of what lies beneath, wanting to take control but unsure of where I’m suppose to head.   I am coming out and feeling good and being happy but all these emotions and feelings scare the bejesus out of me. It draws back to that question of whether I am enough, and when there is nothing else externally to blame, if I can accept who I am as a person and if that person makes me good or not. Enough or not. Secure or not.   I am so damn fucking irritated with myself. Angry with myself for questioning and being unhappy with myself. It’s a chicken or an egg thing. The more icky I feel, the worst physically I am, and the worst physically I am, the more icky I feel.  Some days I want to go against all that I’ve been fighting for and say, just drug me. Just make me better, just take this shit away. But then it takes away everything and fucks up all the effort and time I have spent going against it. Maybe, sometimes, we all just reach a stage where we learn to question?  Damn Eve for eating the forbidden fruit. Damn Pandora for opening the box. Damn the gods for feelings, and growing up, and salvation.  I realize every time I reach a stage where things are going exceptionally good I fall. Or breakdown. When everyone pats you on the back and says wow, and people around you make you feel so important; you feel the opposite.  Stupid damn thoughts.  Stupid damn questioning.  Stupid damn mind.    urlLink "blah. icky mondays."

      I accomplished a lot of things today.  Yet in some sense, I did absolutely nothing for me as a person at all.  I read, and continued reading, even as the pain ripped through my heart, the remnants of it anyway. I don’t know how love went so wrong, or how something that seemed so right and perfect could have been fucked up so bad. And the only answer that remains is that it was all my doing. My bad. My fault. As always, my desire to make things right messed things up further.  I opted for no treatment. I didn’t realize the symptoms would come so fast, so hard. Maybe I’m rethinking my decision, wondering if this is truly right.  I honestly do not know what I want, it feels as if it gets more and more confusing by the day. I am physically so worn out my mind is tired too.  I read, felt. You know how you watch certain movies and feel the protagonist/antagonist pain and understand all that shit that runs through. It felt worst to have understood rather than the guilty pleasure of being secure. Or right.  I watched at how he tore apart me as a person…and question who I was. Who am I anyway? Is everything he says true? I watched how he mocked my relationship, our relationship, how it seemed so easy for him to talk about being raped, getting sick, being left.   As if each nail he picked up only drove straight to the right point. It hurt. I hate that it does, I am strong enough for this damnit. I am okay.  You don’t need him. you don’t want him. you cannot love him anymore. He’s not the one, no one is. You’re not enough.   Maybe some day he’ll find out…and maybe some day he’ll know. understand. Will it be too late then?  Probably.  Why am I here again? Why is he so unreachable…untouchable? I just feel so not there as a person right now, my chest hurts like a damn fuck and my ten pound chicken sits securely on it. It is frustrating because I know it would be easy to fix this immediate problem but I’ve done this alone before…I don’t want to do it again. It’s ironic how he has become my steve. Raped, left, broken, begging again.  I’m tired of begging, of explaining. He didn’t care, he won’t care anymore. So maybe he will always love me, but maybe he just loved the racheal that was never racheal with him. that maybe the only racheal anyone will ever love is the thin, secure, happy, healthy racheal. Maybe she’s the only one that deserves love. I seriously thought I was leaving last week. I went skiing instead, went to go continue dreaming, relax. And I came back so fired up, so ready to go, so complete…but I am a complete absolute mess tonight. Crying and hurting, throwing up more times than I care to remember, feeling so nothing and bad about myself…it’s so wrong.   I know I am a someone. I know I have hope and I’m beautiful and I’m strong. I just wish that he saw that too, that he’d say I see you for who you are and you don’t have to pretend anymore, I accept you.  Funny isn’t it how the one person you want is the one person you can’t have? Is the one person that you should probably stay away from.   It feels as if there is so much riding on me as an image. The person on the outside, nothing bad ever happened when I was pretending. Having problems doesn’t justify cheating on your boyfriend, I perfectly finely understand that…but I’m just fucked up and I don’t know how to fix me anymore. I don’t feel strong enough or good enough for this.  Part of me just wants it all to be over. Take me and be done with it. Throw me into the fiery pierces of hell or whatever, I don’t care. I’m done.  Why the fuck do I have to question that?  Fuck you cancer.    ”and nobody will ever know. i'm good at keeping up appearances, don't you know? just like a clockwork orange.”

       urlLink  "She gave her flesh. She gave her heart. She gave her soul.  And in return, She was left with nothing but the memories. The bruises. The nightmares. The scars.  Discarded. Left to hang helplessly from the rafters within the dark recesses of her mind. Once more discarded into the black, forcing the familiar journey back to the light."    Two points for determining my factor of existence tonight. It’s been a long week; one of those where your days and nights are strung together and your basic necessity of staying alive is coffee and endurance. Classes filled to the brim with people, anonymity comforting, nothing to touch bases at the end of the day. Reflection in the mirror ugly to the eyes, analytical mind criticizes, tear apart my being. Highs and lows from the environment around.  It’s been a good week though; parties, friends, people, dates, school, stepping out, being safe. I’ve had the security of people around me the last few days, backing me up, the strong arches that rectify my sometimes not so very solid foundation. It is nice to feel like I’m wanted sometimes. It is nice to feel wanted.  My appointment is this Thursday. I am scared and excited; it feels as if my life is finally going somewhere but at the same time, I am kinda displaced and thrown off about this whole new world I am heading into. It is hard to stay calm and focused when daggers penetrate deep into the skin from every angle and turn. It is even harder sometimes, to just stay alive.  Beautiful things are being weaved into my life though, little miracles that almost make everything okay. I keep on reminding myself to not fall in love, as if it is up to me. I will not put myself into a position of having to need someone again. It’s terribly selfish I know, but I need to be strong for me now….need to do this for me.   We’re all moving on and stepping into the new year. Finally grabbing hold of these reins to take charge, I will not make this another wasted, unaccomplished, pointless year. The initial surreal wonder of having slipped into another year has faded, all that’s left with resolutions is fixing. Living.  I like all these new people around me. Some perverse part of me enjoys being told I’m beautiful, enjoys being taken out and feeling like the most important diamond in the world. Maybe it’s the little crazy part in me that has fun dressing up and giggling like a little school girl, blushing profusely when complimented and feeling good. Is it pride? Is it reassurance? Or is it just human nature to like being chased after? Liked.  It is confusing to the naked mind why I would choose getting mentally better over physically better. Why not do both? Why not fix both? Is it a mind over matter thing or is this just another one of my not so great decisions? I’d be lying if I told you that I knew the exact reasons why, it just feels right I guess.  Beggars can’t be choosers.   urlLink  "if you're reading this, don't reply. because, not only will you have ruined my long-standing perception of friendship, you will have also ruined my rant."

      You tell me I’m oblivious to beauty…that my four walls of security has confined me. And I blush, stumble over explanations and words, hell bloody shit why am I shy now?   Things are changing in my life, things I cannot predict nor really visualize. At times, it feels as if I am falling and leading myself into bigger trouble, slapping myself in the face with more warts and wounds to cloud my judgment. I am my own being, whatever my decisions, determine the outcome; all my actions are of my own right and doing. I cannot put the blame on others anymore, I must take responsibility….but damn, that is a big load.  I am equipped with different gifts. Talents they say. But many times I have felt as if it was all just a show, a façade, because many times I have failed. My grades come from hard work and the shows honed from countless hours of practice…precision even. It does not come easy, the different languages a barrier…translation goes on in my mind…I feel retarded. Disabled almost.  But I am not. I am whole in being and breathing. Heart beating and life living. I am here and my moments are being executed and made, every second of my life is being recorded in some book above…will I live my life without regrets?  I am a person. I am a being with feelings and emotions…perhaps even at times, way too much sensitivity points. I am person that can be beautiful, can be something, can be someone. Sometimes I want to say I just need you or someone to believe in me, and I catch myself constantly evaluating the people around me, not realizing that all the insecurity lies within. I make my own person, it is me that needs to believe in me and me that needs to know that I can do it. That I am someone to somebody and have so much more ahead of me. Is life gorgeously enthralled in ecstacy? Hell no. but it is quite damn close to at times…the times that I  believe.   urlLink  "I've never been this happy about someone proving me wrong.

      So I’d really like to tell you that I had wild, explicit, back-to-back cosmic orgasm sex last night…but no.   Hehe, instead we went dancing, listened to some bands play, had brilliant conversation, laughed and had a good time. Tadahhh!  And so it’s one down, two more to go…I can’t stop giggling..it’s retarded really. I feel like a million bucks right now, I guess what they say is true; confidence does attract the masses.  Ah well, too bad I’m not one hundred percent interested, or rather i'm in that limbo of just enjoying the company not looking for a relationship stand thing…though it does allow leeway for some fun then eh?  SLUT!!!  :P    urlLink friday five  blatantly stolen from  urlLink jasmine :    1. Do you wear any jewelry? What kind?  yup…mostly silver or artsy shitty weird things I pick up..i don’t know. it really just depends on the mood and whatever I’m wearing….though I’m also the idiot with purple straps and a hot pink shirt on right now so maybe I should just shut it eh?    2. How often do you wear it?   quite often actually though lately I have been obsessively wearing these gorgeous silver hoop thingamabobs besides the usual hoohaa of rings and bracelets…I like to make noise :P   3. Do you have any piercings? If so, where?  eight piercings..you go figure.   4. Do you have any tattoos? If so, where?  no :( and damn fucking pathetic too! I’d really like a butterfly at the base of my spine but it’s been known to hurt like a bitch plus the current social stigma of every other tom, dick, harry and their mothers having a tattoo. Oh well.   5. What are your plans for the weekend?  I have a date tommorow night…(Whoop! Whoop!) with some guy that I’ve sorta been talking to for the last few months…in fact, come to think about it, he was one of the first people I met but then because I’m such and dork and he’s shy and we never got our shit together…it’s taken us this long. Yes, retarded, I know. but then like I said earlier, it’s funny how it works either that you’re instantly attracted but shy as fuck or it grows on you. So anyway, there’s that, swing dancing tonight, and maybe, if the cast can coordinate their schedules together, a movie on Sunday! Oh, and if you get me drunk enough maybe even some studying.   Right.

      Ah…isn’t it nice to just hang out and fervently discuss your sex life with the ex?  :)  hmm..so I  canceled  rescheduled the appointment with Gayle. Why? I don’t know really… just felt like it  :P   nah…for real though, I seem to have this little problem of taking on too much at one time and this would be a very good example.  In this week, I’ve had to unpack, get settled in again, explain myself, get my ass out of the hot seat, start school again, schedule my classes, get the right books and find the right classes, figure out how things work out and all that good stuff. To sugar coat things in a nice way, I wanted the experience of getting better to be an experience of it’s own rather than a hodge podge mix of everything else and between.    I wrote this quite very poignant and emotional eulogy last night for Brian. In my drunk stupor and rocked out good self, I had captured all these emotions I had inside and somehow I lost that post. I’ve had a few days to sorta think about it now and I know he’s in a better place. Heaven’s gained another angel and maybe he’ll rest in peace now…  The whole saga with getting sick again is still around somewhere. Maybe just not quite as dramatic as it was before this. Once again, something else that I can’t explain…giving it up to fate or god or whatever really. Reality check today was watching the insurance rocket up just a little higher and taking the smug smile off the bitch from hell needle stabbers face.  So school started today…to say it was a good one would be an understatement. It was nice to walk the halls, pass friends by and be stimulated mentally again. I have sixteen credits again this term and maybe with the shadow box production whether it’s set design or actual acting, there’ll be an extra one. I am in no hurry to graduate but it feels good to be productive and moving somewhere. Aiming for something at least.  We arranged it so I only needed to be in school on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays as opposed to being there every damn day for too many damn hours in between like last term. It’s pretty much basically back to back from eight till half past one in the afternoons. And note to my stupid self, it is not a smart idea to go out the night before and have to wake my sorry head pounding ass at six in the morning.  I do have some pretty exceptional lecturers though. Much thanks to the beautiful people that get my back…ahh…it is pretty darn nice to feel special. I have the head of the history department teaching me classical mythology. Professor Hagedorn for comp 2, head of the communications department for survey of mass comm. plus even the same director for college publication. Then there’s mr dean, the director of the musical, for acting 2 and Washington for algebra. My classes are pretty much packed to the brim with people but it’s interesting….:) I am excited and love this feeling of having something to look forward too. Remind me again though when I’m up my ass in homework and reading, five out of my six classes have comprehensive reading and writing…ah…what great fun.  Hmm..it’s strange but I feel loved today. And shit yeah it’s a good feeling.  Bite me!  I love you

         About two weeks ago I met an amazing person.   His name was Brian. He was funny and kind and one of the first things I ever remembered him telling me was to not give up.  See Brian knew my battle, and my fears. Somehow, through emails, I had found someone just like me…quite lost and confused but supported. We talked about how it wasn’t easy, that good wishes only brought you so damn far and that when you were puking your guts out and staring your sorry sick disabled body in the mirror…it only remained so.  That very week, darrell, his twin brother, emailed me…telling me that even if I felt that I was losing to remember all that I said to him when I first posted. I had written this long overdrawn entry on how hypocritical I felt and how hopeless and pointless it all seemed to be back here again. My prayers seemed fervent but yet, reading that and thinking about how someone I did not know at all and someone I hadn’t even met was telling me to press on and not give up, touched me.  A week ago I wrote them saying that I had had enough of this shit. That I was ready to die and give up. I wrote and begged, asking for some merciless soul out there to shoot me, perhaps even kill me. They were posts on a forgotten teenage journal with angst and fury to boot. I was crying out and breaking down.   The last whole week has just been breathtaking. I built again, dreams I had thrown away and found courage, strength and peace. This is seems so awfully cliqued but it’s been one of those weeks where you’re going and going, running and running, and you really have absolutely no shit idea where you’re going or what you are doing and you finally realize all the things you truly want and how badly you will go to get it.  I wrote last night, summary of all that has happened in small, stoic posts. I had chosen to be away from everything, disconnected. Coming in last night I had thirty-seven emails, fifteen messages and a dozen people to talk to. News spread around, the bitch was back in town ready to kick some ass and start again, I had boxes and boxes to unpack and a thousand and six things to do on my list. As always I was too busy, too preoccupied with pointless shit and too caught up with my drama, and my life, and my shit.  I found out today heaven gained another angel on new years. My last words to him was new year, new resolution, new hope. He didn’t make it past midnight of December the thirty-first. I am…I don’t know what I am right now or how I make of it.  Shocked is a good place to begin.  I don’t know how he crashed so fast and so hard.  A week ago we were talking about remission and biopsies. Of going home and the holidays. Merry fucking Christmas right?   Life really is that fucking short.   This is so surreal. I want to scream and shout…maybe even cry. But my feelings aren’t coordinated enough to make sense of everything right now. Fight harder or give up? Is this how you would feel too if I didn’t make it? It’s just unfair right now. How? Why? What? Who? When?  Zplaid1, you will remain in my heart forever.  For the person that fought/pressed on to the end, I wish you peace.  Thank you.   ....sorry you were robbed.

      Ten states.  Eight and a half days.  Two years.  No connection.  One conclusion.  Apparently, Wednesday I go in to see Gayle. I’ve been thinking a lot about it, what I want, who I can be, what I want to be…where I’m going, you know, all that horse bull crap you get with the end of a somewhat indefinable year and the beginning of something else not quite understood yet.  I wondered if this would be the very last time I said this, that I was a better, bigger, stronger, incredible human being. That I was, among everything else, quite possibly beautiful. And some days, I believe it, some days, my head is stuck so far up my ass that I walk the walk and talk the talk. I am gorgeous, and thin, intelligent and charming. I am distractingly amazing and I am absolutely everything you want.   But nobody has, has me. Perhaps even as far as to say, nobody can get me.   It started a little like this, I begin to say, explain everything that has happened in the last seven days. Hell, even trying to put the last twenty four hours into perspective is hard…and you want me to do the whole damn week?  Maybe my little heart told my little brain that it was dying. And maybe my little mind told my little body to just give up. And so I did. I gave up, packed, lost it for a good couple of hours and then came home. Or ‘home’?  Ridiculous.  Stupid.  Insane.  Fuck waste of money.  In the last few days, I have seen mountains and ridges, snow and sunshine, land and air, people and faces. But the best discovery was finding a place in me to lock away and cry. Yes, cry.  Cry because I am nothing like the person I want to be. cry because I keep on letting the ones close to me go, cry because I want them to come back but I know now that I can’t have them do that. cry because I know that despite how dirty, ugly and tainted I get, that I still deserve love. And love is what makes me worth it. Love makes hope. And I have Love.  Skiing and sledding. Climbing and tracking. Driving and horse back riding. And I learnt about trailers honking and blowing soapy liquid bubbles. Rainbows after the rain, snowmen (sometimes women) and angels from heaven.  He asked me where angels came from. I said deep within. And so he ran to mommy and said nana was made in heaven. I rubbed his boo-boos when his three year old uncoordinated knees scraped the ground, and he fell asleep to lullabies that I sang him, wanting to protect him from growing up, from wanting to find out who he was and where his place was in the world.  Scares. Getting knocked up. Breaking up. Running away. Getting sick again. Doing so damn well and so damn horrible at the same time. Pushing, testing, accelerating.  I’ve been running on empty, and empty has been an understatement.  Growing bald in my slowly emaciating body, wheezing, it’s hard to breathe….abuse me further. I dare myself to.   ‘It’ is under control. Monitored. Whatever the fuck that means really…but if it means more time here than hey, that’s good…right?   I promise to take care of myself. To quit smoking. To eat properly. To fight the best I can. To go in when I have to and speak up when I need to….but do you think that’s easy?  And nobody said it was easy. And nobody said I’m not going to come back some night tired, sick and alone. But nobody also said that it was impossible.  Maybe as long as there is still all a hundred and five pounds of Chinese shit mass of me then I might still make it.   Nobody said I couldn’t try.  And nobody should ever make me feel the shitty way I do again.  But the question is, it isn’t them, or him, or they, or her.  It is the being in me that gives up, breaks down and chops me into pieces. It is my doing that I am who I am.   Pray for whatever I want but the work needs to be done right?  Admit that I’m sick. Admit that I’m bulimic. Admit that I have problems. Admit that I can be pretty damn amazing. Admit everything and back, but a year ago I made the same promises, the same resolutions. A year from now…will it all still be the same?  Change doctors, change treatments, change prescriptions. Can I change bodies and minds too?  I don’t know. but I’m alive. And still living. And fight your god damn sorry self he says.   And fight my god damn sorry self I will.  I am beautiful goddamnit;  …fight you little fucker, fight.

      something about certain thursdays that breathe like sundays. the laziness...carefree nothingness that hangs lightly in the air. floating through as if just another breeze...simplicity at it's best.  a fresh pot of coffee made, utensils thrown around, overalls splattered with paint and hard-worked fingers dirty with paints and crayon specks. calligraphy tools and bottles and bottles of ink stacked across the shelves, old tattered t-shirts strewn around as rags used to soak up spills and wipe off clumsiness..broken glasses, pencil shavings, cloth pegs and superglued velvet used to explore different mediums.  camera recharged and solid prints lie scattered on her desk. strips and strips of photo paper cut-out fight for space against the other seven hundred and forty two projects she has lined up. disks with a hundreds of pictures scanned in for her latest endeavor, a personal challenge she's taken up on herself. she must be bored really. or just dumb.  just don't rub it in when she starts tearing her hair out frustrated and whining...  :P  the television hums in the background, more depressing news reports yet she keeps it locked on cnn, as if delibrately reminding her of the 'real world'. real things out of the space she resides in, out of the four corners of her own world. her selfishness and feelings about wants/needs/dreams/hopes falls shallowly among worldly matters.  someone is hungry.  someone is dying.  someone is homeless.  someone is fatherless.  motherless.  soldiers deployed.  terror reigns.  ...another debate on war. another point battled and fought over again. she slips on covers and sheds off layers. intellect battles, points that have to be made...some sort of agreement to be on the same page and yet his intelligence has only charted up more points.   she wonders what this means.  her heart rather skelteredly opens. tests waters.  she knows she enjoyed her. him. she enjoyed the craving sufficed. being held. loved. she enjoyed being close to someone again, physically satisfied, mentally complete, sexually recharged. she'd begun to think her libido had went into the non-existent, nothing attracted her and she had shut off contact, emotions and intimacy completely.  one by one she shot them down. never opening up. never giving in to the possibility...yet she realizes what a vast mistake that was. could she have slipped that person by? the one that would complete her and make her happy forever?  now as she realizes how amazing it feels to be needed. be loved. be close to someone. feels. she wonders..  nothing will shut up the voices but she's not too sure if she wants to shut them up anymore. the extra pounds in the mirror she sees? she (learns to) love them now.  a part of her.  so she'll be fat and loud and bitchy and opinionated and talk up and through her ass.  ...big fucking deal.  so what?  :)  hah.  ....renewed.    urlLink  "muse has a date....of the bubble gum kind."    heh.   :)

      i picked up a box of oil-based crayons today.  you know, the type with vivid colors that merge quite nicely together but leave your fingers greasy and speckly?  :)  wal*mart trips at two in morning after a waffle house session with everyone and their mothers is great. stupid, silly, retarded and definitely unproductive but there's a distinct feeling of pure utter joy in watching your friends pull up rather coincidentally and having made friends with the table next door that just so happens to be friends of a friend. it's a small world indeed.  as the old man pulls up a chair next to the giggling bobsy twins and escapades are rehashed and retold. colored brightly and painted into someone else's world, the jukebox slammed with quarter after quarter of late eighties gold her father taught her to listen to, country bumpkin crap she's learned to appreciate and a host of pop songs she's too embarrassed to buy cds of.  i just killed my streak of eight wins. i fell asleep.  yes, my literati ass crayoning at this obscene hour just dozed off lying on the floor with my fluffy soft pillow.  well, that sucks. but oh well.  i'll get over it.  :)  scattered around are 'expressions', they call it 'art', i call it boredom at five am and a fascination with colors.   inspired.  so i had this phone conversation today....  :P

      so i wouldn't exactly say that i was 'arbitally forced' into writing this post..  though 'coerced' might not be too bad a word at all...:P   urlLink  "Girl, you wear that outfit again, and we're gonna have to sell tickets just to walk down the hall behind you. There was more "backfield in motion" going on there than the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.  So, who is it?  DETAILS, girlfriend, DETAILS...  And I don't want any of that eye-rolling, tongue-clicking, breathy-sighing bullshit either.  Shut up, sit down, and let's talk.  What's his/her name?  (I love the idea that I can't even guess the gender with you, these days...Oh, yeah, you can fake this exclusive lesbian thing with the less-attentive, but I notice, sweetheart. I notice. Your front door is swinging both ways these days...I can tell.)  So out with it.  Those of us whose sexuality isn't threatened by you exploring yours want to know."    see...now how can anyone resist such shameless ass kissing and not revel in it?  :P  i did recieve a couple of interesting emails with regards to that silly post i put up this morning.  and just for the record, no, i've yet to sign the deal with showtime just in case you were wondering...but at the rate the spamming hits my mailbox, and should i decide to 'enlarge my breasts the safe and easy way' and lose all senses, you'll be the first to know.  :P  hm...i also reconsidered putting up the rant and good stuff people had to say because i figured why rub salt on the wound eh?  lol, too much typing anyway. and hell, i want to talk about  *me* !  it's about a quarter to three on thursday and i'm already into the next day. it's been one of those silly crazy retarded days. grins plastered and silly giggles to no one and everyone..it's nice. :)  went to go bug ryan at work then caught the three-dollar movie (complete with nachos, chips/fries/potato-things with about fifty gallons of ketchup and jalapenos that i swear are fighting against the butterflies in my tummy!) after church. yes, she went to church, again too at that! hehe, i even agreed to agonize our choir director with my majorly transposed version of 'requiem aeternam'. good shit i tell ya..  and ryan.  damn.  no, i mean dah-yum.  :)  in another realm completely though..the head doctor and i had a pleasant chat today. i actually feel good and strong. laughing and making jokes and taking cheap pisses at her lousy green sofas and lack of comfortable pastel colors in the room. brought in my paper journal and read out some recent entries...it's quite eye-opening what self-realization does to you. :P well, at least she's taken me off the treatment center list...baker acts are damned piss scary.  to be quite honest, i'm actually feeling rather mentally sane. it's strange, do you think it takes acceptance to reach this tranquility? or a busy schedule, bizarre budgetting techniques, scrabble games, and silly kooky loving friends to do that? i don't know...but whatever it was, it apparently worked!  yay for mental health care.  :P  hm..i have to go in and settle out the transition/moving documents with the university tomorrow and start looking for a place + all that good bullshit. i can't wait for my mom to come!  i don't even care about the hospitals or sticks and needles anymore. i just miss her...i miss having a mom around. or a dad too. and i figure it would be so nice to just sit and talk over a warm soothing cup of tea even if it rains outside but to feel the sunshine from within. i've really learned/matured a lot in these last six months about life and my crazy silly self but moving so far away will do that i suppose.  some part of me is afraid of losing a part of me that's slowly being left behind but i know i'll be alright...and things are genuinely okay. love is always such a beautiful feeling and love heals.   it's funny how it takes loving you through the rain to realize how capable or worth of love you are. i am.  and i am.  stronger, slightly older, slightly wiser but nonetheless, better.  :)  it's been a good day...  two points!

      smart ass.  that's all i'm going to say because it's a good day today.  *sniggers*  /delete/  whoop. whoop.  there's something very wrong about finding this liberating. or right.  what do you say wrong reverend?  :P     "and racheal...well...i don't know if i can put a positive spin on that one. so instead i'll make a joke. in my life, i've never met someone who's sucked so bad at suicide. i shouldn't make jokes about that, but honestly. if you've tried to kill yourself as many times as she has, and you still haven't done it right, i think you need to find another hobby. i say starring in pornos would do her good. it's obvious she wants attention (as anyone who repeatedly "attempts" suicide does) without the permanence of death...and she apparently likes fucking random guys. that way she'd get attention and dick and money to boot. it's win win win for her."   show time video...here i come!

      i met someone tonight....by pure coincidence though i must say, it was quite nice.  i think i'm a little flushed. flabbergasted even.  it's that nervous shiver you get after a long kiss on the second date...that anticipation that sorta rumbles in your tummy as you try and keep yourself from squealing or giggling out loud. the excitement as you catch yourself smiling to no one from no where and just because.  it's a good feeling really.  if only it didn't involve conscious thoughts and primitive actions. if only it didn't involve a heart, a set of limbs and a mind multiplied by two.  i wish. i wish. i wish.  i should go to bed, perhaps not think this to death.  yeah fucking right.  and he respects me too.  good fucking god, what is this world coming to?  so i've waited for the beautiful ribbon stringed bow package to arrive..and apparently it has. i feel as if i should kick and throw it around to just make sure it's not going to explode on me then implore all it's horrid contents on to my now cleaned a step before faded jimmy choos.  we talk about bubblegum lesbians and he strips me off my sexuality. i explain how i enjoyed the brief fling exploring her body two days ago but it was extremely different. nice soft different but still nonetheless, different. and i crave for this closeness, this new found freedom. intimacy.   i tear my insecurities to pieces and laugh along with him as he rehashes anecdotes to politically correctly address his ex. i don't know why but there is a distinct feeling that i would have been more comfortable with this conversation had she had blonde hair, blue eyes and big huge boobs. no, instead she was japanese...and already my sirens are blaring. albeit young and perky, cute sexy thing la di da...i know this drill very damn hard.  i joke around and mask myself while unlayering so fucking well it's almost as if an undefined talent. he talks about writing and the people inside...and i shrug and just say, well shit happens. some part testing waters to see how much shitforbrains still means to me and i cower a little, attempting to rectify the mistake of letting him bring it up and want to just smile it off instead. forget the hurt that idiot has ever caused me because hell knows, i've did my fair share too. so i focus again on our conversation and smile a little, giggle even, as he rather noticingly stares in awe.  i skip, dance, twirl around. choke the butterflies in my tummy to death then grin again.  oh fuck me now.

      i curl into different positions...hoping at least to accidentally slip into one that might hopefully be comfortable.  watch, as silent sheep pass me by and the city sleeps, falls down into tranquility and wraps around.   "Somebody oughta take you in Try to make you love again  Try to make you like the way they feel  When they're under your skin Never once do you think that they would lie When they're holding you Then you wonder why they haven't called When they said they'd call you  You'll start to wonder  If you're ever gonna make it by You'll start to think  You were born blind"   i'm frustrated.  there's just this icky heavy feeling that angers me from deep within. it's that itch that won't go away. a certain feeling that creeps beneath my skin and irritates the hell out of me...and the ironic thing would be that it's all me.    me.   go the fuck away voices.     urlLink  i think that we are setting out to either be nuns or become lesbians. yes, i know muse, you will be the first i call.

      he's got me figured out..or so he thinks. all seven hundred and fifty two fronts he says. fronts.  i think maybe he does too. a little.  and perhaps that's why it hurts. or stings so badly.  because he knows.  sees.  this self-protection shit is fun. absolutely mind juggling(boggling)...keeps the brain cells active i suppose.   i'm fucked.  sigh.  but hey, where else can you get an asian-american-non-chicken-eater-nut-hater-language-muse-stupid-retarded-ass for a rollercoaster ride eh?

      i've come to realization that when the people at claiborne tell you to dry clean only, they mean  dry clean only . i sit here with black fluff shedding off my sweater and clinging to my skin from the static. it is not a pretty sight let me tell you. nevermind that my lazy ass was trying to save a few dollars..(okay yeah, i was just lazy but play along with this story will ya?:P ) but nooo...sheer curiousity got the better of me.  gah.

      i know you exist somewhere between these parallels. your lips moistened by falling rain that pierces through another atmosphere, i hesitate to say drenched because that seems so weak, and you are definitely not. the water soaks your shirt and sticks to skin, your guises are naked, your breasts swelled and peaked. it's cold outside but your smile is warm. inviting. you sway and motion a little as your fingers beckon towards me...taunting me. your sparkling eyes flirt and your sexy hips dance.  your lips mouth silent o's and a's but they emit nothing. in this world, the only rhythm i hear is the rain slapping against the pavement and even that has a melody. a pattern. a chant that evokes a trance-like, perhaps peaceful embodiment.  the sun sets at the end of the boulevard but right before, a single lonely ray pierces through the droplets and forms a rainbow. a promise. seven colors of change. seven colors of hope.  seven colors of love.

      i feel.  i hurt.  i touch.  i see.  i love.  i need.  i give.  i try.  i heal.  i stand up.  i brush off.  i walk again.  that lonely mile.  that cold solitudal wind.  that forceful voice.  why does it haunt again?  why does this cliff seem so easy to just jump(fly) off rather than to traverse down?  why am i weak?  selfish?  endings and beginnings.  leaving and coming home.  going and returning.  one minute happy, the next minute sad.  one minute confident, the next minute scared.  one minutes that never get past twos.  hiding, trying, falling, searching again.  i'm tired.  i'm angry.  i'm broken.  i, me, her, she, saya.  empty.  nothing.  fallen.  small.

      there's something very distinctively soothing and disturbing about matchbox on rotation.  i don't know what it is...these bitter tears aching to flow are intoxicating. distracting and therapeutic. something about the half scattered magazines on the floor and the wafts of perfume samples too fucking familiar against the accoustic guitars, drum beats and his raspy sexy voice. lyrics that simply just hurts. hurts because it's so damn relevant or hurts because it's everything i want/need/have to say...about going home...about finding myself...about all these things.."things"  sacred, untalked about, hushed bullshit.  stigmas.  diseases.  wanting to scream and scratch styrofoam together to hear that squeaking, piercing, irratable whine of friction mounted together. sado-masochism perhaps..i don't know what it is..  i don't know what it is..  maybe just unwell.  tired.  but still breathing..  it's hard to be in the middle.

       urlLink  "I think I need to stop hanging out with heterosexuals."    male lesbians that whip me, hit me, and call me edna especially..  :P  kids are amazing aren't they?  i want to hug, kiss and swing her around..she's torn the whole bitch-hates-the-world attitude i've managed to carefully brush on today...just so i have an excuse you know?  but as she runs forward to the candy machines and her tiny hands clasp my big silly ones, i am equally dumbfounded and mesmerized by her innocence  she can't decide between the choices and chooses soda instead;  root beer to be exact...then we gang up on picking on the old guy.  we spin quarters and she tells me about powerpuff girls, and the evil mojo jojo, and how she's the fairy godmother today.  her four year old eyes sparkle under the harsh flourescent light..  she granted me my only wish today..  i was happy.  free.  content.     ...amazed.

      Hold it in, I whisper to myself later.  I watched the car pull away, grow tinier and tinier into a distance then disappear. I retreat back alone into this now cold and empty house and walk into disrupted calmness.  I feel the teardrops slide off my face but I do not cry and smile instead. I think about the luxurious weekend I’ve had and the lushness of her warm body beneath the sheets. Her long, thin fingers wrapped with petite little rings and the way her curls frame her face.  We went to a traditional Catholic mass this morning. Her faith against mine I suppose, I’m Lutheran, or at least my parents are…and though the services are very much similar…there’s still quite a bit of differences in them. I loved the incense and candles, the ritualistic/holistic like atmosphere, the father-forgive-me-for-I-have-sinned kneeling and bowing, holy water…and the constant fervor of blessing yourself and making that cross thing. It was beautiful; to feel so lost in a crowd and found.  To have the world disappear before you…retreating into a lost island in the middle of February and have tornadoes crashing behind your porch yet feeling so surreally calm is breathtaking.   Midnight runs on the beach layered up in four layers and an anorak, laughing and feeling your Nikes sink into the sand. Stopping to pick up sand dollars and feeling the ferocious wind push you forward. Her increasingly passionate moans with the crashing of waves outside your bedroom window as her fingers find yours and you discover love together.  The ‘out of town’ rendezvous packs and your magical weekend ends in twenty-four hours.  You step in and you have to pick your troubles back up at the door but you breathe in deeper, and take stronger whiffs…just so to see if the smell of her is still on your clothes.   It is, and you smile again.  Tired, weary of the world….but walked out a while.   Had a break.

      waiting for another outlook..dressed again..somehow i've never put together this 'look' before and it gives me a very 'la-la' feeling...i've mixed some knits and cotton with a pair of pin-striped slacks..my hair's tied up in that messy attempting to be sexy look and i have these silver hoop earrings on. i can't decide between heels or mules and the make up says casual, gothic and bitchy at the same time.  perhaps this is what it's all about...reinventing yourself...being able to put on a 'facade' with whatever you have in your closet.  new major said the other day of the outfit, the one that screamed 'look up, please'...it was a just over the knee length dress, with this tying strings..choker like crap..and i'd put on a white one shoulder shirt on. it was 'artistic' but was it to call attention...be different? or was it just cause i wanted to feel 'pretty' that day?  i walked into 'gap'  yesterday and realized what a fucking shopaholic i was. everything i picked up, i'd seen before and the boys knew me by first name basis. i stepped out depressed and to a certain point, almost ready to cry. frustrated with myself.   i have such little control over my finances and it's pathetic how unthrifty i am. my concept of money should be flushed down the drain...i want to blame my upbringing but i realize this discipline shit and being responsible can only be up to me. my parents can only live so long and no matter how many millions, there are crude people out there and within me. irresponsible and just shitty with it, i'm tired of being the spoiled fucked up brat you know?  i don't know...it's a saturday and shit like this should not be psycho-analyzed.  the girl just arrived...we're staying at the beach house this weekend. just to 'get away from it all' or something. on a tornado watch...that's smart..  too many thoughts but i'll write it down later..gotta pack.

      dressed, sleepy, sorta lazily lounging around, cuddling and not doing much...  she's getting ready and plays around with layers and faces. grins at me through the mirror as i watch her in awe...mesmerized. god, she is beautiful.  i flip channels...and for a while, i almost fall into the category of 'the husband'.  flipping, waiting for her...watching the news...singing to myself.  more talk about war, more talk about rhode island. i turn away to hide the tears but then the glint from hers reflects against the mirror too.   it's silly, two girls dressed and made up crying over a news report..  i almost want to say lets not go tonight...lets just stay in and we'll make pasta and run over to blockbuster and maybe rent a movie or something?  but i know i need to get out...or at least she makes me anyway. she does her little jig, and i cannot help but fall into fit of giggles.   she's almost ready now...i get to drive tonight. (i'm in control!) she's tipsy, little alco...but i log in to say i need to do  something first;  it's pouring outside. i've never liked thunderstorms and this whole fire/club thing just hits too close to home.   be safe tonight okay? wherever you are...take care of yourselves.  it's hard to comprehend...the site is on 'hiatus' right now...part of me likes it this way yet the other itching to get it out again. get out of my corner and preach. drone you with long, long irritating whining posts  i love that a part of me is in this world...it always makes me feel so warm inside to 'come home'.   is this for attention? i don't know. but i got it anyway...perhaps i do like it. perhaps i do like going away every once in a while to be alone and find myself. discover the world around.   take care of yourselves people, it's a cold, vicious world out there.  be safe.  i love you.

      you know, there's nothing like going to the medicine cabinet and finding it empty.  time to go play hide and seek...  or lock and keep?  whatever really.  i've decided i'm going out tonight....i have five places to go to...two in which i don't really care for but have to.  i want to go take a long bath and start getting ready...but there is this imminent fear in having to look myself in the mirror and being afraid i might not be so okay later..  taking a bath normally also means a lot of things..sure, i figure i could just fuck myself and give myself a good time in steaming hot bubbly candle atmosphere...but why the fuck do people have to get naked to take a bath?  i wish i just didn't need to see myself, and just ignore. not feel so overweight and ugly and disgust myself.  why. why. why.  the odd thing is that i'm sleeping over at the girlfriend's house tonight. and she has all these things planned for us..i just feel so numb and sorta blah right now.  i'm not depressed though, just unfeeling.  my choice of music isn't exactly helping either..come on, melloncollie and the infinite sadness?...dumbass.  i had a really  beautiful  fucktastic conversation with the old guy tonight though...kissing and making up is fun. painful but really nice..  and for some really odd reason, the new major and i ended up having lunch then went shopping together. very interesting. nice though..i enjoyed it anyway..  hm..time to make voodoo cutouts of the ex...  bitter? me?  hell no.

      one of the drugs they were thinking about putting me on is called effexor...it's an anti-anxiety and anti-depressant..i just took a look at some of the side effects and already all my doubts and fears are starting to resurface again..  too much. too much.  what if it doesn't make me feel better? what if it makes me feel worst?  scary...i don't know. just strange.  'may cause aneroxia'.  excuse me, but isn't that like giving a knife to the suicidal?  though really, that might be it's strongest point right now...  must.  lose.  weight.  i had this meal today...and i feel so icky. indigestive. like my chest hurts and it's hard to breathe. i half don't want to get sick, half need to get sick.   "oh what a fucking dillema."   holy shit you're self-absorbed sometimes racheal.  i think i might go worry about the war now.  (insert too many complex morbid depressing thoughts)  or   not.

'okay'  'whatever'

      i bite back tears, bitter angry hurting tears..the big round drops that squeeze out and the choking horridly painful sobs i hate...i hate crying for you..about you..to you.  but here i am again, as always, with my heart ripped out into shreds and my soul bleeding...left to your transgressions, your verbal abuse, your meaningless/meaningful attacks.  i want to say remember when...but i'm afraid, the past stays in the past. to realize what we've become will hurt too much...but i don't forget, and that's why it gets bad.  i won't lie, this attention is great. sure. it's uplifting to find hope at the end of a torrid storm, it's fantastic to find the rainbow.  but you forget about this disease, you forget about how it consumes you and eats you alive  you forget about what little control you have over it and how extremely horrible it is  you forget what it's like to be the little person trying  or the weak one giving up  you forget the insanous crave for escape  she is sick. sicker than you'll ever know.  the hope is gone.  her brain fried.  her livers damaged.  her body failing on her.  her mind weeping.  but do you know?  do you care?  hell no.  you're too damn bent on taking her down.  too damn bent on proving your point;  that she wasn't worth love anyway.  well guess what mister  she waits.  and waits.  cries.  begs.  she looks silently at the phone again  and draws it back in  cuts herself  you'll never know will you?  you'll never see.  too blinded again.  she searches for answers.  and they put her 'on watch' again  she screams and says...what the fuck difference would it make?  i hold my fate in my hands goddamnit.  i decide when i die  her demons devour her alive  she begs for you to come save her  see her  but you'll never know  never know  because she puts the strong face for you  the bitchy slutty one  truth be told  it's just a lie.  she pretends for you  so you don't hurt  so you don't see her detoriate.  so you don't see her die  watch her take herself  feel her heart slow down against your palm.  you laugh, and you laugh again.  i finally pull the trigger.  you won't even come to the funeral would you?

      they all talk.. she tries to put on her 'i don't care really' mask but inside, a tiny tiny voice screams; i care. i give a fuck.  she wishes morbid occurences, pain that he'll feel her loss that when she's gone he'll realize why, and how he always did know her best she said, he said..they all said; they understood each other so perfectly it was torturous. and so they both wait waiting to see who will end up pulling the trigger first waiting to see who will weep at who's tombstone  death pounds them imminently now how ironic death started this  and death will end it.  if only you knew.

      - writing when no one is looking is very liberating.  - trying to look for an outfit for tonight is not.  - having the distinct feeling that your other mom and birth mom are about to claw each other out is not a good feeling.  - having a distinct feeling about clawing your other dad on the other hand though, is very satisfying right now.  - being stifled and being treated like shit is a horrible feeling.  - walking around without underwear on, being a bitch, and wearing only black while using the movie as an excuse is a good excuse. (...because i get to be somebody else or because it's an acceptable excuse(?) i don't know.)  - being excited to meet the rest of the cast tonight is pleasurizing.  - actually, just being excited about anything is pleasurizing.  - using the word pleasurizing seems very wrong.  - feeling like i have the reins back in my hand is calming. very special..  - talking a lot and overblogging obsessively to escape is even better.  - reading good email makes me fuzzy all over.  - eating real food makes me kinda feel like god. i'm nourished.  - not throwing up is even better.  - i have purple-green bumps on my thigh.   - time for some concealer.  - and a nice, cold, stainless steel spoon.  - perhaps even some lemon.  - instant messaging is evil.  - jennifer love hewitt is fucking gorgeous.  - i need to get ready...put on some layers.

      Perhaps there are a lot of things I’d wish to say…but words often betray me and I am left in a standstill of trying to decide between what's right and wrong, good and evil. Paths that I don’t necessarily want to take, but know I have to.  This getting better shit frustrates me, to say it is an uphill battle is an understatement. I understand the beauty and immense joy I will feel at the peak, there are just too many times thought where when slipping, it’d seem so much easier to give up. And given up I have, plenty and plenty of times.  This journey that goes through climaxes takes me through never ending landscapes, vast continents and faceless demons that I encounter. Angels that hold my hand and lead me along the way, I stumble and scrape myself, find pleasure in poking at my bruises; half to see if they’re real, the other half just to remember what physical pain feels like…and how it differs.  I tell myself to be grateful, and for many times, I am.  I have learnt that Tylenol is not strong enough to kill me, and Pensacola doesn’t really have many high-rise buildings, that the drivers here have too much damn etiquette and forget to just run me over when I step onto the street and honk instead. That Gillette razor blades are really quite hard to hold especially when ‘the pain in your heart isn’t as strong as the pain in my mind.’ I’ve come to realize that my asshole insurance company does not cover suicide attempts and so if I’m going to do it, to do it right.  But see I’ve also learnt that no matter how sad I am, no matter how broken, hopeless and ‘out’ I feel, that if I just press on….tomorrow will be a better day. Or the day after. Or the next day into it. I realize that I can make my super hard, super heart psychologist cry when I’m being honest and it’s okay. I’ve learnt that when I actually go for therapy and agree, things get so much easier. I get so much easier.  I am not perfect. I never will be. I’ve never come close to and I never will. And I want to say that if I just take down the bars a little I will be so damn much happier…but part of me knows I’ll never forgive myself for that; for lowering the standards, for reaching anything less than perfect…and so that internal conflict battles through and sometimes I am discouraged. Sometimes I am tired and lost. Very confused and hurting. Perhaps that it my biggest problem then…trying to be way more than I can be, trying to carry way more than I can handle. Trying to be Superwoman, Sheera and Storm at the same time.  Fuck me.  You know that feeling of tranquility that sort of envelopes you after a good cry? I sit here sniffling, sorta sleepy but extremely peaceful…and it just feels so good. So right. So something you could snuggle up to and sleep. and sleep for me is hard to define…but I could just let go, lie down, and sleep now.  It’s a good feeling.  Fixing…being able to know I’m being fixed is nice. Being able to know I’m fixable is nice.  I reached out and pushed back the other night.  The most important lesson I’ve learned is that I do this not only for myself but for the one’s around me.  …I started to list down the things people have said to me in the last few days…but it got long, too sappy and retarded, unless the other person and I read it. They were nice things though, good, solid, heartwarming things…and I am grateful.  I don’t want to return in a coffin, and my liver/stomach can only take so many sessions before it won’t even be my conscious decision anymore. I’m not sure if I regret it, but it was definitely stupid.   I want to say I’m sorry, thank you, and I’ll be okay at the same time.  The best thing would be that I’ll mean all of it.  Pretty cool huh?  I’m okay.

      is it good or bad...to tell you i love you?  to tell you the situations and ask for your opinions?  to get out of my own world and venture into others, maybe even yours, and see what the world looks like from the other side?  is it safe to hold my own very heart and place it next to yours, in your kind and gentle hands?  is is safe to trust?  i wonder if, when i sleep at night, the kids i used to play with in hospitals look down from above and smile...  or do they still make scrunchy faces when having boo-boos because i forget to keep my promises of going on or staying strong..  i wonder if heaven looks as neat, and as cool as i described it for them..  i wonder if i really believed that or as always, if i was just bullshitting my ass. like smiling so the world thinks you're okay and get off your back..  i wonder if talking is right and mentioning is okay.  if saying out loud and fixing problems instead of hiding is right  because i'm still afraid.  it still hurts.  this cut from where i've fucked myself over   and i wonder if it's safe to come out and play now  i wonder if it's okay  i wonder if you mind  i wonder if you're still angry, still upset, still hurt  because i didn't mean to  and if i could i'd take it all back  and if i could i'd let you hold my razor and slice me all the ways you were hurt  i'd let you make big blown up posters of mine as targets and even volunteer to be made fun of in your weekly column  because truth be told (heaven forbid)  i do care about you  and i deny it, but you mean so much to me  you are important in my life..and you touch so many others  i want to say please don't leave me  i want to say tell dopa and sara to shut up or racheal will come and kick their asses...because fear does that you know, fear makes you do crazy things  and so i want you to promise me you won't go  i want you to be there when i make it  when i grow up  i want you for all my selfish reasons because you mean /that/ much  don't do anything stupid.  and i won't.  and we both snort at that statement...  because it isn't about going away really, it's about escaping.  i'm trying to say all the things that i need to say  but none of it, i know, will really actually convince me when i've made up my mind  so here's my heart  my soul  i love you  sorry it's all imbalanced screwy now  you are an amazing, beautiful, intelligent, wonderful, caring human being.  and you make this world such a nicer place to live in.  you're granpa, and dad, and surrogate daddy, and uncle, and all the things a title can bring you.  but most of all you're /you/  and we all need the old guy around.  to laugh  smile  giggle  play  drive  eat  fight  condescend  be sarcastic to  pose  poke  irritate  agonize  talk  listen  watch  learn  understand.  just wondering..  have a good day okay?  thank you.

      She smiles…finally.  Two weeks over, her cloud has passed. Restored, she opens her gates.  She welcomes,  beckons…let sweltering rays implode her but stands tall and says  I will take this.  I will accept.  I will move forward.

      everytime you leave, it hurts all over again.  i tell you so many times i don't care anymore...but behind this sheild, so many times i want to reach out to just hold you. to just touch your fingers or hear your heart beat against my ear.  when i cry, or hurt myself, some part in me always wishes you were near...but you never are anymore  i cannot find you.  and so days when your user name signs off, my heart hurts and i don't know why.  i want so bad to reach out beyond this hiding and let you see me, but i'm more afraid of the consequences.  so i just watch you from afar, and keep you close to me.  i'll smile when you're happy, and weep when you're sad. but i know i cannot come out of these shadows, protecting you, selfishly, maybe even me, and maybe look down from up above...or down below.  i wish you could save me, but i know now to not wish on lofty dreams.  i have no dreams.  ...only love.  i genuinely, really loved you.  i genuinely will always love you.  i guess i went first huh?  perhaps you'll be at peace now.  or amused at least

      does it hurt because it's the truth or does it hurt just because?  this very pain that rips through me tastes almost distinctively familiar, nevermind that you were not a lover; in essence though, you came too near and broke too many walls. you tore right through and touched raw, bleeding flesh.  sometimes, it's when you pretend not to care, not to listen, not to give a fuck when you learn the most.  two points for me but you wanted to be a drama lecturer. like stan you said...and that whole thing about you'll be any age you'll be anyway so why limit yourself?  you see, i do listen. i do care...i'd just rather pretend not to...if only because i figure caring is evil and attempt to shut that shit off but fail desperately anyway.  i worry when you've had a sometimes bad day, when you're preparing for a role and it calls for being depressed.  you say i share your disease; in which case, then i think or even cannot begin to imagine what the ups and downs are like.  we talk about him. it's ironic how you tell me i just need to look for someone younger who can love me like you do?  love me like you do?  i'll smile because i'm afraid it will hurt.  i had three choices yesterday. get help, don't get help, die.  i chose the last option but couldn't go through with it. i panicked, and in the heat of that moment, rang up amanda.   'i've been stupid...very very stupid,'  and i broke down again.  i don't know how when falling, it seems to crash so much worst.  i close off but crave so much for someone to just understand.  i think about taylor and desiree, and perhaps even better times. i read again and i realize how painful it is to bear your heart and soul. it must be me then...the masochist in me flips between both sites and cuts with every line.  you both have a way with words.  love hurts.

      i sit here listening to keyboards being tapped.   unfeeling, almost numb to a certain extent. afraid to cry in case i'll never stop.  fought with the therapist, she screamed emergency room and i put back all my walls and stood up. i laughed, even if it hurt, and smiled even if it was fake...but no one could tell you see, no one knew.  i talked about being locked up and at forty degrees with only the bare minimal three layers of clothes on, i said no. fighting with the other voice on the phone, i paced around, jumped up and down and danced as they watched, trying to look for signs. she took the pills goddamnit, where are they? how many? what the fuck did you do to yourself racheal?  flushed my system and i was good to go again. 'good to go'.  but what they don't know is that i stopped by in between classes and walked straight in to purchase another bottle.  extra strength tylenol, 500g, 18 years old, no breakfast, 103 pounds.   lets call the poison control center again.  hie, my name is sarah. it wasn't intentional. i am fine. (i am scared)  do i want to die? do i want to die? do i want to die?  plans being formulated in my head, now that there are no more dreams...i plan my death.  tonight. (after church?)  later on. (after gayle?)  tommorow morning. (after the gym?)  but i have a cast meet tomorrow night. i need to be there, i have to be there. i still have so much i tell myself, i still have a lot more to live for. live for racheal i ask myself almost condescendingly?  hell bloody fuck no.  i'm fucked. i'm fucked.  someone fix me.  i write to no one.  the site's shut down.  no one reads this but me. some perverse pleasure of seeing pain typed out. keeping memories. tabs. this was when i tried to kill myself. this was when i had a nervous breakdown. this was when i fucked up.  but i'm afraid.  do i want to die?  do i really want to die?  or do i jsut want to escape?  but i cannot afford to. i have school and i have the movie and i have all these damn bloody fuck things going on.  then why? why? why?  i'm going to be quiet now.  i just need to go to sleep.  i just need to rest.  i just need to shut down a while and things will be okay later.  later.  later.  will later come now please?

       take a step forward from hiding beneath the shadows because i figure fight pain with pain. how much more can honesty hurt now that it's been unleashed.   you tell me not to use any references to me, but it's the only thing i know right now, selfish on my part i know, but just being me, living me, consumes all of me. because precisely like you said, if i let someone in, i fuck things up. you hurt me too marc, i won't attempt to measure that.   you're the only guy, real person, i've really let down my guard to. the only person i've managed to ring when i was afraid, the only person i've told when i was hurting, the only person i've let in to see me cry. if that is not trust, i don't know what is.   i don't want to beg, or plead. you have your rights, and i should walk away from this knowing that i have crossed a line. it wasn't somethng i did on purporse, and far nothing was meant to  that intention.    i actually care about you. hard to believe but i do, i'm sorry you never saw any of that in me. i'm sorry i have become so ugly, so tainted, so immature to you....and perhaps i am.   so many thoughts run through my head, i want to run up to you and shake you and ask you what in the god damn hell happened yet i am afraid to be in the same room as you are. i'm afraid i've overexposed and let you in and all this shit hurting feelings just isn't good right now.    i try to look for all thewords to say but my mind betrays me.    and so i lock up, freeze and fuck up again. i wonder if you feel as much pain, not because i want to curse it to you but just if i meant as much as you did to me.   do i regret anything? would i take back anything?   no. because as much as it hurt to turn the other way and let go of your hand, i treasured this little path i had with you.   i'm sorry you hurt.   i'm sorry it seemed like i never cared.   i'm sorry i messed up   but i guess being sorry doesn't fix anything sometimes does it?    pain matures you. i guess i've learned a lot.   i didn't think you were any of the things i said. it was just a careless thought the people outside thought, perhaps i'd figure you knew where i stood.    apparently not.   sorry   I have a rose and half a heart-shaped box of Ferrero Rocher chocolates sitting here by my computer.  How could something so beautiful go so wrong?  Maybe it can't. I dunno.  Time heals.  I love you, Racheal Khong (said with an accent). You will never know how much.  I swear I do.  Marc  (PS. Get your lazy butt up and go to school.)

      so i finally did it.  i emptied all the bottle's content and swallowed. lying on the bathroom stall, i wreaked and threw up...sick and tired of it all; i reached into my bag and jangled. walked ever so calmly to the water fountain, betrayed all my idiosyncrasies and drank from it. two gulps, that's all it took to keep me numb. that's all it took to feel the pills slide down my throat....straightened myself out then went to class.  i didn't panic, if anything, i was more peaceful than before. was this how i would stand before death's door? calm and accepting, self-depricating.  i felt my heart slow down, my feet get heavier, my eyes harder and harder to keep open. the tears came in a flash, in a moment, i begged for help...but when help came i ran.  threw up again.  i tried to kill myself again today, this is not good.   i just want to go away.

      i forget that if you turn towards the red knob and sit in the water you'll scald your skin...and so i have angry red splotches on my body. i forget that if i don't eat my fingers start to shake and this light-headed feeling is not just an extension. i forget that i have to get dressed or get out of bed and i cannot tell if it's night or day because i haven't stepped out of these four walls. i alternate between hours of crying and passing out, break and smash my pills, pull my hair and cry again.  i burn myself forgetting that my cigarette is lit and walk out into the cold with only my knickers on to bring the mail in. i curl back into the fetus position and rock myself to sleep and sleep again. i sleep so much i am numb and when i finally am i pick up phone calls, open gifts and reply emails. i answer the phone and turn in homework before the hour comes around and i crash again.  flesh against the cold reflection, i poke at another bruise and curse myself. i hate the girl in the mirror and this time i don't even bother to look for that bitch hope. i only stare back at this other bitch that looks at me and tear her whole being apart. i crave for touch and feelings but flinch when they find me. i reach out but my hand betrays me and pulls back.  i am alone. alone. alone. pain consumes me and i don't even know why. hurting, letting my disease eat me alive. feed the starving child.  afraid of food, afraid of praying to the porcelain gods. afraid of praying.  will you help me please?  don't let me kill myself.  don't let me hurt me.  don't let me be stupid.  please.

      I probably  should  hold my peace but here are my few words instead.  Went to the head doctor today, it was interesting to say the very least.  An ‘emergency’ session they called it, help! the girl was losing it. Fucking up the mental and physical, oh screw that.  She wasn’t suicidal she kept on repeating, she was okay, damnit, just believe her she begged,  she was okay . Really.  But she still heard the jangling of pills in her head, still felt her heart pound out from her chest as adrenaline and anxiety flowed through her…still heard the thoughts in her head that said jump, stand in front of that car, fly, cut, swallow, sleep.  She wasn’t crazy. She wasn’t mental.  She was just Normal and Real. Just like the other girls, just another ordinary girl…  But she shook so hard last night she bled, so utterly lost and confused. Screaming, yelling and catatonic, she reached out into the abyss unknown, drew back shades and cried. Shrieked for help and so they brought her in. Tranquilized her as she became manic, panicked and nervous again.  As she broke down and was wretched in pain again they shot her.   Blood levels too low, no sugar, no substance they fed her through saline and she felt immense pleasure in the pain and absolute horror. They were feeding her, they were keeping her alive, they were making her stay.   Putting nutrients in her because she turned crazy with the sleep and food deprivation. It fucked up the chemicals in her brain and made her so depressed. So unable to function. Live.  She wouldn’t feed her demons so in turn, they tormented her.  Her heart went no, no, no but her mind begged please, please, please.  Please just get well Racheal, please just let them fix you, she cried with herself. But she couldn’t and it was so hard, she felt so wasted and worthless. So valueless and hurt. There was just too many people to deal with, too many problems to stomach in a night that she was already cracking.  But then the hundred dollar an hour therapist sits down with her and cajoles. For two hours they talk and she wavers in between crying, being silent, whispering, talking and screaming. She alternates between the raging emotions in her and her disappointment. In herself, in others, in the world around her. God and the being above, the people she lived with, the girl she slept with, the image in the mirror. They worked through so much and nothing at all, and finally, very slowly, they made progress again.  And so she lies down here watching the big hand cross the little hand and signal a quarter past the hour. She is sleepless again, but stable. Sane.  It feels so good to be sane. It feels so good to be numb.  Subdued and chick-flick, pill-popping, cigarette-smoking, happy.  She finally smiles again.  She runs.  Hides.  Tired of the world.    "I prayed last night, I crouched in and held myself as the demons played around in my head and begged for you."

         and she smiled @ the lifeless image in the mirror. we had learned what we had seen. nothing remains.

      I don’t tell anyone because I think it only scares them, or hurts them. It scares me too, it scares me to think about how absolutely little control I have on these reins when I am falling.  I tried to kill myself twice this week.  I don’t know how it came or why. Only that in those moments, I was looking to escape being Racheal a while. I’m not sure if I wanted to die, or if it was my way of saying I needed a break. I needed to Stop. Escape. Run. Hide.   The coward’s way is suicide. I am a coward. I am bad with this feelings shit and taking care of myself. Bad with handling things and loving, trusting, accepting myself.  I wish I could tell you that I was just being stupid and that I was okay now, the truth is, I don’t know.  I don’t know what happens to me when I get sad or abusive, I don’t know what happens to me when I get terrified of the world around me and when I am so afraid, angry and disappointed with myself. I cannot tell you what happens or why it happens. If it’s just the chemical imbalance in my brains or hormones or the lack of nutrients or if it’s just fucked up me.  I cannot tell you why I tear myself apart or have such dark morbid thoughts.   The truth is, I don’t know why I get so happy and sad in a split second. I don’t know why I crave being alone and hate loneliness in the same heartbeat. I don’t know why I have become such a child, a bitch, an asshole and a despicable whore.  I don’t know why I am not capable of loving or being loved. I wonder sometimes what is so wrong with me and why I cannot just make the face in the mirror disappear. Go away. Fuck off.  I am in so many pieces. Shards. Smithereens.  Tonight, I held a razor blade against my skin and finally felt the pain before it cut me. I didn’t want to kill myself really, I just wanted to see what it would be like. Some part of me was just crying out, reaching out. Some part of me just hurting.  The thing is though, I’ve been doing so fucking well. I’ve been more sane and happy in the last few weeks than I’ve ever been since I’ve had this problem. I’ve been more okay and confident with myself then anything else. I’ve stood up for myself this week and walked out the door.  Yet it feels like I’ve also slipped back to where I started from. It feels as if I’m fourteen again and running on empty and being two people at once. The public Racheal and the private Racheal. The similarities are definitely there, I’m sick again. Killing myself slowly, painfully, but is this pain truly worth it?  I have so many material things going for me, and everything is truly fine and dandy on the surface. The pressure mounts and I crack when nobody is looking, I fall and stumble and scrape myself. When the curtains are drawn, I peel off the masks and out emerges this terribly fucked up child. And out emerges Me.  I don’t know what is wrong with me. I don’t know how I ended up so lost and confused. I don’t know why I’m so lost and confused.  Sometimes it’s as if I’m looking from another dimension and I see all the things I already am, can be, and will be. I see hope in big bold print but when I reach out to touch it it’s as if it disintegrates before me and falls to the ground.  I hate burning from both ends and feeling as if I’m tugged from both sides.  I rang my parents up tonight and we talked. I sobbed so hard I couldn’t breathe and rocked, rocked, rocked, as the pills in the bottle made a jangling sound and soothed me. It felt as if I held my fate in my hands and it was all going to be okay. But would it be okay if I swallowed it or was it the other way around?  I reached out.  I am still reaching out.  I’m trying to be strong and say this is who I am sometimes and if someone would just say it was okay to be weak. If someone would just say it was okay.  But I hate it that I am writing this.  That I am showing this side of me that doesn’t have something smart to say or isn’t bitchy and laughing about something. This side of me that isn’t strong.  But I can't handle it and I am so disintegrated.  I am begging/pleading/praying for help.  But I don't know what for or what it's worth.  I'm pathetic.  I really just want to be okay.     urlLink  To do the useful thing, to say the courageous thing, to contemplate the beautiful thing: that is enough for one man's life. - T.S. Eliot

       cheese.   something she said upset the photographer tonight.  she hurts.  perhaps this trust thing just feels so threatening now. she swears it isn't personal, just a mere folly of liking her brick walls put up. or letting the questions bombard her mind so she's 'safer'.  she trusted him once, and now as she is dying alone she wonders where he is.  it hurts.  her fault.  her fault.  her fault.  ugly, dirty, undeserving child.  she wishes she could do something for the other person that walked her through hell..as his world falls apart she wishes she had superglue too.  wants to say 'it's going to be okay' with the same assertiveness he used with her but knows she wouldn't believe it too.   his words strike chords again.  she's confused tonight.  time to retreat to her little hole.  time to run.  she's been here too long.  she wants to cut herself. wants to see blood spurt out of her veins to know 'pain'.  crashing down tonight, she falls.  she walks.  she meets her maker.     ...he turns the other way.     urlLink "if i'm going to suffer i need to suffer alone.

                                             Maybe she remembered what it felt like to have the cold square steel in her hands...  or how liberating it felt..  after a long break of between three months, she picked up the camera again. She'd forgotten what it felt like to see the world through these lenses and show the others what her world looked like.   She ran a bath for herself..shuffled in various dark melancholic albums and switched off the lights.   She craved being in the dark and hiding. Something about the room glowed, something about having it's only lightsource to be a collaboration of flickering flames soothed her.  She stripped, and as her clothes touched the floor, so did her teardrops fall.   Her guiltiness having thrown up her dinner ten minutes before gnawed at her as she furiously belittled herself and attempted to shut the voices. When all was done with the square case, she laid it on the side next to her glasses.  Blinded, naked and empty, she climbed in and read.  Cleaned.  Cleansed.    urlLink  "It is more of the bittersweet feeling that I get. That intense feeling that doesn't fully show itself.

      there are times where she looks so old, aged and to a certain extent haggard. tired and weary of the world as you spot the eye bags and the diminishing sparkle, the weary limbs and the breaking body.  then you look closer and closer or maybe just search harder and you realize she's just a little girl forced into womanhood. her eyes are still so naive, her body still growing. you watch her mind develop yet there is still that immature selfishness that kids hold on to and then you realize, she's really trying quite hard.  so you scale down the difficulties or help her figure them through and suddenly she realizes there's such a thing as hope and there's such a thing as living. trying.  she smiles again and runs. dances in her little red outfit and tumbles through the grass asking if she can have another scoop of ice-cream as she licks the melting chocolate whipped cream off her fingers and grins.  still a kid yet so much a woman.  if only she could figure it out..

      When you wake up with an ass throbbing head pounding ache, it’s about the same time you commit to that resolution of never getting wasted again.  And so last night, when they were at the  urlLink sexy boy’s  place (who still owes her Arbys and nude pictures), she very intelligently only had little to drink but much to get silly over.  Because she’s already plugged in one half of the duo, here’s  urlLink the other one  that had to keep Mr. Happy away from Mr. Peepee while being the asshole. Who plus also gave her the obligatory bonus hug at the end…Whoop. Whoop.  They stumbled and laughed over tits and obscene amounts of lard ass to be voluntarily chosen to be put into a film and sniffed ‘ginger’ and ‘peach-something-something’ shampoo as the dirty eye was given when remarked at how ‘airport-ty’ the place smelled. Nevermind that extra painful lengths with scented candles and a single solitary pink rose (yes, I noticed) were taken to unmask the  ‘We're just frat boys in a bachelor pad’  mask.

Ah, and sweet bliss in giggling myself silly at the clink of every bottle on the table proceeds to naming that ‘Amy’s my favorite’ and various other more interesting rules that result with everybody getting more and more ‘happy’.  Minus the long-winged cockatiel and the missed silence of Yen-Yen the chinese-american Eskimo rubbing up against me, it was a good one.  But damnit, still no smiley-faced  waffles  pancakes..

Or a nomination at the very least..  My comfort space intruded in so rudely, backed into a corner with no damn choice or reasoning.

Upset for not a good reason at all, lets handle this like two perfectly mature adults as he tightens the strings on my leash and condescends me.  (Well, you’re (definitely) not the type of guy I fall in love with are you?)  What isn’t said beneath the surface is horrifically fiery. Hell hath no wrath like a woman, I remember that now. But I keep all my sarcastic remarks and painful anger to myself and wallow instead at this god forsaken hour and ask why me?  This isn’t some puppy love cute attraction shit, this is a whining, obsessing, compulsive, egoistical, head-up-my-ass, won’t leave me alone attraction.  Perhaps my last saving grace and worst thing is that it was a good friendship.  Why, goddamnit, why?

      Candle flames flicker as it’s glow resonates throughout the room, falls over encapsulating it into an almost sacred territory. Spiritual?  Beer bottle in hand and late nineties rock music he once introduced to her fill up the picture. She lies with chest to the ground and rests, her dress sits crumpled at the end of the room, her shoes hastily taken off the moment she returned back to her sanctuary. Barefoot and tired, she poeticizes to the demons of her night. Charming, as if dangling a carrot to the terror nights before and two-hour sleep days. She runs on nothing, not food, not rest and definitely not sense…but she loves it. She rises, stumbles awhile but feels victory at the end. Tastes it on her lips.  She is not intoxicated as per say, she still can walk a(somewhat) straight line and countdown from a hundred, but she is definitely Numb. Unfeeling and blind almost, blind to hurt and feelings but she is still able to understand. To define. To write.  Roses sit slowly dying on her desktop; she says they are to dry but secretly probably has a perverse pleasure in seeing it wilt away. Of letting go of materialism and all these bullshit notions of courting rituals.  She comes home at around two, considerably pretty damn early for a Friday night. Exceptionally especially for her. Fridays are nights filled with excitement and anticipation. Of swing dancing, clubbing, karaoke-ing, driving around aimlessly and sharing…laughing. Friday nights most importantly though, represent Freedom. When there are no early classes the next morning, no homework that needs to be handed up in three hours but most of all, Friday nights represent this inexplicable need for Habits. Rituals. Practices. Friday nights almost by law must be good ones.  But last night she chose to go home early. They had broken her ritual and gone to a pretty little restaurant, ate and slow danced instead, driving to beach and downtown and to various other places in a synergy. It was a night of celebrating Love and everywhere she went there was red. She liberated in it and the catcalls and wolf whistles of the party that once made her giggly now only made her anxious.  Consistent begging only irritated her more, she had had a good day but was ready to curl in and rest her thoughts. They flew through faster than she could handle, the masochist in her spoiled the party and said, home. Home. Home.  Not even waffle house at four am, or taking up the offer of the party that was supposed to end the night of all nights. Too tired she claimed, but everybody knew why, she’d been in the real world for too long and she was sick of it.  Well, it is Saturday now and my aching bones feel smashed, pulped and wringed. I must be growing old…or maybe it is the lack of nutrients and rest against the other piling problems. Yet yesterday was an extremely long one too…oddly enough, there are still men out there.  They just make me nervous that’s all.  They clamor and intrude into my bubble and I shy away or hold my ground and drive them to the door. It is hard to have straight thoughts on a day that represents bullshit beginnings like this…  I wake up to the shrill sounds of the phone ringing…it’s a quarter past eight and I’ve just now fallen asleep. I want to yell and scream but think instead about the effort he’s making. My head throbs and my body is sore, my mind frozen. I go through motions as he tries to pry out details from last night ; that jealous bitch. :P  In retrospect, I had a pretty interesting day…or had my ego boosted at least.  I sat at the dock, feet dangling and mind slightly not there and watched the seagulls play and the mullets leap as the first break of dawn emerged. I read and wrote, then thought to myself how amazing God’s creation was as the first rays of light cascaded me.  I  walked  stumbled back in, a sunny beautiful gorgeous morning, and slept.    urlLink  “it was a "st. valentine can fuck off" celebration.”

       I just don't post it that's all! :P  February 11, 2003 - 5:31am   Yes, she is capable of love she says. Hidden far beneath this dark, deep, complicated exterior lies innocence still untapped. She is jaded, skeptical of the ones that are around her. Is it just sex that you want? Is it just Lust that makes you stay and not Love? She wonders sometimes…  Laying around and listening to Fountains of Wayne play obsessively at this hour intrigues her. Reminds her about the beauty he once forced on her, the way his fingers would trail her flesh and rub against her bones. She’d cower and scream, running to switch off the lights before he’d catch her again and tickle her endlessly…oh, how their laughing and giggling would ring through out the house and resonate through the walls.  He’d call her sexy, and beautiful and tell her she was intelligent. They’d make dinner together and go through mundane everyday motions but those were the best times she remembered. She didn’t care much about the expensive diners and holidays but she loved the warm fireplace and falling asleep next to him.   She found out about love with him. Long-distance love.  He rings her to see how the day is going. The site bookmarked and thumbed through obsessively, she feels like a thief in the night, catching him as he plays the same game. He knows she knows, and she knows he knows. But they keep silent anyway…still playing. Still restrained.  It’s been three years since they’ve ended but he still keeps his promises. His integrity in being there for her never ceases to amaze her. He envelopes her with love so deep that she finally understands the true meaning of love forever no matter.   How naïve they once were…so innocent. So free.   She keeps with her the lessons he has taught her. He’s earned a chapter or two in her Book of Life and carefully, once in a while, she reads through it. She escapes back into memories with the yellowed pages and lost snapshots. The candid moments and his face after a long flight home.   They’ve gone their own ways and are with different people, but she knows she’ll always have his love.  And so his, hers.

       1. Explain why you started to journal/blog.  inner me wouldn't accept outer me and outer me hated inner me. i seem so god damn different on the outside, so damn happy, hyper, ecstatic, "perfect" and it always feels as if it is just a layer. a show. i couldn't find me, and couldn't love me and some how, amazingly, this has helped a lot. i guess it's always nice to come to some place and say, you know what? i've had a bad day and fuck that and fuck me and i've hurt myself, and i'm hurting, and i'm in so many pieces with so many thoughts and no 'safe' place.   i shudder to think about how much i've changed yet i relish in that. me the bullimic, sick, fucked up child can finally challenge the other person. the one on the outside that's sucessful and strong and bitchy and "confident" and all these other programmed crap i use as a defence mechanism.  the crazy thing is that, it feels really good.    i guess i also wanted to bitch, bitch, bitch a lot.  a LOT.  :P   2. Do people you interact with day to day or family members know about your journal/blog? Why or why not?  mmhmm.   becaussseeeeee!  pah, well, for a long time i wrote under a pseudonym. it was nice and beautiful and special and all that crap but i was doing exactly all the things i did not want to do.  i did not want to hide.  i did not want to run.  i did not want to have all these different parts of me.  i did not want me to be separated into different categories and hell, i felt schizopherenic. (i also can't spell if you can't tell already...)  so..  i took little steps.  and more steps.  and soon i learned that if someone could not accept me when i was deep shit ugly and hating myself then was it really worth it at all?   i put so much damn pressure on myself not realizing that it's okay to be silly, and incredibly insecure sometimes.  besides, sometimes, it's easier written out than said.  this is my legacy, whenever...i just wanted someone, anyone, to have a part of me or at least know me on some level before i die you know? (holy shit i said the d word.)  even having said that though, i still get piss ass jittery and berate myself for the rubbish i put up in here when i know the people that are reading, are reading.   oh well.    3. Do you have a theme for your journal/blog?  home.     4. What direction would you like to have your journal/blog go in over the next year?  i honestly, have no idea.   if you realize, i go into moods where i just need to be alone or if i feel as if there are too many people watching, or if i've opened up too much and so i go on hiatus from time to time. i think about going home this summer and how that's going to turn out...or with my health and shit like that. i think about how that's going to affect me and all the words i might say in here. i just never want this place to not be safe anymore i guess.  there are no direct specific paths, perhaps that is the beauty of keeping this thing...?    5. Pimp five of your favorite journals/blogs.  why? why? why? do you do this to me?!!?!?  go  urlLink HERE . they are all shittingly good, and ferociously loved.  so hah.     urlLink  "just some opinions, for what they're worth. just pretend i'm a loudmouth in a bar who takes his opinions too seriously."

      She smiles. Wakes up into a lifetime of memories relived in 60 seconds, slept in an hour, dozed off in 90 minutes. She looks around and slips into another brand new outfit, the crisp sound of plastic being torn off as loud eighties music bombards the early morning air. It is beautiful outside; seventy fucking degrees! Silly pink and red paper strewn all over the room from an impulsive visit to the late night dosage of Mass, Wally's world. Colored tissue thrown around with streamers to mark this happy unpleasant day..she giggles to herself as she catches a glimpse of the outfit for tonight.  Black stilleto strappy heels, flowing wishy layered black dress fitted just right...something in her size(!) and black beaded choker with diamonds that could knock your ass out. Special, she feels good.   She throws up.  But this time it's just from the medication and she is well. No, I mean  Well.   She skips off to school, too excited for breakfast and finds herself at class boinking away at the keyboard recalling tales of the night. Homework and charts all nicely and exquisitely mapped out..math equations solved and papers written.  Teacher bitching(lecturing) now. Sneaks off and visits the rest of the world, sick of her voice and her whiny pathetic crap but laughs anyway.  (Excited!!)  :P  Happy fucking Valentine's Day!!!

      If I could pull out just one moment out of the time frame we’ve shared; it would be that one night at Waffle House with our sorry intoxicated drag happy asses looking for quarters to play the ‘Yo Te Voy Amar’ song. It would be that time when we kicked the jukebox as it replayed obsessively ‘Sweet Home Alabama’ and being our ditzy selves, we danced instead. Nevermind that we were in full stage make-up glory at three thirty in the morning with about a quarter of our cast singing and grills going on. Nevermind that it was see-through windows and harsh fluorescent lights that frankly, did nothing to our complexions, with half eaten smiley faced whipped out waffles and too many tears cried.  When the eight of us group hugged and wiped each other’s tears off and made each other smile.  It was that time when we ran through the mall laughing so hard we had to stop to breathe and try and stand still from the convulsion of giggles we got just by looking at each other.  …or playing lets see who can fly at the steps in front of the theater and messing up each other’s dressing rooms. Playing cards in between scenes with obscene pictures on them and finding every moment we could to take a sneak at the audience’s reaction.  Fun times I tell ya, fun times.  This show, as the spring production comes around I sit here remembering all the times we’ve shared and instantly, a smile lights up my face as your name flashes on my caller id and the queen of drama commands me to get off my sorry butt and go galavanting.  A hastily scribbled note found among stacks and stacks of notepaper filled with doodles and sayings.   “Live only in the moment: don’t look back to the regrets of the past, only look to the possibilities of the future,”   I remember now. I forgot.  I get ready and take a nice long piercingly warm shower and tickle myself with forgotten and newly made memories. I hum to Ben Harper and say fuck yeah at the moments. I scrub off the grime and slather on lotion onto moist skin renewed. I pick up my outfit and twirl around in front of the mirror and I am happy with the person that dances in front of me.  I leave my face bare except some gloss and perfume and click off the lights as excitement and anticipation for the rest of the night fills me.  Another adventure in the life of the Bobsy twins as I whip out my camera and you give me reason enough to take pictures again. If only so we can look back at this in print and laugh at the boys or how damn good we look tonight. :)  I never thanked you for the rides or the good cries. For allowing me to be your friend when you were hurting and yours mine. I laugh at how your face says everything as you naïvely, unsure, step out of the dressing room and we gush at each other’s outfits. Or the way you trust me enough to say fuck that and the way I trust you enough to tell you I was bad today.  I remember when you walked up to him and quite closely almost slapped him for touching me, or gave him the dirty look as you told him what your opinions were. I remember how you snatch away my phone when I am feeling vulnerable and you appear at my house when I tell you I’m breaking.  When I joke about the songs you have to sing at my funeral and kid around about what I’d like to be inserted in. I remember the first day we became friends and how far we’ve come now…  I remember shit like that and think now hell yeah I’ll be just fine alone.  If only because you believe in me enough to tell me I can do it and I trust you. That Rome wasn’t built in a day and sordid love is not the only type of relationships I’ll have.  Your perky little damn ass runs in and says Lets go! Lets go! as you stub out my cigarette and drive over to terrorize the ‘photographer’  You know, perhaps double dates just aren’t too bad at all.  :P     urlLink  "I will however, wear underwear on my head, jump around all spastic and yell "gleeb eep norp bop doo waaaah earp snob" at the cokcateil. =) "

Faith.   8:30 pm-  we get out and she wants to get coffee but she gets into an argument with the boy and we're stuck on our side of the island in a parking lot. it's oddly amusing how emotional things get towards the pms stage. we end up laughing at how silly we're being and head home. her exhausted from a day full of random shit, me just tired.   9:00 pm-  i come in and there is a package on my bed. i shriek and laugh and giggle. my first thoughts are always him but fuck that. it never is anyway.   9:05 pm-  a fucking good card, a letter, chocolates, candy, roses, a teddy bear and silly lingerie(you pervert) later...i feel tears not the sad icky type but just good tears and i am overwhelmed.  "just thought you needed to feel special."  i ring and scream and want to say so many things but it's only about five in the morning his time and i say thank you thank you thank you. remind me not to mess up this friendship.  i start out to write this but the aching body protests and so i soak till everything is wrinkly old. warm, bubbly and soothing. i fall asleep and this time it's good.  i sleep.  :)   urlLink  "There was no exhiliration, no impulse to celebrate. Just an overwhelming sensation of closure, as if all my bones dissolved and I could only sag in relief."

      Hit me, slap me and call me Edna.  That’s how weak I am around you, shitfaced and fucked.  You attack, as if your words would pierce through this thick skull of mind and hurt it, it doesn’t. It only stabs through my heart and fucks with my emotions.  I don’t remember why I let you do this, only that when I am vulnerable, you are never there.  …and you wonder why I don’t come close anymore.  You give me no reason to. No reason to stay, no reason to try, no reason to like myself around you. That’s always kinda hard when your favorite game is to tear me into pieces and watch my flesh slowly be made into jerky. Wringed, dried, processed and slowly wilted away. Preserved in some sordid state, scrunched up consumed with guilt.   Valentines day makes it about a million times worst. It makes me think of past lovers and before the words are even out of my mouth I see your condescending bastard attitude that labels me again. It’s funny how I almost swear you are so uncannily right sometimes, that when you choose to be an asshole, there is almost a perverse pleasure in playing your game.  Lets see who breaks down this time. Lets see who pushes the other over the cliff. Lets see what great things we can hurt each other and accuse the fuck out of each other.  It’s become a sink or swim situation.  …quite literally too.  You sink as you fight to get back up to shore or drown which in case means you’re fucked anyway or you bloody stand up and hold your ground only to swim in your tears. Can’t win anyway.  It’s not a game damnit.  Yet it doesn’t hurt as much when you call me names anymore. Whore, slut, bitch, fucked up…I run through the list and they’re starting to just become words to me.   Instead of weapons you used to hold against me, instead of missiles you use to aim straight at me.  Being in a warzone, a crossfire.  Why am I so used to that?  It’s almost a ‘here we go again’ dejavu like existence. I wait for the day when you will truly know what it has been like. What it was. When your blindness doesn’t cloud your judgment anymore and you learn that attacking is not always the best answer.  And I would know considering I’ve done all that before, attacked, yelled, screamed, bitched, realized…and here I am again. And again. And again.  I am tired now. I’d like to go to bed. Tell your demons in my head to shut up. Tell the gnomes playing trickery in my heart to die. Tell your voice that pounds my mind to fuck off. Tell your empty words and lies to take flight.  Tell my sorry self to disappear again.  I have no personality around you. No name, no face, no heart. I am merely just the girl that torments you and fucks you up.  I'll break it down for you; you’ve left every other time and wonder why I won’t trust you. Wonder why I am horrid around you yet I can be so lovable, so wonderful around other relationships. Why do I not treat you like the rest of them? Why do I actually give a fuck time and again?  I’ve shown you my soul, and you’ve raped it again, and again, and again.  Yet here I am, bearing soul when the only thing you want is flesh.  You don’t understand me. You don’t know me. You use hatred as an excuse. Too cowardly to admit that I am something and I am far beyond anything you imagined. I am unclean, dirty and sick but at least I have passion, have heart and even still my soul.  You think I’ve sold it to the devil.  Well think again, because no matter how short my life turns out to be, you’ll always have to live with turning your back on love. You had it once, twice, forever but you’ll never have my soul.  I don’t trust you.  You will probably end up scarring yourself further by attempting to bring me down again.  You claim you don't give a fuck but really, at least I'll admit it.  I hate feeling the way I feel about myself around you. Poison, you are like deadly nectar to my system. I swear I can almost taste it now.  Take flight before we hurt ourselves some more.  Walk.  Please don't return.  Leave.  I almost don't care if it hurts.

      I scour through a chockfull of boxed up memories and pull out this distinct moment. The aura that surrounds it, this smell, your touch, the emotions in it are still vividly there…your heart still pounding beneath my rested ear, your voice still clearly audible beneath the whispers.  It was our first road trip alone, sixty miles for a gig out of town. It was a good one wasn’t it? Holding our breaths going through the tunnel and that damn traffic, convinced I was going to be cyanotic any moment now. Watching you play to yet another full house, smiling as you looked out across the room and smiled into mine, I’m proud of you silly. Getting your ass plastered, knackered beyond reasoning and having the rest of the band’s drunk asses to deal with, the little groupies that traveled out to watch you too and dreams slowly being realized.   Learning to drive your big ass stick home as you handled the gears and I focused on clutch, gas, clutch, gas, oh fuck me now, gas.  We had a good laugh didn’t we? Yes, we’d laugh so hard and silly it was stupid. They’d be so sick of how incredibly pussy whipped you were behind that rock star drum banging punk exterior.  You made me so bad and angelic at once, so naughty and good.  …That was when I still took pictures, when I used to show people the world through my lenses. I captured those moments only to be put in your inlay later, only to be published and shown to the whole wide world with pride. You grinned your silly grin and brought the pictures around saying Look at this! Look at this! Loving me as if I was the best girlfriend in the whole entire world.  Next to the work of professionals and promotional bullcrap you took pride in mine and that made me feel so special. Important. You always seemed to make me feel so big and tall, so valuable.  But it was that very same destination, driving home from that very same city that made me realize that I was more in love with being in love than it was actually Love.  When you’d have to soothe me late at night when the evil attacks came. Or when you’d listen through the door with the sound of the water running and me puking my guts out. When you’d wait after every doctor’s appointment to see how badly things had progress or gone better and begged me to take treatment and I’d always plead with you to just shut up. To be quiet, to respect my decisions, to let me live it my way.  You’d always try to tell me I was beautiful but I was so broken then that I’d never believe you. Never let you touch me, see me completely. I’d always say No, or switch off the lights, or turn the other way. And it was always Him.  Funny how I always blamed it on Her and thrived on how badly we’d both rebounded. We’d crack jokes but we always knew. It was over before it started yet I know what we had was Real, just not Ordinary.  Breaking up with you through a pillow fight and sending you off again. Avoiding phone calls and distancing myself away, telling you we needed to go back to our own ways and this wasn’t Right. It’s odd how it felt like friends with benefits. A brief period of extended friendship and being cared for. I didn’t really feel the pain or the hurt, I don’t think we ever reached the hurting stage? I do miss you though, I miss you for all the little crazy things you’d do, we’d do.  I have so many stories to tell you…things about how I’m doing now and how great things are going. Things I know would make you really proud of me, about standing up and standing tall. Still no treatment although I’ve started to heal mentally though, fuck the physical eh? I’ll deal with it later..:P  I took that drive again for a sorority meet and thought of you. Right down government on daulphin too. Those were some crazy ass times weren’t they?  Damn Snake. :P  Take care you.     urlLink  "So I feel like a big bucket of stupid now. But at least I'm a happy big bucket of stupid."

      How is it that Lucky Charms have  less calories  than Golden Grahams?  I’m being psychotically obsessive again; analyzing the back of packages while stocking up at my weekly three-in-the-morning wal*mart binges. I have little packets of cereal, lots of soup, yogurt and more fat-free light shit of any kind plus a good load of poptarts to suffice my cravings.  And that, is my basic diet really.   Oh and orange juice. The pulp-y kind + coffee.  :)  Somehow my body doesn’t like Real food, or Real products. The eggs, the meat, the proteins, the fucking carbohydrates only go in to come back out the wrong way later.   You’re  talking to  reading manic Racheal now.  The girl that goes to the gym with the ex and his ex who is the current squeeze and with ‘boyfriend of the week’ in tow at the crack of dawn with ‘my ass if falling out! my ass is falling out!’ pants.  The one that sings loud cheesy pop music while driving down long, long depressive curvy roads to get back to the next state/home/porn shop.  She’s also the one that acts like a bitch and expects everyone to regally bow down at her. Hell yeah, you ass, grovel.  She’s the colder, meaner side of what it means to live in this head, to put up with that depressive whiny annoying bitch. She is the side that says so fucking what?  The one that will damn bloody well kiss a girl if she wants to and not beat herself up for being the way she is. The one that is proud and confident, that smiles, laughs and yells at the same time, the girl that makes three leaf clovers with her tongue and makes silly faces.  She’s a bitch and I really should hate her but you know what, I think I’ll just keep her around.  Crazy turd.  All this early morning fat fighting blood flowing-boosting workout makes me hyper.  Hmm.     urlLink "Bwhahhahahahahahaha. That was fun ;) "

      You look at me as if I could be so many things to you and I tell you to stop staring and laugh uncomfortably as your eyes look deep again into mine. You reach out to push the stranded pieces of hair around my face, another excuse just to touch me you say, and you tell me again how incredibly turned on you are by my glasses. You call me sexy from across the floor and I answer to beautiful.  You twist and twirl me around, dancing in beat to the rhythm that pounds through this place. The glasses have come off and out emerges the girl that everyone’s used to. At least here in the Real world anyway, that confident bitchy chick. I have on this low cut slinky black dress, yes, more black and another dress, another outfit. The girl is layered with white and black, then white then black again…strappy silver stilettos and a necklace that fits just right and almost becomes a part of me. My make up after twenty hours in the bathroom is finally right, smudged and applied on as you periodically came in and putzed around, as you put your arms around my waist and I giggled as your lips kissed my neck and slowed me down some more.  We sit by the steps at the American Legion and we share lights as we take a breather from all of the craziness going on inside. You pick up the bill when I am not looking and steal kisses in the rain, you laugh when it hurts and your face scrunches up when you’re angry.  I come home to you and we get past the door to a whole new world inside. I let you hold my hand and lead me to some place else. I trust you though my trust is questionable in itself.  I let your fingers trace my bones and your palm rub my back. Your toes meet mine at the foot of the bed as you slip deep into me and I moan. I moan with pleasure, with pain, with uncertaintity. I moan with escalating desire and scream with lust. Like slapping my ass and fingernails scratching your back; how can this feel so right and so wrong at the same time?   Hours slip by and soon the fifth disc in the changer is playing as sleep slowly consumes me and I smile to myself as your arms wrap around me tighter in that very second. We get underneath the covers and soon, exhausted and orgasm worn out, fall fast asleep.  It’s funny how eating twisted Fritos and listening to Jimmy Eat World can bring back such odd memories.    urlLink  "Your sweet sweet skin lingers on my mind. Your laughing voice tickles as it tortures. The glint of streetlight off the corner of your eyes as I fuck you lights the way. Your tits warp my vision, my view bending to suit the curves of your innocent flesh. Your taut face, stretched in a grimace of pleasure, mouth agape, throat muscles corded and trembling with passionate anticipation of the next moment. Your hips slide and thrust in thirst for each and every inch of cock. Your belly, warm and smooth, rubs and rubs and tickles mine. I get lost between your tongue in my mouth and my dick in your cunt. My hand on your back. My hand on your throat. The hissing draw of breath inbetween thrusts. The desperation of our embrace mirroring the vulnerability of our passion. Our legs intwined, our fuck fast or slow, our scratching or clasping, our kisses voracious or tender, in and out - in and out - in and in.  I thought I was lost until I found myself in you. I never spent a moment so happy as the one I lived losing myself in you."

       "...it was a beautiful shoot, marc....... ....................it was honest, it was deliberate, it was Real."  It was that, love. It was that.  And "the others"? ...welll  Just as important, sweetheart.  You see  It seems to me that no one picture tells the story. As soon as the shutter clicks, another story gets told. And I have to save that one, too.  Some stories are sad...some thoughtful, contemplative. Some are cute, sexy moments of getting caught in your bra, biting a nail, and looking up with that all-too-adorable grin that says your titilated, but self-consciously embarrassed at being "naughty" - a word that even sounds naughty. Some are confident, strong, independent. Some are just plain bitchy. Some are silly. Some are playful.  They are ALL -- you.  Some say "I'm sad." Some say "I'm happy." Some say "I'm too fat." Some say "Do I have a nice ass or what?" Some say "My tits are too small." Some say "Fuck you - they're MY tits, and I'm proud of them." Some say "This is one of my best friends in the whole world." Some say "I'm bored." Some say "My photographer is SO DAMN clever." Some say "The Old Guy with the camera is an idiot." Some say "I wish..." Some say "I hope..." Some say "I AM."  The thing is...  They all say:  "I'm Racheal."  Two hundred, twenty-five pieces of a puzzle I still haven't completely fit together. I don't think I ever will. For you see, I've noticed something.  The puzzle keeps changing.  Every time you think you've just about got it all together... Something's not cut to fit. And you have to start over. Or back up, at least.  Take more pictures.  Tell more stories.  Fit a few more pieces in.  But that's just the way Life is, isn't it?  A step forward. A step back. Shuffle to the side.  Pick up a piece, and snap it into place.  It's frustrating, I know.  But the thing is  It IS worth it.  Because, for all of the boredom and bullshit...  Every once in a while...  A piece just slides into place.  And you step back, and have this epiphany.  "That's what that is!!!"  (click)   I’ve always wondered…sometimes with purpose, sometimes just because and sometimes even against my will; what did I do that was so wrong, so right, never loved, so damn adorable and so strong sometimes?  Why have I become a puzzle filled with a million pieces, a tale with a million sides. Songs.  Why does the music only play in my mind and when I trace, only changed much later. Or right now. Or a while more?  How do I become hot then cold, furious then angry, obsolete then saddened, disappointed then heartbroken? How do I manage this existence of hiding then letting go, giving up then moving forward, giving in then breaking down?  Why am I, over millions and millions of people, the one that gets sick, the one that’s fucked up, the one that’s so damn sensitive to things around her? Why am I tired when I’m not done yet, happy when I was sad just a moment ago and dysfunctionally perfect. Why do my flaws make me special, and my idiosyncracies make me wanted?  Why don’t I have size 48 DD breasts with long blonde hair and blue eyes? Why is the other person always better and more beautiful? Why do I berate the person in the mirror and let the voices control me?  Why am I so weak and stupid?  Why do I question so damn fucking much?  Because I can, that’s why.  Because Eve let us into the garden of Knowledge.  Because Pandora opened her damn box.  Because I have a brain and it’s working harder than it probably should.  Because I’m racheal, and this is what being "racheal" is.  This is what loving racheal means.  Because it's four in the morning and I'm good at analyzing shit like that.  Or so I'd like to think.

      i sit here sipping chickenless chicken soup and i log in periodically into my server. internal error-'cannot find server', it's been acting up the last couple of days. in some sense, it really does feel like a child to me, the constant need to be cajoled and taken care of...or how it sits pathetically when i go through binges of being so sick of the internet world and avoid it.  i don't know how i feel about my new layout; perhaps that is the beauty of it. that i am undecided if it is too much or just right.   i remember that shoot though, the selection of pictures i have chosen to put up and not put up have to a certain extent been deliberately done so. i am not completely stripped as per say but a lot of times, i feel as if my soul is raped in here. as if i have unlayered and am completely bare; my thoughts, my wants, my needs.  i remember crying and breaking down. being stuck in a corner in darkness and music played just right, just enough to capture the moments. evoked just painfully enough to snap the series of breaking down.  it was a beautiful shoot, marc.  it was honest, it was deliberate, it was Real.  and that's what i loved most of all about it.  ...now the others are well, questionable.  :)  perhaps i'll put together the portfolio and actually upload it later.  we'll see.    urlLink  "I'll eventually get a wild hair up my ass and feel the need to write more.

      The three year old that runs around in her half falling diapers chased around by the maid that cusses in the foreign language and laughs at the same time. She is cheeky and extremely playful, energized and never sleeps. Thumb sucker and independent, no pussy ass pacifiers for her she says, she colors the world in bright beautiful hues of every damn kalaedoscopic color and strives to be just like her older brother. The cool one yet she fights him to death and pulls his hair and torments him rightfully just like a little sister should. But late at night when she says her prayers, she thanks god for mommy and daddy and yes, even that idiot.  Smart ass.  ---  Fourteen: Belligerent and still opinionated. Still a little girl at heart thrown into a world of hormones and indecision. Too little hours in a day she splits between her different worlds. The entertainment industry that sucks her in and matures her indefinitely, scars her for life yet teaches her all these valuable lessons. The pretend world she lives for the ones around her that thinks she’s always in control, always happy, absolutely beautiful. And the one she keeps to herself, the spiraling depressive bitch that tears herself apart and abuses her already tormented body. The suicidal girl that deals with all the diseases that inflict her already broken body, she scratches her nails and feels the pain of it being ripped off as she injects brutal force into it.  Angry at the world, she deals with the world around through mediums. Discovers herself and the people around her, she learns the ultimate lesson on Life.  ---  Seventeen and burned out. She gets back in schedule of the Normal life. The preppy girl, captain of the cheerleaders, the one that fucks with all the rules in school and still manages to suck face with the teachers. The prefect, the one that always gets away with marking her independence and screwing the uniforms. The ones around her with a cult like obsession, the ones in her clique fuck around with each others minds, the smart lost ones. She is calm, calm, calm but curious. Still questioning, dabbles her foot back into the industry and can’t decide if she’ll stay or not.  Has people wait on her hand foot, craves on the control…the power. Her dark abusive rituals have become more apparent now, four years of eating disorders and depression becomes obvious after a while. always excused after a meal or doesn’t eat at all. She writes away her pain and finds herself. Constantly searching for herself, the being she is, can be, will be.  Graduates and tries to be like the rest of them but she’s never been Normal. And this time she appreciates it. Her difference gets her into clubs, gets her on lists and takes her places. Her difference gives her the nice car she drives and the fucking fantastic clothes she gets, her difference makes it a perfectly reasonable excuse for the person she is. She accepts.  ---  Eighteen. All the things they have drilled into her is finally beginning to make sense. She can now look in the mirror and not want to smash something against it, she can look at pictures and not tear it apart. She still has to silence the harsh whispers though, she still has to tell herself to shut up and take a break.  Set backs propel her forward, tumors invade but she stands back tall and strong and says fuck that.  She’s changed and changing…everyday still goes through fast like the rollercoaster. Up and down, up and down, down and slow in anticipation of the highs, and high and afraid in preparation for the lows.  People still come and go in her life. Love fills around her and invites her into a different realm. She breathes with life and dances to her own, drums to her own beat. The difficult persistent ones stay, but those are the friends for life. Thick and thin, weak and strong, she grabs on and laughs as she slides down this ride…but it is only what it is, just another ride.  She smiles at the girl that looks back at her and knows things will be right. Her ending is still unchartered, her life still in threads…she doesn’t know when the day will come, or how it will; but she prepares the best she can.  She lives.  She smiles.

       urlLink http://agedandconfused.com  I watch you reach out to thin air and cry. I watch the tears bleed out and the broken smithereens of your heart in your hands; and for a moment I wish I had all the right things to say, I wish I could hold you in my arms and make you feel safe a while, I’d listen to your screams and tell you it’d be okay…and I’ll do all the things the others do for me and tell you,  urlLink  “hold my hand little girl, we’ll fly away.”     Or at least try to.    urlLink http://karac.com  You hide your pain with a cynical mask somewhere amidst the broken lonely girl. You call us the Internet whores, the fake people. Designed, instigated and filled with putrid thoughts, but what you don’t see or perhaps understand a whole deeper more is that we are real too. Still people. Still human, still with feelings. Feelings to love, to care, to understand, to hurt. And we are still Real.  If only you’d understand.    urlLink http://karac.com/~jared  I am your whore, your slut, your bitch. I am the girl that can’t keep her legs together and fucks you over from time to time. But what you forget, is that I am still all the things you once saw in me, I am still her yet maybe you never knew me at all. I can take this abuse, and I can hurt a while but with every break grows a stronger child, with every beating comes a bigger resolution. So tear me down, so cuss me out, so yell, scream and hit me again with the words you use so well and when all is over, rest.    urlLink http://brickchick.net  You question the hands of fate. You analyze the importance and value Love is to you…is it worth it? Is he the one? Can this be it? You ask again, unsure…scraping on this surface of obscure existence. What are the answers? Is this love? Do I love him? Will we make it? I don’t know honey, but Try.    urlLink http://jasmine.blogspot.com  You avoid the rest of the world and hide. I’ve seen you take the back step, find your way in the world again. You mask yourself with being cold and callous, but I still see her. I still hear you break sometimes in the middle of the night, you want to know how long more he’ll wait. If love transgresses all things…you move on then come back again but know you are better each time.  twenty one years.    urlLink http://racheal.thewarmcompany.com  You pass judgement on others…but I see you too in the middle of the night. When your insomniac mind questions and questions and tears your being apart. You put little steps in to endeavour into that world called Love again, but with every good potential try you push away. You smile and arrogantly dismiss them all, twirl around and dance to your own little tune. You work all these problems and fix them with a little bit more than superglue and some tape…and then you remember that if you can’t duct it, fuck it. Your sorry little roaming ass heals, yet you still fall down into this foray of darkness whenever you get tired of the world. Outside, behind/beyond these four walls lies Life. You aren’t the only one screwed.  Choose your poison and Live it.  Hope.

      I sit here trying to figure out why this end seems so familiar. An almost suffocating dejavu like existence; I threw up tonight. all that I had been going for, all that I had worked on came crashing down after the game.  The  game.  Victory is always sweet,  we  got the stick, big guy. Artistic impression, foam thrown together, ideas clashing, blue+green+yellow hues for the last couple of hours have proved themselves, big winners in the end. Strong competitors. Empty existence of a non-energized fuel. Hit the delete. Hit the delete. Delete.  Rolls and rolls of pictures. But  urlLink this series  hurts the most. I remember all that was felt in that moment; crouching, reaching out to hold him yet defensive…crying and letting go at the same time. Knowing that within those four walls I might have been safe yet still sucking it in, only the betrayal of random teardrops that escaped my eyes.  Spotlight that shone through the blinds, created light in the complete utter darkness. Deafening silence only intruded by your shutter speed clicking against the torturous melancholic crap I’ve played. Now who the hell needs inspiration when sadness is my forte?  Fell asleep out of pure utter exhaustion, all the sobbing in a day plus the onslaught of aneroxic attacks I feel coming on…or have they came already? I can’t tell anymore. The fidgeting from absolutely no nicotine in the system, caffeine and gum with that damn perky bitch boinking up, down and around running through aisles and aisles of restocked crap in wal*mart and playing in the ice rain. Not snow, not salt, but ice rain. In fucking Florida.   Home now. Safe in the confines of this room I have come to know well, sleep is almost foreign now. Insomnia is my best friend as I tear apart and recreate this place again, reaching out to tell you I’ll be the fuck okay because I know you’ll catch me if I’ll fall. Because I know it’s okay to fall.  The therapist wants me to make that list: things I like about myself.   I’ll get there…eventually. I think of a couple than laugh myself silly, who am I kidding? To feel so confident and insecure at the same time is a bitch, but at least I’ve stopped crying now and sucked it in.   At least I’m stronger now…making it.  Watch me.  Watch me.  I’ll make you so fucking proud.     urlLink  "This whole thing started because the Muse has a problem with her "Delete" button - she refuses to use the damn thing. So she's all in a blue funk, calling me at odd hours, as if a smiley-faced waffle is the Great Balm of Life."

      I wake up to lips on my forehead and someone lying beside me...holding me.  He smiles as I turn over and he rubs my back. We make love, bare skin on bare skin, yet it is without words. Without sounds.  He looks deep into my soul and sees Beauty, he believes in me. I don't need to question, I feel.  Draws me in close and I weep like a little child.   I sob, and hurt, and shed more and more faces. Facades. I tell him I can be so many things, that I have so many dreams and I scrape and scrape on hard rock cliffs barely hanging on, climbing back up. Trying.  I cry out to all that is within and around me and tell him I want to give up so bad.   ....and then I rub dreams away from my eyes.  Outside, raindrops are falling, invading this barren winter earth and cascading it into life.   It is a good forty degrees or less;   i'm layered up and ready to go again.  Fuck you world, I'll sail my ship alone.

      Fear grips me as blood rushes to my head and my jaw drops open: yell, scream, anything at all but nothing audible is heard, just my vocal chords going against the panic, near hysteria in my mind. My stomach in big giant knots, I feel like I’m about to throw up and pass out at the same time…only gripping tighter. Gripping so tight my knuckles aren’t even white anymore, I taste the salty streams running from my eyes but I don’t remember crying.  And there it goes again, another gunshot.  A loud deep rumbling    BOOM   I want to step on the gas and run every red light that stops me, I am too afraid to curse the long dark winding roads, and attempt to just focus on going home safely. Out of nowhere, it comes, and I am screaming and screaming and I cannot stop.  The harsh glow across my dashboard tells me it is a quarter to two. I pray right there and then for a cop, for some highway patrol person, for Lillian Highway to cross Bauer  Now.   Two pairs of headlights behind me; Was it them? Are they tailing me?    What the fuck is going on?   I ring him and I am yelling, crying and not saying a single solitary word that makes sense at all. He yells with me, 911 on the other hand…what the fuck is going on?  I am afraid to turn, afraid they are following me. The pain so much more worst tonight, my medication sits rotting away by my bedside drawer…I honestly do not know what to do.  I tell the other dad to meet me outside. It’s two in the morning, what the fuck is happening?  I run in and scream and pass out at the same time. He makes me take my pills and get a shot of steroids, my bloodstream is fucked over but I am finally calm. Breathing.    “It’s all going to be okay Racheal, you’re safe now..it’s alright honey.”   No I’m not.  No I’m not.  I’m scared.  …..I  want  to  go  home  Now.

       urlLink Tears In Heaven – Racheal  ‘Out of Tune and Bored’  Khong   This is kinda silly…but significant I suppose?  My dad used to play ‘Tears In Heaven’ for me when I was little, and we’d sing it together...I miss my dad? :(   For some odd reason (boredom most probably) Amanda and I decided we needed a break from our mundane studying shit and so, loaded up on caffeine and math formulas, we went and made our own entertainment. Cracking ourselves up with the karaoke booths at the mall then laughing ourselves silly with ice-cream and whaddya know, more coffee!.  :)  Unfortunately, she won’t let me upload her fuckingly good voice but let me tell you, DAMN that girl can sing!  Lol, other than the constant  'now how the hell does this go again?'  plus crazy ass very audible jitters, I had fun. I have to say though that next to that woman I’m like the squeaking rat. Hehe. So if it’s god awful and cracks your windows…I told you so! (sorry)   urlLink ‘Stay’  had a lot of weird chokes and laughs in it too because well, it  is  a damn mall and we had to record it in one go….we being the two screaming high semi claustrophobic girls together…justified my picture yet?  Hmm…bet you didn’t know my voice was so manly eh? The alto against the descant, smart move innit?  :P  In other news though, guess what I found when I came home?  One fucking dozen roses…Wa wa wa wa!  Thank you Terence! Whoop. Whoop.  Hehe, yes, being Thai is good indeed.  It has been an amazing week…well somewhat anyway. Like for all the bad moments I’ve had, all the little ones like this have made up for it you know? or something to that effect anyway..  Cast read-through tomorrow. I’m so excited I think I might piss in my pants!  Baby got the role homeboy…  Hell fucking Yeah!  :P   P/s I had a long ass talk with God today, got some shit settled so it was nice. Now what do you have to say to that,  urlLink the Wrong Reverend ?    urlLink  " 'It's a bagel,' she said. "    I want a scone. No, I mean a Real Scone.  gah.

      I have a couple of threads in my bag…  One being about the shuttle disaster and the other about this whole loving myself business and getting better crap…which for some reason tonight, feels just like what it is, indecisive crap racheal spurts out through her ass once in a while.  School has been insanely and tremendously taxing the last whole week. I honestly swear I spent at least eight hours in school yesterday in classes and studying, figuring out the language that I am apparently supposed to be good at but have been struggling with. I hate to fail, I hate getting a B when I damn bloody well know I can get that A. Damn word problems I tell you, damn metric system.   We had to go for this speech by Leonard Pitts at the auditorium last night in conjunction with the Black History month for extra credit. (Ten extra points? hell yeah baby!)   I scribbled down a lot of worthy quotes amidst all the other notes I had to take to get my paper done…I guess a part of me has always realized how important color was to this world but not really quite as bad as it hit me last night.  I am Asian, and I am proud to be. I dish it out almost quite as much as I get it, I’ve learn to laugh about it mostly, if only just because, I have to accept the fact that people are ignorant sometimes. I cannot control the person that judges me just because of who I am before looking into  who  I am. I cannot help it if someone thinks I am only good at making clothes or making ‘flied lice’ if only because that’s all that they have been exposed to.  But what I can do is smile when I feel like slapping the shit out of someone that takes me down just because I am yellow. Turn around and face the other way when someone decides that I am not smart enough, good enough or intellectual enough just because Malaysia is a third world country. I believe in karma, and I believe that actions always speak louder than words.  The only thing I really didn’t quite agree with last night was when my generation was referred to as the  valueless generation.  Somehow, even with all the bullshit and rubbish “my generation” comes out with…it still seems acceptable. It’s sad nonetheless but if only those condescending critical eyes would see the beautiful people I meet everyday. The people from my era that have accepted me and supported me for just as I am.  Loved me.  Then maybe they’d understand why I take offense to that…because contrary to that, I think we still have our values.  Anne Frank said a long time ago,   “In spite of everything, I still believe people have a good heart,”  and it’s still true isn’t it?     urlLink  "eh, it's something to hope for."

       "I'm changing my name to "Frosted Cheerios" in the morning..."   Dumbass.  :P  so I turned down this extremely yummilicious ass today…and I’m sitting here trying to figure out why the hell I did that and I’m drawing a very sorry blank.  I swear confidence or at least this sorta happy/whoop-de-doop the world is so perfect attitude attracts people…which doesn’t really make a lot of sense if you think about it?  Why? Why when I’ve sworn off my rights and declared celibacy…WHY?!  Hehe.  Oh well.   I think there might really be seriously something wrong with me though…I’m normally very fascinated by the whole romance, sweet-talking, gentlemanly crap but now it all just seems irritating. It’s as if something in me just really can’t stand it and I just want to yank my hair out and scream, stay on that side you idiots! Leave me alone….i can appreciate it now!  Gah.  Tired as fuck…spent a good portion of today studying and in classes then had to go to some event for extra credit. It was fun but I’m much much too incoherent to analyze it now. (we have to do a write up for it) Back to back coffee load up in racheal’s system is bad…you’d think I would’ve had known it by now eh?  In other news though, I’m going to take a nice long, long, hot bubble bath.  Excuse the Bitch.  My bones/muscles are aching…and it’s Tuesday tomorrow too..  Damn.  Dah-yum.  Must.   Get.   Fit.

       The world waits, wings arched…perched just above a very thin ledge. Obscure + waiting…peacefully serene; calmness and confidence needed to take flight, to soar above.  Mission launched, then aborted, then fought back and launched again. Guiding over tall peaked twin escalades, a bid into the future. A signature of feminine strength, vitality…it ages along the years. Wiser yet dethroned: dancing spirals of steam creates atmosphere, stirring…an oblivion into the world unknown. I wait.  Desires give birth to dreams. Slightly stronger with every backstep, trip?pun intended: it is a fall and a journey together.  Gorgeous divine implications, a bruised knee scraped creates blood flow and heals.  ReBirth.   I feel like an inferno champion.    in·fer·no ( n-f? n )n. pl. in·fer·nos 1.	A place or condition suggestive of hell, especially with respect to human suffering or death: the inferno of battle. 2.	A place of fiery heat or destruction.      We went to the Pilots game tonight…very, very interesting. I swear there is absolutely nothing like caffeine/booze fueled loud cheering fans and violent anger management needed players on the ice. Fun, fun, fun!! I might have lost my voice and a good chunk of my hair from the shoot out and nerves, but shit yeah it was worth it.   Whoop. Whoop.  Besides, there was skating afterwards and landing on my ass is always amusing…you know they don’t call me Grace for nothing eh?  And for god’s sake, I’m all about this whole Beautiful, love-yourself shit but damn, just how many times can you rotate that song on your airwaves in an hour? I swear I have reached a point where I will seriously scream and stick my fingers up my ass if I have to listen to it again. And again. And what the hell, just one more time cause we can huh?  Someone kill me if you find me still humming that song. Good song though, and like every other pop song out there, true dat.  I should probably go to hell for eating pop tarts at this hour but oh well, I’m hungry. Hah. And contrary to popular belief, no, the hotdogs at games is not quite edible at all. It was cute though, he offered to go over to Copelands and get me real food. Lol. High maintenance bitch.  I’m sorry, I just have class.  …says the idiot in a big old tattered t-shirt munching on her cold pop tart.  Yeah.  Uhuh.  Whatever, woman.  Bulimic manic depressive retard.  Classy indeed innit?  And just for the record and future references, I’m stronger than a stick of no good tobacco thank you very much.  …as she twitches and pops in another Tylenol.  Gah.  Withdrawal symptoms: ooh fun!  Just you wait for the bitch to come out?evil snicker *  Okay, time to get back into the strait jacket.   p/s yes, I did realize how ungodly long and obscene the last whine/rant was but yeah,  my  space! :P    urlLink  "how do you say high priest sex god from heaven?

      You see, the beautiful thing about the Internet is that somehow, the world seems so much smaller in here.  At last count, twenty four emails from strangers after that last ‘happy’ post…   I sit here wondering how so many days, weeks have melted into such a period of time; a spiraling depression that apparently no one but me could take out of this rut. The long whining nights, the early dawn phone calls, the running of tears and continuing sobs that rang through the night, hid through the day. Why have I been so sad? How is it that I have been so dysfunctional and not really realized it?  I didn’t phantom how much me as a complete and whole person affected others? I didn’t realize how critical and vicious the voices in my head were…how easily rectifiable this problem was. Listen, Understand then Learn.  I owe an apology to anyone that reads this site, I haven’t been much of me lately. That stinking depressive blinded bitch…I shot you down, one after the other each and every time you tried. Protecting, as if guarding from Hurt again only to understand that I had confined myself in wraths of wretched Pain all on my own.  I am soothed by the chanting, flowing sounds of sigur ros…it feels like an emotional journey down some lane. The lane of the Unknown.   Life?  Put in a trance of solitude, nothing can go wrong today…this week…anymore. It’s not if I am saying I’m never going to feel shitty again, but rather it would be a manageable amount of shittiness. I just never want to fall so far down no one can reach me again, or I can’t reach them.  Loneliness is a terrible torture. I don’t need to be alone, I just choose to be most of the time.  “Loneliness and being Alone are two different things sweetheart,”  Are they? Somehow, I must have mixed them up. See I figured as long as I didn’t get into a relationship then I couldn’t hurt anyone and no one could hurt me…never ever have I been so wrong before. I crave for that touch, for that emotional bond unsevered….I crave for someone to wake up to, and someone to fall asleep by my side. I realize how perfectly easy that would be to fix that but I hate that one night stand shit, and these people that I’ve been dating? I don’t know, it’s hard to grow close to someone and not want to let them go, not want to take the next step.  (Of course all he thinks is that I just need to get laid.)  but it isn’t that.  I wish I could be comfortable enough in my skin and it wouldn’t have to be a face. I know I am all these wonderful unique things, it isn’t as if I don’t see it but sometimes it just gets hard to believe that shit. When the voice you’ve been listening to all this while shouts above all others and controls you. That voice is embedded in you, without it you are lost and too emotional. Without that voice, you have no common sense or ration, and so you keep it around. Silencing it when you need to yet always submitting to it.  The fight back up is a difficult one. Shut up Voice, person, whoever you are. I am beautiful, and I am enough. I am all the things that is enough to be a precious stone, just unhoned yet. Just need to be worked on but some day I will be all the things you told me I never could be.  I’m on the Honors program, and your little voice that told me I was stupid, dumb and undisciplined can go to hell because I made it. All on my own I studied and worked on, my very own self…I did it on my own.  Casted for the leading part, when your loud voice boomed in my head what an untalented ugly whore I was. Pinpointed all the little things during the audition and making me feel so much smaller, so insecure about the rest of the world. You laughed and cackled when I told you of my dreams, when I said that I could make it. Without Drew around you said I was pointless, no one to organize things for me but I did it on my own two feet and I will damn bloody well stand tall and proud.  You said no one would ever love me. That I was undeserving of love, tainted, ugly and disgusting. You told me I would never be worth it or enough and I wonder if you ever knew me at all. Voice, I believed for so long that you knew me best and was blinded to the fact that I was a somebody. When they came in succession, I pushed them away because I didn’t want them to see the inside me…not knowing that they had already seen things in me I never acknowledged. You taught me to let my prejudices push away love, that Love was bad and evil.   Five months and sixteen days. You said I wouldn’t survive, that my spoiled little fat behind wouldn’t make it with having to go without my car, without the maids, without my friends, and without the doting parents. You said my sorry ass would come home the next month and I did want to but this equally fat and equally stubborn behind persevered and here I am, almost reaching six months and counting. I learned to do dishes and laundry, I learned that cooking was very good therapy and have been closer to my parents than I have ever been in the last eighteen years.   You called me a mutt. A breeding of sorts and made me feel less important. Cultureless as if I had no homage. But then it took me a while to realize it only gave me character, somebody to be proud of. I hid away and didn’t like speaking, being made fun of because I felt so different, not realizing that this difference was what made me so special. Just me. It wasn’t that they didn’t accept me, that the harsh cruel eyes the world I thought I lived in that tore me down but it was me that wouldn’t, wouldn’t accept or love me just because.  Yet I thank you Voice. I thank you because you’ve pushed me further than I would have ever gone. You challenged the boundaries and scraped beneath skin to get me to the core. You brought me real people, friends that had to go through shit to be a Friend. You showed me things I could fix and made me god damn bloody well fix them and wouldn’t get off my back. You let me enjoy many beautiful places whenever you suffocated me so much I had to run, get away from everything. You taught me about late night telly and how calm the bay was at night with the bright of the stars reflecting off the water.   I know you haven’t left yet, I know your loud, obscene, criticizing voice is still somewhere around but it’s really okay. I don’t need to change everything about me just cause you say so, I just need to accept me. Then I’ll understand and grasp fully the love me or leave me concept.  I don’t need to be afraid of Honesty. It’s really not such a bad thing is it?  And for once you know I am Right.     “In three words, I can sum up everything I’ve learned about life.  It goes on. ”

      The bitch got Thai!  Wahahahahahah…!!!  Leading female lady ; uhuh, uhuh, *breaks off to song and dance *   The callback apparently wasn’t really a callback but rather a test on reliability. Nothing like the sweet ass grin I carried for the rest of the evening when director dude said, ‘welcome on board!’  Heeheehee. I’m feeling pretty darn good about myself now it’s scary…I spent the rest of the day first trying to muster down as much lunch as we could before the thing, then studying some at the coffee place before we went back to lesbian lover’s place and got ready.  She dressed me up in this little white dress with sparkly butterflies on them complete with stilettos and shit. It was interesting…but damn that dress was short. Hell, you try swing dancing in some heels and a short ass skirt….helppp! : )  Marc took  me  manic panicked racheal out this morning too..there is absolutely nothing like bitching the first thing in the morning and ‘getting it all out’. Working aimlessly at a monologue that in the end had no significance at all seeing as the cast had already been decided. Oh Well. No complaints here!  I sit across, looking at her. She is beautiful. Straight....pity innit?  The boys ask for my hand and dance with me, throwing me around and forcefully. Coordinated, as if almost a farce on it’s own…we move in synchronity, bop to the beat and smile, laugh, smile.  Freaked out at the other coffee place, my little punk rocker hang out. Watched the live set for a few minutes or so and contemplated between moshing or shuffling a deck of cards…Both equally torturous.  Ladies night at the club next door…somehow dragged in and it is military plus galore. Coerced into dancing and being bought drinks off the table, as if fresh blood has entered this den. Remain courteous and smiley awhile before excusing myself ever so politely to leave.   Woman in control. The girlfriend holds the mind but I hold the keys.  We drive for much passion must have been felt. We fall back into supper with good friends and partners in crime. Reminding me again, what a beautiful world I live in.  “I’m quite a rascal ain’t I?”  Home at last, tired as shit but happy like a saint.  Time for bed!  whoop. whoop.  ZZZzZzzzz

      she wrote the note in a haze of confusion, lost, blinded...searching i suppose. hoping to reach out.   she's thinking about taking this down again, it's becoming redundant and she thinks she needs change...or at least a break a while. she's gotten too used to falling into depressive states and writing things off in a non committal way...she's thinking she needs to live in the real world a while. experience the consequences and strengthen her actions.   actions speak louder than words   an afternoon with herself and the old man. a special gift. thank you you.

      he writes to tell her he has ears to listen to her a while, a heart to sympathize and a mind to rationalize with her. and she is touched.   thank you.  how are things? i don't know. how's the boy? i don't know. how's your life? i don't know. how's your mind? i don't know.  i think i started crying on wednesday was it? i don't remember now, the days just mesh together and become one long overdrawn hour, that invisible hour of desperation, the hopeless hour of darkness, the emptiness of a moment.   and she weeps.   alone.  pillow to chest clinged tightly, curled into a ball...and the strangers are outside, the voices inside. shut up a while head, be still a while heart.   she's lost daddy, and no one can find her. she's stuck in a maze she's crafted on her own, of dead ends and never ending roads, strides into never never land. she's broken her wings.  the girl in the mirror laughs at her, she sees the tears in her eyes, feels the wet streams down her cheek..cries again, but all is trite now. old.   redundant, her diseases bind her; locks her in a destructive cycle. she cannot get up, cannot get out. she cannot find her way...would you help her please?  she's dying.  frustrated, agonized, disappointed with herself. so amny things surround her and pressures. she has no answers. solutions.  she's sick again. her demons grow rampant, her dragon burns.   tormented.  alone.  by choice...don't bring anyone down with you.  she's leaving.  she walks away.  ...lingering smell of fresh roses in her car, unanswered messages, invisible man.  she hides.

      the term comes around and things finally begin to fall into place. of ups and downs, highs and lows, a certain tranquility finally washes over...though not quite in the middle nor in between, it is a limbo that flows fluidly, gently this time. of finally learning to tug harder, or softer, scream louder or whisper, push harder or take a breather and though things still worry and frustrate me at the same time, there's a sorta peace that underlies it all and that is kinda nice.  my budget is out of whack again with the home phone being added to my bill. somehow, i was very slyly conned into that one and am now paying a bulk of the calls. because we are separated by about three miserable miles, all my calls are mostly state-to-state and hence, long distance charges. painful, painful, charges. i've been trying to keep my international calls in check but the pensacola calls just take a beating then...it feels like a see-saw sometimes, one or the other...though i'm getting smarter about it so yeah, takes time i suppose. every bloody thing takes time. gah.  met up with marlene and a bunch of the other girls to watch the dance explosion downtown and it was good. albeit entertaining but definitely memorable. oddly enough, i got a phonecall today about another indie movie then got offered by dominique to do the vocals on his next project. electronic clash something or another he was explaining, but considering this afternoon's drinking binge and the wine we had during dinner...quite a bit flew past my head.   :P  tentatively, as it stands right now, i might or might not move in with marlene. apparently, i have to put together a 'business proposal' for my dad. what living outside involves, promises, health shit, budgeting, drama, school and the person i'm going to live with. there is a lot of pressure on myself to straighten out my life and to get out of the desperate pathetic route i've taken the last couple of months and to basically, 'get my shit together'.   i get so pissed sometimes, at myself, because i haven't really mastered the 'real world' techniques of being independent and it frustrates me to the bone. i can get there mentally but physical crap from being a real spoilt brat my whole life just bugs me. all the trivial miniscule details you have to look into, separate the whites and colored, how the fuck do you slice beef?, checkbook has to balance, utillity/cellphone/phone/school/lunch/going out budgets, i hate being dictated by all these stupid things. i suppose the immature part of me still needs to learn about these things and it gets sorta overwhelming at times.   i wonder if i'll get back to that routine this summer. and have to readjust again.   "i want my fucking car. the damn maids. my parents. and not have to worry about money." - now, that would be the brat in me. though the other part says, i want to be independent. i want to work this summer and make my own money, iron my own clothes (hah!), open my own account and budget the bitch out of me so i'll grow up. so i'll stop messing up. so i'll be ready for the world eh?  he rang earlier from work...it was really nice. shit, it made me giggly and plastered a smile the size of texas on my face. and no, it wasn't just the alcohol. there's something very special about knowing you're the one he rings, or that he cared enough. bothered to. there's something very special about being attracted to someone that is attracted to you and sharing that bond. i feel like i'm rediscovering this, understanding from what's beneath skin deep and learning about this again. being wary yet at the same time allowing myself to feel this, to be honest with myself. to know there are issues and there are problems but also to understand that there are solutions and there is such a thing as working it out together.   so if things don't work out...then they don't. big fucking deal. if my heart gets smashed, pulped, twisted again...so be it. i'm stronger, different, changed and all that now...but it isn't too bad. i like who i am, i like the person i'm becoming...and whether he helps me shape up to be that person or forces me into it..i don't know. but he's here now, and he's in my life some way or the other and that isn't up to me.   i've come to realize, my head and my heart are entirely separate divisions and so i can think this to death and yet my heart will still have other opinions. so yeah..  life.   i'll be alright i suppose.  :)

      she came in to take things down, but right at she signed on he sent her a message saying he'd just read through it all. he wanted to talk things through, to work things out. perhaps, maybe, i don't know was the question of the day as it'd been a while.   lets talk. lets hang out he says. lets try and work this through, lets give us a chance, lets figure this through together.   being away from her he says has not been good. he says, he figures, he thinks, thinking is evil. thinking hurts.   then she launches into a cascade of a million thoughts unpolished, unrehearsed and so everything comes out in a confusing mess. things are left hanging in the air and words pieced together weirdly, choice of sentences kinda screwy but she needs to lay her cards. she needs to be honest with how she feels so he'll be honest with her. so it's fair game, so they strip off notions and facades and bullshit and work at this.     and she does want to work at this.   she doesn't want to let another one pass by, doesn't want let another one go just because she was afraid, because she was selfish with how she felt.   this one's different, special. a lot like her and not at all.  it's almost amusing how eeriely similiar their fears are. three magaritas, odd eighties rock music and countless of scrabble games to pass time later, she knows this. wants this.  defies gravity, she stumbles and steps on stains, snakes, demons. two burnt defrosted dried roses, one off-white the other red; now pale okra yellow and the other a deep maroon, both entirely different but they look so well together. she twines the stalks together and presses poetry, prose on it.   creates art.  lets make music together; dance with me.

      it's funny how it takes an eating disorder, a conversation in the bathtub, scented candles and rational thinking to get her in this position.  she's going to be just fine..  really.  :)  to barker she says, i don't have the answers, and i don't know how, there are limitless choices to limitless problems..actions speak louder than words. i am hurt by your indecision but understanding of where you come from, i don't hold it against you but rather hope you'll come to a conclusion soon. wavering in between gets so hard after a while, the need to crawl back into your arms and push you away frustrates me...but i think i'm going to be okay. actually, i know i'll be, it just makes me tougher i suppose...stronger.  i'll work on the movie with you, such close proximity might seem to bring problems but lets not throw this out of the window because we screwed up okay? work is work and play is well, play.  it's hard to handle hot and cold. it's hard to be secure when i don't know where you stand, becuase sometimes you seem so there and sometimes so far away it's hard to reach you.   the hardest part is knowing i've been here before...and seeing how it ended.   ---  to the boy, ironic isn't it that right as i mentioned it, it all came crashing down. did you make the voodoo cutout you promised to make a long time ago? and if you did, damn, you worked it well.   want to know the odd thing? i'm at the flipside of how our relationship used to be, and i see now the crap you had to go through. all this being afraid bullshit...pahhh. we are such stupid idiots sometimes, letting fear dictate us. sigh. i'm stupid.   i'm surprised we hung on for as long as we did. such stubborn assholes..  hm. so now not only do you drink and party but even do the socializing thing? yay! and one nighters...whoop. whoop. which i suppose draws back to the see-saw where i'm out of it and you're in it, i'm happy and you're sad, la di da, that type of shit.  men are evil but women? women are scary.   and i would know.   :P  and yes, life is a bitch.  ---  we came by your place this afternoon, to check out the apartments you know? i'm moving out...and that's such a 'grown up' thing to do. sure, i've been 'independent' the last few months...but to move out? move out? hm.  i didn't shave tiki though, and i left the 'hugs' at home, so i guess i'll come around again another time.  i'll keep my yellow ribbon up for your brother okay?  thank you for caring, sorry i'm such a lousy silly friend.   lets go to the beach and play music again sometime.   p/s and the answer is coke.   ---  your mother, father and i have been talking a lot these couple of days.  and i mean a lot.  and as your younger less achieving sister i say, would you please quit making the bar so damn high?  i miss you.  ---  old man, how did the show go tonight?  sorry i missed your call, fucking pilots lost again. too much commotion from the game and too many people around to talk. yes, 'talk'. but i'm okay now, i promise.   we need to go to waffle house again soon, i have a math review i need to get done by monday.   my waffle house thank you very much.  and maybe wal*mart too...what do you think?  :P  ---  the demons have rested, the girls are tired, the dragon's passed out.  time for bed.  time to recharge for a, hopefully, new day tomorrow.

      she paints in rituals to feel comfortable, to know what's expected and how things go yet there is a certain boldness to it, a extraordinary difference..space to intercorrelate with her demons to pry. to mess up things a while, to change how the circumstances are and to deny all plausibility.  she ends scrabble games and exercises her mind, keeps it fresh and humming yet she drops a class today. an unexpected decision, a shock to most...her? but why? the stress? but you're making fucking excellent grades and i don't understand? her teacher refuses to sign the sheet, pleads with her...some sort of understanding at least the professor says, but she only shakes her head and stares back down at the linoleum, piercing it with her eyes wishing the ground would create a hole she could sink in.  they say you can only run on emptiness for so long before you have a breakdown...she's getting close to that. she empties her  stomach, damages her throat and let the acid gnaw at her insides. the scars on her wrists from the slits a while ago have now faded, except if you look closely, except if she lets you come close enough. perhaps she'll even tell you about them...perhaps she'll even show you. let you in.  she pops in pills and searches for instant relief. what a fucking time to quit her addictions, to go cold turkey. not exactly a smart move but hell she's executing this to the end, she screams. stands her ground. the very same determination and bitch in her that disintegrates her being is the same one that keeps her alive.  journal entries from a year ago, six months, three days are all almost painfully exactly the same. hurt, betrayed, left, running, scared. all that perfect bullshit yet everyone from her past that sees her says she's changed and she doesn't know how to take it. changed good? or changed bad? she doesn't know...just changed.   hell, even the pictures look different.  behind her eyes of a more recent photo illuminates hope and certain jaded dullness. there is something brighter and more naive about her younger years...before she moved across the world, before she got her heart broken, before she tried to piece things together again. and she still hasn't, well not exactly, but well that her life isn't complete yet. that there are still so many holes and booby traps, so many unknown hazards in this journey and sometimes, she truly struggles.  she tries sometimes, yet sometimes, it's so hard to just do that.   to face another day nor to face herself.   people come and go, what makes this person so important, so special?   she doesn't have the answers....perhaps it is a gut feeling.  her biggest fear is latching on, substitution, clinging on to something that isn't what it is but making it to be.  is she capable of love?  should she try again?

      ever feel like you have so much to say yet nothing at all?  like when you come down to it, all you have is a whole bunch of words, a couple of random tears, and a shitload of emotions while keeping a little bit of common sense with you yet losing all sense of sanity.   it gets like that sometimes, and you can't worry anyone and try to protect the whole wide world so you cry at night, when no one watches. so you hurt at night, when no one sees. it isn't that you're being ignorant, it's two parts really, the first being you suck at asking for help, suck at not being alone. the second because you're afraid of hurting someone with your pains, afraid of making them worry, afraid of making them cry with you...maybe because you don't think you're enough, maybe because you aren't enough. i don't know.  i didn't want to push you in a corner tonight, i didn't mean to force you into anything. i know it seems like that, i replay our conversations, and i hate myself and the callous bitchy way i was, like the world revolves around me and i'm the only one feeling icky. at least i hope i'm not anyway.   i don't know what it was tonight. i went through all of yesterday convincing myself that i needed space, that i couldn't handle being withing three feet of you or having you touch me. hug me. because i knew it would hurt, and i would miss us, miss waking up to you or finding your arms around me at night. it would hurt to remember that we were over and if only i just pretended that things were okay, i could be numb and blinded, i could just smile and laugh and smile again. pretend. they don't call me a drama student for nothing you know? i wanted to get as far away from you as possible, maybe because i was hurting, i'm sorry.   some part of me wants to work this out. wants to because it's worth and maybe, perhaps, we are too. but see, i can't tell you that for a fact, i can't tell you everything's going to be okay and we're going to stay strong through this. i can't tell you that there are not going to be moments where i want to run or you want to run, i can't tell you that i'll never intrude into your bubble nor can i say you'll never. but i know that this much is true, i'll make space, if you'll make space for me too. i'll learn to not piss you off so much, not irritate you...i'll learn to push the right buttons and attempt to make this work. i just need to know that you'll try and you won't give up without a fight. i need to know for me at least that when it gets hard, you aren't just going to run because i know how fucking liberating that feels....to run away from it all. i've ran my whole life and frankly, i'm tired of running. tired of not giving enough or giving too much.  yes, you did hurt me. perhaps mostly with the thought that i came into your bubble. that hurts the most, i don't know why. i think because i was fighting urges to run and it's painful to know someone didn't exactly want you around. that i violated some law i considered sacred. here's this dumb bitch, being a burden. i'm sorry.  are there issues? yes. there always will be. there also always will be more excuses though. somehow, i want to believe that if we both want this bad enough, we'll make it through. whether i'm american or not, whether i lose an arm in some freak accident, whether you grow blind, whether i move or stay or you move or stay...i don't know. at least i want to believe that anyway, i just need to know, you want this. but then again, that's prolly the million dollar question.   here's the deal big guy, we need to decide if we want this, and if we really do, then we can go from there. so maybe there'll be time where we take one step forward and three steps back but hey, you know what? shit happens. besides, whatever doesn't break you makes you stronger eh?  i don't know, barker.  you tell me.  i'm tired of playing games and sticking my head up my ass. you know where to find me, my number and all that shit, you decide. loving me is a challenge and i'm not going to sit here and try and sell myself or tell you lies, it's going to be hard. it's going to be shitty. and it's going to be icky.   but maybe that's not all there is to it?  i'm here if you want this.  and if not, it's okay to walk away.  it's okay to just be friends.  it's a whole lot better than being unhappy.   and just for the record, it's okay to question. it's okay to have questions and i am not mad, or angry with you. it's only human, and self-protection mode always kicks in for preservation. and yes, i'm glad we tlaked too.  take care you.

      i want to say lets try again.  i've felt the bitter aftertaste of what it feels like to be on the other side, of trying to deal with someone else that is so much like me.   they say revenge is sweet and this is almost ambrosial. high lows, up downs, not mine anymore. spiraling into an abyss that i absolutely have no control over, his decisions, his wants, his needs.  lets go to the hockey game together, let's watch a sunrise at the beach again, come play at the bay with the dolphins with me. come talk to the angels and dance with the fairies, come lay down with me.  hurt only takes you so far, the fear of pain should not eradicate something that could be so magical.   there are options, solutions, problems and instances. there are real things, actual hard shit to get through, long-distance for summer, shooting in the fall, graduating in a year, moving to orlando..will you come? will you stay? parents, trying, us, fears.  afraid of letting go yet needing to trust, to let in. let me in.   i'll show you mine if you show me yours.  i need you to trust me just like i need to trust you.  i need you to learn to let me in just like i need to learn to let you in.  it's scary, it's enticing. it's good thoughts one moment and scary, suffocating moments the next. it's wanting to run but enjoying this at the same time. yes, i've tasted that bitter medicine before, and just like before, it killed the relationship. letting fears consume, drive, and overwhelm.  maybe that's why i understand, maybe that's why it hurts, because i know you're trying, and you're confused, frustrated...and i wish i wasn't the source of that. and i wish i could be your friend, that i could put my feelings aside and be strong enough for you. support you and help you figure things out, make things nice for you, be there for you.  but sometimes, i'm afraid too. and i get a little scared and insecure, i'm pissing afraid you'll leave me. pissing afraid you'll come to realize i'm nothing like you think i am, i'm afraid history repeats itself and the patterns continue, that some day we won't be friends anymore and i'm going to lose a friend, a companion, a lover.   and i really don't want that.  and so i don't know where this goes, or how things are going.  except that i like having you around.   and you make me laugh, smile, dance in the dark, and sing to the nymphs.  so nothing is perfect, so nothing is anything, but sometimes, i suppose, exceptions are made.  and nothing is ever as it seems.  sometimes, you just have to toughen up and try.  sometimes, we just have to try.  you think?

      "sorry, i wasn't around when you rang? / sorry, i was in the shower? / sorry, the hairy green polka dotted purple monsters under my bed ate my phone? / sorry, i just didn't feel like talking?"  i rehearsed what i was going to leave on your answering machine, convinced i was going to be lucky enough to get it...i guess i didn't expect you to ring again. or try. but then, in true fashion, you rang just as i clicked on 'send'...and i wasn't expecting that.  and so i didn't know what to say.  and so i couldn't find the words.  i wanted to say, yes, let's go watch a movie tonight. yes, lets go climb a mountain. yes, let's go do something together...and talk..and have coffee...and all that good stuff...but that's scary.   and now puck's on the phone yelling about 50'000 dollars and a pilot game, and here i go whining again.   making up excuses.   urlLink  "If you’re not the one then why does my soul feel glad today? If you’re not the one then why does my hand fit yours this way?

       "Well I blew it. I drove away from her in more ways then one tonight. I'm no good at knowing what to say or knowing what to do. I broke a promise tonight also. I hurt her. I may have passed up the opportunity of a lifetime. For years I've pissed and moaned about wanting to be in a good relationship. For years I've whined about no woman wanting me. And here she came with a red ribbon wrapped around her and I returned to sender. What the fuck! I worried whether or not I could handle the relationship. I questioned my feelings for her. I drove away and couldn't decide whether I should be relieved or upset. I came home and looked at the mirror and I saw a newly emerged Jerk. So what do I do Is it Miser time or do I get her back?  Was she my last chance? The one perhaps? I don't know. But it was the same indecision that got me dropped. She is hurt and I am an ass. What do I do? I guess I sleep and figure things out later.   -SIDEBAR- I write subconsciously knowing she'll read. ;(..."   ---  "you wanted to know why i still go. i'm not sure. do i care? do i want ammunition? is it just a habit? i couldn't tell you. i'd like to say i'm at a place in my life where i no longer have the desire to see you suffer, but i'm not entirely sure that's true. i'd like to say that being vindictive doesn't suit me, but in reality it suits me to a t. i don't know what i'm doing, with you or my life or anything. lately i've been trying to branch out and be more sociable. the me that exists now is more different than any other me you've known. i'm more of a "guy" now than i ever have been in the past. i'm sure you can tell from the last two entries just how things are going. but then there are nights like tonight, where it all comes crashing down. i realize that the things i've been filling my life with are empty. empty, yet at the same time somehow fulfilling. i have a lot of fun. it seems like for the first time i'm actually living my life. and while alcohol and no-strings evenings are fun...in the end my heart still only wants one. i'm still lonely and in the end i still want a companion. and of course, i've picked someone far out of my league and currently taken. i never was a smart man, and alcohol seems to be killing what brain cells i have left. the best part is that my best friend knows i like her. he also knows that she finds him very attractive. so he realizes that he can have what i want at nearly any time. while he wouldn't, he likes to fuck with me and push my buttons on a daily basis.  i don't know about any of that healing bullshit. getting calloused isn't really healing. something bothers you so you develop a thick skin. i still have to skip everything about him. it still gives a little white hot flash of pain. a brief flashback. quickly forgiven, but never forgotten. i'd like to say that i wish you both the best, but i'm not sure how sincere i'd be.  i don't know what else to say. i'm not the man you fell in love with. and yet, i'm also now more that man than i ever have been in my life. healing? moving on? it seems to me that we're just running around in circles.  life's a bitch"  ---   i should have known, i understand. i know fear, i know about running away. retribution. ironic how she steps forward to talk about it and it bites her in the ass.   her world comes crashing down and "her girls" go into a frenzy.  school. barker. her family. going home. medication. being sick. war. parents. moving. trying. shitforbrains.   same old brand new shit.  it all overwhelms her, too many things going on at once. too many obstacles, too hard a course, and she wishes to just escape reality a while, and she wishes to just go away. to not be her. to not face the world and shooting grounds.   the hardest part is having to realize, she wasn't even expecting this. this fall, this crash, was not set up...and so it hurts like a bitch. and so it's six times harder. just like the eight hundred and seventy two million things in her life that need to be solved right now and then and need to be figured out.  well fuck figuring out, and fuck her.  yet she knows she set herself up for this one.   she really, really should have known.   she's using up space.  she really shouldn't be here.   how fucking repetitive. a pattern, she has a problem. the problem is loving her.   she needs to go away.   she craves for an escape.  afraid that when she starts, she won't stop.   she cries.  weeps.   sobs.   whatever.

      he rings.   i told him to come back when he was ready, to get his shit settled then come home and he tells me he wants to. i walk by aisles and aisles of clothes and shoes but i walk empty handed, something that used to make me so happy isn't even working anymore. i only see faces, and signs, and emptiness etched in everything i touch, feeling when i really shouldn't.  i feel the phone vibrate against my skin and fight back pangs as his name flashes across the screen. i walk faster, a little hyperventilated and fidgetty, click on silent and walk again. run even. and it beeps to tell me to check my voice message, and it beeps to tell me he's on the other side. the other line.   i hide but i need to know, i want to know. does he hurt like i do too? is he as much in pieces, afraid to cry, scared?   i listen. i click. i press 'send' then question what the fuck i'm doing but the dial tone soothes me; this connection, this knowing he's not so far away, this knowing he's on the other side and i feign happiness and sarcasm. i smile and laugh and make conversation. he poses questions which i only avoid, he iniates conversation but i have nothing to say, afraid to say. afraid to put out again.  you're never had a three o'clock have you? you've never cried yourself to sleep and woke up to tears, you've never been so afraid of sleeping, of being alone, of having to face that few minutes with yourself before you fall asleep. never learned to love someone, let someone in, let him change you, let him affect you, let him into your life and make space for him, need him, never come to a painful, scary, truthful realization that it's not safe anymore. that he hurts you. that he's changed. that you've changed. that things aren't okay and you hate yourself, and you hate your being and you hate everything there is to hate about you.  tired of being an adult. tired of being me. wanting escape, wanting to runaway a while, wanting to go somewhere, go someplace else, wanting to be oblivious. wanting to pretend everything is okay and all will be right. wanting to be strong but not strong enough. wanting love but not capable of being loved. wanting space but being afraid of being alone. wanting to try but scared that you'll give up.  i've let you break down walls, make love to me, come into my world. the hardest part is knowing it isn't quite the same for you, that you didn't specifically feel the same way, perhaps that hurts the most because here we go again. letting someone in, i really, really should learn my lesson by now. i'm not worth it. i'm not enough. i'm not anything as far as anything goes. when will my thick ass numb skull learn this?   you miss me you say.  i ask how it's any different.  you say i've gone away.  you've left too.  you drove away.  i stayed.  i'm not strong enough for this shit.  not good enough.

      so things are a little chaotic at the set of deliverance. too many dragons to slay, too many demons to silence as everything that once touched was gold collapses into shreds of steel that screech with every flake. an old brass, a tarnished silver, a worthless unpolished, uncrafted gold...the sirens are wailing, the walls are whispering, the voices are screaming; get me out, turn away, search for an exit, runaway.  the bay soothes me as i fall into piercingly cold water and swim. i swim to no one and into the heart of the ocean, i kick and splash and splutter in my flabby fat legs and my washboard chest, i drown and play with the dolphins and the mullets and the crabs. perhaps even the invisible sharks that never come to play, the ones that he convinces me are there...sometimes i wonder what it would be like to die ripped apart?  you would be proud of me today, i did not fear death but rather, welcomed it. hell, the both of you would have been.   you, who i awake to and fall asleep to at night. you, who makes love to my body and soul and calms me down...rationalizes the fuck out of me, smiles and laughs the crap out of me. i talk exhaustingly of the art you create in my life, of the works you thread into my quilt and the colors you introduce to my life. i blog, i rant, i scream, i dance to your music, to your voices, to your hopes and dreams of us but yet i stumble, and find myself searching for the nearest available exits, looking for signs, searching for independence and not letting go but holding on to familiarity.   i find myself turning the other way at night, putting my back towards you when the voices haunt late at night.  'you're not good enough, he's blinded, you're ugly, run before you fall in too deep'  but then your damn arms always hold me tighter and your damn lips always find mine, your eyes always shines with a smile and your heart always loves like a child. innocently, unwaringly, naively towards all the damn hurt i could cause you, towards all the damn shit i could put you through, towards how unbelievably impossible it would be to love me.   you smile, even as my mom comes off her spiel of us sleeping together. you say, it's okay, that it's alright, that everything's going to be fine. you take blame even if a good half of it is my doing and damn, you look so bloody good in a shirt and tie. stepped off the pages of gq and into my life, she says we look cute together and i say, me? like hell no.   you look like you could be with some beautiful exotic chick with long thin legs, ravishing shiny curly hair and a smile that could dazzle a million hearts. a woman that could launch a thousand ships. and then i wonder again, what the hell are you doing with me again?  but sometimes though, sometimes i think we fit like spoons. the way your hands curl around my waist just right like gloves or the way i'm not tall enough but short enough so my head lies on your chest and feels your heart beat. the way i sometimes know what you're saying and even if i've used seven hundred unnecessary words to explain something, you've understood it with the first word.   you make fun of my accent and the funny way i dissect my food, you poke at my funny views on life and take charge of my odd ways. you don't always say the right things, and you won't always do them...but the greatest part for me is knowing that you will always try.  thank you.  ---  perhaps then there's you. old man.  person that started me on this journey, person that has helped me along the way. the one that wipes away my tears and soothes the sobbing, the one that tells me i'm beautiful when i'm nothing, the one that listens to me bitch, whine, assholically rant about my problems and my needs and my wants and my everything then sits down and figures them out for me. a herculean task, an impossible god damn fuck me now thing to try and keep her happy, try and keep her sane, try and fix her life but you courageously do it, but you willingly do it. why?  perhaps i'll never know.   perhaps i'll always wonder.  perhaps i'll never understand the way your fragile mind works nor the voices in your head i ignore half the time because i'd like to talk about mine. you show me wrong, then right, then the in-between. you show black, then white, then the grays. hell, i can say, for sure, that you're the man in my life that will call the cops on me, cry when you see me, make fun of me, laugh at me, and tell me i'm a stupid retarded asshole all in a span of an hour.    you make jokes and laugh but i know that trick too. the yankees won because they were distracted by the stripes, we'll win because they'll be distracted by the smiles, and the laughs, and the pretend-to-be's.  don't hurt yourself old man, i'll listen. i care.   i'll be your three o'clock if you'll be mine. the mother is here and i am excited and intimidated of the prospect of the both of you meeting up. like barker, i wonder what it'll be like...what you'll think? what she'll think? what you would say? what she would say?  i tell her about how you wait and take me to the head doctor when puck is busy, how your tired ass sits in the car and waits, then waits somemore, or how you sit with me at waffle house and i yell at you because you don't know how to do my bloody homework too, or how i drag your sorry ass for knowing me at three, sometimes, four, even six, in the morning for a cup of coffee and a smiley faced waffle at MY waffle house and not the plaintiff's nor yours. i talk about how i make you sit through countless and countless hours of varying monologues making you search for them to find the right one for me and find the right tone, the right voice, the perfect expression because racheal khong has to have an a and nothing else is acceptable.  i don't tell her about the cops though, but i suppose that will be a great story to tell the grandkids someday. it might give her a heart attack or she might die laughing...of course, i can only laugh about it now eh?  i think about how insane it is that i've only known you for a couple of months and i wonder what it would've been like if i wasn't casted, if i didn't go to the auditions, if i wasn't in the musical.   scary thought but what ifs always are.  i love you old man, you take care now.  ---  everyone would scream at me for talking to you but i want to. i don't know why, i've been thinking about you...i always seem to don't i? i suppose you did hurt me quite a bit, inflicted a little bit of damage they say but as always, just as my blog mirrors yours, i stirred up some shit in your life didn't i? changed you, you say...made you into the being you are now, created hate in a place that once had love and i know you feel so damn sorry for the boy...you snicker and laugh and point fingers. wondering what the fuck i'll do to this new victim next then not bother at all.   the truth is, i don't know either. sure i'd like to tell you we'll make it, sure i'd like to tell you i'm more secure than i've ever been, that my meds are fixed and i'm almost okay, but then that condescending cocky route always leads me into trouble. always gets my ass burnt.  sometimes i wonder what the hell you're doing here, why you still come in...and sometimes it bothers me. bothers me because you care or bothers me because you're laughing at everything i say and mocking every word i come out with. i don't know. the phone rang the other day, and she asked about you...i laughed it off and said you were busy with the perfect woman that's slipped into your life now, then that section ended with me hoping that you were okay. knowing that you were doing better, getting better, moving on.  some days i wonder if we'll ever speak again, somedays, i don't want to.   but nights like tonight, i wrote to just say, i hope you're doing fine. i hope you're okay. i hope you're happy now.  nights like tonight, i wrote because i couldn't call, couldn't mail, too personal, too real, too there.  you walk three lonely miles and turn back to notice, you've changed a lot since then. you've grown up, but you're still the same person, and you'll always be her.  some part of me will always want to be somebody else, will always strive to be somebody else, yet at the same time, i know, some part of me will learn to love me. and accept me. and forgive me.  so anyway, this was half your post. almost directly, almost to you and you would know it too. you'd know it was you without having me say your name..so it'd be out there. so i wouldn't have to hide. wouldn't have to pretend.  we're moving on. we're growing up. we're learning.  we're walking, slowly and painfully away.  we're healing.   separating.  going our own ways.  ---  there's so much talk about next term, about whether i'll come back or not, or move out, or move back, or move in. there's talk about the war and medication and growing up. talk about school and travelling and trying harder, immaturity and maturity issues, of hiding and pretending and not letting them in enough. they sometimes just ambush through and my defenses aren't hard enough but i think perhaps sometimes, i want them to come in, i just don't know how.  and so another conversation ends with my father, and he says we love you again. collectively as a unit even if my mother is in the other room, they function as one. separated by far too many oceans, their love still prides me. twenty five years and they're still going strong, perhaps that's what it takes to keep this family going, perhaps that's what it takes to keep her going. and her dragons. her demons. her fears. her wants. her needs.  so goddamn selfish racheal.  pride and joy my ass as she does another stupid thing that pains them. as she runs the water and throws up again. as the pain washes over and she breaks her pills again. as she does another stupid thing and her mom says, why can't you be more like your brother? why can't you grow up? why can't you just color within the lines?  i wonder sometimes.   trying to be different i suppose.  trying to be me.  being stupid.  being worthless.  being a bitch and selfish.  being retarded.  sorry mom.  sorry dad.  sorry koko.  ---  the walls raspy whispers awakens the sleeping child; she searches...moans...screams. awakens, in deep slumber, she startlingly stumbles around..searching. slaying her dragons, silencing her demons, she ripples the threading earth.   she falls.

      it's that giggle you get when you're being silly, just a tad out of line you know? a little extraordinary feeling that makes you do the 'wee-wee' dance as puck and blue-shirt have the longest conversation ever known to mankind and he gets just a little more inebirated with the girls. they drive off to go stalk barker's ass and sneak tulips to his car, watching out for the capped boy in box and making sure the cops don't get rung on their asses.  she's a little tired, a little cranky, a little defensive.   a little out of line and in need for relief. numbness. distraction.    cookies don't turn out, dinner's left a mess to clean up and school fucking starts tomorrow. an empty house she walks without clothes on and dutifully does her chores in pure commando style only that there is no cover up. she thinks perhaps there is subtle and conscious decisions to do the things she does; to get comfortable in her skin...to shed off layers. open up, strip, be loved, love.  finally gets to his post, his email, his things as words wash over the screen and her heart dances.  and yes baby, i like.  (woof.)  :P   "I am expecting a different set of experience in Pepsicola but not less interesting and enriching so who cares about what war.  I am going and going with full of joy to see my only daughter.  She will give me the usual set of headaches but I love her all the same just like I love my lor koong passionately and my only son dearly.  You are all that matters so I’ll hop around and find my own piece of fun."    her mom arrives in a couple of hours, she's unsure about how she feels. excited, intimidated, nervous, preoccupied, retarded...ready for changes yet happy to just stay with familiarity..the coming together of what seems right but feels wrong. strange. of medication, and stepping up, and try, try, trying again.  he's excited to meet her, decked up and ready to go. so is old man and a bunch of her friends, excited to show her how much she's grown, moved on..lived independently.  last night, she questioned. she broke down and had a good cry...the first in a while. it's been a while hasn't it? since she's looked in the mirror, since she's had to be with herself...her mind...her soul.  'let me in, let me in'  she thinks about it constantly....where she would have been had she took that flight. had she stayed. had she not come here.  she wouldn't have met barker. or puck...and her hair would still be brown and not the flaming orange it is now which hopefully, she'll get fixed by tomorrow...just a surprise for the mother you know?   she moved here seven months ago, and in seven months she's done quite a bit hasn't she?   she remembers the way his fingers trail her skin and she shivers...because this feels so real? because he seems so honest? because they genuinely look like they could make it? i don't know.  but there's something about the way she grins when his name flashes across her phone, or how secure she feels when she falls asleep in his arms. something about the way he holds her hand and holds her tight, softly, gently and firmly all at once. something about the way he makes love to her and doesn't just fuck her, doesn't just make her feel like an object or a toy.   there's something nice about knowing she has the icing on the cake, that she's the lucky one. that at the end of the day, they can sit and exchange stories and not get overbearingly protective or jealous. she laughs sometimes, when she's alone remembering the way his face lights up or unexpected surprises along the way.  he's hot. so fucking sexy and adorable at the same time. but more than anything else, she respects him, feels up to parr and sometimes even lower and not have that pressing need to hide things, or pretend. that it's okay she's done the things she has, that she is the person she is, background, job, person, whatever. it's just a bunch of hogwash with them because what matters in the end is what they are made of, what their heart, soul, and mind represents.  learning a little bit more of herself, him, and the both of them together as days go by. the things they like to do together, apart, constructively. as summer rolls around and he starts working on the film obsessively and she goes home, what would things be like? or shooting, the spaces between, schedules conflicting and tired cranky bums at the end of the day. moving out, moving in, will things be easier? harder?   something about his willingness to make sacrifices scares her and makes her heart soar at the same time. for me?   you're retarded. stupid. silly.  all mine.  :P

       urlLink      i am still the same person, stuck in a different body, a different face, a marred figure.   i am still beautiful in the inside, just as i was before i got hurt. i still have the same name, the same eyes, the same body...perhaps just a little different. but you see, i'm still me.  i talk funny, look funny, act funny, it hurts to touch, to feel, to see sometimes. it hurts to accept.  so tonight, as you drive home from a good weekend, as you celebrate the coming of spring and have a couple of beers, please drive safe.    puck, madonna, curly sue and maria cruise around picking up hot young things. unsuspecting victims to night filled with crazy endeavors of waffle houses and sworn insomniacs. of course it is the coldest night out but the top still  stays down, just so there's still access to random shouting and catcalls. wolfwhistles and offers, the 'strip' is busting, flowing, bursting. knickers are in a twist, girls are out to party, the waves roar and crash in a distance, the jeep hums, the people dance. stalk. pick up. drink.  they curl up behind, madonna's head on her left and puck's on her right. relaxed, screaming, singing. it is an interesting night but she notices again, how careless people are with drinking, how horridly pathetic the need to get high overcomes the need to be safe.  if only someone would explain.  if only the kids understood.  if only we'd mature.  if only.

      broken hearts, weeping tears, a united family tearing...crying. a lost son, a missing father, a dying soldier.  we are a proud batallion. we are a strong nation. we are a rallying world.  too painful to watch, to hard to not see. go out? runaway? ignore?  only so far, only so long before you come home and watch obsessively again. judge. formulate. try to make sense.  hurt by one of your own, a cameraman, a marine officer, a newbie fighter...too stressed? just cracked?   fucking betrayed.  i finally agree, or see rather, the need for war. accept...but yet my heart bleeds. everytime a plane goes down, the phone rings. was that kirk mom, was that kirk?  special forces.  kuwait.  you're fucked being one of the best in your field.  but you stand proudly defending your country, for the stripes and stars, for freedom that stems from the brave.  this is my dream, my passion. to stand at battlefield and report, to understand, to enlighten. to bring coverage, to stand in dangerous ground, to go places no one wants to, to challenge the unknown. there's something sinfully guilty about, something disastrously beautiful.  i am afraid of death, but it is that fear that drives me. that need to achieve all my hopes and dreams, that need to do the things i need to do. before i die. before i walk through the pearly gates. before i meet cerberus. scares, i woke up this morning and willingly took my medication...on time for that matter.  i sat on the countertop while he made coffee and we talked. perhaps there was something very enticing about the aroma but it was a good feeling as he told me more stories and opened up a little bit more. the strange amazing intoxicating part of this is that we're still learning about each other and it gets better each day.   walking out the door repeatedly for about the next five times in two minutes, each time returning his silly little ass forgetting about something while i stole another kiss and the jangle of his keys led to the door. tapped on keys, a short stoic post, a scrabble game, chatting to random strangers and replying email, i watched the short hand touch six then seven then crawled back into bed at a quarter to eight.  hid back beneath sheets that smelled of him and fell asleep.  drifted off to fairyland and dungeon monsters.  waking back up to him opening the door...smiling.  "hey you."  it's a big world out there, the girls are going out to party at the beach. spring is finally here, the shops have opened up and the boardwalk comes alive. so go out, live life, dream....stay safe.  come home.  live.

      we're at the boy's house again, a night of pure intense horror, a scary gory pissingly bloody but good movie; something to keep the heart pumping i suppose plus a night out with her friends while barker joins them for a while before going home. he's had a horrible night and she irks for him, wanting to make things better as his fingers find hers in the now familiar darkness of this quaint cinema. a single forgotten rose slips in between as they watch the ending together; her in his lap.  she slips in brownies specially made for blue-shirt, the silly girls swirling caramel and figuring out between olive and vegetable oil. sleeping in tranquility, singing to puck tinkering on the grand piano, twanging between different rhythms and sounds. making music together before puck horribly plays and sings to a long, long, thankfully forgotten song.  getting dressed together, running around in knickers and bras, sorting out different cuts and styles, jeans and pants, capris and hipsters, chokers and chains, make-up and lotions. television blaring, stereo pounding, cellphones ringing, chaos is welcomed in this world.  a great night out and it's a quarter to half past three, she comes 'home' to him. stroking onyx on his lap and she purrs and her striking eyes demands territory. candle lit, music, monitors purring..he's working on a couple, she on his. searching for words to describe her feelings right now; they share an ashtray. a quiet that's nice, random words shared in between: it's kinda nice how they can do their own things together. yet it's beautiful, sweet, perhaps almost "perfect" in some sense. a dejavu like feeling washes over her, the security she constantly bitches about, the one she craves, it's here now. she's found it.

      it's when you can make love slowly, seductively and feel every solitary sense on every inch on your body come alive that perhaps things might be okay.  when he grabs you forcefully, like a crescendo in a masterpiece as he climaxes and his eyes rolls back, his mouth opens and lips wet with desire. when he strokes you to sleep and cuddles up next to you, protecting arms shielding away from unnecessary thoughts. whispering lyrics, as sleep washes over you and you are transported into a surreal dimension, a comfortable place...a place you're beginning to know. to learn about.  when tears stream down your cheeks and pain deep within spells out fear. fear of intimacy, fear of commitment, fear of leaving...fear of seeing. it's when you've heard all these words before and trusted all this sincerity before and you get confused, and afraid, and sick. it's when you're trying hard to not be sick, be nauseated, it's when you're making a very painfully conscious effort to digest food and it's not sitting well in your tummy. it's when you know how much it would mean to him...how much it would mean to you. but it gets harder, and you are angry with yourself because you have become so weak, you've let your addictions eat you alive. tear you down.   you peel away into a corner and sob quietly, softly so he doesn't hear you. so he doesn't get worried or so you don't lock him into a corner, a place where he has to say something nice about you, a place where he has to tell you you mean something, a place where he is forced to say things and make promises he might not keep.   and so you don't show, and so you weep alone.  except of course for a phone call to the old man. a call of desperation and you whisper so the man on the bed doesn't wake up. he's had about two hours of sleep in the last few days and has had to work his ass off so you want him to get as much rest as he can possibly get. it'll be another long day at work tomorrow, it'd be another twenty-four hours to worry about product placements, and cast meets, and drop-outs, and responsibilities and that damn stupid girlfriend of his.  the phone dies right as you say hie, and hello, and how's it going. but by that time, the old man has heard your voice, heard that scream and cry for help beneath the surface. he's read between the lines but your phone's died out. the battery is dead and you are too naked to walk your yellow ass down to grab the phone, too shy, eyes too puffy. so you wipe away the tears and curse at the phone, reach for your last cigarette and climb into bed with barker.  his sounds. his moans. his whines.   his random hugging and repositioning, his arms that find their way around your waist and his head that grows heavier and heavier on your side as he slowly drifts off to sleep again. or the way his fingers find your hiding place and want to play. the way his lips find yours and the soft kisses he pecks on your forehead. stroking your hair. falling asleep and waking up together.  then comes interesting.  then comes spectacular.  then comes irony, drama, coincidences, and irresponsibility.  the fucking police are at the door.  911 is on the damn phone.  eight new voice messages on the cell.  identical twin brothers with mistaken identities and stats copied. taken down.  she's somewhere. about 5'3. 108 going to 98 pounds. chinese. malaysian. single dimple of the left cheek. talks rather retardedly and looks quite ugly.   where is she? i think she's in trouble. please find her, find her please.  is she alone? is she scared? is she lost? is she hurt? did she take more pills again? is there a bathtub full of blood? goddamnit racheal, what the hell have you done?  other parents on the phone. grown men talk. amanda. lindsay. bryan. ryan. marc.  oblivious to sounds, crashed for the night, thrown up, tired, sick...she sleeps.  24 hours for a missing persons report, no probable cause to have a search warrant, last whereabouts....like pussy and her cell they come together; she's not picking up. where are you little girl, where are you?  finally the cops come pounding but the house is empty, a hit, but the twins come home and thump loudly on the door. awakened, startled like the night before and that horrid dream. a name mentioned she remembered, throws on clothes and runs downstairs leaving beauty to sleep on the bed.  screaming, shouting, crying. she's safe, come over, we found her, she's alright, she's alive, she's in one piece, it's okay.  call made to dispatch, no baker act. no baker act. she's fine. just a misunderstanding, just losing grip on reality, just pure simple immaturity.   she goes back up to get barker. baby, i think we're in trouble. baby, i think i just fucked up. baby, come hold me.  he is....i don't know. i can't read him right now, he is confused. upset. a little angry. a little agitated. a little annoyed. he is barefoot, standing on rocky pavement in t-shirt and jeans holding me, looking at things with patient eyes. simple he says, it's going to be okay. but i'm a drama queen, and all five people on that sidewalk are drama people. theater, film, everything.   nothing is simple.  nothing is black and white.  racheal needs red, and oranges, and bright bright pink.  his eyes look so tired as i look back at the old man and see that his too is weary. worried. madonna and puck? i don't know.  i come home and finally plug the phone in.   i talk for a long, long time with the other parents. i talk about moving out and barker fitting into my life. i talk about the old man and how he's saved me too many times. i talk about trying to take my life and the war and being irresponsible. i talk about the night before and how he walked in on me hurting myself. i talked and talked and talked and talked. talked till there was nothing else left to say, you see honey, it was quite simple...just tell the truth.  it was so much easier.  rather than pretending. rather than lying. rather than concealing.  i've just listen to the voice messages. my birth dad left me one just to see how i was doing. it said, 'hi racheal, papa here, can you please call me back? we love you," and it was simple. it was kind. it was daddy.  papa.  she hasn't called him that in a while...   even puck said love you. and puck never ever says love you voluntarily..and so that meant a lot. and she's never felt so loved in her life. so special. she made people worry...she didn't mean too..people actually worry about her?  she still has fears. doubts. things to be afraid of..the future, barker, school, coming back, the war, getting cured, all sorts of good shit to blog about. all sorts of things to scare her with...but you know what?  she's going to be okay.  she's going to be just fine.  with or without, can or cannot, does or does not, will or will not.  it'll be right.  i'm alright.  :)  thank you.

      we argue about 'making love', 'fucking', 'sex'. would you rather have, "baby, please make love to me," or "i want you to fuck the shit out of me,"...then we laugh it off, cuddle again...your sexy very naked body leaning against mine...complimenting my frame. making our reflection look nice. wonderful. almost kinda amazing.  you make me feel beautiful and special at once, a gem, as if i could be so precious and valuable. so worth holding on to...i feel your fingers caress mine and the way it spells out genuine all over it, the way it spells out trust and i am happy. and i am loved.  you entice me. you make me wet in waves of ecstacy and delirious with desire. you stimulate my brain muscles and force me to question, to think. you replace cannot with can and must not with must have. you look me in the eye and tell me black from white, real from fake and draw me away from the grays. draw me away from 'me's.   you keep things simple, drama-free. you keep things in order, but not in an anal controling way...you are like the place i come to for balance, for stability. the place i come to to feel safe even if sometimes, letting you in scare me. you don't push away my fears but instead help me figure them out with you.   i love how your arms find their way around my waist and how your breath slows down as you fall asleep. how you slowly get softer and softer and the lyrics not quite audible anymore as my eyelids get heavier and heavier and my heart dances to your song. your rhyme. your beat.  he sings me to sleep.

      it's spring break this week, a holiday, a celebration...a break from shit in school. academic hoo-ha, preparation for the finals and time away to do things for your own. students walk the streets, the beaches are filled with party goers, light shines in their eyes, smiles abound, laughter rings through.  puck's just come back from georgia, a road trip to a theme park somewhere, and she screams with her stories as i go to pick her up. we talk then stop by barker's workplace to leave a rose on his car, so he'll find it when he gets off work, so maybe it'll put a smile on his face after a long day at work. we stop by the mall for dinner, more news on war but it's not 'war' yet. yet.  we're driving, singing, laughing, talking and suddenly, it's real again.  cellphones ring off the hook.  come home now.  come home now.  come home.  there is a lump in my throat and tears continue to stream down her face, it hurts, it's scary, i'm afraid. i find words but i don't know how to comprehend, i can only pray, i can only just continue driving. take saufley, take michigan, left at bauer, right at kaoz, get home. hide. i don't know.  mom don't come in, daddy needs you. i'm okay, i'll be fine, just get off that god damn plane. tense, so fucking tense in london my brother says, jittery, scary. waiting.   waiting to be bombed, waiting for a nuclear attack, waiting for september eleven again.  stay safe, buy duct tape, act paranoid, wear a mask; i don't give a fuck just please please stay safe.   cnn, bbc, am radio, fm radio, the news comes pouring in. the calls come ringing through..but my thoughts don't formulate. my mind so fucking scattered, my heart so fucking jitterry, i sit here with half a mug of cold coffee from this afternoon with the tv blaring in the background, staring at my screen trying to comprehend.  what happens now?  why is this so real?  why does this hit so close to home?  and i curse myself, for every time i was rude to a navy boy. for everytime i snubbed someone from the military. for everytime i took freedom for granted, for every time i put me before others.   this makes you stare yourself in the mirror and say, what have i achieved? what can i do? where do we go now?  this makes you want to curl into a ball and cry, and weep, and sob for all the lives that will be lost.  for all the terror that will reign through.  for all the crap christina's five year old eyes have to see just because greed and evil has clouded our judgement. that in two thousand and fucking three, we still need missiles and war to dictate our teritory. that we have resorted to war.  i'm not against or for, i just wish it didn't have to come down to this.  i just wish this wasn't happening.

      it's when you check your voice messages and someone leaves you a message about home, about grandma, about terrorists and the first thing you think about is are they safe?  when war apparently is supposed to break out in a couple of hours, you shield away from extremities and hide away from talk, like september eleven you keep your own private pains and maybe voice out once in a while, each time remembering the horror, each time crying for the unknown, each time feeling fear run through your very veins and numb you.  it's when you know your mom is flying and you are afraid. afraid because you know she doesn't want to take that flight either, but does it for you, because your needs, your wants, you were more important. what if? you try and not think about it...but what if? you stupid selfish bitch.  singapore, the neighboring country. your home away from home every holiday, half your family, grandma. mysterious illnesses and you cry. you cry because you're afraid, you cry because you don't know what's going on and the world is too damn big. you cry because you're angry, because goddamnit, that's my family.  you cry because you feel threatened, because intercepts at the friend of the family that works at the fbi feeds you horrible things but doesn't say anything, private and fucking confidential with only a note to say, carry a mask if you fly through. fly through? you stupid idiots, my grandmother lives there, my cousins, my aunts, my uncles. are you stupid or crazy or just so god damn dumb? they're there and it's real...it's so damn real.  we're malaysian. i'm malaysian. i come from a muslim country but i'm chinese, it's fucking peaceful and tranquil there but no one knows. everyone is ignorant, everyone holed up in their own little worlds and no one cares to understand, no one cares to listen. i am not a terrorist. i am not a 'threat' just because i understand this culture better. how do i explain? how do i make sense?  there is fear in the adult's eyes. there is talk, there is anger, there is fear.  fear for children on the battlefield, fear for still naive eyes that might mature, that might be forced to grow up too fast. fear for the bodies that will return, fear for the ones that won't come home or those that will with missing arms and broken hearts.  my dad's home alone.   my mom's flying between two kids.  my brother's in london. the capital. another threat.  and i am here.  with news reports and constant growing fears.  i don't care about stupid artificial superficial shit anymore, just please let everyone be safe.  just please don't take anymore lives.  just grant us peace.  please.

      does this scare you? do i scare you? did what i say scare you? will this scare you? he asks in between reasonings, questions...vouching. venturing into space unknown and afraid i suppose, worried.  me too.  old man points out how she's always had that problem with intimacy and running; that bugs her. that intimacy thing; he feels so good next to her, in her, with her..but yes, it does strike her mind sometimes to run. to step away. to walk away just in case...hurt them before they hurt you, you know? leave before they leave.  she loved the feeling of waking up next to him, bare skin on skin and his fingers stroking her hair, kissing the tops of her nose and forehead...holding her in their little cocoon of security. falling asleep to his rhythm, his breath and heartbeat and the warmth of the sheets and his body.  she craved his touch, the way his fingers would slip into her and his tongue explored her. liberating, she felt free. she didn't let go, but she wasn't held back either..she stripped and took pride in it, if only because he made her feel beautiful. special. if only because he made her feel safe.  almost.  his words, the passion that drove him to reach his dreams seduced her. his maturity, his kindness, his thoughtfullness, his generosity..the fact that he had hopes and wants and needs and was not another 'random ass' intrigued her. that he wasn't from the navy, or a forty-year old bastard hanging out at a college club nor her normal attraction to the bad boy asshole with an attitude that makes her think that's the only guy she'll ever deserve entices her.   and as day light rays shone in through blinds, their once only candlelit room became a sanctuary, a retreat to hide awhile. bright harsh morning light, light that would underline her flaws, light that would let him see her...it was strange awhile, ackward...but it was okay. like her 'neck thing', it took time. trust.  maybe she was beginning to...trust him. was that possible? was that  right ?  she wonders sometimes. but then she remembers the car pulling away and the look of his face in the driveway, or how he notices the little things in the big scheme of things, the way his face looks so peaceful as he cuddles up next to you and you think, holy shit, he's so calm, so everything, so happy, so excited, so silly, so goofy, so cute...because of me?  and then she figures  ...just maybe.  we'll see.  :)

      hm..so i've come to the conclusion that i seriously attract men above the age of thirty or so. this is of course proved by the cherry cokes (people really drink that shit or is it just the illusion of funky desirable crap you can come out with the cherry?) and strange, funny looking drinks that flooded out way. or really, maybe it's just my huge non-existent tits.   either really..  very interesting.  :P  barker's upstairs doing something or another..putting roses in water, finding aspirin, sheets on the bed and creamer for the coffee.  a walk by the beach, karaoke singing and dancing...relaxing.  ringing up random waffle houses and terrorizing patrons, hunting down spicers...but it worked didn't it?  brushes off sand from her toes, her pockets and feet...a green monitor, a pounding headache, a different turn.  pla-fucking-cebo.  :P

      walking...hazy illusions cloud my mind: foggy, as if there could be a mist somewhere, a change in temparature. i walk, bdly, but my feet knows where i'm going; my heart leads me.  i'm blinded...but running.  trailing...but dancing.  crying...but smiling.  hiding...but laughing.  i am me..  trying.  Hard.

      i thought i'd seperate melancholic with questionable.  so i've met someone..well, perhaps not really just met someone but that i've known him a while. we calculated a couple of months last night, it's strange. i'm a little taken aback, a little in awe...amazed.  his mind fascinates me, though it isn't just that. there's something intangible about him, something quite distractingly drawing, motioning, tugging...and i wonder sometimes. beneath those looks he gives me, beneath that goofy grin, beneath the way his fingers trail my body...eh?  it's new, it's exciting, it's pleasuring...is it just right now? just before?   long forgotten hidden fears haunt me again, it is that lump in my throat, the sharp intake of breath that suffocates..worries things to death. and i'm confused, scared really...of letting go. of wanting to hold on to facades and layers, of wanting to stay being liked, of wanting to still be loved, be wanted, be needed.  will things change as we learn to get to know each other?  will he realize what others have noticed before?  will he learn to point out the flaws, draw out the ickiness, stab the silent. will he master his weapons to fight against mine, will he get to know the weak spots and attack? will it be safe? will he be safe?  he's a good guy. a hardworking smart bastard. out of my league? i've learned to shut off those doors damnit, i've learned to close away on emotions, to shut out on feeling. enjoy it a while...just don't fall. but there's something different about this one, something distinctly frustrating, a voice i cannot shut off.  i remembered too, our first somewhat 'real' conversation. i remembered putting down the phone and that 'wee-wee' shit. i remembered that night at your house after the first cast meet and how i specifically kept some space between us, how i'd talk to anyone but you except maybe just to punch in a smart ass bitchy remark, except maybe just to ask where the soda was or if it was okay to smoke in here.  yes, i quite remember that. and the conversation in the car with amanda after.   and we'd agreed to not pursue it, to shut up, to just smile and laugh it off. some things just can't happen for a reason.  it's fighting against being attracted, fighting against these feelings that feel so awfully guilty, i made long long mental lists in my mind, i couldn't, i must not, i wouldn't, i just fucking cannot.  and it worked a while. see no evil, hear no evil eh? i kept so fucking quiet i deserve an oscar,  and now as puck, madonna, blue-shirt, old man, curly sue, fruity, and the rest find out about it they go oh my fucking lord. and laugh. and giggle. and go, holy shit i should have figured and awww and really?!?!  and i don't even say anything so they continue their little valley conversations on their own and i just want to run. put on my nikes and speed for the next available ramp, because this feels too real. you're breaking down too many walls and i feel exposed. naked. ugly. you're coming too near and it's dangerous, it's bad to let people in, it's not good to trust, it's evil to let someone in. it's just plain awful bad.  but i can't help it.  and i'm stonking ass pissed with myself.  because i'm such an idiot.  dork.  i want to say lets do something today but then, i say don't fall. don't fall. don't fall. and keep my distance.  so yeah.  hm.  we'll see.  question marks.

      so it's been a while, yes, i've noticed too.  i suppose it's just been absolutely absurd trying to piece together puzzles, figure out distances...work out shit you know? a lot of blind spaces and empty blanks that needed to be filled..i wrote this strange homey post last night...it was pouring in mid-march, with flowers springing up from every imaginable spot...an unexpected surprise. things changing  and evolving around me and trying to put together scattered thoughts and ranging emotions....almost suceeeding even.  then of course, the computer crashes.  falls apart.  and c:/ can't be located.  there's some scan error.  some horrible monster that lives in my computer was disturbed.  so there it went...my little post, the first in a while, into never never land.  and here i am, four o'clock in the afternoon on a monday the day after wondering. figuring. thinking.  ...posting.  they must call this blogger's block, for i can't seem to find the right words and nothing seems to really flow. my brain searches for the right things to say, my heart it's current pains but nothing seems to be able to transpose onto screen, it's as if point a can't and point c can't find b and so it is lost and confusing between. empty.  i'm pissed afraid.  i'm pissed excited.  i'm giggly and laughy and i want to cry out a storm.  run. fly. fall. crawl. search. hide. find.  hm.

      so he asks tired, weary body masked by over-perkiness in his voice, masked by the plastered smile, the raised eyes...lets do something together sometime. can we talk? i'm hurting. life's too fucking interesting, girls are too damn weird, boys need to go screw themselves, heart needs to go away...  and i say honey, it'll be okay.   and i say sweetie, it'll be over soon...things will be right.  ---  ..demon-free, resting. peaceful.  beautiful.  i miss this.  ---  talking with hands, with smile, with eyes and words with double entendre  dashboard confessional playing..(thank you) she remembers the laughs. the heaving of breath in between puck, silent, and barker surrounding her around...nestled in a cocoon of security. attempting to achieve their overlying marathon of watching day break at waffle house, of between the shifts changing and the morning after.  it's funny how much you can learn about each other in a night.  a bad day going extremely good with every breathing moment, with another chuckle, giggle, random burst of lucidness. mad crazy retarded people all with a very sick sense of humor. they connect, on different planes...throw in sexual connotations, throw in movie lines...throw in seven hundred and sixty two under the table, in the shizzo, down with the posse remarks.  she breathes.  walks over to the bathroom.  she's eaten tonight.  smiles at the girl in the mirror.  walks back...lights up, she shush-ed the dragon. they helped her. comfort. freedom. space. friendship.  but she watched his eyes, the way they lit up with joy, with cheekiness, and she watched those very same eyes hurting, strumming the guitar..playing melodies. tunes created...she watched his eyes grow silent, retreat into another world.  how does she tell him he's really an amazing guy?  how does she tell him he's a great damn mother fucker?  falls asleep on the drive home..the wistful sounds on the player, to conversations and directions.   she's resting.  she's sleeping.  she sleeps.   thank you.  "bff"  ---  friday night started out with the ice hockey game, of number twenty one and ten. she laughs in silliness, she walks silent in her thoughts. beach condo, canadians, six girls piled up in a car, two stalkers, one cold, one naive, the other questionable, the girl frustrated.  bags sent to the vault, ice-skating too wet, too many people, strange kooky people trying to hook up. they leave early, unplanned yet up to every precise detail...too rehearsed. too right down to the point it comes out fake; everyone's sick of each other, the car and it's contents have gotten off on the wrong foot. too many hormones in this car, though i should be rejoicing eh?  football on the beach again. scrapped, she might really have to hit them. hurt them.  old man to the rescue. old man always to the rescue...saves them. but not before she makes a phone call. reschedules. medicine adjustment, psychiatric evaluation..keep me out of the hospital. no more blood, no more nights...she gets better now. she tries harder. she wants it more...craves it.  and the girl supports her. 'go get em'.  the girl lights up and comes back to life with blue-shirt, silent and barker. her disposition of walking anger sheds back into giggly valley shit. transitions back into the retarded silliness of a bunch of silly people together.  bird on boob. creamer in mouth. fingers tapping on table.   these are all the reasons you love her.  these are all the reasons she's special just for who she is  ....god only knows how many other people keep big sticks in their car and shares concealer with the bitch.  :P  ---  the gaping questions.  she wonders sometimes too.  silence them, don't overthink.  thinking is bad.  ---  in less than a month they've removed more layers than she's normally used to in this frame of time...as much as she bitches about stripping, she's not very good at it. she's better with the fronts, with the smiley faces and the silly remarks. she's better at being bitchy than hurting...at least in the 'real world' anyway.  barker's made cotton candy and guessed blue-shirt's right age. she's tickled with glee tonight...he actually looked comfortable. okay. like he was having fun or something. did you?  voices, impersonations and music blaring in the overcrowded ghetto parking lot. nail scratching and tickling..reflection on the windows and half expecting a lime-green grasshopper to scare them shitless again, chairs with holes and ashes on pants.   he's taking her out on sunday..won't let her know what they're doing. her suspicion's aroused, curiosity killed the cat. ah, she'll be quiet then..and wait. and wonder.  hm.   "I care and I'm not just the flavor of the week trying to get in your pants."     oh?  :P  ---  the old man sleeps. awakens. smiles. cries.  the old man weeps.  the old man goes through things just like us..but he's wiser. more patient. slightly more mature about it, slightly more tolerant. enduring.  and so they smile again. they giggle. in their tiny little girl voices they say thank you.  thank you 'daddy'.  ---  the mother arrived safely in london today. me dad's lonely, called at some godforsaken time to talk...chit-chat, you know, do the father-daughter thing. and i know how that feels, to feel lonely, so i woke my ass up and talked. and smiled. laughed.  and told him i love him.   it's been a while. in between all the bullshit that's been going on, we haven't really talked. and i mean talked, like superficial bullshit that didn't involve fucking up or feelings or other good silly shit of that nature. we forgot about soccer games (liverpool won. *BLECH*) and new hi-fi systems, or brand-new some new obsession furniture. my dad the artist, the business man, the church dude.  my dad, the super cool mofo.  ---  the other parents have now smelled the sneaky suspicion that she's moving out. she's yet to say anything, leaving hell's fire to when the birth mom arrives in two weeks. to when she returns back to school again, to when they regulate her medication, to when they go to the doctors, to when they settle her transcripts.  mail arrives, letter after letter...of confirmation and receipts.   she's moving up. growing. independence.  or so she thinks..  running?  not really, just striving.  ---  she lies down, head on pillow and bolster by the side. watching tv together: strange reports, complete with sarcastic comments. they go through lists at hot or not; bitch, nit-pick, laugh, ogle.  a lazy afternoon, half slept away into tranquility though she's only had two hours.  sleep deprived,  she left the girl sleeping in her bed at half past ten this morning..went to church to practice her solo. this should be interesting..  singing. god. witnessing. emotions.  hm.  came back in an hour later, fixed lunch and plans for tonight. perhaps get her nails done later...dinner tonight.  then the girls want to do something.  and maybe kidnap blue-shirt and barker again.  hm.  :P

      my hands caress her soft, smooth skin...her tiny frame and the rich glowing tan, her supple breasts so round and full, erected as she arches with desire. aroused and titillated, my tongue licks her every inch. from her equally frantic tongue, to the plane of her stomach, her protruding sexy hips as her clenched fingers scratch my back in desperation...her eyes roll back with pleasure. my name escapes her lips in a soft raspy breath, she chants, she sighs, she begs, she moans. deep cat-like moans that purr, she purrs to be filled. touched. made love to.  hard, raw, passionate, moans.  my lips trace the nape of her neck, planting kisses. sucking on skin. she is so damn sweet; her taste lingers in my mouth. her eyes flirt with mine as my tongue now finds her womanhood. her box. her opening. my hands massage her, my fingers explore her...she spreads apart further as she grabs at the sheets in the building climax, orgasmic. her voice is terse...her legs tense with desire...trying to be quiet against the hard cold tiles of the basement. lost in a foray of freshly laundered white sheets. it is cold, but her skin is moist...she is wet.  coming.  i scream  ...pleasurely.  wet.  horny.  climaxing.

      it's strange. a very weird feeling, i wonder if i've been here before..some very specific aroma in here, almost like saffron; distinctive smelling yet not pungent. not too suffocating. but it's nice...calming. :)  it's odd to not walk in a cloud of sadness, it's weird to not have a pressing need to comfort pain, i've moved on and today when you asked how it was i could honestly tell you i didn't know. didn't know because i haven't been there in a while, didn't know because i've cleared my list, didn't know because there are new people in my life and i don't feel guilty about it.  i still questioned though, i wondered...but then again, i've learned to understand that i always will.  curious bitch.  :P  so apparently the girls got uhm, "happy" last night..  lol  more episodes about the hockey boys and baseball dudes..she gets the sporty ones, i'll terrorize the artists. problem? where?  the interview went good though, much talk about tantalizing sounds and being anal perfectionists. his beats that bounced off mine, talk about photography and music. web sites and designs to impromptu sketching in the little six-by-six cubicle which then veered off to funky silly rhythms and machine dreams.  cups and cups of coffee swirling, steam filling up the room...amidst "intellectual" talk about the world. shoulder and neck; fingers explore, hands meet...midnight madness, falling asleep. dreaming.  bullfuckingshit.  horny.  puck slept in someone's bed last night.  lobster crawled in with red hair.  ginger stocked up with lips.  beauty decided canadians suited her better.  and barker? barker wrote inspirational emails last night. (thank you)  yet amidst it all, she dances alone.   seven hundred and sixty two matches, boys...girls...she smiles. tickled.  ego, head blown.  silliness.  hmm.  hungry.  hah.

         crying, tears drawn is nothing. you cry, but the tears can only get you so far. remembering; harping on disappointment and being angry at myself will only lead me into the golden gates of depression, will only spiral, lock me down further. actions, actions speak so much damn louder than words and that intricacy i have not mastered. that special transition into maturity, i have not learned. have not honed.  pick, i pick at mistakes but i don't put into proper going on. i don't put into sequences and revert back into fucking up, into breaking and tearing again.  it is not an excuse.  it is not an answer.   it is a decisions i do not put enough action into, a baseless dream i think about too much but put nothing into. irresponsibility is my middle name and i have lived up to it. screwing up again, my name is racheal. i beg with myself, my being, to do it. to do right. i don't talk to the ugly, consecrated, shitty reflection, the girl in the mirror. i talk to racheal khong, to all of me. to the living, breathing, walking, everything me.  harp on fixing, on finding for a solution. what i deem as an unexpected emergency, a surprise was a path, a walkway i subconsciously walked through. damnit, racheal, damnit.  strip pride and walk on fire. strip masks and walk with the truth. i am not who i think i am, i am not who i want to be, i didn't try hard enough, i didn't apply the same anal assholic torture i put my mental self through..into..i wrote it off. i fucked it up. on my own, i wrote this story.  it isn't an epic, it isn't just drama. it is my life. i struggled, it was my fault. i didn't try hard enough, i didn't prove my point. i didn't stand my ground.  i couldn't do it or i didn't do it.  my second chance: my last change.  i cry bring on the wrath but i'm afraid. terrified. i say lets deal with it but i want to hide. want to pretend but i know i must not. this limbo, this destruction, i played it on my own.  i have to take responsibility, i have to admit i'm wrong. i have to face the consequences.   this is who i am.  i have disappointed.  i am a disappointment.

      confessions are weird things..  there's an empty spot next to where i lie, some part of me searches. searches to be filled, be renewed...searches for something. something special that's going to complete the picture, my icing on the cake, the gold trimming..an understanding.  it's been a rather heavy day, a day filled with too many questions. what ifs. why nots. how comes.  i looked the other day, deep within into questions i'd been hiding a while. feelings i had suppressed.  i do want this.  i do want to try, fly, fall, crawl, climb.  it isn't easy. it isn't easy.  so dang hard.  so dang many things.  i strive to be responsible. to be an 'adult'. i get so sick of being a grown up sometimes, i get so sick of growing up.  don't you?  i get so sick of having to put the pieces together, having to mature through learning, having to brush off and say, it's okay.  i get so tired of saying it's going to be okay when i don't feel like being okay a while.  sometimes all you want is just to yell, to scream, to be as immature and as bratty as you can possibly be. to climb into daddy's lap and hide a while, be protected. feel safe.  the real world's too big.  too dangerous.  evil.  the real world seems way too strange. way too off-balanced.  i'm off-balanced.  ---  "princess's happy post"  so midnight football was interesting..  puck and talon had a blast.   what began as a couple of people(lol, like 20?) surged into a good number, but then again drawing random people from the dock was about half the fun...:)  being lifted and turned upside down though...now that was not.  and for that, /you/ still owe me cotton candy.  i had fun though, american football is a terribly brilliant concept.  run, dash, scream, hit, grab.  i like.  great on sand with waves crashing and club music in the background too.  i was going to say something about jc but then i realized that would have been too much time spent on it already and i might get my arse kicked.  but anyway  thesilygrashoper: Once upon a time In a dark world that reached beyond the boundries of earth, there was a spec of dust known as a pixie.  The pixies heart tried to bring her to places of grand splendor, but the pixies body trapped the heart and forbit it from going.  Till one day the pixie began to fight in an epic battle.  Trillions were lost in combat but the pixie and her heart prevailed along with a few others. These formidable allies to the pixie soon became part of her and thus without realizing it the pixies heart had tricked her into going to the magnificent place of wich she had been forbiden.  Her heart in essence had "been in the right place at the right time"  :)

      a lame attempt.  unleashing, as if orbiting into a swirl of known and unknown paths.  of knowing that the coffee as always, has two creamers and two packets of substituites but never quite sure how it will taste.  not quite distinctively sure of it's meanings.  it's representation.  contents no doubt pretty much the same...but no doubt, still questionable.  still pokable.  lingering...the mind wanders. the heart slices. the pounding ponders.  hm.

      notes on napkins and messages left on the phone.  the girl squeals.  he's learned to use her number.  he's learned to rub her the right way.  she giggles.  then smiles.  they meet.  his blue-gray eyes sparkle, glint...  another conversation.  a decision.  next!  :)  excited.  conceited.  selfish.  bitchy.  she plays.  she dates.  she emerges.  hell fucking shit yeah, she dances.  flirts.  puts herself out there...news travels fast doesn't it?  she's returned to the other side.  swings really..  she plays it her way now...  don't you dare try to stop her, take her down.  she's on a rampage.  she's on a high.

      lol, so we're playing midnight football at the beach tonight.   mmhmm.  get that straight, biatch!  :P  puck's posse against mine? HM.  the lesbos against the straights.  the opposing against the rights.  the ogle, ogle, google, run into her boobs, doogle.  it's a beautiful day outside too...the sun's all bright and cheery. barker and beret have gone fishing, lamed attempts at dragging my ass down to the pier has obviously not worked.   :P  persuasions of skinny-dipping and magnet-poling added with deep sea watching have failed...my ass is staying in my 'mermaid skirt' and smiling. watching. laughing.  it's a cute day outside...  so much so that we had mythology class out by the lawn....in one with the nature. our teacher with his flamboyant styles and a class full of, pardon the saying but, weirdoes..artsies, "interesting" people, people with brains spewing out of their ears, people with ideology myths and unrealistic notions..all bathed in the glorious wonder of nature discussing cheif seattle, and wordsworth, and my favorite monk of all times, francis.  opinions discussed. the honor students bring down the oldies and the little prep blonde "heeheehee" girls.   the old man listens to an argument about the appointment with the hairstylist. colors..cuts...dye jobs, foiling jobs, boob jobs, manicure...whatever you want really. all with a price. all with a date. all with a sacrifice.  my thoughts go ha ha ha, malboro lights does nothing for me...last box of the damn month. or week. i don't know.  trying to quit.   oh wait, screw that.  quitting.  i inhale, my lungs protest quite violently, my stomach churns, my throat bleeds.  i am an eight.  i am on a high.  i am falling.  flying.  crashing.  dancing.  feeling alive.

      ever feel like you're meeting all the right people at the wrong time?  or all the wrong people at the right times?  ever feel like you're not complete and empty?  ever stare blankly and cry wondering who you are...what you are..where you've been and how much more to go?  there are so many parts of me that wonder tonight, so many turbulent questions pounding..  i wrote this out earlier, but a mis-click of the mouse led to the whole entry being erased, vanished. lost into the deep dark world of the internet...and i wonder what i said. i know i cried through that, but i can't remember anymore. only that it was painful to write, to realize i'm changing.  i don't know if i like that.  i dont' know if i'm comfortable.  there's this whole new confidence in me that scares the hell out of me. i'm still insecure but it's a nicely balanced insecure, a down to earth modest insecurity as opposed to the destructive shit i'm used to. and that's weird...becuase i actually feel it, and live it.  it's as if i actually know i have a reason for being here, as if i have a right to this.  like i'm moving on or something and some part wants to cling on to familiarity so bad but the other just itching to go. the other mesmerized, amazed, excited.  so many people..  could it be?  it's as if a veil is lifted, a sheen is cleaned and i finally see.  i realize.  and then i know  i'm not that bad  i'm not that evil  i'm not that horrible  i'm actually kinda okay  kinda nice  i'm actually kinda worth it.  heart on the line again  hopes escalate weirdly  thoughts crossed  people come and go  interests and dislikes  turn ons and turn offs  acceptance.  it's strange.  confusing.  two in essence.  can it be?  i want to be completed.  i want to be loved.  i want to be me for me.  i want love.     ...i have it.  what now?  decisions.

      it's a quarter to six in what must be the strangest weekend i've had in quite a while..  of course, strange and racheal pretty much goes hand in hand together but yeah..  staying pretty much bed-ridden and trying to keep entertained in between all those hours can be pretty interesting. hell, i've not done anything remotely productive nor stepped out of the house to do 'fun' stuff since friday afternoon...minus of course the midnight run to wal*mart because hey, now that's just wal*mart and it doesn't count alright?  so after much persistence and sticks stuck up my arse, i posted my picture on hot or not on friday and the amount of shit that has emerged out of that has amused me endlessly.  the sudden cum well-thought out decision to start dating again just seems like a big hogwash laughing matter right now. holy mother of god, i am very tickled. it's silly, i run through these people that send me notes and emails and they have all these double matching blah which is just retarded.  it's cute though, and i just want to go awwwwwwwwwww.  see, there's this whole spectrum.  first we have the interesting ones. the ones with similiar interests, cute adorable sexy on the same level ones. the ones you have nice cute conversations with and get all flustered about..  then there are the drop dead gorgeous HELLO ones which are pretty much out of my league..the idiots with 9.8 ratings and i'm like...me? nahhhh...  then comes the best ones which are all about , what's up my pretty sexy gorgeous laydee, you be hooking up with me soon and we be chillin' sometime? okay, so i make a bad impersonation but you get the picture. the 'sex,sex,sex' ones and sleazy icky greasy dudes.  of course, there are also the 30-50 year old paedophiles that cite young girls in their profile send stupid messages which really just want to make you scream and shudder. gross.  apparently also, i attract the bondage, ropes, chains, group.  hm.  then of course, there are also those that just stalk you down.  *tsk* *tsk*  BOTH of you!  helllllpppp!!  hehe...weirdness.

      when i was younger, my mom always told me that if i had nothing good to say, to just not say anything at all.  and for the most part, i probably should have a lot to say except that there are a couple of things worrying me  the first being:  i threw up blood last night.   it's been going on for a while now except that last night really scared me more than the others. something doesn't feel right or at least soemthing seems to be sending off signals some where and so i'm a little worried...but i'm okay, i just don't want to go to the doctor's that's all.  i've been pretty lethargic the last couple of days with the bleeding and pain so it hasn't been too sunny on this side of the world. it's also been raining like a bitch so that hasn't helped any but oh well, no big deal. i'm a strong girl and damn, it's hard to kill me.  :P  and yes, i would know.  other than that, i had to cancel last night's dinner plans because getting up felt like an act of god much less cooking so that was kinda disappointing and liberating at the same time.  things are very strange right now, 'playing by ear' like somebody says and it gets kinda silly and retarded but it's interesting nonetheless.  i think i'm ready for a relationship...but i don't know if it's because something just feels so right when we're together or if i'm just plain lonely and tired of playing the single game. in the end, i do still want to have someone to come home to, someone to laugh with but most of all, someone to love.  i miss loving someone. caring for someone and going out of your way to make them happy you know? i miss the closeness of two beings, or the understanding and friendship of lovers. i miss having a lover.  i guess it's been a strange couple of days. i passed on swing dancing friday night and stayed at home again saturday and so that seems to have worried a lot of people. the crazy bitchy staying home on a friday night? holy shit fuck there must be something up! :P  though really, i just wasn't up for it. i've just been so tired and in pain, i'm either passed out numb, or cranky bitchy pain.  but i'm alright though.   it's hard to explain, but therapy the last couple of months have seemed to help quite a significant bit. is it just medication or is it because i'm able to think more rationally and in the right direction now? i don't know. but something has changed, and that change is weird.  different.  foreign i suppose.  sometimes it gets a little frustrating because this is so damn new to me. there are times where i really would like to just curl into a ball and lock myself away then sob endlessly but this whole being changed thing challenges to find another alternative because consciously, the tears don't come anymore. nor does the anger nor pain.  does that mean i don't get sad anymore?  (i wish)  it's just a few levels less depressive. a few levels not so bad.  but it still comes. no magic pill or anything, no fucking great epiphany, no amazing damn revelation but it's getting there...i'm getting there.  and that's very strange.  but then again, i'm strange.  :P  all of you have a safe weekend and drive safe okay?  hugs

      stolen from  urlLink jasmine:    1. What was the last song you heard?  liebestraume - juliet the orange  fucking great album..   2. What were the last two movies you saw?  catch me if you can / drumline  it's a wednesday night thing at silverscreen, cheap three dollar tickets + snacks.  cute little quaint theater with old re-runs and funky ass paintings..rituals honey, it's all about the rituals.  oh, and not to mention the sexy boy that works there too. :P    3. What were the last three things you purchased?  ooh! ooh! we went to this craft shop last night and it had all these amazing textures, colors and materials in it. bloody a-wow! (kinda like an independent hobby-lobby?)  hm.  this tube top..pink + white + orange!  and uhm. does coffee this morning count?  (p/s can you tell i've had coffee? :P)   4. What four things do you need to do this weekend?  study for midterms. finish up all my half-assed art projects i've been doing but have been procrastinating over. WORK OUT! make dinner tomorrow night.    5. Who are the last five people you talked to?  amanda ryan lindsay lindy daniel  hmm...look what i just found in 'drafts'..   "[12/7/2002 11:36:09 PM | + racheal] i hesistate to use love. love is...shit, let's not even go there. but it's kinda interesting you know?   when he respects you for who you are even if he doesn't necessarily agree with the things you do or the opinions you stand for.   when he tells you you're beautiful even after you've had the world's most insane assholic day and your hair isn't even apart of your own anymore, your black shoes against your brown bag put together in the bare five minutes you had this morning, your nails chipped and your eyes tired, your mood horrific, your menstrual cycle being all hormonal and shit, he smiles, hugs you and you suddenly forget why you were so bitter and angry with the world and smile.   when you're laughing so hard your guts hurt and you can pillow fight and play 123 with your thumbs in the middle of nowhere. when you're lost in your little world and he's in it. or when you're in his little world he's sharing with you.   when it's three in the morning and you're having a nervous breakdown, he drives right over even if you've repeatedly said no but secretly wanted him to. talks to you and calms you the fuck down then makes ramen noodles together with you and tucks you into bed.   when you roll over to find his arms locked around you and tranquility washed over his face. safe protective arms that hush you from a bad dream, cuddles you in and kisses the boo boos away.   when you're watching him play and all these people shout and scream for him and that immense pride in you that goes, that's my baby! and the secret part of you that takes a deep breath and goes, whoa.   driving home, literally, figuring out the stick shift because he's let you touch his other love of his life and is now laughing at your silly face in bfn mobile trying to get home with the engine choking and dying on you about a million times saying clutch baby, clutch!   having real conversations about god, and dreams and 'real' things then making fun of 'superficial' and rather retardedly, talk about shopping and manicures and stupid crazy shit like that.   but most importantly, coming home and finding that he's found your favorite game, the one you used to play when you were little, and there's that look in his eyes that spells out how much you mean to him. and it's crazy.   when he says i love you for the first time and your heart melts.   when actions truly speak louder than words.   that's love. "   *sniggers.*  muahahahahahhahahahahahaha.  :P

      twelve hours later.  my head finally touches the pillow, my fingers tap the keys and my eyes finally start to open. to see. to watch again.  i finish up my half-written post from the afternoon before and smile to myself.  a night out, an escapade.   flirting with the dangers of brinking on insanity. drama. music. dancing. singing. stripping butt naked in the middle of the street.   commando style.  it's been an interesting night.  the boy scores a home run.   the girl runs an extra lap.  the kids celebrate.

      i deal with being me everyday...sometimes it is not so much a task, and i actually do have fun. sometimes i smile, and the girl in the mirror smiles back at me too...then we hold hands and walk forward. yet sometimes, sometimes it gets really hard. sometimes she points out things i force myself to be oblivious to and i battle her demons..i reach for her heart that bleeds so damn desperately and horridly, but it is never just an episode or a continuation, it is a frame found in seconds and minutes from time. from life. from trying, then trying again.   i wallow in depression, in disorders and in 'state of minds'. diseases that invade my thinking space, uninvited ghosts that haunt me..destroy me.   i cry and hurt and fall and bleed.   i brush and smile and laugh and dance.  i live in different extremes and so many times i crouch into a ball, my fetal position and cry why me? why me? why me?  then i tear my being apart and forget.  and grow cold.  numb.  my obsessive compulsive, manic depressive, bulimic retarded self brushes off the ickiness and finds hope.  the problem is...i always find hope.  i always get back up.  i always swing and traverse and try again.  for the most part, that is solitarily my biggest frustration.   to fly and fall and have no space in between.   ---  george winston plays softly in some realm between reality and my world. my universe out of these four walls. out of this space that comforts...protects me.  rubbing out x-es and crosses.  stamps.  ink on the back of my hand.  marked.  the clock reads 3:58 in the morning, i lug in reels and reels of excess baggage..of change and make up.  my body screams physical torture, my mind yells for attention of it's own and my brain demands for an all-nighter for the mid-terms tomorrow.  a scene prepared, a story read, a math exam formulated.  time to live in mythology land a while, time to escape reality.  time to discover mnemosyne.

      so it was ryan, puck and i last night.  terrorizing the old man with seven hundred and fifty two voice messages that span from orgies from the back seat, to cheers, to foreign jabber that only happens at three in the morning.  by the time we'd left to all drive home, catatonia was playing about tinkerbell and the sun had already risen. the new waitresses from the next shift had already come around and dusk had somehow metamorphosed into dawn.   we laughed so hard, peed so hard and buzzed.  highs from a million things, the rehashing and relayering of a thousand stories, a million tragedies, a trillion connotations.   an it was like swimming in a mind of absolute extremes. silliness, kookiness, intelligence, retardedness and horniness.  and kinkis.  lol.  good night out..whoop.  hm.  i'm in the honors room and everyone around me is diligently studying for the mid-terms and i'd rather just jump on the table and just go shoop ba dah doo wop.  whoop. whoop.  hehe...seville tonight!  :)

      so we had this conversation about god today..  me, the old man and puck.  puck the christiany christian god believing-saving wonderful saintly one.  old man, the atheist something that sounds like antagonist spiritual non-believing dragon slaying one  and me, well, me.  me the, i'm not really sure where i stand person.  the i know there's a god but i'm not exactly sure what my thoughts on it are...  it's that questioning of faith that people go through...the change from where a devout believer learns to ask? learns to contemplate. learns to wonder..  am i good enough? is there really someone out there? does he see me? does he listen?  how?   what?  where?  when.  and then the questions role around again and i wonder.  i question.  i float around and twist around in circles and get dizzy.  lost.  but i know...and i believe.  i understand.  i just don't know where i  stand .  questioning....like bisexuality really.

      i'm uncomfortable.   investigative reporting seems very wrong to me. or let me rephrase that, the article i'm doing and it's consequences is not exactly something i'm comfortable with. perhaps it is because i don't believe in it enough, that i cannot really get the complete feel for it. the angst behind it. the full-out passion towards it to question.  i've grown up in a country where you don't ask questions. really, you just don't.  they shoot you for that shit.  they put you in jail with all these internal security acts.  i am not used to this freedom of speech...not used to questioning out loud.  sure, i am not the easiest person to get along with. sure, i am loud, bitchy and have an opinion with just about anything but to write it down? to put it out? to give it to an audience?  do i want to.  oh wait, can i not?  no.  and that's a hell no for you.  i talked to my teacher about it. but he's seems very set on having me do the story. the big drama hoo-ha piece. and i want to say thanks but no thanks.  but it's a class.  and i need the credit.  and it's part of the finals.  it just seems so 'wrong'.  like swinging a carrot in front of the donkey to lead it to the slaughter house.  gah.  ...journalism bing bang kiss my ass.  harrumpphh.

                 i swear there is nothing like going to watch a hockey game and retreating to the sports bar downtown later with our very own private party.  very interesting.  rest assured, there were more than enough numbers to come out through me arse.  :P  and amanda's rendition of the star spangled banner?  bloody amazing.  and the look on their faces?  fucking a priceless.  old man has the pictures though...perhaps when he returns my lipstick i'll confiscate some of the pictures and post it.  yummy canadian hockey boys.  very subdued almost cold, mean and bitchy racheal.  very rough waves @ beach.  very pleasant memories rehashed.  wet.  memories.  :P  but anyway;  three cars.  four girls.  a baseball team.  eye contact.  an ice hockey game.  lots of cheering.  screaming.  yelling.  stomping.  a couple of random phonecalls.  strip poker.  dollar bills.  stalking.  cheap throw-away kodaks.  expensive retarded working digital cams.  good time.  wah bah dah boo bop.  and on another note though, what the hell is it with the almighty shitty weather?

      i'm changing.  i'm not quite sure how much i like that but i'm changing. i've changed.  ...i'm different. i can't define it really, just that i feel it in my soul, that deep within me it rumbles and  i know .  sometimes i pretend not to notice, not to care. sometimes i just shrug it off, as if it is just another piece of this whole great puzzle of life. this inter-changeable correlation of depth and perception, another stage, another turning point...just another significant change of course.  another walkway...another journey...another road to be taken. traversed. lived.  i am proud of me, and the things i have achieved. i am proud of the person i am now...the person i've honed, mended, fixed and am working on. the person i've been working on for eighteen years and the funny thing is that i can lie here and tell you, you know what? it's not that bad. i'm not that bad.  ...and  that's  a good feeling.  but sometimes, sometimes though i miss my old self.  i miss the dork. the stupid silly sensitive person in me that tries to save the world. the part of me that's so god damn naive it's incredible. i miss crying alone in the middle of the night, that after feeling of a good cry. that after feeling of knowing it can only get better from here. getting back up, putting back both my feet on solid ground and standing. smiling.  there's something distinctively missing in me. that feeling. passion.   selfishness.  greediness.  that voice that tears you apart is the very same voice that drives you and i have lost that edge. or at least my heart seems to have kept it away a while.  i am calm. almost numb.  i am dying.  and i'm not afraid anymore.  and that scares me.  i've changed.

      twelve hours later, she sits with a bowl of lightly salted-fat free-buttered popcorn and wonders what it would be like to recreate snow and toss the whole bowl into the air.  ...that and she hasn't had enough of sleep nor does she make sense.  she alternates between outfits and has her nails done. soaks in a bathtub and relaxes in bubble salts and bath oils. big night out tonight, puck's big day and half the world is coming out to see her. mardi gras game and party afterwards.  proud of the girl and wants to smile nice and big just for her.   'things happen for a reason'   more things to do, more people to see, more shit to antagonize.  but she's good.  and she smiles.  and she dances.  weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.  :P

      she's happy, then sad...in between, then silly-giggly laughy again.  betrays her inner sanctions and reaches for tiny capsules. it's like being diabetic really they tell her, they need their insulin and she needs her saratonin. just a disease, another cancer..just life.  starving at three in the morning. an empty stomach with acid gurgling away; her demons torment her yet she pleasantly resists. fucks with them and tells them to go to bed. she talks to no one and to herself, her four walls. locks herself in a villa with no windows encapsuled in her mind.   conversations vary and people interchange.   bitter sad tears bite behind her eyes but then she smiles again.  she's retarded.  she's "special".  she's just her.    hm. time for some scrabble/literati kicking..

       "If she digs you because you KNOW you dig her. You dig her chili sooooooooo goddamn much. And you don’t want her to know it. You don’t want her to know you think of wrapping her in your arms, caressing her hair and her back, parting your lips to welcome hers. Because women,….. well they can smell an agenda. They can smell fear. And they can smell desire. J’elle desire. J’elle desire beaucoup. Mais je….Je ne sais pas…..Je suis stupide"   it's that giggly stupid feeling that makes you walk down the hallways with a grin the size of your ass. a smile that floats you through the day and a laugh that completes you.  it's that smug smile you give him when he asks 'what's up sunshine?' and you just giggle and laugh somemore. smiling.  yet it's that feeling that rumbles deep inside that wonders..  why me?  how?  where?  what?  which cosmo, which deity, which goddess shines down on me today?  the enticing aroma that swirls through with you, his aura that glides off yours and god, that fucking eyes.   that face.  his smile.  touch.  shivers...your body floats in ecstacy and all senses are in overdrive.  you play the uninterested bitch but oh my god, if only he knew the way your heart pounds against your chest and the squeals that go off in your head when he comes to find you. and you are noticed. and you are complimented. and you are appreciated.  the thrill of the chase. the hunt. the starry look in his eyes that makes you question in amazement, me?  little things that you slowly learn about each other, it's beautiful how things correlate.  he's in the class next door now. thirty minutes. he's 'walking me to my next class'. and we're doing 'lunch'...(or coffee).  i can't remember what he's wearing. it's ironic how people get so enthralled they remember every fucking thing in detail...he can tell me what i wore the first time we met (?) but i only remember how nice he was. his smile and those damn eyes. piercing through...and meeting again.  i can only remember the hush of his voice this morning and the way his face lit up walking towards him.  and i smiled.  i graced.  i played it 'cool'.  really.  and here i am...  freaking out.  weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!  "details girlfriend, details."  :P

      it's been a tranquil quiet day today. peacefully calm almost. kinda like a la-di-da day for myself; not a giggly moronic hyper one nor a depressed the world is a bitch fuck day...just a nice. swooshie day.  :)  well, i also did only get up at noon so only having half of the day to deal with might have something to do with it too..  hm. went to the gym and got out all the bad chi by running for about half an hour than taking it out on the machines. if my muscles hurt like crap tomorrow, i'm just going to laugh instead. it was good though, needed to sweat things out?  i lost two more pounds. yay racheal. :) my weight's been fluctuating so weirdly in the last couple of weeks i think it might have been detrimental to my health...or was it the other way around? whatever.  went over a couple hundred of math questions at the math lab with robert for the test tomorrow... now hopefully, i will kick ass. and if i don't, oh well, i tried. :P  f circles fucking g and it's domain? gah.  i did finish up my paper at barnes and nobles though. which is quite surprising really considering that about everyone and their asses were out there 'studying' too. hehe, i didn't mean to be rude but damn, if you have a 1800 word paper to be completed by tonight and you're starting from scratch, hell yeah you'll be taking your fat yellow behind to the corner and hiding with your mugs of coffee too.  lol, you know you're habitual when the girl at the counter recognizes your order and the boy that makes it asks you why you weren't here the other day.  but i like my rituals thank you very much.  important lesson of the day?  aurora was a fucking nymphomaniac and nymphomaniacs are very  very  different from kleptomaniacs.

      coming home, i had so much to say to you. so much i would yell and scream at you for.  but then i figured it wasn't worth it.  you made your choices.  you chose your actions.  you voiced your opinions.  i am pissed.  i am livid.  i am angry.  i am furious.  but   shit yeah  it hurts.  you're a fucking fool.  i hope you just realized what an ass you were tonight, i take account for the inebriated bitch i was, but jealousy is really an ugly green monster.  not the first time, not the second, won't be the last either.  i have an ex boyfriend to play games with me with.  so no thank you on the offer.  no thank you on being yelled at.  no thank you on being treated like dirt.  no thank you for feeling like dirt.  sod the hell off for all i care.  the ironic thing would be, it's funny how i had so much fun tonight.  hugs, dancing, bouncer-ing, hanging out with your friends...chilling. at ease. smiling.  you peeled out, perhaps only to reconfirm my thoughts on what jerks men can be. perhaps it never crossed your mind that my feet hurt, my brains were tired, and i only live 23 miles away. perhaps it never crossed your mind that other than a few frat parties here and there plus the random get together, i knew no one. perhaps it never crossed your mind that as much as i asserted the cold bitch can take care of herself doesn't need anyone role that i was still a girl. and i still have no fucking damn idea how to get home from fox run and god only knows with the directions.  i admit to being slightly more intoxicated than i probably should have been. i admit to submitting to horrible disgusting cancer sticks, hell, i even admit to warming up, getting to know people, talking to people instead of giving people the 'leave me alone, don't touch me, what are you looking at' stare.  my point would be tonight i put myself in your shoes. and instead of just humoring myself and you, i let go. i realized what a fucking amazing person john is, and how fucking sweet (and sexy) brian is, i ogled at becky's turkish belly dancing, and made a conscious damn effort to be nice to everyone. to not be a wallflower and stick with my posse. you'll blame the evil bottles but go figure. tonight, it wasn't so much of an effort anymore, but that i enjoyed it.  i understand where you're coming from but do you see where i come from too?  i'd give you that much credit for coming back.   but hell, to sit forty-five minutes in the car with someone that was going to go at eighty miles an hour and be pissed at me? been there, done that.  i'd give you that much credit on checking to see if amanda came to get me.  but what if she wasn't around? what if the boys were fucking god know whats and i didn't get home safely. would you have a conscience?  i wonder sometimes.  and so as you sit there, sulking, reading this.  ( lie one: you do read the site..i know computers remember? ask brian/john/chris sometime about referrals, site tracking and cache files. )  go figure why i looked the other way when you said you were sorry.  go understand why i'm pissed.  go try and rationalize my immaturity against your outburst.  go shit yourself because i'm not just a thing with legs and arms.  i'm human and you hell fucking know i'm sensitive.

      i've been having dreams lately..extremely strange dreams.  take for example the other night's dream. somehow, with chris leaving and everything, he'd magically appeared to have been working in the same office with me. now, if you want the major flaws in that dream it's:  i. we're not even in the same line, let alone fucking country! ( london  yorkshire and florida? hm.)  ii. come on, me at a 9 - 5 job?!?  well anyway, apparently i wasn't too flustered by these facts and it was quite normal. hell, we even had coffee breaks in it. gen, his p.a. was in it too and something around a book my dad had published, 'if i really wanted to be happy i would..." something-something and my new stiletto shoes. la di da.  strangeness, chris was in a suit too.  i must say though, it was a cute little office. lots of people, plants, funky colors and hip furniture.  :)  which brings me to the next dream..  apparently the girl and i are now 'attached'  and we have this beach house..it looks like something out of a miami home, a massive slab of concrete with about a hundred different gazebos and additions. it's fucking gorgeous and it's this yellow-okra-orange color with a pool that has a waterfall in it(?) too much of mtv cribs for racheal i say..  we alternate between walks at the beach during sunrise/sunset and midnight runs while talking to random strangers and we seem perfectly happy making dinner together. we bake cookies and chop up vegetables while the curry (yes, curry.) simmers on the stove. i am happy and she's smiling and it's strange.  and at night we curl up together and fall asleep to the waves crashing...and when i wake up in the middle of the night, i'm not there anymore.  instead, i'm in my room.  alone.  cellphone flashing voice messages.  the clock reads 3:49 and i don't know if it's night or day because all my blinds are shut and my body feels heavy, as if i've slept forever.  i'm still tired and so i spend the next few minutes in melancholy before sleep sets in again and i''ve escaped.   and now this escape has revolved into a party somewhere and lots of smoke, completely drunk asses and loud music. we're dancing and walking our sorry intoxicated loud selves around, these are all familiar friends and everyone has a joke(or jokes) to tell. we're laughing ourselves silly and the added alcohol in the system plus random tiredness at what seems to be dawn only adds to the 'good time'.  we have a waitress, and perhaps we're in a mixture of nouvo and fridays. our crackers are stale (i had stale japanese crackers in real life yesterday) and the bitching starts. we ring up the manager and complain about such poor service...our dinner's taken too damn long to arrive and the mics don't work. (karaoke?) we make noise but in drunken stupor, enjoy it anyway.  the time frame changes and so has the location apparently. it looked like brian/wayne/john/chris's apartments at first...somehow, it's become this lavish posh house. don't ask me, my brain cells are overworked...that's why i cna't tell my head from my ass...but anyway, the party is over. it's messy and there are beer bottles all around, i'm passed out on the couch. tired and inebriated. soft jazz music plays from this amazing surround sound system by the corner. we've come home and continued apparently, and it's quite a pretty though sterile house. very modern. steel and pewter all around.   well anyway, friend of a friend of a friend's competitor is here. he's picked me up to tuck me in and my half-asleep brain tells him to climb into bed with me. even in drunkness, she's lonely...afraid of being alone. hmm.  he comes into bed and we are cuddled together. i start telling him that this doesn't mean a thing, that it's just for mental purposes and not heart...and if there was a climax in the dream it would be this. i open my eyes to see him again and i see pietro.  it is that same exact feeling. telling him it meant nothing and that i wasn't ready for a relationship. all that good stuff and platonic crap.    then i get up, sober now? and walk out.  alone.   now, there are about a million metaphors and subconscious meanings in the dreams but holy damn fuck mother of god.  no more sleeping for racheal.  too overrated.  grr.  :)

      my body feels physically whacked. like if i had to sit down and list down everything that was misfunctioning and fucking up, i wouldn't know where to begin.   and so i lie, half on my back, half to my side, trying to ignore the pain and strong urge to run myself against a wall. hell knows, we don't need any more repeats of the tylenol incident so i'm 'roughing it out'. really.  i just got off the phone with 'her'.   i remember her smile. my little prep 'friend'. i swear my face lit up like a light bulb when i saw her today...in the midst of all the chaos with curly sue and puck, navarre bum and the rest of the acting group....she saunters in in all her glory and goes, 'baby...'  she holds me from behind and hugs my waist as she watches me get ready. i hate running late but she says no big deal, plays with my makeup...dances around to the lame-ass (i'm pathetic) sappy country station i've set it to before that song comes on. our eyes meet and i don't know whether to cry or scream so i kiss her instead.  we forget about the little tiff, a fight about nothing because she's leaving...and i'm staying. because this casual fling has taken a new adjustment and it's hard letting go...about being angry with each other and no one.  monday. monday. monday.  you know how i emit that bitchy, cold exterior? she plays that well...inside, she's this sweet, amazing, loving, kind person but somehow, she enjoys the company of the ice princess. my walking gap commercial strutting her sexy self...i show her off at the theater tonight as if she is my prized possesion. i want to say, look at us! look at us! i want to say, mine! mine! mine! and spell out r-a-c-h-e-a-l-'-s on her forehead and tell the idiot guys to stop making passes and it's rude.  we walk to the parking lot and i have to send her home. i almost want to cry, it's so hard to say goodbye. but i tell myself i'll see her tomorrow...and sunday.  but what about monday?  and tuesday?  and wednesday, thursday, friday?  she says we can make it work if we want to. and i want to. but i don't. but i do. and i don't.  so i walk back alone into the theater and slip on the smiley face and drive over to the cast party with the old man. ah..the old man. the old man did an eeriely fucktastic job today, i was scared. scared of death and of seeing my friends acting out death because death has been so imminent in my thoughts.  now i sit here giggling because when as she was pulling away after her goodbye kiss, she said the magic words.  perhaps i realize now, you don't choose love but that love chooses you.  which reminds me..  how in the hell did i ever get this lucky?

      sometimes, i wish to see what others see in this world, wish to hear what sounds they listen to and wish to feel what things that inspire them. change is inevitable and a subtle flow of picking metaphorical instances that create rhythm in the beauty of life and the ever-present feeling of discontinued murmurs, an ever-present crochet of patched quilted dreams bottled up through see-through glass, waiting to shatter and spill over.   boundaries are where you set them and the things i see, the things i hear, and the things that inspire me i know, are the things that truly make me unique and special, "special" for just i am. and sometimes, just sometimes, you find the faces that know the crevices of your heart, the visions of your soul in a crowd. and it's at these times that you see it is the bond that links and represents you in this world. this universe.

       paper journal blog entry   so we're back to this existence; and i write again using the same typeprint i've forgotten a while..it still comes easily though, almost fluidly...perhaps old habits truly die hard. i almost sent a text message last night that i would have regretted, in between puck's panic attack, sexy pants tryst with jumpoffit and the booming and tinkering of bizarre sounds that vibrated beneath us of a plethora of senses being kicked into overdrive and random drag queens strutting their stuff with dollar notes flung into the air : almost home they say, a certain paradise..  i might have been lying to myself a while, really desperately, wanting to believe but the subconscious mind is a brilliant thing innit?  i'm falling asleep writing this, my eyes are droopy and the pain killers are setting in. aroma fills the cafe as notes are sprawled all over the table and joints are weary exhausted; gap box lying on a chair next to my purse with it's new treasures inside. this boy,  a little muscular, a little yummy looking sits across the room from me but i catch him stealing glances and i smile. in barker's orange cargo pants with it's straps and ties and velcro that makes this swish-strraachh--wishy-washy sound and a tied black shirt with sleeves pushed up to show my new tan and the glistening diamond star of my belly button ring. black framed glasses and the customary silver jewelry: hoops, bracelets, rings, with and a manicure of striped lavender shades lined down with crystally sparkly things. lotus position, back to the math and mythology notes, back to the comparison of mamet and beckett, back to debating contemporary ethics and the law of the media industry.  a sip of coffee and soft jazz music that plays subtlely in here yet clearly, soothingly. rumbles and mumbles of discontinued chatter that fills the air, a picture of barker fixing a bath for us and nynkempoops curls, the indistinct scent of fresh flowers and the yellow-orange golden hues of a sunset at 6:49.  the day coming to an end and a night just beginning of journeys, of hopes and of dreams. cackles and silly giggles ensue, yummy boy heads to the table and i'm seeing the head doctor tomorrow. i have a feeling she might be impressed.   =)

      so it's a quarter after ten, and i stink of ralph lauren.  :)  on the way out to the cast meeting and waiting for sexy pants to come pick me and puck up. it's been a long ass crazy day, got my classes for the fall registered and had a nice long pleasant talk with mr. cashwell. changed my major and rethought the direction of my life and where these currents were taking me. confirmed my plane ticket and picked up a couple of books, redrew money and wrote a nice long entry in my journal. attempted to paint a little before paramedics got way too exciting and distracted the heck out of me, the medicine field is so damn interesting...perhaps later in life when i've achieved all my immediate dreams i will pursue that. you never know. i have one long ass running post right now, typing as fast as i can and making four hundred and fifty two typos in between.  i get to see the chick! i get to see the chick! later anyway, work first then comes the pay off.   damn, gotta go get my dollar bills.   heh.  i look hot tonight, and you know what? i know it.  :) whoop. whoop.

      yes, i am pretty darn good at putting off things eh?  i suppose i could tell you about my day and rant about my scene and acting and the theater scholarship la di da. then i could also tell you about how old man's gone to tampa and the weather is being a bitch and sexy pant's at the beach with seizing people or about the talk with ninkempoop this morning and her fucking unbelievably sexy new hair and the way it smells and you just have to take a whiff of it as she leans in close to give you one of those hugs in which you nonchalantly just smile and laugh with her.   or i could tell you about chick from emerald city and how we're going to see her tonight. dancing. talking. laughing. hobbling around and sometimes how things seem so right and so wrong at the same time. i suppose there's always the infamous barker and how we've fallen into this sorta odd existence. a booty call here and an intrusion of space there, it's wonderful and magical and silly and stupid and taxing in it's own little ways. some days, it feels as if we're growing apart and some like the other night, feels as if we've just gotten to know each other and i can't wait to get to know him more. discover him further.  then there are others, perfect moments in which everything is right and so damn good it's not just about making love to each other anymore or having another body to curl into to sleep at night. there are times where everything is held on a pedestal and as if a symphony as been unleashed into a catastrophic melody that just plays so damn right but yet it's wrong. there is friction, and sometimes it's sexual tension...like trying to make love with your clothes on and the build up to it where it all explodes into a huge giant collaboration of rhythms and movements, in, out, around, licking, teasing, wanting, needing, fucking, grabbing, holding back, stopping, coming together.   it's odd in a good and bad way, but shit like that, i should know by now should just be left unanalyzed.   :)  in any case though, i have a cast meeting tonight. and maybe we'll go home, or maybe we'll meet at waffle house and share a drink together, or then again maybe we'll just talk on the phone and share a ciggarette later.   he leaves in a couple of weeks, and so do i. we've shared our worries and hopes and dreams, praying they'll all correlate and work out somehow. that there is somehting bigger out there and that we will reach the infinite beyond.   times when he tells me he's lonely, my heart breaks and i wish he'd had things i've been blessed with that we both know i take for granted, and so in those very moments that i look back upon right now, i realize. i am selfish, and i am very far from perfect...but that i haven't turned out yet and i'm going to.  i've done well for two weeks without the head doctor and the strange beautiful thing is that it shows. i look back at the pictures from the other night and i see so many things and sometimes, i think maybe, it's just me but it's magical when someone else looks at it and says you've changed. and says you're going to do well. and says you're worth it, you're beautiful, you're special.  and for those moments, it carries you through because you do feel special and you are.   i'm looking forward to being with the kids again, i suppose they keep me grounded. i run through a battery of tests when i go home but the kids keep me strong because for every one procedure i go through, they try and make through ten.   i'm going home to work, to be with my friends again, to prove to my family that i can make it...that all the times they've believed in me, that all the times they've stood by me is paying off. that i'm going to be just fine and that i'm doing just fine. that while they may still worry, it isn't so much a concern anymore, i'm determined as hell to cross this road, i'm determined as hell to make it.  i've learned to speak up, to stand up; to say this is how i feel, this is what i want to do and this is what i'm going to do. i've learned that there are times i should not take no as and answer and times i have to get off my ass and realize i'm not the only person in the room, that i have to accept things and situations and people for just who they are.   life hands you lemons, you make lemonades. life hands you racheal, you smile, kick back, yell, scream, cry and dance.   look mama, i'm making it.   i have straight a's for a course i thought i'd never survive, i'm on the honor's roll for something i thought i'd never get my shit together enough to achieve, i'm offered jobs people only dream of having, i have friends that go to hell and back with me, for me, and because of me. i have love, i have trust, and i have wants, and with all that is in front of me, all that is on my plate, i realize, i can't do this half-assed, i can't do this half-way because life's thrown me opportunities, talent, and chances i should never take for granted.   because i've finally reached a stage where i'm growing up and hopefully, blossoming into an adult with worth, integrity and maturity. or so that's the plan anyway.   how's that for monday afternoon thinking?  ...time to watch some cartoons.

      so the much awaited, planned surprise party for madonna was last night. aptly themed the infamous pimp and ho party, it was quite interesting with three drag queens, spoonfulls of altered sexual preference and very very plastered people.  i've just gotten off the phone with steve. holy mother of god, this day is strange.   i suck at this blogging thing, i'm beginning to lose interest in it and have instead preferred writing, lately, in my journal. hand-written shit just seems more honest, open, and sincere. i'm doing pretty good and i still have a couple of stupid moments but other than that, it's been going pretty steadily.  things seem to be tying in together and i don't have much time for anything but that's not such a bad thing because it isn't a chaotic type of shit but rather a nice flowing series of events in an odd kinda way.   i sit here listening to the radio, my staple of pop and part of me can't stop smiling, grinning, and the other cries because it's overjoyed, loved, frustrated, confuses, worried and happy. it's a beautiful night, and the stars are shining brightly...everyone, for the most part, are doing pretty well.   summer rolls in and this computer hums to a tune of it's own, fresh roses fill the room...this is peace. security. tranquility.   this is the life.   my life.  and i am thankful.  thank you for being a part of my life for a while...i think i might go off for a bit. finals are this week and i might just go around the country a bit, see some parts of the world, live in a different culture fr a while...perhaps discover myself. perhaps share my life with someone else. let someone in and all that crap.   redesign in about a week or so and perhaps an update or two from wherever the wind takes me.   i'm coming home and i'm kicking ass.

      i forgot what we call keith here, hm. how about sexypants? lol, well anyway, sexy pants and i went out shopping yesterday. very very fun, and definitely lots of interesting buys not to mention silly laughs but all good though.   we picked up a couple of things for barker, curiousgene, old man, madonna and 'chick from emerald city'. heh. chick from emerald city story later. but yeah, my thoughts are all sporadic and spastic today, been waking up and going to bed at absolutely strange hours, and in between going home to barker and going home to bum fuck alabama..it's been a ride. :P  ooh, so here comes the part where i rant and gush about barker.   guess what that silly dumb sweet ass did? heh. (no, i'm not telling them about  that  silly. :P)  we went shopping the other day, just out of random boredom on the way home from his place, and i'd picked out this pretty little sundress and a pair of white capris to go with it. the semi indian dothi looking thing for summer you know? but yeah, stupid me didn't have much cash on me and i've always had my thing about getting people to pay for me so to make the long story short, i only got the dress and only told that to barker later.   so fast forward a couple of days and in between kayaking, canoe-ing, tubing, and random accidents of fate, barker springs on the surprise yesterday and yanks out my pair of apparently very hard to find white capris! woooo...two points for the boy! and it the right size too!  :)  now is that just not absolutely adorable or what?  *insert a fit of silly giggles*  hmm...barker's on his way to orlando for a day and i'm feeling lonely. when the 'boyfriend' is away can the pussy come out and play? *tsk* *tsk*  okay, enough of silliness...i meant to put in a serious proper update but i'm being distracted by seven hundred and fifty two people with four hundred and seventy six things that need to be done now.   will continue later....oh, and don't let me forget chick from emerald city!  :)  strange shit i tell ya, oh and bitch from the doctor's office too.   gah! so much to do, so little time!  whoop. whoop.  :P

      she hasn't been to bed since friday night, and at the wee hours of the morning at that. she's a little woozy, extremely exhausted, tired as fuck, a little melancholic and obtusely content, pleasantly appeased and somehwat satisfied. she likes the waves she's riding on right now, the way in which her currents flow.   she went out with the girls last night. the three of them versus the whole of pensacola and their mothers at the boardwalk by the beach. they salsa-ed, merengue-d, hip-hopped, booty danced, ass-humped, flirted, seduced and ran away. convinced though that virtually every man above the age of thirty tried to pick her up that night...must have been the asian porn star look she was going for. :P  they stopped by at blue shirt's first to kick things off though, chinese boy and a couple of his frat buddies and little sisters were there and in an odd sort of way, it was interesting. but as usual, three pms-ing women put together? drama. big fucking oh my god drama. nothing new though, nothing new.   typical even, to a certain extent, laughable. laughable because it was so silly and getting old? or laughable because she figured hey, let's not ruin the rest of the night eh...i don't know. questionable.   next stop on the way was barker's. stealing her ciggarettes back and sneaking in a rose while he was at work...which of course then went on to stopping at his work place to say hey baby. to say hie sexy. to say, just felt like seeing you. confirm plans. talk a little. watch you smile a while. :)  fuck the rebel flags dude, look what i scored.   then when all hell was done breaking loose among the girls, they headed to the beach.   ah, but i digress.  something was up with old man last night too though. so many things on his mind, so many thoughts, so many indecisions, so many feelings and so much numbness. hard to find the words to say, afraid of threading on dangerous ground, of saying the wrong things, of aggitating him more. upsetting him. i love you though old man, no matter what. and i meant all that i said last night, you are the staple that holds together a lot of our lives and so incredibly special and loved to everyone of us.   and now that that mushy shit's over, fastforward to after the boardwalk. and the two guys that went to waffle house with them plus the dragging curiousgene and barker's ass out at four in the morning for a texas cheesesteak. it was good though, all good. very cute.   driving the girls home though, it was of utter importance to stop by at bedlums downtown and freeze our asses off waiting outside the club to meet their friends. yes, friends that also left me weird strange sexual messages on my cellphone at five in the morning. i should be flattered i suppose...still weird though. perhaps almost kinda freaky.   madonna ends up staying the night and right about when she's done with her bath and ready to curl into bed, it's time to leave. easter bloody sunrise. yay. literally home, bath, change, out.   and they ask her to read the scripture for the day, a special priveledge, an honor...and so she does. then rings daddy after that to say hie, happy easter and i love you.   drags madonna out of bed and drives them off to barker's place, heh. :) and she found her way too!  drama, drama, drama for the rest of the day. some fun, some scary, some different and some just plain silly. she had fun though, a lot of things ran through her mind, things she is at no liberty nor strength to talk about right now. she'll figure it out though, later, but for right now, she'd just like to curl up and die. pass out for exhaustion.   that would be nice wouldn't it?  :P  p/s don't you dare fucking die on me.

      hm..so it crossed my mind today that this will be the first easter in five years that i won't visit my grandfather's tomb. is that weird? is that strange? is that releiving?  i was painting easter eggs, and with all that time and dye on your hands you sorta let your thoughts wander around even with the tv in the background and screaming, crazy, hyperactive, adorable kids running around.  there are a lot of things that surrounded my grandfather passing away, his idiosyncracies, my grandmother, my father, the family, our doctor, my brother and just little quirks and painful remembrances that sorta hit you all at once. being at that place today reminded me of working with the kids at home and having to stay strong, stay happy, stay  altogether.   we'll see.   :)  in any case, have a great easter everyone.

(the lady in the tower)   Rapunzel...  She looks down from her high tower  The sun catches her face and kisses it all over  She shines and shines like a magical song  But her face is tear streaked  Like a porcelain doll  Weeping saltwater from its smooth perfection   And I just stand here  Looking up at her...  Looking up at her looking down on me  She talks to me  She talks to me like she's talking to a frog or An ant or a rock on the ground.  I might be a lost prince  but I am a prince no less  I should have worn my crown before I left my castle  Nevermind,  I like the way she sees through me as she talks  She's comforted with my voice  And the knowledge that I am listening to her   She is so alone and cold up in her lofty prison  Her tower is a wicked one  It holds her so tightly  That thoughts of escape do not exist in her mind  How can I make her see  That an escape is possible with me  I could carry her away from her tower  And even though I am lost now,  We will find our way together to another kingdom   Rapunzel, Rapunzel let down your hair...   The truth is, I am not a prince any more...  I ran from my land and burnt my crown  I have nothing left to lose  And I should be happy with what I have done unto myself  But nothingness makes a man hungry  So, my fair maiden, will you trust me ?  Do you, like me, ache to run from it all ?  You seem to think that I am a scoundrel unworthy  Who will cut or tear your sweet hair  But my lady I promise to be gentle, I swear  I will be a better man,  A more gallant prince  And I will be worthy  I will be worthy...    Rapunzel, Rapunzel let down your hair...   Let down your golden tresses,  I will climb up to your loft  And keep you warm  I will break down the doors which hold you there  Together we’ll escape the cruel tower  You will be free and I will be found  No longer lost or bound will we be   So, Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair   ---   Strings.   I lay her on my chest to feel my heart beat softly with hers,  I feel her soft weight upon me, her curves molding delicately with mine,  Our bodies/souls entwine in a beautiful three chord harmony,  She sings me her melancholic melody (speaking from the very depths of me)  As my fingers make her cry out for more love.  I lie in the darkness of our room as the love we make  creates sweet sinful sounds, echoing through the still night.  At times, - she is my meaning, she is the reason I seek,  each time we're apart - I ache to hold her, hear her voice.  and each time I feel the world start to eat at my flesh,  I find my sanity in those six strings she wears,  thank you love - for everything you've been to me  thank you for your patience with my inexperience and inadequacies  and thank you for the songs we shared, played tenderly (with love) on your strings   ---   Not one lip.   Crucified on your altar,  I forced myself a smile to brighten your day fingers ache this ledge might break and leave me  crashing- grasping for a rope to hold  myself to solid ground  you stand there an ache personified desire a wish for something to touch and feel something tangible to hold  through whispering nights  i kept my pen in my pocket  keeping the poems that would  spurt forth as vague hopes as faraway as two lifetimes a promise not even there  not even one lip and when my fingers would hold no more we hung up the lines  and sought solace in the forgiving arms of sleep needing dreams that would  pacify this need distract me from this  bittersweet sweet reality (... you bitch...) i need you...  ---   shallow.   i have sunk to the depths of shallowness the thoughts that ache in my mind a confused mixture of childish ideals and pretentions the many visions of a shallow utopia and nirvana the whispers of a perfect complete state of mind like a childish song playing over and over in my head in my small minded quest to open my mind, i cheat myself of the very maturity i seek  just because my feet do not touch the ground,  does not mean that the waters i swim in are deep indeed i am only floating in shallow waters deluding myself in the thought that i have swum far into deep oceans   ---   Never... unless you're sure .  Her handwriting's changed her point of view as well she's lost that shy innocence, she's more coy than ever her hairstyle's changed too she does it up the way he likes it when she smiles at me, its not the same smile i never knew a year could be so long... her letters- now yellow,  mine... she's burnt them i think ... he's nothing like me... NOTHING like me... certainty has turned to doubt to self loathe, regret and now stupid scribbled poetry i never knew a year could be so long"   a couple of things..  monologue posponed till monday.  photo shoot posponed till....(good question)  growing apart sucks ass big time.  it's amazing how people write from their souls sometimes. so fucking beautiful..and soul searching. gut wrenchingly perfect, and so incredibly mesmerizing, euphoric, deppressing, sarcastic..seven hundred emotions that flow through at once. seven hundred different senses evoked at the same time.   kinda like someone peeled back layers so delicately carefully kept, a deep dark secret hidden it is somber, painfully quiet and hushed in here. so fucking fragile. so fucking careful...like treading on broken wine glasses, bleeding.    "our friendship  no matter how loosely tied, how strained, how intangible, how fucking strong and time-tested, how down right oddly related, i treasure the fact that we are friends who inspire each other everyday."   get that straight bitch.   sorry, i love you, i've moved on, and i'm letting go, i'm trying, and i'm happy, and i'm sad and i'm alone and i'm alive and i'm so so many things but i can't find the words and can't find the right exact perfect pieces to thread them together to form sentences that will make sense. that will strike deep.   would you like this new look?  jet black hair, heavy on the eyeliner, striped nails alternating between red and black with white flowers(maybe daisies) and sparkles in the middle, silver jewelry...oversized hoops, leather cord, odd pendant that alternates between beaded chokers and randomly tied strings. long (fake) eyelashes brushed with mascara, body jewelry adorned. make up just right..almost. rosy cheeks, dark burgundy lips and gold shimmer on the eyelids. tanned, minus the lines from a tennis game in a sports bra, bitchy but most importantly, confident. almost scaringly cocky.   playing dress up by the mirror. twirling in odd ends and pieces from the bottom of the closet to the drawers shoved in between. a silk dress pulled up to be made into sexy lingerie, add a belt and it's glam. a twist of material here and add of a look there and something else is created. so many ideas, bursting out with creativity, liking what's reflecting back...having a good time. twenty 'european roses' sit in an overcrowded vase in a far little square in a distance yet noticable. the reds, the yellows, the off-whites. 'overcrowded.' she smiles.   gigglies are so damn embarassing, and odd.   funky shoes left in her locker at school with that little black number and another yellow tulip. she tries and pieces her schedule for saturday together and her song comes on air. she hums, sings, then oddly feels a tear slide down her cheek. good tears? bad tears? she doesn't care anymore, why make a big deal out of something that is so beautiful? why make a big deal out of feeling? why be afraid of feeling?  a bowl of blood, a syringe of medication, a chapter in a book, a series of events. a realization. a confirmation.   too many random thoughts to organize. too many questions to find answers...things she will never know. things she must learn in time.   she finds out for herself.   she finds herself.

       "She looks at me with those...  huge, vulnerable eyes,  and all I'm thinking is :  God - ... I can't reach her,  Outside looking in and ...  I must say -  I think I'm in love,  The colourful Sundays and  the sad Tuesdays,  I want to have all that with her,  Sucking popsicles on a swing,  watching grass grow,  ...God - I can't reach her,  I am her lapdog,  one look - one glance and I sink  to the highest high.  or float to the deepest depths  She doesn't see me,  the window only lets you look in,  but the sign on the door says "closed",  and - God -I can't reach her.  I can't reach her."     it's funny how people hold on to things...i pulled a 'taylor' thing and switched monologues because smart-ass keith has my notes in the trunk of his car from beach, tennis and cast meet the other night but anyway, it's this rather ironic, flipped out, bite-in-the-ass piece by cheryl west and i was working on it last night and this morning and it's significance just hit me. it's weird how monologues are itsy-bitsy threads of who you are inside and it takes certain things in you to pull it off.  in any case, here's to hoping i do good anyway.   speaking in which, the theater auditions are up again next week for the fall and spring term of 2003. i hell yeah better get well soon because i need to pull off a serious monologue and a song. not quite sure what i'm doing yet, just throwing a couple of things in random air.   we'll see.   :P  hm. i talked to hung over curly sue earlier today too while switching locker things and getting my dress and shoes back. it's scary how alcohol is almost a staple of collegiate life. to a certain extent, pathetic too...but seeing as i'm equally in the same boat and escaping reality or extending altered perceptions are nice once in a while...it's all good i suppose.  hey, in all defense, you only live once eh?  i've been having glimpses of amnesia. i start to say something but i forget halfway, or i mean to do something then it slips my mind. i must be going old, or i'm on so many things my limited brain cells can only muster enough of strength to get my ass up.   hm...the hormones or raging. the crazy bitch hides beneath the surface and the happy girl comes out to play. the childish one, not the brat, just the playful silly girl. and it's cute a while...you bask in her glory, you dance in the melody her voice carries...and she lets you in a while. invites you to play with her.   things are drastically changing, drastically improving in her life, so many new things on her plate to sort through, so many exciting things to look forward to. love is universal where ever you are, where ever you may be. and to others, she's seen heaven in their innocence before, the cherubic faces she cannot wait to get back to...yet death waits patiently close by, constantly reminding things aren't forever but hope shields her. so long as there's hope, she's safe...no matter which world she is in. no matter what state. no matter who she becomes.   she's emerging, and sheddding. and she has many to thank, the old man says begin with him, barker says what about me, puck says me too, me too, but then again, she chooses them all, but stops to look within herself. selfishly, she twirls around alone for a while, then thanks herself.   she did good this time. she gave in to continuity.   she gave in to her voices.  she'll make it.  her brother laughs, mocks her and says, "oh here we go again,"  she never liked playing by the rules anyway.   :P

      so, a little of today;  the procedure went, predictably, quite smoothly and it's nice to be able to breathe again. as terrifying as it seems, you do so much of this shit so many times it becomes uneventful after a while...minus of course the new faces, and strange buildings?   unfortunately though, i have this horrid ulcer (canker sore, depending on where you're from) that's underlining my accent and making it worst because i'm taking extra care in trying to not irritate it. it's pathetic i tell ya...:P   but yeah, i also have a monologue to present tomorrow and another shot on monday, depending on, in which both the old man is going to help me with.   i. because he's good at that shit.   ii. well, because he's nice like that. and hey, i know i lot of people would willingly watch somebody jab me with a couple of needles but really, who else would voluntarily listen to me whine/bitch/complain through it eh?  oh well.   in other news, guess who went grocery shopping with me today.   and even better, guess who drove? :P  all the way through town, around town, and back!   woohoo. ten thousand gazillion points for the girl.   heh, so the chinese guy formerly known as friend-of-a-friend-of-a-friend's-competitor is now reintroduced back into the picture. why? i don't know really, just cause i guess. forgiveness is a good thing i suppose. besides, barker might have helped with that and so did the dj thing on friday night. in any case, with all the shit that went down on friday night, it's best to be friend's with him a while..just in case you know?  so we went through the list of food we needed to get on the diet and trying to somewhat eliminate the dairy products and the weird looking, evil tasting stuff, running from one end to the other because i brilliantly didn't bring a pen on me nor really separate the sheets. oops.   but yeah, i had fun. other than looking like a bum with shorts and a top...but then again, it's wal*mart so big fucking deal. :P  we bought bones for yen-yen, strange yellow tulips for barker and blue-shirt, surprise for old man (you'll find out tomorrow if i manage to stalk you down) and of surprise, surprise, healthy food for the bullimic.   excuse me while i keel over and die laughing. or puking.   :P   puck and madonna are off to wendy's and are rubbing it in my face. evil bitches.   nevermind that they got tans at the beach today with fancypants and singingboy too.   pah.   so, it's been a pretty good day i suppose. kinda nice, kinda subdued, kinda relieving really.  oh.   besides, i got to talk to a certain boy in yorkshire today too.   (i told you you'd miss me bitch. :P )  but yeah, i thought i'd insert a nice update instead of the feel sorry for myself whirly one from last night. hm. yeah. last night.  oh nevermind...   it ended up good though. good cries are always nice, especially when someone holds you through it. all that needing to be alone bullshit? just drama, random overthinkingness, and crankiness while being sick and feeling sorry for one's self.   :)  oh, and in other news..   "crazy shit man. at least i have to work tonight. that will keep me out of at least some trouble. i live an amazing life. who knows if i'll call this girl back. i mean i should, she was fucking hot. but i dunno. i don't really care. it's kinda like fishing. the fun is in reeling them in. since i'm not motivated by a desire to fuck every girl i see, i'd be totally fine not seeing her ever again. so do i keep her, or throw her back? eh, not something i'm overly concerned with. in keeping with my aquatic analogy, there are plenty of fish in the sea. ."   lol, otherwise known as the thrill of the hunt. stability is all nice and dandy but there's nothing like looking hot, knowing it, and basking in it i suppose. yum-yum to that.   wait till you get to the part of bitch fighting. the shit gets better i tell you. :P  ...and here she goes on another tangent again. i forgot my point, but then again, i always do. oops.   but yeah, just to say it went okay today and i'm alive and all that good shit. ooh...and this too...     :)  ((hugs))

      he wanted me to come on tonight, to talk he said. he missed me.   and so i did.   i dragged my fat yellow overweight sick ass out of bed at exactly a quarter to twelve and started putzing around.   blatantly making it obvious to be 'okay', to protect, to make sure he didn't know that i wasn't feeling too good. i'm sure he heard though, he always does. even before i posted, he's got his angels (spies), he's got his information (sneak attacks) and sometimes i wonder why we even bother at all.   i read an email he wrote me about a month ago. the last trauma, the last hooha. the last email i was convinced would end everything...and then it reminded me again of the other site, and how the ending of one hate mail would lead to two others. and then i wondered, why even bother at all?  i had the chills last night. chills because of my temperature or chills because of the nightmare i had, i'm not quite sure. but someone tried to kill me, and i was duped. it was a nice man and that nice man was secretly evil and it was so goddamn cliqued i mocked it in my head but i was so afraid too. my heart pounded so fast, so fast, and my sweat beaded profusely. fear is a great fucked up feeling i tell you.   i'm guessing, three to one, that it was because i fell asleep to 'one hour something', that movie by robin williams and my overdrugged cranky self.   oh well. i thought i'd write it down anyway.  i'm feeling a little sorry for myself right now. i hate hospitals, but more than that, i hate it that i'm doing this alone again. by choice.   or maybe not.  i don't know really.  i should probably go to bed and get some rest.  i should probably sleep and escape into fairy tales of love and tranquility.  i should probably do so many things i will probably never achieve.   i should probably believe in myself.  i can't though, not tonight, tonight, i'd just like to return back to comfort a while.  tonight i'd like to fall back to something familiar.  tonight, i'd like to dissappear into my own world a while.   or so i say.  it's funny how people come out with theories to justify things.  to erase the gnawing guilt that drives at you.   i miss you too you dumb stupid assholic whore bastard loser fucker bitch retard inconsiderate fuckass.  and just because you need me tonight, doesn't mean that i need you too.  because i never need anyone remember?  because i sail that fucking ship alone.  because i'm good alone.  because. because. because.  i   am  alone.

      ever notice that? that you have some of the most amazing conversations just because one or the other, or if you're lucky, both, are on their tippy toes and trying to impress?  hmm.  well anyway, old man took me out for egg drop soup. not chicken soup mind you, because a. racheal isn't exactly conventional, and b. fuck the chicken. so while i lay in bed trying to burn zank and join onyx in kitty hell, sniffling, head pounding, coughing, moaning and whining, puck and the old man work on a 'very special surprise' (not at liberty to divulge information) while ruminating little boy bush's speech in missouri.   it's funny how many thoughts and comments can swirl through your head but not much follows through.   so if you're wondering, yes, i've been sick as a dog (i almost misspelled it god there) the last couple days and no, it hasn't been fun at all. and just for the record, because i am asian and have a flu, it doesn't mean i have sars thank you very much. now try telling that to my doctor.  grr.  i have to go in so they can put a tube down my chest tomorrow and do 'oxygen' treatment.  i'm trying to whing my way out of it with orange juice and pills but it isn't exactly working.   isn't it nice to see that i still have a sense of humor though?  ooh, i had a scene due today. or rather a monologue by ken friedman but i've been so shitty the last few days that when i stopped by stan's office to make up excuses to not present it today....he gave me a big great hug. :) isn't that nice? hehe, that put a grin on my face other than it somewhat freaked me out that people were talking about me in class and had told him i wasn't feeling too good?   but yeah, back to what i started off earlier.  alltel and i had a nice pleasant long assed conversation this afternoon...he stopped by after work to  'see how i was doing'  because  'he was in the neighborhood'  and  'that's what friends are for' . and just at the right time too because i was in so much pain and discomfort and starting to feel all bad and nostalgic and cranky that he made things better because the boy is pretty good i tell ya.   i skipped the head doctor today too, which was probably a bad idea because dealing with everything that has been happening, is happening, and about to happen, i probably shouldn't skip any sessions but oh well, big fucking deal.   i talked to a certain someone the other night about barker. perhaps it didn't really sink in till today about how i feel about shit nor what i am really doing till today. something about all the things that were said in that conversation came back to haunt me and question everything i stood for. perhaps it was the way things were yesterday, and those goddamn noisy kids and pool work at eight bloody o'clock in the morning. or maybe...i don't know.   how does working with someone correlate into what we are doing? how do we keep proffessional and play apart? how do you separate director and friend? you just fucking do that's all.   there are levels and things that need to be done for the sake of my sanity and his, there are secrets, there are pretend to be's and there are backroom shit. i am not going to sit here and take crap from anyone for anything because i feel the need to do things that make me happy or things that i like so fuck you turds, but thank you for your opinions. you have yours, and thankfully, i have mine too.   do i know how things are going to turn out? hell fucking no. do i understand everything that's involved and how things are going to work out? of course not. do i confidently know that i have all my shit together? you stupid?   do i still have open-ended unanswered questions? hell bloody yeah.   does that mean i just give up and say oh well screw this and continue my existence pathetically knowing that i'm a wimp and a baseless gut? i'd rather prefer not to.   god, i don't even know how this started, or how i went into my hour long debate with alltel because it suddenly dawned on me all the questions that had plagued barker, and i figure if anything, i would get constructive bullshit from alltel , so i sat there sniffling at the roses he had brought over (but i couldn't smell), coughing, lying around in my sweats and watching some ass weird 80's movie looking very darn attractive i'm sure, and we went over baseless thoughts and backed up voices. or rather it was me ranting, screaming, crying, shouting, laughing, yelling, talking, as he pieced together words quietly, calmly, and confidently. these men i tell ya, so damn irritating.   :P  hm. i know i dragged my lazy butt off the bed to write soemthing good here, how i felt and what it's been like the last couple of days. but then as usual, i went off to a tangent..and now i don't really know what i was trying to say or what i started off to write about except maybe, you know, i don't know what's going on in my life, i don't have it all pinned down, and i don't have it all neatly arranged in categories. but hey, i'm okay, and things are pretty good for the most part.   i am still (barely) alive even after that little emergency scare, school's still going well despite missing some classes (friends are great aren't they?) and though certain issues aren't resolved...i honestly think they never will be. i just have to remember it isn't the end of the world when my heart hurts and the tears weep. yet, even with everything, i hope some day he'll know it was real and that love, no matter how tainted it ended up being, was real.   and now that i'm sappy and indecisive (fucking libra) i'm going back to bed.   goodnight all.   (thanks for the mail)

      cast meeting + auditions tonight.  hm.    "Why do all superheroes wear spandex? If a missing person sees their picture on a milk carton that offers a reward, would they get the money?  Is sign language the same in languages other than English?  Why do you have to "put your two cents in" but it's only a "penny for your thoughts"? Where's that extra penny going to?   How is it that we put man on the moon before we figured out it would be a good idea to put wheels on luggage?  What would happen if: Everyone was to flush their toilet at the same time?  If the weather man says "it's a 50% chance of rain" does that mean he has no idea if its going to rain or not?  Is there anything easier done than said?  What do you say when someone says you're in denial, but you're not?  If you own a piece of land and there is an volcano on it and it ruins a nearby town, do you have to pay for the property damage?  If Pringles are "so good that once you pop, you can't stop" why do they come with a resealable lid?"   ...stolen from  urlLink joy .

       "a random thought about the search for the right.  today, sitting in the desert i had time to think about why we are here. after seeing the war at first hand : both sides of a struggle for freedom and pwoer, i know now. the desert has a way to isolate you in a crowd. it's desolating heat, it's barren sands can make you feel like no one would ever want anything but leave it's wrath yet people are here, and they want to be here. it is home to them. that is when it hit me...a memory hit me like bullets to the heart. it was so powerful i began to see it all very vividly through my mind's eye.  i was remembering a convoy that i was on. it was a resupply run in a safe zone, there was no fighting there, just a lot of scared people from both sides. whole families with nothing left but what they could carry on them. soldiers and marines from the allies huddleing wherever they could to get out of the blistering sun. it looked like something from the bible, bodies were sprawled out in the shade to keep cool and empty water bottles were all over the dusty desert. exhaustation had set in and all of a sudden, everyone of the soldiers and marines got in their vehicles and took off like lightning had struck.   it was time to go to another fight.   all i can say is wow! it was amazing to see the dedication to the cause. those people later lost some people to the war. they were tortured and murdered...that is all i will say about that.   what i remember though is this, these men and women shared their precious shhade, their water and food with the native people who had congugated around them, this was not for show. it was the right things to do, even more impressing on me was the fact those allied military fighters didn't have any extra food and water, and they didn't think twice about sharing what they had. that was the right thing to do and that is all that matters.  we are here to do the right thing, no matter what anyone nation or world organization thinks we are here for. politics mean nothing to those with no freeson. the oppression these people endure are of the most disgusting in the history of the world, bar none. the search for the right ends with a rebirth of nation: it will be a sweet nectar of freedom and liberty. the search for peace has come at a high cost, and that cost comes in blood. but it has always come in such ways. tirany will fall here, and for good.  crying eyes are dried by the dusty desert reminding us there is no time for tears for those we have lost, there is still a job to do. and we will complete our task to give this country back to it's people. during this war, the blood and sweat has poured out of our bodies to flood this land with freedom, it washes our souls of doubt to see it first hand.   war has one enemy; our memories are all too short. we have to remember why we are here and what we do here. it is not a pat on the back, it is a lesson in history. then and only then can we take the time to grieve, when the lesson i over. it is time for out country to grieve for us not, we will remember our fallen comrades now and forever which is a duty we bear and cherish readily when the time comes for us to do so. but for now, we live to fight for all the people of the world to know the freedom they deserve as human beings.   when the tears stop falling, when we are back home and peace has come, we must all the world realize our responsibilities to one another. no matter what the causes, the effect of this war, the casualties of it do not care. they are dead, do not forget them or the lessons learned from this conflict. make the world a better place with the blood shed on this battle ground. consecrate in your mind to always try and do the right thing. it is the duty we have as human beings to not only appear as good but be good. every minute of the day we must ask ourselves, what can i do to help me fellow man.  sometimes it will be hard and we will make mistakes, just find to find the right and never forget why. we, the people who protect our freedom will always know the price of freedom. that is why our mottot is so important to us in my line of work, it is the rescueman's slogan, "these things that we do that others may live,"  to add to it makes no sense so i won't.  -SSgt Kirk L. Bobleter USAF"   i'm sorry i didn't understand earlier. but today, i stood beneath the yellow ribbons we put up for you and said a prayer. the whole neighborhood is flooded with ribbons, from the front mount of our addition to the back end and the dock. uncle bruce prays that mark comes home safely too, and we watch cnn daily, perhaps hoping to catch a glimpse of you.   i watch, sometimes hear her cry at night, she misses you. you're her youngest, her precious one. the naughty cheeky ass with a sharp tongue and it was silly, but the other i thought it would be supercool to just have you come home. but then i realized you would never ever do that, you're great at what you do. and i think it is safe to say, i am fucking proud to know you. you've watched me grow, turn into the little bitch i am, and i am amazed.  i respect you because you've changed from playful idiot to matured soul. wow.   take care you and don't kill me when you read this.   p/s i figured you might like the extra attention anyway.  go save some lives and come back home safe okay?

       barker says:   "When a guy likes a girl and a girl likes a guy but knows that the guy likes her, the girl no longer wants the guy until the guy no longer wants the girl, THENNN the girl once again wants the guy."  "Skin color based racism..that's so absurd it's almost quaint!"    "The funny thing about the word "LOVE" is that there is such a large range of emotion involved in it that there is only one word to describe it."   R-S

      girls are so damn   odd  strange   vicious   indecisive   needy   beautiful  insecure  loving  selfless  bitchy  selfish  honest  amusing  gentle  amazing.  perhaps that is why i am attracted to them...because they are sensitive and everything at once. because they aren't afraid to show you when they are hurting...because they come to you when they're hurting. no matter how hard, how thick, how goddamn strong the wall, girls break. get broken. cry. seek comfort.   girls get honest and strip layers and make love to you in the simple more passionate trusting amazing way.   giving.   the way the hip bones are just right, bony but not malnourished, but then again, i am the bullimic and thiness is beauty and strength. the way their lips swell up and breasts beg to be touched, be taunted, be teased.   for some odd reason, i am attracted and aroused by this. by some very odd things i've discovered in the last hour. perhaps it's the softness in the way she writes, and i can imagine her lips, and the words that form on her mouth. her voice echoing, her body naked next to mine. i think this must be highly illegal somehow, because the tension is great. because the tension has been there for more than a year now, and to have her say it out loud is almost dangerous. like playing with fire.   out in the open.   because i've just realized that i desire, lust, want to fuck her probably as bad as she does. herself and me included, self-pleasure. give in to the glories of getting wet, yet i will miss the entrance. but then again, that's what dildoes are for i suppose.   if you can't tell, i'm horny as a jackrabbit at the peak of the season. it must be the hormones i say, it damn well fucking must be. because right now, i feel like a nymphomaniac. which is almost odd and ironic considering the week i've had, of absolute amazing crazy highs and down right shitty depressing lows.   i have a fuck buddy.  i try and ruminate this and put it into my categories and i think i actually might have.   and you know, that's sort of fucking cool.  there was a 6963 guy this morning, and i put out my ciggarette by the entrance way and talked to this small slightly older man (60's?) that just wanted to chat and probably just needed to a friend, i reached in and did one of those crazy moment things and gave him a hug. he looked like he was going to cry, like he hadn't had a hug in a while..and my heart just nearly about broke. little things i take so much for granted, i have love, i have laughter, i have tears, i have life.   and i told him to take care, stay safe. and i felt good, inside, i felt amazing. like my sorry ass had did something good, and all i really did was listened, shared a ciggarette and gave him a hug. but it felt good, and i felt good, and i know it sounds retarded, but it was sorta magical.  but hey if anything, i also learned about alka-seltzer and curing hangovers?   i imagined someone doing that for my grampa, and that slid a tear down my cheeks. i tried to brush it away, before it became this full blown incontrollable nostalgic racheal thing and so i rang him. and it made him so happy. i rang to say i love you, i rang to say hie grampa, i miss you.   and that was kinda cool.  then i went for classes. and sat a while as the lecturers brought me on a journey of myths and dreams, and hopes and needs, and wants and desires. and i thought to myself, life is pretty damn something right now, life is pretty damn beautiful.   i went for my last class, and handled drama in between. yelling girls on the phone, each screaming to tell me about boy a and boy b and boy abcdefg from last night. each getting their own spotlight, and fifteen minutes...but the boys wanted a share too. and so another fifteen minutes gone by, of strange inconcievable rambling and bullshit, somewhat comedic value but then i realized i enjoyed this. that i was someoen to come to, that i was important enough to someone for them to want to tell me about their day...and i thought to myself:  pretty damn cool.   and it was a cool day too. it was fucking gorgeous, it was cold but not too cold, sunny but not blazingly hot. i looked good and the strange thing was, i knew it too. i had earrings just right, a platinum flat necklace with the twisted 'artistic' pendant, heels, a very fucking great bra (thank you victoria and silicone), a halter top just right and pinstripe pants. and not to mention the shades old man and i bought the other day...i had numbers flung at me, hello's and how are you doing. and now i'm going to go against what all the lying bitches tell you and say, hell yeah i liked the attention.   only that here comes the ironic part.  i gimped out on a date and somehow ended up back at barker's place. refusing to place my ass in anymore shit that i've already flung at myself. it was nice to just lay there a while, a breathing, beating, pulsing body next to me, on top of me, behind me, under me. it was nice to feel wanted, desired, loved, needed, craved, lusted after.  not just an object, not just a thing, not just a girl with tits and a hole, but an actual person.   and it felt good...like things fell into place a while. as if all the thoughts that swirled constantly in my mind got trangressed and translated into little tiny cubicles and lighted pathways.   :)  and so i smiled.  did some homework.  rode back home with the old man and powerpuff girl who tells me she's waiting for her angel, her wings to fly. it's amazing how much innocence a five year old can have, it's amazing how old her soul is.   puck is yelling on the phone to get off my butt and go party.  there goes my great friday night plans of vegging out in front of the tv in underwear and magaritas.   :P  i'm sure i'll update later...there always are stories when puck and madonna are involved.   have a great friday night!

       "yeah, you capture my sentiments exactly. We all seem to be pretty much screwed and for the same reasons, work, work, work, work. Doesn't matter where you are, it's the same thing. God, this place is crazy, it's living hell. There's so many things going on at the same time that sometimes I just feel like crying, in fact I have cried, I've never been this stressed before in my entire life. I have the most wonderful relationship of my life and I have hardly enough time with him. This college makes you look so old. What was it again in the brochure.."a highly challenging course designed for motivated students"....HAH...HAHA...HAHAHAHHAHAAHAAHAA everything suddenly seems so funny. You'd think in a college with only 200 students, chosen from all over the world for their excellent outstanding character and abilities, you would have no thefts, no people punching holes in the wall, no stupid little petty things like that. And then everyone will sit in the dayroom and complain about it, but it still goes on, and all these little things, you can't get away because you're always stuck on campus, your life becomes the campus, you get sick of the same people, seeing the same faces, hearing the same whispers about who and who is sleeping with who and who, because everyone knows everything about everyone on this campus, including the faculty members including the principal, who fucked who last night and where.  Hypocrisy, hypocisry, the amount of competition, 200 power hungry individuals who never knew defeat for the greater parts of their lives, were always the top in everything back home, crammed together in a tiny sardine tin and marketed as an "international experience,", a "united world." And the war starts and in this place the only thing you hear are anti war statements, nobel laureates come to speak against war, bad bad bad, but never a war supporter. Only pacifists are allowed on campus, brain washing, brainwashing. And there are good things about this place but at the moment I can't remember them...but of course they are, and even if there aren't, how can it be a waste of two years of your life ( i haven't even gone to university yet!) when you met a guy that you know you're gonna marry?   but then again that's what you always think.....  it is the best and the worst time of my life too.   Then of course there's the personal realisations of the inadequacy of yourself and the discrepancy between who you lived with for 19 years and who you are now, and what you are, of dreams burst and of naivete lost, of childish confidence gone replaced by a disillioned reality that is true but breaks you to face it, and you need to start learning how to walk all over again, which is the good part, and the only support you get is from him.   well now since i've done my share of depressive outpourings..time to go do depressing lab reports on the depressing experiment on the quality of hydrogen peroxide in Wal Mart...  Florida ain't that difffernt from New Mexico huh. Love, Rina "   you are beautiful, amazing, intelligent and brilliant rina  ...inspiring.  loved.  (very much)

       "Does he have any idea, I wonder, just how blessed he is to be  allowed so close to one so precious as you? "   i wonder sometimes, but then i heard it in his voice tonight.   it made me cry, but not in a bad way. okay, maybe it did hurt a little. and maybe we are going apart some, realizing and searching our own destinies.   i missed you though. falling asleep in your arms. maybe for a moment, i could pretend i was everything this void in me needed to be filled. and maybe i could be everything your emptiness needed to be completed.  i honestly don't really know. the flight out to la is booked, it's been arranged down for quite a while...except maybe i just didn't get round to cancelling it. except maybe i didn't want to do it, i don't know. you see, it is that same exact feeling i get when you talk about ena and rhonda. it's hard on my part too, i don't know why. i shouldn't be affected really, we're just friends.  you and i. a little more than just fuck buddies, friends with benefits. special.   i don't know.   it's really just a name. a title. a definition. a little box with a catergory.   things have changed. drastically. i remember how naively simple and silly things use to be, then how it goes intense and crazy a while, then maybe a nice type of comfortable and now a weird sort of imbalance. but we take it as the day comes, and another sunrise rolls around, another wave crashes on the beach and another seagull swoops down to knock over an ice-cream cone.   life does go on when you aren't looking. when you aren't paying attention. when you don't expect it to.   i hate this feeling.   happy, sad, in-between and content.   but you know what, everything happens for a reason.  and you are my reason.  i want to believe...but then again, i wonder if we made a mistake too?

      saat-saat begini, ku terlintas kepada malam-malam yang terbiar di dalam ingatan dan bisikan hati yang menyerapi fikiranku.   ku sememang-memang cinta padamu tetapi kian terhempas harapan kehidupan mu di dalam dunia ku. ku teguh, sabar, melintasi perjalanan ini yang mengusut-ngusut, tergores, mencabar.   menghitung kikisan-kikisan yang ku terhempas, jatuh..melukai diriku.   besar kemungkinan ku tidak akan memasuki pintu duniamu lagi, besar lagi harapan yang ku tidak akan membiarkan diriku mencintai anda selain daripada tempat yang jauh. tidak pintas. tidak terus.   menakuti, ku kian tidak tahu dirimu apatah lagi, anda kepada ku lagi. sememangnya, wajah kami and air muka tidak banyak berubah tetapi pemikiran, hati, jawapan kini kian kompleks, dan tidak nyata lagi.  ku rindu malam-malam and harian dibiar bersamamu. ku rindu menembusi persona dirimu, mencabar pemikiranmu. dan walaupun air mata kian melintasi mukaku, ku tetap berdiri tinggi, ku tetap menari tarian bidadariku dengan hanya bisikan yang terlepas..  ku tetap and menyintaimu selama-lamanya.   ku rindu padamu.  ku inginmu tahu.  ku perlu menyimpan.    -yes, the malay is rusty, i know.   bite me.

       "I got home, so tired last night. So tired I wasn't even hungrry.  In the garage, I parked the car, closed the door, and started to get out. Then I realized. The car was full of you. A delicate fragrance that pulled me back inside. I sat in the car with my eyes closed, smelling Racheal. Then I remembered: you left your clothes in the car. Your perfume, barely noticeable, had made itself home in the air, my air.  I took the bag inside, got undressed, and crawled into bed in the darkness. No TV. No computer. No light. The blinds drawn on a cloudy night. Darkness. I took your clothes out and laid them neatly on the pillow beside mine. Closed my eyes. And the sweet, subtle scent that I know to be Racheal Khong filled my head, my bed, my room, my world.  I suppose I'm a bit envious of him. He whose fingers have traced the soft contour of you breasts, the firmness of your nipples yearning for his touch in the night. He whose hands have held you so close in such darkness and found there way to every secret place on your body. Does he have any idea, I wonder, just how blessed he is to be allowed so close to one so precious as you?  I drifted off to sleep a sleep that I rarely know anymore. I didn't dream, that I remember. Not even my Racheal Dream, of you and I lying in bed together, the only sound is your voice, talking. Whispering in the night. I slept for six hours, straight. I never sleep that long anymore. It was "the sleep of angels."  And now, I have awakened. So relaxed. So refreshed for the experience of it. A slightly sad, silly smile on my face at my own childish romanticism.  Thanks, Racheal. Just for being you, and letting me into your world, to the extent that I'm allowed. Despite my constant, clumsy attempts at pseudo-seduction...it is enough. I am truly grateful at being The One in your life, every once-in-a-while.  Thanks.  With Love, e=mc2"   no, thank  you .  it's strange to hold love at a beckon, to have it laid spledidly at my feet. it makes me blush and giggle, scream and laugh.   but still though, i thought i'd say, it's an honor to be held up so high when i know you've seen my god awful thrashy bitchy ugly moments.  thank you for being just you.  ...here's your ten points.

      strange headaches otherwise known as 'the morning after' are uncomfortably assholic, like a wedgie of your favorite pair of sheer knickers stuck riding up your crack...the soft feel of it rubbing against your box and the god-awful feeling of your ass being split into two. the lesser of two evils. the generalization of an extreme.   i have layer-y soft flowing black dress on and it fits just right, though i could stand to lose a couple of pounds more...shed off some excess crap from late night "half" waffles with whipped cream and the bloody huge lunch i've had this afternoon. of quesdillas and mexican rice from los racheros and the whole bunch of us just like old times, perhaps missing just a few. nonetheless, it was good. and i feel good. and hell bloody yeah that feels awesome.  :)  i wish i could take a picture and show you the world from my eyes today. but the laptop cord has breathed it's final intake and so the programs are all in it, it is an amazing day. cold nonetheless, but beautiful. inside, my heart smiles and dances to wonderful songs played around me. i join in and partake in it as it's conjoining rhythms draw in more people. a happy crowd of angels surround me, a wonderful circle of friends.   alltel rings during lunch and wants to know what i'm up to tonight...oh, nothing much i say. and smile at the nervous polished voice he resonates. i could play this game but i won't. i'll take the backseat on being a slut this week. i take a backseat on jumping head first into obscure strange trite relationships. relationships? hah.  it's funny how i seem a whole shit load more attractive when i'm not dating.  it's ironic how the numbers come pouring in when you're tired of that game.  it's stupid how the timing is never right...but hey, perhaps the epitome of life is getting things to corrolate just exactly in time.   hitting your sharps and flats at the right beat, in the right frame, at exactly the right bar without a metronome. knowing exactly what comes next and how it goes.   here we go again, up this rollercoaster ride.  it's not that bad, really, it's not that bad.   i could stand to like myself a while.   i could get used to being happy.  :)

      nynkempoop professed undying love to me today.  over a lesbian dominoe club gathering at starbucks.   then we had dinner, and i got romanced to a grand she-bang(in more ways than one) and while pushing around the leafy greens of my salad, ruminated over what was to be called the situation of barker, alltel, shitforbrains, sera with an 'e', and . . .   i came to a nice long empty blank.   which i suppose to many, might be the beauty of it all. of hanging your hearts and sticking it with clothes pins while memories are being crocheted onto it. run, dazzle, frazzle and dance with the flow i suppose, though my opinions vary in awfully trite conflicting terms when it boils down to a decision. decision? what fucking decision?  i've had a caffeine overdose in the last few hours, starbucks will do that to you. starbucks and sobering up always does apparently.  my lazy ass needs to get deported.   i worked on my monologue with nynkempoop and it was beautiful. creative energy spent together is always good what more a very intellectually artistic mind. i'm making straight a's in a couple of classes which is funny considering the shit sense of studying i can attribute to it. i spend so much damn time in those four walls it isn't even funny anymore. an amazement nonetheless, but definitely way too stuck up the ass to be a laughing matter anymore.  the girl gets serious. now isn't that scary?  so while we shared a cigarette and slammed poetry off one another it became fucking apparent that my tits were getting cold in the wind. not very funny at all thank you very much. and seeing as the old man had an encounter with racheal and evil purple pants today, i figured, oh how fucking great. inebriated is a very smart way of dealing with things, what more, drastically simple. and so, we laughed it off. our rumbles, snorts and giggles carried away into the wind that smelled of freshly cut grass and rain.  isn't the smell of rain just absolutely orgasmicfyingly fantastic?  hm.  it's getting cold again, the war coverage seems to be dying down, i've lost an hour and the azaleas are at the end of their bloom. my mom flew to london today, my dad's awful lonely, and my brother has a broken heart. barker's at work again, and puck's been on the phone for an hour with me. the old man went shopping with me today and madonna's kidnapped my cigarettes. noisy asian bitch(i lost by two votes) is dating someone new and boyfriend-of-the-week-who's-forever is somewhat making new major happy, infatuated.   the battery on my cell is dying and so it emits these god-awful annoying beeps and shrieks every couple of seconds which isn't helping the headache any. i'm hyper and tired as hell so i'm rambling at the flight of an express train and the swirling chopping rotators of a lifeflight helicopter. my eyes are peeled on a special documentary about starving kids in africa which is pretty darn ironic if you ask me.   the stuffed snake that's been fucked on countless of times sits lifelessly in the corner of my bedroom it's bright orange and black hues contrasting and it's slithering bright red tongue mocking me...and to think we were going to give it away to the children.  unfinished sketches and binges of crayon/oil-paint bullshit lies scattered throughout the bedroom, some hiding at the bottom of my closet and the other pair of trainers i've been searching for and another covering a pair of lacy knickers from miss victoria, a gift from yamato. what fucking redundant bullshit i write as this hour, as i survey and delete the last couple of whiny, depressive, silly posts....how immensely great it is to feel this power in your hands. the fantastic control of a click, gone forever. history erased. new pleasures discovered.   lavender lotion, that makes me think of his lotion and it's purposes. a long warm bubble bath complete with candles, a book, and funky weird jazz music from the ex's cd that makes me think of fresno. and him showering. and the talk of cold water and it's effects one night. weird, strange moments of different relationships, the good things, and the happy laughy memories that continue to shuffle in my mind like tim missing all his connecting flights, and the taxi cab window reflection on my case and fucking pachebel at three in the morning over naan and fucking tandoori chicken.  terence throwing me onto his shoulders and spinning me around and around and around till we all fall down and tumble down wet grass holding on as bloody tight as we can, sera's infinite gift of beauty and how warmth, sunshine and  niceness flows from her and being made love to with waves crashing just outside the window. nigel and watching the stars at that funny park just outside of the towers with the harsh city lights behind us and the stars dancing around the moon..the fountain splashing, lighted next to us. jared and starbursts and waiting up at the wee odd hours of the morning stuck in a hotel room trying to keep drew away and wanting so damn bad to jump on him.    jae and her god damn sexy body dancing in the middle of a closed restaurant with only the two of us as she sings to me and tickles me to the ground. look up eyes that light up and you'll see hers there. steve and his silly goddamn ass in the studio looking out through panels of glass, screaming on the microphone and purposely messing up voiceovers, failing miserably at keeping sexual tension at bay. chris, mr tough guy, saying seven hundred and fifty two things at once with tears running down his cheeks in the middle of fucking starbucks and that damn stupid cat that appeared out of nowehere and made all things right. screaming i love you in the middle of the mall and the christian dior show together. pietro and positive tones and all that it meant working there and sacrifices, and emotional drama work bullshit to deal with and taking a breather and understanding the thin, very fucking thin line, of friendship and "friendship" and the lengths you would go for your job. franklin and his yamato cooking skills making dinner and pookie jumping around us on the loveseat watching that movie about notes on skin and forgetting things and falling asleep to his heartbeats and him stroking the nape of my back.     ryan and that goddamn cute silly mood he gets when he's happy and that bloody piercing of his. the way he's concern with what you want and how you want it and the moans and whimpers, growls and touching bare skin on bare skin caressing. the way he's strangely naive and so fucking old at the same time, the ways his eyes are of a little bity boy and an old wise man talking, dreaming, hallucinating, and fighting. whispers through the night and singing as you go to sleep, excited. so very different from the other, coming from two very different worlds, it's funny how very similar things sometimes are.   an odd stage. questioning. of knowing yet having a somewhat grip on things, an odd balance.   i think i'll keep you around for a while, you make me happy. laughy. silly.  do stupid things and have "intelectual" conversation without being too ackward.   we've gone around the block and back, i don't know what the hell love is anymore and frankly, i'm not sure if i care to find out. i have scars and a whole slew of shit to prove, old man gives me every damn disorder there is while you blatantly disagree with the idea of it, we swing from one end to the other, another extreme but from captains blog and mine, i watch how things stabilize and i know where i am, where i'm going and how i'm getting there.   i am who i am. you are who you are. he is who he is. they are who they are. and you know what, not one of our single solitary asses can change that.   so at three twenty in the morning with only two and a half hours left to sleep, an exotically blended orange dying out cigarette on my ashtray and diet bloody ginger ale on my desk with the fucking beeps from the cell i say; welcome to this brand new wednesday bloody morning, may it grab me by my tits and swing me by the balls and may it be a fanfuckingtastic ride.   bring it on you fuckers.   i'm ready.  i'm bored.  i'm confident as a bitch.   i'm crazy as a loony.  i'm letting hell freeze over.   i'm getting my share of a piece of ass.   i'm 'getting my shit together'  i'm doing good.   "now back to you, tom."   ....IT'S QUANTITY NOT QUALITY DAMNIT!

      she's been questioning, yet she hasn't quite told anyone. been noticing differences...perhaps the rose colored glasses are broken now and visions are fixed, sharpened.   they talk about it into the wee hours of the night, exchange opinions, provoke thoughts.   understanding a little better..allowing herself to be a stepping stone.   you never know, the voices whisper...even if she is quite certain...but it's okay, they'll wade it through.   instances; now she can blog about it.

      the head doctor always ends our session with, "how do you think we did today racheal?" and sometimes i say, bloody great..sometimes it's just an okay...and sometimes an i don't know, i'm not sure. days range from ups to downs, manics and depressives, goods and bads, okays and normal...but what is normal really?  i can feel the chocolate-chip cookie i've had after bingeing act up. i know i've thrown up tonight, perhaps that is a worst feeling when you're watching events that are so close to heart replay on television. behind me, my mom packs to leave tomorrow. she's watched the documentary in her room and me mine. i couldn't watch it together; it was too hard. and she wants to know if i have anything to say to her, if i want to talk or anything...and the only thing i can do is say no, is to deny it tonight. i'm alright mom, i'm okay. don't worry.   nobody worry. nobody freak goddamnit i am fine. i am alright. i am okay. i am normal.   everyone has fucking issues with it. barker, old man, puck, madonna, the whole bloody world and i want to scream and scream and scream. cry. leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone.  she suggests the treatment center, psychiatrists, slaying the demons head on and i am worried, afraid. what's the point i sometimes say...what's the point when it always returns anyway. when i know it will come back...when it is a fact.   so many issues tonight, so many questions. and i'm going in tomorrow, one last session with the mom. and i'm afraid of the things we have to talk about, and i'm worried about the shit we have to go through, the wringer i know that i will be made to step in. and i am nervous, anxious. sweaty and fidgetty...what do i do now? what do i do?  i need to cry.  i need to go throw up.  i need to go be normal.   i need to hide.   ...but i'm okay, really.

      so in comes the sexalicious alltel guy again.  once a month, i get my fix of gq goodness, american charm and bankruptcy applications while bringing my fat yellow ass down to the store to get the half a thousand down. only that today, we come to this big fucking discovery that allbloodytel has been mischarging my account for the last three months.   ironic? coincidental? serves my ass right?...i don't know. i've never been one to scrutinize payment to payment and so i just assumed i was paying for my overcharged minutes and long distance roaming, not really paying attention at all to the vast differences in accounts nor the huge surge. stupid me, i know.   but hey, for consolation, i got a 300-400 dollar rebate, a new fucking amazing plan, person eating out of my palm plus a confidence/happy booster.   puck, you would have been proud of my damsel in distress foreign bitch i had going on. excuse me? but please talk english, no minutes, mobile, long-distance, wireless, international, nights and weekends, morning, all time, bullshit jargo talk thank you very much.   heh.  sexual tension is a great feeling.

       having  losing a whole extra hour to ruminate and let thoughts and opinions swirl in my gray mass is evil. pure unadulerated evil.  so we're..i don't know what we are really. and perhaps, that is the beauty of it. that it is undefined, uncategorized. not quite a relationship yet a little bit more than friends; dating, yet not exactly going out together...but somewhat exclusive too.   it's nice in an odd way...but it leaves the loose ended strings untied. easily returnable to the past, creates space...second thoughts. thirds and fourths.  nostalgia is a bitch.

      he rolls over, sun-washed and bathed in morning rays, sunlight piercing through the blinds, birds chirping and radio going off in a tangent...blowing. awakened by my half-asleep fidgetting and ciggarette smoke from comfortable stupor. fingers trail bodies and lips meet each other; saving, reaching, consoling, finding.   unconscious mouthing of words, lyrics as the fall asleep spooned in together, talking. questioning, theories bashed around and sides taken, stances. he talks about her diseases, she talks about his idiocyncracies and they figure out together. of finding a position that's comfortable, of sacrifices and indulgence.   he's made the bed. he's brought orange soda and inserted the stereo. she lights the candles and strips him down.   "fuck me," she says.   and the old man's advice rings in her ears. what if? could it be? what do you think?  and the voice of her mother that nags about accidents and her father that wants to know if he's tested and the ex that just shrugs it off. they had a pleasant conversation the afternoon before, gallantly referring himself to the 'best' ex he claimed as he told her he missed her much and wished to work things out. she could only laugh, smile smugly and brush it off.   time to move on, honey.  and so they fall asleep to odd strange dreams and wake up to tranquility. hyperness. discord. harmony.   she's learning as they go...she's standing as she moves...she's reaching higher.   somewhere out there a soldier fights for his life, and the people of his nation...but here she lays in peace with hushed worries and new found dreams for tomorrow.   she believes.

(is that good or bad?)  the papers are folded, the grade is on the back sheet. my fingers shake and i think about how i'm going to go home a hopeless reject and how i'm god's worst creation on earth and step out of class to finally read my dictation.   97 and a well done.   say what?   97 and a well done.    ---  she aces both papers.  she gleams.  she did good.

"look at the seagulls"   "look at the sun, and the gentle way it hides behind the clouds..flirting to come out and play...shying away"  "look at the way the different hues paint the skies, a little bit of blue here, some orange there, off-white in a distance and kaledoscopic in the middle."  of cream cheese with chives on toasted onion bagels..orange soda and root beer from bottles and glasses. sitting on the kitchen counter top ticking off days and marking off events, riding in the car ruminating thoughts and problems and solutions. listening, hearing, talking through touches without sounds...comforting.  barker's beautiful mind goes into overdrive, i've never told you this but you amaze me.  the careful way you schedule things without being too assholic. it's nice to have stability, it's nice to have someone know what's going on. you don't overdo it in a charts and nonsensical garbage way...but gently. thoughtfully. intellectually.  the everpresent easily attainable smile i know is always there. where when everything crashes and fall you manage to detach shit and make things simple...like they should be.  "being happy and being a good person" your motto.  you question about people's goals and dreams in life. you wonder and you ask...trying to save the world. you've saved someone silly, you've saved me.  and to put it in "yorkshire's terms"...let go of the twig and run with the currents.   we'll see how this goes...maybe it will, maybe it won't.  but hey, we tried.   and hey, sometimes it's nicer to just go with the flow..

THE TRUTH. (Love is hard work. And, sometimes, hard work can really hurt.) Love is a game. If they didn't tell you before, we will tell you now. Love is a game and if you play you either win, lose, or get ejected before the game is over. There are no ties. Maybe you'll lose and learn some great, meaningful answer from it all (like if it looks to good to be true, it is). It's easy to love something when you don't have to work at it. It's harder when it asks something of you. You just might be afraid to give. Give it anyway. The heart is the most resilient muscle. It is also the stupidest. So if this love you've found is good to you, hold it, keep it, shout about it. If it isn't, then maybe you should just become very good friends.  "    i think about how some day the memory of him won't hurt quite as much as it does now...that some day, we'll get together and have conversations like we used to. only that we are mean now...we test friendship once a while, give it a go, before everything comes crashing down again and we remember all the reasons why we grew apart. why things ended the way they did.   reading what you said brought it all back, i suck in the tears that stream on my cheeks against my will, but against the oddly coincidental song i've cried to a lot of nights that has mysteriously come on air...i am a hopeless case. i violently swipe away, as if i could just push it all away, as if i could just pretend that all was well. i always do anyway. i've learnt now it doesn't pay to show people who you are inside, it's scary. it's easier to just pretend, be numb, it always is.  i am lost for a while. disorientated and confused, i forget about the scrabble game that i am kicking ass online, i forget about the 1700 word research paper i have to turn in tomorrow nor about the seven hundred and forty two worries i've been trying to figure out. no, right now, all my thoughts are consumed in what you are saying. and maybe perhaps how my heart is screaming and bleeding...the masochist in me enjoying this torture.   i remember how he still comes in and reads my soul, my thoughts, the things i have to say for the day...and he comes too close. or how he uses it against me later, and it hurts. i hurt.   i am seeing someone new but he's scarred me for life. i take equal blame, i was a bitch. a slut. a whore. a i-don't-know-what-else, whatever name of the day he's decided to bestow on me i suppose. i used to think i knew what love was too...but if love is what i think it is, then i don't want it. and so i get afraid. head for the nearest exit while another person i've pushed away comes running after me, corners me and i yell. i scream. i fight it to death and it's too late. i've drawn them to fear, to understand, i've drove them away. i always drive them away...maybe i've learnt the best way how to.   this new guy fits almost everything i've wanted in a man. artistic, sensitive, sensible, kind, gentle, understanding, loving, patient. director, producer, actor, talent, friend, companion, lover...he is so many things i could wish for yet nothing at all. i am afraid, and this fear drives me insane. i am questioning if i am enough, because the other person has taught me how to. so nights like tonight, when i weep for all that i've lost, all that i've gained, and all that i'm giving away...i remember again that hearts do break. and i'm not alone.  so thank you.

April Fools Day?  APRIL FOOLS DAY?  A P R I L .. F R E A K I N ' .. F O O L S .. D A Y .. ????????    lol.  oh come on old man...  we love you too!  :P  p/s gotcha!  heh.  ---  missed you at the head doctor's today.  :)  ...she does good.     and it isn't just the medicine.    two points?  though she talks again about having more pills to play with. the girl stumbles around admist theories and 'working on things' ; for once a week, she sits on this offbeat randomly colored room to get her head fixed. what her mind cannot do, her heart sets out to mend. they feed her a teaspoon of confidence and happiness each week, not too much, not too little either. they guide her through mazes and lets her pick out crayons to color her world, steps to help her dance and she is grateful. one more session while her mom is around, they bring in reinforces...they teach her how to open. to share. to let go.   they teach her it's okay....she's okay.  they teach her the things she's afraid to know.  she stays.  ---  barker's taking her out tomorrow.   reverting back to what he originally set to do on their first date.  she smiles, he's so damn adorable sometimes.    silly boy.

      stereo blares: this very place again..machines whirring, television humming, me on his lap. we alternate, ignore the gnawing voices...tonight we make peace.   cast meeting goes better than expected, whispering, running through lines with his lips just a hair away from my ears. giggling, making faces, sharing a cigarette, changing voices, accepting directions.   welcoming again...in the kitchen. peeling hands away from each other, wanting to touch, to kiss, to feel, but afraid. but hesitant. drawing closer, coming closer...too dangerous to be left alone. why the hell are we alone?  words exchanged, perhaps a bit like slam poetry only rickety, nervous. unsure of boundaries or rules, afraid of wrong choices of words...dead roses in the corner of the eye. sentimental reasons? she smiles, but cries. they look so dead / he kept it.   wow.  he shows her the long forgotten song..and the other about going down to the river. ani difranco settling in the room, hash in the corner...a blind eye turned.   he stands his ground.   she walks again.  ...he holds her hand.

      it's interesting how it's three in the morning and i've stuck chinese food in the microwave with full intention of throwing it back out later.   it's even more amusing to sit with your friends at the wiped off counter of waffle house being served by a woman that's become your insomniac little group's surrogate grandmother then looking down to a plate of breakfast foods and making out markers in your mind of the reverse order in which this will come out. it's like two people in your head debating how much slack the other would give.   so what's it guys?  full blown out, puke till i bleed tonight? or it's okay, we'll let you off easy, just reach the eggs racheal night?  the sad thing would be, i'm willingly writing this post without even being slightly ever intoxicated and i can lick the dried tear stains off my cheek and feel my nose bleed beginning to clot up somewhere within my nostrils. not a pretty picture innit? ugly. say it bitch. you're ugly. fat. retarded. sick.  bring it on you fuckers.   it's not like you have to be me anyway.

      it's a quarter after seven and lost rays from the sun going down pierces through my windows and i feel so lost in my own little world. i have tears running down my cheeks, smeared mascara lines and lots and lots of pictures smiling back at me from me desktop. i'm used to freezing my butt off in here but tonight there is nothing, i am neither cold nor hot, neither comfortable nor terribly uncomfortable. the hours tick off slowly but surely...so little time left, so many things to do. some hours, the excitement mounts, some minutes, they just go all the way down completely.   i am feeling melancholic and very unbalanced right now, as if i'm the peak of my cycle and i charting out the course, watching as i fall down fast and hard too, waiting for the crash. tylenol has been my god lately, i think it's a stage people go through in life where you look to chemicals to attempt to numb the pain. it's as if my mind has it set that i need pain-killers, for six million pains and aches my body comes out with but yet an unfilled prescription of prozac sits admidst my box of whacked out thrash, memorabilia of moments.   it's funny how people think a pill is going to make them normal.   it's funny how some people want to believe it is.   yet it's even funnier how some people are just stupid and don't know what they want nor what they believe in.  there are days where i am so high, so high....flying and soaring, tearing up and ripping through everything i see, everything i touch, everything i feel. nights like last night where it was so amazing, and i was so happy. intoxicated maybe, but i could feel and i smiled. laughed. where we walked through streets and felt the sand beneath our feet, where we played and dared and went from balcony to balcony, tit to tit, addiction to addiction. where we rolled down the top and belted on top of our lungs and honked at strangers and flirted with disaster. where we made friends along the strip and watched the little old guy kissed the forehead of the little girl and the couple with blooming roses and the street partiers with the jacked up, hyped up, boomers and bass.   where we got to know so and so and this and that happened, where we switched waffle houses and had a massive array of variety and to where we rode home together and toned down with classical and opera and discussed life long dreams and hopes and needs.   in two days, i leave and don't return for another good three months.   it's an odd feeling.   my mom bitches on the phone, i've pissed her off somehow because my manic mind has taken over and i cannot seem to concentrate and she's getting so frustrated. i'm frustrated too, but i don't know how to tell anyone, i don't know how to deal with it. it's as if i'm spiralling down and i honest to god, do not know what in the hell to do. to hold on and prolong the madness or to crash so things start looking up again?  good question really.  and here i sit in the dark cos darkness is my friend and that pisses the shit fuck out of me. i've had a good streak for way too long and i've gotten used to it that this almost feels new. i don't know what to do with myself. i've been throwing up again, and hurting myself not too good, i'm startign to feel the way i've felt before...when things were on their way to bad you know? don't get me wrong, i've still been doing the shit i do it's just that this time, when i do it, it's not out because of a daily routine but because i cannot stand to look at the girl in the mirror again. i look like a massive orgy of ugly fat people that decided to hook up with psychosomatic retarded bitches. i hate me right now, which isn't right, because a while ago, i was really really fine. i was happy. i loved me. but most of all, i was proud of me.  i look at that piece of paper that justifies everything and the first and only thing that comes to mind is bullfuckingshit racheal, this isn't you.   and then i think to myself honestly, i don't know who i am. i don't know what i'm worth nor who i'm really all about. quite frankly, i don't really give two hoots about anything. yet i do all at the same time.   we have philosophical talks and talks about religion and education and third world countries. we make jokes and have a good laugh. we play tricks and decide to walk down the boulevard butt naked then take the boats out and skinnydip. and i still don't fit in. or at least my mind doesn't because i don't feel like i'm completely all there anymore. like i'm losing it and i'm never completely one hndred percent anything.   i don't know. i'm talking way too much for someone that has to be ready in an hour, and hell knows, i need more than an hour.

      sweat glistens off sparkling skin, lavender slathered pored out as running shoes squish on a moist pavement and the alarm beeps as the grandfather clock that greets her sounds twelve rings. midnight; the ending of an exhausting, productive, stressed, retarded, interesting day...the sounding of a brand new morning. a two hour jog across the bridge, around the bay, into wally's world and in pitch black darkness...there's something awfully enticing about the dark innit?   cramps, shortness of breath, searing pains, drugged out body but the brain jets through at six million miles and hour and her thought process works on overtime, overload. little categories formed in little bits of her mind, trying to get it all together...trying to put things and feelings together to understand. understand...that is a nice word isn't it?  help me, my name is stressed. i am the demon that creeps into solitary emptiness and feeds on it, i am the fear that terrifies and keeps you up and about at night, i am the reason you bounce of walls and run off into tangents, i am the reason you are imbalanced, insecure, frustrated.   help me, my name is insomnia...and i am the one that generates energy even after half a bottle of pills, i am the image that plays in your mind of your fucked up self, i am the saving grace of your other being and the wonder of your amazement. i am the reason you are alive.   help me, my name is bullimia. i am the ugly image of your otherwise perfect bullshit life. i am the one that drives you to take a million baths, the one that scoops you up caffienated ice cream after a good throw up to soothe your bleeding stomach, your bleeding esophagus. i am the reason why the back of your knuckles are calloussed from the backs of your teeth biting in as you force your fingers down. i am the bitch that feeds you jacked up pictures of magnified poportions of your every flaw. i am that face you stare back in the mirror that says, fat bitch. ugly bitch. retarded bitch. i am the being you come to for comfort, i am the reason you seek comfort.   help me, my name is suicide. i am the cheap stupid journey you attempt to take every couple of months, sometimes weeks...depending on how fast i work with the other halfs. i am the half version of what your selfless ass attempts to do but your cowardly mind stops you. i am the person that works hand in hand with depression to bring you down. down. down. i'll bring you down one day, i'll shatter your defenses, i'll rule your world one day.   help me, my name is depression and i love what an achoring place i hold in your mind. i love how i can creep into your innermost thoughts and take the simple, most silliest darnest thing in the world and use it to my advantage. i love how i can torment you night or day, dusk or dawn, january through december. i am the protecting arms that hold you in the still of midnight and encase you into all that i can drive you into. i am the tears you cry, the scars you bleed, the questions you seek. i have every capability of turning all rights into wrong, and then somemore. i amthe cause of instability in your life, the reason you run, the reason you fly, the reason you love, the reason your past comes haunting to bite you in the ass but most of all, i am the reason you are the way you are.   help us, we are the voices in her head. we dig our claws in deep and penetrate her every being, her every inch that covers her body and her every pound she counts meticulously. we are vicious, and we are stern. we yell, we scream, we throw horrible temper tantrums and rule her life. we take her through these amazing highs...in control all the time, only to reveal ourselves and the bigger plan. we drag her by her hairs and enjoy the scraping of skin, the bleeding, every tear drop that falls. we lick her every whimper, cry, and thrive on it. she feeds us with her addictions, she feeds us with her commitment. the more she shakes us off, the harder we come back the next time. her constant repetition of taking ten steps forward and falling back a million provides us more than we'll ever need but yet, like everything else in this world, greed consumes us and we are selfish. always wanting more. always testing to see how much further we can go. always enjoying another good meal.   help me, my name is racheal and i cannot stop myself from hurting tonight. i am numb from everything but still hurting inside. my throat is parched, my lungs are stretched, my heart is tired and my whole fucking body feels like a dead log. my thoughts are swirling, my bags are packed, my fears are escalating by the every minute.   i am leaving. i am afraid.   excited.   i hate this bi existence. this living of two worlds.   where the, what the, who the fuck am i?  do you know me?  do you need me?  am i part of your world?  am i a point to this existence?  am i of any use?  are you as sick and tired of me as i am?  whining, crying, yelling, screaming, sarcastic, dumb, stupid, long assed, shit piece of crap.   i am not strong enough to slice my wrists yet even weaker to live in this world.   hormones and chemical imbalances don't go well at all but i'm alright. i'm always alright. just give it a couple of days, a couple of hours more of being awake, another six messages and i'll be fine. i'm always fine. i am fine.

        chrisr  (2:08 AM) :   i don't think anything of great worth was ever done by a well balanced person.  balance is overrated.  hence the mad scientist stereotype.  einstein wasn't the epitomy of well balancedness.  nor was bach.  to be very good at something, you have to neglect other things, and hence create unbalance.  i consider it a definite plus.  also; i've reached a stage where i quite genuinely don't care what other people think of me.  unless they know me well enough to respect how i am.  so, no, it doesn't bother me.  i'm very happy to be unbalanced, though one has to be aware of the downsides to that, and everyone else can cheerily go to hell :)  in a nice way, of course.

      hey babe,   yes, you have every right to kill me, castrate me, and feed me to the starving kids in somalia.   lol, so i absolutely bawled my eyes out listening to your messages last night then realizing quite pathetically that i'd missed you leaving and that you'd tried so many times but her royal stupidness had switched off the phone. for some odd reason, i was bloody afraid, wondering...be safe babe, i'd like to see you again.   but yeah, so here i am, publically admitting that i am a very stupid cared for girl that needs to put her brains together fix things.   thank you for everything you, and for the emails.   take care...i'll see you around.   lets shoot a movie!  :)

      i'm lonely, it's hard to explain something like this. it's like being lost in a crowd, being surrounded by so many people, being with so many people yet still being the only one. the faceless one. fading away, sinking in, losing grip on something real, something there, something to know.   i keep on needing to remind myself this is the beginning of an ending and things are going great! going fantabulous! going absolutely amazing! i keep telling myself that if anything, i have to be alright, be strong for him, for the others. stay alright for a million people yet it's hard when things just don't feel right and so many emotions run through you.   tears run, anger lashed, laughter rings.  afraid of changing, craving for difference, for breath to feel so fresh, so alive. for every draw of air that enters through your lungs to give life, to feel like it's giving life and that you are not just dying slowly...bit by bit. pieces. breaking away.   it feels like such a horrible existence, to be flying and crashing at the same time. to try and hide scabs and scars as you primp and perform. to dance among the pixies and feel like a fairy...your feet so light and wings like a butterfly fluttering yet to find the flipside of it where your nails are broken, your insides bleeding, your sanity questioned and you, as a being, so unloved. unwelcomed. unwanted. by your own self. you can't look into the mirror, it hurts more to know you do sometimes, it hurts more to be up and down and left and right. to hold a knife in your hands, to shake a bottle of pills, to find the easy way out because you're so goddamn sick of trying. fighting. to be so goddamned sick.   the therapist says you need to go to tc for a while...what do you do? you walk out and never return. mental health smanzy, bullshit melodramatic excuses anyway. so you've been off for a month and a half now, it's like the meds you keep stored away...what the fuck ever you say. you throw it, you crush it, you deny it. it pisses you off that you are not enough, that you aren't strong enough. it hurts you that you aren't complete, that you have to depend on such things to stay alive...and so you rebel, as always, you rebel against it. fight it. strive for independence. i'm okay. i'm okay. i'm okay.  don't need anything.  don't need anyone.  don't need a damn thing.  fucking needy bitch.   it's late and the world starts to tune down as the little town begins to sleep, nothing is left but bare empty silence of nothingness. of emptiness. there is a gaping hole from where the tears begin, to where i am calm. tugging, being torn apart and pulled from every angle. the conscious mind versus the unconsious, the rational versus the crazy, the manic versus the depressive. what the fuck is wrong with me?  little things. small things. miniscule retarded pathetic things that throw everything off balance. hormones. chemicals. emotions. people. thoughts. feelings. understanding.   packing, returning, knowing. i'm going home, i cannot wait...i cannot wait to come home. fall into familiar arms, show myself, find myself, try myself. i cannot wait to climb higher mountains, soar different skies but yet i'm so afraid to. some days i am so bloody hessistant, some days i don't know what things are going to be like, some days i am absolutely embarassed because i am so different now and it scares me to be alone again. it scares me to step into this world i've lived in for long yet gone away from too....but i want to. i need to. i must.  it is something i know, at times even, it is the only thing i know.   my life is so dang perfect right now it's frustrating. i list down all that i have and the sheets of paper i have are not enough, yet why do i get so damn upset on nights like this? why do i get so hard on myself? why do i still feel so incomplete?  is it love i'm searching for? is it education? is it a career, a degree, a perfect bloody thing to hang on? what exactly do i need? what exactly am i looking for?   i don't know, i don't know and that frustrates me.  i lay with my head on double pillows and tonight there is no one to comfort me. i wait for his arms to find my waist and squeeze me, i wait for his kisses to trail my body as i am sleeping, i wait for his voice to soothe me to sleep as he tells me of his dreams, and sings, and talks about nothing and everything. i twist and turn finding for his chest to let his heartbeat calm me to sleep..for his smile to greet me as i awake and for his body to keep me warm as night falls, for protection as the night demons haunt.   but i've let him go. i've sent him off. we said goodbye today...our final one as he leaves on a long journey to jersey and me back to malaysia for the summer. funny how we tried to categorize our relationship last night and drew nothing, we laughed...we smiled...we played. not exactly fuck buddies yet not forever either. almost like an in between, a teacher, a guider...him for me, and me to him.   he calls me gorgeous, and sexy, and beautiful. he sits and tells me about the things i mean to him, the things i mean to the world and the things i have to do...my part of the deal in life. he holds my hand and he holds it tight...we do lovey-dovey corny make me sick things together, for each other. we are emotionally attached yet still very much single. i call him the person that fills my void, the friend that steps in. the fucking lover.   i tell him about the people i am meeting and he laughs about the silly things i talk about, the names i give them. he gets a little jealous but then he knows he has no right to be. as i have none. we step away from our existence and examine comfort. he tells me he'll miss me, i say me too.   it's real, it's genuine, only that we know we have things we need to do.   i think about the people at home. i think about the kids, my family, the exes, me friends. i think about acceptance and continuance and redundance. i think about change and difference and ignorance. what now? how? i know it's going to be different but how different is different going to be?  i think about how i leave in less then a week. i am excited and sad, i am afraid and happy, i am unnerved and fucking flying. califuckingfornia in a week. shit.  it's taken me two hours to write this, in between instant messages and literati games...in between trying to calm the fuck down..running from bored to pissed to sad to crying to calm. and that's where i stand now, calm.  i threw up tonight. bled.   i guess this shit never really ends does it?  i'm okay though, i'll be alright  ...i'm just bloody fantastically fine.

      my moon is your moon.   that just astounds me...  because i thought i saw the most incredibly beautiful full moon the other night and here you are, millions and trillions of miles away telling me the very same thing. it makes me smile that you noticed, that you're not too caught up in the drama of life, in the evil corporate influences and that you have time to stop and smell the flowers, watch a sunset, dance in the moonlight. that comforts me.   we've been talking a lot the last couple of days, running up the phone bill, running up the internet bill, running up charges that begins at the top of our heads to the ends of our asses. we're both of stature, both from about the same background, hell i've grown up with you and you've played in my neighbourhood as i have yours plenty of times. we've dated on and off and on again. you were my first everything, well almost anyway. the first person i ran from, the first person i fell in love with, the first person i left, the first person that loved me, the first person i hurt, the first person i let go. you were my first of everything, the first time i discovered i was a woman, the first time i had a 'real' relationship, not the silly kindergarten la di da we play in school, my first valentine i hoped for....and received.   there's this fine line of where you stand, there are always tests with me. i offered last night, to bring you back anything you wanted. i'd asked this before, half my suitcase is filled with things for other people, things they need, things i have to take into account...and you, like any other, i expect to run off into a whole list of things. it's funny how people take a lot of things for granted...yet i know i am guilty of that crime too. but anyway, i get so used in having to pay for something, buy something, bring back things, do a big huge favor, purchase expensive gifts and i waited for you to name of six million things. nevermind that i knew you had expensive taste too, in a lot of ways, we are so alike and i can never picture you in a thrift shop getting excited over a shirt that's going for a quarter...maybe it's ignorance? maybe it's just realizing that value is what you give it. i guess i've changed quite a bit and in a lot of ways i'm afraid of going home, and in other ways, fucking proud to step off the plane.   but anyway, all you said was for me to come home safe. then you told me you missed me.   it was so incredibly corny and genuine at the same time i burst out laughing and crying.   nothing can ever take away that moment because i realized then all the reasons why i love you and will always love you. friendship is a beautiful thing and i'm glad we have had nothing come in the way of that. it's funny how we can not speak for a couple of months and pick things back up where they ended. it's even funnier how close we are without trying, how there's always that unspoken tension, how the taboos of society are what ultimately separates us, separated us.   life is one funny fruitcake and never in a million years would i have ever expected myself to be sitting here, so many miles away, reminiscing over silly times..okay, i lied. i do that constantly, but anyway, it was all good.   and it's a good feeling going home to someone that you know will accept you for whoever, whatever you are.   thank you because i know you read this from time to time.   you are amazing!  :)

      i'm tired of making up excuses...ever get there you know? where you have to justify everything you say, everything you do. every smile, every tear, every laugh. it feels as if when i'm happy, there is a voice in the back of my head that waits for me to fall and when i'm sad, it's just the same old thing. there are so many nights where i am alone, alone in this torturous existence, alone in this chemical imbalance, alone in this shit of a disease they call manic depressive. i listen to music, i play music, i sing to bloody music but music only spurs me further...it elevates me, it moves me, it spears me right through the heart. it's what i breathe, it's my best tool of communication, it is the thing that represents me, speaks for me yet it is the very thing that tears me down.  i tell him i'm going crazy. that in my little mind and my little thoughts i have come out with six million disorders. barker says every damn bastard on the street has something now, that they're feeding his brother a.d.d. medication and that they could prolly label him with six thousand different things because of his childhood, because he is who he is. as he casually tells me in bed one day as lie down that he fits in all the symptoms for depression and he somehow finds that amusing.   i'm tired of depression. i'm tired of the damn word, i'm tired of the disease, i'm tired of every dang thing it represents. ever feel like something is eating you alive? that's what it feels like, whether i'm super duper happy, on a high, or very low...it's always there. it's a pain in my big fat butt and i am so god damn bloody sick of it. i wish it'd go away. i wish it'd suck my yellow ass and fucking mutilate itself.   i'm frustrated as a piss fuck right now.   this is apparently, according to the big wigs in white suits, 'part of the disease'. part of the disease my ass and i'm supposed to just accept it? just deal with it? well, i can't. and it's fruystrating. because i'm pissed for no apparent reason, crying for no apparent reason. you know what the world feels like in here? it feels like it's crashing, screaming, scratching nails on a chalk board unbearingly fucked up and i am so goddamn sick of it. i want to throw something, hit something, cut myself, throw up, jump up and down and run into walls.  i write this and there are two sides of me. rational and irrational.  rational says what the fuck are you doing racheal? you sound like a crazy psychopathic bitch.  irrational says i am a crazy psychopathic bitch.  goddamnit, i am so angry and i don't even know why. why i am the way i am. why i am never ever happy, or satisfied? why does everything need to be so damn perfect in my life? why i am never ever happy with what i have?   this is me being an immature selfish brat.  this is the ugly side i try to hide but can't contain.  this is the awful part of me i hate showing anyone.  this is falling, and crashing, and licking the ground because it's sweeter than tasting myself.   i am angry, pissed, livid....the hardest part is not knowing why. the worst part is not knowing where to start.   fuck me.

      it's odd how you think you know someone, then you scrape a little harder or flip to another side and you discover this whole new realm you never knew; there's a little nervous shiver filled with excitement as you dig a little deeper, a little harder...hoping, searching, wanting to discover more and more and more till everything overflows though you don't think you'll ever reach that stage, you don't think you'll ever reach a point where it's too much, or it gets too trite; no, life is too damn complexing beautiful for that. life has too many dang intricate details to be overlooked, put away, given up upon.   i stand on my high stool preaching, rambling six million thoughts that cross my mind at this very second purring, slinking away. lights turned down low, so low it's dark yet enough to put off a glow that illuminates the room. little candles, big candles, broken candles, burnt out candles...an aura so enticing, so comforting radiated. this is home, this is me, this is life.   it's the single breath of life that feeds you everything you need, the voice on the other end, the smile on a person's face, the twinkle of an eye. it is the first time you watched a butterfly perch onto a blade of grass, the first time you flew a kite, the first time your bare feet touched soft white sand...the second time you woke up to someone loving you, the second time you saw an absolutely amazing sunset, the fifth time you felt tiny arms around your waist begging to play, the millionth time you thanked some entity above. it is that crack in the middle of the night, the run down empty fluorescent lighted restocking wal*mart newly polished floors at the break of dawn, the ecstacy of driving a machine at any rate you want, challenging the other insomniacs on the road..making friends. it is that last cigarette you share with a friend as you laugh, cry, rant, bitch together. it's the shots you down together, the salivating salt that's followed by the stinging of spirits and the tearing of lime. or lemon. or whatever you prefer. it's the virgin asking if you'd be the one, it's the lusty, excited, scared, tempted look of evil. it is the starting and ending of a promise, the beginning of a journey and an ending of a lifetime. it is being forgiven, forgiving, letting go and being let go of.  it is having the best conversation ever on the phone, one which you will smile about and laugh at for the next couple of days, it is that feeling of knowing you are loved and that you love, it is that reciprocation of care, and trust. it's open arms waiting for your return and smiling faces at the end of an exhausting trip. it's when your days all string together and everyday feels like a dream, like a new day, like a holiday.   when the dog sits at your feet with the cat by it's side and they both want you to play catch with them, it is the first time you discovered love, the second time you fell in love, the third time you gave love. it is the fourth, the fifth, the sixth, the eigth because they are never the same. it is his look, his expression, her eyes, her lips, his carefully chosen words, her legs, your fingers, his arms.   it is sitting down on a saturday night going through films, thinking about what the head doctor said, holding a plane ticket in your hand, marvelling at the retribution of hard work paid off and enjoying the silence.   loving the silence.   dancing in the silence.  :)  hugs.

      so i've been stuck in a haze of pissiness and being cranky and in between dusting pixiedust off my chests and chests of drawers, thumb tacking random pictures up on my wall and "artistically" arranging dried roses onto different portions of my bedroom wall, i've been bored shitless, restless, and frustrated.   i do however seek retreat once in a while (try every ten minutes) and change my away messages about a billion times a day promising to give head, lick asses, fuck someone's brains out, castrate assholes and fly across the moon.   packing is a bitch and i've accumulated quite a bit over the last nine months..apparently, i am a sensitive, pathetic, sentimental fool. it's sad.   :P  on a side note however, my room is looking spankingly clean and i am quite fascinated with the redesign. i took art pieces from stuff i worked on in the last few months, dried roses, random scraps of fabric as well as odd ends and pieces of metal and tacked it all up on the wall. it is now a clash of cultures with stars and stripes versus asian print...kind of a familiar theme innit?  :P  kim's leaving for melbourne tomorrow and andrew's bitching for me to go along, and just for the clueless, melbourne is an hour out of orlando which is a long eight hour drive and just for the uninformed is where i've been for the last week. somehow reliving that nightmare/dream seems kinda terrifying and exciting at the same time. nonetheless though, my ass is staying in pensacola.   i've been sworn to a couple of favors and promises that needs to get done in the next couple of days.   nice thought though.  in another thread, I MISS BARKER!  :(  this sucks.  which reminds me, i have photo evidence of his sexy body being developed. life is sweet...  thank god for heavenly visions.   :P  talk to you asses later...send me some love.   or late night 1800-hot calling cards.   either one really.   ...maybe even batteries.   arf.

      barker leaves for missouri tonight.   it's not a good feeling.  i have so much and nothing to say, this has been a rather odd week. we spent much of yesterday and today together, in between sleeping and talking and singing, i didn't get much done. soaking up after being away from each other a while, and soaking up for the upcoming long months ahead.   he strokes my hair and i catch him looking at me when i sleep, i find his fingers to twine with mine...his muscles give me the security and strength i need. he smiles, giggles sometimes, and laughs at me, only that he tries to convince me that it is with me. and i roll my eyes and mock him and we play fight in bed.   he gets shy sometimes and you watch as his cheeks and ears turn red, red, redder. and he sorta does this giggle laugh thing and hides beneath the blanket even if it's obvious that many would die to be in my place...yet he still calls me beautiful. and sexy. yet he still thinks i'm special.   i watch him pull that white t-shirt over this morning as his muscles flex and his abs say hel-lo. it is hard not to jump on him sometimes, he calls me his nymphomaniac. it's equal game though, equal addiction so hah i say.   it's going to be weird to not have someoen to come home to or make dinner for me, even weirder when there are no roses anymore. i'm going to miss him as he assures me he will too...and i know he will. it is the gentle way he holds my hand to let me know he cares, it is that look in his eyes that look into mine that make me feel so important and special all at once, it is the little things he does in the big scheme of things...it is his mind, his intelligence, his wit that turns me on the most. that after all that's said and done, the person, the soul, the being deep within is what i adore the most.   11:23.  he got off work an hour and a half ago. left early...i'm not even exaggerating when i say that boy works like a damn dog. he has his dreams, his hopes, his visions and so many can concoct them but not many live them. he's getting there and every day he works on it a little more, i have nothing but absolute faith in him, he's one of those people that do what their heart sets out to do...if anything, those are the reasons why i step back. because my reluctance becomes a damper in his journey.   we are different people...yet sometimes so alike. we are strange and odd and very muchly so queer. we have our own thoughts about the world and the private pains we hide at night. he talked about crying last night, then told me this morning that he did. i've never seen him cry before, and i felt like shit knowing that i didn't wake up while his teardrops fell next to me. i was knocked out completely from the road trip and from using every single ounce of energy left, he tells me stories at night....and sings to me. or he downloads some new song he thinks i'll like or something new to share. his back hurt like a bitch, and without medication it drove him to tears. i wish i could have soothed him the way he's soothed my nights...and i'm sorry i wasn't there. or that i was, but not really, as he apologized this morning in case he woke me up.  he lets me peek through windows into his world, it's a different game completely there. he shows me what it's like to be him, and live his life, he lets me walk through his footprints and pushes me forward when i am reluctant. he teaches me about simplicity and intelligence, priorities and understanding, he teaches me about barker.   in three months, we will change. i will go home and he'll be back in jersey and we'll learn more about ourselves again. we touch on how it'll be to come together again in the fall to shoot the movie...how strange, how odd, how weird things would be. how much would we have learned? what would we have achieved? how different would we be as individuals? how odd will things be for us? will we fall in love over the summer? will we find our special someones?  he mocks him and that hurts me. i turn away and cry to silence as he whispers in my ears and begs again. he doesn't understand, and neither will i ever know about her. we try and convince ourselves of things he tells me, but somehow, i know and believe, someday that would be me. someday i will be strong enough, big enough, worth enough...and you know what, that someday looms near because i am enough. and strong. and hell bloody worth it.   "walk away."  i'll make you proud silly, just as i know you already somewhat are.   that made you smile didn't it?  take care babe, i'll talk to you later. drive safe and i miss you.

      mustang, puck and i watched an incredible display of fireworks the other night at epcot, so spectacular, so amazing, so dang fantastic as towers lit up to cues of music and fountain springs danced, globes turned and projected across a million people as lazers beamed through the sky illuminating lit up mesmerized faces, enchanted smiles and the little kid lost in the magic of disney in all our eyes...it was beautiful.   a moment so genuine, so innocently naive shared but lost at the same time...of adjustments made with the chemicals in my brain and work lights flooding thoughts as they came together into a massive attack of symphony, and sound, and correlation as the night ended and we wrapped up our trip.   one day late, but one day gained. an extra day of basking in the sun, giggling with friends, swimming and dancing, splashing in cool waters soothing the parched sunburned skin as thoughts met eye to eye and conversations took off, jokes played, and an ending to beginning formed.   new goals, renewed dreams, as magic carpet rides on this journey of leaps and loves, of drops and soaring, of ups then downs...so much to do, so much to see, so many emotions...such simple amazement.   things happening, things changing, things shifting from extreme to comfortable to maturity plugged into the life long collection of the lessons in life. love lost and gained, thoughts realized and concocted, the basic virginity of being scared, excited and amazed at penetration for the first time; a beautiful, absolutely gorgeous feeling of coming to terms.   mother's day, comfortable in my skin; stripped naked and bare but beautiful...loved. kisses trail, skin on skin..learning about myself, oozing confindence it's almost disgusting. driving to cocoa and back with nothing on but smiles and laughs, a new discovery of self...a vacation of mind, a lesson learned and a lesson taught. taking off with wings soaring through the sky as a new chapter begins and i am old and young again.   moralities, integrity, wants hopes and dreams questioned by evil, putrid desires as confidence stands back and says this time i win.   ---  old man and barker greets us, familiar faces at the end of a long, long eight hour journey. at first there were four, and then there were two. two tired, hyper, melancholic girls step off the greyhound bus, buzzing with stories and tales and dreams with picture frame rememberance in the minds of the boys waving goodbye and mustang's hands pressed against the glass. taurus and puck beginning on an uncertain journey of discovering friendship, then lust...and maybe love.   bongo and his 'bongoes' recovering from a week of crazy screaming lunatics. waiting this morning for bongo to bust out some weird one liner and tell us more stories as i awoke and for caress to fix us the breakfast of champions as he fixes himself another samolian dinner.   thanks for the eight days guys, contrary to the other two and the backlashing, bitching, stabbing, screaming, yelling...we had an awesome experience.   thank you mustang for disney, for 12-7 talks, cigarette breaks and being a great bed buddy.    my body aches with muscles stretched and tanned skin makes me kinda giggly. it's a quarter after six in the evening and barker and i have slept the whole day away after a night of intense grouping. "rejuvenating"...whatever the hell you wnat to call it really. it was damn good fun though.   barker leaves in four days as he sits behind me ringing up the cast and putting things together before missouri and new jersey take place. summer's here and i leave again in a couple of days, it's a brilliant feeling...a little scared, very excited, and a little sad.   ---  old man, i love you.   ---   urlLink  "I am not a child now. I can take care of myself. I mustn't let them down now- Mustn't let them see me cry. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm to tired to listen. I'm too old to believe: All these childish stories. There is no such thing as faith, And trust, And pixie dust. I try, But its to hard to believe. I try, But I can't see what you see. I try. I try. I try. My whole world is changing, I don't know where to turn. I can't leave you baby, But I cant stay and watch the sitting burn; Watch it burn. 'Cause I try, But its so hard to believe! I try, But I can't see where you see. I try. I try. I try and try, To understand, The distance in between: The love I feel, The things i fear, I dearly say good dream.   I can finally see it. Now I have to believe: All those precious stories. All the world is made of faith, And trust, And pixie dust. So I'll try, 'Cause I finally believe! I'll try, 'Cause I see where you see! I'll try. I'll try! I'll try! I'll try- To fly."

      hey strangers,  how's it going?  it's been a crazy couple of days and i'm finally plopped down on jeff's computer by force to be made to blog...it's an odd thing to have not much to say and everything to blog.  :)  i burned my paper journal last weekend, it was strangely very soothing in some perverted sense, like giving away and letting go a cetain part of you...all the nights, all the midnight thoughts and midday drama penned down, all the hushed secrets and forbidden ink on paper, scribblings, writings. poetry, prose, of soaring and falling and climbing back up again, it was building a dream and escaping midflight in ecstacy to a place unknown, it was falling down, bruised and broken, hurting from a million places and tear stain pages greet you, smudges from where teardrops touched paper and candle wax dripped on. it was liberating and depressing, as if something i had to do to break chains but hurt me at the same time?  in any case though, i started one in between the hours of five and six am monday morning and haven't written in it since. there's somehting soothing about being able to keep things in and not feel the pressing need to explode, it's empowering and it feeds you a certain strength of believing in yourself and confidence. a mini confidence pill i suppose?  orlando is unbelievable and nothing like i expected. the boys we're living with are the cleanest, nicest, sillliest, craziest alcoholics i've ever met. and this coming from someone who spent eight hours on the road with equally insane, hyper, dramatic, needles up their buts and strings all gone loopy people in the car. suffice to say, lots of mooning, flashing, nudity, honking, craziness went on on the way here and something tells me, it's going to be three times more when we drive back on sunday...  we did a little bit of modelling wednesday night and that was interesting for the most part and nobody ever says no to nice clothes and money eh? i love, miss, adore, revel in the big city yet we've gotten lost a good number of times but i suppose it's all good. adventurous pompous assholes. :P shopping here is about as close to getting whipped cream licked off that i can get, high-rise buildings, highways, speed demons, traffic jams, cars, noise, pollution...heaven! whoop! whoop!  i did get pissingly knackered last night though and the bits and pieces along with the headache and rumble in my tummy tells me it was probably not a pretty sight. i remember talking to barker, body shots, ass grabbing and people dissapearing into rooms plus puck's and madonna's massive orgy in the bathroom but i look at invisible tearstains and remember little of what i must have been bitching about. little bits of conversation float into my mind progressively throughout the day and i think, damn i am a sucker.   lol, she's a college student!   what a bloody trite excuse, in any case though, apparently we're going skinny dipping and sunbathing now. will blog again maybe later, but yeah. life is a goddess on crack.

      so i leave for orlando tomorrow and should be gone for about a ten days or so..i'm not really sure what to expect out of this nor how 'together' my thoughts are right now. it's hard to believe that after tomorrow, i am done with school and would have completed a whole year....it's even harder to believe that i survived that whole damn year!  my fears and concern soemtimes mount up in neat little piles and because so much constantly goes on in my head it becomes living hell every couple of weeks and we talk about the dangers of spiralling and crashing and looping, depressive one day and manic the other, independent for a couple of weeks and needy the other. it's a delicate balance that at times, i truly wish i did not have to deal with but hey, it's okay you know?  barker and i are growing apart. i haven't really said it out loud and have been putting it away but we are. we came to a decision a couple of weeks ago about how we both had to grow on our own and that as much as we enjoyed each other's company, we weren't in love. perhaps that's the recipe to it all, figure out where you stand and you will soar. for the most part, we do really good. he knows how i function and i know what ticks him off, keeps him happy, makes him safe. he knows which buttons not to push and when to let go of a subject yet there are times where i miss the magic of a beginning. the discovery, the amazement of sharing something new, the excitement of revealing/finding out something new...perhaps that's what explains itself that as much, and as simple as it would be, we aren't really meant for each other, neither are we really the one.   in some sense, i have a general rough sketch, and it's hard to live with your past. it's hard to open three hundred doors before you and come to terms with the person you are but so many times, i look into the mirror and as much as the very same image that stares back at me utterly revolts me and pisses me off, i cannot help but love her, i cannot help but want to help her. help me. accept me.   we all have dreams in life, and when you fulfill one dream and watch it come to life, you build more and more and see them come to life too. my life has been a series of fulfilled dreams and sometimes dashed hopes. i get up and i get down, i watch myself bleed and let myself cry and the other night, i just felt so utterly sorry for myself and so i cried. no big deal at all, something that i would have normally felt so dirty and so wrong for i accepted.   i cried and i sobbed and it hurt but the pain soothes away and tears dry off. i climbed into bed with barker already asleep, looking so peaceful he waited for me to come but i stayed back behind downstairs to finish up a couple of things and so many times i think, it's absolutely beautiful how mundane things fit in so nice. sleeping on the couch together, taking a drive, going grocery shopping, walking the dog. picking up chinese food...stupid shit like that i crave for. non-drama stuff, non-special things that become so special in their own right. it's silly but i look forward to nights where we just lay in bed and talk, or to days that we don't have to do anything extraordinary at all...thrift store shopping, red-light snogging, falling asleep to a warm body. skin on skin.  i have had issues i've needed to deal with and trust me, there's been a couple. it hasn't been high flying all the way and it certainly hasn't been easy. we're such different people yet we're alike in some odd way which just irritates the piss out of me at times because i can't just yell and scream and throw a tantrum, because i know how it'd feel. now, doesn't that suck? racheal having to be all reasonable and shit...fuck that! :P  we both get our nights where the world just seems so dark and wrong, or drives where it's hard to just concentrate on going on, and there are so many times i try and push things away and not let them get to me and those times, undoubtedly, are really, really hard but hey, i'm here ain't i? melancholy is truly a fucked up feeling, missing someone, messing up, trying again and all that crap is such damn bloody hard work to sift through but then he holds my hand, and i grab on to his, but then he looks into my eyes, but then he holds me close and he says we always can talk. and i know now the things i wish i knew when i was younger, and i know now that above everything else that we're friends and we always will be.   how do i justify us sleeping together? how do i justify this relationship? how do i justify all the issues that surround all the shit that life always has to come with? i don't know. i just make do. i just figure it out as we go along...  no, we aren't together. yes, i do care for him. no, i don't know what's going to happen over the summer and yes, we need our time apart.   see, the crazy thing about it is that we both have dreams, and we both have things we need to go off and do for ourselves, both great big unresolved shit we need to find closure to and i know it's so hard to be on the outside looking in but clarity is something that just makes life boring and trite. some day, when i grow old, i'm going to look back at these crazy times and realize i had one hell of an amazing life..because as pathetic as this may seem, i look back at my tumultuous years and think, wow, i've had an amazing life and i am grateful. i am special.   i need to be, as i've needed for a while now, to be my own person. to learn about me, to live in my head a while and not feel the pressing need to kill myself...and so far, having barker around has helped. we get what we need from each other, some call it using, some call it dirty, and some call it wrong. i call it being there for each other, i call it friendship. i call it caring. he cares, i care, he needs, i need, he gives, i give, he takes, i take. and so that's how that works.   we shoot the movie when i come back in the fall...what if we fall in love over the summer? now how ackward would that be? yes, it would be strange, but then again, everything about us is strange and like everything else, we'll deal with it. don't mix work with play, don't mix directions with friendship, don't mix lust and love....and so we won't. and so we'll make it. i think. we'll survive. :P  he leaves for jersey about a week before i do, resumes the bits and pieces and puts it all together again. carries his responsibilities and the things he knows he needs to do for the movie and himself, discover himself, live his dreams, learn more about the world...and like wise i'll go home a little unsure, a little scared, very excited and certainly different. nine months away is a bloody long time and there's been so many twists and turns to this whole living thing it just gets crazy sometimes but you know what, i kinda enjoy it. as much as i bitch, as much as i moan and swear i hate this living thing, it gets kinda nice sometimes.   the site has picked up a couple more visitors in the last few months, friends i'd like to say..and so sometimes when i check my stats and get to know these numbers, ip addresses, internet servers, it's almost a game we play. silent lurkers, odd random emails, crypted notes sent at the right times, blinded. they come in succession, sometimes all at once, and sometimes none at all.   i know i'm different than the sarahkate that posted a year and a half ago, and that i've changed from the girl that wrote lost love letters online and the girl that played out drama on the internet. i've evolved from the bulimic, sick, psycho bitch but i am still her. i am still that person and she is still so much a part of me and it's brilliant to go in and realize someone else is saying, hey, i kinda like you just for who you are. hey, thanks for trying. hey thanks for helping. and then you stop and say holy shit, and then you stop and say, i'm just like you, i'm exactly like you and maybe that's why it hurts when i hurt because whatever i can do, you can do to. wherever i reach in life, whatever this point of nirvana is...you'll reach it too. i believe in me, i believe in you, i believe in that selfish bastard that lives next door to me and that little old lady that lives down the street, the asshole that steals my food at every break without fail, the idiot that bums cigarettes off me and the anarchistic dumb bitch at the corner of the road.   and so when you tell me how you're proud of me i can only tell you how grateful i am and i wish you knew how much that meant to me. when someone writes because they've felt like i could understand the pain, when someone writes to say you're beautiful, when someone writes to say i love you, you step back and wonder how the hell you pulled off this shit. how the hell you garnered this and  say hell yeah!   :)  hm...so i had a point to this but then i got side-tracked? i'm leaving, and it was really just to say, i'm doing pretty okay and don't worry about me. what with living with two very sexy (ow!ow!) boys as house mates, a city filled with a million sinful pleasures and an itinerary that looks like it should be on mtv, along with the crazy, definitely trouble-making, people i'm going with...this should be interesting.   take care all, i love you, and if i die half-way...remember to kiss my ass when they bury me.   heh.   "smart ass".

      he played a song the other night that seemed so ironically perfect and melancholically on the dot to how i felt. it was strange..then he read me my posts, he said like how he reads them when he's alone, tinkering on the computer..scanning my thoughts. i let teardrops fall and swallowed pride, it seemed so right then, it seemed so altogether..the tone in which he soothed the scars, the force in which he steered my pride, the strength in which his arms held me upright. it was so gentle, so kind, so sweet...it was so real.   i was afraid, then happy, then angry, then just not very sure.   he sings me to sleep sometimes, and my thumb pressed into his, my ears to his heart and i measure our heartbeats together and tune in to the rhythm.  dup-dup.  bop.  dup-dup.  bop.  dup-dup  dup-bop. and i climb into bed and curl into his arms, let my head rest on his shoulders and let our bodies contort to a comfortable position. we make love in the middle of nothing sometimes; his fingers find me and i help him fill that need. the need to be touched, the need to be stroked, the need to be fucked, and then again. the need to escape the demons of the night...they haven't visited awhile; will they come knocking soon?  i've never been one to have nightmares or dreams, but in the last few months they've pounded incestantly. i'm either getting killed, raped, chased or something or the other. he tries to wake me up though, when i'm squirming around only i don't realize it's a dream and it's so hard to fall back asleep after that...constantly waiting to be attacked, constantly waiting for something to creep beneath the shadows and fuck me over. fear is a very odd feeling. but anyway, i started this off to say i had one entirely different last night, very strangely odd in fact. it was about being caught up at a tcby store (i'm allergic to tcby ice-cream, and yes, you can laugh) that was shaped after a kfc fast food restraunt yet they were handing out mc donald's food. and the manager, this malay guy (malay guy?! ) that sorta looked like someone you'd pass by in a crowd yet there was something in his eyes that sorta made you stop, and wonder, was telling me about milkshakes and how i shouldn't order the chocolate milkshake and definitely not the special because the potatoes were bad.   what the hell?  it's vivid, stuck in my mind in a very strange way. so god awfully weird but then again, what's new eh?  madonna, puck, sexy pants and i are tkaing a trip down to orlando next week and spending a couple of days there. it's of utter importance that we analyze the details now. barker's talking about going to missouri, and then i leave for la on the 28. the parents want me to go down to virginia for a visit and hang out with the family, we'll see. there's too much on my plate to figure out silly things like this now, i'd much rather not give a care frankly. take it as it comes eh? live for the moment.   the one trip though that i'm extremely looking forward to is a certain one that flies me into kuala lumpur.  hm.  oh, and just because you counted, three months, four days was it? and still counting.   interesting.   let's play with fire.

       urlLink  "A lot of times I look at this page and wonder musingly if this is the last post I'm going to make. If things will just sort of fade away and people will forget that I've kept journals. I wonder to myself if the visitors will stop visiting and one day I'll come here and see old words and my thoughts will echo in the emtiness that is the web. I'll look around and see myself alone, and maybe I'll have the courage to really say a couple of things that have been on my mind.  But most of the times I come here hoping to vent. Hoping to let tired thoughts escape my weary mind and instead dribble flows from the tips of my fingers and I spray out so many syllables with not one little ounce of feeling behind it.  A lot of times I think this is simply because I spend so much time these days feeling things. Things I never thought I'd feel. Things I was both afraid of feeling and didn't think there were any nerves left to soak it all up.  I guess honestly my past has never been very guarded from anyone who's ever really paid any attention. The fact that it left any scars is the last thing anyone would be surprised to hear. The daily fairy tale is a shock, and yet is a ray of light and hope in a life I'd of been happy to give up on so many times during so many years.  I can't convey how weird it is, to wake up groggy next to a warm loving body next to me. For a heavy arm to fling itself across my chest and flesh press into my flesh and be joyous. The heaven of being able to feel the wonder of skin against skin, for that waft of morning breath to drift across my nostrils and for my body to sigh in releif and drink in the little stink happy that it's even there. Okay so even the best parts of life have stench, but to be joyful about it is something I am happy with.  The saddness is still there though. I am surrounded by love, and still the saddness clings to me like dirt that cannot be washed away at times. I remember the hard times, although now they are faded as they never have been. Remembering how hard it was growing up in a home where love was a rumor and happiness was dubious at best and assuredly fleeting.  I find myself wallowing this week. I go through the motions but it is a definite effort and I can't quite explain why. It makes me thankful of the arms that hold me though the nights and the dreams I can't quite escape. Strong loving arms, that I only hope feel the love I have for them.  In the mornings I face a stranger in the mirror. I'm not sure who this person is. She goes with me everywhere though, and it's odd to know that this is the only person a lot of people here know. My reflection gazes back at me unflinchingly, the face somewhat familiar, hard in places and soft in others. And the eyes stare back at me and occasionally I look at them as if looking at a strangers eyes and wonder what those eyes have seen. But then they peer knowingly at me and I remember. I remember all the things those strange sad eyes have seen.  Mostly though, my eyes stare back wearily. I wonder when I'll give up all these ghosts. I wonder when I'll get past the scars. I wonder when I'll be happy inside my skin. I wonder when I'll be content. I wonder if my particular slice of heaven has a time limit. And then I wonder if my heaven might someday blow away like so much dust in the wind.  Then my eyes meet my reflection and I stand taller, straighter, and I look like stone and my thoughts fall out of my head as if rehearsed. If all I have is a moment, I'm going to try to live in it. I'm going to try to stay in that moment. I'm going to suck every ounce of juice out of the moment as if I were dying of thirst in the middle of an arid desert. And if my moment does end...maybe the moment will sustain me though whatever comes next. This is what I tell myself. This is what I want to beleive to be true.  This is what I think before I drift off to sleep."    hm..so i suppose these are only a month late but hey!   lol, in any case, drew better start getting his ass to work...if only because as retarded as this might seem, i actually missed that bullshit. heh, so yeah, here they are.:P  they're a little silly and i've put on weight (oh my god!) but oh well, shit happens eh?                                                                                                             chicken dissing bitch!  :P

       something feels wrong...i don't know what it is. i feel so unbalanced at the moment, like i'm crashing and falling and i'm afraid to look down. i'm scared i think, or something. nervous maybe, i dont' know. i don't know what started it, i don't know why i suddenly just felt so icky, so hopeless, so bloody disgusted with myself. is this right? i didn't think so either, and i am so dman frustrated of dealing with shti like this. i'm so tired of being tired, so sick of all the bullshit and drama and up and downs, highs and lows. ever feel like this? ever feel like you've fallen off a cliff and the best thing being you don't even know why? or who pushed you? or if you slipped or if it's just a horrible dream. is this paranoia? is this mania? is this just part of being me?   i'm crazy, i swear i am. i look at myself in the mirror sometimes and wonder, what the hell did my parents do to deserve this? why the hell am i here? and i think about all the things i wish i had done, i think about all the things i could have done, should have done, must have done. i think about everything and i will myself to cry because i am so numb. i am numb to a point that i am afraid, afraid i've lost all sense of sensibility, afraid i've lost all sense of hope. what is hope? is hope the thing you hang yourself on, the tiny piece of thread you walk on? i am home. what the fuck is home. i don't know this place, sure, i know these people and the backroads and a little bit of everything but this isn't me anymore. i feel like a stranger to my ownself, i feel so lost and fucked and ugly and bastardy. there's just so much pressure, so much damn pressure to be perfect, to be right, to be okay, to be nice, to be of a certain conduct, to be of a certain person i am not. i am not her...i've never been her. it isn't me. i am just this sorry excuse i've layered. i am a product of bullshit. leave me alone i sometimes want to yell, but i'm afriad of being alone. just like i'm afraid of the dark. but i am so claustrophobic at the same time....too near. too close. too fucking bloody close for comfort.   and so i hide. suicidal, bullimic, deppresive, manic, insane, retarded, fucked. i throw up till i bleed, it's funny how that scares and soothes me at the same time. i want to leave but i cannot go, i have too many commitments, too many lives hanging on me, too many people depending on me to be around, too many hearts i cannot let down but what about me? can i please be selfish too? can i please just hide away from this a while, can i not be here for this second, this minute..just a while? it hurts. i hurt. and not at all. i am just flying. and soaring. and falling. and crashing. ....only that things are so perfect; just exactly like they should be. i am everything and i am on the way to bigger better greater amazing things because i am this amazing person. or something that goes like that anyway. it's called the extremes. i hate the extremes. i hate it with a passion so great i'd do anything to get rid of it, sometimes i think even dying. sometimes i think to rest in peace would be nice. sometimes i slap myself silly because i am silly. i have a great laugh, a nice smile too. have you ever seen it? i don't know where it goes when i get all ugly like this, i whisper to the silence and beg it not to take me, i will the emptiness into insomnia. cripple myself with exhaustion but the body can only take so much. so many doctors to see sometimes, so many things to accomplish, so many things to do. so much expected...and i must want these things but sometimes i feel like i'm on life-support. a useless limb kept alive by the people around me. ever feel like that? like i'm just wavering in between.  i am nineteen this year. almost an adult, and in some countries...already one. i feel like a complete utter bloody failure. sometimes i think, sure yeah, i'll make it. i'll be all the things i'm supposed to be, all the stuff i'm expected to be but some part feels so sure that i'll always be caged up, locked into an existence like this. it's always going to be drama and something is always going to hit one after the other after the other. it's perverse but sometimes i think it's good to get cancer. that way i can slip out and no one would be too angry. it's stupid. i should be slammed hard on my head for saying that...i don't know. maybe i'm just tired, it's 2:42 in the morning after all, i am out of ciggarettes, i am anything but driving on the wrong side of the road tonight and it is fucking freezing in this musuem. i am cold, i am stripped but layered and i am going crazy.

       something's wrong..i don't know what it is. perhaps it's intuition or plain racheal paranoia but something feels off. unbalanced.   it's eight minutes after two and my nerves are twitching, my mind going at too many million miles an hour and insomnia hits hard. mania too. i've chain-smoked through a packet, taken a cold shower, freezed my ass off, worked out, thrown up, written, organized, cooked, eaten, cried, talked but nothing feels right. nothing feels okay or anything right now..and i am scared.   i'm scared because everything's fantastic at the moment....then why the panic attack? why this feeling like i'm hyperventilating and drowning at the same time? why the feeling like i'm falling and i'm useles, ugly and disgusting. i feel hopeless at the moment...terribly dissappointed; but i don't know what caused it. i don't know why i'm going insane in my mind, i don't know why the sirens keep on going off in my head. am i going crazy? or am i already mad?  just a little going on inside;  i am a sorry excuse for a human being. i feel overweight, obese and disgusting at the moment. i don't know what it is, but it gets harder and harder to wake up in the mornings...much worst to go out. it's hard because it's that feelingof failure again..the why the hell am i back here? i cannot seem to find anythign that suits me, soothes me. there's something about the pressure, there's something abotu having to dress up, to be perfect, to have the clothes, bag, make-up, belt, earrings, shoes and god knows what else fit perfectly into the picture. i'm in this rut again, this cycle...and it's destructive. and i'm destructing.   i'm tearing apart everything i've worked on for the last couple of months. i think about what if i was stronger. what if i was thinner. what if i was more complete. what if i was better, smarter, prettier, nicer..whatever. sometimes it feels as if i am never enough, sometimes as if i am never going to be enough. know what i mean?  i am a sorry excuse.   i am a fuck hole living.   i am a pointless piece of retarded shit.   i am a waste of space.   i don't know what else i am but at this moment, i am icky. i am sad.   i don't know what's wrong.

      she wills me to speak, to say something. to utter meaning behind this destructive, once-protective barrier. she pierces blue-green eyes to mine that trickles out painful drops of betrayal....why, how, when, what? she wants to know, she begs to know.  i can only look the other way.  i can only toughen up, shut up, walk away.   write;  six million entries of prose and poetry...seven million anguished thoughts. did i mean it? was i dreaming? is this another one of those 'lessons' you file in that great big storybook of life and flip back to reminince once in a while, to recreate all the drama to know you still feel, to pierce a little, stab, scratch the surface and sting?  it doesn't seem to work that way anymore...it's sad, perhaps a little ironic yet comforting at the same time.   a void filled. a place taken. a story ended.   what is this desire? what is this trust? what is this obsession?  with love? with trust? with commitment?  taking in hard fought battles, old, trite, boring...so fucking repetitive. so damn redundant, i am amused. laughs...cackles a while. a bloody big joke, a huge facade of shadows, a constant change of securities.   they say admit her. she says no....let me think about it.   she distracts.   shopping, alienation, socializing. coffee, charity do's, airline tickets and holidays. make me beautiful; her splendid array of animal coated products at her dispense, money. money. money.   what the hell does this shit prove anyway?  a hundred here. a thousand there. a couple of quids in between, pounds? aussie? ringgit?  a ball kicked through different holes, a specific amount. a random card chosen, a tarot flipped. choose your destiny, decide your future...this power. this surge of control. building up an itinerary...irony hits like a steel brick shoved up the ass.   talking to three travel agents, mastering online purchasing, sucking at connections, and liabilities. fly this for that for something or another.   three weeks later and the crave for independence begins again. i'll walk, i'll drive, i'll pay, i'll plan, i'll take care of myself, i'll be fine, i want to be left alone.

      she's screaming cause it's a quarter after midnight on a friday night and we're spent lazing on the couches watching shit satellite, playing a rather tacky game of mah-jong and sitting in our knickers over a pint of fucking delicious green tea ice-cream. the kind that melts just right in your mouth and enters your fucking system so damn smoothly it's like making love in chocolate syrup.   and the great thing is; we could very well perfectly be down at liquid or nouvo someplace in skimpy litte outfits with makeup and hair done just right partying to the latest dang gweiloh dj flown down, getting absolutely knackered and driving off in our little cars, talking on our little cellphones then picking up a one night stand, meeting the person of our dreams, or coming home to each other in the secluded security fucked, cops crawling, balisque shit of a hideaway we have and make love. but instead, we've chosen this. is it right? is this real? is this what i want?  yet ashes lie scattered over the newly purchased home bloody-rip-off depot coffee table from an equally useless but so goddamn gorgeous ashtray. her eyelids flutter and her doeful innocent yet naughty seductive bullshit eyes pierce into my soul and commands my every thought, my every pore, my every decision. goddamnit, three weeks home and we've started up this old horse again. hm.   but seven days ago she lay nursing me, three days ago she rubbed my back as i prayed to the porcelain gods, last night she wiped my tears spent from agonizing over medical drama and every morning, then noon, and night, she counts out the pills, lays them out, and chokes me down with them. is it that possible to hate and love someone at the same time?   she says run away with me. she says stay. she says lets have fun.   i just listen.   and sometimes i answer....sometimes i don't.  sometimes i raise my voice too loud and end up screaming.   sometimes i think things too deep and get emotional, curling into a ball of tears.   yet sometimes, i am in absolute peace. i am gracious and smiling, patient and understanding.   sometimes, i am forgiving.   it is rare, but sometimes, i am a gem. a not quite completely honed, brilliantly cut yet in need of a polish exquisite rock. diamond sometimes, ruby, sapphire, opal....anything that crosses my mind at that moment. any smile that washes over my face in that instant.   there are times i am beautiful, and these are the times i am grateful because love makes me beautiful.   ......i accidently stumbled across the old website we used to keep together today. a little after i read his mail, i didn't quite expect new posts, heck, i didn't even expect mail. but there it was, a two page letter, some photographs, and kisses in an envelope. so full of expectations, so full of hope, so full of things i am not sure of.   i read through the last few things you wrote, they were dedicated to me. i should be honored....i am honored. this is love, but love is a challenge...is love enough?   i think about the last couple of months...approaching six now, and i think what bliss, what a nightmare, what a fucking adventure. i think about waking up to you and falling asleep in your arms. i think about having you move in me, and the gentle way you kiss me from head to toe, the funny way you whisper even when we have the whole house to ourselves. the way you come in me and your lips kinda part....or the way you feel so hungry when you reach to grab me at the end of the day.   i think about sending you off and you waiting for me. i remember the way your face looked so sad and so happy for me, the roses just right and the music that always played even when we were fighting. i dance again alone remembering the way you keep me safe in your arms and move to the music with me.   i remember the passion in your eyes, and the standoffish almost arrogant attitude you sometimes give, the ways you know or the ways you think you know. and i've learn about giving and taking but i know that there are many more lessons ahead.   i know your soothing voice as i go through three minutes in hell. the one that says you'd like to be the father of my kids, the one that says it's okay, the one that says we'll take it one day at a time.   i also know the voice that agrees even if my argument is patetically weak. and i wonder what this break for summer is all truly about. did i need time away or did you already sense me pushing. is it like she says and makes a mockery of me for; am i that shitty at commitment? am i so pissingly afraid?  i say i need time. you say how much. i say i cannot. you say you don't know. i say things are brilliantly better off this way. i'll see you in three months and we'll see how things go from there. from where you say. will i fall in love? will i stay? will i come home?   i am in love.   i'm staying for the rest of the trip.   and yes, i am coming home.   summer is our excuse for sin....and hand-written letters make me smile. and i smiled nice, huge and big today.   what the fuck is life all truly about? good question bozo, i wish i had all the answers for you sometimes. maybe i'll make the perfect wife, the perfect mother...maybe. you never know. shit, we never knew this would last as long as it has, as deep as this. i take out paper to write you a reply but i am so goddamn distracted, so many things to say....everything and nothing to show you.   flights, tickets, we always seem to do this halfway thing. no tahiti this year but i suppose the elephants would do eh?  this feels so fucking strange. almost surreal.   just in what in the hell am i doing?  just exactly which game is this?  i am bombfucked.   i am loved.   i am me.

      it's a quarter after midnight and i've tossed out enough of shit to drag my lazy ass to sit down and blog. blog something good i tell myself..write something real, something that has meaning, something that's honest, and kind, and true.....about yourself.   let's see; i am...  this gets a little hard doesn't it?  it's been hard to look at myself in the mirror the last couple of days. i can't quite explain it, no, it isn't the dozens of photos that stare back at me with steely eyes that irk me the most...i think it is the subtle pounding into my conscience that screams out you fucking double crossed bastard liar. you bloody good actress you. it is the acceptance that lead great double lives, sometimes even three.   the me inside, the one that cries, that hurts, that's for most part, an irreravant piece of clumsy shit.  the me outside, the smiling, amazing, popular, wonderful lifed bitch.  then the me in here, the chain smoking, foul mouthed, unbalanced, manic, depressed, bullimic, suicidal, retarded, silly little whore that pleases herself in churning out sentences that brings her closer to herself. closer to being real she says, closer to bringing the inner and outer together.   he says you're beautiful.  she says believe that and you're the dumbest girl on earth.  he says you're amazing.  she cackles and her laughs ring in your ears.   he says so many things but she knows all the counter attacks.   what are you really racheal? what are you made of? where do you belong? what is your ancestory? how does fame and glamor or whatever the hell you do the whole damn day mask the inner you? how the fuck do you hide the millions of skeletons in your closet? what makes you think you're truly worth anything, and of all things, what makes you think you're worth love?  because they think so damnit. because i know so.   right?  you are one fucking fruitcake racheal.   welcome to my world bitch.

      it's a little bit obscene at the moment. actually, fuck that, it's insanely obscene...  a little constrictive, a little daring, a little avant-garde meets my grandmother.   i am very amaused and very disenchanted by it all, a little jaded, a little naiive, a little insecure. i'm not sure exactly...hm.   what are six words i would choose to describe it all?   uhm. beats me.   i'm getting a little tired of this really, all the writing gets a little annoying, and so i think along with the holiday i might fill the empty lots with further more productive things than sit and bitch about my life eh? or not.   you never know, i might return after summer with a tan, a definite bet of a million stories to tell and an engagement ring or two. at the rate shit's going right now...this summer is heck of shit going to be interesting. :)  the pixie's are calling...excuse me now.

      lol, it's only about a quarter after six in the morning and i am WIDE AWAKE. being horribly jet lagged is an awful, awful thing, especially when you're knocked out by six in the evening and by noon you're ready to kill someone or just drop dead. in any case..being back home has been amazing!!  i've been on a reading rampage from all the books i brought back from la and i still haven't gotten through it all! the manuscript is coming up along fine and we've been working on it some. it's funny to relive so many stories and yet be so emotionally involved in a draft...very weird.  but a good kind of weird.  :P  hmm...the last three days have just been a constant flow of people, alcohol and shopping! lol, i've been meeting up with friends from my high school, friends from nowhere, friends from work and friends from every bloody place. it's retarded because i feel like a broken tape recorder saying the same things, showing the same pictures, telling the same stories again and again and again. it's fun though!!!   that  ex also proposed to me two nights ago.   i think i will leave it at that.   ...or maybe explore it later but yeah, suffice to say, i was shocked, honored, livid, pissed, irritated, and bored. it was funny, fucking hillarious from another world. the guys got a good kick out of it though...:P   and yes, i did say no thank you though a slap across the face might have done a better trick. in some odd sense i was floating in another world as he told me bullshit about waiting for me, me being the one, you're the only one that has ever mattered blah blah blah and the only thing that crossed my mind was oh really? and too fucking late. and you don't know me and neither do i know you and i'm not quite sure if we should do that either. in any case, he's convinced that actions speak louder than words and that i just need a little persuasion. i was too hungover, jet-lagged, tired, and frustrated to tell him about the other half of the story and where i stood. i suppose i will though, eventually. we'll see.   you see, it isn't that i don't give a fuck about our friendship and all that good stuff but that i don't get sparks or romantic notions and all that jazz when i see him anymore. my heart doesn't beat faster, my palms don't get sweaty but rather my mind sorta wanders around and that i finally see him for everything he is. flaws and all. and it isn't very nice of me to say but shit, i got fooled a long while didn't i? no doubt knowing someone for five years is a long, long time...and i know i've grown with him, loved him, and all that but that moment has just passed and i don't want to return to it. if only because, or most of all, i'm not the same person anymore.   back onto nicer things though....FOOD! fucking food. holy bloody mother of god, it's been a succession of food, food and more food since i've arrived. that whole thing about malaysian's and their food? hell bloody true.   and OH MY GOD! the roads!!!! the drivers! the solution to it all, keep your attention to the screen, strap in, and pray really hard. lol, i've given myself two weeks to a month before i'm attempting to drive on the other side of the road again. good fucking luck. (thank you uncle ahmad, red and white cabs, and the swooshing trains)  hehe, want to know a funny thing? my room at home is about four times the size of my room in pensacola and so the first night, after balking at all the extra additions to the house and the brand new entertainment system in my room (thank you daddy) i absolutely did not know what to do with myself. lol, and so at four in the morning when i woke up (regardless of the fact that i only had two hours of bloody sleep, but did my body care? hell no. it woke me up anyway!) i had all this bloody space and i'm like whoa. lol.  oh, and for the first time in a lot of months, my clothes are fucking ironed, my room is clean clean clean, my bed is made, and i have breakfast, lunch, dinner, tea, and supper prepared! hell yeah, this is the life. lol.   oh and btw, because i promised a mention, drew is the most amazing, wonderful, gorgeous, talented, whore master in the whole entire world.         (or so he claims.)   :P  ooh, and closet space!!! hehe, i have this tiny little white closet in pensacola that when opened, bursts out with six million things that aim straight for the most painful places to hit or smother you and back here i have a walk in and it is brilliant! clean, neat, categorized and all nice and pretty.   hehe. nick said the other day, oh my god you're one happy bitch. and i am!!! it's crazy. i got off the plane and i'm like asian people! asian people! my cousins! my grandparents! my mom! my family! yay!!!!  other than the crazy, crazy heat (we've had the airconditioning at full blast) malaysia is absobloodylutely amazing! :)  lol, and today we're going down to chinatown, which is always good, and i'm pissed excited. hehe.   of course next week also starts a whole bunch of tests and appointments to tell me how horrible i am at taking care of myself but for right now, the only thing i can say is, HAH!  i'm happy. this is good.   whoop! whoop!  talk to you later!!!  (i'm getting to the emails soon i rpomise. just requires me sitting down for a period of time that's all.)   big hugss!!!

      so i've started on what can only be deemed as the ultimate life-long dream of writing my book. what the hell is it about? a memoir? the first hand look from the fuck up girls mind? a sad  modest  desire in me to see my name in print...or just the longer, printed out, mass marketly available version of my blog? i'm not sure exactly..but a couple of days at the book convention thronged with six million publishers, editors, authors and people trying to convince you that writing is the ultimate thing might do that to you.   or not.   we'll see. :P  how's la been, everyone seems to ask?  or at least all 368k of you that took up my inbox space that hotmail threatened to kick my ass and stick needles up me.   it's fine. it's beautiful. it's sinfully amazing.   i've spent more hours in the sun, basking in the glow of very deliciously tanned boys from god knows where and from every corner of the earth..getting in line with everyone and their mother's being sucked into fucking great marketing from the people at universal, rediscovering my love for mickey, the anaheim ducks and bloody basketball and every damn news coverage of the downtown la area and back plus getting to know the bellboys, the housekeepers and the man that stocks up the mini bar daily very well. life is beautiful and things do seem to be getting better for the most part.  i take these long walks late at night after the partying is over and everyone's returned back into their rooms...and i walk these streets and streets that seem so ancient and so emcompassing at the same time. i take a million pictures of the beggars lining up the streets and the drunks returning from a good night out with feathery boas and weird dress sense and make friends with the new faces from different parts of the world all here on holiday or for the book convention. it's quite strange really.  i've been to quite a few of these things growing up. my dad's business things but suddenly i am eighteen, sorta kinda grown up now and put into a different light. i meet these publishers that have seen me grow up and i run into their arms for the great big hug and i feel secure. papa rold especially and he shows me his cellphone and how my names imbedded in there and it's wonderful. like coming home really.  and me dad. god, where do i even begin? i cried and bawled like a little child when i met him off the plane at lax. he'd flown in from narita and here i was, 6 hours later from pensacola, tired of the plane and fucking anxious to see him and i just burst out crying. i swore i wouldn't do it and even as i said good bye to the other parents, amanda and keith...walking in to board my plane and all that good shit i was still doing fine. laughing, making stupid jokes, tinkering around and being silly....but then i saw my dad and suddenly i felt so many things and it was as if some switch in me had turned on or turned off rather and i was my dad's little spoiled princess child again and i didn['t need to be in self-protection bitch mode because i was home. and safe. because it was that feeling of being loved for whoever i was, whatever i'd become and whoever i was going to be. it was a good feeling really and i've missed my dad and it's funny how much you realize what love truly is and means.   there's been so many little things in the past few days that have just sorta taken me aback and made me so thankful for my family. from the little surprise package my mom sent with my father to the gentle caring glow that reflects in their eyes. the way he sorta boasts and tlaks about me to his friends/business people and the way i know he's proud of me and i can be a cocain crack homeless absolutely useless addict shithead and he'll still find something to love. that just amazes the hell out of me and i am blessed. truly.   i tlaked to jared the other night too and it was odd. there's a lot to be said about the ups and downs i've been through in the last few months but i feel sorta grown up yet naiive in some way now. some part of me is so ready to conquer the world, live out my life to the fullest extent i can live it too and yet at the same time i'm sorta chilling and taking things one thing at a time. it's weird.   my brother's going to balk at this but here i go again tlaking about change as i move on into a high. bloody manic depressive freak. :P  some little part in me is beginning to believe in myself...it's as if these last few days i've seen all these people believe in me and seen how i am someone in someonelse's life and it's weird. i don't know.  i'm also a little worried about ryan at the moment but i suppose i'll ring up jessica tomorrow. i'll be home in less than a week and that's a crazy crazy feeling.   wow.   i've also clocked in at least 200 laps in the last few days at the pool so that's kinda cool too. my bullimia is somewhat under control but it's still somewhere there but you know, you take it one step at a time eh? i don't know, but i'll be right...:)  hm. i need to get back to writing the damn thing and sending out some postcards so i suppose i'll talk to you guys later.   i love you and take care okay?  i miss you!

      it's about a quarter to two on a tuesday evening, rather early to be blogging but nonetheless, a typical melodramatic racheal post.   i've just read random bits and pieces of 'prozac nation', a gift from my father that i found laying outside my door sunday morning. pretty damn cool, i must say. the bastards at amazon ran out of stock so this gift from my dad is very special. in a million ways he will probably not know.   i have cold honey lemon tea sitting by my bed side, frankly, i am more interested in the pack of cigarettes that lay untouched stashed away in my drawers. i am trying to get rid of this nasty cold and all the gunk in my throat, i need to go in for shots sometime this week that they won't give to me until my immune system is up.   i also leave in two weeks, ten days short of when i had been expecting to go.   and once again, i still don't know how i feel exactly.   saw the head doctor today, dragged my ass downtown and she readjusted my medication again. it must have been the suicidal bitch in me that raised alarms....but who gives a hoot anyway? i am such a piss ass whiner  sometimes.    i have this strange habit of underlining phrases and writing on the sides of the books that i am reading. i date them too..and so i sit with a couple of yellow and black lined 2b pencils and a sharpener with a box of tissues and an afgan to crawl into. the thermostat is at some obscene temparature but the thought of moving across the room just seems like too much effort.   i read through quotes and poetry that my distorted self-destructive mind seemed to have penned in the last 48 hours. i didn't sleep for 36 hours yesterday, some manic insomniac phase taking over and the need to just be doing something seemed so much important. so many things to do with my life, so fucking little time. i must be going crazy, i am crazy. fuck me. fuck me. fuck me.   as i think about barker's hands slipping beneath the covers at night or spooning close with bare skin on bare skin and the surrounding beauty in the simplicity of being naked. i, the person that can only make love in the dark, that hates looking in the mirror, that throws up and starves herself, is okay. is safe.  or about him moving deep in me..making love to this broken body and tattered soul, the gentle soothing way listening to his heart thump against my ear drifts me off to sleep as he whispers in the middle of the night or hums along to whatever we have playing on cd.  i think about how amazing it feels to have someone to come home to, and how lucky i feel.   i am such a wanker to be feeling so sorry for myself, get me out of this rut. get me out of this whole. get me out of this bitch of a state.   and memories locked in some sacred haven comes tumbling down as i remember.   i remember going to the show with my brother last year. watching sophie ellis-baxter slink her way through and let her powerful beats move through my body. or that horrible flourescent lighted, rat infested, dark back alley mamak glory lane we went to after that. taking the tube with koko and catching up on life. on london and of all things, trying to soak in the comfort of being the little sister again. a different relationship now, it's changed. i kinda like it.   or the three in the morning sprees back in florida at wal*mart. and the alltel babe that we always manage to somehow con with amanda's boobs. i do have a great calling plan though, boobies do serve their purporse sometimes. :P  i remember mark from boston, as we snacked on ramen noodles and binged on snicker bars from the pantry. of taking off and landing, of twenty sum hours in between and nestled between our parents and movies. of being stuck in a plane for way too long, travel scrabble and air hostesses with oddly colored suits and funky smelling toiletries or the odd way strangers connect on a long flight back home.   or the new friends i have met, and how insecure i feel about me sometimes.   i remember the death sentence. and the caving of your insides as you try and breath and calm the fuck down.   or right after the surgery when my face was so bloated up and how fucking damn ugly i felt. a shoeboxful of get well notes and memories, all locked up, all looked at from time to time....reminding myself i have to be strong. i need to be strong.  i think about the insane craves i have for scones or a cup of teh tarik. for marmite or baked beans and toast. magee mee goreng or someone to just bloody know where kuala lumpur is.  i remember, and sometimes it is hard remembering. sometimes, there are so many little details you start to forget, or leave out.   i forget the way my grandfather smells, or if akari liked that bitter kerepek thing. i forget because sometimes, all the memories hit you at once and it gets kinda displaced while sorting it out, and it's confusing.   and i am sad but happy, excited but afraid.   forgive me for the manic-depressive sorry whining bitch i have become in the last few days.   i love you all.   and i am just rambling at some hour of the morning, just to say something, just to write.   just  to   remember.      urlLink  "A whole shitload.

      the blogathon has started...i've spent the last couple of days trying to come out with a decent entry but it's been hard to say the least. i bite back the tears that make me feel so weak and insecure even as i write this, i try and come to terms with life and all that surrounds it...i suppose there is a point to it all. i suppose there will be reason and understanding beneath the layer of tranquility that i will find eventually.   i counted out pennies and quarters, spare change...wanting so desperately to make a difference. a little part of me believed that things could go on, my few dollars would make a big difference, there would be world peace. and i could save the kids. and no one else would hurt.  i sit here now, flipping through hundreds and hundreds of pages. i have an insane urge to just run from it all, the stories, the words, the pictures leave a sour bitter after taste like rotting food or bad sex. it is hard to muster how i feel or swallow the tears, but still, i keep on reading. and keep on crying. and keep on trying.   cancer scares the shit out of me.   i've said it out loud. but seven mere words don't even come close.   it is a dragon i fight with my demons. it is sanity i plead with the gods up above, the entities, whatever supreme being that rules this earth.   i am afraid. afraid of so many things, things i don't have control over at all. i am afraid of my disease, i am afraid of myself and growing up, of not knowing my place in the world and not knowing what i have to offer.   i leave in a couple of weeks. i don't exactly know how i should feel, i feel...confused. and tired. and melancolic. i feel...excited. and weary. and laughy.   i am picking up things from my life that i have left to rest a while. my theater degree, my hopes, my dreams. him. and coming home to him, and working on all that we are...wiser over the summer, realization hits like ten pound bricks; painful. but nonetheless helpful.   he says   "Hang in there baby. I need you. "   i whisper,   i need you too.   and crumble, fade alone into the darkness.  i think i'll go away a while. be by myself for a couple of days. i've been avoiding people and faces, it just seems so wrong. i feel so guilty.   i didn't take my medication on thursday or friday either. things seemed pointless and hopeless at some stage. i felt like i was cheating myself, making myself believe that i would be okay, that i would be cured, that i would be healthy just by a couple of pills.   i don't think it helped.   i spiralled so far down i don't think anyone could quite reach me.   fell.  stumble.  cried.  hurt.  scraped.  bled.   i begged god, asked if he was listening. wanting to know if he was there.   i remind myself constantly that suicide is not an option. it is never, and it will never be.   i'm just tired sometimes. i just want a break.   my throat is so sore from throwing up, but i cannot help myself. my stomach so empty, my thoughts so jumbled, my room so horribly musked up with cigarette smoke.   i am not feeling too well today. i don't know what i want. i just wish....i don't know what i wish.   i'm okay.   i'll be alright.   i'm a big girl now, i'm okay.   i just want to hide in the corner a while.   disappear.

         akari stopped treatment three months ago to go back home to indonesia. they buried her today.  unexpected? not really. i don't know. i just didn't think it'd be so soon, i just didn't think it'd really happen. i just didn't think her....her.   i don't know exactly how i feel right now.   i think i need to cry, but the tears don't come. i just remember the dreadful silence, and the caving of your insides. the be brave, smile, be strong front you put on for the other kids, and go through the routines, and make them smile, make them laugh, calor another butterfly.   she's dead.  fuck you god.   fuck you fairness.  fuck you life.   these are the times you come back home and ask just what the fuck you're doing? these are the times you come home and the only thing you really want to do is just make it all better, take the pain away, the screaming voices, the wailing children, the catatonic so fucking drugged faces out of your mind. these are the times you question, question, question why you do this, and you want to know how to be strong, and you want to know all the damn answers, and you really just want to know why?  i sit here, a blank screen before me searching for the words to somehow describe how i feel. i cannot seem to find any adjectives, and verbs, anything at all that comes even remotely close. i am so many things at once, i am, i don't know.   you get close to the kids, whether you like it or not, there are always the special ones that stick out. the ones you keep close to your heart forever, the ones that make your whole world seem so surreal with stupid bad news like this.   i sit here remembering all the different things we used to do together, how she'd cling to my waist when i left, how we'd play with wigs and hats, or color and color and color. she made this origami thing of 180 folded pieces with her mom for me before i left last year and gave it to me for my going away party. it was for luck she said, it was for good wishes, and dreams.   she is still seven. and she will never be eight.  and she will never be all the things she fought so fucking hard for.   what the fuck is wrong with this world?  what the fuck is wrong with this whole bloody shit of a system life that we have?  i just want to know why.  i just want to know how.  i just want to know.  she still has big grown up prom dresses to pick, first crushes to kiss, ambitions to fill, barbie dolls to play.   i want to live in denial for a while and pretend this isn't happening, but i cannot. but it's real. but she's gone.   you try and get the sick nauseating smell of the hospital out of your mind, fresh in your memory. or the sores, or the patches of hair falling off, or the horrible horrible nightmares.   akari died today.   why?  what do you say to someone who's just lost their only daughter?      ---   i'm okay, don't worry about me. if you believe in god, pray for her okay? and her parents...she has two other older brothers and her mom is expecting. it's too early to tell if it will be a girl or boy, maybe that was akari's last gift to her parents.   thank you so much for all the kind words. for some odd reason, i couldn't cry yesterday. i think my medication does that, but tonight, tonight i had a good cry. and i wanted to thank all of you for being there, for all the comforting, reassuring, calm words. i don't think you'll ever know just how much it means. thank you. terima kasih. xie-xie. nandri. danke sehr. arigato.   i went on a rampant search for pictures of us together last night too. and it was good to remember her smiling, i still don't know why crap like this happens but maybe there is a reason, i don't know. thank you all again.   thank you to the  urlLink bloggers blogging for cancer  too. for providing hope and filling up the void.   hugs.  you guys be safe and take care.   i'll be (al)right.  don't worry.    p/s remember to tell someone you love them today okay?

      lunch with the ex-girlfriend.   urlLink   "And it hurts me To look into the mirror at myself And it hurts even more To have to be with somebody else And it's so hard to do And so easy to say But sometimes Sometimes you just have to walk away"    the morning sun blazes it's way through the afternoon, and the single solitary tear from god cascades into a kaleidoscopic ray of colors; a gorgeous rainbow that spreads throughout the valley...we light up watching the magnificence of mother earth and humanity.    "is it okay if i hold your hand?"    i lace mine with yours, assuring you.   of course it's okay.    urlLink  they  wail into an ironic apt afternoon.   "Running in circles Chasing tails And coming back as we are  Nobody said it was easy Oh it's such a shame for us to part Nobody said it was easy No one ever said it would be so hard"    an almost endless stream of silence and conversation. the little old man at the table beside us enjoying his scoop of ice-cream, glee in his eyes and his quiet, patient, loving wife, with her metallic hair pushing his wheelchair as if holding on to his hand.    "i want to grow old with you."   ouch.   the restaurant rings with us in the air. the ambiance so serene, peacefully calm and tranquil in so many ways....maybe it is the waterfall behind us, and the gentle gushing sounds. or perhaps it is the lighted candles: of different sizes, of different colors, of different scents to intrigue our minds. fresh orchids in clear crystal vases,  lips on bare naked skin, rays of light piercing through the windows, clouds of smoke surrounding, misting us.   it's ending.   i'll miss you, i whisper into the air and everything that surrounds you. afraid to look you in the eye, afraid i will cry and it will never stop. afraid my heart and yours will break with letting go, smiling. you're so gorgeous, so amazing in so many indescribable ways and i cling on to you as if i could cling on to you forever. holding you close, stroking your hair, listening to your heart beat against mine and kissing your tears away....almost too desperately begging you not to break down. it's tough, and i giggle into your ears, and you listen to my heart.    "you smell so, so, so familiar."    i love you.     urlLink  "Reached out and caught you.   Yes, I want all that.  With you."      urlLink  "Here I am. Yes, I'm still here."

       urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink     she slips away into the dark at the break of dawn, catches the sunrise just as the day breaks and she's flying out of the city into the mountains. to look for peace she says, to relish in solitude a while, to disconnect from the outer world, the people around her, to be alone with her demons a while and maybe contemplate on life a little. or the quality of it rather.   she doesn't pack too much; her time-worn tattered precious journal of too many years and too many stories, a flask of hot coffee, a couple cans of diet soda, some fruit and an armfull of cds and mds. a little bit of krall and sondhiem, a little bit of dashboard and sheik, a shitload of sp,marvelous three and sigur ros. heck, she even threw in disney just for good measure and a whole lot of self-made, friend-made, compilations.   it's the crack of dawn and she fills up the tank to go up the windy roads. she hasn't driven in a while, but i suppose she needs the driving therapy this weekend. she goes in to see the head doctor again tomorrow so it is only a day trip, slightly less than eighteen hours. and as she stops at the gas station, she catches the most amazing sunrise she's seen in the last couple of days, weeks even. away from the city and nestled in the valley, she sits and cries her silent tears. meditates, prays, smokes her cigarettes, steps on the gas, passes by cars and cars of happy children, excited students, vacationing families.   it's cold as fuck up there. misty, foggy and chilly too, but she loves it.   layered and bundled up she checks into the hotel and has tea with scones. so bloody very english it almost makes her laugh. and so she does, she giggles to herself, hums, the smiles return after a while. the rainbow comes after the rain, the clouds clear up, the thoughts decipher themselves and make sense somehow.   she had a strangely disconnected saturday. from waking up to falling asleep. pretending, smiling, laughing, hiding. don't show your tears, disguise your pain, disconnect.   she listened to them sing, screamed i will survive, and had seven thousand and sixty two messages come in from her. the questioning still continued, and as night fell, she watched the ex-girlfriend break down.   sometimes i don't know if being tough, and strong is all at all worth it? it drew blood last night, to see her cry, to see her confusion, to listen to her....to consciously feel her falling and losing grip on her fingers. but i couldn't give her the answers she needed to hear, i couldn't be the person she needed me to be, i am not the person she needs me to be.   i kissed her, as if it would make things better. i held her hand and held her tight, a part of me never wanting to let go, another knowing i had to walk away. it was surreal almost, something i would definitely not have guessed at all...the roles have fucked themselves over and changed again.   i hurt her.   she shed her ms tough girl act.   i walked away.   i tossed and turned the whole night trying to justify my actions. wanting so badly to reply her messages, wanting so badly to tell her it'd all be okay but consciously, or subconsciously, or whatever the hell it was, i knew it wouldn't happen. it couldn't happen.   and so in the aloneless today, i found myself again. taking away all the emotions and drama, taking away all the comforts and dealing with the brutal truth. i love her too much to do this, i love her too much to have us hurt that crazily much again.   and barker laughs at the irony of it all. ina came to jersey this weekend, we had a long conversation when i got back. about things that had happened, about things that were happening, about the future, about our pasts, about the currents and the current.   this summer has been so strange i'm not quite sure how to even start organizing it in my mind frame.   but for now, there are post-it notes.  --- thank you callista, grace, irene, hani and ash for listening to me croak and singing so beautifully. you made certain parts of the weekend bearable and meesh, you are beautiful and loved, don't ever let anybody take that away from you.   the other kl bloggers and the gender genes group, for making kuala lumpur so special to me and opening up a whole new world.   big two, for talking some sense into me, for conversations, for your amazing voice, i hope it all works out for you. for looking out for me, thank you always.  chris, linux and cake, lime ice-cream, drama, drama, drama, bitching. fix your bloody site!  sloppy,  i love you no matter what happens, no matter where we end up, no matter where we go from here. you will always, always be a special someone to me, and thank you for the lessons. the road forks and we carry our angels eh? take care of yourself bimbo, you mean the world.   puck, recieved the hand-written long notes in the mail yesterday. thank you for the emails, the blasted phone bills, the long drive to the postoffice and sexypant's update. see you in three weeks!  old man, i hope you're doing fine. i know it's been a tough couple of months for you but hang in there okay? we all love you and i miss you much. hope the eye is healing up and the smiles are returning.  babe, i miss you too and i think we both knew going into this that it'd be hard. too many skeletons in our closets, too much going on, too many emotions and feelings and all that good stuff. thank you for believing in me, trusting me, loving me, and whatever happens, happens i suppose? expectations smanzy, we'll do our polka dotted tango together when i get back and finally shoot the fucking movie eh?  koko, i can't wait to see you and no, you can't have my prozac. i love you silly dinky and thank you for letting me share this side of me with you and not bursting the bubble. have fun with the prada and the gucci.    ---   and so, even if i, the fat lady, sang yesterday...it still ain't over yet.   :)    urlLink  "This site.  This journal.  This niche.  This is the mirror of my stupidity; the reckless life of a youth and the irony of my maturity and naiveness."      urlLink  "I find myself looking forward to tomorrow."      urlLink  "So here are my feelings. In black and white. For the entire internet world to see. A fountain of emotions, thoughts, wishes, and feelings. Wrapped up in one blog with mistakes and holes everywhere. I could do this for hours and hours and hours.   Something's right."      urlLink  "..... then, everything falls into place perfectly.  And she lived happily ever after."

       urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink     i wrote one long ass-humping entry last night sobering up but in which i brilliantly screwed myself over and somehow managed to delete. i swear my stupidness amazes me sometimes.   --  i accidentally ran into her last night. actually, i take that back, i ran into Her last night. Her that denotes a big fat capital fucking h, her that started the whole ball rolling of gender issues, and crossing the lines, and questioning sexuality. her that brought me into a different realm, the other side, so to say, equally her that means so much in such a little way. or not. i'll tell you when i figure that one out.   i was not prepared to meet her, to say the least. we were at yet another one of those five million places in kuala lumpur where they had seventeen million clubs in one place. i can't remember what exactly happened that i ended up going, despite repeated attempts of seven hundred and six excuses that went unheard.  we were tequila happy with shot after shot consumed. if i have to think about it, i suppose i stopped counting after six or seven, too busy chasing the purple monkey on the dance floor that i swear winked at me. now, as i look back at it, i know there were signs. signs all around, signs up my ass, signs spurting from the backalley and the sidewalks.   attempting to walk straight, getting picked up by strange random men, screaming, laughing, waiting for the asshole jockey who parked our cars seven thousand miles away to come back. the night seemed to be coming to an end, adjourning to birthday girl's house, moving on to the birthday suit party.  but then the phone rang. flashed.   her.   on the next street.   right   there.   and i'm not quite sure what i was thinking. i'm not sure if i screamed, or if i had a grin the size of my ass plastered on my face. or maybe it was both. i think oh fuck, shit, hell yeah, uhm, damnit, uh-oh, and yay ran through my mind a couple of million times in those nanoseconds.   i might have ran into her arms. we might have exchanged six million words, and danced around a little. stilletto shoes and all.   we sat outside of absolut, now progressing to double shots, and talked. and exchanged words, i'm sure i slurred. i'm sure i said a lot of stupid things. i'm sure i just smiled and pretended to comprehend. i'm sure i pretended not to notice that she'd switched from malboro to salems. or that she still wore that chain. or that i could not keep my eyes off her. or that above everything, i would always be in love with her.   i know she questioned that. hell, i know last whole night was a bloody load of questioning. of trying to understand where things stood. of seeing someone you've thought of plenty and plenty of times before. of runnning again into someone you've run into a million times in your head before, and what you would say, the things you would do, the questions you would ask, the answers you would give.   i pretended not to notice when her hand touched my back as we crossed the street. or when her arms brushed past mine as my left hand and her right hand drew in breaths of our salems. our cancer sticks. or the way her lips would move, her brilliant smile. damnit, to be mesmerized by her again. to question.   and there are so many thoughts that go through my mind right now but the headache isn't exactly helping. i have three weeks left, and that's three painfully too short weeks.   humpty mouthing 'ryan?'.  birthday girl screaming, yelling, taking pictures.   ass-happy getting more ass happy and flashing thumbs-up signs and getting more sloshed.   and the rest of the other people at the house, inside. around.   and us.  and her.   and this.    i don't think i'm quite making sense at the moment, nor do i know what is going on. or how i feel. or what i want. or how she is. or if i'm fine. so i think i'll climb back into bed and nurse the hangover, raw eggs and all.   damnit.   urlLink  "Whatever causes these things, whether it be an amazingly humbling image, the vision of a heavenly creature, a moving song, a familiar scent, a stolen kiss or an unexpected smile, they're the kind of jolts that we need once in a while to remind us that we're alive."     urlLink  " But I also hope it won't be too hard to leave it all one more time to come back in the fall."

      she scribbles away in private ecstacy, of purging one's self of thoughts and voices, opinions and accusations. the immediate relief as solid black ink touches crisp white lined paper, a journal, a diary, a fuck-it-all.   wrinkled, tear-stained, yellow entries mock her. reminding her, bellowing out at her, screaming of what was yesterday, and what is today, can never quite be forgotten. she broke down in many, many pieces last night...they questioned her. they asked, prodded, begged, violated, screamed, yelled, cried, soothed, calmed, tried to understand her.   a million questions left unanswered, a cave of rotting secrets and hard-kept facades and masks exposed, violently thrown in their faces, as if daring them to accept her, as if daring them to love her. love her? the harsh, falsetto lined, cackling, mocking voice laughs at her. you're so stupid sometimes silly girl, you're so purely, insanely dumb.   she fights back, but she is tired. sick already, and so her defenses aren't quite as strong as they should be, she scratches but it is only a surface, she  pierces but only the outer layer.   she looks at swollen eyes in the mirror, bruised body from broken veins at the gym, throat sore and bleeding and a  half cracked smile wades it way through eeriely, she's okay though. she's alright. notes, poems, prose scribbled all over the books she's brought back that lies on her night stand. of thoughts and actions, of important words underlined, and someone accidentaly read it last night, and someone accidentally intruded into her private pain. i don't think they meant to, they just did.   you are so fucking morbid she tells herself. you are so fucking weird. as dreams invade her already sleep-deprived insomniac mind, the little three hours that she spends tossing and turning into a nightmarish jumble of people and faces, instances and things. she runs and runs, but there is no exit. she burns alive. she burns breathing. she burns inside.   alone now. afraid to trust, afraid to step past this ledge to see what's below. love thrown at her feet but her hands cannot seem to grasp it. bend over. pick it up. how?  she doesn't feel good today. maybe it's just another one of those days. maybe she's just tired. maybe, damnit, there are so many maybes. maybe writing as a third person throws her into an oblivion a while, of pretending that it's all okay. maybe that is her defense mechanism, the ability to step away from it all. the ability to just ignore. the selfish immaturity of just turning the other cheek.   she's still a kid lost in a big big world. and like a kid, she still has hope. hope of finding, hope of dreaming, hope of so many things and beyond. pixie dust, fairies, god, angels and all that. someday she tells herself, as tears put out the burning candles, i'm alright. no big deal. just another day.  let me hide in the darkness just a while.    urlLink  "Her heart raced at a lunatic rate, bells rang, the voices laughed, somewhere in the not so distant past a baby cried, and above all the silent noise she whispered"     urlLink  "because no one listens and so she cries (like the sea and waves) because everyone hears but no one listens"

      because i didn't have much to say and some weird stranger wanted to know. :P   urlLink      eighteen random things you really didn't need to know from racheal about life.     i.   sometimes, when i cannot sleep late at night, i sit crosslegged on the floor in the middle of my room and light up my ciggarettes in complete utter darkness, just because.    ii.  i also seem to learn a lot of about life that way. thinking.    iii.   some lawyer in london related to me is going to start blogging here. :)    iv.  i turn nineteen in a couple of months. i think i'm scared and quite excited at the same time.    v.  as wrong as this sounds, i refer to knackered as being piss drunk. (which happens against my will more often than not.)   vi.  i think starbuck's mud pie ice-cream on oreo cones along with a side of great company is absobloodylutely terrific. though whipped-cream smiley faced waffles come in a close second...    vii.  i think the idea of discriminating against sexuality is absurd.    viii.  i have a thing about eights. don't ask, i don't know why either. lol, just strange like that i suppose? :P   ix.  i am pretty bad with the whole controlling emotional behavior la di da though i also think i've been doing not too bad lately.   x.  but then again, that might also be the prozac talking.    xi.  i have very very strange dreams.    xii.  is it possible to be needy and distant at the same time?   xiii.  i come out with so much shit sometimes it's amazing.    xiv.  it's stupid but sometimes i apologize for being who i am.    xv.  and other times, i'm such an obnoxious little confident bitch which gets interesting i suppose. :)   xvi.  i've been blogging for two years now...and it's damn hard to shut me up! :P  sarahkate: discovered. even angels fall.  karac.com/~just me hiding. sobrevivir : learning to survive. heartstrings and shiznit. mistated; life is like a dick: when it's hard, fuck it. she = hopes: there are moments when whatever the attitude of the body, the soul is on its knees.  sarah @ warmcompany. latin for love. mnemosyne: stripped.    xvii.  my redesign dateline is two months. now whether that will happen, is a different matter completely.    xviii.  exit upstage: hope is a damn blasted nice feeling. :)      urlLink  "I got up so early and everything felt so different."

      i stumbled into their bedroom somewhere between the hours of dawn and dust. it couldn't have been more than five in the morning, perhaps around three or four. i knocked on their locked bedroom door and set off many, many alarms at that. some infra-red shit sensor had caught me and that definitely woke them up. i felt like a thief.   i said i wasn't feeling well. eyes welling up with tears clutching to my body pillow, slanting against the wall. i said everything hurt and i felt like shit.   and she put her arms around me and i cried.   i cried and sobbed for the longest time ever, not quite knowing if it was just the physical pain that was making me so delirious or if it was something more. something more like i only had four weeks left, something more like i couldn't decide, something more like i missed being cared for, something more like i didn't feel like being responsible and grown up in that moment.   and then i think we both realized that i was still a child. that as much as i tried to be tough all the time, the smart ass that i am...i still had so much to learn. that all the facades and all the masks faded; i think she saw a different me last night, and i think as much as my demons are fuck heads in my mind, i think they helped me show her a little of my world last night.   and so someone did tuck me into bed.   and made me fresh orange juice at four in the morning.   and laid out my multicolored pills to take.   and now, i do feel better. a little stronger at least, a little more renewed.   but still wondering. still waiting. still trying to figure out life.   still growing up.   thanks for the get-well wishes you bums, this hard-headed annoying whining bitch gets all touchy-feely sometimes.    hugs  :P     urlLink  "As the final dust motes settle in the moon's silver glory, she looks at the chances and the stories left untold."

      the server is having problems of it's own. big time.   and about the only bloody thing worst that having your head pound, your insides feel like mush, your nose give the tap a run for it's money and every single solitary part of your body hurt is THE FUCKING HORNY NOISY SCREAMING BLOODY CATS next door.   it's 1:49 in the morning and i'm running a temperature.   i am not in a mood to be fucked with at all.   i look like shit and i feel like shit and nothing is helping.   i am lonely.  i am tired.  i am cranky.  and i am sick of being sick.   right about now, i'd like someone to cuddle me, wipe my tears and tuck me into bed.   :(  goddamn this distance.    p/s is it terribly against the law to pour acid(my cooking) on cats?

      i dreamt about her last night.  i remember bits and pieces now but they are rather haphazardly put together; like an old, old black and white film restored, jumpy, missing bits, sound and picture quality not quite right.   we were holding each other close in this stark white empty room and there were no words. only us breathing together. only us waiting.   the floor was layered with fine white silk except for a splattering in the middle of red taffeta cloth; i'm sure it must have meant something, heck, i'm sure the whole dream must have meant somehting. she was so close though, so close that i could smell her. smell the faint scent of her perfume, sexy body perfume i used to call it because of the bottle shape that it came in and i miss that smell. i took it all in, the smell, her smell, being in her arms again....love.  i could feel my back against her breast, so smooth, so naked, so aroused. by me? but yet there was silence, and yet we did nothing, we just sat there...waiting...though waiting for what i wasn't sure.   her white almost translucent skin against mine, a long long line that ran from her navel down to the tips of her toes. her curly sun-streaked hair, her smile, the sadness in her eyes, her blood red pouting lips.   and i missed her.   i stirred awake, wanting so desperately to hang on to that dream, wanting to ask her so many questions but she was already gone. i took a deep deep breath in, wanting to comfort myself with her smell again but there were only traces of blood on my pillow and a mind numbing headache to wake up to. she wasn't here, it was only a dream.   it hadn't happened.   then why?  then what?  stepped back into the polluted streets, the raging motorcyclists, the beeping cars, the sweltering heat. stepped back into reality, into the stark oppresion of sexual prefferation, into the blinding aftermaths of progression. regression.   i swear the drugs are making me hallucinate.    urlLink  "People like to ask.

      so i was telling stinkypoo last night how amazing i felt, how healthy my new vegetarian diet was ; how this bodybalance thing i took at the gym that had yoga, tai chi and some other ancient asian practice plus the working out, getting the toxins out of my body, changing back into this dermalogica aromatheraphy soothing smanzy shiznit and all that bloody bullshit was making me feel so good and all that.   i wake up this morning and not only do i have cold, a head pounding shitting headache but that i also have a nosebleed.  fuck.  that.   my throat feels about as good as sandpapering your insides.   :(  we also have tickets to go see the bolehwood awards tonight.    life is swell innit?  hope your day's going a whole bloody lot better!   love, the bitch from hell.

         so i've decided to sponsor three amazing people for the  urlLink blogathon  this year.    urlLink michele  because i love her and it's become sort of a tradition.    urlLink peter  because i know he can do it and world education is always good.   and newly found  urlLink aphoristic  because he's helping get rid of the 'dragon' and there are knicker promises.   on a side (sappy) note, this is also for  urlLink brian  , wherever you are buddy, whatever you're doing, i hope you're looking down from heaven with the kids and smiling, at peace, and rocking it out. i'm fighting my demons, dragons, whatever and whatnots down here and thanks for everything.   ....i've been working with the kids for about three years now and it is a challenge sometimes. an extremely rewarding beautiful experience nonetheless, but heartbreaking too. in some ways, it has shaped me into who i have become and made me stronger.   i was looking through the archives of the other place and attached a random cut-paste collage of things i wrote about the kids. it's a lot of drama and what-not but oh well.   hugs.  thank you michele, peter, and keith, for doing what you do.   if you have a little bit of change, or words of encouragement, or anything at all...i hope you guys would consider it?    ----  urlLink  [ Mon Dec 10, 2001 12:20:21 AM  ] facing up.   "i realize how i have so little time left with them, how time is precious is so many ways, especially for them. i realize that for those few hours yesterday i was genuinely happy, genuinely content. that for those few hours yesterday my brain wasn't over reacting and my heart didn't feel so broken, in fact i think it was dancing.   i was dancing because i managed to make someone forget about their pain for awhile. me, this totally insecure crazy manic wimp made someone smile, someone happy, made them laugh. laughter is bliss in there, above the suction noises and constant bleeps that harmonize after a while. those irritating heart machines that beep every few seconds provide security to the moms and dads that sit by them, that wipe up the puke, that rub their backs, that cries silent tears...those irritating heart machines that beep provide hope....and i like hope.   hope is good. these are my kids, and everything is worth it. everything.

       i.  dont, under any circumstances at all, stick a pen down the socket when trying to fit a two-plug down a three-plug thing. you get electrocuted.    ii.  always switch phone to silent mode when in church. people might start giving you evil looks. especially the old ladies with afro looking hair and bad b.o. very traumatizing.    iii.  when going to eat at the pasar malam, don't ask what's in the food. you /really/ don't want to know.    iv.  pinch ash's yummilicious butt.    v.  hunt meesh, hani, and grace down so you can go down to the mamak stall, order teh tarik(lol, or todi?), eat a lot,  bitch, chain-smoke,  admire their boobs , take stupid pictures, and mengada-ngada.   vi.  don't tie a string to your finger to remind you to do something because a) you will forget, b) your finger turns blue, c) you look stupid. :P   vii.  thank profusely when recieving gifts from the way too friendly pak-cik no matter how strange sounding, weird looking, funky smelling the object is. or in my case, the shirt-cum-jacket-cum-some-poor-puppy's-furr. it makes them feel special and you can always donate it to salvation army later. people like 'someone you know' will definitely find a use for it. :P   viii.  you don't want corn, red beans and peanuts in your ice-kachang even if the weird people around you tell you you must have it that way because you will remember all the reasons why you don't like having it in your ice-kachang in the first place and you will not be happy. ruined ice-kachangs always makes you sad.    ix.  if the stupid lady with the big white hat tells you it's going to be just like an ant bite, RUN.    x.  don't send chris songs about linux. send microsoft happy songs instead.   last but not least, don't post bullshit like this is your blog. it makes you look very bodoh and cham.   :P   "sunday-lah....relekleh brother!"    urlLink  "You dance with the Devil, the Devil don't change, He changes you."

      would you trace the line that runs down my body and let your fingers love me in? would you kiss my forehead and sing me to sleep, read to me, tell me about your day? would you let me grip you tight and gyrate deeper in you as i come? would you let me see your heart, your smile, each night, every morning, whenever i open my eyes...it's hard to explain, this empty bed, even colder heart as you try and make our worlds seem so much closer than it actually bloody is.   i'm worried, i suppose because i'm insecure and silly sometimes. i don't believe that you believe in commitment, i have little issues i've carried from before but nothing quite as extreme. six months with someone and you learn a lot about yourself, about compromise, about recieving and perhaps most of all, about giving.   summer with definitely more than a couple of obstacles in the way, i think it's been harder than you expected it to be. i hear it in your voice sometimes, when you sorta get all quiet and soft with me and you almost whisper, i miss you. sometimes, i say i told you so, and realize that we needed this. that whole saying about treasuring the things you need around when they're gone is amazingly profound innit?   i love listening to you laugh. it's this giggle, hearty, happy little chuckle you have and it fills me up with so much joy. :) i love it when you say love. i love it when you say my name and i can hear you smile across the line. but i suppose, the thing i love most about you, is who you are.   you see, i don't need the dozens and dozens of roses, or the little things you pick up along the way, i don't need the simple thoughtful unexpected surprises, or all the crazily planned out carved out dates that are always so perfect. no, i don't think that;s quite it that makes me burst out laughing and singing at the same time, i think it is the essence of you. of the person that's beneath all the jokes, all the sensitivity, all the seriousness, and all the loving, i think it's about you. and the funny strange way you fit into my life.   it's not those things that you think are important to me, but it is so much more.   maybe it's love.   only you would clean the whole entire bathtub with a toothbrush and liquid soap for us, and only you would dress up with me to have a cute night out even if it's a weekday and we're both tired as hell. only you would make (and deliver!) cotton candy, drive out to wal*mart at three in morning because i can't sleep and piggy-back me down the aisles. :P or tell me i'm gorgeous even at four in the morning or ten at night. waiting up for me till some obscene hour for me to come home when i go out clubbing with the girls and nurse my sorry drunk ass. or encourage me to try out new things, believe in my dreams, and do jello shots with me tubing down some hide-away river with snakes and still find it fun(ny) as i yell at you because my face contorts in so many directions.   i sit here and so many memories flood through my mind and i want to list them all, put them in print and yell on top of my lungs bursting with pride. :) but there are so many things like the coffee machine, or jessica's little red box, or running through thrift stores looking for a size fourteen gown.   but even as i do that, i remember our latest conversation and how it sorta reverts back to i wish you were here as you tell me about the mall you went to today, and the super duper cool ceiling thingamagic they had that i had to come see or the evil looks you get if you open up your mouth to say one more word of me. heh. :P   i miss you ryan spicer. and i hate it.   mostly because it sucks balls and i could be with you but i'm just being a dork.   i don't know how being on the medication again is going to be like, i don;t know what all will change. i';m sure you've noticed the change already. i'm distant and we don't talk about it.   you worry because you don't know if the way i feel has changed, and you don;t know if i will return too different. and to be honest, i don't know either.   admittedly, considering the circumstances, it's crossed my mind many, many times to let things go a while...even with us back in pensacola. and i don't know how that's going to be, i suppose i wasn't sure most of all if you'd find someone back in jersey or if you'd fall in love again. i have your security but mine isn't strong enough to understand it.   sometimes i think i know exactly what i want, like tonight. yet there are others, like the last couple of weeks where i know exactly what i don't want. i don't want to jump into this again too soon, i don't want to do anything stupid that might jeopardize the movie. i don't want to act too fast, speak too soon, or have to much faith. and i know you understand that, and i know you know what i mean, and i know it doesn't make it any easier.   i guess tonight, i just wanted you to know that i miss you. and that you are a part of my life, whether i like it or not. and six months is a long time to forget.   ...you ask me to try again.   move in.   love you.   try us.   again.   i smile.   i giggle.  i weep.   i fear.   distance works miracles sometimes.   i'm glad you're still around.

      heh, you know you're in trouble when your mom stomps up into your room three floors above and yells out your full name. and i mean your full. name.   so it's around the bloody crack of dawn (i lied, it was 9) and me mom, apparently sending beeps and rings for the last half an hour, charges upstairs into my little area and wakes up the dead. she does it almost subtlely though, just sorta saying seventeen million things at once in which to my sleep deprived mind is rather comical.   this pagan needs to get her arse off the bed and go to church in 15 minutes.   right.   :P  and so once again, i find myself throwing things together, desperately trying to look somewhat decent and angelic cursing the hellfuck out of syrensex because of her countless seducing techniques in getting me somewhat happy last night. of course despite my lame attempts that well, pretty honestly, went unheard.   church was, well, church.   now, it isn't that i don't believe in god or anything, i'm just...i don't know. losing it? i think it's a phase, as i'm sure mickey will whip up an email about god's wrath and all that good stuff but yeah, onto other things.   my dad is very quirky. it's hard to explain...he's like this artistic, nice, gentle, shy person that rottenly spoils the people around him. and i speak from experience. :P  so he says we have to do lunch together and that there's some japanese place that someone or another said was good and so he had to take his wife and daughter there plus there's a flea market nearby, and flea markets are always good because i'm strange like that.   so here i am, nineteen (okay, eighteen) years old and all in the most godawful uncomfortable pair of shoes in my own little world a few steps behind my mom and dad strolling along hand in hand and jabbering on. and my dad stops by the little shops and shows my mom things and tells me about the different things of his week and my momplays along and humors him and i feel all warm and cozy in our little family except something's missing and my brother's not here.   of course i could make a sarcastic(jealous) comment about how he's backpacking through europe but i'll say this instead, dang i miss you koko. pah.   hm. i did however manage to find soem pretty cute ethiopian looking trinklets and what nots to bring back. there was a massive conglomeration(sp?) of coca-cola collecting freaks that paid 16 ringgit for a can of coke from america that you can prolly get for a quarter at wal*mart. madness.   haggling is fun though.   and so is hanging out with the old folks once in a while.   heh, after all, i can't blow my slut-bitch-snob-asshole cover now can i?  :)   urlLink  " "oh well, with age comes senility."

      the world waits in single silent eclipse sometimes...and there are so many things you want to accomplish in life. some rather comical desires better left to your inner self to explore, the others, perhaps more realistic, more real...more 'normal'. like finding a good job, like graduating with good great fantastic grades and climbing a mountain, or scaling the sky, jumping off some buildings or traversing the great beyond. you see, somewhere between all the pressures of life, all the talk, all the drama and all the glitz, the lines get blurred and you cannot help but ask, is faith just an ignorant selfish part of you that presses on, believes, to get the things you want? then if so, than the things that you have set out to do has been accomplished hasn't it?  you sit, in some cubicle of surrounding cubicles in a multi-storey building, filled with drones, office workers, people just like you, little pawns in the game of a metropolitan city keeping together so the building stands. and sometimes, you sit and wonder, at your cluttered desk tacked with the many pictures of loved ones, of happy joyous occasions, of little things from different people; quotes, inspirations, a plant, and you wonder.   you're eighty-seven today.    urlLink  "I can’t seem to indentify it with myself anymore, even though it was once such a defining part of me."

       urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink      she rushes home, somewhat unsure if she should go..it's been an up and down tiring kinda day with the medicine taking affect, the drowsiness, and the irritating dizziness that pounds into her head every time she moves faster than a snail's pace.   ...but yet she figures, since the plans are already made and the flight's already postponed; what much harm can she do to herself really right?  besides other than the alluring sexy, beautiful, people she's meeting up with tonight there are also the long found friends that she knows she'll have a good time with...  and so she takes a long soothing piercingly hot shower, scrubs herself off grime and other disgusting things she must have picked up in this awful humidity and terribly polluted city, but then again, the city has her heart at it's beck and call and there is something so enticing about it that she cannot seem to run away from.   she walks around, she's having an almost shitty kinda day. the kind where she doesn't feel like looking in the mirror much and the kind where she doesn't want to pick out something to wear because nothing looks right. she feels the ten extra ppunds she's put on, it's in her guts, in her flabby arms, in her cellulite thighs and her vastly expanding tummy. no, she isn't really having a low day, just a day where she just doesn't feel too nice about herself that's all.  she wishes she were taller, thinner, prettier eyes, nicer smile, whiter teeth, bigger boobs, smaller ass and so much more that she could list on forever. but she picks up her self-depricating ass and grabs a dress, puts on some make-up and goes anyway.   she goes to pick up some cigarettes at the mall but they are out of her favorite kind. she stops to look at the happy faces around her and stops for a while, as if to just say, chant, she's going to have a good night.   takes a cab, her first cab ride since she's been back and for some strange reason she is pissingly nervous. scared shitless almost.  the media hasn't exactly been too modest(?) with their coverage of crime. rapes, murders, robbery, charred remains, you name it, they've prolly reported it in the last four weeks she's been here. evil lurks out there and some flash of wanting to believe in humanity and being betrayed goes through her mind as clips from last night's late nights with astro patch adam's screening flickers.   ba da boop. ba da boop.   but then she walks down to smiling faces with open arms to greet her and damn, how she's missed them so. and they all sit around with their coffee and theatrical talk and catch up. and comment about changes. and marvel at beauty and innocence, but most of all friendship.   bigger two who is big shot director, producer, singer, super multi-talented amazing friend in which whom she loves to death. instructor, teacher, flamboyant and talented, honest, and upstraight young dude. beautiful kittie mom, who's trying to sober up, smiling, interesting, bloody good memory. kopitiam dress wardrobe designer person that she doesn't quite recognize in an instant but remembers nonetheless. the other three are missing, called away, the empress had a collision. hip mama and singing shy boy joins them later though at karaoke where they belt, scream, yell, croak(her) their way through the night.   she's dumbstruck by the band that's playing at the wine place tonight. they're fucking bloody awesome as she kicks herself for her cynicism. perhaps the local music scene hasn't quite died yet as she kicks back, smiles, draws in a breath and exchanges crazy travelling stories with humpty.   10:30 comes, and 10:30 goes. should she ring? is it okay? can she just gatecrash?  she walks dowm to meet them anyway, she is very much amazed at their kindness and open attitudes. like sure, although i have no idea who you are, what you are and all that, lets meet up anyway! lets go clubbing! lets play paintball!  and there is the girl, with whom she had a rather self-obsessed pathetic conversation last night with, looking kinda rather zonked out. sad almost. is something up? is she okay? then there is the other guy, the one she exchanges e-mails with, bright and smiling as ever over his plate of nasi lemak and cheeky grins. the boy that's ironed his special shirt, that smiles this warm inviting smile, and you smile back at these people and think, these are some pretty great people here.   they promise to meet up later and half an hour of frantic non-stop calling in between seventeen different cellphones results in a rather interesting clash of people.   the bloggers. the new friends. the rather interesting variety in which they sorta kinda understand the addiction to releasing yourself online. the blogging, the bullshitting, the random silly notes posted at any hour, at any place, of any topic. the people she's sorta come to know and am glad she knows.   other american girl and her definitely surprising buddy. the ex-girlfriend of the ex-boyfriend. she swears someone could have taken this out of a script. lol, first she works out with the other ex-boyfriend's ex and now clubbing with another ex-girlfriend of another ex-boyfriend? hm. interesting nonetheleast, doesn't quite puts a twist in her knickers but rather strange nonetheless.   new york in glasses and this red top that screams hot mama embraces her. it's funny how you sometimes meet people you know instantly you can be friends with.   along trots dancer, after rehersals and you run down telawi street in your stillettos screaming because you've missed him so much. the one that brought over ice-cream after school, the one that shared plenty of nights by the pool smoking and crying on each other's shoulders, the one that got you onto that terribly addictive dancing game and the one which you've had cup after cup of teh o ais limau with. yeah, the same dude that decided he'll get hitched in australia last year only to call it off, the one that sends you strange pictures of the french pianist and tells you explicit details of his sex life. yup, that would be him.   or the time you were co-captains of the cheerleading team and disagreed about anything and everything only to agree on everything else after. the only person you would drive out six million miles out of the way to shoot some tv program in malay with, the person you've held hands with in and out of the closet and through his many, many, many countless obsessions with boyfriend of the week. :P  one year is a long ass time to not see someone isn't it?  he worries about his rather 'rehersal-ly' attire. his gym bag and tap shoes for the competition this weekend, as humpty and dancer run off to put things in the car parked in some garage seven thousand miles away because six thousand and seventy two people decided to go out tonight.   and the musical theater people want to go salsa.   the bloggers want to go clubbing.  the friends don't quite know what they want to do.   and so you look like a retard running in between these three cliques but it is the highlight of your week! so happy, so happy, so damn bloody fantastically happy and you're not even drunk.   the salsa bar is closed and after bouncing around making an absolute fool of yourself at the club with the bloggers (who are much better dancers btw) you move on to join the mt people down at the karaoke place. you sorta smirk because where there is an mt meet, there is singing. :) and bloody good singing at that.   the night ends with having the streets again to the three of you, and it's the very same three of you in a car again minus the other two who are missing because of a certain indian musical instrument and the evil exams. you hug and kiss and sing and smile about and you wonder just what it's going to be like when you get back to pensacola and there are no more wednesday's or karaoke or random blogger meets.   oh well, i'm sure there are plenty and plenty of things to keep you occupied like waffle house and wal*mart, barker and puck, blue-shirt and sexy pants, old man and madonna, stupid things and odd hours though there is one thing for sure and it's that you're definitely going to miss nights like this.   hm.     urlLink  "I am awake, but soft and blurry around the edges, of my vision and of my voice."     urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink

(a percentage of money is pledged to the malaysia hiv/aids foundation with  of every bottle of hair dye they use...or soemthing like that anyway)    he double toned it once by mixing these two browns together then bitched about how i had previously had it dyed black and something about the dye being hard to set, then of course he said, hey, what about this and that and that and this?  i'd totally forgot about the wall to wall being in bright yellow, the psychedellic blinding selection of nail enamels, the insane gossipy six thousand and seven shampoo girls though the soothing calmness of flowing streams from the waterfall and the sexy moans of diana krall did make things better though.  hehe, i sat for three and a half hours straight, me, sitting still, mmhmm.    of course, there was a certain white-suited slick chick that made everything almost a breeze simply by being there. :)  we came home, showered, putzed around for a little then went off to this extremely adorable place in tmn tun that had a fusion of east-west menu, a nice little place yet very cosy too.   we managed to sneak in a picture before the camera(battery) died..mostly my fault from all the 772 pictures we took in the room.   but yeah, pass or not?    urlLink  "Sweet!!!

      i wrote that almost a year ago and think about how much has changed yet realize how vaguely indistinct everything still remains. it tugs at some heartstring nonetheless, and i feel again, tears line down my cheeks only that there is an uncertainty if these are bad or good tears. perhaps both really.   i still see the same child, the heart--broken, confused, lonely, over-worked, tired girl. the same girl that looks back at me when i stare into a mirror too long sometimes, the reflection that's insecure and longing so much to find her place in this world. that reflection, that little girl, that stranger...will always be me.   yet i have found my niche too. i have found the person i can be, the same person that i have always been. i have found that though confidence isn't always around, that pride was an overrated thing anyway, for i learned so much more scraping from the bottom.   i take nineteen credits next term, that's back-to-back classes, the fall production, set stuff, the movie shoot and trying to deal with all my crap at the same time. a year ago i would have said, sure. uhuh. yeah. a year ago, i would have taken all of this on because it was expected of me, not because i wanted to. this year though, this year i take all of this on because i want it.   i am on the honor's list because i can do it. because i am capable and i am alright. i am in the fall production because i know i work hard at it, because i will sit and build the set, paint the shit, memorize my lines and live in the theater if i have to. i'm going to do the movie not just because i want to but because i believe in it. experimental or not, sundance or not, i have auditioned for it and i have gotten the part. it is a commitment and i will not fall shy of it.   i take care of the 'other things' because at nineteen i know i can no longer hide from my demons nor my dragons. fess up, eat up, shit up. time to get healed, time to be sane again, time to be a good girl.   and so tonight when my dad sits me down to talk about things i don'tfidget quite as much as i used to. i don't quite have the tough barrier i put up all the time, in fact, it was kinda nice letting him in. telling him i wasn't too sure but that i would try. asking him if it was okay if i didn't do so well. questioning if he'd hate me if i wasn't perfect.   ironic things like the transition from aneroxia to bullimia. the lengthening of things to come and prophecies i could have told you a long time ago.   the angels? the angels are doing fine.   i see them on wednesday. it's been a full-fledged year now, save the random emails, cards and letters...i've missed them. the sars scare was a deadly threat, immune systems down and everything, they were risks i was willing to take but knew i couldn't. responsibility and all that, and like they tell you constantly, you can't help if you need help.   i think about how i missed mun joon's funeral, i think about how 'mc donald's' boy is doing now. i think about chemo and all the things i have to say to them, all the things i know deep down in my heart is right now. i think and think and think, then i ask myself what the fuck i am doing, only to run back to the store and get more balloons to practice twisting them again.   i've fought my dragon and i'll fight it still.   dimples aren't just proof of identity you know.   :P   i think about him sometimes. not too often now, i think about how last summer he was all i ever thought about. all i ever dreamt of, all i ever wished for, all i ever breathed about.   ....and then i think about the other people that have come into my life, no matter how briefly.   i think about barker, and the crazy insane way he laughs. the smile i genuinely look forward to seeing each night, the arms i want to hold me at night. i think about this summer and how long-distance is a bitch. i think about having him around, then not, then the in between. i think about how oddly ironic that we're closer now then when i left. or that he's so much more real, that i am so much more trusting.   i think about love, and how i am still not quite sure what it means. or what it represents. but that i am sure, beneath everything, beneath how my life has shaped up and above all things, that love was somewhere entwined into it all.  i thank god for friends and family. for trust and patience. for hope and adversary.   life isn't always so easy, but life isn't too bad either.   and so tonight, even if i am still rather not too good, and even if i am a little cranky and tired, i am happy i've made it but most of all, i am happy i have tomorrow to look forward to. and the day after. and the day after, after, after.  ----    [Thu Jun 27,2002 06:33:28 AM | + racheal | edit ] Paradox.  I wish to say I didn’t care, but today when I came home alone, I wept again to myself, swallowed pride and sobbed into my soft old pillow…comforting. I remembered again promises for tomorrow and things we had said, I remember again conversations that played through my mind again and again. And as music vibrated and put me to sleep, I dreamt of autumn and the changing awesome colors and falling leaves and how I was looking forward to seasons again.   I looked at my blistered feet and stretched my body, looping and twisting it around, contorting it so that it remained flexible…feeble. Put aside my jazz shoes with bare feet on the ground I trained to loud annoying beats and rhythms and twirled and twirled, lost in a trance of another world I let myself be free. But soon it became work again as I sharpened my moves and became anal, a perfectionist. drenched in sweat and a cloud of exhaustion, just me, a sponsored adidas sports bra and a pair of shorts in a too cold room and a ruined pedicure. I really liked nike anyway.   I wondered if my no show of emotion came because I am ready to leave and move on and change. Because there’s only so much I can take and something tells me my bubble has burst already. I am sick and tired of this place and the people and all these emotions and excess baggage. The next few weeks promises to shake it all off and clean that slate again…and I am thankful. But yet tonight when I listened to him speak and heard his every emotion I walked away, I refused to let him see me cry nor comfort me, I drove in silence and bit back the tears, keeping it all in me for I knew I would have to sit for dinner with my parents and I have mastered the art of protecting them. And so I choked down dinner and played with my food and commented on the lovely wine and the great food and talked about my entirely fictional ‘great’ day and I listened to them tell me theirs and even stayed to watch the beginning of lord of the rings for the six hundred and seventy second time with my dad.   Then I quietly and subtly excused myself and collapsed into my room and with it came the torrents of racking sobs quietly hidden by sade’s loud moans and drones. I like sade. I let and felt ever tear stream down my face and cried for everything that had fallen apart. For new zealand. For friendship lost. For good times and memories slowly slipping away. For broken promises. For hurting words. For losing the people you love and for being robbed of the ones that were meant to be forever. For angels and heaven. I cried for my imperfection and missed the person I used to be yet a part of me never wants to be her again.   I have lost certain dreams and am afraid of building new ones and that upsets me…because I used to be confident and brash and care free. I used to not have any hang ups and used to know what I was made of and what I wanted. I used to know myself but lately, I am a stranger to me.   I go through preset routines like smoothies and coffee in the mornings and cleansing, scrubbing, masking, toning, curing, moisturizing and protecting at night. like using chopsticks with my left and a eating with my right, like picking out the peanuts in a snicker bar and anally portioning my food and it comforts me but I need a change of environment and to get rid of routines.   I need to stop going in to read what he has written and I need to stop caring. I need to let go and let be. I need to move on.   …and this is a hard way to it but hey, cold turkey might bring good.  I am hoping that this is for the best not worst and I am hoping I come back changed for the better.   Perhaps I might, perhaps I won’t but no one can predict the future but neither should you stop believing in it. I am not perfect, I have many many flaws and many many wounds to heal but someday, someday, it will all be okay and things will be fine…and someday, I will understand.   Someday I will understand why I have to do what I have to do and someday I will know that it was right.    first thoughts after a nap.   lord have mercy.     urlLink  "I don't know what will happen, and the Unknown is terrifying. I would rather sit on my little boat for as long as possible, rather than risk exploring the land before me, filled with possibilities that could lose me everything I have gained.

      so i absobloodylutely forgot that i had to meet up with the director person last night. of course i remember this at eight in the morning the next day. right. holy shit, i am in trouble.   now why didn't he just ring to remind me?  because the same brilliant ass that's sitting here having a slice of cold pizza for breakfast switched off her phone yesterday. lol, i swear, everytime i decide to have some peace and quiet something always crops up. conspiracy!!  hm. and so now i'm hammering off an apology on e-mail which is prolly the whimsical way out but oh well.   time for a cigarrette break.   btw. how is this possible that i am sitting in malaysian heat trying to not kill myself by being on stupid roads and me brother is on the way for a holiday in italy?   life's a bitch.   .....but i love it!!!!   :)     "imasouthernqt2: well the night that you get back i promise waffle house and walmart  imasouthernqt2: OUR waffle house!!!!  imasouthernqt2: with the spanish song and michigan"   wa-hey!

      it's funny how a couple of comments sparked on by jealousy laced with sarcasm can awfully change things around. two hours ago i was ending up my post preparing to throw together some things and share a drink with humpty but i got side-tracked. i saw it flash across my cell screen and knew instantly that this couldn't be good, but being the dumb narsistic word-for-people-that-like-to-hurt-themselves person i am; picked up anyway.   and with it came a surge of adrenaline, a blast of foul shitty hurtful accusations, a string of alphabets and letters, sentences and words all aimed quite directly at my being, at my heart, at who i was as a person...as who i was, who i am, and who i will be.   i took it all quite well really, rather surreally in some sense though i am quite proud. i listened, as always, but was too tired to fight back. to try and distill the bullshit, to try and deal with it and so i let him scream till all hell broke loose and he was done. scream, yell, curse, cry till he had nothing left to say.   i cradled my phone in my hands, not quite knowing what to do. not quite understanding all the feelings he had put in me, the hurt, the rage, the pain, the understanding, the calm, the everything. i didn't know what the proper etiquette was to be, should i be hurt that my ex-boyfriend, someone i hadn't talked to much less seen in the last three years suddenly felt the compelling need to tell me that i was bitch. that i had treated him wrong. that i had left without saying a word, that i never understood, that i had broken promises and had fallen. really, how /do/ you expect me to react? realize i love you when you're yelling? right.   and the odd thing is i sit here with marvelous three blasting through the speakers crying for you. crying because i know you're hurting, crying because there's not a single bloody thing i can do, crying because i know that tomorrow when you wake up and realize what you've done you will ring again, and apologize profusely...then go through the whole depressed hate myself thing. i wish i could hold you and tell you that it's just life. that in your drunken stupor, i understood that you said things you hadn't meant to say. i understand that ignorance is bliss but that i cannot tell you about how you're not the one. that what we had was just what we had. jesus, you're ten years older than me and i've been through hell to get this far, i've been through hell injust moving on.   i'd tell you about my nights but i figure why add salt to the wound? i'd tell you about how much i hurt a long time ago, about sobbing and feeling like a miserable piece of shit. i'd tell you all my stories if i knew that it would help you but i cannot.   sometimes, i lie awake in the middle of the night wondering what the hell happened. how things ended up so complicating when things had gone on so well. we were pretty good friends even when things were over, untill of course, when i came back. and that night. and the proposal.   ironically enough, the affair with you split up what i thought a long while ago was it. but it wasn't, and he painfully drilled it in each and every time as he reminded me of the many things you did to me. i used to be so bitter, now i am just tired.   tired of the drama, the lies, the bullshit.   it all seems so juvenile, so trite and drawn-out....  you ask me rather strongly, am i happy with him? is he the one? can i sleep at night?   and to be honest, i don't know. if anything, i am still a stupid teenager unsure of the world, looking for my space in the world, my little corner.   i am not ready for marriage and kids, not ready for long, long term and retirement plans. we take it a day at a time but for now, for now it seems right. for now it fits.   for now, being with someone that loves me, respects me and needs me, completes me.   why am i sorry that i'm okay?      urlLink  "There is a moral in there for us all somewhere, I’m sure."

      there are so many things i want to blog about but like all things, i seem to be a little retarded in trying to find the words or if anything, just being in the right frame of mind at the moment.   perhaps i'll just sit here, cross-legged buddha like style and pray that a sense of peace will wash over me as i go into a chanting mantra that spraypainted green purple dishwashers are safe. or not.   you get the gist anyway, i'm rather incoherent at the moment. blame the caffiene, blame the insomnia, blame whatever the hell you want to blame but the little crazy old woman down my street that does these tai-chi kicking flying things every morning at a quarter past six in her front yard.  blame the little gwei-loh kids down my street that seem to be constantly craving durian as the toxic waves makes its way down over and a morning smoke turns into a nightmare. or just blame my pagan lazy ass that couldn't get up this morning for the 10:30 service.   i haven't been out of the house at all today, minus the brief six or seven minutes i got stuck talking to a neighbor that wanted to know if she could steal some herbs off our plants or something to that extent anyway.   i missed the fourth of july celebrations but nonetheless, we had a party of our own at home last night: a day late but a day right technically. i can't exactly say that  we  i got absolutely knackered but a little happy might be the right term. no fancy fireworks though and much to mickey's credit, definitely nothing like the fantastic fantasmic. pah. :(  ....somehow, i don't think a massive array of candles on a cookie cake decorated in red, white , and blue splashed with 'happy fourth!' quite counts either...  hmm...it's half past eleven and i am absobloodylutely bored. nevermind that i've slept most of me day off and cannot seem to figure out the template codes for the current page(apparently, the permalink is down as it has painfully been for the last few months..) and can't access the original codes because they're stuck in the hardrive somewhere 100000000 miles away in  pensacola  alabama. hm.   bagaimana? (lol, how's that for a little malay eh?)  speaking in which, kl bloggers...i've told everyone and anyone about the meet yesterday and strangely enough, i think i'm more excited now. (!!!) lol, i flipped through the links and what-nots the main page, read through the group discussions and think, HELL BLOODY YEAH! *grins*   and btw, about all the incriminating pictures uploaded: harruummpphh. it wasn't me...really.   ooh, humpty-dumpty just rang. mamak calls.   fooooooooddd!!!  :P     urlLink  "I cuss.

       urlLink    urlLink    urlLink      i'm rather a little intimidated. i wonder what they'll think, who they are, if they're half as excited, if how bloody nervous i am will show....but then the caffiene takes effect and i am off speaking at seventy million miles an hour; coherence and sense not quite making it and it's rather a little odd. i laugh a lot to hide, giggle really...and soon i am just rambling. ah well.   :P  she is quite as amazing as i've expected her to be. to the other buddy that talks to me about newts and ipecac, it was absolutely brilliant meeting you today! i am every bit as honored and dumbfounded...it's strange how this whole meet people on the internet thing works...ironic really if you think about it. but yeah.   i didn't quite keep track about the number of people that went...enough to fill up three tables and a side though. a cordoned off area, four bold square artpieces splashed with black swipes on the wall directly mocking me. distracting but nonetheless appealing....i find such fascination in the bloody weirdest things sometimes?  today i felt everything and nothing.   i felt what being different was like and i'm not quite sure if i enjoyed it or was upset by it. i couldn't help but want to hide, layer, shit around and not bring things up. it's hard being here and having to play the seperate facades. sure, i'm bold and bitchy, stupid and loud here but despite all the revealing, rather naughty pictures as the current layout now, i felt stifled. there was something uneasy about the room, perhaps it was just me, my disease, my demons mocking, screaming, protesting....perhaps it was just being up at an ungodly hour, perhaps it was just insecurity.   things are a lot more conservative here, i was embarassed. shy really of this place and i hated that feeling. that i wasn't too okay with being honest, with being who i was. i wanted to hide my american self and that life, i wanted to say so many other things i could not verbalize.   i happen to think that i'm also rather a little melancholic after a long drive home from the airport. after a week, seven whole bloody days, i am a little displaced and unbalanced to see them go. it's been a good week, and with all that has happened in the last couple of days....i'm doing pretty well. or so i'd like to think anyway.   i don't know what it is. here we go again where i draw back to the part of trying to explain things. i don't think i quite fit in but i was definitely welcomed. i suppose we choose our own destinies and feeling the way i feel right now just oppresses all proper thoughts of sanity.   in any case though, i would do one of these things again. i enjoyed it so if you're reading this and you happened to be there today....thank you for sharing my saturday morning with me. it was a pleasure and definitely eye-opening.   terima kasih.    urlLink  "I whispered to him that if we don't have time for our friends, then our friends will not have time for us.

      he laughs and giggles on the line and sometimes, there's ackward silences. moments in which we're both sorta like uhm, then comes the funny laugh. the look at us we're being retarded dorks ones.   we talk about summer and how things are going in our respective worlds. i tell him how it's strange being back here....and how insanely different it is. he tells me about jersey and the boardwalk, his friends, the people, his life and i cannot help but smile and hold him close. it's funny how little things can make big moments.   he says i've been thinking.   and instantly i know, here we bloody go again.   i want to stop him before he utters those words, i want to stop him before he adds more swirls to the already overlapping confusing spin.   and so i say, uhm.   and i laugh again, we tlak about other things.   escaped another day.   our roles seem to have switched, it's a little bit disturbing and comforting at the same time.   ---  i am a needy person. i have a million weaknesses, a couple of hundred thousand flaws. yet i find myself striving to be independent the last couple of days. not wanting to need anybody and it's strange.  but anyway, jokingly (seriously) i said, lame attempts at trying to be non-chalant about it...as if it wasn't an issue to me at all; what would you do if i came back 20 pounds heavier and ugly?   "kiss you."    lol, and he makes it a point to mention that he doesn't need to think about it.   i am relieved, that he's still the same person and that i did not concoct him into life, but at the same time, i am rather cynical. i suppose i've done that my whole life; been a damn well bloody difficult lover.   but wasn't that so cute, adorable and absolutely corny at the same time?   :)  what i meant to say though was that i'm in a rather strange twist at the moment....i feel rather surreal. odd.   i sat down the other day in the waiting room pissingly afraid thinking, i really really want to do this. i really want to live.   every six months we go through this, and every six months i reaffirm my need to press on in this world, to live on, to renew dreams. and every six months i reach some stage where i worry if i might not make it at all.  challenges are posted all around you, the right person, the right being, 'the one' would make it through. i drift away and keep my distance...i've been doing that a lot the last couple of weeks. it's as if all the crap i learned in pensacola has disappeared into another realm and i'm once again stuck in this position where it is not okay to just be.   i always seem to find it much easier to just be whatever in florida than it is back here in kuala lumpur. maybe it's the stigma, or the environment. maybe it's just my state of mind. in any case, it's different.   denouncing the thought of a relationship or anything of that commitment when i am here. i suppose i am more trusting over there, more open, a whole lot nicer. i am very cold here, hard bloody bitch though in all honesty, that's prolly the stark opposite.   as much as i am more insecure in florida, i think i am a whole lot stronger.   over here, i am a lot harder on myself....a lot more abusive and it scares me. i broke down last night because i was bleeding again and i was wide awake having a panic attack. afraid of dying but even more terrified of living.   there's a huge stigma attached to mental health care here. it's a big conspiracy, a bloody taboo and so things are kinda hard and there is an enormous pressure to just keep things right beneath the surface. to hide.  i have an appointment next week with the doctor and i know i need it yet it still doesn't make anything easier. i know i have to take my meds but that doesn't make it any easier too.   i have been breaking down privately a lot in the last couple of days. it's part of the depression and i understand that but it just gets so hard when the demons in your head are screaming and the dragons are pounding. when you're crying so hard you're sobbing, and sobbing so hard it's almost impossible to breath but it's all done so quietly, so masterfully it's scary. when you know you're okay but you cannot seem to let yourself accept yourself for who you are even if you know that on some level you already do.   nights like this, when i'm still wide awake even if it's four in morning and thinking....i wonder if things will get better. in some sense, in some hope, i know they do. i know things have improved and i know that things will continue to get better but sometimes, like all rides, i worry about the dips that it needs to take to get on top and that scares the petunias out of me.   someday i'll look back at this and say remember when?   and someday i'll say, good job.   in any case though, i've been thinking too.  i don't know if that's good or bad.     pp/s HAPPY FOURTH OF JULY Y'ALL!!!! :)

      to the girl in russia that deciphers my soul and periodically sends me random emails, thoughts sputtered out, crafted into perfect flowing sentences, verbalizing tones in rhythms of poetry that brushes out the kinks. kind words, supportive...opinionated nonetheless but honest....perhaps even brutally at times.   she stares, heavily mascara-ed eyelashes flick over deep set blue-green eyes, a reflection of the ocean, a sense of peace of the place i've ventured off a while. return home, walk on water, traverse the seas; no one is here.   glamor case lies shining in the corner...collecting dust like the chinese like to say. i am a proverbial bullshit master; quoting, random data stored, strange inkling towards unknown territory.   dating, a little bit thrown into another world completely. pictures, real actual photographs taken on print...it's been a while hasn't it?  i miss your voice: does that sound stupid? i miss falling asleep with my ears pressed against your chest soothed by the rhythm of your heartbeat. i miss waking up to you and falling asleep spooned closely, protected, with caring, gentle arms around me. i miss listening about your day and making coffee in the morning. the odd way you try and differentiate between subject and matter, the strange way you categorize your demons.  it's different here, i know some obsessive intrusive part of me will desperately try and explain it but it's difficult. how do you put into words feelings that even you can't decipher?   his eyes light up....i can already see it happening:  could it be me he wonders?   you miss me?   yes you stupid, i miss you.  it's different when you're not around and seven hundred million miles away.  you owe me cotton candy.  --  three messages left on the machine. "prospectives" but i am not quite interested, i want to be held, yes, but meaningless sex and stupid relationships just doesn't seem to be my thing anymore...god, i'm growing old i tell myself. soon i will be a crotchety old lady bitching and nit picking at every bloody single thing....she laughs beside me and says you already do that silly.   she's here.   picked her up and we're having a brilliant time. it's amazing, fun, loving and it's a bit of everything that i need right now in some odd sense. we can enjoy girl things together, things heterosexual relationships can never reach. of facials, and spas, and shopping. of baking extra chewy chocolate chip cookies and eating cookie dough while counting the calories.   but she is also the big fat ex. and the word ex in itself says everything....it's gone good so far though.    to the special girl from kl, because you are beautiful in so many ways i don't even think you know. i am excited, nervous quite a bit, but this might be good i tell myself, i am a little insecure. intimidated. not quite sure. but we're doing this nonetheless, i will go through with this damnit.   search for words to say. what? i don't know. do i say it's alright or do i say you stop that right now? do i become the world's largest hypocrite or do i just support it because that's what friends do?  one of the biggest things of coming back here is realizing how many of my friends have eating disorders. was i blind earlier or just i just turn away and pretend not to notice. i see all the signs, she's aneroxic and she's bloody disappearing in front of me; the most disgusting thing is knowing that some part of me wishes i had the willpower of her strength to shrink so small too. it's odd what perverse pleasure we find in control. in being thin.  i understand the circumstances in which the kids, the girls, my friends, the others go through to battle with this raging disease. it is never ending and society is so damn cruel but still, there are times i look beyond that and think, what wasted years and trauma. what influential scars this emotional battle will hurt.    i made a new friend today, she stood beside me in the 6:30 powerstep class. she said she watched me in bodybalance the other night...said i was very flexible and happy. at peace, i looked so serene at yoga. i laughed and giggled, shook hands and said hey.   she's australian but a lot like me in little ways, of course i still don't know much and three hours of working out with someone doesn't exactly constitute judgement...she's nice though and i like her. she gives me good vibes but in a good friend type of way.   --  we went to watch full throttle tonight. salivate, gush, wow-ed.   then we ended up at that nook by bangsar and had nasi lemak, satay, mee goreng, fried fish thing and teh tarik. it could have been heaven but heaven would be digesting.   i'm tired, perhaps it's time to go to bed before i ramble somemore. it's been pretty okay though, the demons still crop up once in a while but things will be right evventually i suppose. he says i'm close to blowing a hole in my esophogus, i tell him to kiss it. it doesn't just end, just goes away, just be done with it...i bloody wish too.  drag me out of bed, choke me down with chemicals, dance for me.  up. right. forward. shuffle.   bellkay rings.

      sometimes, i feel so lost in this city. alienated...as if i don't belong. they say you're so ang-moh, so damn gwei-loh, and i want to stick my tanned skin, brown eyes, black hair into their faces, i shove durians into my mouth and proove my cultural identity, i want to say; i can too-lah  ...but sometimes, they don't listen.   what am i? where am i? who am i?  so attracted by the sounds, the streets..it's people. so enamoured by the food, so amused with the culture. a stranger in a place i apparently belong. too different, too american...this place is so conservatively protective sometimes. this place is living hell.   i've been here for about three and half weeks now, but still they look at me like i'm a tourist. foreign. it doesn't help, nothing helps. i am alone, i am invisible, i am so obnoxiously intrusive.   ...but it's okay. i'll be alright i tell myself...it takes a while. i'll learn, i'll eventually understand, i'll get used to it. what-the-fuck-ever.   i walked through chinatown today and i must have had 'sucker' plastered on my forehead. we went and bounced from shop to shop, bought shirts, trinklets, fruits, gold, bags, and six million kadoodle other things. a little pack of strangers in blistering malaysian heat afraid and i felt so out of place.   they're on the same boat and we talked about how we seemed so out of place sometimes. and i don't know what it is but i sit here writing now and i am so frustrated and contented at the same time. i long to go back and stay here forever.   i want to run to waffle house and bug the shit out of michigan. i want to curl in barker's arms and have him hold me to sleep tonight. i want to make fun of puck and take long drives with the old man. lie on the beach, visit mickey, go down town and bask in the emptiness of nothing. watch a hockey game and scream my lungs out....or soemthing.   but i enjoy this too. this constant flow of energy, of seven hundred things going on at once. of people and more people. of people that look like me, speak the same language but not at all. i love the smell of this place, the comfort this place reeks of. peter hoe's, bukit bintang, midvalley, chinatown and the markets. the orangutan shop in malacca and the nasi kandar stall in the middle of nowhere.   i fixed dinner the other night and the maid had a good laugh. i found and understood absolutely nothing in the kitchen. my diet has changed strangely enough, i don't know what i want to eat because there is so much to eat...and it is all very diferent.   i've missed the kids, the girls, and my friends. but soemthing feels so off about the other picture, something feels so bloody off-coursed about this frame. like i'm about to embark on a journey to hell, like i'm betraying, hurting, and lying to myself, to him, to the people around me. like i know i should not do this, if only, in the end, to protect myself.   i'm tired and they're jet-lagged.      urlLink  "Everyone has a million stories in their head, all of them connect and form a safety net of experiences that are tagged and filed away under quick reference words, or smells or colors or whatever. You're sad when you smell freshly cut grass, but only you know why.

And for a moment you like feeling nothing."

      monday drag show night...  four fairies, a dyke, three breeders and two confused. a good crowd i must say, especially when you're trying to negotiate between the feuding fairies who have now decided that they will exchange partners.   yet again.     "but honey, he was soooo last week!"   uhm.   yeah.  which of course brings in to my next big question in which a certain breeder could not keep her hands off me. strange? very. confusing? even more so.   saw the ex-girlfriend in naked glory, which of course pulled me aside to show me her new tattoo at a place i would rather really not ever remember touching, all this while i smiled and said oh?  and she looked good too.  damn bitch.  she wore a mesh shirt with nothing beneath but black electrical tape. i'd forgotten about her nipple rings, her and her statements but damn she was cute.   and the best part was probably that she knew it too.   imagine this, the couch, dorothy oz(formerly known as chick from emerald city) and 'other breeder' locking me in.   and it's almost amusing to see the competition between them two.  one rubs her legs again mine.   the other puts her arms around me.  one wants to show me her new tattoo.  the other sticks a lollipop down my throat (?)   one plays with my hair.   the other strokes my arm.   and the only thing i can think about is WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?!?!  screams.   lots of them.  it's like lesbians galore in full strength and everyone run for hug and i repeat my summer story six million times but it's okay i suppose. because the boys are just cute like that and are always the best listeners.   (how do you shut a gay guy up?  you tie his hands together :P)  then come the pictures.   and more drama.   and x's and dollar bills.   of ricketing, swattng indecision and clap, clap, claps.   i keep my distance and am very uncomfortable,  one because she's straight for crying out loud and the other because well, let's not go there again.   and she questions me, as we are leaving the club and i am desperately thinking of ways to avoid the inavoidable goodnight kiss that will turn a competition yet again, don't i miss being with a girl?  say what?  of course i do.  i miss the intimacy.  i miss the closeness and the vulnerability of a woman. i miss her hair, her eyes, her touch. i miss a lot of things, but i'm beginning to think that i'll be okay, that i'll be fine down this path and yes, it scares me. it scares me a lot.   i draw back to the conversation with the head doctor in which i tell that i feel like i have lost a significant part of me. that in between growing up and all that good shit, i have become less confident, much more vulnerable and a little bit more jaded and naive at the same time.   and for once, i can tell her that i don't feel as much of pressure like i used to. i don't wake up in the middle of the night suffocating and panicking because i am afraid i will never be enough.   right now, i think i'm beginning to let myself be okay, tell myself that it's okay if i'm not prefect. that it's okay if i am not enough, or not thin or not pretty. that it's okay....that i'm okay.   that the world isn't going to crash, fall, sink beneath me because i let myself be.   ...and it's been seven months since i started dating barker.  it's been a rough summer.   i've moved out, in more ways than one, and that signifies a million different things.   it took us six and half to admit we were falling in love, that we we needed love and whatever stereotypical things couples are suppose to do.   and he broke down when i finally said those words.   and it was strange.  and it was weird.   and it was very freaky.  but it was also very nice.   and very comforting.  seven months seems like a long ass time.   but it's not enough.   but it's scary.  but we're going to make it.   the swingers are together, how much more crazy can this world get?  the strangest part is knowing that he understands. understands that craving, the girl days, the swinging....or at least makes a good show of it anyway.   and i miss him moving in me. i miss the way his lips trail every inch of my body and makes love to me. i miss the explosions of passion and lust, desire and trust. i miss curling into a warm body and feeling safe, i miss skin on skin and an erection so hard it makes me giggle.   it makes me giggle because i did that.   it makes me giggle because he wants me.   it makes me giggle because i am loved, i am needed, i am wanted.   and suddenly, it is okay.  and suddenly, i don't feel so ugly around him.   and i let him strip me.  and i let him undress the layers.   and come close.  and lock the door behind him.   and open my heart.   he comes home in two weeks, and last night was the first night we didn't talk. my pills have been acting up on me so i took a wrong dosage and knocked myself out with it.   waking up to find it was twelve hours later and sunlight had risen.   i am home, in a foreign place, but home strange enough.  school started on monday.   i'm making dinner tonight.   labor day weekend starts tomorrow.   life  goes  on.   :)   how are you doing?  ((hugs))     urlLink  "I do think I need this trip though the underlying reason for it is no longer as pressing or obvious."

       "it could be well that i'm going mad; or, on the other hand, that i am simply confused and unhappy; or, on the third hand, that i know exactly what i want but cannot bring myself to do it because of all the pain it would cause, and the tension between those two states of being makes me want to explode. but when david touches me in that way, with tenderness, with love and concern, it all dribbles away to nothing, and i just want to be with him and my kids for the rest of my life. i don't want to touch stephen, i want to row about what david may or may not have said to other people, or what he certainly said to molly and tom. i just want to do my job do my job during the day, watch dinosaurs in the evening, sleep with david at night. nothing else matters. all i need to do is hold on to this feeling, and i'll be fine.   we go and sit in the car for a while, and david lets me cry.   ....it doesn't occur to me for a moment that for david my confession marks the beginning of something, not the end of something, and just because he has known me for twenty-five years, it doesn't mean that he knows me or understands me now. he's quiet for a moment, and then he says, "can you come home tonight?"   -nick hornby

      i had biscuits and gravy at this hideaway diner place for breakfast today. awake at the crack of dawn, taking a fifteen minute walk down familiar streets, way too friendly neighbors and trying to soak in all the warmth of a bright summer morning.   if i had to complain, it was too hot. and i was up too early after restless hours fighting with the night demons, but yet, i knew i had to do this. had to walk down, had to paint on a brave face, had to go give and recieve hugs. and so i did it. and so i was happy, smiling, laughing, amazing, perfect racheal a while.   and i felt her tiny arms squeeze around me, as they all rushed to say hie to racheal. as their tiny squeaky voices said i miss you, and they sat around me as i braided hair, colored strange objects, and folded origami for them. i listened to summer stories and watched as each child fought for attention....a swift clumsy action and there was orange juice everywhere. orange juice on the table, orange juice on the chairs, orange juice just everywhere on everything.   and she starts crying. wailing. screaming. i pick her up and walk her down and attempt to calm her down. soothe her. it's all okay honey, it's alright. lets go get more okay? that's my girl, it's okay sweetie. here, it's alright. smile. smile. smile. smile. smile.   and i don't know if it is the shock of having orange juice splashed all over in a split second or just realizing that in her little three year old mind, orange juice is that important to her. and i wish i was three again, and i wish all it took to calm me down was hershey kissies and a walk outside a while. and some place in me fought to keep the tears down, some hole in me begged to be filled.   and soon it was ten o'clock, and the kids asked if they could come over and swim, or hang out a little more, or bake chocolate chip cookies, paint t-shirts...everything and anything. and that made me so happy and sad at once, to be so needed, to be so loved. it was strange, i don't know why, and so i let them come over and hang out a while.   and played more of perfect, happy, responsible racheal.   and when they left, i cried for the longest time. cried for the emptiness inside, cried for uncertainty, cried for fear, panic and disorder. cried because last thursday i was scared with so much news coverage again, cried that another anniversary is rolling around.   i am only me.   and sometimes, i think i will never be enough.   that i will never fill my parent's shoes.  that i will never be a somebody.   that i will always be just plain stupid retarded ugly fucked in the head racheal.  and my heart hurts.   and i hurt.   i hurt because i used to be so much, so happy, so free, so confident. and somewhere along the line, the kid in me took a vacation and i became so cynical, so ugly, so hard. somewhere along the line, i became this horrid existence and i find myself constantly fighting to stay alive. to keep peace. to just hold on for one more day, one more hour, one more second.   afraid i will break.  afraid i will go so fucking insane.  afraid i will let my friends down.  afraid i will never make my parents proud.   afraid i will embarass my brother.   afraid to be me.   and so i swallow the plethora of bullshit they feed me, praying for chemical balance, and the next appointment with the head doctor is in nine days.   but already i am running.   hiding.   fighting.   questioning.      urlLink  "So here's to friendships (old and new, lost and found).

         i love this picture of us. there's something about it that says i am happy with you. something about the arrogance and bitchiness on my face and the joy on yours. something about having you hold me close and something about the way we are grinning and how i am safe, happy that night.  i've been stuck in my pj's for the last two days...wavering in between sleep, paranoia, depression, hopelessness and crying. having phone conversations with barker that start when he gets off work till six in the morning my time, and seven his when our free minutes are used up and we resort to i miss yous and trying to keep strong for each other.   i talked to you last night too, it was strange. the ending of summer love or whatever the hell that was. you say so many things at once, and i am suddenly stuck in the position of the 'man'. the irresponsible heart-breaker jerk that pulls the strings and won't commit. i keep thinking this is wrong and that we're seriously screwed up in some way, you, the essence of you, the warmth of your wet knickers on my thigh, the brilliance of your smile when you see me, the adoration, the protection, the regality in which you hand to me. i am your princess and you are my goddess.   but i cannot be with you.   i cannot hurt you, love you, need you the way you need me to.   we cannot hurt her.   we cannot hurt them.  and i say i'll see you at christmas.   hiding my private pains and smiling, laughing for you.  i keep thinking my parents don't deserve this, don't deserve to have this royally fucked in the brain kid as a daughter. and i begin to think that no amount of psychotherapy nor drugs will ever cure me, i begin to think i am incurable. that i am just fucked as fucked would be.   so fucking selfish in my own world, wanting to escape, wanting to run, wanting to only decide what's good for me.   still in my pj's.  still on malaysian time.   still hiding in a corner.   still crying alone.  i really hate me sometimes.

      i just called but you were on your way out. why didn't you like the electric soft parade? bits of paranoia and wisdom.  i can't find the counting crows md that you made out of my cd which you took. you won't remember but you actually bought that cd for me to replace the one i lost. It was  the third incarnation of that cd (i lost it twice before and bought em again) There's just alot i never told you and you never asked. i wanna tell.  today i went to bar med with irene.met her would-be man who was reassuringly self-confident from travel and age. Phillip came along as well. you've probably never met phillip? Ahh..someone you should marry ..an ethical lawyer. i saw W in groove syndicate. She used to stay with sl some of me wanted to ask the wheres and whats but most of me did the wiser and stayed away.  your godmum found the ideal mid sized firm for me. she said i should call tomorrow. i'm thinking i should also call my godmum which i'll do tomorrow. Both senior partners are women and Joseph and his wife (your parent's friends from church) said that would be a problem. Now Joseph and his wife are cool no doubt but surely they did not expect me to rely on stereoytypes, misogyny and old fashioned patriachalism to make the very important decision of deciding where i am going to work.  So he tried a different approach with the next nugget of unintentional bigotry when he said "you should also avoid small indian firms" because of the reputation of underhandedness that comes with it.   What's a indian lawyer with ambitions and capital for a small firm gonna do? Mamakrize i suppose.  Having said that we are gonna have dinner with them tomorrow because there are obviously volumes of bigoted conservative values we must go through. (admittedly i begged for this)  i call it bigotry now but will i say the same when i've been in there long enough?  you have to keep me sane because no one else will.

      i sit here at the changi international airport in singapore, soothed by the sweet aroma of freshly brewed coffee lingering in the air and the distinct unmistakable smell of his perfume. i wonder who it is that's turning me on and churning my insides at the same time...could it be that gweiloh asian dude sitting across me, or that idiot in the terminal next door that keeps on staring at my breasts(thank you miss victoria)...perhaps it is that sweet old man with silver hair that smiled as me as i tried so hard not to cry.   if i could, i would take you all in my arms and hold you tight to thank you.   thank you for a great night out, thank you for friendship, thank you for coming out to the boondocks to see me off...thank you for the four in the morning chats and the long long unmistakable drives in the middle of the night. thank you for helping me make fun of myself and appreciating the darkness and laughter with me.   i search for so many words to explain how i feel right now but i'm not very sure at all.   i am sad, and happy. i am excited, and tired. i am so many things and nothing at all.   there is the absolutely seductive loneliness of depression that comes knocking on my door, the unmistakable call to wallow in self-pity and hide in the corner a while. i'm trying so hard not to cry now, it just turned three in the morning here and i am sitting alone at a desk writing out an entry into the big wide world.   tomorrow, later, for 36 hours, i will be on a plane back to pensacola.   i will run into barker's arms and hug the old man for the longest time ever.   i will go and poke stupid jokes at puck and scream at our newly purchased ringside ice hockey season tickets.   i will go back to school, take on a full load and try to make the best out of the next few months...the next few years of my life.   i am going back to hell and returning to heaven at once.   confused, heart-broken, tired and extremely melancholic.   this little indian girl that couldn't have been more than a few years my senoir leaned her head towards the window and kissed malaysia goodbye as we were taking off. i listened silently from behind to her weeping. the air stewards and stewardresses were nice though, so damn fucking sweet i wanted to stand up and hug them all for doing such a good job. i know how she felt, for somewhere in me, i was that little girl too.   and i still feel so small. like there is so, so many things i need to do and have to. i don't know, and i am scared. i am so fucking terrified of the world and my life ahead, and i feel so stupid. i should never poke fun at second chances, never take anything for granted...for if i lost it all today, what would i have gained? what lessons could i take with me? what concrete inspirations beyond materialistic superficial bullshit could i stand for?   i saw my hungarian goddess for the last time and for the last time, she called me princess, i felt my heart break.   i hugged me mom and dad tight, as my dad whispered into my ear, "we love you,".   and secretly i told my brother, take care of them for me okay? you be good, and entertain them and keep them happy and all that good stuff.   but i don't think i thanked him for flying out to see me.   i don't think i told him how much he means to me nor how much i respect him.   thank you koko, for everything, for being my friend and for being my brother.   i'm going to miss malaysia.   i'm going to miss catching up with the bloggers and painting bangsar red.   i'm going to miss all of you and i thank you again, for everything that you guys are to me. for coming out, for sending messages, for making phone calls, for throwing a great party, for letting me be drunk and stupid.   i thank you and love you guys for being just you.   for the lurkers, for the strangers, for the random people that come in every once a while....thank you for being a part of my life and for making dark empty days feel so much better with comforting emails and silly comments.   i have a silly grin on my face while the tears run down my cheeks, my plane leaves in three hours.   and i know i told some of you i was going into hiding a while.   and i know i said i'll shut down, settle down, redesign and open up again.   i just wanted you to know that before that, i love all of you.   as i run through my cell phone list to say goodbye.   as i wish again, that i could hold all of you close and hug you guys tight.   thank you for everything.   i'll catch you on the other side of the world..   love, peace, and big warm hugs,   stupid crazy silly alco horny retarded fat ugly hole-in-the-head racheal.

         we went filming last night; putting together a series of digital hoo-ha linebacked with shots of the city and everything that surrounded it. the crowded beggar infested streets of kuala lumpur, the hookers and food galore of jalan alor, the mist evaporating power hungry people at klcc, the brightly lighted up towers with the dancing fountains and calm serenity of the park next to it.   and admist it all, i could not help but feel lonely. slightly out of place.   i wanted so much to show him a part of my world, the places i had run barefooted through, or that rest area secret place we trained for many weeks leading into the finals...there were so many things, so many stories to tell and so much to capture but unsure of where to start from.   we filmed bangsar, with a slight introduction to spg(s) and their ang-moh clan. all done from a distance, candidly, rather unobtrusively from behind somewhere. or next to someone. or in the middle of something.   a few jittery frames here and there, a couple of messed up shots...commentary going stale and unscripted, just trying. just showing.   the world through my eyes.   the things i noticed.  the people i saw.  like that fucking clown walking down the telawi three.   (did you see him?)  or the akdemi fantasia people at starbucks.   the sexy salem girls moving in a green trailed synergy.   i wish i captured it all.   the sounds.   the smells.  the atmosphere.   but i tried.   the end product, a hundred and twenty minutes on tape unedited.   of me, me, me.   and my world, my life, my country.   but there is so much more out there....so fucking damn much.   not enough time, not enough drive, not enough passion.   not enough commitment, not enough people, not enough faith.  not enough love, not enough trust, not enough humanity.   emblazoned on the front page, chilling reminders of 9/11.  that fear.  that knot in your stomach.  those tears.    p/s a gift from barker.   :P    "She could feel the heat of her own breath reflecting off the vibrating, beautifuly shaped, pussy of the stranger girl as she dug her tongue up the girls soaked valleys.  The vibrator on low but deep enough inside to give very little grip from its' end.  She pressed with the tips of her fingers against the low humming toy and grazed it with the tip of her tongue as she made her second pass, this time drinking as she tasted.  "Was there anything more delicious?" She thought.  The girl grabbed her head and pushed it firmly between the girls muscular legs.  Lapping and kissing, she devoured every surface of the strangers sweet pussy.  The taste was only made incomparable by the act.  The girl yelped and moaned squeezing both thier breast preparing for cloud 9.  She drank faster now with vampiric lust bringing the honey to her mouth.  A memory flashed across her mind of a boy.  A memory of not long ago.  And as she shook her head and spread her tongue making a precious memory for this little girl, she remembered back to when she was the girl.  They had met at an audition.  She with false self-consciousness and he with false confidence.  In a blink as if no time had passed in between she was touching his hand, giving him her gift while he hesitantly gave his.  The girl's smooth under-clothes were nothing in comparison to the girl under the smooth clothes.  His fingers ice skating over her silky knickers pressing her milk to his tougue.  Then moving inside her, playing in the waves of delight as they lay on the beach with the waves of the night.  He lay her down to bed.  Both were naked and confidently free.  They played for the night a sexual game.  She was a goddess in the night's blue light.  Her eyes were honest, even as they closed.  He slid his tongue over her perfect breast.  Then sucked on her delicious tits, running his tongue from her chest over her tummy to her thigh.  He loved her little pussy.  She could tell by the look from his eyes.  He had used his tongue as a toy and moved deep, drinking, just as she was now.  He stood hard for her then.  His clumsiness masked by her feminine touch.  She grabed him and forced him within.    "This was it." she had thought as she moaned.  She wasn't even bothered by his cheap cologne.  The feeling inside her was like a massage of the most important muscle.  That night and many others she made him come for her and he made her happy.  As she thoroughly licked the young pussy of the stranger she remembered all this.  And looked foreward to someday soon when she would once again be.....The Girl"   heh, right on honey!

       urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink     hm.   it's never easy to start off a post where you willingly admit that you got shitfaced drunk as a motherfucker last night.   it's even more retarded when your ex-girlfriend, the bartender, tells you this morning on the way home that she spiked the other kid's drinks. with fucking tea.   and so while i had way more double fucking shots than i remember, a certain  urlLink sexy girl  and  urlLink intimidating smartass cutie  had shots of TEA.   i also got very acquainted with paprika's bathroom floor, the ceiling of jae's kitchen, and bits and pieces of last night's bullshitness.   i haven't been this drunk since...  since gulf shores.   two maybe three and a hlf months ago.  and caeleb.   and my first (and last) one night stand.   of feeling like i was raped again. going against everything that i stood for, screaming to say no but agreeing on the surface.   of feeling so dirty on the ride home.   and wanting to hide in the corner for the longest time ever.   but that was then, and this is now.   steve came last night.   you can say it was a nice big happy fucking family.   numb.  maybe i was looking to numb.  or escape.   or something.   i don't know.   as he whispered i love you.  i miss you.  i need you.   i said leave.  i said go.  i said touch me and you fucking die.   and i called him all sorts of wonderful names.   then walked back in and smiled.  and pretended.   and ordered another round of double shots.   as the ex-girlfriend came over to see how things were going.  as she whispered in my ears too.   as she held my hand.   as i let the evils of alcohol pollute me.   a tip off, a fucking raid. and jae swings into well, jae-action.   by this time, i am professing my love for everyone.  freaking the bloody hell out of my other  urlLink favorite gay depressed blogger . (who was very yummy btw)  we slip out the back door but i am only spinning and spinning. and keeling over wishing to die.   she rubs my back, and holds my hair, soothing me. calming me down, yet i am still thinking. yet i have not escaped.   the driver stops for coffee which i do not touch. my salmon salad for dinner comes out almost as fast and as easily as i would remember.   but yet it doesn't stop.   i am still spinning, and my mind is still going.   she carries me. my strong ass woman, lifts me. as i tell her i cannot negotiate the stairs, and i want to cry, scream and yell at the same time. escape me, escape racheal, escape tonight.   she tucks me into her bed. gets me changed, and strokes my back as i pass out.   and she is up for a good part of the night.   from when i wake up to throw up again, or sip water, or just need to be held.  to be told the world is an okay place.  to know that i am safe.   somewhere between dawn and morning the bastard calls again.   there are six million messages on the phone from friends.   and we talk.   i talk to him in jae's lap.  as he apologizes again.  and bullshits.  yadah, yadah, yadah.  i am angry.   i am hurt.   i am tired.  sober enough to know what's going on, yet still intoxicated to not be sane or adult about it.  i scream i hate you.   i scream you fucking lying cheating bastard.   and jae still rubs my back.  and jae still holds me tight.   and jae still says it's okay.  i hang up, wanting to throw my phone across the room, wanting to collapse into a fit of tears, wanting to escape into oblivion.  and i feel so stupid and dumb.   affected.  why?  bastard.   as i try to remember the good times from last night.   of bringing  urlLink meesh  to the other side.   and horny  urlLink dinesh .  and the fucking adorable  urlLink jikon .  of learning about monte cristos and cigars rolled by virgin thighs.   or having meesh pinch my sexy ass by gracie poo's demand.   or meesh and the kissing galore.   and raping jikon.  or terrorizing dinesh.   and i did have fun.  lots.  i'm just leaving in ten days.   and there's just too much fucking shit to deal with.   drama, drama, drama.   somebody hand me a bottle of aspirin.      urlLink  "aarrgghhh... Meesh and Racheal are so drunk... I've got two lessies on my hands. This is so not for real..."

         he lies, eyes closed for the first time in many days...so many things rocking and shaking, coming down in his world.   mom in the hospital again, and he is angry, upset, frustrated...so many things at once.   he holds my hand, i bleed, he calms me down.   afraid of the phonecall.   he has to be strong for everybody, the man of the house, the brother, the cousin, the nephew, the son, the boyfriend, the friend, the director, the producer, the manager, the everything and anything in between. yes, stressed would be an understatement.  and so many times i wish i could take it all away, but instead i just lie with him when he needs me to.  and stroke his hair.  kiss his lips.   love him.   it's five in the morning, and he's just finished unloading another box, unpacking another shelf, fixing another meal, securing another person.   i slip aside into the world and thank god for another day. precious, amazing life, i learned all about it today.   everyday.   he smiles at me from across the room, and says, what's up baby?  i say, oh nothing much.   he blows me kisses.   it's time to go to bed honey.   he sleeps.   we sleep together.

          lay awake; fall silent beneath angel wings that carry you over crystal clear jaded tears that flow between eternity and history flashbacks of bittersweet memories that surreally come pounding in on reality pixies and broken butterfly wings that lie drying(rotting) on the pavement this must be a soothsayer's dejavu experience this must be losing it in tranquility.     "we are the one percent."   the good news? : it isn't cancer.   the bad news?   : it's  pre cancer.  the smear came back bearing big fat chunks of alphabets printed in black ink ; abnormal.  abfuckingnormal you.  but i was calm.  just somewhat shocked really.  and he kept on saying, it's good news baby, it's good news.   i go in for a scope and biopsy on the tenth, two days after my birthday.  the good side, i'm going to turn nineteen. one of my biggest fears and one of the things that kept on going off in my mind...that i wanted to graduate, that i wanted to turn nineteen, that god damnit, i was still a fucking teenager.   the bad/strange/weird side : happy fucking birthday indeed.   precancer.   precancer.   precancer.  what the hell does that mean?  i am going to be okay right?  i'm going to be just fine.   then what?      urlLink  "the day went so fast and in such a blur that I lost my dimensional orientation "

       urlLink    urlLink    urlLink      we somehow ended up hosting four lovely japanese exhange students on friday night and to say it was interesting, kooky, fun, testing, and exciting all at once would be an understatement....put together a hodge podge of foreigners that speak only about a sliver of english, a little white boy and his dumb girlfriend and it results in lots of laughter, swing dancing, the dollar store, vietnamese food and terminator 3  ryan took care of the movie tickets in which the girls thanked us profusely for, this after unleashing them into the dollar store where they went squealing away in japanese and loading up on everything and anything for a dollar each!   perhaps one of the most amusing parts of the evening was attempting to teach them swing dancing. the instructors were going too fast for them (classes are an hour before the live music plays) and so they just watched and made their own moves! twisting around and jumping and turning....!?!?  there's something indelibly special about watching everything come together, the dancefloor spinning around with splashes of color, ethnicity and age...and the smiles. the hardwork, the confident and the shy, the layers that all merge into a picture that makes you step back and wonder at the glory of the universe.    his highlight was when a typical american pop song came on air and they knew all the verses and lyrics to jewel's 'standing still'. we struggled to explain 'brat' earlier and there they were mouthing, singing, busting out english songs. it tickled us quite a bit in which we then of course went into japanese cartoon theme songs...fuck yeah!    "ahn, ahn, ahn, do rae mo na chi su chi, do rae mon!!"   :)   we ended the night with sci-fi gore and arnie. just what every damn exchange student needs eh?  oh, that and rolling a house. my first induction to america and it's neverending use for toilet paper...  i had fun.   a full circle with someone else filling my shoes at where i was a year ago.   such a delight, such a joy, such a feeling that grows deep inside that calms you down and makes you realize you're already home in some odd special way.   ---- seven hundred and fifty two events all happens at once, things that need to be done now, now, now and people that have needs to be fulfilled right this very damn second. and in between it all, you stumble upon treasures and glimpses into a life you know you want, where you are happy and calm and relaxed, but most importantly, at peace.   my auditions were last night and they went pretty good i think. choosing at the very last minute to do a familiar favorite instead of the piece i'd been working on for the last few weeks, finding confidence within and even maybe my voice. i was nervous as heck, gritted my teeth and smiled, and somehow made it through. pretty damn well too apparently.   i have a callback tonight, and it'll be a good thing because oddly enough, the boyfriend doesn't need to be at work (surprise! surprise!) and is going to go with me.   the last couple of weeks have really been one of those things where you break or make a relationship, not seeing each other for months, his mom getting sick, moving, the stress, school, my auditions, his movie, his work, my work, the dog, the cat, the family, our schedules, trying to stay sane, living in four different houses, me getting sick, me going crazy, me trying very hard, him trying even harder, us trying hard together and it's been insane as hell to say the least.   there's a different way he touches me now, and it's not something you really physically understand, just a sense of feeling that elevates the place you're both in. it's this strange thing called love.   and i love it when he whispers i love you as i'm falling asleep.  or the way he is constantly holding me, touching me, kissing me, smiling...it's so fucking disgustingly adorable.   or thrift store shopping and never agreeing on any furniture then finding something we both like.   i am comfortable, and oddly enough, i'm beginning to think that things might be okay.  that everything might be okay.  i found a whole disc full of pictures from the summer the other night downloading stuff into the computer, and it was strange, funny, weird, fucking weird, but good. we sat and laughed through pictures of jae and i together, reminiscing and fuck yeah she and i look cute together.   i talked to jae the other night, and i know she comes in here. like they all do, and they all take peeks into my world inside, and sometimes it's hard, sometimes you don't know what to say...how do i explain the summer? do i miss her? yes, very much so, but she has someone else and so do i. i don't know how to explain it, perhaps it's decisions, perhaps it's just knowing that you're with someone you want to be with for a long long time. and it's hard for me to admit that, he has to practically hold a knife up to my neck for me to say the dreaded words 'forever'. but i do think about it.   every so often.  it's strange to have someone so supportive, someone who you know really believes in you.   this thursday i go in to the doctor's and to say i'm pissingly afraid is an understatement. the other dad wants to take me there and i really don't know how i'm going to handle anything if anything comes. ryan has the day off (again!) which means a lot to me because whatever the results, i want him to be there with me. i am scared and calm at the same time, it might all be nothing, and if it is anything, i'm a big girl and i'll be right.   there are so many things to think about. i talked to mom the other day, trying to constantly decide between staying and going, and she says i should stay here for treatment if anything, and i was thoroughly surprised at her decision. there's been a lot of stress lately, from trying to decide when to graduate, to what school i'm going to, to deciding my goals in life, to just wanting to make it through the next few months, next few years even.  but it's been good. i go in to see the head doctor tomorrow, and it feels as if there are so many issues but none at all.   what's going to happen to everyone and anyone and everybody?  i don't know, and right now, it seems silly but i don't really care.   i just want to enjoy life.   and be in love.   and sing to the trees.  and be eighteen.  :)    urlLink  "and no-one would give a pair of donkey's kidneys, as it very much should be."

      day light breaks on a tangle of bodies in the back porch. the 'florida room' they call them, where we have laid out a bed, some sheets, the mini fridge and candles in our screened in haven. away from everything, in the middle of nothing.  at one with the stars and the beauty of the universe, making love to the faded sounds of the night and the freshly awakened sounds of the morning.   s  l o w.  thenfastfastfaster.  and  s l o w  a g a i n.   he watches me dress in the morning, under the covers, away from the sunlight; hiding.   he whispers and nuzzles my ear, holding me tight...and i shiver.  ....and it's not just from the cold.   ----  he's off to see his mom, and i sit at home waiting.  cleaning up.  doing proper girlfriend shit that proper girlfriends do.  and he comes home with a gamut of emotions.   it must be hard, a dozen roses sit in a vase.   he envelops me with feelings that i want so badly to transcribe into words.   like being needed and needing.   comforting.    ---- moving, packing, putting bits and pieces and months of people, and a person, and life into cardboard boxes and sealing them tight.   renting u-hauls and driving up and down, back and forth. lugging a hot tub hooked onto the back of the trailer...into the big pretty backyard with the wide expanse deck.   a week left.   and every now and then, he looks at me from across the room and mouths, "i love you,"  and his sister laughs.   his cousin smiles.   his aunt and mom gossip.   we collapse together at the end of the night to bits and pieces of everything and emptiness but it is enough.   ---  moving, and everthing seems filled and disarrayed at once.

      some nights you pray for sleep to come and never leave. like bouts of paranoia and depression, it hits you like concrete bricks knocking you over, flung with the capacity of killing from a seventy story avant garde building shaped after a bamboo in a cosmopolitan city.  and you begin to wonder what death must feel like, back here almost certainly, failing yourself and the ones around you; you've given up already, yet the actual action of life sucked out of you has begun but once again, like everything you are, a complete utter bloody disgust.  a comparison of the she-devil in your mind, and every word pierces through the soul like old, rusty, bluntly sharp as ever knives. but you're all bled out, and all semblances of breath and humanity seems to shirk away. your middle name should be medea, you are midas in reverse. everything you touch crumbles and falls beneath you.  you useless fucking piece of shit.  and i cry.  i cry out to someone and everyone and nobody at all.  i want to run, run, run and never return.  i want to hide just a little while, beneath these safe arms that will hold me but i can't trust myself, i can't seem so let myself go.  and i suck ass.  up the medication to 60 mg, all the drugs from the treatment, and the shots, and the transfusions, and the hormones, and everything that's possibly fucked up about this body is angering the demons in my head. they return much more vicious than ever; this time shrinking me smaller and smaller into bits and pieces that i am convinced will never be repairable.  he wants to hold me tonight, and i crumble into so many pieces but i feel so numb. it's as if the pain just envelops and bubbles it all in. i want to share, i want to tell him so many things....like how much i'm hurting, like how everything feels so wrong, like the mania and the depression is a runaway train at full speed with no brakes(breaks) and i can feel it cominng, coming, coming and i am scared, and i am panicked and i am absobloodylutely terrified.  and he holds me close.  and he holds me tight.  i am sick.  i am sick on the couch, in the trashcan, dry heaving in the bathroom and crying on the bed.  so  fucking  out  of   control.  there's something about bullimia and being comfortable with the puking and something so fucking terrifying of losing control, and having absolutely no control of your body at all, or how it works, or what the hell is wrong with it.  but i just sit here pathetically and cry, cry like there is no tommorow. cry like i don't know who i am, cry like i'm scared of myself and so fucking disappointed. cry like a little child sobbing and sobbing and sobbing.  and this whole other part of me, this part, the strength, the whole part of racheal that used to be so happy, so determined, so fucking everything has gone away. and i've felt bits slip away with the years gone by and now i am nothing. i am a recluse of emptiness and emotionally fucked in the head, in the heart, in the body, in the soul. i am one fucked up little child.  and i want to scream and scream and scream forever.  inaudible incoherent sentences consume me, and i feel so weak. so weak from the throwing up, so weak from the medication, so weak from thinking and feeling and crying, and so i just fall.  and he catches me.  he cries.  and i don't mean to make him cry, i don't mean to let anyone see me this way but he's here, he's always here, and he keeps on seeing me, and keeps on unlayering, and keeps on holding me and i still want to run. i still want to be independent and cynical but i need him.  i need his security.  i need to listen to his voice soothe me, calm me the fuck down from hyperventilating and panicking, and just plain old losing it.  i need him to change my bandages, and wipe up the blood, and do the dishes and hold me to sleep, and protect me.  i need him to go scream at the crazy administration people to get me an appointment right. now.   or put my pills together in the morning, hold me up for 30 minutes, 8 oz of clear fluid, 8 oz of milk, and fiure out everything between because i am so useless and i so fucking bastardy.  how can you still want to make love to someone's that so disgustingly ugly and painful to look at?  how can you still get in bed at night and hold me, and stroke me, and tell me you love me?  how can you still want to spend the rest of your life with someone who fucks up constantly, who's so fucking useless she's not really worth keeping around on earth, how can you still be here?  and it hurts him to see me hurt.  and i try so hard to hide it from him.  i try so hard to only cry when i know he's sleeping.  or smile when it hurts.  but he knows.  he knows every damn bloody thing.  and it's frustrating.  and i'm frustrated.  tired.  giving up.  harnessing.  just trying to keep it together.   i love you so, so much.     urlLink "Sometimes a song, the breeze, the sound of the wind chimes and the smell of incense could still make me feel light and weightless inside, the girl who was a teenage witchbaby. But more often than not I just wish I could fall asleep and not wake up. And all I really want is to be a witchbaby again. All I want is to feel infinite one more time. "

      i sat at the porch tonight, watching the brilliantly scary display of crashing lightning and thunder. synchronizing the pounds of gallons and gallons of rain splashed onto to pavement, the heavy continous rhythms of torrenting rain drops on the roof....and i hate thunder. i hate lightning.   i'm a fucking terrified pussy when confronted with such uncertainty, when letting go to allow the universe to take control.   but something drew me so strongly to it tonight.  i can't find my camera charger, i don't have my lap top cable, the transfer programs are on ryan's, blogger pro is shutting down, chris is on leave, jikon's taken a sabbatical, i am questioning and so fucking nauseous....the world seems to be spinning too fast and not shaking enough.  i use the back of my hand to put out my ciggarette. and the first layer of my skin burns off with the glowing ash i've pressed into it. my white flesh beneath it makes an appearance....and i wonder why i don't bleed.   it doesn't hurt, not much anyway. i'm on enough of painkillers to jump off a sixty seven foot building and still not feel the pain. something inside is stirring awake and i am in a labyrinth spinning around in circles and coming out at every available dead end.   i have homework to do, so much pressure to succeed. i miss my mom and dad, i miss my brother, i miss grandma and my family. they're over in singapore for the weekend, and i can't help but feel the maid has taken my spot. she went with them, and i am a million miles away wishing that i all i could do tonight was curl in with my parents on their bed and fall asleep. and feel safe. and be at peace.  it's the mooncake festival back at home. and i remember when we were younger, everything it signified and how we'd light up the garden leaving trails of candle wax on every available surface. burning at least one paper lantern if we were lucky but feeling so much pride at the end of the night, when everything fell into place and was so perfect. when my cousins and i ran around and squealed delightedly, when the adults gathered at the porch and overlooked us playing. and the whole place would be warm in a yellow glow of chinese paper lanterns, little candle sticks, and smiling faces.   peeling away only the outside and never liking the different insides that were mushy like peas. or the different animals on the lunar calendar that came as cookies in little plastic woven baskets tied together.  i miss home.   i'm beginning to think that i'm beginning to forget what baby isabel smells like, or if my granpa still likes the same brand of tea because people change you know. i'm afraid that while i am growing up and changing and maturing here that i miss out on the important things that mean so much to them. like forgetting the little things. like wanting a hug from the kids. like blogger meets that are tantalizingly chaotic.  selfishly, some part of me is so relieved to be back. it's quiet here, and when i want i can take a swim at the bay...play with the dolphins and ducks and mullets. or take a boat ride. or drive into town and watch the local bands play at the cafe downtown.   and there's always a church open anyday, anytime. always a service for possibly anything and everything. of coming back to some place i used to know and i swear i want to get to know again....but it just takes time. and accceptance. of holding hands in the back of the church with some stranger from another part of the world, or another tourist and saying the lord's prayer and marvelling at how sometimes the world seems so beautifully connectingly small.  but most of all, i like how i can slip into the shadows. be absolutely invisible, yet i hate how fucking alone it makes me feel.  to want this so much but crave for ups and downs at the same time. for the thrills, the amazing highs and bouts of mania, the crashing, falling, weeping pain of losing grip on reality and coming to terms with yourslef.  i'm really okay, and if i have to think about, i'm doing much better than i expected to be...but then again, i've always been miss superwoman so well. yeah.  but it's alright.  i'm going to be okay.  i'm okay.    hugs

          some nights you swallow your fears and choke back the tears...yet some nights, you just let it all rip apart and crash on you. falling freely with the ground caving in beneath you into an oblivion somewhere. a destination, a journey, an endeavor of hope, trust, heartache, confusion and slaying your dragons, silencing your demons.    she wakes up in morning grogginess, the bright red light of the digital clock beside her reads the breaking of early dawn. she tosses and turns, willing herself to return to the other world, willing herself to escape reality for another hour, another couple of minutes. willing to escape.    you think about the parentless children around, the little five year old that needs a heart...that wavers in between. a beautiful symphony of life and smiles stripped away.....just letting precious minutes waste by, waiting. waiting for another five year old kid somewhere else to journey to heaven, so he can finally have a healthy heart. so he can finally do five year old things. like play in the sand, and tag the dog, and chase after soapy liquid bubbles on the boardwalk. so he finally run, and dance, and spin around.     fumbling around for her lenses, knocking over herself a couple of times as jarring pain envelopes her. she falls back and curls into a fetal position, desperately crying. so fucking alone.     remnants of nine-eleven come and gone again. second time around and yet life has rushed by and remained in a standstill. a roomful of strangers of every ethnicity, of every gender preference, of every religion and of every background crowd in a little park nearby. lighting candles, joining hands, shedding tears, saying prayers.   yes, the pain is still there.     she peels back layers and works so hard. she tires herself endlessly with school, with friends, with the partner, with the head doctor, with her meds, with her parents....she tires herself in trying to remain sane. or at least some semblance of it. she wears herself out being normal.....and she is tired.   again.    the terror of the day a nation fell apart and joined together. a day that signifies the world begging for humanity.   i swallow it down, but suddenly everything is so overwhelming and it all just seems too much to deal with at once.   ....and i wonder if this is the ride back down again?  but i don't want to watch the rollercoaster on the sideline, i want to fall and scream and yell and live.   i want justice, and fairness.   i want equality and understanding.   i want to save someone.  i want to be someone.  i want to hold something.  i want to paint a picture.  i want to sing a song.  i want to smell the trees and play in the rain.  i want to reach out and hold your hand.   i want this world to be smaller, closer....nicer.   maybe.  someday.  maybe...      urlLink  "It's the children's voices that make this so much harder.

          being awake for twenty sum hours on painkillers, caffiene and nicotine is definitely detrimental to the soul.      urlLink  "Driving to work today, I glanced over at her lithe presence in the passenger seat. She'd kicked off her sandals and folded herself into an accordion shape, knees mashing into boobs, adorable bare feet up on the dashboard. Her head was tilted at an appraising angle and a slender arm reached around her legs, painting her toenails a glittery opalescent silver. A beautiful girl in a beguiling moment, phasing from the familiar to unfamiliar and back again. I feel like I've been with her forever. I feel like we're just beginning."

       long fucking ass post "summed up" in ten points.        i. blogger is a fuckturd.   they shut me up for a whole fucking damn ten days!   ii. blogger is amazing.   thank you tech-support.   iii. i'm being tested for cervical cancer. whoop dee doo dah!     "the world is a funny paper read backwards, and that way ain't funny,"   so this is this week's drama.  and i seem so nonchalant i know,  but maybe i'm in shock.  maybe i'm just used to it.  maybe, i don't know, just maybe.   maybe it is nothing.  maybe it's just an infection.  maybe the slides she examined weren't mine.  lets just harbor on maybe, it's the second anniversary of 9/11, and i still have hope.   i'm going to be okay.  i'm going to be alright.  because i'm a fucking fighter, because i will make it, because i'm just good like that.     iv. be grateful for what you have and what you don't have.   ever notice how extremely fucking far buildings are on campus when you're on heels and you have ten minutes to get into class?  and this is going to sound so wrong, but pap smears are so fucking disgustingly painful, stupid, and retarded.   how is it that the answer to everything is sticking something up you, poking around, and aggravating an already equally aggravated thing?  blech.   blech.   pooi.     v. my question was if you missed me and not if i was pregnant.   but just for the record, HELL NO! and i was puking like tap water this morning so that was the first thing that came to mind. (thank you depo-provera)   vi. why in the goddamn hell am i so cheery?!?!    vii. we had a quiet night of getting stoned on homemade magaritas and 'fruitful' conversation the other night. maybe i'm all talked out, or as we learn in psychology. in fucking denial.   really though,  how many damn times have i watched this movie?  change already!    viii. to the one that completes me, and lets me complete him ;     so often i know it's crazy. so many parts of us, so many different experiences and meanings to us are derived from other people, other pictures from other places in our lives. our past sometimes knowingly, sometimes unacceptingly twined into us and now.   "we do good together, you and me...or i...well, you know,"  and there is so much left in between that stands preciously and precociously to be unravelled.   waits to be explored.  pussy whipped and all things great.  little things, silly things, that suddenly, crazily fall into place.  with time.  with learning.  with ups and downs and lefts and rights and befores and nows.  but eight months later, going on nine...we are still together.   stronger than ever, more vulnerable than anything.   but i love you.   and love can be so many things and nothing at once.   the tears you cry from a whisper, a touch, a breath of silence on thin pulses..  three simple complex words.   i whisper, i scream, i bellow.   wipe away, it's okay silly, we're okay.  i have you.  and you have me.   welcome home, sexykins.  welcome home, luv.  we made it through summer.  ......even if i break.  even if i fall again.  even if i scrape my knees, break my neck and never walk again.   or so i say.   now.  or so i do,  now.  or so i want to be,  now.   and now is everything.   and everything is now.   building, rebuilding, tearing down, mending.   and a whole lot of loving.   :P  i feel your breath on my skin, and and you move deep inside me, beneath where skin on skin touches, you touch me right there.   and i am at a crossroad again.    reaching for your hands that beckon my way.   looking in your eyes that gently guide your soul.  we celebrate an anniversary...and you hesssitantly spurt out 'i love you' in my language.   my laughter fills the air, rumbles in my lungs.   i love you too, silly.  i love you.   thank you for being there, here, in my life.    ix. if the social life and medicine doesn't kill you, the homework will.   5 papers and a presentation to finish THIS weekend.   x. and lastly, to sum up everything and anything, life is like a dick, when it's hard, you fuck it.    :P    have a great weekend y'all!  hugs, love and peace.   (i want  hugs  all three damnit!)  oh come on, humor the dying bitch will ya?   :P    urlLink  "But, i think, if there were more hours in the day, then there would be no sense of urgency."

           i've found out.. that the reason i believe is because there are people to inspire me everyday.  and thoughts, and pictures, and seeing the world a little bit different from my sometimes rose colored glasses aren't too bad.  that while my perception of things are admittedly rather dramatic, they are also sensitive.   while i panic in the middle of the night and toss around through restless dreams of insecurity and indecision, that in the end, i am who i want to be and i'll be whatever that's meant to be.   i sat through my technical lab class today, an hour and half long of lectures and constant brickbats of having to come back with something smart to the other five burly guys in my class. defending the little asian girl that's playing with the power tools, building the set, and figuring out the light management.  i have as much heart, as much commitment, and as much perseverance as you fuckers damnit.   so i prance around in my stillettos, and take my bundle of work clothes and tennis shoes, albeit, they are red and white with plastic stripes and rather funky to say the least. and strip my jewelry, and slap a baseball cap on, and tie my hair up, and prove my worth.   the wolf whistles, the constant fending off of people staring at your breasts (what breasts?) and making snide comments.   but i am like the rest of the guys, a little bit different in shape, a little bit different in size, but special in a whole lot of other ways.  and that is truly kinda nice.   and that is truly kinda special.  :)  signs you're in redneckville geriatric town.  going to the annual mullet festival and tossing fish the furthest, target shooting, and being served hush puppies.   how's my day going?  great really. (and that's SCARY!)  a lot of pressure to succeed, but i'm going home for christmas.  and suddenly the mere thought of getting on a plane and returning home is a lovely feeling.   that simultaneous calls from the hungarian goddess and barker put a grin on my face minus the odd instance when the colliding weirdness of barker and her discussing how i taste was just weird beyond strange.   but then again, things are always a little catastrophically different and strange around here anyway.   somebody put up a bid to buy my pictures the other day. and so i spent most of the weekend putting together an attempt of somewhat organizing my portfolio. and it was good money too.  but it wasn't the money, nor anything else that i really cared about.  it was that for those brief moments, i believed in myself and saw what i could do and what i could be and what i was made of.   that while i passed by stan today he hugged me as a friend and not as a director and made my skanky ass damn bloody try out for the auditions in three weeks.   because someone believed in me.  because someone thought i could do it.   and last night, it all dawned on to me that even with the 18 credits, the movie shoot, the set work and the musical preparations....that i might be able to do it.   that i might be worth something.  that i might be special after all.  or just for the next few minutes at least.  or just for a little while more.      urlLink  "And you are sad because it has been so long and so loud and so lonely. In this brief moment of clarity you realize what you have missed. All this time you thought you just couldn't grasp it, it was too far away, but it was right in front of your face and you couldn't hear it. "

      tori amos and ani difranco interchanges between wafts of stale cigarette haze and dying souls. no more politics, or talk of things that pains my heart so. another anniversary looms, but the hurt, fear, pandemonium still remains.   a photo exhibition set up, a shoot prepared...cameras aimed and ready to capture, to elaborate, to draw into the innermost chambers of an unknown spirit and find faith.  labor day weekend, of tornading hurricanes and humid summer nights.   of wanting to be free, alone in the dark, dancing naked in the warm bay waters crystally emerald clear and the white sand beaches. beneath the bright twinkling stars, beneath everything that seems so surreal and perfect and wrong all at once.   granpa says i love you.  an emerging familiarness in a crowd of faces. of strangers and things you used to know but can't remember now. Of memories you'd like to tap into but cannot find, cannot sink(drown) into.  the seduction of emptiness cascades the immediate need for something, for anything.   just anything at all...but nothing at the same time.  indecision and the constant pressure that pounds and locks you in.  what are the demons that drive you into this oblivion?  you watch the mullets leap around you and the waves crash and float surrounding you. the salty immersion of tears and sea water, the bouyancy of too much weight(fat) on your shoulders(body).  you feel invinsible, and no one really listens at all.  you are the cute girl in the class, the friend of everyone, the believer of everything.  you are nobody.  you are nothing.  i miss you malaysia, i miss you certainty, i miss you everything i used to know and don't know at all.  i miss you understanding.   i miss you happiness.   and normal-ness.  i miss you, me.      urlLink  "A howl crescendos, deafening, but it drowns out the groans of these ancient pillars.

         someone asked me the other day what it is to be normal....and i honestly didn't know the answer.  normal now isn't like it used to be.  normal is now comprised of panic attacks, or episodes of mania. normal is now crying myself to sleep, or wanting to hurt myself. normal is now letting everyone down and starving myself. normal is now going at a hundred miles an hour on a ride that takes you nowhere.   it's that feeling you get that you're letting everyone around you down, or that you are just a big fat pain in the ass. it's the dissappointment and anger towards yourself, it's that hopelesness in the middle of the night, middle of the day.  it's looking at the ones around you and knowing deep inside that they deserve so much better.  it's coming in here and writing a stupid entry to strangers, it's coming in here and hoping to write it all out and achieving nothing at all.  it's coming in here and having a good cry, only that there is nothing good about it. except that you are losing it, and some part of you cackles and mocks you. laughs at you again.  what bloody made you think you deserve to be here anyway?  do you think that if anyone ever saw you inside they'd love you?  hell no bitch.  and you know that by hard.   so sometimes you tell yourself to just die already.  and sometimes you just give up.   sometimes, you just want it all to end.     you are nothing.

           took this last night out at the beach watching the sun go down. there's something about this picture that makes me tear up and calm down at the same time, i don't know if it was because of the many things i felt while taking it or if it is the simpleness in it.   it's strange to be alive.       urlLink  "The last paragraph. Suddenly there's so much I want to say. Things I want to remember, all those blog posts I began but never finished. People I need to thank for their kindnesses, for sharing in return. Goodbyes and more goodbyes. I wish I didn't have to go. But this is a happy ending. Not the happy ending I would've written for myself when I started this blog two years ago, but life is full of surprises. Even a plain life like mine.  Take very good care of you."

      they discharged me, it's sorta odd to get back into routines and things.  ---  i'm currently pissed at shredder @ the escape artist @ let's piss and shit everywhere @ the not so silent dog.  mr smarty-pants just about gave me a heart attack...i had him in the back part of the living room and had our doors wide open to let the wonderful cool night breeze in, but mr. dog, the brilliant fucker that he is, found out a way to escape and comes charging, and i mean charging, out, jumping all over me. bear in mind we live in a corner house, and bear in mind that our street interconnects with 9th, and bear in mind it is a busy ass road.   so in a state of panic, hysteria and madness...i scream.  fuck me.   pah...still love the damn fucker though.   ---  i'm doing better for what it's worth. we went out to the beach to watch the sunset tonight...the bad thing about not being in alabama anymore is that the bay isn't in my backyard, the good thing about being in pensacola though is that the beach is about 10(?) minutes away or so. sweet hell yeah.   well, that and having someone to come home to every night.   :)  ---  we were at the c.s.u today, and it was the first time i was in the front reception area. that was some strange feeling...all these metal detectors, people searching up your crack and shit..and the guy up front says, see how much he loves you?  he came every night, and sometimes even at strange hours to bring me stuff i needed. even if visiting hours were over and i didn't get so much of a glimpse of him. we were driving home, and he stops to say, i love you so so much racheal.   he pulls me close to make sure i'm warm...and kisses my wounds. he worries, then worries somemore. making sure they check this and that, that and this.   am i still kinda in the funk?  yeah, a little. it gets depressing sometimes, it's so weird to be in touch with reality again.   you're holed up for a couple of days and it's strange to pull into your driveway. or think about what to make for dinner. or even just to breathe in and out the smells of something familiar. something you know. it's strange to go back to your life, to go back to being racheal khong, to go back to writing and school and learning and trying. it's strange to return to 'normalacy'.  --  i sit here typing this, blogging...something so simple. something so easy for me to do, bitch about life, hate myself, say what's wrong. and part of me still wants to sob like a little girl, and part of me is just strangely serene. not an absolute calmness but just more of a blank. like where the hell did my whole entire week go? or what is going on inside of me? or even just something as easy as where do i go from here?  i want to thank all of y'all that mailed me. that sent flowers. that stopped by just to say hie. for a hug. for all of y'all that made me smile, that said it was okay. i wanted to say thank you, and thank you again.   i was...very scared, i think i still am. perhaps some part of me will always be. afraid of the world, afraid of me, afraid of life.   my schedule is jam packed from trying to pick up things from where i left them. i have rehearsals every night as we lead towards our opening in a couple of weeks, i have homework and assignments from school, i have laundry to do, emails to return, sorries to apologize. for drifting away, for trying to take my life, for not being strong enough, for just being me. six thousand appointments to meet, two on wednesday and friday when we find out the results from the biopsies they took two weeks ago. it's hard to imagine that that was two weeks ago isn't it?  it's hard to imagine how life has moved on, and changed, and stood still at the same time.  it's hard to be stuck in the same body, but to go through a spectrum of emotions. to have a myriad of thoughts.   how do you convince yourself that suicide isn't the answer? and if you don't, how do you deal with being a failure. yes, a failure even at taking your life.   i think you're going to laugh at that one. it's the here we go again ride. and maybe i'll never be okay with myself, never be really proud of me. and i know you're going through some shit of your own right now, fuck me for even making any reference to you eh? but i read through what you said, and i recognized that insecurity. that i hate the world and the world hates me, yet i also knew that little part inside that still said, i'm okay damnit. i'm fine. i am alright. i have every damn bloody right to be here. you're a good person,and yes, you are okay, you're alright. and maybe some day we'll both learn to love ourselves. or something to that effect anyway. i'm here if you ever need anything, and that goes out to anyone that reads this, i know i may not be much but if you need someone to talk to, bitch at, compare shitty lives with(i win!) or just play scrabble with. i'm here.   hugs.  take care all.   thank you again.      "I thought of you today and prayed that you were feeling better. I felt fresh tears on my cheeks, as I thought of you there---alone, in need, unable or unwilling to reach out---as your life started to fade away. Thank God they came in time.   I want to tell you that I’m here for you and that I am not mad at you. It’s not your fault. Sometimes the pain seems too much to possibly bear… I remember how that felt. I want to reach out for you and silently hug you tight. I’d like to say I know what you are going though but that wouldn’t be correct, no one knows that but you, however I can say that I understand. Possibly more than you will ever realize.   As I sit here I find myself looking at a mental scrapbook of the years you have been in this world. Years that I have known you. Your bright, quick smile. Your brilliant mind. Your natural beauty. I can only smile. Our lives have been enriched simply by your being in them.   I know the tunnel is dark right now and there doesn’t seem to be a way out. I know that everyone in your life is telling you about all that you have, all that you are, and what the future can hold for you so I’m not going to. It’s not my place. It’s yours. Eventually you will find your inner voice and this voice will begin to teach you. I only ask that you at least try to hear it out.  Just remember that this is about moods, about emotions, about feelings. It’s not who, or what, you are. It’s a thing, something that can be addressed, treated if not cured. Give yourself that chance. Please don't walk away without a fight.  Reba"      urlLink  "I need mental help. I know I do. "

      i wrote something absolutely profoundly stupid the other night.   i thought i'd share that with you.  it went along the lines of a cherry and toe nails.    "cherry, cherry, line my toenails,"  (???)  i suppose pretty good signs that the sanity was going.   it's an interesting thing to be in the 'crisis stabilization unit'.  even funkier to be woken up at six every morning for vitals and bloodwork.  .....the last couple of days have been rough, good though; i'm supposed (trying) to view this positively. getting off my meds wasn't exactly the smartest thing to do, even more underlined when you're locked in, baker acted, and have an increasing medical bill to boot. i have bruises from where they've continually drawn blood from, tired wankingly weak legs, a broken body, a faltering though system, and the extremes one mind takes you to.   i am not good, or great...but i'm okay.  the psych techs on this unit is excellent...i am comforted and somewhat secure. a little bit more sane and rested than the couple of weeks leading into this.   it's still a sad place though. heartbreaking really, i spend almost every waking moment caged in with the other patients (or as pc america likes to call them, "clients") that have lost their mind, on the way to losing their mind, or are just about to.   and i wonder what the hell i am doing here.   or which category i fit into.   why so many people sick? why so much hurting?  ...emergency rooms are scary places to be.   the early crack of dawn, being asked seventeen thousand things and not being there at the same time. smiling faces, crying hearts, delusional dying depressed fucking up you.   the boyfriend holds the puke bucket where black vomit continuosly comes out. he gets water, another blanket, the nurses. he holds your hand and assures you it's okay, he spends twenty hours holding you, wiping you, stroking your hair, talking to the doctors, assuring the parents. he takes the role of someone that you know for a fact now genuinely loves you. cares.   he sings this to you as you fall in and out,   "Let's Stay Together Al Green  (Al Green - Willie Mitchell - Al Jackson)   I, I´m so in love with you  Whatever you want to do  Is all right with me  ´Cause you make me feel so brand new  And I want to spend my life with you   Since, since we´ve been together  Loving you forever  Is what I need  Let me be the one you come running to  I´ll never be untrue   Let´s, let´s stay together  Lovin´ you whether, whether  Times are good or bad, happy or sad   Whether times are good or bad, happy or sad   Why, why some people break up  Then turn around and make up  I just can´t see  You´d never do that to me (would you, baby)  Staying around you is all I see  (Here´s what I want us to do)   (repeat to fade):  Let´s, we oughta stay together  Loving you whether, whether  Times are good or bad, happy or sad"   and you wonder how you ever got so lucky, and you wonder why he stays, and you wonder why he still tells you you're beautiful in a horrendous green gown, an ashen face, and tubes stuck everywhere.   a diastolic heartbeat, falling blood pressure, sticky tapemarks on your chest, your tummy, your arms from the monitors.   yet you know nothing and everything that's going on around you.  you want to block out the last few days.  and every night, as highs and lows tie in together and closure to another day comes; you crash. so pill happy c.s.u. feeds you another tranquilizer and anti-anxiety medicine, and they threaten to give you a shot if you don't at least attempt to digest this little green pill.   you cry, you cry so hard you hyperventilate, you cry so hard you are in your own world, you cry so hard you never stop.   and every hour, they let you out of the locked rooms, in the still caged facility, to the tiny garden to get some sunshine. or breathe in some fresh air. or freeze your butts off. they take the strings off your pants and hoods, they take away anything that might possibly harm you, even your pen, even your sanity.   they say they're just trying to keep you safe.   just trying to keep you alive.   they have groups around the hour, but you just sit in the corner and weep. or cry. or just stay silent, watch the others...everyone in here feels the need to talk about how they feel, struggle for attention, yet you are still alone in that you're the only one that feels safe yet wants to get the fuck out of here at the same time.  up by six, bed by ten thirty. restricted, regimented, everything is planned. noted.   at 4:45, racheal sat on the bench.  at 4:50, she watched tv.  at 5:00, she had mash potatoes for dinner.   yes, even what you eat. what you hear. what you say.   and someday, maybe when you're bettern, you'd like to look at those charts, yet some day, you hope you never ever see them. read them. know how absolutely fucked up you are.   i am afraid, and scared.   i am pressured, and piss fucking frustrated.   i am getting better, and doing fine.   i am in a fucking damn crisis unit.  i don't want to live.   but i want so badly to see my rainbow.       in.  between.     death is a s l o w,   s   l   o  w,  agonizing process.     "just try, try, then try again,"

      so to whoever the smart person that discovered that when you covered an area with a vinegar solution, the abnormal cells would turn white....fuck you.  because after that they take a biopsy of it, in which i had three samples taken, one which gave me shitty cramps, and two other that required cutting of a portion of it.   think vinegar on a freshly cut open wound.   exactly.  five people in a much too tiny room is a little too claustrophobic for me.   and i don't think the blood circulation has returned to ryan's fingers yet.  the procedure was this morning and i just woke up six hours later, very very sucky.   i am in pain and i'm cranky.

(we still don't have a name!!)   for the roses, the flowers, the i can't even pronounce the fucking thingamabob for our dinner party, for always looking out for me.   for driving me and picking me up for school, and rehearsals, and the once in a while visits to bum fuck alabama and everywhere i need to go in between.   for the master bedroom, the walk in, the full fledged his and hers bathroom, for building the bar, helping me make this place mine.   for excursions and surprises. for hiding me and having six thousand and seven people "protect" me from finding out the "big plan".  for the fireworks display(!) and stopping by god knows where to get them.   for talking to my mom, and trying to understand my culture, for learning chinese and malay and crazy stupid english words i mispronounce all the time.   for saying saya sayang padamu at the most absurd times.   for having pillow fights, and tickling matches.   for elmo cookies and downloading all my chinese, malay, spanish, god knows what songs.    i could go on and on and on, you bring so much joy, so much happiness, so much peace into my life. i don't even know where to begin and i think that even if i tried, i wouldn't do it justice.   thank you most of all, for LOCKING ME UP IN THE COMPUTER ROOM (!!!) because you have to 'set things up'?   :P  i can't wait to spend the rest of the forbidden f with you.   i love you sexykins.   i swear this is the craziest birthday ever....and it's only been two hours!!!!!!  :)  :)  :)   p/s well, okay, an hour and fifty four minutes but hey, who's counting?  p/p/s you are one crazy fuck. :P  p/p/p/s thank you, thank you, thank you.   so very very much.   :)  terima kasih baby!  :)

      crashing. an hour ago i was high as a kite, excited about the new layout, rambling, smiling, then it all fell down. i fell down, and my tummy hurts, and i'm bleeding again.  i started crying, and now i can't stop. and i'm sobbing and sobbing and sobbing and everything hurts all at once and it feels like i am going crazy and a fucking terrified out of my mind. i'm afraid, i'm pissingly scaringly fuckingly afraid. i am just another shit terrified loser who's really just taking up space, it feels so wrong in here sometimes. i feel so wrong.   i turn nineteen in three days and for some odd reason, i am so unhappy. i am sad.   i call my mom and dad, and cry on the phone and ask them what's wrong. and beg to know why i can't stop, and beg to know what's going on in my body, why it's all fucked up and why is god so angry with me. and my mom tells me stories of when i was little, hoping to cheer me up, hoping to give me hope. she tells me of how i was so full of life when i was younger, she tells me about how i was always on top, and everyone loved me, and i was always so happy, and such a good kid. and every word she says pierces even harder, because i am a dirty ugly disgusting hopeless stupid child now. i hate me.   i am confused, and i shouldn't be. i am sad, but i have so much to be grateful for. i am fucked up and i am so angry. i am angry with myself, i am angry at the world, i am angry that i saw an old man walking home alone today and that hurt me, i am angry because i watched 25th hour and they had the tribute to ground zero, and i couldn't help but think that someone's mommy and daddy and koko and poppi and baby died there. died there because some motherfucker decided to be god. and i am angry at god. angry because i have no one else to be angry at, angry because i am angry with me.   i have this fear, this big great black wad of fear in me. there's so much i want to do in life, but sometimes i am so tired. and sometimes, i am so afraid i stop thinking and look for immediate escape, i suck at that but somehow, i am still afraid that one day i will finally succeed and it will be accidental. that i don't really want to die, i just want to escape being me a while. i just want to be okay, and breathe, and smile.   someone help me.  someone tell me everything's going to be okay.   i'm in alabama tonight. so far away, so disconnected from everything.  i am lonely.  i am alone.  i am sick an i am fucked and i've stopped taking all my medication because i don't think they'll ever work. and maybe that's why i'm feeling shitty tonight, because i've been off my medication for a week now. because i turn nineteen on wednesday and i am so unhappy. i go in for a biopsy on friday and scope. where they slice you apart and dye you and take samples and cut off and do whatever the fuck they want to you. i am scared, i am sad, i am alone.   no one understands, and it's not they don't try, it's that i'm in too deep, too far down that no one can get me.   someone save me.  please?  still crying  still can't stop.  still hiding.   ryan gets off work in two hours, and i have to keep me from going insane is to tell myself again and again and again that killing myself wouldn't make it any better. that there are craszy stupid people that need me aorund here, that i can't just go. that goddamnit i have things to do and i am going to fight this dragon and i'm going to be okay.   i am so  stupid  one stupid fuck.   fuck me. fuck me. fuck me.  does anyone really read this shit?    ""I can do this. Nothing in my life matters except this moment. Nothing in the world matters except this moment. I was born for this moment, and if I fail in this moment. I will die in this moment"  -Raistlin Majere-"

       a while ago..   we spent the night in with homemade magaritas (extra tequila and salt), my grand concoction of leftover-steaks-turned-into-fajitas-turned-into-i've-had-a-long-day-at-school-so-it's-this-or-mc donald's and the whole she-bang of 'catch me if you can' for the six millionth time on telly.   i let him clean up because i'm good at whining like that but most nights he volunteers though. sometimes, we do the dishes together but the floor and our clothes probably get more 'cleaned' that the actual dishes themselves.   we were talking about our childhoods the other day, something along the lines of not really being a kid or having a childhood and taking all that for granted. living it up now, and i see a lot of that in us. or where we are in life now.   maybe we have more time to slow down and smell the flowers, not as much a pressing need to safe the world and grow up.   some nights we are children together discovering the treasures of life, blowing bubbles in our backyard and piggy back riding on the bay. some nights, i see him stripped of everything and i see the little guy within that still believes in faith and pixiedust. and i smile.  i smile because he makes me smile.   because he holds my hand in public and makes it seem as if i am so important.   i smile because he makes my dark world seem not so scary sometimes.   i smile because he comes out with the corniest shit and the most silly romantic surprises.   i smile because he completes me.  so the drinks were great, the sex fantastic and the curling to sleep with a warm body holding you the best.  he whispers in my ears, i love you so much, racheal.  and i nuzzle closer into him.   i close my eyes and relax.  breathe in, breathe out.   a little bit of armani mania, and sensi, our odd retarded indulgence of his and hers, plus a little bit more.   worn out, arms lazily over chests and legs tucked in together; i fall asleep wanting to remember this moment forever.   wanting to make those invisible picture memories to store in that old, tattered book for a rainy day.      it's a quarter to four in the morning right now and i am absobloodylutely awake.   and instead of being the rude bitch i normally am and making him entertain me, i thought i'd tap a post into the world to see how it was doing.  or how i was doing.  same difference.   :P

      so i slept in and had this great idea for my redesign together, it seemed to all piece together solidly, profoundly, in my little idealistic wannabe mind. there were splashes of sunny yellow, and different hues of colliding blues and blacks, shades of pinks and purples.   i emptied out the trash cans, and cleaned out the ash trays, wiped settling dust off table tops and danced alone in the cold of a newborn fall.  patiently, like waiting out the waves of nausea...or studying so hard your brains break apart for an exam, weaning off prozac, acting out a scene you know so fucking well because you've rehearsed it seven million times before.   and i thought, if only, what if.  but i know i can be, i am.   a survivor.   i  am  at  peace.  happy even.  :)

        happy thanksgiving y'all   it was special, in a very simple sort of way....the ways things should be i suppose. uncomplicatingly amazing. right down to our bubble bath, our abundance of food to last six lifetimes and as always, the excursions. watching a movie together, curled up in the arms of of someone i love and of someone that loves me. i still find for the words to describe it, the little big small huge things. it's in his eyes, in his touch. it's in the way he moves inside me, the way he says i love you, i need you, i want you.   peeling potatoes with the moms, baking with the cousins...no chaos, no screaming, no fights. nothing like last year, no bickering of the other parents. it was a nice thanksgiving indeed. no pressure to be perfect or anything at all, in my jammies just being me. just being a part of the family. this is what it's all about i want to scream, i want to cry, i want to thank the great big guy up above again.   he talks about our basement, what it's going to look like. and we plan out the little things, picking out furniture and deciding on schools and what-nots. what i'll do when we get there, what he'll do. planning holidays and summers, white christmases and joyful springs. the doctors, the hospitals, the psychiatrists, he's got it all worked out in his head, all the little pieces coming together...being pieced together.   and they both look so happy. going home. and i know that feeling only oh too well.   it's funny how much can happen when you put four brains together. a big thing, i suppose almost like getting married. our 2.5 kids and the dog. got the dog covered plus jessica and rob. this is so strange, i don't know if that this feels so right that it's strange or if it's because the whole concept of it all just amazes me. me?  there's this warmth when he's near. just this insane amount of love he radiates. this is what love truly is, and everyday, even as i wake up to arms flung on my chest and his breath tickling my ear i thank someone again. thank god for this gift. him. us.   i am only nineteen and him twenty and in the back of my mind i am constantly worrying. what if we're just kidding ourselves? what if it happens all over again? what if? what if? what if?   this just seems too perfect...and it's as if i'm waiting for it all to cave beneath me.   it's ironic how boringly in tune we are. honey, pick up some eggs on the way home. you never wear any bloody thing i buy so why bother? take the fucking dog out will you. you do the dishes and i do the laundry? ramen noodles, mac and cheese or mc donalds tonight?   i have all these hours in between school and when he comes home from work. and i clean, or organize, or humor myself...watch tv, paint, play scrabble as i wait for the magic hour. making dinner in between, trying to prevent it from getting cold, little surprises.   and he comes home with flowers and a smile.   and says hey baby, i missed you.   and i say i missed you too.   i missed you too.

           seasons changing...shaping up into things your heart and soul truly desires, the night before thanksgiving. going out to buy the perfect christmas tree, picking out tinsel and lights, lights from everywhere and anywhere spurting out your butt, purples and yellows, reds and blues, greens and whites. it's all so pretty, it's all so gay and you scream and jump up and down like a little girl. he says hop on my back, and he carries you up to place the star at the very top. all seven feet of it.   he smiles and whispers into your ear, leading you to dance to christmas grinch music, wrapping presents, making pies. life could be so perfect, life is so right, right now. here. together. us.   you want to cry and laugh and cry again. cry because it's so perfect, cry because it's so beautiful, cry because you're so damn blessed. he talks about your future, our future. we plan the move, and the house, and the everything in between.   it's like being lost for words but having so many similes to describe it. it's the i love you at intersections, it's the hugs that make you feel safe and secure, it's the talks in the middle of the night, it's the coming of two into one but still being your own person at the same time.   could i be this lucky?   coming home to a house of love, a home of us.   the fireplace, snow, the dog, the basement. dreams shaping up from absolutely nothing into everything. missouri, florida, kuala lumpur. here, us, now, this, everything.   and tomorrow the fmaily will sit at the table and the turkey will roast. the house bustling with activitiy, god there is so much to be thankful for. so much to just stop and say wow.   it's the realization that you're okay. that beneath all that's fucked up, beneath all that lies uncertain, unbalanced that there is hope. that this is a season of love and thanksgiving. that this is a season to accept.   it's strange to build your lives together. it's feels so damn out of place but right at the same time. the times your insecurity rears it's ass ugly face and says you're stupid. the times you don't want to think, or feel, or anything at all. but then there are the ones where he feeds you, and bathes you. where you're crying and sick and tired and he takes it all in with a smile. anything to make you feel better, anything to make you alright. it's the times you realize you are so in love with this man that you will do anything for him. it's the times you both laugh and cry together, it's the times i pull and he pushes, it's the times i encourage and he questions, it's the times we love together. discover.   thank you, someone, everyone for this. for everything that i am, can be, will be.   it's thanksgiving, and it's good to know that i have a list, that i have a prayer, that i have so much to thank for tonight, tommorow, the day after.   thank you mom and dad for invaluable advice. for the three in the morning hysteria, for still holding on, still pushinig forward. thank you for carrying out my hopes and dreams when i lost sight, thank you for all the hardwork, the physical labor, the emotional toil. i know it isn't easy having me as a daughter, but i sure as am ass thankful for having you guys as parents. i honestly don't think i'd ever make it this far without you guys. thank you for letting go and holding close. there are times i think i don't know how, or where. and it's ironic to think now that i truly trust your decisions, your judgement. thank you for giving me wings to fly, to soar, to fall, to touch. everything i have learned, i have learned from the both of you. of compassion, of forgiveness, of selflessness, of joy, of pain, of respect, of everything i know. i love you both so much and it's crazy to think of the things i've learned. thank you for being my best friends and my mom and dad at the same time.    koko, for tormenting me and giving me crap when i need it. for knocking reality into my mind and saying i can damn well fucking do it. for being someone i admire and look up to, for setting a good example, for playing with me. i keep your essay framed up to remind me of home, to remind me of all the love i have across the oceans when i'm alone. thank you for being my partner in crime, for talking to the parents when i'm being crazy or they're being crazy. for just being you, thank you for deep dark secrets and stupid retarded ones too. :) i'm glad you've found love, i'm glad you're happy and you will always be my makr of approval because your opinion makes a big difference in my life. who the heck else am i suppose to pinch and irritate right? love you.   miss you guys very, very much too.   we were putting up the christmas tree and it was this melancholic strange feeling...like i was happy and sad at the same time. i was happy because i had someone special to put our christmas tree together but sad at the same time because i missed you guys. and i thought about christmas shopping, and parties. i thought about christmas eve service and christmas morning....wow.   it's about to hit midnight soon and i felt the urgency to write this down. to let myself go cry awhile, to let myself just sit in darkness but illuminate light at the same time. we're going to bed soon, and tomorrow will be thanksgiving. i am loved, i am confused, i am happy, i am okay, i am me.  just me you know?

      it's funny how your defenses are stirpped and you sit so vulnerable puffing on another stick of cancer. searching, trying, not knowing what to say and feeling a myriad of thoughts impound you.   going crazy again...the midnight walks, the mania state giving in to the depression giving in to the just pure madness. you wonder what goes on in deep within the mind, you wonder how your thoughts are put together. you scream at the voices but there is nothing concerte...the voices you hear are your own. the battle between good and evil, the battle between right and worng...the battle of miind and heart.   there are times, deep in the still of the night, you curl into a little ball and beg for some entity to release you. that or beg for the solutions, the answers. sometimes though, sometimes i don't think i really want to know.   seventeen million misdiagnoses, just trying, trying then trying again. but somehow those words don't quite bring you comfort much like they used to.   you have panic attacks, and they seem so real...so delibitating. so there. you can't breathe, it hurts, you can't think straight to save your life...just want to run, run, run. escape.   there are times you know you need to go back in again, but you can't. you can't because you're trying to save the world again...protecting anyone and everyone. you try to focus, to concentrate, to find meaning in something else but what else is there. you feel like nothing and empty and the dirty crud you try to brush off so hard from your soles. (souls)  physically you're fucked, and mentally too. so in your mind it makes so much sense to just let go. just give up. but everyone around you screams and screams. screams so much you don't know what the answer is anymore. heck, do you even know the question?

      i performed for 2800 people over the weekend...yet out of three standing ovation curtain calls, not any one of them were of my family in the audience clapping, screaming, whooping. you know you search in a crowd for something familiar, something you know? you how you search for your dad so proud of his princess? or for the (good) tears streaming down your mom's face...you know how you look out for you brother, wanting to know what he thought, what he suggests, things you should do, things you shouldn't have done?  this is my second production here without them around..it's strange. it's sad. it's makes me want to curl up into a ball and stay there a while.   you know how there are people in your life you would do absolutely anything for? you know the people in your life that you want so much to make them proud? for me, most of the time, is me trying to do right. me trying to not screw up. for my parents....because a lot of times, at the end of the day, i think to myself that my parents don't deserve such shittiness.   and so there are days you take long long walks when you're in a manic state. impulsively wanting to fly and die at the same time. you sit outside eckerds and pizza hut too tired to move, too tired to cry anymore, too tired of life and you sit on the side of the road and count the cars that whizz by you. 100....200.....250..and finally he comes to rescue you, save you. screams at you, yells at you in the parking lot...WHAT IN THE FUCKING HELL ARE YOU THINKING?   i'm not.   you can't explain it. can't explain the demons that corrode your mind, can't describe the empty harsh mean voices that churn inside you. but yet you tell yourself you can't be admitted again, you can't go back in there. you either die, or you fucking bloody make it. no in between bullshit racheal, you yell at yourself.   you cannot do this to the ones around you again.   and the doctors struggle around your head medicine and your body medicine. they struggle with drugs, then they struggle with disorders. they know you are definitely depressed, and that you definitely have manic tendencies too....they know you starve starve starve yourself, or that you throw up till you bleed. they even count the scars on your body, or ask again and again how this new bruise appeared, or cut, or ciggaratte burn. and you just shrug and say, i don't know. i was hurting. i'm strupid. i'm fine. and they want to evaluate you for borderline personality disorder, and they want to do this and that and this and that and at some point you scream. you break down. you give up.   the other docors drag you in because you have blood in your urine, because you are in fucking pain all the time, because your body, like everything else, is giving up on you.   yet there are good days. and fuck yeah, i mean they are good.   there are days you come home to a meal prepared, a night planned, a back rub and a place to come home to. there are nights with the dog and playing catch. there are afternoons with the kids, or evening at the shows. there are times with him, that i feel safe. alright even.  there are times.  and these times make up life.   me.  and it's never easy, never easy at all.  so you just try  and try  and try  and try.

      it's that feeling that nobody listens but everyone hears....something in the way the world looks funky around you, almost out of place. as if you're suspended in some god-awful reality, a nightmare pounding in over, and over, and over again.   so i haven't written in a while, it's not much different is it?   the emails come at first, truckloads by the day, and you have good well intentions to get to it, but you can't seem to face this, to face the real world, to face being sick, to face who you are, what you are. or maybe you're just lazy.   but slowly you fade off, behind thesewalls. slowly you disappear. you go day by day, and play your roles, push the buttons, go up and down, smile, laugh, cry, love, understand, feel, want, need, nothing, everything.

      (failing little shit.)  it's coming on so strong now, i can feel it in my very pores. the submission of antagonizing fear and there is nothing, nothing i can do. the tears they flow like torrents quenching a desperate drought. crying as if i could do this for the next five hundred years, crying so desperately, painfully. i don't know what i am anymore.   as i stand, one hand pulls me back to fall back and sink slowly into the ground. i am not me anymore. if anything, i don't even know who i am?  why do i do this every other day? every other month? why do i sit here and question, question, question? why is it sometimes just so goddamn hard to love myself. tell me, why? why can't i love me?  why do i hate her?  why do i hate the girl in the mirror so much?  it's as if you go through these emotions...sometimes fear, sometimes calamity, sometimes pride....and sometimes nothing at all. i am so ashamed of her, it's as if the distorted image in my mind is magnified by a hundred billion times more. and i want to do is tear her apart, and scream. scream. scream.   i hate you. i hate you racheal sarah khong chui mei. i hate every single shitty existence of you.  want to know the truth?  i'm really not all the strong. really not all that i'm cut out to be.   i am Nothing.   and sometimes, it seems as if nothing doesn't even describe it.  i am angry with myself. angry because i'm not good enough, not smart enough, not pretty enough, not a good friend, not a good girlfriend, not a good daughter, not a good sister, not a good anything at all.   it's all just a big pretend.   i am angry because i am a sordid waste of space. i am angry because i keep on trying and trying and i swear i really do. i try so hard my heart breaks, my skin is calloused and i am so confused.   i am tired of this madness. i'm tired of swinging between extremes. i tired of jagged jaded pills that don't seem to do anything at all sometimes. i'm tired of hope, because sometimes hoping hurts the most.   when you tell yourself just a little bit more.  when you say it's okay. when you try try try try try try try.   you know what the saddest thing is?  it's that in between it all, some part of me still believes. and it is that very part that lets me down each and every time.   i want to run. i want to take a knife and slash myself into a hundred pieces. i want to take a hundred pills, smile, and maybe take a hundred more.   but then, i know as much as you do, that i will never succeed doing it.   never succeed in killing myself, if only just to prove my point that i am an utter failure at everything.   i don't know if it's worst to not have anyone understand or to have someone live inside this head too.   i'm tired tonight. broken i suppose.   i'm  just  so   tired.  you know?  the scary thing is that it's brought on by nothing.  that i am losing it.   that i am losing me.  who am i?  what am i?  where is the little girl that danced with the pixies and sang with the fairies?  where's the bold, rauccous, laughy, smily, girl?  where's the butt kicking, ass sprouting, sarcastic bitching hot stuff?  why does this fat ugly disgusting loser stare back at me?  why does this old old distorted sad girl look into my eyes?  why is this girl me?   i need to get out of my head a while.   merry christmas. happy new year. feliz navidad. happy deepavali. selamat hari raya.   for all the holidays i long to celebrate.   for all the memories i wish to live.  for all the me, i want to find.    a long time ago, i know i loved me. a long time ago, i know i was capable of love and being loved. i don't know what has happened now, i don't know what i am. and i apologize, i'm sorry because i'm a shitless piece of existence. i'm sorry because i am absobloodylutely nothing. i'm sorry because i don't know what else to be.   i'm sorry.   i should go lose myself a while.

      we left for waffle house down by davis at around 2:54 ...our waffle house. he said it made sense...a complete circle. it's where we always used to go when we were dating....the nights we'd spend talking and talking, deliberating to the wee hours of the morning. everything and nothing all at once. you know how you can talk and talk and talk with somebody for endless hours and still have more to say?  or how you can sit in silence with one another and walk away feeling like you've had the best conversation ever?  and all through the night he was everything you could ask for in a man. he carried my bags and rubbed my back. packed my shit and rocked me to sleep. wiped away my tears and smiled with me...laughed. i'd somehow promised myself i wouldn't cry at  the airport. only three weeks racheal, only three fucking weeks.  but maybe it was the gentle way he held my hand, and swept away my fringe planting a kiss on my forehead. maybe it was the tender way he whispered i miss you already as we left the house. or maybe it was the way he listened the night before as i told him about the ex and our conversation and how i was confused and angry and frustrated and hurt and he took it like a man. he took it like the man i fell in love with and just listened.   because sometimes, that's all you want anybody to do...  listen.   i am on my way home. and there's something indellibly magical about it. i will miss him, and i will miss waking up and falling asleep with a warm body enclosing mine. i will miss our silly conversations and yes, even our stupid fights. i will miss making up and making out with you, i will miss waiting till three in the morning for you ot come home so we can have dinner together. i will miss having you call me beautiful and i will miss calling you stinky. :P i will miss your sexy lovely ass and i will miss holding your hand.   i love you so much and yes, i'll bring back a ring.   maybe.   :P  love you.   it's 2:14 in morning in singapore and i am blessed.

      there's something about listening to christmas music and a cup of hot, steaming milo (yes, milo...that's shitty cocoa for him and fucking excellent homemade 3-1 milo for me), attempting to study and avoid the slobbering kissies of my dog at this hour.  that and also trying desperately to remember what i need to bring back, what needs to go home and what needs to stay here, the seven million things i have to pick up before monday night and precariously balancing the weights of right and wrong, good and bad, sad and happy.   they caught saddam. and it feels so goddamn weird.   i've been asleep for most of the day. i took my vistaril in the afternoon and pretty much knocked myself out for most of the day. i don't know what it was....maybe it was being alone in the house and trying to figure out the world, maybe it was the excitement and anticipation of going home, maybe it was the fear of seeing grandma alive for the last time, maybe it was knowing we wouldn't spend our first christmas together. maybe, maybe, maybe it was so many things.   and i wanted to cry. and laugh. and i wanted to sob myself sorry and laugh hysterically. so i knocked myself out. took an extra dosage.  for emergencies like this she prescribed.   and so i slept into and oblivion. the great thing about vistaril is that the nightmares go away.   and i'm at peace.   i leave at four in the morning on tuesday....this is so strange.      urlLink  "chrisraettig (01:25:15): "adhere to your own act, and congratulate yourself if you have done something strange and extravagant, and broken the monotony of decorous age" - or something like that.

      there are times i open up the door, and i am put into place by all the impounding darkness that reveberates out.   i had a sick scary dream last night....or perhaps morning rather. i've had my days and nights mixed up lately...insomnia seems to come back and bitten my ass. hard.   the thing about dreams is that they feel so real, right at that moment. and you lay awake from it, shivering. asking...wondering what it meant. how it came about? what the fuck is going on?   and you're scared. oh god, you're scared. terrified. fear runs through you in an electrifying jolt.   i dreamt i was in the hospital again. and the nurses were cutting off my skin. i'd been in a fire somehow, and i was struggling to understand what was going on. i didn't know how it'd happened...and i was screaming. asking. panicking like hell.   anxiety attacks. anxiety attacks. anxiety attacks.   but there was this lady, she was so nice. so gentle. and she kept on saying it was okay. i'd be okay.   and for some odd reason, fariz is in the room next to me. plagued by some unknown illness.   and ryan's angry with me. i don't understand and i keep on questioning but it's as if i am running into a wall.  i collect bits and pieces of what happened.   everybody tells me i've hurt ryan. badly. i've torn up his soul and served it to him on a silver platter.  but i don't understand.  i don't understand.   i tried to runaway.  and he chased after me.   as always.   somehow we ended up in the van, him trying to talk me out of my catatonic silences. and somehow, distracted, there was a massive car accident. and i was strapped in, stuck into a vehicle bursting with flame. but i don't understand, i still don't.  i wake up and i say don't ever leave me.  i wake up and he looks down at me like he's been doing it a while and is still smiling.  he says good morning beautiful.      i am so afraid of losing the best thing that has happened to my life.  what if he has another heart attack?  what if he gets into an accident?  what if by some god damn freak accident, somebody kidnaps him? sells him to thailand as a male gigolo?    and he tells me i worry too much. i always worry too much.   and he tells me he's the luckiest little bastard in the world.  and i hug him a little tighter and say, no, that's me.     he moves deep within me. higher, deeper, harder.   i  moan  scream with pure ecstacy.   he lines my every inch of skin with kisses.  i hold on to him tightly, tighter.  contracting my muscles, wanting him to be in me forever.  this feels so right.   i don't want to lose hime ever, i don't want to lose him.   am i weird or just stupid?

       urlLink      urlLink  "When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears I held your hand through all of these years But you still have All of me"    he told me once, a long time ago that love was encapsuled into a tiny solitary clear glass. fragile. impounded. specially displayed.   and tonight, as my little city falls asleep, i am alone in the darkness left to reflect on a once forgotten dream. reality. memory.  it is about three-quarters after four, reaching five in the morning, and he lays next to me drifting into another realm where pixies fly and angels dance. i am suddenly drawn back to the memory of Him because the radio plays this hauntingly eerie reminiscence of him. i search for this file, flipping on mtv for it to coincidentally come into rotation. though how coincidentally that is in the overplayed, over rotated mtv world i don't know.   it's been a long time hasn't it? almost as if it was years and years ago. but i remember now, this would have been our second year.   there are times when ryan and i talk about our past. letting the skeletons out of the closets, opening a can of worms to be devoured and so many times it hurts to relive his pain as i imagine how absolutely sucky it must be for him too. yet sometimes, the jealousy gets the better of me. i want to scream and shout and be angry at him. i want to be angry with him because sometimes i know She still affects him in the crawling under your skin way it does. but how can i be hypocritical when i know he understands that i understand too.   in my past, the last couple of years, reaching two decades now...i have learned, grown, matured, shivered, crouched, broken, healed, mended...loved and most certainly lost.   but i don't suppose my story is like any other. like everyone else i am the girl in the middle of the night that lets her thoughts out every once in a while. more frequently perhaps. i am the homeless man that begs you for some change. i am the little tiny insecure kid that is the trouble maker. i am the reflection of me that criticizes and the inside of me that comforts.   heart against mind.   some psycho-therapy thing the ex-head doctor played with me once. i spent about two hours yelling at an empty spot on the wall, a space opposite me. it was supposed to be my mind, the evil person, the one that mocks, laughs, torments, criticizes and most importantly, breaks me down. and i spoke as my heart. my heart that fought and fought and was still fighting but was so tired. my heart that felt so broken, so used, so ugly, so not enough yet so hopeful. my heart that was so forgiving, so patient, so understanding. my heart that broke smaller and smaller into pieces as the madness continued.   the empty null void where 'the body' was. the constant tugging, the extremities of highs and lows taking toll.   and i sat there crying, begging, shouting, screaming, asking, understanding, listening, painfully feeling as she helped me transition into trying to get it all. i mean for christ's sake, how the fuck do you understand insanity?  ryan's keeping a dry-erase board for all my classes, my doctor appointments, my head doctor appointments, my medicine intakes and notes. it's like his big post-it-note of all post-it-notes. it's so i stop missing my dosages and start getting better he says. it's so i get into routine, the normality of things. it's so he can take care of me and know damn well that he's doing everything he can damn well bloody do.   but yet i have fallbacks like the other night. worrying, worrying, worrying. another anxiety attack, uncertain about what's to come, how to feel. the world around me and where i'm going. not sure because who's going to cuddle me to sleep at night. yet i don't want to be so far away from my family. striving to succeed succeed succeed yet trying not to kill myself in the process. understanding that i have shots, and medications and drugs and therapy but god damn it, how much more and how long more?  and so we laid together on the couch, him wrapped around my fetal position and let me cry.  let go.   deep breaths.  and he made me smile again.   you made me smile again.   p/s i'm going to PEE IN MY JAMMIES!!! :) lol someone  urlLink voted  me  urlLink in !?!?!? woohooo! madness...you people crazy or just insane?  :)  thank you though.   *does happy chicken dance!*       urlLink  "and you pray God no nightmares please in Jesus name I pray amen and the minute you wanna sleep dawn breaks you grin and say hey lets go run out to the lake and wait fourty five minutes for a complete sunrise and you see that God putting on makeup and you grin and say hey thats too much eyeshadow there dear and the cabbage butterflies flit around weeping willows their leaves tickle your back makes you giggle the silence broken by a single plop there goes the weaseley fish out of the lake"

       urlLink     padding, gently, softly flow.   river rushing from a stream nearby at the crack of dawn in the openness of nothing and the emptiness of everything.  the bottom of my soul, singing in fluttered harmonics of in between and slushing breezes. a melancholic tune sung repeatedly over and over again into the nothingness of a clear open sky. humming, sunshine warms my fingertips, so cold....i shiver. embracing mother nature; talking as if she listens to me. take in the sweet fragrance of blossoming tulips and the dying everglades. the pixies and angels form a circle around my wasteless tired body and dance.   eva cassidy seduces me from the streams of notes and keys wafting from the stereo just beside the fireplace. i curl up and scratch my little puppy's furr, him riveting and moving. orgasming from me scratching his back, relaxing. buzzingly unclear from half a glass of wine left on our coffee table built from scratch. kingfisher blue and upholstered with plaid blues and tiny lined lime greens.   her scratchy smooth voice transcends me into the world of dreams and the half-awake slumber. the in between world of reality.  i taste bittersweet old familiar tears..a strange comfort.   still alive. breathing. knowing. loving.  this is how it feels to take in....and let go.     ...i've wanted to write for a long time now. but it seems as if i have stumbled into a road block. thoughts and writing not flowing quite like it used too...it's as if the words are either tumbling out nonsensically or i am stuck for hours in front of a screen puttering around. knowing i feel the urge to write but having continuous stumbling blocks of sentences that are raggeddy and make me want to scream.   change is happening somewhere deep within me.   ...and again, i am afraid. undecided. is this the right path? am i who i think i am? am i making any sense at all?  so many nights we lay in bed. my head on his chest drowning to his heartbeat. reflecting on our day in the big bad world outside there....behind the cocoons of our four walls and feather topped bed with six thousand seven hundred and sixty two pillows. and sometimes he sings to me, or rubs my back. sometimes we talk about our day and our thoughts, feelings. sometimes i tell him about home, the colors, the people, the madness. and sometimes he lets it all go and tells me about his father. the verbal abuse, the beatings, the feeling of self-worthlessness and i feel absolutely useless in that moment. i can't take it away, and if i could, i sure as hell damn bloody would.   sometimes i feel guilty because i had a great childhood. the pain he trusts me with is so different. and deep inside, i know he is fragile and we cling on to each other drawing strength from one another. and i am thankful for those moments, no matter how painful it is to listen. no matter how indifferent he pretends to be. thankful because he sheds the tough guy happy go lucky act. thankful because he lets me be a part of him.   he told me once he used to laugh a lot when he was younger. and i see that same happy giggly kid when we pillow fight, or wrestle, or when i pin him down with my legs and tickle the heavens out of him. there's that glint in his eye as we laugh together.   and god knows, i am different too.   i am crustily oven-baked warm.     p/s why the heck does my cocoa puffs taste like peanut butter?  P/P/S : go vote for  urlLink joe ! :)   i. because i say so.  ii. because it would be a great honor.  iii. because i'd like to believe that he'll smile down from above and say fuck yeah! :)  hugs   urlLink  "That time has come again.

 sighing to an end of a climax, coming down from an orgasm. spent, wasted...and hearing wafts of an old familiar song gently playing, soaking in the aroma of burning berry candles and flicking through images. there was something to be said of the motion, the sensitivity in that moment, as if something had taken me out sureally and i looked down from above.   once again, i am useless for words. except that it all came crashing down in a suspended fluffiness. as in it was bad and awful and horrible but absolutely amazing at the same time. i haven't talked about it, i cried once then shoved it to the back of my mind. my uncle had three massive heart attacks and passed away peacefully about a month ago. yet i know he still had so many things he wanted to fulfill in his life. it comes bursting out through his veins, his work, his eyes. and for a while i questioned, questioned anything and everything that i could question.   painfully obvious, death is a constant calamity that shakes my world.   he lasted enough for mervin to make that 36 hour ride home. and my dad told me about the grace of god, the beauties of life. about how the pilots made sure he got off the plane first, and customs cleared him instantly. he told me how my aunt was so strong, so strong. he said he cried a lot. that everyone cried a lot and how the church overflowed with people. people from afar and near, people he had touched and people he had blessed.   a couple of days later, my dad called to say i love you. and this was maybe about two weeks after c.s.u. where my thoughts and feelings and nothingness jumbled into a whole crazy spectrum. still fragile, still mending and breaking at the same time. not knowing, not sure.  ....and he said, i love you. and that's all that matters. that it was okay, come what may.   no lectures, no stop this shit, no get a grip racheal.  i live in a world where i constantly feel like i am nothing. where i feel like i am letting down everyone around me....but that night, listening to my dad and my mom in the background, i realized i could be nothing, empty, shitty, smelly and ugly and i'd still be okay. that my parents would truly love me come what may.   it's hard to explain...almost as if all the knives in my heart begin to let go.   i constantly don't ever think that i ever deserve love. it's stupid, i know.    ...i have no doubt at all that my uncle is in heaven, perhaps watching over the kids and telling them stories like he used to do with me.   there are times where i am angry with god, mostly because i don't understand. i'll be the first to admit that my faith has somewhat wavered....that i go through days where i seriously doubt there is some entity above that looks over us, and others, kneeled down by my bed praying like my parents taught me a long time ago. the faith of a child, believing so faithfully and strongly that god will provide, that god will comfort.   i remember crying one night in the hospital...in the midst of a panic attack where my fingers had all clenched up and my sanity was seriously going. i remember that through it, in all in my head, i begged and cried for god. and maybe perhaps he did answer. and maybe perhaps i am okay....because look at where i am now.   i had nurses sticking needles, calming me down, scared of everything at the same time. it's hard to describe madness, it's this deep dark empty hole of paranoia and depression and extreme nonsensical highs.  i used to ask myself where i would be, what i had to do, where i was going.   and if i was serious about it, i have had no purpose nor direction the last year. it's like skiing down the black mountain when you don't even know how to ski.   c r a s h i n g.  but i have a plan now. and i have post-it-notes.  little things to say one step at the time racheal.  and maybe someday, i will save the world. maybe some day i will truly, really, be absolutely okay.  but for the in between here and there, i go to school, and write my papers. i tell ryan i love him everyday, so much that we represent one of those sickly couples that go i love you, no i love you more, no i love you infinity...la di da. :)  i try to talk to my parents at least once a day, check in. and truth be told, i am a lot more honest with the people in my life now. no more lonely seduction of depression. somehow, i seem to have gotten to a point where i am not so afraid of myself anymore. i don't know.   i'm crazy.   :P  i don't know how i got to this. i had ryan cuddling me and the song had ended. his palm on my sobbing chest...and i felt the pressing need to write it down. writing calms me down in this strange way, i don't know.  and yes, i am going home for christmas.   :)    urlLink  "It is a beautiful day and I would have it no other way.

      streaked crimson red hair, bleached with 40% white, a plastic cup and fork plus a whole lot of confidence(him) and bitchiness(me).  blonde to red in a night. silly stupid ditz to punk rock goddess. and the strange stttrraaannggee thing is that i feel like one too. a goddess. there's this store in seattle called the goddess in you, expensive as hell but amazing. there's this whole thing about inner beauty that people rant and rave about but sometimes, you just have to look it to feel it you know?  i don't know.  i'm really just rambling.   it's about three hours past my bedtime but i am still fucking awake.   and let me tell you, it sucks ass.   especially since brilliant me went to ALL my classes today thank you very much.   playing cutesy with the old man is always nice too. what more with mothernature's boobies and old man's pimping. ah...the wonders of simplicity is very ironic indeed.  i meant to write this down the other day. you see, where the old man grinch lives...down below holds a child-care full of innocence and wonder and so every couple of days i find myself itching and begging to go there. get lost in the world of superheroes and barbie dolls a while, get lost in the world of the tickle monster and the my turn! my turn!  it's the little things that i enjoy the most. that undescribable, unexplainable feeling of having an absolutely untouchable kid reach up for you. it's the smiles you giggle with, the twirl of a strand of hair, the fascination in big grown up you in their eyes and the fascination of adorable sweet devils in yours.   it's the give a little, take a lot.   yes, i am selfish.  taylor says dance with me, dance with me! courtney says me too! me too! and justin runs and runs and runs around you, screaming, giggling, laughing. so happy, so free. alex coos, and you're lost in this magical world..where you make faces and act silly for a couple of hours. you smile, they smile, you wipe off boo-boos and smell up icky poos. you color and pick up and dust off and laugh. as samuel asks for his bwocolli, and says don't leave yet, don't leave.   (watching too much dr suess makes you start rhyming after a while)  perhaps the best part of it all is the end of the day. when they tug and pull and say not yet! not yet! or the way you pick them up after their nap, and they reach out for you. instinctively, you want to protect them from the big bad world outside but try as you may, you know it'll never be. and so you teach them little things, and so do they, hoping that they are equipped, praying that they will know.   sugar-rush from divinity.  precious moments, special hours.   beautiful friends, caring notes.   sticking a ciggarette, inhaling, smiling, and saying;   life is good.   :)     urlLink  "Sometimes, you have to push a point. You can put up with an unacceptable situation for just so long then, suddenly, an additional factor becomes the last straw that breaks the camel's back. At first, you find yourself being surprised by the strength of your reaction: why have I rejected what I previously felt able to accept? You may begin to doubt your judgement. Are you illogical and inconsistent? No, you have merely reached a turning point. And you should be proud of that."     p/s yes, i know, what's up with all this happy, happy shit dude?  grr.  :P

      i read a suicide post today. i don't know that strikes me as relevant as it strikes me hard. there are things that are sometimes so damn uncertain in life. the question of death versus life. will you take that journey on your own or do you leave it up to the fates above?  there are times you feel so invisible, sometimes helpless. and it's painful to realize emotionally all that you are, can be, will be.   i am no one.   --  i have to lose about a good 15-20 pounds for chicago this spring. there's something about doing the 'cell block tango' number that makes me want to pee in my pants.   i am on the atkin's and frankly, i am grumpy as hell. all that meat can certainly not do you too much good.   when you have an eating disorder, it is a constant battle to stay on top. and when you're recovering, the battle is ten times harder.   it would be so easy to just not eat.   --  oldman, this has to be one of the most beautiful things i've read in a long time.    " Perifery   I have been reminded of late just how much we move through life so alone... How, despite all those desperate attempts at love and friendship...  At the end of the day...  We do it all by ourselves.  Existentialism is an interesting philosophical discussion, until you get your heart broken. Then you realize that, for all the trappings of social intercourse, it is true -  No one can take a bath for you.  Of course, having your heart broken has a way of making you kinder to strangers and small children, So, I suppose, even that has it's place in life.  Some things, though, I wish I could learn some other way.  Some things, I wish I could TEACH some other way.  I suppose, in the final analysis, we all learn...and we all teach.  The course is titled: Living Your Life 101.  I guess the thing to remember, as you continue the journey...  Is that, while you do make the trip... Trapped inside this "mortal coil" - itself working on dying from the day it's born...  ...While you make this trip all by yourself...  You are never really completely alone."    i needed to talk to you today. crying half-assed and having another nervous breakdown of some sort.   i've been questioning myself again lately. i seemed to have lost my footing in the world.   i don't know who i am.   am i making the right choices?  i've been figuring out all sorts of things about me, maturing you say, but yet it still seems so difficult. there's still so much more i want to know, want to hide.  am i any good at what i do at all?   is this my life choice?  will i be a two bit actress that waits tables 97% of the time and have that one passing crowd scene in an epic movie?  will i ever be able to confront my fears, be blatantly honest, have the patience to sit down and write my book?  and when i do will i be able to handle the criticism, will i be able to say i am wrong and you are right?  will anyone even read it?  there are times i  want  need someone to tell me i am fine. that i'm doing okay. that i am who i am and that i am one hundred percent alright.   and i thank you oldman for all those one hundred billion times that you do so.   i truly believe that you've helped shaped me into this slightly more confident person that i am through some nonsensical ass-grabbing and all that good shit.   your pictures say a million words.   and i thank you for showing me me through your eyes.   just as i am.  the barker and i are having small bitty problems that i know takes trust and time to solve.   you see, the problem is i hide. i run. i fucking hit the next train.   and he's all about talking, and working through shit. he's all about understanding.   in some crazy shitty mind of mine it pisses the shit out of me.   there are times i want to hit him and ask him why why why?  why do you choose me?  why am i the one you love?  why do you even want me?  and it's been so long but goddamnit it still hurts.   i gave my everything once, and i was me. i was me in every respect that i was a shitty person.   and frankly, it scares the hell out of me.   it scares me to remember.   yet i cannot help but do.   ---  i am hurting. and i don't know why i do.   i should be so happy.   i am so happy.  but it is sometimes so painful to be happy too.   ---  loonz, you are a beautiful person.   thank you for letting me be your friend.   call me sometime.  ---  i love you.   and sometimes that is all that there is to it.   i love how you remind me of that...that it's quite simple.   and i yell at you because i am angry with me, and i am angry at my world.  i blame you because i know you want the best for me yet i am so confized on my bullshit that it's hard to accept reality sometimes.   i have absolutely no right to scream at you when i fuck up my budget or when i decide today is too shitty of a day to get out of bed.   i have to remind myself that all because you are a part of me, that you still aren't me.  that you can't be responsible for my every flaw, my every shitting irresponsible action.  i love you, and i love you so so much it's hard.   i may be so american but i am still every bit malaysian.   and it's hard to be away from family, it's hard to be away from friends that know you inside out.   i am learning, and everyday i thank you because you support me in reaching for my goals, setting examples, finding me.   turning twenty, being adults, growing together.   they say the first year is always the hardest, well, we're one fucking year and it's still pretty damn good.   and i'm not just talking about the sex.   --  the drugs aren't really working.   i've been sick the last couple of days again.   i hate doctors. and i hate chemicals. and i hate this whole notion of being dependent on pills for the rest. of. my. fucking. life.   --  zigi is the most adorable puppy ever.       "did god make you, them, without a heart, without a soul?"

"if you can't find anything at wal*mart, it's not worth buying,"   once in a while though, the boyfriend and the old man gang up together to attack. like waking up at nine in the morning for school. or taking my medicine. or stupid responsible shit like that that they just seem to like to bug me about. :P  we've also seemed to have exchanged rooms with bethany. it's a fresh start i must say, out with the old, in with the new. meshing our tastes together. calculated decisions instead of when we first moved in and just combined all of our furniture together, regardless.   bright blue and green curtains, rainbow striped bedsheets, our hullabooloo kick-ass entertainment set, little bits of me and him pronounced.   i've also somehow slipped into the role of homemaker. it's a good role though, a little odd but nice nonetheless.   i make dinner, he cleans, we do lovey-dovey shit together. it's cute. :)  i like this, i am afraid i could fall in love with this life....i think i have already.   i am so fucking in love it might be blinding me. it's good to be blind though.  we are learning to grow together.  ----  my big fat ass and waistline has also taken a turn.   i am a chubby little shit at the moment. the medicine gives me the munchies and my boyfriend feeds me like i am from afganistan and am starving.  i have some damn good looking boobs at the moment though, fuck yeah fatness.   :P  there is a tiny little voice in me that still bugs me from time to time, so i alternate between the atkins and cheesecake diet. i think i might kill myself this way, but ah well, i'm crazy anyway.   ...doh.   --   "nobody told me that you only needed time to fly,"   i think i'm doing good for the most part. i'm a little off from time to time but it's okay.   there are nights where i still wake up and cry for grandma and there are still the night demons that keep me up with insane requests and mind pounding stupidity. yet i know, for the most part, is realizing that this will past. that things will get better and things work out with time.   it's this intricate giving and taking that tires me. i am so absolutely sick of being sick but this is me.   that girl in the mirror, me.   that smily ass bitch, me.   that stupid retard, still me.   i cannot run away from who i am, nor can i ever expect to just be anything less.   the power of 'be' amazes me from time to time.   i'm doing okay...how about you?

      i leave tomorrow.  it feels as if this trip has been too short and too long at the same time.   i remember only leaving yesterday, and suddenly, i am leaving again.   i've been back for about two and a half weeks now, though only half of it spent in malaysia.  i had a great christmas for the most part. something tells me i will always remember this one.   i played with heng yuen and taught him how to high five....i remember a while ago when i used to be so afraid of him yet now i am fascinated. fascinated by the way his mind works, fascinated by his own little world in which his glass murky doors are encaved.   i remember family and it's value. the emptiness, as if something was hugely missing from the table, from the festive season, from the occassion. wanting to say something, but not knowing what was safe. i missed you ku-chang, i know deep in my heart, that you're shining down on us. you were a big part of christmas to me, a big representation of singapore and my ku-chang. i still miss you, we all do.   i remember grandma and her voracity (sp?) yet there was something so fragile and vulnerable about it. she was so happy, literally like a little kid on christmas morn. she ate and ate and ate, and smiled and never once complained. she asked to see the christmas lights and so we drove her down to orchard road. and we talked, or rather i mostly just held her hand and hugged her and kissed her. she's so old now, i see the wrinkles on her hands and face, i touch her translucent skin that just coats her thin frail legs. she's almost bed-ridden now, they tell me, she doesn't smile much anymore. but this christmas though, this christmas, she was happy. happy because everyone was there, big and small, far and away, australia, taiwan, america, shanghai, kuala lumpur, london. we all rushed back to see her. maybe even for just one last time.   she had a heart attack the night we left. we came back the next day and two by two, we masked and watched her through glass windows. wanting to say fight on grandma, fight on....yet the other part needing to let her go for she was tired. wanting to see some sign of hope, some sign of life. wanting to see her take her own breath, kick a little, perhaps open her eyes. the little girl in me says don't go just yet grandma, i'm scared. and the other part says, it's okay now, we're okay. it's all going to be okay. tell grandpa and kuchang and the kids i said hie okay?    reunited.   i mustn't be so selfish.   back in malaysia and picking up things and putting them away. rushing to meet seven million people before i leave, holding on so tightly and itching to be home with my baby at the same time. so much left to do, the unexpected interruption, i was only supposed to be in singapore for four days. and we shelved ourr plans for new year's, and we took long long exhausting trips. yet i know, i'd do it all again. i'd do it all again because she made me cakes and goodies, and fed me and clothe me, and loved me and all sorts of wonderful beautiful things that she is.   i should go pack my bags some more, cram in perhaps more gifts and brahim's mixes.   i am excited but weary.   my parents are amazing people you know? it's funny how it takes your almost nineteen years to figure out how much you love them and how much they love you. it's in the little things...it always is isn't it?   my brother had his first day of work yesterday. and i know this bond of sibling hood that no one can break. the one where my mom tells me about how i have no one else but him if they're not around. and that's why the both of us are around. he's the more protective, cautious one and as always i am the crazy, slightly delusional brazen one. the one that touches the hot stove while he rushes to puts ice on my burnt fingers despite him repeatedly cautioning me against so.   it's 6:56 malaysian time. and the house is beginning to stir awake. my parents have special plans and we're all going to do family stuff today. they've taken the time off and itr's strange to feel so special. from the way nicholas says i wait for you to take a shower-lah to you call me whenever you get a chance and we go wherever whatever-lah. to archana's standing open invitation. bryan flies in tonight, and maybe we'll meet up at two in the morning for laughter and stupidness. sakthi and her goddamn vinna classes but coming anyway, that damn girl and the indian blood in her that drinks like a fish. the few couple of us, good friends. always. forever. inside.   fariz, whom i'll always love and treasure. good times, great memories.   blogger friends...meeting winnie for the first time and their crisis of needing to get new clothes? meesh, grace, ash, jikon, dinesh, najah, shahrizal, tv, and i know i'll never name them all. there's just so darn many of them, and just so many darn things to love about them.   jae, my hungarian goddess whom i haven't seen and probably won't get to.   so amny things you know, so many pieces to tie together.   can't wait to go home and cuddle with my lover, can't wait to play with the dog and hand out christmas gifts! can't wait to unpack and tell all my crazy stories, can't wait to talk to three in the morning, can't wait to eat his homemade mac and cheese. can't wait. can't wait.   yet i don't want to leave.   i do. i don't. always broken, always torn apart.   that's just life isn't it?

       Sunday | 15 Feb 2004  No one. Nothing. Nevermind. Part 4. I'm disappointed by something that is superficially so trivial, but that inadvertently, though not innocently, became inbued with meaning and significance to me.  I am pining for something that was never there. That was never real. That seemed promising but was never manifested.  I yearn. I yearn.  There is a hole, a gap waiting to be filled but that now looks like it never will.  It hurts.  I don't know why, and it seems so stupid. But it hurts.  I wake up in the morning and it hurts. I get some quiet time and it hurts. My heart aches for a loving hand that was imagined. And it hurts.  It's been two days and it still hurts. Even though it was never real to begin with. Because it was never real to begin with.  As the hours tick by, it will never begin to be real.  It hurts. I hurt.  Posted by jikon at 09:43 PM    we've been fighting so much lately...and it hurts. it hurts not because of just the things we say to each other in the heat of the moment, but the implications of it. the little voice in me that says it's over. run. don't get hurt. take some time. run godfucking racheal run.   he snaps at me and i don't say a word, i say nothing at all. and it infuriates him to a degree that's unexplainable till he bursts with more anger, more daggers into my heart. and i can't eplain it to him, the need to close up, draw in, stare off into space...he doesn't get it. doesn't want to get it, hates it when i close up so tight and shut him and the rest of the world out.   he yells at me sometimes, screams and it's so loud my ears hurt. i hurt. and sometimes i scream back, but i only get a sentence in before i crumble into pieces because i am crying so hard. then he's angry he's hurt me, and i'm angry i've hurt him, and we're both so angry and so hurt. he makes a joke, and i still want to be angry and hurt and fucked and yell but i smile. and i stifen a grin because it's silly anyway.  and we are back to normal lovey dovey shit again.   taking it from one extreme to another, sharing our lives, us, together.   my mother tells me that no relationship doesn't ever not go through the wringer. that there are ups and downs, goods and bads. and i understand.  i understand beyond understand.  but there are times where it's so hard to just hold on and not give up.   but then there are times where this relationship is as magical, as romantic, as insane as the little girl dreams you had.   there are so many questions, and so much pressure, and so goddamn many things that i need to do, have to do, cannot do.   i am lonely, and loneliness is so painful.  i miss him, sometimes even when he's next to me, and i love him.   i love him and so everyday i tell myself, it's okay.  i'm okay.  and i know this when he does the little things and appreciates my little things.   love isn't all peaches and roses....love is accepting, learning, trying, giving, forgiving.  hold on tight and never let go racheal, hold on so fucking tight because much as you run, this is the best thing that has happened to you ever.

      Friday | 20 Feb 2004  Relationships I: Men! When I was a child, I thought that one day a man would come and sweep me off my feet. He would be tall, not necessarily dark but certainly handsome. He would be wise and witty. He would be charming and eloquent. But most of all, he would be strong, protective, loving and caring. He would be a real man. Not a boy. Not a child who wouldn't grow up. Not a man who requires constant attention. Not a ditzy queen. But a real, big, buffed man.  As I grew up, I began to realise what a fallacious fantasy this was. This man did not exist. Or if he did, he was so deeply hidden in the haystack that I'd sooner find the needle before I found him. Instead, life yielded men who were in the closet and troubled; men who were married and were trouble; men who were in trouble and couldn't fend for themselves let alone me. And then, there were men who were just plain trouble.  Then sometimes, you meet a man who asks for honesty and truth. A man who would offer a sincere relationship and expect the same. You talk, you get intimate, you discover and cultivate the chemistry, only to find out just as you're about to cross the rubicon that he is no better than the rest: a coward, an idiot, a basket case and a master of dissimulation. You've been nice, kind and honest. But being nice and kind doesn't get you into bed with anyone. In the gay world, being gym-fit and a bitch does.  The problem with men really is that they are men. You can't live with them and you can't live without them. They are insensitive, inconsiderate and in a world of their own. If they can help it, they'll fuck your brains before they fuck you. There are days, and perhaps even weeks, when men being themselves are enough to drive a gay man straight.  And then you actually meet a nice guy. At least, so he appears on the first meet. He's got a nice deep voice and a kind heart. He makes you laugh and remembers to send you SMSes when you're down. But then, deep inside, you know that such good men don't exist. A good man is an oxymoron. And this good man is straight and ostensibly unavailable.  So the cycle begins anew. You don't learn from past mistakes because to do so would be depressing. To do so would suggest that there's no hope in men and that we all ought to give up while we're ahead. And that would not be good. That would take life out of the living.

      slipped between the cracks of esquisite looking spanish american familes, somewhere in between i promised myself i'd find it. some niche of everything that brings meaning to life.  we fought a lot through orlando and back, i don't know what it was about, snapping at each other, fighting about nothing then another then something else. something off between the both of us, cuddling, fighting, making love, screaming. exhausting.  exhausting to a degree of numbness.  crying so much, so goddamn much. so tired of the doctors and so much goddamn fucking pressure.  i'm tired world, i'm tired of you and this and everything.  we watched a diesel blow up in flames, as rob called 911 and everyone sits open mouthed gaping at the fire across the interstate. god bless somebody a little voice whispers, no survivors, burnt crisp and into nothing. for about 30 minutes we sat and watched in silence. imagine what death must be like burning alive.  then there was disney and epcot and walking walking walking. turkey drumsticks and china, mexico, america. there was aurora and little girls all in awe and the magic of disney you wish to capture and tuck away into someplace safe. there's the tiny balance of not getting shit faced in the hotel but nicely buzzed. the smell of alcohol on his breath as we're tlaking in the middle of the night about life and malaysia and figuring out details. goddamn details.  there is so much going on and no holding on point. there is so much wrong and changing and healig and hurting. \there is just so much fucking going on.

      Ki System   Natal Year number:  7  Although Racheal may have taken a considerable time to reach maturity, she is nevertheless a quick thinker whose ideas change as rapidly as her conversation.  She's an individual who wants to be liked, and as such finds it hard to refuse requests.  For the same reason she dislikes arguments, and wherever possible will compromise to avoid conflict.  Not the sort of individual to be employed in litigation, but excellent in mediation.   Natal Month number:  9  Although Racheal may be relied upon to start her allotted tasks, she cannot always be relied upon to complete them.  This is not because Racheal is lazy, but because her active brain has alighted upon something else that she wishes to pursue.  Nevertheless she has leadership potential and the ability to inspire others with her charm and humour.   Natal House number:  3  With a high energy level, and ambitions to match, Racheal will show early promise.  Unless her tendency to expel this energy on too many projects can be overcome, a promising beginning may soon evaporate, giving way to anger and frustration.  Racheal is someone who enjoys a good time with an active social life, and needs the direction of more sober minds.   Comments based on Western Grid      11        Racheal is a balanced individual who can understand and appreciate the views of others as well as her own.  She can express herself fluently, and with persuasive conviction, whilst taking account of opposing views.  This means that Racheal will get on very well with colleagues at work, both senior and junior, as well as clients, customers, suppliers and external agencies.       4        A practical individual, Racheal is a neat and tidy craftsman who can organise others to achieve her plans.  She should use those practical skills and organisational ability in an office management, or secretarial function, or by applying such skills to self-employment.  In general, Racheal is a neat and tidy individual - qualities of value to many different jobs.       88        A perceptive individual, Racheal takes little on trust.  She maintains fixed views which once established are difficult to change.  Conscientious by nature, she will make a good businessman or accountant, but being naturally perceptive, and unwilling to accept views of others without solid evidence, she may well turn to philosophy.       9        Ambitious to improve her lot, Racheal will constantly push forward to achieve something in her life, yet this ambition will be balanced by humanitarian ideals that will lead her to support causes that may demand self-sacrifice.   [The Arrow of Scepticism: lacking the numbers 3, 5 and 7]   Taking little on trust, in adult life Racheal requires solid proof before she accepts a concept.  Characterised by honesty and fairness, she is quite intuitive, yet firmly sceptical of the claims made, for example, by religion.  This may be important at work, if employers require employee acceptance of work practices that are not immediately verifiable.   Comments based on Chinese Grid      11        Racheal will be reasonably successful in financial terms, and enjoy a degree of luck.       44        Rather stubborn, Racheal is inclined to believe that she is always right.  But she enjoys high intelligence, and often thinks that she is superior to others.       8        In the absence (in the Chinese version) of the numbers 1 and 6, she will be good with money and details.  She will be happier if the Chinese grid includes the numbers 5 and 7.       99        Racheal is intelligent, and prepared to learn.  Without the numbers 3, 5 and 7 in the Chinese version, Racheal is likely to use her head at the expense of her heart, which can lead her to become something of a workaholic.   [The Arrow of Apathy: Lacking the numbers 2, 6 and 7]   Racheal lacks the will to succeed.  Somewhat indecisive, she will miss opportunities and avoid risk.  Racheal needs to recognise that life's chances must be grasped with both hands when the opportunity arises.   [The Arrow of Loneliness: Lacking the numbers 3, 5 and 7]   Racheal is so determined to achieve her objectives that she does so at the expense of all else, including friends, family, love and laughter.   ---  Ki System   Natal Year number:  8  Ryan is a steady, responsible and reliable individual who dislikes change for change's sake.  He is a solid family person who enjoys tradition, but is inclined to say exactly what he thinks.  Such frankness can occasionally land him in trouble.  Behind a somewhat ponderous exterior lies a deeply sensitive soul whose core is rarely exposed to public view.   Natal Month number:  2  Compassionate and supportive of others, Ryan is something of a perfectionist who will find it hard to delegate even routine tasks.  Ryan is hard-working and good with details, but to get the best out of him, Ryan needs to know that in the end his efforts will be properly rewarded and acknowledged.   Natal House number:  2  Believing in his own abilities, Ryan's attention to detail will lead him to success through hard work and his own unaided efforts.  He can however work well as a member of a team even though he will rarely, if ever, delegate responsibility without stringent conditions.   Comments based on Western Grid      1        Although Ryan may be reasonably talkative in public, he finds it difficult to express personal feelings to those closest to him.  In employment terms, this inhibition is of little consequence.       333        Despite an excellent brain, Ryan is governed by his powerful imagination.  Inclined to be petty, Ryan is best employed as a writer or actor/actress.  The problem that Ryan faces, is his belief that imagined facts are true, when in reality these so-called 'facts' are nothing more than a figment of his imagination.  But for works of fiction, those imaginative powers are invaluable.       8        Good with details and with a methodical approach, Ryan nevertheless is someone who enjoys constant new challenges to maintain his interest.  He is a methodical individual with attention to detail, but is inclined to leave tasks unfinished if his active mind alights on something of greater interest.  Routine tasks that fail to challenge his intellect are at greatest risk, so Ryan needs a job that offers variety.       9        Ambitious to improve his lot, Ryan will constantly push forward to achieve something in his life, yet this ambition will be balanced by humanitarian ideals that will lead him to support causes that may demand self-sacrifice.   [The Arrow of Frustrations: lacking the numbers 4, 5 and 6]   Ryan finds it difficult to accept other people as they really are, and is constantly disillusioned with life.  Once he accepts that others are only human, the frustrations will cease.   Comments based on Chinese Grid      111        Ryan enjoys a positive and balanced approach to life and will be financially successful.  If the Chinese version also contains 2 sevens, Ryan is very fortunate.       3        Unless Ryan also has in the Chinese version either the numbers 5 and 7, or the numbers 4 and 8, he will be hypersensitive and prone to stress-related problems.       8        In the absence (in the Chinese version) of the numbers 1 and 6, he will be good with money and details.  He will be happier if the Chinese grid includes the numbers 5 and 7.       99        Ryan is intelligent, and prepared to learn.  Without the numbers 3, 5 and 7 in the Chinese version, Ryan is likely to use his head at the expense of his heart, which can lead him to become something of a workaholic.   [The Arrow of Suspicion: Lacking the numbers 4, 5 and 6]   Ryan is a cynic who worries too much about the downside.  He needs to recognise more of life's advantages.   [The Arrow of Apathy: Lacking the numbers 2, 6 and 7]   Ryan lacks the will to succeed.  Somewhat indecisive, he will miss opportunities and avoid risk.  Ryan needs to recognise that life's chances must be grasped with both hands when the opportunity arises.       urlLink http://www.idealpartner.org.uk/ipbi/WhatJob.asp

      it's always good when your doctor prescribes you incredible amounts of medicine that you are deathly allergic to.   i really should sue.   or at least think about it.  it's days like these i thank someone up above for having my boyfriend read the labels before he feeds them to me.   and then i curse them the fuck out.  --  i'm in a strange happy mood, nevermind that i was hysterically freaking out last night but that's a different matter completely. something in the lines that i almost fucking died.   i'm allergic to ibuprofen.   so take notes everybody, mix a little bit of the blue pill and i'm as good as six feet under.   i know this because one fine night when the tylenol ran out i stole some ibuprofen from bethany and a couple of minutes later i stopped breathing and my eyes swelled up to disgusting proportions. on the other hand though, i know what i'll look like if i ever was a fat ass bug.  so case in point, in nice bold red sticky paper on top of my chart has a list of medications that i am allergic to.   la di da, going down her list, she prescribed me prescription strength motrin.   so we go and get my precriptions filled and then fucking realize that motrin is bloody ibuprofen.   at 10:30 at night when i am writhing in pain.   exactly.  doctors are so fucking stupid.   apparently one of my ovaries are enlarged, and of course, they don't have a fucking clue why.   so in a knapsack,  i almost died yesterday.   (nevermind that our hospital is right down the street)  i have another fucking bloody thing growing in me.   and my boyfriend is one hell of a patient supportive bastard.  --  ultrasounds next monday, we're leaving for disney tommorow, we found our dog shacked up in a bloody animal resort spa thing, my mom comes in two weeks and i am a fucking retard.   --  i did have one thought though, imagine what it would do if i took it all?    wa ha ha ha ha ha.

       Today is one of those days that is hard to function. It’s as if my body and mind is split in two and my mind is just somewhere in between….or perhaps no where. There are many days that nothing makes sense and I am constantly fluctuating from manically insane to downright suicidally depressed. There are no answers, there is no cure…only understanding…only trying, then trying again. I am in school, sometimes it is good, and sometimes it is bad. Part of finishing my degree is to take a general psychology course in which I have mixed feelings about. It’s hard to explain a mental disorder, it’s even worst trying to make sense of it. There are times that I am embarrassed because the lonely seduction of depression can be a painful thing. To sit in class and sometimes be angry because the others are ignorant, or to feel alienated because you understand just exactly what your teacher is talking about…perhaps a little bit too much. Yet there are other days where I feel like a sponge, wanting to soak up possibly everything and anything that I can learn about the psychology of things. Cupid versus psyche, seratonin versus sanity, brain versus matter.   I remember a class in which we played Deepak Chopra and the immensely special bond of your mind and body. The unexplainable lengths in which your body might actually be healed by your mind…positive thoughts, positive thoughts, positive thoughts. I asked a question, one which I hold truly to my heart; is it possible to get off my medication and just let some inner resilient strength in me cure me? He answered no.   We are perhaps only half way through class, and I still have many questions unanswered. Will there ever be a way to solve these questions without returning back to pill popping? Can we just talk it out? Brain transplant? Anything at all? You see, manic depression isn’t just like a cold; it doesn’t go away in a couple of days and if anything it is a stupid disease. Stupid as in it makes you want to do and do stupid things. There are times where you feel no amount of medicine will ever help, and times where your medicine takes a weird turn and pushes you towards the ledge. I do not want to get off this ledge.  There was a paper that I wrote at the beginning of class that forced me to explore the areas of clinical psychology. With a little bit of force and help from the class, I have discovered that I am a good person and that this isn’t a disability. I don’t think I would ever pursue being a psychologist but the thought was nice, to be able to live that dream a while. To truly believe in myself and the world around me that this little crazy 19-year old Malaysian girl could do something about it.  I am an international student and I come from a country where mental illness is a hush-hush. Your visits to the psychiatrist is a James Bond mission, one that takes a lot of planning and secrecy. In America, you ask, now why in the world for? The same reasons we never ever say anything offensive to our government in public, the same reason we are more open but ignorant in a lot of ways. I have enjoyed this freedom, I have enjoyed quenching my thirst of knowledge, I have been comforted that being manic-depressive isn’t such a big bad thing at all.   Learning is a wonderful thing, minus the parts of course where you can’t concentrate or that your butt wouldn’t get out of bed. This general psychology class that I much dreaded has become interesting to me. I love that I do not have a teacher that gives monotonous lectures and instead employs other techniques. How would you have ever guessed that you could learn about your brain through chocolate-chip cookies? Our teacher gives examples and listens, yes, even to my roommate’s silly boyfriend that comes out with the most absurd theories. It makes my jaded perception of the world a little less cynical.  There are a lot of smart people in my class, and what they say about people inspiring each other is true in this. I don't talk much about me in class, mostly, I sit behind and just sorta hide. It inspires me though to listen to other people’s life and apply their techniques or draw strength in their courage in some weird way. I am not alone, and that is a very good thing.   I have learned a lot in this class. Things that I will probably carry with me to my grave, some about people, some about me, some about nothing and everything.   Perhaps that is the stepping stone that college gives you, a time in your life to explore and educate yourself. Take what you have and fly.  I suppose general psychology wasn't too bad.    yes, yes, another crappy selfish lets talk about me paper.

      he had a dream about you the other day, you'd laugh at this when i tell you. i don't know if it's weirder that my boyfriend is dreaming about my ex-girlfriend or that we both had dreams about you in the same night.  i've been leafing through blogs again, catching up, reading bits and pieces of different people from around the world...and it's funny how certaon inflections and simple words can have such a big pow wow on your day.  i missed you.  oh wait, i said that already didn't i?  i feel as if i am at a turning point and stuck in the same exact position at the same time. my sexuality, the person i am, my connection to the big wide world.  who exac tly is this girl living in pensacola?  lets sit down and have some coffee a while, biscuits, cookies, whatever the hell you call it nowadays.  happy valentines day...was it good?

      it's dark in here..there's really nothing much to do except work on my research somemore or maybe attempt to make something to eat. i haven't been too well lately, the pain is back and magnified by about a billion times. if i had nuts, school work have squeezed them fucking dry. my finals for my math class is fast approaching and i cannot help but worry worry worry myself to death. there's something about being a perfectionist that's soothing. it's like cutting yourself, one of those so wrong but so right things i suppose.   i can't seem to get out of this habit of picking at the little things. really.   my next appointment is on monday. i.....don't know. let's not talk about it.   my puppy's missing and we've tacked up signs all along ninth avenue and back, sasquatch doesn't seem to give a damn and ziggi just enjoys the extra fucking attention. damn we live in a selfish world.   i really should switch on the lights in here, being in the dark just makes me want to tear something or yell. i can't decide yet.  there's evil spicy fish curry sitting in the fridge that i need to go clean up.   we also did about seventy two loads of laundry last night in honor of our new steel contraption wardrobe and so we have seventy two loads of ironing to do.   fuck.  me.  .....  i am such a terrible terrible housewife.

      big beautiful opacent twinkly dreams that come shining through a foggy night. winter turns around and the cold that bites through your skin vanishes with the comfort of love. bleeding, bright crimson fluid that flows from your pores...make it go away.  hurting, crying, sobbing..make it go away, baby, make it go away.  he holds you tight, tighter. humming. humming makes the evil pain go away.   this world is fucked, you rock and fetalize. fuck you, fuck all of you.      "There's nothing you can do to make anybody feel better and it's going to hurt for a long, long time,"

      courage mustered somehow to make that call. an empty stare, the bits of silence that are uncomfortable. a sudden shift into a memory of another phone call, pain. hurt that sears through you and you wonder. relive those moments, and you wonder why he brings it up. oh no wait, it was me. stupid me.  i didn't know. i wanted you to..to come, to say it was okay, to say you still cared, to love me, to need me as much as i did in that very moment. to say you would. to say that i was worth every bit that hassle of a three hour drive. perhaps you would never know, perhaps you would never understand what it took, or how much i gave to you. perhaps you will never know how much you meant to me..once, a long time ago. yesterday. perhaps you will never know just how much you still can hurt me. fight back and swallow the tears, it's only a stupid scrabble game and only a stupid conversation. all those dumb techniques about breathing in and breathing out just seem like soapy flacky duds of bullshit in this moment. why? hide, and cower with hands above me and shielding. this isn't real, i am not here again. sink in, i don't want to remember. i want to hide, and cry, and be alone, and just. not. remember. i want to protect and shield and close up and pretend all over again. silence. that bitter empty silence again. fighting every fucking day to justify why i should be here, why i am here, why the battle is worth the fight.  upset. remembering.  you wouldn't have come anyway. i didn't ask, but yet i waited. like every birthday before, or performance, or something significant in my life. two years. nevermind. nevermind racheal, it's all in the past. lock it and throw away the key. store it in that big gigantic yellowing life book. another lesson learned. another though dissected. another fucking memory. im okay. it's all fruit loopingly peachy.

      sixteen things and seventeen that don't make sense. another doctor's appointment, the aroma of french vanilla soothing...nothing and everything in between. nothing is everything that seems it is.  words that splutter like a dying engine, splintering waves of clear cut edgy bullshit. daily everyday stresses and fresh cut roses from our backyard.  dinner at los rancheros and fajitas that make your cheeks burn and your face red. alcohol desperation but medication restrictions. on and off and on and off.  buddy lists and friends and exes and strangers. conversations and more conversations. pictures, new hair, very red, very short. more valentine gifts.  everday is a valentine. talking in short insignificant gibberish sentences.  cold. blankie on my freezing toes and mood color-changing nail polish. blue and purple, blue and a little purple, blue and specks of silver glitter and white. ashron and unreal and marvelous three and corgan wailing you to sleep.  "there's so many of these crazy little things,"

      surviving cancer is strange thing. i watched an episode about self-euthanasia (can't spell it, i know) last night,  that hits me in all the places it really shouldn't.  ryan and i talked about it a while ago, our baby girl's middle name is going to be akari. i still miss her, but it's all good you know? it's all good.  there is a heaven, i know that, i'm sure. there must be...and in this heaven place are all the people i love, and they are all happy and free and it's all good. ....right?

      seeking approval is a strange thing. being thrust a gift is even weirder. remarkable. this time crying, but crying good. good tears i mean...very good. a big sense of relief, of acceptance. a big sense of suddenly feeling okay...a calmness wahed over and a river flowed. friendship, a gift. thank you.   thank you.   thank you.   thank you, like sorry, doesn't ever seem to be enough sometimes.   a strange surreality, was this real?  did it really happen.   you know me well indeed.

      churning, something deep within me spirals back down into that lonely pit. it's as if invisible barriers put themselves back up in place and i am taken away into solitary confinement. this place where my mind just digs in deeper and deeper, scratching it's paws against the soils of depression and it's a pit in here. i wish i could cry, sometimes, it's hard to even do that anymore. no, i don't mean that...i mean cry. like really cry. baby sobbing careless humiliating disgusting crying. i miss those days on days like today. where crying it seems, would make things better.   i miss..this. everything. i don't know. i miss not knowing or knowing too much. i miss her, that girl, the bitch whore slut cunt. i miss identifying with her, being able to put a label on how shitty my existence is. a drip of this and a drop of that yet uncontrollably, everything is still as is.   long days, short days, terrifying days, nice days. it's like a nightmare that repeats itself over and over again, here i am, hello, my name is your bitch. i am manic-depression.   fuck you manic depression.   insecure. how can it be to feel so secure and insecure at the same time. high and low. happy and sad. right but wrong.   i should go to bed. insomnia only feeds to the mania, and it pushes me further down into this sinking sinking drowing feeling. hopeless.   deep jarring red words scream at me in my mind. they pound on me and drive daggers in...piercing. bleeding. crimson so fucking red. pain. why?  why me?  why this?  as always, the self-pity and self-destruction begins.  as always, tommorrow is a new day and i will try, try, then try again.   as always.

      cross-legged, thin...very. there's a certain immaturity i recognize, that same bright eyed aspiring bullshit i had when i started. i watch her as she takes her first few steps...i know that look. that confident insecurity.   i try to convince myself that she isn't me that i'm looking at...but there are so many similarities. i hate it. i hate her. i'm jealous. i'm jealous because i recognize that strange happiness you have when you're in between...and i think that's where she's at. it threatens me in some strange weird way, she tries to reach out and i snap back at her. i know she seeks my approval somehow, in this fucked up mess i am in, she looks up to me. and it's strange. shit, strange doesn't even begin to describe it.   i could put myself in her place, i had that look once. i am comfortable, yet comfortable has a rather sinister ring to me. was i happier then then i am now? no, not really. i cannot possibly have been....could i?  this brain numbing epiphany that hits me like the raindrops that pour harder and harder against my back. i am running, for cover maybe...or just running. salvaging my wet dying disposing ciggarette.   no, no...don't turn into me.   there are more things too, things i refuse to admit right now because my pride is too messed up to be fucked with right now. things i don't want to face, much less admit.   but i know it's there.   i know that's why i don't like her.   can't stand her.   i know why i get irritated when she talks to me, or tries to me my new best friend.   i'm trying to psychoanalyze this...shit, i'm always up for helping someone. anyone. anybody out of this same exact path of hell hole i've lived in...but there are too many similarities. i don't know if i can help her. i don't know if i can help me.  holy fucking mother of god shit.   this is scary.  scary strange.  very strange.   fuck.

      he plays weird music on the stereo. some jiggy ba-doo-dah bullshit from the seventies. at least it sounds like the seventies anyway. we're going on a trip...an 'adult trip' as jessica puts it.   the room is strangely cold in here, yet i am warm. how do i do that? manage to feel warm and cold at the same time?  we made love on the couch last night. suddenly aroused from watching law and order, don't ask me why. i stroked his manlyhood and rubbed it against my breasts. feeling.   felt him deep inside me and moaned. soaked in all that was us as he whispered i love you, i love you. harder, softer, faster, slower...now, please, now.  right.  there.   we're going for a trip together in two weeks. it's our first racheal and ryan holiday together. yum.   love must be this...listening to avenue q together and laughing our asses off. calling to say i love you. picking up, dropping off, and picking up again. love must be laughing and crying in bed together, love must be waking up to the one you love. or being jolted from an awful screaming nightmare and feeling safe secure arms around to soothe you. love must be making mash potatoes and meatloaf turkey, grocery shopping, planning a life together. love must be waiting at the doctors office with nerves and more nerves and having someone share it with you. love must be about buying your first set of plates and owning a home together.   love must be about giving and taking. sharing. learning. forgiving. yes, love must be most of all be about forgiving. for the little things, the big things and the smaller ones too. love must be about knowing when you are wrong and when you are absolutely damn right but able to take the fall anyway.  love is about patience.   love is about experience.  love is this.   all that i know.  glass cases of mixed sand and warming together on the beach.   love is a warm cup of coffee in the morning with bagels and someone to share it with.   is this love?  is this right?  does anything that i say make sense at all?  love is about dating your best friend.   good or bad.   naughty or nice.  stupid or silly.  love is about wanting to stay forever.  and ever.  and ever.

        The Color Of Rain  Saturday, 7 Feb 2004 || 2004_02_07_2330.html     So what is this called again? What is the color of rain? What is this wisp of hair on your face that falls and waves so gently as you talk, but I hear only you soft muted voice blending into the. The..? I dont hear anything anymore. What is this lovely glow from your face that is illuminating my life? Then I hear you speak, that sweet voice asking me, as you touch my fingers briefly. The color of rain? you ask.  Well, it has always been pink for me.  You hold me in your arms and I inhale, filling my lungs with so much of you, so much more life than ever before. She turned around and gave him a smile while the rain continued to patter patiently outside.  Love, he whispered softly into her ear.   The color of rain for me is Love. Yours.  Thats how I'll always remember you.   ---   Looking Back Now  Thursday, 5 Feb 2004 || 2004_02_02_2230    It's not worth turning back for.  I went through my collection, leafing through the pages, and I saw yours. I touched it gently, yet it crumbled under my fingers, just like how you. I picked the fragments from my bed, careful to not leave any sharp pieces behind, careful to not get myself stabbed again.   And you said. Hey. I turned around, and I saw you. Hi. Come here, give me a hug. I stepped forward. Pangs of pain shot up my leg, and blood seeped between my toes.   You smiled. I didnt.  ---  I am at peace with myself when I am alone. Its called solitude. I like it. Is it cold where you are? No. Am in my apartment bedroom. Up so early? Havent slept. Stayed up in bed making stories in my head. Sleep. You need to rest. Sleep. Stories nice. Stories by the beach. Am always happy in the sytories. Nice. Sleep is secondary. Yeah? Then make stories with eyes closed. Thats what I do. Stories behind my eyelids. Happiness comes alive. Very nice. Yes, have a great day ahead. Hugs. You too. Smooch. Blush. :oD   --    it's been a while since 've read you...actually, it's been a while since i've read anyone at all. nestled in this little comfortable secure cocoon...of blocking out people and faces and pain...or so i think.    you, he, they, remind me once again that the memories never fade. you step one foot out your safety net and it's scary as hell. it's scary like the little demons are waiting to pounce on you and devour you alive. you inspire me. it is safe to talk, really. feel. write. i haven't written for so long...no, i don't mean that. i just mean that i haven't written really for so long.  there's this marshmallow in between that prevents me, i don't know how to unleash the skeletons from my closet.   thank you for the direction.

      a wave of nausea hits just right and i am praying to the porcelain gods again. it's as if you're fighting, and fighting....but sometimes, you win a little and lose a lot. a drawback, another one of those two steps forward and about sixteen steps back things. but it's okay, it's okay goddamnit, i am alright.   medicine. medicine out of my ass and in through my brains. pills for this and that and this and that. blood red nails run through the bottle cap, fuck me, it would be so easy...so fucking goddamn desperately easy. but i won't. fuck you racheal and your insecurities, and your stupid ass thoughts, and your stupid assholic manic depression, fuck you racheal, you are stronger than this. than all this pain, than all this self-pity destruction. you are bigger, better, less ignorant than this.   angry.   so fucking furoius once again at the girl in the mirror that stares back. you fat little shit face. you ugly useless moronic bitch. you good for nothing whore dick sucker cunt. and you can add as many expletives as you want, you can scream and draw and cry and fist up, but the overwhelming need to hurt yourself will always be there. you are better than this, racheal, you are better.   if you want to go down, you know you're damn well fucking good at it. you cna close up, protect, cry, spiral back into that empty dark place again. and i know now for a fact that you will never breathe, never come back up again. because your body, your mind, your soul can only take so much violent crude abuse.   so there's the part of you that's always struggling harder and harder to find the surface and not drown. it's that fragile fucking delicate balance of making the right decisions, doing okay, trying, being happy. it's you against the chemicals, against the enormous anmount of pressure.   you think way way too much racheal.   it's that part of you deep inside that knows above everything else, that you're really okay. the tiny little part inside of you that screams to be heard, that says just take your goddamn pills and shut the fuck up. the part that says you're a good person, that it's going to be alright. that you're really only nineteen and so what if you haven't found the cure to cancer or saved the world....so what?   it's the only part of you that's sane enough to say, you're just being stupid. or that you're overthinking again. it's the part that at least somewhat tries to shush the voices that blatantly scream at you, it's the little part that struggles to know that you are capable of love, that you deserve love, that you are enough, that you are just plain okay zipdodeedoo.   i'm doing real well in school, making straight a's and all that baloney. but the over-achieving perfectionist in me always yells back in me that IT'S NOT ENOUGH! somehow, i've convinced myself that i need to be this and that and this and that.   i am fucking in love with a man that adores me and loves me with the whole damn universe and takes me for who i am. and i don't know why i am still not happy, not recieving, not able to relax or convince myself that it's not all going to crash in the next second. that i can and will recieve this gift, that i should be loved, that i am an alright person to love.   i don't know why it's so hard to believe someone when they say that i am a good person, because deep down inside i feel rotten and ugly. i feel like god's gift to the demons to torment. i feel like shit.   and i keep telling myself that someday i will forgive myself, i will let myself go to the universe, i will be free.  bullfuckingshit.   i will live with this for the rest of my sordid amazing life.   i will live for the rest of my life having ups and downs. living the extremes. i will face good days and bad days, i will never ever forget how to cry or hurt or laugh. i will always be angry or bitchy or sarcastic or funny or adorable or cute. i will always be taken from one side to the other to the other.   i am anxious, and i am nervous as hell. it's as if i am always at a crossroad, always making decisions...finding myself and i cannot quit worrying. i cannot stop the 'what if's' nor the constant questioning on where my life is going, who i am, nor who i'll ever be.   i cannot stop the blackness inside of me that has lived for so long just to say, you're a piece of shit.   it's really just called self-pity and i still revel in it and say, i cannot do it.   but i can.  i can goddamnit.   life is so fucking confusing and fun and exciting and miserable at the same time.   fuck me.      ""Effortlessly"  I won't be so hard on me today I start to take myself so seriously Shouldn't be so hard just to be effortlessly It shouldn't be so hard to keep it together It shouldn't be so hard to say the right things to you It shouldn't be so hard just to be effortlessly  [Pre-Chorus] Weightless worries fall away Wasted pools of energy I want to know I want to breathe  [Chorus] Effortlessly - just be I want to be effortlessly I want to be  It shouldn't be so hard to be inspired It shouldn't be so hard just to write this song It shouldn't be so hard to be wrong or to agree It shouldn't be so hard to change the world It shouldn't be so hard just to change your mind It shouldn't be so hard just to be effortlessly  [Pre-Chorus] [Chorus]  I won't be so hard on me today I start to take myself so seriously Shouldn't be so hard just to be effortlessly  Effortlessly I want to know I want to breathe I want to simplify my needs I want to live inside this moment And just be effortlessly Just be I wanna be effortlessly I want to be"

      he lays sleeping next to me, arms curled around my shrinking waist...and i tilt just right so my tears escape him and wet the pillow instead. i listen to the night sounds as always, listening so hard for sounds i don't even know...waiting to be amused. comforted. soothed. the tears fall and yet i've mastered the fine art of crying softly. almost unheard...unseen. the voices in my head ravage and attack...they say i am ugly, worthless. they tell me i am a piece of shit. they break me down, and tear me apart. those voices are you, those voices are you in my head. you screaming, and yelling. me hurting. why?  stupid fucking voices.  he moves in closer, as if sensing my neediness. i cry a little harder, i cry like a little girl, rather recklessly unafraid of being caught. being caught of letting down my defenses, revealing that i still hurt, that i am still fragile, that beneath all the toughness and smiles, that i am still broken.  b ro ken.

      you left before i could say my peace. i'm not mad...i'm not even really hurt. if anything...maybe i feel like i'm at peace. like...i can finally maybe start to heal? i don't know. don't be sad. you've done nothing wrong. i think it's obvious after all of this who the bad guy really is. i read through all of this racheal, and i realize that...i don't belong anymore. all i am is a burden. you don't need me to fuck things up. i'm sure ryan doesn't need me around, fucking with his girlfriend. i know you love me...but is there really a way we can all coexist? it doesn't seem likely. i love you racheal. i love you with all my heart. i know it doesn't always seem like it...but that's because i'm shit with my feelings. don't worry about me...you might think i'm gone, but i'm not really. i'm never that far away. and even if you don't see me, you know i'm here. you know the hard way that i have problems letting go. congratulations on making it. nobody's happier than me that you have the life you completely deserve. i'm just sorry that i'm not a part of it. but...that's also for the best. don't be sad anymore...not over me. you've cried over me far too much already. i'm not worth your tears. i'm not worth anything.  i'm sorry for raping your private space...but it's the only way i know to get ahold of you. but...you don't have to see me anymore. i'm so sorry.  thank you for being honest with me. i'm sorry that...fuck it. i'm just sorry. i'll go now. i've fucked up one too many times.

      i believe in an alternate universe where things are different, where everything is beautifully serene and intoxicatingly amazing.   ...cumbering into a low, just out of place and out of sync with feelings and things all around me that seem to crash and take place all at once. life is an open canvas and i am thirsting for oil paints to construct this picture.   big momma arrives tomorrow, and it's as if there is a crazy rush for everything to be just perfect. a midnight rollerblade stroll down ninth, holding hands under the night glow of yellow orange hues...some time to get away from it all awhile. relaxxxx he says....relax.   nit-pick the laterns in our room and everything has to be just right. study my ass off for another couple of months and then comes summer and more studying again. summer comes and i am alone again for another three months. there are times i think, how the fuck am i going to survive?...must you really really really really go to jersey? we have our tickets booked into new york for mid-summer from when i return home from malaysia. i'm spending a couple of days then school starts again.   sometimes it seems as if i am always running on empty, like my life is one big chaotic shit filled with seven hundred and fifty two things that needed to be done five minutes ago.   but that's just life.   and i suppose, i should really just deal with it.   not like i'm going to be going anywhere soon  ...or am i?

      it's mismatched strips of thoughts and feelings released. tokens of what there once was and what there still is. and sometimes, nothing can make sense but yet everything falls into place. the words that once empowered now broken reels of a time lost in space. quite a bit to go through, and leafing it page by page is an indefinite surge of emotions that range from so little to so much. falling asleep in bed, listening to the night sounds and him and crying, sobbing into his chest and asking why and how and where the hell do i go from here? i don't know if it hurts more that he understands or if it's the senseless guilt trip that your mind plays on you. you do not want to cheat on him, but to allow yourself to feel seems like betrayal on a strange degree. he says it's all going to be okay. and for that moment, there is nothing else in the world that you would like to believe, that there is nothing else in the world that matters and all that there is, all that it is is now, and time, and place for moments to happen. allowing yourself to love and be loved. a sacrifice of sorts to be made, a painful memory, but nonetheless, one you'll have to live with.  he says you are specially oversensitive. that no one else in their right mind will still be here, i say it's love. and he says maybe that's why loving me, all that i am, means so much. because i take every little thing into consideration, and i look, hope, when no one else is looking. is it possible to love two, three, a million people at once?  the day after, a strange dejavu like mist of the mornings after a fight, or a breakdown, feels the same. it's all a haze.   i am tired, and so is the rest of the world with my bullshit. the room needs to be cleaned, and the dishes need to be washed. the dogs and even miss evil cat sits patiently behind closed doors waiting to be let in, to be stroked and to comfort. why so sad? why so angry? why so anything at all?  i have found the one, just like i thought i had many times before. he is special, and he understands. he says he's banning me from the computer, because everytime i come back in to the house i have the look on my face that says my grandmother just died. and so for the next few hours or so, he pays for my mistakes. he pays for my insecurities and needing, he pays for my unability to let go and the fact that i feel too much. and sometimes, i save conversations for him to read, for him to understand...because sometimes i know, try as he might. he doesn't. there's the other guy, and no one will ever take his place, he knows that by now, and so i wonder how strong of a man you must be to let your girlfriend comfort someone else, love someone else, cry for someone else, and just to take it all. there are times where i know he deserves nothing of this. but times also where i know, there is a reason that he has lasted for so long, for all the nights, for all my insanity.  he gets down on knees and hands, scrubbing the bathroom floor sparkling clean for my mother. i let him do all the dirty work and as always, he has to deal with the extra baggage. i am useless, but i am something with him. i am the love of his life, and the one he comes home to. i am the person that needs him like no other and smiles through stupid crazy projects. i have found love, and summer nights, i have found the meaning to all the answers i was searching for....i am a stronger person, a better lover but yet still the same broken mended pieced together girl. not quite yet the woman i long to be.   there are days where i feel like i know what i have to do. and there are days where i don't at all.   i know that i had to go through all that i went through to get to where i need to go. but sometimes, it's the in between that seems the hardest of it all. that everything has consequences. that to shut out love like i did for a while is an impossible task. that things happen, and situations change, and piece by piece, no matter how wrong, fall together in place. i met so many mr. wrongs to meet two mr. rights. and so i'm weighing them, testing the one i'm with and driving the other into insanity. and i knwo deep in my heart that the one i'm with is the one that i'm meant to be with for the rest of my life. if only because i don't think i will ever find another person that can stand in the midst of a tornado and be calm. i laugh so much more just like i used to, i have found the little girl i used to be but am yet maturing into a woman. i have found responsibilities, responsibilities that i never wanted but have been taught to accept. patiently, and sometimes screamingly, he teaches me what life is all about and all that it is. what it means to grow up and accept everything, accept who i am as who i'll be.   i loved someone a long time ago like nothing i had ever loved before. i gave my all, and sometimes, it scares me to think that giving my all wasn't enough. that i wasn't enough. and so sometimes, when i am doubtful, i have to remind myself that i am okay. that the world is an okay place and that i deserve to love and be loved. i was so broken, and i am embarassed that he has read all the things i never said before but comforted that he finally realizes now, that i did love him, and that i did try, and that i did wait forever.   i'm sorry. sorry for so many things but sometimes not at all. there will always be memories, and places in time that will take me back into a different era. i broke, and in the end, i didn't wait. i left. and sometimes, i feel guilty for that, but then i look at my life now and i cannot imagine the person i would have become if i was still as hurt, as broken, as torn down as before. i would not be the person that they both love without the things, the memories, the times. i had to leave, and i had to break my promise, and i had to go....and i know nothing in the world will ever justify that. will ever make it okay.  sorry, like so many other times before, sorry. but never sorry that it happened. ever.

      memories hit hard, bullet train.  pain, hurting to remember, sometimes you want to say why bring it up? but then you remember that everybody needs to talk it out sometimes. and so you try to suck it in and understand and comfort. comfort him, comfort yourself.  painful memories, times. days. moments.  nights, days, evenings, birthdays, musicals, plays, watching the stars in a foreign place.  a foreign place you've learned to call home, a place you've come to find love, a place you will leave soon and journey on into maturity and growing up and all the crazy things it entails.  love hurts sometimes, and loving someone does too.  letting go is the hard part, but never forgetting is harder.  you don't what if it anymore, and you know deep in your heart that it's for the better, that you are better now. that you've changed, that you're different, that circumstances and life, and your stupid crazy neurotic mind happened. weak, struggling for air sometimes, feeling so tiny and insignificant and insecure.  i hated the me when i was with you, i hated the me that we both drove us into.  why is there so much pain from something that was once beautiful?  but i'm okay now, and i am happy. if only just for a while. and sometimes, it makes me feel so guilty. so guilty because i know you aren't happy. guilty because i never know what's right to say? to want to agree but know it will hurt you at the same time.  to understand but not at all.  soemthing that seems so right is questionably so wrong.  we were talking last night and i mentioned la. about how if things had gone right that everything that happened between him and i wouldn't have. and that was a strange eerie feeling.  would i have given up the life i have now to have the life i might have had with you? i don't know, but when i left, i thought i did.  it was another crossroad, and deep inside, i know i took the right one, yet the right one hurts you so much.....now how the hell again is this right? but this, now, him and i. i know i wouldn't have what i have with him without you.   it's so fucking complicatingly hard sometimes.

      there are times where i honestly believe that loving me, all that i am, is an impossible thing to do. impossibly hard to do at least. i know this from conversations with the exes, the random mood swings that go from one extreme to another...the fact that i am a selfish fucking bitch....ever sit alone with your thoughts awhile and just absolutely hate yourself?  i'm in one of my strange moods, it's the in between stage of being weird and semi-depressed. thinking too much and trying to process everything, trying to fix everything that subconsciously i know, do not need fixing. the overthinking stage in which you nit-pick everything fucking dry. the part where you smoke so much you know you're going to someday die of lung cancer.   i've been reading journal entries and i realize that all i ever talk about, all that i ever am, all that i am made about is anger, and sadness, and madness. and of course, that makes me angry and sad and want to do crazy things.   i'm whining again. so just insert about seven of my last entries and you will have exactly how i feel.   fuck  me.

      preparing for death must be a strange thing. yule is pretty much teterring on death's door, it is weird. correction, it must be weird. all these funeral arrangements to make, caskets i'd like my body to be put in, living wills to sign, morphine drips to get high on.   this place smells exactly the same five and a half months later. padded walls and looming big fences that cage you in. there are the insane wails and screams down the hall, blank faces and aneroxic fat ass girls. guys with absolutely no comprehension of manners and the psych techs looking looking looking.   same place, same feelings, same thoughts, different faces.   a place to 'get stabilized'. a place where they drug you incestantly that there is no comprehension of anything whatsoever. so you don't kill yourself. so you don't fucking cry yourself to death, or slice your arms and legs apart. so you just don't. anything. at. all.   i'm in a funny place. take it literally, take it metaphorically.  i really don't give a shit.   i hate it when people tell you that you're smart and beatiful and amazing and yet you feel like nothing and am nothing. i hate it that my mirror is never quite the same as the reflection someone else's sees. i hate it that i feel like absolutely nothing and everything sometimes. i hate it that i get so high so high and crash crash crash further, way further than where i started. i hate the one step forward three steps back theory. i hate theories and theraphy.   i feel like robert in 'proof'. the machinery is fucking flying and i am insane.   talking in codes and mathematical errors and solutions and fucking conspiracies.   i am angry.

      i'm a nervous wreck like a fucking twit at the moment. don't ask me what it's about...just, i don't know...N.E.R.V.O.U.S.  every fucking little thing is freaking me out, it's like my neurotic ass brain is on speed and i can't breath and my heart is beating way too fast. i feel like i want to scream and hit something and tap tap tap tap tap.   i had a dream about a portion of my teeth falling out the other night, apparently, that is significant. i haven't taken my anti-psychotic, anti-depression, anti-anxiety pills in about a good three months. that's probably really bad but, fuck, i don't know. i really should reschedule my appointment with the doctor, only that i don't want to, and i'm sick of this shit.   so fucking many things to do and think about and just fucking do.   it's spring break and i'm about to check myself into the hospital.   fanfuckingbloodyfucktastic.

      liberated...liberation. it's like a feeling of letting go, being happy, screaming on top of the mountain and just falling down, freely...flying. soaring, soaring so high and fast your cheeks are plastered into a smile by the wind contorting you face. the sound of laughter, cackling, laughing so hard you can't stop. the sound of music, filling your ears. dancing alone, revelling, having a fucking blast in the twisted fucked up mind of yours.   i am on a high, or at least, i am moving into a manic state. i cannot sit still and i want to laugh and laugh and laugh. i think it might have to do with my diet pills, the caffiene surge, ephedra free bullshit that jacks up your metabolism and makes you want to do crazy things. or maybe it's my new pills that at the moment, are working absolutely perfect. painfree, bloodfree, stressfree. a first in a long long time. or maybe it's that i have a fucking 4.0 gpa this term, a stark difference from my shittingly failing bastard ass results last term. i am happy.   maybe it's that i am allowing myself to dream, to pursue things that i have wanted to achieve for so long. that i am finally letting myself say, you can do it. and you'll be just fine. perhaps it is the extra touch of confidence he gives me, the one where he listens, listens to me when i talk. and helps me solve the weight of the world that's on my shoulders. the one that says deep breath, it will all fucking work out! and it is, it has, oh my god, it is working out.   and i mean every little fucking detail. it's like a catastrophic ephipany and i don't know what to do with myself. so many fucking ideas, the will to be creative, the acceptance of being just you, the permission to live and dream, the desire to see things through.   i am bursting and smiling and raving and dancing all at the same time. on a high that spans from so many different things.   am i crazy?  is this real?  i am happy. i am happy and that's a weird feeling. i don't think i've felt this happy in a long long time. i don't think i've ever been this happy or free or just plain fucking okay.  this is weird.  wow.

       urlLink      the performance last night was weird..stoned throughout the whole thing...popping painkillers and running through lines, acting. singing, breathing in hard through my lungs with my diaphragm, all the painstaking hours upon hours of lessons in a cloak room comes rushing back. the applause shatters with wolf whistles and cat calls, ryan must have paid them to cheer for me.   the tapes came out interesting, i  watched  critiqued it harshly...things i could have done better, things i didn't like...my face, my fat ass, my bright ass red hair and the lighting.   one night only, i smile straight into the camera and away, revealing too much and nothing at all..masking with characters and slathering fish scales. flying, a cacophony of voices within fighting to be heard...the final curtain, one last bow. joining hands with a cast that pulled together and smiling. running backstage.   wanting to get the fuck out of here.   life is so weird when you're bordering(bothered) and looking through.

      i've been reading...it's weird to sit and flip through someones life that could in so many ways be yours...words, pain, feelings, things you think no one else understands, feelings you think no one else can comprehend. weird.   i've got meesh to thank, i got bored and and was browsing through her links and came across her..  so. weird.   i read about second chances and fucking up, i read about pain and tears and slashing your wrists, i read about hope and love and lots of shopping. i read about this and that and this and that and i was mesmerized.   it's nice to know that on the far other side of the world, someone thinks very similarly like you.  scary.   urlLink  "Perhaps I have less skeletons sitting, collecting dust in my closet (although to be honest, I doubt that to be true)... or could it be that I have finally begun to say to myself ... "To hell with it... I am just who I am and should not try and hide it." I don't know..."

      we went out to take photos last night...a memory of moments in time captured. we sifted through a bunch of other things, a bunch of other moments..and it was weird to not recognize but to have some sort of inkling of a different period in time. growing, learning to be independent...sprouting wings.  it's hard not to cling on to security, it's hard to relax, take things a day at a time, a minute...a second.  it's hard to say this is okay, hard to not worry yourself to death.  crouching, hurting, crying for the girl in the pictures. the low light glows, a series of breaking down, being so sad. a cycle continued daily, weekly, monthly. escaping the madness, the in between, the uncertainty of tomorrow or the day after and the day after that.  nostalgia is a strange strange gift, you make mistakes and learn, you take all that you know, all that you've come to know in strive and sometimes you get bruised so easily. sometimes the scrapes and scars seem so much more than they really are.   he somehow managed to pull some strings, yell at some people and so tomorrow we're going to see the doctor. and i have to somehow be honest about how i'm feeling yet be cautious of what i say. catch 22 is an evil thing.  i want to get better, it isn't that i tell him. it's just hard to find a secure balance to thrive on. and i don't want to go back in....i really don't. i hate the smell, i hate the darkness that creeps into your skin, i hate the feeling of hopeless hope.   there's so many things i need to do, the musical on saturday, auditions tomorrow and hopefully, callbacks on wednesday. finals coming up, registrations, preparations, production meetings. if anything, i don't need more time to sit around to think about things...."but they need to regulate your medicine honey" regulate my ass. they dick around with my pills so much it's green one day, purple the other and blue the next. and there's always the misdiagnosis of just what the hell is wrong with me. borderline, truly, unknown.   but i'm fine.  and nobody listens.   just leave me the hell alone....i'll fucking figure it out.

      sometimes i think god forgot to put the connector between fuse a and fuse b in my head.   ...if there was a god anyway.  things don't really make sense at the moment....all these internal voices clanging around and pressure pressure pressure.  they're threatening to baker act me, yeah, stick me again for a couple of days in the loony bin and everythings going to be just. fine.  sure.  exactly.  uhuh.  you ever have crazy thoughts running through your head?  i threw up for the first time in a lot of months last night, panicked. i don't know.  things don't fucking make sense at the moment.  i feel crazy, possesed...on fire with no fuel, crashing so fast it's a big huge blur.  catatonia is a nice place to be sometimes.  yet this everchanging madness that takes inside always takes a different form...it is essentially the same thing with a different variation, a twist of some sort.   i'm not suicidal, yet i do want to hurt myself.   how the fuck does that make sense?  and it isn't so much about the pain anymore, it isn't so much about going away some place.  i just feel so...out of control. and sometimes, that makes me very afraid of who i am, what i'm going to do, what happens next.  it's all the extremes, it's all the anxiety and worrying and crying and hurting and everything. every bloody single stupid fucking thing for absolutely nothing at all.  it's being at a crossroad without any fucking roads at all, it's putting on the gravel and tar to what, you're not exactly sure.  it's needing to do something but not knowing what is.  everyone says go in, take a break for a while, escape reality. don't you understand you stupid morons that it's all goign to be the same anyway? that you can't just lock me away from the real world because in the end, i am going to be back there anyway?  that the medication doesn't fucking work?  that my mind just got wired completely fucking different from the others and it's so hard to make it okay.  that i try, oh god, i try every fucking bloody day to stay on top, to try try try, to not do stupid things, to not kill myself, to not hurt myself, to be the best, to be superwoman, to handle every fucking thing?  and this is what scares me..  that if before i had so many things that was going wrong in my life to just say, you need a break and those things are making you crazy.  what do i have now?  what can i possibly blame it on except for myself.  one day i'm going to drive the people around me away.  an inevitable thing i've come to learn.  but yet he sits there night after night, reassuring and reassuring again. listening to my sorry ass make excuses for being me, loving me. phone calls, visits, they come and ask and pressure and support and this and that and this and that. i'm trying, but my trying isn't good enough.  why am i never good enough?  i really just want to be normal.   yeah, normal would be nice.

      we were hanging out in the house today, him putzing around trying to build the underwater housing for his camera and me just not really doing anything at all...and somewhere in between "honey what should we make for lunch" and "lets go paintballing" i burst into tears. i don't know why or how it came about except that i was shaking and so sad....not quite knowing what was going on or why some demon in me opened up the gates of hell. he held me for the longest time ever, just me curled up and bawling and him holding. protecting...asking again and again why baby why why why.   ....is there ever really a why?

      you wouldn't think that it'd be possible to have absolutely everything go wrong in one day but knowing my luck, of course it does.   we begin with getting up late for church, trying to take a shower without killing each other because it's fucking freezing and we both want to be standing under the hot water at the same time.   ....then realizing halfway through that it's sunrise service and we should have been at church only about three hours ago.  fuck that.   so we strip off our nicely ironed clothes and let them rot in a pile by the bed and grumpily climb back between the sheets only to have zigi and sasquatch wired as fuck wanting to play. lock them out of the room and go back to la la land.  skip a couple of hours later (yeah right, try in the middle of the freaking day) and now ryan's late for work and he's flustered so i'm flustered and hands and limbs fly everywhere trying to find this and that and get this and that.   chop some things up together for lunch, finally take a break to watch some tv and sort through my mail because i haven't had time to do anything lately and sitting right on top of the pile is a freaking ass bill around the tune of 1400 dollars for my little visit to the loony bin the other day.   fuck.  me.   fluster around again for another couple of hours trying to figure the hows and whats and why the hell my insurance isn't covering it or just the blatant fact that i have to pay for my summer and fall tuition by the end of this month which by the way, runs about 3600 a freaking term because i am charged the international rate and nevermind that my parents have money coming out of their asses but shit. that's still a lot of freaking money and the last thing on bloody earth i need and want to bring up to them is the other little 'incident' where their stupid ass daughter has mental fuckupness.  FUUUCCCKKKK!!?!!@?!@>!?#@!?$@?#%$W?^4  so what do i do?  being the domesticated bitch i am, i resort to cleaning.   i take off all our sheets and decide that freshly laundered sheets would be great and the fucking ass dryer breaks down and because it's freaking easter sunday, nothing is open.   nervous breakdown. nervous breakdown. nervous breakdown.  key and solution to it all?  walmart.   ahhhh...walmart.   i fight through crazy old ladies that tell you about their life stories while you're picking out zuchinnies and crying babies that won't shut the hell up and get lost in flourescent lights, cheap ass crazy easter deals, candles, more candles, (latest and ongoing obsession) and check out ladies that are way way too bubbly for a shitty day.   i come home and i decide i'm going to make a nice lovely romantic dinner for the both of us only that i don't know how to cook or kill or mutilate these freaking live lobsters and one of them seems to have bitten/chewed/fucked up the rubberband on one of their claws between the ten minute drive home from walmart. so in comes more hysteria and madness and THE FUCKING ELECTRICITY BLOWS OUT.  yes.   stupid fucking old ass piece of shit house.   i don't pay 800 dollars a month to a. get carbon monoxide poisoning, b. have a huuuuge stupid ass backyard with trees that won't stop fucking shedding leaves, and c. most of all, to have no electricity.   ryan comes home, bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch (who else am i going to bitch to?) calls the old ass landlord and he sends out the FIRE COMPANY? why? i don't know. ryan flips on the breaker and the whole house goes crazy because the circuits are fucked up and our lights are blinking, blinking, blinking, the stove isn't working, i've got fucking live lobsters in my sink and the house seems like it's going to explode.   and what's the sane racheal thing to do?  run with my passport and sit in the car.   at this point, looking back on it, it's fucking hilarious and would make good grounds for a farce/comedy play thingamagic.  cut back to the nice big red fire engine truck that pulls up and big burly yummy men that come in and go through everything only to switch off our power because it isn't safe.  duh, you stupid fuck.   call back our landlord and the bastard doesn't pick up.  make fucking dinner on our GRILL.  trying to boil water in candlelight on the grill just doesn't work for me honey. creative yes, but so wrong.    finally go to bed with no sheets, no electricity, absolutely no mood for sex whatsoever, grumpy, and the little grocery shopping i did in the evening, rotting, because hey, refridgerators need fuckinig electricity to work.   -------  aftermath.    the lakeview bill was a mistake on the wonderful people over there and so the wrote off the bill because i make no income whatsoever in america and poor me is just so pathetic and they can't blame shit on me because they baker acted me anyway. so hah!  the dryer didn't work because the fuses were fucked, hence the electricity madness because the lightning late saturday hit it somehow and it was all fixed and done with before i woke up because my boyfriend is a good little bitch. :)  the landlord apologized profusely and brought his ass down to the house at seven in the morning to make sure someone looked at it and had it fixed by noon.   aaa-fucking-men.

       Relationships V: Reclaiming yourself The problem with "looking for love. Real love. Ridiculous, inconvenient, consuming, can't live without each other love" is precisely that: they consume you. They take over your very being at the most intense level for what seems like the longest time only to leave you dry and whithered, worse for wear and drained of emotions shortly after. They swallow what was there, masticate your spirit and soul before spitting you out, transformed into something totally unrecognisable.  Crawling out of one of these relationships, whimpering out of a dogged and tempestuous existence, I find I no longer recognise myself. What was there, no longer is. What there is, is unfamiliar and foreign. Emerging from the tyranny of paradise on earth, I long to rekindle myself with the flames of old. I long to rediscover that spark that was me before and to find the identity that was "truly me".  But that, is the hardest thing about coming out of a "consuming, can't live without each other love": reclaiming yourself. After a trip to "can't live without you" land, you forget who you were or what you were about. After consuming a passionate, over-the-top love, it consumes you. It eats you up, burns your every fibre, worth and being before leaving an excrement that is only a shadow of what was. After crawling out of an oasis of decadence and luxury you face a barren dessert under the glaring light of a scorching sun - a light so bright that it illuminates the poverty of you and all that no longer is.  And that, is the biggest challenge: remembering who you were and truly are. Not as one half of an entity but as yourself. On your own. Standing on your own feet. Again. As you did before. With a name. An identity. A life. A value in and of itself. One to be cherished.  The act of reclaiming yourself is arduous, fraught with challenges and setbacks. It's never easy and most certainly not unilinear. I am overcome by emotions and obstacles every step of the way. One day I may make it, but today, I am trudging, unsuccessfully, through a mire.  jikon   we lied in bed last night talking, about life and the nothingness of the in between. we talked about the summer, and all that overwhelms me about it. we talked about my medication and changing perpectives; looking into the future and enjoying every little thing of the right now.   i layed in bed remembering this post, the all consuming us and how dysfunctional i am without the other half. how our lives have seemed to twine and tangle and it is hard to get away from us, or to know what life (summer) will be like without him. as he rubs my back and tells me i worry to much. i let bitter salty tears touch our pillows, and curl into his arms and cry a while more. i ask him about the skies and life and everything i need to know. i ask him for answers as he tries his best to give my questions a soothing answer.   we always have candles around the house, and as i look up from our bed i see our lanterns we've hung up so precisely around. i remember nights and moments and memories. and slowly, as he moves in me i thirst for more...i thirst to never forget this moment or to never forget what love is all about. i promise myself that i will never get jaded, that if this fails, that i will remember nights like these.   the way he looks at me, with respect, with love, with awe....with understanding.   so many things to do and so many thigns that need to be done. flying through amsterdam with a two week vacation back home that doesn't feel nearly enough. singing in the rain and watching the dancing shadows on my wall, i want every bloody thing and i am so needily insecure and alright at the same time.   i have no ending to a post because i am sitting here with thoughts racing through my head and seventeen different directions i could go.   relax, he says.   it'll still be here when you get back.   ---  i don't know how we got there....or why i flaunted the pieces of my soul nor why as i held the pieces, i cried.   i don't know why, i did the things i did, became the person i became, was the person i was.   i don't know why there are times i feel so incomplete, times like these...nights where i could sit here, smoke a cigarette, and still sit in the dark for hours asking the questions.   i don't know, i don't understand, i don't want to know.   ---  we're watching a movie and the lights are dim except for the neon red exit sign that blinks every so often. i hear people crunching their popcorn, a baby three rows behind me squirming and crying. the little girl with white blond hair that's turning around every so often to smile at me, iniatiate a conversation without words.   lost images, and so many of the little things to capture.  i feel like i am losing everything, my mind, my sanity, my grip on things. can you somehow be dragged through with earth stuck between your feet and shoes yet be soaring at the same times? because that's what it feels like sometimes, most of the time.   the yin and the yang, the ups and downs, the highs and lows.   losing control and not being completely happy but so happy at the same time?   bigger boobs, shorter hair, quieter...meeker in some sense. i look through archives and archives of pictures; it's funny how i truly believed i was ugly then...and now i see. i see what people told me, i see someone beautiful, someone worth loving, someone special.   will i look back at these pictures of me now and realize that i am beautiful despite all that i think of myself now?

      we're helping to produce an indie film that has to be shot, edited and ready by the end of april. god forbid i let myself get sucked into such exciting projects when i have my finals coming up. stupid ass.  and so the computer room is full of props and my mailbox with correpondence from the various crazy people i have to deal with.  why?  i don't know really.   i've had to iron sixty seven business suits while my boyfriend gets to wear jeans and another vintage punk shirt.  i did however buy new  cute  sexy underwear today.  a little something something after twelve hours of hard work.  :)  perhaps to make up for all the cute rocker grunge come-and-fuck-me sexy bands i have to deal with and their stupid ass label companies.   my boyfriend is more famous than me.   this sucks.  and just for the record, the new rule is that he can't check out the same girl i am checking out because that is just wrong.   :P  back to work.   gah.

       POETIC JUSTICE  Is when ten years on, in a most unexpected place, you run into the boy who was the love-of-your-time-in-Year-2 (before you changed schools and at some point clean forgot him), childhood crush you spent the whole year pretending to hate,   and you’re wearing your stilettos and   that   take-me-home-and-fuck-me lace-and-leather skirt  and you realize, standing there watching him flusteredly flattered,  that you’ve grown into the power of choosing  to lure but not to let him.    --  it's like lighting up your last cigarette on the wrong end then wanting to slap yourself silly but then an unexpected thing happens and he comes home with a carton just the way you like it right down to the slims.   it's like irritating the shit out of him and singing every verse wrong to every damn song because your brain is fried and your sense of memory is filled with stupid things.  it's like begging to play and turning him on because if he watches another episode of tripping the rift, or southpark, or clone high you.are.going.to.scream.  ...yet secretly, you watch it from the other computer too(between scrabble games)  it's collaborating and producing someone else's baby together. and him and them having not so secret conversations about you.  it's just this. midnight on a wednesday night with nothing to do, nothing to say. just doob dee doo.

      he plays that oasis song incestantly in the background...or maybe it's because it takes me to some place i don't know and soothes me. i am not complaining, in fact, humming, wailing with my heart on my sleeve. he laughs at my karaoke display, as he twirls me around in our computer room slash laundry room slash attic slash put whatever shit we don't want in the house.   mom left last night...or rather in the wee hours of the morning. somewhere in between four in the morning and six. i love how they make you go to the airport to check in two hours before your flight then decide to open the counter only at about five because no one in their right mind wakes up that early. right.   fucking retards.  i think i am in a haze of some strange unknown weird parallel. i've been off my medication for a couple of months now, i feel okay...a little up and down but still okay...or so i think anyway. i'm always okay.   they sat around checking each other out. her protecting her little grown up girl, miss hick and strange and weird and happy. him, our relationship and us and who we are and what we are becoming. she grills him, with questions about our future, and missouri...school, work, whatever she can think of. he listens, thinks about it, reassures.   i don't think it's so much as it is about her wanting to come for a visit as it is for her to accept us. accept this. this whole crazy madness that i tell her about. check us out...making sure i'm not getting my heart pulped with another ten suicide attempts again. wanting to make sure i'm physically, mentally and emotionally okay. wanting to talk talk talk talk to the doctors and ask six thousand and seven questions and go through charts and biopsies and projected results and stupid crazy motherly caring shit like that. i see now why they both get along so well...they worry they're fucking minds off.   she brings him this nifty little camera, a sony cam corder worth about a grand, and he films all these weird shit with it like me doing the dishes and our backyard and god knows who and what. he plays with it like a little kid and his bright new fire engines. my dad thought it was a fucking excellent idea, and so she carefully lugged it through singapore, and minneapolis, and colorado...back to minneapolis again and then florida. fuck yeah my parents are great people.   along with it she's brought three suitcases with everything and anything. undoubtedly pensacola is a tiny ass town but damn, mom! my maid's packed every damn spice and ramen noodles known to mankind and little snacks and stuff that i like because she's afraid i'm starving in big bad america. my dad's sent me nifty things like books and notes and money(!).   we shop for about ten straight days clocking a good six hours at every go as she fills it back up to take home. she's so tiny, my mom. but she fills up the room with her personality...it's funny how such a big laugh can come out of such a small person. she shows me the new highlights in her hair, and talks about home and my brother and the family. she tells me about isabel and how damn adorable she is now, how she's crawling all over the place and her face lights up. i've missed this, i've missed my mom and being at home and all the wonderfull familiar things.   yet at the same time, i cannot help but notice how different things are. how comfortable i am in my skin, my home. in my life, and my lifestyle and the way things fit perfectly. she's this city girl and finds my little town just so adorable. i see the things, the person i was when i first came here in her. ...and i wouldn't give up anything in the world for the maturity i've somehow gained nor the lessons i have learned.   i turn twenty in a couple of months more, no longer a teenager, a stepping stone away from a full blown legal adult. i've learned to embrace these moments, treasure these lessons of acquiring my wings to fly. i am no longer so much a little girl anymore, she tells me this. reminding me that they are proud of me, that i've somehow found my niche in life, this stability i've craved for so long. she gives me an extra boost to keep on fighting the good fight, to keep on trying no matter how many times i fall. and i am soaring, reaching for the skies and humbly caressing the earth, the soil that sifts through my fingers.   i am okay.

      oh my god.   i'm not sure i even know where to begin?   the beach was a fucking blast. and boobiliciously tit-ilaciously fucked up doesn't even begin to describe it!!!  i've never spend memorial day weekend here in pensacola, by this time of the year, i am mostly back in malaysia and raising hell there. sure, i've heard the interesting rumors and crazy stories my beautiful boys tell me....but oh fucking hell, nothing in the world prepares you for a weekend like that..!!  so my favorite sexy pants and i have been meaning to get together for the last week or so and finally he just calls me on saturday morning and tells me to wake my ass up and grab my swimsuit cause we're going to fucking celebrate gay pride weekend.   okay?  uhm.  yeah.  we go over to boobie's house who lives right on gulf breeze and the traffic is fucking insane. think 120,000 people on the beach, and about 1000 parking spaces, 500 cops and a whole lot of rainbows. the beach was so packed they started to turn the cars away and only let the trolleys and cabs through. so we are in bumper-to-bumper traffic for a good hour and a half and we have to fucking drive back to boobie's house and take a cab! arrghhh!!! lol, it was still fun though because our cab ride was a story in itself.  and btw, the heat is absolutely sweltering, i mean like your ass is fucking on fire. we finally get to the beach and i swear to god it was like culture shock.   there were a few hundred tents set out along the whole stretch, some elabvorately designed, some put together randomly, some just full of people upon people upon people. we meet up with our "posse", leave our shit and start walking.   pensacola bible belt my ass. there were at least 100,000 gay people, and enough of boobies and dicks to last me till the next memorial day weekend. lol, literally, chicks walking around naked, guys in fairy outfits, transvestites, bikini's and swimming suits of all sorts, the token old bald fat gay dude with speedos on. the guys got so fucked up it was hillarious. see the thing i love about hanging out with a whole bunch of gay people is that they are fantastic drunks. not only is their wit sharpened, their sense of adventure and excitement is aroused. in more ways than one.  so you flash your way through shots and tent after tent and by the end of the line, you're falling off your asses and laughing about sand.   and the great thing is, the cops don't do jack shit about it.  how exactly do you arrest 120,000 people? albiet, they're all not underaged drinkers but ohhhh yeah.   so there's wading pools and rainbow kites, gay pride stalls and the betty ford clinic, thousands and thousands of hot sexy sweaty chicks, and lots and lots of eye candy. yum double yum.  and to top it all, millions of parties to go to, leis and mardi gras beads strewn on you like a stamp of approval and as the tag line goes, "family gathering".  now, to go party hopping is one thing, but to go gay party hopping is a whoooole different story. and then at the end of the night, when you've hung up them stilletos and have retreated home with about 50 more people to come is another thing!  this weekend has been crazy, nevermind that i don't remember half of it, and nevermind that there were about 30 people i didn't know at my house last night, and nevermind that we're going to get bitched at on tuesday when the garbage disposal people come around from our tremendous overflow of beer bottles, and cans, and plastic jelly shot holder things, and shit i don't even know where to begin with...it's all good. because yesterday, was possibly the most damn fucking fun i've had in a while!  sweet fucking yeah!   :P

      i've been juggling schoolwork, sanity, entertainment, and being miss racheal in the last short months and it is crazily fun and insanely tiring at the same time.   there is weee waayynnee that lights up my sometimes gloomy world, something about the way he smiles up at you that makes your heart sing. something about the way his head rests perfectly between the nooks of your shoulder and head; magical. he is my special sweetheart among all the others (burp, sleep, play, change diapers, eat!...what more could you ask for?) and i think he knows it too.   then there are the other kids...the ones that kiss me when i don't expect it and hug me from behind, and underneath and upside down. the ones that go "do me! do me!" the ones that i color and make funny faces with. the ones that i instinctively pick up when crying, or that instinctively reach out for me. the ones that can't decide if they want shrek cereal or mac and cheese or cracker stackers for lunch. and then decide that whatever the other person is having is better after you've fixed it. (duh! miss racheal)   then there is samuel, samuel who only watches tv on movie day. samuel who only eats organic and nothing else. samuel who asks for his bwocolli at snack time. samuel who likes to be called thomas after his favorite toy train and whitney that likes to be called my pumpkwin. alex, who is one and teething and a major pain in the butt but a major tug in the heart too. alex who i have to watch out for, alex who has learned to shake his head and alex who will put absolutely anything and everything into his mouth. alex who likes to be rocked to sleep and only lets certain people hold him, and *will not* let you carry anyone else when he's in charge. :) jusdin bo judeen (justin) who has mastered the art of climbing out of his high chair, giggling like a hyena and is obsessive compulsive i swear. (every. thing. has. it's. place.) then there is hayley, the new girl who is a spitfire and absolutely cannot go night night with her shoes and socks on, who is convinced she is a princess and chooses pink for absolutely anything and everything and will sit in front of our play make-up area for hours and hours and hours(kid hours anyway) hallie, which is apparently a completely different sounding name from hayley, who is six but is almost if not more intelligent than me. the little girl that aces through the worksheets and then turns around and does a silly thing like sticking her head in between the chairs. dakota, my big boy of five years old, who follows me around and is my little helper. dakota, who gave himself a haircut and comes out with all these crazy stories to tell me that don't make sense but are so entertaining at the same time. anna lee, dakota's younger sister, that talks in that same crazy alabamian accent that confuses the living daylights out of me and is always one of the first to come up for a hug when i arrive. and finally courtney, courtney whom i truly believe will become miss america one day. she who reigns supreme on the others but gets so so so quiet when tired, she who sings and dances and shouts the loudest. she who forgets if you write flowing to the right or the tfel(left) then decides she's going to write hallie's name instead because it's easier.and she who makes the silliest faces and giggles the loudest. next to justin of course. who laughs for no apparent reason at times. (silly boy!)  i have shirts that are stretched beyond porportion from little hands tugging at every angle. not that that is anything to really complain about. i know more about shrek(their current obsession) than possibly anyone in this entire world or nursery rhymes. and i know this because for about two hours after i come home, and am washing the spit ups, grubby food fingers, and dirt from the yard from rolling around with the kids, out of my clothes, tending to the bruises and scratches for killer hands and feet and tiny bodies, i am singing about bloody rain drops and gumdrops.   so those are my days from about 12-7 on weekdays and i love it.   children are so crazy amazing aren't they?    p/s you want to hear a racheal is such a stupid dork story?   i turned a load of whites into pink. P I N K. gahhhhhhhh.   bodoh.  p/p/s have a great memorial day weekend! woohoo!! :)    urlLink  "Good God, why does it take so long to digest this honeycomb nonsense? I have bits of it sticking right into my teeth. Later folks, later. I must be my charming self and smile at Old men in 10,000 dollar suits. Sigh."

      we had a damn successfull garage sale this weekend that amusingly enough, brought in all different walks of life. there was the flea market woman that bitched about being american and great old america, the little african american kid that played with all our toys and begged his mom for more quarters and change, this strange blue haired lady that just about overturned and messed up every. little. single. thing. then there were the others, the art teacher, the homemakers, the lurkers that just sorta hung around for a while and walked away with a fifty cent book, strangers. passing on a gift. giving away a part of my life that i don't need anymore...books that i had pored through the middle of the night, clothes that i had worn through phases, lamps and shades, cultural and decorative ethnic shit, photo frames, teddy bears, couches, armoirs, jewelery cases, chains and necklaces i worn so many times before, each with a different story.   it sorta reminded me about my blogging friends, how we all give and take something to each other. how we are so different, from different cultures and backgrounds, a melting pot of sorts that have just sorta come together.  and i could not help but reminince(sp?) about last summer.   i flipped through my archives into a turbulent  urlLink month  of self-discovery and passion. hope and friendship. laughter and tears. beginnings and endings.   and these were the quotes i would remember forever, the quotations full of innuendos and personal secrets, of moments where you just had to be there to understand, of stuff i couldn't even begin to describe:   urlLink  "So here's to friendships (old and new, lost and found). Here's to pictures and yelling and naughty antics. Here's to the White Queen, flitting about, dropping fairy dust, dimpling her way into our hearts. Here's to more meetups, and more shared laughs and tears. And finally, here's to life. Wonderful, glorious life."      urlLink  "The conversations... the screams... the curses... the profanities The laughing... the drinking... the smoking... The sweet talk... the naughty talk... the cuddling... bordering foreplay"      urlLink  "How can anybody describe what it was like last night?"      urlLink  "Jamie, I swing every way."      urlLink  "But let me learn, let me make my own mistakes, brush the grit and dirt off and try again. I might cry, I may be difficult, and I may whine about never wanting to live/love/try. But let me wallow till I can wallow no more, and I will be fine. I will get up and try twice as hard. "      urlLink  "I was at the Light Side of the Force table before shifting to the Dark Side."      urlLink  "How long did it took you to figure out the tap in the washroom?"      urlLink  "the weekend was warped, and the only reminder i have that anything happened at all is the black nail polish on my pinky, a slightly sore throat and exhaustion. and my hair still smells slightly of cigar..."     that night was possibly one of the happiest nights i've ever had, and it was all because a bunch of people i hardly even knew bothered enough to come together.   thank you.  for every person that showed up that night, for every hug and kiss and word of encouragement.   i will treasure those moments forever.    ...and now for the  urlLink incriminating drunk off my fat ass photos . (thank you alex)  lu punya pasal lah!!!     urlLink  "I am not ashamed of who I am nor am I ashamed of the size of my ass. You figure out which one is a lie."

      we spent about three hours lazing at the beach yesterday, me laid out like a beach whale with strawberries, sandwiches, capri suns, vegetable tray, and wally lamb(she's come undone).  ...and now i look like a crisp plump tomato.   lol, i got a tan alright...with lines and little triangles across my chest and milkyway. i look strange, i am golden brown on certain parts of my body and red red red on others.   bethany and jessica don't seem to have survived the uv rays either...much as we slathered the spf45 lotion.   the beach is absolutely gorgeous at the moment. miles and miles of white sandy shores and twinkling various shades of exquisite blue that disappears in a distance.   living here, i think i've taken for granted just how amazing the scenery is. pensacolians are some lucky sob's as jessica said.   when i first moved to florida i lived in the outskirts of the city and the bay was my backyard. literally. i remember laying out on the dock at night to watch the stars, or do my homework.   i've now moved to the city to be closer to school and civilization. albiet the beach is still fifteen minutes away, i've learned to appreciate it so much more.   even with the damn fucking tourists.  :P  speaking in which, 50,000 gay men and women are expected on our shores this coming memorial weekend. it's like a yearly flight down south apparently, and trust me, this should get very interesting.   "dip me in chocolate syrup and feed me to the lesbians!"

      i think i've just been offered  the  most amazing job ever!   urlLink adele (the sister i never had) has offered to fly me to belfast for the summer to look after their baby daughter, arriana. flight, food, lodging provided plus extras.  how fucking ass amazing is that?  on a normal day, i take care of about ten kids for about five hours or so after class. sure they get cranky, and baby wayne cries for reasons you cannot comprehend, and smelling like curdled milk is a bitch but everyday that i leave, i cannot wait to come back for more. don't ask me why, it's the mother instinct in me.   now the only problem is that i have classes running all through summer and books that i've already paid six grand for. i have a three week break right before the fall term starts and i contemplated spending that time in belfast but then after weighing the pro and cons, i realized that i would really like to go home most of all. stuff myself silly with nasi lemak and be a spoiled brat.   so yeah, GRRR.  ...so. close.

      i wasn't going to blog today, but the events that lead up to last night prompted something, struck a cord i suppose.   we were sitting by the red light along davis, and across the intersection was an old lady stopped, waving, desperate. she'd ran out of gas, and i think i whispered something in the lines of "aww". i was going to suggest we stop and help, but there were so many things we had to do that day...and so little time.   the old man, a person i admire and respect, a person that inspires me everyday of my life, turned around, went out of his way to help. this man of fifty years, graying hair, did not think twice about flashing his lights and weaving between traffic to help someone else. he, all about a hundred and seventy pounds of him, helped pushed her car.   but what hit me most about that moment was that the truck in front of us, a black dodge with a fresh trip from home depot or lowes made the same weaving, cutting the major intersection to help. and they were just these two tiny little old man, completely white hair and all. i stopped to look at the people that stopped to help, a black woman with a green minivan, a middle aged guy with a full suit and tie, another man just out of nowhere.   i was so comforted and dissappointed at the same time. this is a major highway, a constantly used road that ferries college students just like me to and fro. and not once did i see someone of my age stop to help, and not once did some frat boy jock say, let me take a few minutes from my day to help someone in need. instead they honked, and cursed. instead they drove right by selfishly. instead they turned a blind eye to just an old lady stopped by the side of the road. because it wasn't their concern. because it wasn't about them. because it didn't bother them in the slightest bit except that she had now caused them the trouble of having change lanes.  and to be honest with you, i don't know if i would have stopped. or if i would have said, oh i'm just tiny little me, what can i possibly do? or if i just would have drove past and said i hope the next person helps her. or this, or that, or....everything else but stopping.   the old man reminded me that our generation has lost the meaning of selflessness to it. how many times does the word i,me,mine,myself appear in my blog? way too many times. and all the things that i can say to defend that are only excuses because truthfully, we do live in a selfish world.   the first lesson i ever learned about selflessness was from my mom. she's stopped to pick up this elderly couple by the side of the road about two blocks away from her office. i don't remember their faces anymore, only that he was older than her and walked with a cane. we stopped, and my mom asked them where they were going and if they wanted a ride. they said they were waiting for a bus to take them downtown and that they weren't sure how to get there.   i remember asking why their own sons and daughters weren't bothered enough to take their own parents to the place they needed to go? i wanted to know who in the right mind lets someone in failing health take a bus downtown. malaysian busses are notorious for being cruel and harsh, i wondered why they didn't have anyone help them at all. the weather was hot that day, they could have passed out from a heat stroke, they could have gotten hit by a car, he could have fell, she could have had a heart attack.   as we finally convinced them to get into the car, the man's eyes glistened with tears and said that he'd never sat in such an expensive car. and they thanked us profusely....again and again.   we move up the hierachy, we drive fancy cars and dine at exquisite restaurants..but we forget about the other people. the other people that aren't quite blessed, the other people that have to think twice about buying a sandwich, the other people with kids that have shoes that are too tight.   did we forget along the way?  did we just get so jaded and cold?  my mom still stops and picks people up from time to time. she picks up kids from the neighboring school that are walking home, she picks up this old lady that walks to the market every morning and strokes my mothers face and goes sayang, sayang. my mother is an amazing woman. she lives in the corporate world and jets off to different places, but i am so proud of her. i am proud of her and my dad because i know they are good people inside.  things are changing though, there is so much violence and cruelty in this world. sometimes i worry that she might pick up the wrong person, because the world is just fucked up like that.   i hope that i teach the kids to be selfless, and patient. i hope that i am a good example to them. i hope that they understand the difference between right and wrong, i hope that they know how much potential they have in them and how far they can go in life.   i'm starting to ramble, i started this post off with a range of emotions and now i am just tired. i hope that as you read this, you realize that you can make a difference. that you are special in your own right and you have a gift of your own to give to the world.  don't ever let go of your principles and morals. don't ever let go of life.      urlLink  "But I know how I feel today. Since 9am, Tuesday morning, I've been at home, on my couch, hugging my boyfriend. My friends are alive and my loved ones are safe.  Today, I am extremely thankful that I have no stories to tell."

      so i am on the campus walking in between classes when this "gangsta" (you know exactly who i'm talking about...the white scrawny guys with gold earrings and fubu sweatshirts and pants about halfway down) comes up to me to ask if i have a joint. "joint as in ciggarette? or joint as in  joint ?" i ask...and he replies, "the good shit man," okay "dude", who the fuck are you and why the fuck do you smell like ass? so i somewhat smile in labored breathing because the less i inhale, the better, and say sorry trying my best to get the fuck away from there. what does the bastard do? follows me to class. five blocks away. asks stupid questions like where do i work out and what's my freaking sign. i didn't think anyone in the world actually said that?!?!? and no, he isn't talking to me, he's tlaking to my boobs. and god almighty, get a hint! oh, and i don't like to be called baby doll either. so wrong.   there is a select group of strange people in pensacola, and somehow, i seem to meet them all.  can someone please kindly remove the sticker on my forehead that says "come hit on me if you're strange and smell funky"?    urlLink  "Q-tips make me happy. I freakin' love Q-tips. I love the way they feel as I roll them around in my ear, cleasing it of all that is waxy.  And don't even get me started about the joy they bring me when I twist them around in my belly button.  Oh, if only they made vibrating Q-tips..."

      my boyfriend tells me i am sensitive, sometimes in a cute pathetic kinda of way and sometimes in a self-destructive hurt myself because others are hurting kinda way.   somewhere deep in me, i want to save the world. i want to bring peace and humanity and justice. i want to feed the starving children in africa with my hands, i want to join the peace cor, i want to take in every stray cat and dog, i want to open up my home to every child, every stranger, every person that just needs one. i want to love someone, give out hugs and kissies and make the booboos go away.  but sometimes, wanting is all that i seem to achieve. wanting isn't quite the same as doing. procrastinating, and all that other crappy stuff gets in the way. and sometimes i sit alone and blame myself, blame the world, blame god.   it hasn't been a good year for most at all...sometimes the events that seem so integral to life just bogs you down, fucks you up along the way. i've never been good at dealing with death, as much peace as that would bring someone, as much as i know that that someone is in a place where the sun always shines and pain isn't even a feeling considered, i still cry.   so this is for baby muhammad, and rick.  this is for akari and grandma and brian.   this is for mun joon and all my other angels in the peadatric ward.   this is for yule and to the fragile existence of life.  i hung out with the kids today and it was beautiful. innocence and wonder, amazement and adoration. i loved every second of it. the way babies smell or the incomprehensible language that toddlers talk, the way i have stains on my pants from spitups and playing with the kids out in the yard. the way justin giggles and giggles and giggles. my happy child that one. or alex's fascination with strings....but the most amazing thing is loving them, teaching, nuturing caring. the way that they look up to you, the way that you look up to them too. the way that life is so magical and strange at the same time. the way babies grow into toddlers into preschoolers into children into teenagers into adults into mothers and fathers and into grandparents. the way that no matter who they are or what they become, that they will always be the children that i picked up after a nap, burped after a feeding, kissed their booboos and played the tickle tree with. the kids i read to on a rainy day and the babies i rocked to sleep. the little boys and girls that i worried my heart out as they trampled around the playground unaware of just how high or how dangerous it could be. the angels i cared for in a converted basement that was our sanctuary, the children i laughed, played, cried, and giggled with.   death is a strange painful thing. there's a curiousity that attaches to it but shatters you at the same time.   there must be a heaven, and in that heaven the kids are there playing, laughing, smiling. no more booboos. and in that heaven, there is also my grandma teaching uncle yule how to make sponge cake, while rick and brian are busy poking fun at the blogging world. yes, there is a heaven.  and maybe i'll see them all again there someday.   hugs.   urlLink   "We've all come a long way, and life did get very complicated. We all have something, but not everything. We've had love, and saw love lost. We've had our dreams fulfilled to the ends of the earth, but only after we've had it snatched from us over and over again. We were given joy, but in unexpected ways. We are offered happiness over the horizon, but on the condition that we let go of the comfort of our shores.  A lot of things happened to us in the last 6 years. But someone once told me, God never burdens us with more than He knows we can bear. "

      i've turned the house topsy-turvy looking for my camera charger and i still have no bloody idea where it is. something tells me that there is a possibility that it might be making it's way to jersey right now, ahh, yes...and if it is, i know just exactly where it is. the rubbermaid container filled with electronics that i helped ryan packed this morning...and if so, fuck me.   it's 2:56 am, still monday night for me, and normally, this is where i come home smelling of stale ciggarettes and a mish-mash of colognes because gay men just cna't live without it. chick from emerald city offered to come over and sleep with me tonight, an innocent suggestion because she knew i'd be lonely though when the cat is away the mice will play. i graciously declined, saying i wasn't up for it and told stories up my ass.   i miss drag night down at the club...i talked to sexy pants the other day, and he was moaning and groaning saying that i didn't care anymore. i've come to realize that as you get comfortable with someone, you sorta lose sights on everything else. the last couple of months have seen my friends coming over, or doing lunch and i've seemed to hung up my stilleto shoes and traded them for oven mitts. the house is impeccable though, and i am proud of what we have built so far together.   the dog and cat have been allowed back into  our  my bedroom, somehow, there's just so much space to still fill up.  i watched him pull away this afternoon, there was about an hour of silence right before he left of us just sitting together and lying in bed. he massaged my back and i breathed deeply that faint scent of his soap and closed my eyes. wondering. thinking. hoping.   i didn't start crying till he left, i know he needed to know that i would be okay on my own....and so as he left, i crawled back under the covers and stayed there a while. zigi by my feet and sasquatch on my chest, i watched bubba gumbo swim around in his tank for what seemed like forever till i finally cried myself to sleep. i am absolutely horrible with goodbyes.   my latest schedule is that i spend most of my evenings asleep and wake up at around ten at night and putz around, study, make some food, fuck around with the website, and then go to school. i think i'm going to go over to marc's tommorow and play with the kids. ten angels for comfort....yup, i think that would be just nice.   perfect if not.   how was your day?     urlLink  "I have come to the conclusion that, sometimes, rain can be the most beautiful thing."

who is going to pull the covers over me when i've mastered the art of kicking them off? who's going to turn off my light and put my book back on the table?   i don't think i remember how to make dinner for just one, or dinner that isn't too spicy or weird. i've mastered the art of fusion, of mixing asian and american spices into something decent.   the summer brings freedom, of doing what we feel like doing because we want to do it. of less laundry and dishes but more complication and so much loneliness.   i've been reading through the last couple of posts, of episodes and episodes of sinking into a dark place and how he's helped pulled me through all those times. he's delaying his departure tomorrow so he can go in with me to the doctor's to get my shots. i've left him to ask the questions, to grill the doctors, to say fucking fix her now you bloody idiots.   i'll miss you.  i'll miss knowing that you'll be home waiting for me when i go out. i'll miss telling you about my day and watching you do your silly dances. i'll miss your laughter, the way your whole face scrunches up or the way your beautiful gray eyes smile. i'll miss listening to you and stevie talk, when you're the cool older brother that's trying to be all stern and shit.i'll miss the way you're always out in the audience supporting me even if i don't see you, i'll miss knowing that you are just there. i'll miss coming home and finding little surprises along the way, i'll miss sitting by the beach and watching the sun go down with your arms around my waist and the waves washing onto the shore. i'll miss three am excursions to walmart for absolutely nothing and watching you at work. i'll miss fighting with you just to get my way, or poking fun at you. i'll miss tickling the bottom of your feet when you're asleep or wrestling in bed. i'll miss the way you know exactly what, exactly when...the way you kiss me when i don't expect it, the way you are okay with me being stupid or crazy or retarded or fucked up.   i know i want him in my life for ever and ever and ever.   i know i carry a piece of him everywhere that i go.  i know that i adore him possibly even much more than he does me.   i know what it means to be in love and to go through thick and thin...and then a little bit more.   it's four o five in the morning and he's fallen asleep on the couch in our living room because he's waiting for me to get done with my shit so we can go to bed. i love just sitting here and looking at him, wanting to soak it all in...of how happy love makes me feel inside, that even through everything, there are strong arms that carry me along the way.   i'm flying into jersey in about a month, we have a weekend away planned. in between the two summer terms of intense classes with notes flying out my ass..this is going to be another crazy summer. i fly back somewhere in august to malaysia, it's the first year i've missed the cheerleading finals and some nostalgic memory chokes me up. i am only scheduled for two weeks at home and that does not seem to be even nearly enough. there's so many things that i want to do, people and places.   i turn twenty this october, does it seem as weird to you that i've been here for twenty freaking goddamn years? sometimes, i feel like i haven't accomplished enough, yet there are moments where i know that i've come a long long way from where i couldn't possibly imagine i would end.  so here's to summer and life, for all the quirks it sends along the way and all the brickbats we somehow stumble through.   ((hugs))     urlLink  "And we toasted our clever selves, and drank. To those who stick by us. To those who love us when we're ugly. To those who forget our birthdays but remember to put out the bedside light. To those who don't call us in the middle of the work-day but never fail to ensure the chauffeur is at our door steps when we want him to be. To those who always show our parents respect. To those who hardly say "I love you" but cannot imagine life without us.   To those who drag themselves to work every day just so we can sit at home and drink the nectars of their success.  And it tasted just as sweet as it smelled."

      something stops and clicks, something in the air that on intake, seems deathly still and suffocating. perhaps it is only in my mind, perhaps i am caging myself in a prison cell and erecting barriers where they don't belong. but then again, perhaps i am only protecting.  survival of the fittest.

      everything fades into a blur of dissonance and heart ache, joy, sorrow, pain, elation. there is a break between reality and fantasy, of falling through the cracks of life and hope that loosely, tightly, binds it together.   the anticipation of something worth waiting for, worth fighting for with bleeding palms and scraped knees. the summer approaches like the boogieman and the monsters under your bed. he leaves in two weeks, ten days to be exact and the picture memories are in full drive.  snap. snap.   this and that and this and that, intricate moments held on so tightly, memories ziplocked, double-padded and stored away with special care.  the house is getting emptier as summer rolls around, the walls begin to echo and the flies begin to weave their stories. people are coming and going....going most of all and the roller-coaster ride of inferno begins. a double full load with a day to spare in between, 15000 miles to fly, three coasts, two major seas.   results of sorts arrive on monday, anticipation. anticipation. anticipation.   breathe.

      life is a little crazy at the moment. i don't know if i should tell you about the perfect shrimp scampi-alfredo linguine jessica and i concocted tonight or about my nightmare down at the memphis airport.   or then again, maybe i could tell you about how i'm going to take three express classes for this part of the summer which would make my ass in school at eight and home at ten at night. stupid idiot racheal.  or then, maybe i should tell you about the incredulous amount that the bookstore charges for textbooks nowadays and how if you click over to half.com, it's 1/3 the price, and then you shove it back their(bookstore) asses and sell it back to them(buyback) at the end of the term for three times the price. ahhh...invesment.   or maybe i will tell you about how much i miss ryan and how much more i realize and feel that now that i've had a taste of him. it's like luring a bullimic with a teaspoon of fudge. pure evil.   oh, and did i tell you that the dynamitez placed second in the nationals?   :)  or that kim had baby catalina last night after a good 21 hours of labor?   and in her words i say, "it was all soooo worth it!!"  there's also the five books a week plan that i'm following religiously in an effort to uhm, improve myself. to put it quite crazily, i've literally got a suitcase of books that i am determined to finish by the summer.   at the beach of course.   i'll be the one in betty boop sunglasses and anime on my bikini with a blue/yellow plastic explosive-looking thing that sticks out somewhere in between the rolls of my belly fat.  so maybe i'll end things and sort of summarize it with a little happy dance and good cry that things are going pretty okay for the most part, and yet they could be much worst(better).   depending on your perspective.   gimme a quick hug and do the chicken dance with me because i have to pee.

      i watched as he pulled away from the terminal, 5:40am, a weekend spent in glorious coupling, sharing, conversations....so many things to remember...the flight from hell that took two days, his friends, the boardwalk...his little place away from home.   i missed this, missed you.   it's funny how big of chunk is missing from my life.   the first few hours together like a reverie, deja vu. what, where, who?  and if i could, i'd turn around and get on the next flight.   say fuck school and responsibilities.  fuck everything else.  because three days was too short when you want to spend forever with someone.   laughing. i miss laughing with you.  or watching a good movie together.  this place smells the same, a reminder. i feel so odd(off) without you.  i hate this summer away bullshit.   the house feels so empty, and menacing, in some way, without you.   back to dinner for one and a bed to myself alone.   back to life, and going ons, and day to day to day.  monotonous.   funny how a flight from newark to pensacola can take forever.   funny how it breaks my heart to leave but even more so to go.  funny how i love you so much, in spoken and unspoken, in cups of coffee and spoonfulls of sugar...in sunsets at the back of the pier, in crazy nauseating rides we take together.  i miss you.

      our computer room is fucked to hell. it's a sweltering 84 degrees and the little tiny bity fan does not do justice. something tells me that if the landlord doesn't get his butt in gear, the racheal-jessica wrath is going to come out.  let's just say that the ducts were supposed to be installed last october.   uhuh.  ---  i just got of the phone with chinesewhiteboy. chinesewhiteboy is so adorable. :) i haven't talked to him in a good couple of months, and i was talking to his partner and apparently, their  urlLink fancy-smanzy company  features a US number that you can call and it's patched to hong kong and wales and all the different ports that the rest of the board is at. kinda like calling aol customer service and getting routed to india. very cool.  free for you and cheap for them!  he's talking about backpacking in europe and stopping over in switzerland at his parent's chalet and what a pain it is to come back to work....as i am sitting here with my ass up with finals and assignments and a shitload of studying. the fantastic news though is that in two days, my ass is going to be on a plane to new jersey. yay me! and in a month and a half, that same ass is going to be in amsterdam and then malaysia. sweet me.   we're talking about friends and high-school and that certain nostalgia that comes with growing older and the crisis of wallowing away from your teenage years. it's so weird to sit here and watch as the girls from our cheerleading team have grown up into adults, even stranger to watch them blossom into young women. i am so proud of all that they have achieved. this is the first year that i can't make it to the cheerleading finals and that shit just breaks my heart. it's crazy how far they've come and nice to think that i was a part of it for a while.  ---  ryan and i are going to phoenix in november. i called in and booked our tickets today. :)  i don't know if it's going to be good or horrible or fantastic but we'll see.  think all my family members at the same place and the grilling!!!  mervin and koren are finally getting married(about damn time!) and that just makes me so happy! after ku-chang and grandma and all, it's nice to have a good reason for the family to get together.   bryan and yee mei are coming in from singapore, davinia and significant other from australia, apak from taiwan, apakleung from shanghai, my parents from malaysia, and some friends of theirs from tokyo and then there are the ones from this side of the continent. it's going to be interesting...it'll be the first time my extended family meets ryan and i am excited, proud and scared out of my mind!  i was talking to my aunt today(kumah) and she's like bring ryan! bring ryan! we have to meet ryan! bring ryan!   lol.  :)  we're going to miss out on the singapore wedding though, because negotiating to go across the country was a dillema in itself, i don't think we're even going to attempt the crossing the seas.  think of it this way, some day, that's going to be us.  only it'd be missouri and malaysia.  and he isn't german-american-japanese.  crazyness.   woohoo!  (i'm so excited!!)  p/s were the pictured of the kids yesterday just not absolutely fucking adorable?!?!?   :)    urlLink  "Today is good. "

      she strips off layer by layer, taking the glitter off, toning the make-up down. a little less out there, but still edgy. a little less anxious and crazy, but still kooky.   reflecting through almost eighteen months of pleasure(torture), delight(sadness), love(hate)...they're moving into a new city. her lover boy and her, building more castles and painting more vibrant colors in what was once her comfortable black, white and grey existence(pain).  she reads through all the things on paper that are said about her. and someone reflects that that seems like a different person. the cheerleader, the roller blader, the orang asli bitch, the school school school happy....only she doesn't think so, not anymore. i'm still me, she whispers. just me.   and as she's gathering the testimonials and references, she realizes just how much love is around her. the praising joy of her teachers, the pride and confidence of her admissions officer, the people around her that pick her up and push her forward. hardly, gently, softly, subtlely.   --  sometimes, i'd like to hide away from the world a while. just nestled between the cracks of a rock and a hard place...or something along those lines anyway. it's when you're crying, and you don't know why. is when you miss someone, and loneliness creeps behind you and goes boo. in a big terrifying way. a way that catches you when you aren't expecting, a way that says watch out, keep tight, fuck you.   empty bed. empty big bed with many pillows and rainbow stripes. washing  our  sheets, sooner rather than later, i can't smell his smell that comforts me, only of purex and downy, only of freshly laundered sheets and nothing else.   three days, three days.   ---  be quiet.   the boogiemen are watching.

      this week has been crazy to say the least....in between trying to adjust again to tiny pensacola after five days of absolute bliss in chicago, i am leaving again this thursday to go to new jersey.   to see the other half.   to have wild fantastic unbelievable sex.   to try out the new ky warming liquid.   to fuck my boyfriends brains out.   :) :) :)  anyway, before pleasure comes a shitload of torture! it's the last week of this term and so finals are biting me in the ass with all sorts of ridiculous 1500-word essays that talk about stupid things like literature and nutrition and fitness and hemmingway. pah...hemmingway shemingway. then there are the final exams to cram for, and yes, cram, because you know how brilliant my study habits are. :P  then there is the insane madness that generally goes around in my life because i think above the sticker on my head that says 'assholes and weirdos hit on me!' there is this other one that says 'chaos, panic and disorder HERE! HERE! HERE!'. but ahh, the bliss of being neurotic and crazy. oh. so. fun.   i spent the whole of yesterday working on revamping the childcare for summer fun!! lol, we went shoppiong for buckets and shovels and sandcastles. fishes, inner tubes of every adorable kind, snacks, crazy curtains, ice-cream, popsicles, shrek yogurt! oh god, the things i would give to be a child again... theresa(the childcare owner fantastic lady person) decorates the childcare specifically to every season and just the amount of dedication she puts into it is a wonder of itself. then we painted the kids curiculum(sp?) room....lol, it's now two sides of yellow and two sides of ocean green. now someone told me that yellow will make the kids hyper...OH SHIT.  there's also the current issue of the laundry. FUCKING HELL. i did two loads of laundry the last time i blogged and there are two new loads fuckinh with my head. argghhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!! i. hate. ironing. sticking it in the washer and transferring it to the dryer is fine...but goddamnit, ironing is such a suck ass bastardy creation. you, person that scrunches up your nose at my wrinkled clothes, kiss my yellow ass big behind.   fifteen more hours of the weekend..  hm..  wonder what sort of shit the boys and i can get into tonight?  :P      urlLink  "I just want to bang on the drum"

       " broken bones and promises.   you didn't have to tell me who you are, i knew right away. why are you calling me? you tell me you read about my dad. you told me you were sorry. you wanted me to talk. i admit that i blew you off. what else am i supposed to do? am i supposed to play nice and talk about my feelings? do you really want to hear about how i'm feeling? then we can be nice and civil with each other for a few weeks (days?) before one of us is screaming at the other for something or another. no thanks. i think i finally learned my lesson the last time. i could have skipped all the nice bullshit and gone straight into yelling, but really nobody needs that shit either. so i just blew you off. i'm an asshole. whatever.  what else am i supposed to do? i can't decide whether i love you or hate you...and some days i'm not so sure that it's not one in the same. it's a comforting thought to think that i have a place to run...i just wish it wasn't you. i am nothing you need to be worrying about anymore. i am not your problem. you made your choice and i made mine."     sorry. i don't know. whatever.

      jared's dad isn't doing too well.  i read, and i guess a part of me hurts for him...the things he must be going through. and i'm sitting here wondering if i should call, or send him an email or if it would be better off if i just didn't say anything at all. what is the protocol in things like this? and if there is, i think we've hardly been conventional in the first place.   we're on different roads, and we have broken promises. i've always tried to keep some sort of friendship going i think, no matter how twisted or fucked up, because in some realm, i think we owe both of us that. love didn't work out in a way that it was supposed to, but what puts a restriction on friendship other than us?  i don't want to start the ball rolling on another tumultous journey to hell where we scream and shout and cry, neither do i want to leave him with more grief than he must already be going through. but then again, i cannot but sit here and just do nothing. it's like watching someone drown and just looking. bad metaphor, but you know what i mean.   i've just spend the last five days in chicago with my parents. and everyone knows that i am daddy's little girl. this hits so close to home because this weekend, i also realized that my parents are fifty one and growing older. that they get tired easier and that someday, they might get too weak to fly. that's a dramatic take on things i know, but it's like you suddenly realize how fucking precious life is.   my parents have been so amazing. i was a child again, and i got hugs and kisses and was pampered and it was just so nice. albiet it was a whim to just decide that i was going to go and book my tickets and just go. it was nice to do that though, nice to have that option. i was worried my dad would balk because it was extra charges on the credit card but instead they were so nice about it. they paid for everything and my mom cried when my dad told her i was going to meet them in chicago! when i met her at the hotel, she gave me one of the biggest hugs ever, and i remember what it felt like to have your mom and dad by your side all the time. the security, the comfort, the warmth. she told the driver that was taking me to the airport today to take care of her 'precious cargo'. and my dad just about made everything perfect for me, eating at restraunts i liked, going places, humoring me and walking all over town taking 'artsy' pictures with my brand new canon ixus camera they brought for me(!) but one of the most important gestures to me was that he brought me and ryan his and hers matching watches. it's this funky little metal thing with the numbers all groovy and black leather straps which is the kinda of thing we would like cause we're all weird like that but what touched me was that the gift wasn't just about me. it was about us. it was like acceptance to me, and if you know my dad, he's the gentlelest sweetest person on earth but if you hurt his daughter he'll fucking break your back and kill you. a little overprotective might be an understatement. and so that gesture filled me up with so much joy and warmth, that my dad said to my mom to get us the watches and brought it all the way from malaysia. and just for laughs, he also brought us caps that said "you know you're a redneck if..."  :)  we stayed an absolutely beautiful boutique hotel. a little pricey and crazy happy with their charges but it was decorated in this artsy fartsy style it was so cute. when you call the front desk they answer with your name, with housekeeping and room service and all the extra little things that make a holiday  a holiday.  hotel 71 people, damn nice hotel minus the stuffy european la di da stuff you normally get at hotels like that.      i miss my parents already, but it was so so so nice to spend the weekend with them.   old man told me to shut up when he picked me up from the airport because i must have gone on and on and on and on about it for the whole drive back.   i don't know, it's a little bitter sweet i suppose. like there's a strange aftertaste to having a fantastic weekend then realizing things.   one of the things my mom brought me was my grandmother's diamond ring that she always wore and i inherited. i might have shed a tear or two when i saw it because i don't think i ever saw grandma without it and it was special. i don't know. i'm being sappy.   umpacking calls and my cat, dog and fish are begging to be pampered.  love you guys, stay safe.     urlLink  "i wish...i wish that things would pick up for me. don't i deserve good things too?"    in more ways than a million.

      idle chatter in a white room with empty spaces, no color(distinction), me and you, flesh on flesh..exploring.   he reminds me what i am made of...on days where the world seems to be fucking me over and shoving a knife up my ass. on days where i get jipped by our landscaping company and yelled at by a homeless girl because i gave her a five instead of a ten. on a day where doubt lingers like a bitter aftertaste and the surreality of growing up becomes too real.   it seems that as the teenage years flash before your eyes and the impending stage of being a grown up comes, that the question "who am i?" haunts you like irritating burs on your puppy that take forever to pluck out. like a splinter deep enough to irritate but not deep enough to draw blood and definitely not shallow enough to pinch out. like why are red sunsets so beautiful when it signifies the polluted air?  there are so many silly inconsequential things you learn in an earth science class. like did you know that the water in your toilet bowl spirals counter clockwise in the southern hemisphere and clockwise in the northern hemisphere? or that the reason why red soil is abundant in florida and malaysia is because of the humidity that makes the iron minerals in it oxidate?   there are some days, where i curse my voice because it borders between a man and an old woman. like somewhere in my past life i was a baritone but when i came into this dimension, they forgot to alter that fact.   i hate how in musicals, all the leading roles are always for sopranos. it's like a big fuck you sometimes. discouraging to say the least.   but yet i am gifted in an alto voice. a rich sexy sultry tone that comes out from somewhere deep within me. strange.   why am i so shy?  ryan bitches at me day after day that i am too hard on myself.   and maybe i am. but sometimes, i find that being able to say that i am something, beautiful, intelligent, amazing, fantastic, seems so rude. it makes me want to hide in a corner and pull the covers over my head.   there is a disposition that seems to scream out to others. this front that i have that i am loud, and outspoken, and confident. oh god, if you only knew the things that went in my head. that i am good with boys, flirtatious....if you only knew that when someone chats me up i look for the closest exit. perhaps it is the pathetic clutch on a facade that makes me good at what i do on stage. the ability to take on another persona, the ability to slip into the mind of someone else. i don't know.   i blush inside, where no one else sees. and in that special place hides all my fears and wants, hopes and needs. striving to be a somebody in a world that sometimes wants you just to conform to a nobody. there are certain things i always stand up for, children, abuse, cancer, justice...but with that, there are many others that i would like to stand up for but don't. me.   my mom and dad tell me i am horrible at saying no. which is an understatement to those that know me well and absurd to the others that think they know me but don't. here i am, this gregarious crazy in your face girl that seems to be loud and friendly and all those things at once, but the ones that live with me, the ones that have tapped through the layers know that inside, i am scared, and shy. negative, and agoraphobic, mad and dellusional.   as i am peeling through the layers and finding myself, i realize that there is a comfort zone...a nice thin line that i thread on, if i let myself. a chance for freedom and still, hapless self examination.   what was my point in this whole ramble again? i'm not quite sure.   i think the heat is getting to me.   hugs  :P

          &nbsp;  lol, contrary to what i told daisy the other day, most of the time, while i mantain that i really am the boss, the little guy really keeps me in check.   :)   this picture makes me grin.   heh.   i picked up that shirt for&nbsp;wee wayne&nbsp;while i was in jersey and it says,   "i'm boss. no questions. no buts. we just do things my way"   or something in the lines of that anyway.   :P   &nbsp;  p/s doesn't the angle of the picture make it look like the little rascal took the picture on his own?   and what is that cheeky little smirk trying to say?   *miss racheal, you are so stupid.*   &nbsp;     urlLink "and I am actually enjoying it. For all the I-want-to-strangle-you-and-rip-your-heart-out moments... there have been many more "awww" and laugh-out-loud-til-your-tummy-hurts moments to compensate. Like when I told Oskie, "now, don't pee-pee in the pool okay... it's not nice." And he answers with a deadpan face... "But Daisy... I like it!". "

      it's that one day where your "you know you're a red neck if..." hat is worn backwards along with your 9.99 Gap baggy jeans found in the men's section&nbsp;for that "gangsta" look with a shirt with stripes going the wrong way that fit snuggly around your waist and a neckline that make your boobies say peekaboo!   it's when you have that&nbsp; precious lunch break between classes and with backpack in hand, you run to the mall for some shopping theraphy and to meet a friend of&nbsp; a friend of a friend that owes you fifty bucks.   and it's in those 45 minutes that you run into the ???. (can you really call that&nbsp;one&nbsp;night stand anything?)  you glance over and you go, oh shit.   then you casually saunter by trying to pretend that you didn't see him. or that he doesn't recognize you. or oh god, you're just embarassed.   but of course he walks over to you and kisses the air around your cheeks and you go...HEY!!, as if you were just about to do the same thing.  and you suck in your gut hoping the layers of fat around your tummy will somehow dissappear.   you stand a little taller in your cute ass pink shoes and smile. a lot. okay, maybe a little too much.  he makes small talk and so do you, about life&nbsp;and the "good ole days" whatever the hell that means?   hm.  and then you say you really really have to go.  and walk away with your cheeks flushed and your brain blaring sirens.   and late at night, after a whole day of classes, as you're emptying out your pockets to take a shower you realize that he's slipped his card&nbsp;into your side pocket, that you couldn't feel because those pants could have fit two of you, for a booty call.  damn fucker.  &nbsp;

      life is a cacophony of accidents and reality biting you in the ass. instances where everything flows together smoothly and harmony is achieved by merely breathing. trudging on, waddling through the mud and debris, feeling the sediments wash through your fingers. watching the lightning and the thunder engulf you and roll pass by. &nbsp; it's a melancholic tuesday for me. something about the air that reeks of reflections and permeates of the future. &nbsp; conversations that have reminded me of a being, a girl, a person i once knew. relationships past and somehow forgotten, memories that seem sketchy and not quite there. dreams and nightmares that haunt and enlighten. connections with people on the other side of the world....remembering them as they were. cheerful, happy, sometimes dying in your arms, sometimes there but not really there...alive but knowing they are dead. what happens when you close your eyes late at night and journey on into dream(nightmare)land? &nbsp; is grandma really gone? i catch myself sometimes unconsciously picking up the phone to dial grandma and see how she is doing. or i wake up from a dream that seems so real it is a nightmare. where i am holding her and she is taking her last breath, or we are joking about something, and there are all these words and conversations that seem like a blur once you wake up, you don't remember what it was all about, but you know that in those precious hours that you call sleep, she was so alive.  &nbsp; i think some part of me aches because there is no closure. because the last time i ever saw her was behind glass doors fighting for her life and the feeling that i was abandoning her. &nbsp; some things are so strange on tuesday mornings when it isn't quite monday anymore and definitely isn't wednesday yet.  &nbsp; when your schedule seems to relax a little in between classes and general madness.  &nbsp; when you're done with laundry and housecleaning and grocery shopping.  &nbsp; went to panama city for the weekend and it was beautiful. a chance to relax and catch up with life. nature. beauty.  &nbsp; the distant ticking of swinging golfclubs meeting golf balls. the splashes of happy children in a swimming pool. the busy busy busy disconcorted harmony of tourists bustling. things. moments. instances.  &nbsp; life is so strange and beautiful and exquisite and depressing and joyous and incomprehensible and overwhelming.  &nbsp; hugs. &nbsp; :) &nbsp;

      i meant to write this down the other day. and i think i started with three paragraphs of incoherent rambling. somehow, at half past two in the morning, it starts to make sense. somewhat. racheal sense anyway.  i hate how my country defines  melayu ,  cina ,  india , and my personal favorite,  dan lain-lain . a distinction between color, and race. a distinction between who you are, which family you were born into, what shades of brown and yellow and black you are. i wish we were all green, or maybe purple. i wish jealousy was a folklore, something my great-grandparents told us about with anecdotes and morals heavily threaded somewhere into it. i wish jealousy did not exist.   but yet, my country, lives in h a r m o n y. harmony is such a nice word isn't it? the mak cik three doors down and the ah-sam next to me with the aunty two doors over.   but here in america, the land of the free.....there is still a classic distinction between the black and white neighborhood. and then the "lain-lain" come to play to. those that don't quite fit in(foreigners) lumped together into a community of sorts. Community.   and in america, and malaysia; there is still seperation. seperation among races, seperation inside races. white and black. white thrash and elite. who the fuck came out with lower class, lower middle class, upper middle class, and high class anyway?  what exactly is freedom to me?  i have never considered myself, third world and all, to be oppressed. or to not know the meaning of freedom. yet culture shock can do strange things to your system sometimes.  was i brain-washed?   or do i willingly agree to the concepts that i have been taught since young?  things like you just don't say shit about your government.  things like internal security acts and being politically right.  things like whatever they tell you, you just stick your tail between your legs and listen.  and sometimes it makes me mad.  there are days, where i know i don't stand up enough for what is right because in school and in our culture, and in the way we were raised...you took the shit as it came.   and there are days, that i am so angry with myself because i am bleeding and dying and crying and suffocating, but yet the pressure continues to boil over because i don't know how to verbalize. or fight. or go against the "right".  there are times where i am upset with the government and their stupid policies and the silly political crap they play with one another. but can you really say anything against the prime minister? or barisan national? or...islam?  but yet i know i've never quite walked the straight line. i've always strayed a little, shocked others. wore tube tops and shown my belly ring. altered my uniforms and said what was on my mind. asked questions in class and challenged a concept.   taken control of my life.   when i came to america, it was strange and exciting and so fucking terrifying at the same time. why does the old man openly state his opinion on what he thinks about the bush administration? people go to jail for that in my country.   or in my first semester, when i was still a journalism student, how i didn't want to write that paper at all discriminating my college in a national paper i was assigned to write. how i argued for hours and hours. how i wouldn't do it, couldn't do it. dreams shattered the moment you realize you can't quite get past the fear. because no matter how "politically incorrect" i am inside and around my circle, i can't slander. i can't say bad things, even if they are true.   but then again, malaysia has taught me so many things that america probably never will.  respecting one another's religion. that religion is not a bearer.  learning three languages.  and definitely celebrating about five different ethnic festivities. so what if i'm not indian? or malay? or kadazan? kongi raya. i like that word.   the meaning of "respect". something that pains me in the western civilized world because three year olds cuss at their mothers and kids call their parents by name and who the fuck is your neighbor anyway?  patriotism. red white and blue. my second home. fireworks and barbeques and celebrating the right to be treated equally, to have all the constitutions, to say what i want, whenever i want. to still feel a surge of pride when someone waves a malaysian flag, to put my hand across my heart after a salam, to sing god bless america the same way too. to be half of something and half of something else too.   being raised in america, as stupidly drunk as i get, drinking isn't the issue. i've lost more friends here to drunk driving than i have in malaysia because it isn't the "it" thing. it isn't a rite of passage. it just is.   where does my loyalty lie?  who am i?  half american? half malaysian? rojak?  what am i?  there are goods, and there are bads.   a long time ago, someone special and wise wrote this.  you got to take the good, the bad, the evil and the happy....and in it, you will find peace.    happy (belated) independence day and happy (beearly) merdeka.   go live out freedom today.  hugs.       urlLink  "Desiderata  Go placidly amid the noise and haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible, without surrender, be on good terms with all persons. Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even to the dull and ignorant; they too have their story. Avoid loud and aggressive persons; they are vexations to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain or bitter, for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself. Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your own career, however humble, it's a real possession in the changing fortunes of time. Exercise caution in your business affairs, for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals, and everywhere life is full of heroism. Be yourself. Especially do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantement, it is as perrenial as the grass. Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive him to be. And whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful. Strive to be happy.   Max Ehrmann (1872-1945)"

         i had a long conversation with an old friend last night. eighty two minutes and nineteen seconds exactly. i know this because my silly purple phone that lights up into a rainbow of colors tells me this everytime i hang up the phone. i think we started at around one or so, a nice surprise on a day that seemed good, on a day that even alone at home, with the cat and dog, with the thunderstorms and lightning creating art outside on our porch...things seemed alright. peaceful i suppose.  caller id read private. but then again, all my calls seem to be from private numbers these days. there's something about hiding beneath the shadow of uncertainty, or at least lurking in the dark. i don't know what it is, i always say it's because stupid navy boys get my number and ask for sex in the middle of the night.   it wasn't like the usual...not the tranquil setting of a certain coffee joint that i like, the whitewash of muted conversation in the background and perhaps krall washing ashore with her rhythms. nor were there other people to divert our conversation to and create meaningless gossip when things got a little too heavy.   it was me. getting tangled up in another book, watching my candles slowly burn away (this candle shit is a fucking expensive hobby), fingers sometimes reaching for that sacred area between my thighs and my evil cat and dog alone with me in my much too big bed, each begging for attention in their own way. listening to the night sounds, falling asleep, waiting for my "boo". :P  it was strange and exciting and melancholic all at once. it was like talking to a stranger yet talking to your best friend all at once. it was a conversation that picked up from where we put it down the last time. as if nothing at changed. as if we were both still kids with raging hormones in kuala lumpur figuring out our lives. i like how certain people can make me feel so comfortable with myself, and even more, i like how comfortable it feels to just be me. to not have facades and faces masking the demons deep within. i like listening.   to stories of japan and how life is treating him. to his latest crazy encounters or the general perception of foreigners and us. foreign. about him and her and suburban city life as i told him about fourth of july and my special date with sexy pants at hemmingways. as we talked about my farewell party and the sorry state i was in at the end of the night and explicit details of the shit i somehow always manage to step both feet into while embroiling myself in much more. we talked about when we were young, and crazy. about late night stops at the mamak store and exchanging pirated vcds, he reminded me about our first kiss. the ackwardness of not knowing what went were and why our bodies were reacting in such a strange way. discovering our sexuality at fourteen for the first time together. in a dark cinema, tanjung golden village in one utama, i remember the exact seats we sat at, arriving for the movie just at it started and having front row seats, cranking our necks so far up it ached for the next week.   it's funny the things you remember late at night when you are prompted.   by the time we got off the phone it was late, and an international call that probably cost up his ass at that.   but it was good.  and it made me treasure all my memories of growing up, of finding the paths and digging through the past to get to where i am heading. of the security and somewhat calmness in my life that i've somehow stumbled into. it's strange how things work out in the end, right where you never expect them to. it's funny how that when you learn to love someone, you never forget nor regret, no matter how questionable.   i am glad i met you to get to where i was going.   as many others (have).   as many more (will).  every bitter tear will mean a whoop dee doo laugh down the road.   hugs.      urlLink  "So, yeah, basically what i'm trying to say is: here's some shitty poetry."

      dark skin on white, and white caressing folds of olive.   tanned, one brown, one with tints of reddish pink.  i think about those nights, constantly.  a bed and two lovers.   moaning.  becoming one.

      i tell this story repeatedly about twice a month because it makes me smile, and my heart does a little happy dance.  it's a story of selflessness; the act of giving and recieving.  a good reminder of money, it's value and siblings. family.  your blood   i don't know how i stumbled into this gem, i think it was one of those hot malaysian afternoons where you're stuck in a traffic jam for hours and hours and you've exhausted all conversations on the now, and the current boyfriend, and school, and well...you know that shit.  and somehow, my dad tells me about how his brother used to wait up for him in the canteen to share his coke with him. and if you know my dad and this particular brother(my dad's the baby of 2 brothers and 2 sisters), it is that they have three passions in common.  i. their love of coke.  ii. their love of video games and all things technological.  iii. their infinite source of lectures for their only daughters.  i could tell you so many stories of this uncle and my dad. a good digression i think.  i could tell you how davinia and i used to run up to the wrong daddies because they looked exactly alike. or if your back is turned, and you're not really paying attention, how they sound exactly alike, intonations at all the same places, talk subjects so similiar even hand gestures and to a certain point, personalities.   my spend thrift genes come from my dad i think, well, then again, could be my mom too. so he tells me this story about how he would use up all his allowance and his brother would know that and save half his coke for him.  i don't know about you, but when you're at that age, i don't exactly think that you would be thinking about anyone else but you.  and so it's a nice story that reminds me to love my brother because he's the only one i've got. or that he looks out for me when i'm not looking.  my mother conspiratiolly told me the other day about how she and my brother were talking and he said i was special and very gifted. of course, he probably wouldn't tell that to my face but i know he loves me, and cares for me, even if he gets on my nerves and is overprotective as shit.   so yeah, i was just sitting in class thinking about that and thought i'd blog it.  hugs for all.  :)

      ruhing, rushing, rushing!  flying through memphis into amsterdam and touching down in kuala lumpur.  something like 28 hours of travel, anticipation, excitement, insanity, anxiety.   worried about connections and people and stinky fat chatty men next to me.   i guess i'll see you in malaysia!  :)  hugs
