      well. guess wat.. went to san's place last nite... jus worried bout her, checking her out. drove all da way from PJ to cyber..&nbsp; missed a few turns, but it was alright. went there. .. met WUSSY... met him once.. bout 2yrs back, when i was still wif my ex.   anyway.. when i was ay cyber jaya, i was hoping to see alien.. but then again, was hoping that i wont. eventually, God answered my prayer.. jus as i left cyber jaya.. he called me whether i was still there or not.. he jus got back, n kept complaining bout my ashtray.. being not useful! ah.. fated not to meet each other...  ailen went n played war craft.. so.... i guess... he also didnt wanna see me. well.. wat can i say??? nothing.... life goes one. life is sad. life suck.. but.. i've got to be strong. besides.... not seeing him wont make me nervous! i do realise..wheneve ri know that alien might be around, my stomach starts to be funny.... feel like vomiting. i wonder why???  i dono how i feel for him anymore... .. probably... jus... NUMB.  REMOTE! ok, me n bro have been searching for our fan's remoe for like da whole damn day!! couldnt find it! dono where it was.... practically ransack da whole pplace! until today... finally, my bro msged me....&nbsp; he told me the bloody remote was inside the DOMINO's pizza box!! thank God for my bad habbits.... i didnt throw da box away!! hahahahha!!&nbsp;&nbsp; now... i have to pray that i can find my office's mailbox key!! if not.. im DOOMED!!!!!!!!!  anyway going home from work now.. its 8:25pm...&nbsp; Ciao..&nbsp; *hugs*

      my Gosh.. went out at 2pm.. to Setapak, coz i have to collect cheque for my boss.... can't beliv im doing all these crappy stuff! oh well.. training myself to be a very capable person! haha.. yea rite.  anyway, it was such a long long journey, cos i have no freaking idea how to go aorund setapak.. i decided to use the old way. LRT - CAB! safer! at least i know i wont get wrong..&nbsp; parked my car at the kelana jaya station.. took the lRT.. gosh, was soo tired that i slept in the train. Thank God my bro accompanied me, jus incase i missed the stop! the whole journey took bout 2 hours plus man!!!!!! went out at 2pm came back to my office at KJ at 5pm!!!!   while taking the LRT, lots of memories flashed back.. really miss those days, when i was still in Lim kok wing, studying.. sitting the lrt with my ex bf... the moments..&nbsp; it's been like wat.. 2 yrs? since i last sat LRT?   but i must say... its really tiring, especially when i have to STAND all the way from WANGSA MAJU to KELANA JAYA! thats like... 45 mins!!!!!&nbsp; hai... wat to do... im just an employee.... cant be the boss yet. even if im the boss, i think i would still have to do these kind of things. next time.. i'll make sure i have an office boy!!! that way... i can jus..... chill, and of coz.. do work!

      UNlucky in LUrve...  well, i guess i've always been unlucky in love, or so i consider myself lucky despite the fact that he treated me the best among all the chicks??  have u were thought that there would be 3 men in your life? one is the one u love most, the one who u would marry, and another one is the one who loves u.?? i've found the perosn i love most, not sure whether he is the person what loves me. but.. im sure i've not found the preson im gonna get married with!  luv sux... suprisingly.. every gal pal i have around me are attached!! i really dono wats my problem.. am i not over him yet? can't be. i don think bout him anymore.  jus finish chatting with my " used to be" gal pal.. not sure whether she is one now, coz altho ive forgiven her... im still mad at her, of wat she did to me. it hurts sooo soo much..anyway, i tried chatting with her decently, for crying out loud, she has been saying sorry to me from Day one!! i guess being nice is all i could do.. we did talk alot.. bout what happened. how could it happened, and it really ruined the frenship. i'll have to admit.. we r totally different.. diff life style. even tho ive once said mean things to her, ( heck i was really pissed at her man) but i guess.. when a person grows up... we tend to learn more things.. and little things like this doesnt matter  anymore. but then again.. its not easy...  guess i was really unlucky to be in love with my ex.. i dono. as much as i wan to forget him, get him out of my system.. its never easy.. and i know it will never be easy.   ive not spoken to him for so long.. and jus few days ago, i went online, he msged me, we chat abit... it was a normal chat, he actually said he misses chatting with me like this.. i guess deep down inside. i do miss him. jus tat i don wanna admit it. anyway.. ironically.. I DREAMT bout him that NIte!!! damn!!!!!!!!!  why cant i jus forget bout him???!?  shheeshh.. really is frustrating...  speaking of frustration.... i always end up liking guys who r already attached!!! are all good guys taken!?!?!?! man.. thats so unfair!!! i did like a guy back home..when i was on my holiday... but too bad he is taken. sad case...  :(  oh gawd...  life.. tats bout it man.  Cheers.!

Anyway, was back in KK, sabah last weekend!
