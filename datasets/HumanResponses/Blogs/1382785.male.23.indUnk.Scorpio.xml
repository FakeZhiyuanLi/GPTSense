      i find myself so busy lately and the crazy thing is i have no idea why.  work has been dead yet i am always on the go there never stopping it feels like, oh well what are ya going to do? it looks like spring has finally sprung, and it is about time, the sun and the temp really boosts my spirits plus with the extended hours of light its perfect, the leafs go again tonight should be a good one the first game was sweet. this weekend should be fun not too much planned hopefuly just relax maybe see a movie and go for dinner, and i really need to sleep in sometime too. i think i am getting obsesed with jeopardy i love it! i remember when i was in burlington watching it with my nanny, and now if it is on i watch it, i am getting pretty good, at least i think so, we got this timeshifting thing with your cable so now we can watch things again if we missed them survivor friends all that stuff but jeopardy too hehehe, small things amuse small minds :p

       urlLink i would assume that most of the people that are going to come here know me already, so i will not bore you with my life history (not that it is boring).  however a brief history is this...born in burlington, grew up there, met my wife (who is pure magic), moved to kitchener, bought a house.  oh and we have a cat. i'm into sports music computers and photography, i am not into spelling, grammar, punctuation (so forgive me). you will find links to things that interest and concern me here.  i am not promising the world however promising nothing :p hopefully as time goes on i will find out some more tricks and implement them here, until then cheers!

      well it has been a while and i am back, to be honest i havent really been on my computer in a while either, so dont think i am ignoring all you people out there...not much happening, work sucks and i want to change jobs but i dont know what to do, plus i have to wait for my house to close in september before i can even look, so i am kinda stuck here, as long as it pays the bills at the end of the month than i am okay.  cars suck too, my wipers arent working and i have to get them fixed for the second time, hopefully its not going to cost an arm and a leg...went out with some friends the other night and played some NTN trivia, that was tons of fun, felt good to be out and about, anyways i'll try to be more on top of this thing, until then cheers!

      the last week has been so nice, its about time though, the winter was so shity and i think everyone one has been awaiting the cold snap, it gets me thinking of all this stuff i want to do in our yard...only thing is the builders are yet to put down sod so we are screwed and cant really do a damn thing, although once it is done there will be a list a mile long of stuff that needs to be made...this is a pretty cool looking  urlLink fire pit  that may just make the list...

       urlLink News: Mexican Air Force Films UFOs  okay dont we all agree we are not the only things in this universe, so its nice to see that an agency is finally willing to admit it too, now you can say what you will about the evidence fake or not, but you have to give them props for sticking their necks out...

      well...here i am again, i have not been too faithfull with this thing over the past year, but a lot has changed in that year so i am going to give it another go.  you may notice i have changed the look around here, i think it looks better, a bit more upbeat, wouldnt you say. as i was mentioning a lot has changed in the past year, we moved into our house in october and i now have a new job, which means everyone is a lot happier and hey, isnt that what life is all about, well until next time...

       urlLink Awful Plastic Surgery  This is an interesting look at the celebrity world, some celebs you would never think that they have gotten work done yet others it seems really obvious exspecially with the before and after pictures, its kinda funny but a lot of times they looked better before...some are a real shock and you have to ask yourself what the hell were you thinking...as for me, dont worry no work done here, all natural baby...its all me...which some may say is good and others maybe say is bad...either way i am staying the same so blah...

       urlLink MSNBC - Sept. 11 panel moves on to NYC  hello again, i have been feeling under the weather lately but am doing a bit better today, just a messed up head cold i think...the weekend was good, i had to work on saturday for a bit but no big deal really, sunday was really good spent a lot of time outside in the sun, went mini-golfing and than went out for dinner with some friends...all in all a good weekend...now you might say i am not the biggest fan of the USA for a number of reasons and you can call me what you will but hell i'm still going to think what i want, but after reading this article from cnn, i was shocked, its hard to think that there is a group down there that is judging how well emergency crews reacted to two airliners slamming in to two buildings...now i'm sure there are measures and procedures that need to be taken and that are taught to firefighters and police people, but to say that they failed to do what was expected of them is crazy...i agree with Giuliani's..........yes it probably smart to have compatible radio systems but i dont think anyone could have been trained for that...anyways sorry i kinda went on there...just my 2 cents ya know.

       urlLink Venus' trip across the Sun draws thousands  this is pretty cool, i'm kinda into astronomy and stuff but not really, if you know what i mean.  i totally missed this though, and it was funny cause i was farting around on the net one day and read that this was going to be happening, so i made a little note on my calendar but than still totally forgot about it, i was at wonderland at the time it would have been happening and it was pretty overcast for the morning until about 2 so so i probably wouldnt have been able to see anything anyway...but yeah cool shit eh

       urlLink TheStar.com - No link between Saddam, 9/11  hmmmm....isnt that interesting i kinda thought it was amazing how 5 minutes after the WTC fell that the US was starting a war, now you may think that they must of had some reason to do this, right? and maybe they did someone must have told them that they were working together and that is fine that is that persons job to figure it all out, however if US was so sure on that intelligence than why did they not listen when that intelligence told them the attack was coming?? SCREWED! now i am no one of mass importance and nor am i anyone that has all the facts but shit!

       urlLink CNN.com - Rapper DMX arrested in New York - Jun 25, 2004  if i were a somewhat popular rapper than from time to time came out with catchy song that stuck around for a couple months, i think i would be making enough  money to buy my own car.  i really dont get celbrities and what the hell they are thinking sometimes, you always hear about big timers that get paid millions and they go bankrupt that they are having money troubles its prob because of all the shit they buy...i would definetly buy some cool shit but than stop, you wont me famous for ever so you wont be rich forever either...one thing that i am not sure about is celebs winning shit...i kinda think they should be not allowed to.  dont know if you heard but aflack just won like $350,000 and some poker tounry and can now play in the big one when ever that is, but holy shit, its not like he needs it, but i suppose if you are good at something than do it right...anyways

      This is my brother Ian trying to do a funnel, it had been a while since he had done this so its excusable, a couple good points of this picture a)his girlfriend is laughing at him in the background b)he didn't spill what was left in the funnel in fact he finished it off once he was done spitting up what was in his mouth...ahhh fun times.  urlLink

       urlLink New Car!  It's been a while since i have said anything on this, but i am going to get back on track, first let me tell you that we just got a new car, we are leasing a 2004 Hyundai Accent GS....mmmm i love it, its far better than my old 94 shadow...nothing against that car but it was time for a change, i tried to drive it home last week and it was over heating, because my water pump was busted and so was my thermostat, so that got fixed up but because of the over heating they said that most likely my head gasket went too, sure enough it did, it still worked but took a while to get going any speed, so we went on the hunt for something new...i'm happy with our choice, i will try to post some pics of it...other than that things have been good, i am hoping to put posts for my deck in this sunday, i really hope we can i want to get going on it so i can use if for at least some of the summer...but we will see, anyways thats all for me today, bye

       urlLink FOXSports.com - Ricky: I failed 3rd drug test before quitting  I love it!  I think this whole thing is so funny, only in the NFL can a star pass up money and fame because he wants to smoke up.  I just think it is funny, he says there are other reasons but really why would you leave so early in your career.  I know but head daigle left early and shit too because he didnt have the passion anymore, and he has come back since, but i dont think owners would want to invest in ricky any more if he is willing to up and leave... i dunno just kinda odd...

       urlLink CNN.com - Boy, 13, dies after running from bear  Isn't it ironic...i know i poke fun and its nothing i should be giggling about but come on!  yeah think you would take off running than look back and see nothing chasing you than stop...and what about the counselor?  do you think he stopped when the kid fell, he probably thought he tripped so the coun. thought to hell with slow poke, i'm saving myself!  so yeah shity deal...
