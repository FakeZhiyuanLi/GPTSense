       FEARS AND PET PEEVES FOR $100 PLEASE   My biggest, most sensitive pet peeve is rudeness! AAAAAAHHH!!! customer service being part of my job, i've been yelled at and hung up on more times than you say the word "and" in one day. and over what? A $5.75 LATE CHARGE?????? granted, SOME people's cases MAY call for us to waive a late charge here and there, but when they ADMIT that they're late because they THREW AWAY their statement, NO WAY MAN! that $5.75 is stayin' on your account and i will bill you until you pay it. and if you don't want to, we're sending it to a collection agency!   a lot of people think i'm pretty even-tempered and that it takes an army of nuisances to get me THAT angry. you should spend a day with me at work and YOU WILL SEE just how this job has toughened me up. sometimes i surprise myself!

      has anyone ever watched  MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING ? i LOVE that movie. the dialogue IS shakesperean so it was a little daunting when the first words came out of emma thompson's mouth. but seeing the action sure helps. i don't think i could read the play and have the same kind of understanding as i do when i can watch it. anyhow, if you ever have a chance to watch it (or you can borrow it from me =p cuz i have the dvd) i think it can teach you a thing or two about love.  so it's called MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING and the first time i watched it i couldn't figure out why they would call it that. well, here's MY take on it. the whole play's got everything you need in a shakespearean plot (this one's a comedy): love, deceit and mistaken identities. throughout the story, people are afraid to admit how they feel for another or just don't realize it until a third party shows them; or they're deceived into thinking the one they love has been untrue...essentially, the whole play consists of people running around in circles, plotting and scheming the futures of someone's love, when all people need to do when they have feelings for someone....is freakin' tell them! what a simple solution. TOO BAD IT'S HARD AS HELL TO DO....and before i go any further on this subject, i'll stop while i'm ahead. on to the next entry...

      i'm so sleepy, but carson on QUEER EYE FOR THE STRAIGHT GUY (one of my new fave shows) said the funniest thing on tonight's episode. he was going thru this guy's closet and he found a mock turtle neck shirt. and he asks jai, "hey you know why these are called mock turtlenecks?" and jai says, "no, why?" and carson responds, "cuz people make fun of you when you wear them." ha ha ha....i was   DYING  !!!!!! ha ha ha...el fin...

      it's almost midnight and I AM BEAT! i actually got myself to drive to the gym to work out tonight. 6:45 pm i tell myself, "you will work out for at least an hour dammit!" and that i did. i even stuck around turbo kickboxing (TKB) class for 20 minutes (riann they're on freakin' round 17!!!). i started with 10 minutes of stretching with  BLISTER IN THE SUN  blasting through the headphones, then  TOO MUCH BOOTY IN THE PANTS   and beyonce's  GOTTA WORK IT OUT   carried me thru 10 minutes on the stairclimber. at this point I AM PUMPED! so i head to the treadmill for 15 minutes, walking briskly to the sounds of black sheep's  THE CHOICE IS YOURS , xtina's  DIRRTY   and sean paul's  GET BUSY . by this time i'm debating whether to stop in on TKB at 7:30 or just use the machines. so i work my arms a bit and at 7:25 i say, okay, maybe for a little bit. so i hop into class, watching the "cool kids" standing right by the platform, kissing ass to our instructor james, and i know what they're thinking as they stare at the not-so-fit people in the class: i am SO what these people should strive to be. i hate to think this but i know it's true. don't get riann and i started on faux pauxs at the gym. you'll be laughing for days!  oh! i went to BEST BUY during my lunch today and i bought LORD OF THE RINGS: THE TWO TOWERS!!!! i'm excited cuz there's a 10 min preview of RETURN OF THE KING. i'm a hundred pages away from the end of the third book and i absolutely cannot wait to see how the third installment will look on the screen.   aaahhhh EXCITED!    it's getting late and i should go to bed. my sister is freakin' hilarious! she's trying desperately to fall asleep cuz it's her first day of 8th grade tomorrow and she needs to wake her ass up at 6:15 am even though she's grown so accustomed to getting up at 11 am! seriously though, i'm excited to see what the year will bring to her. her teacher was MY 7th grade teacher and it's a little hard for me to believe it's been 11 years since i graduated from that place. and now here's tin, in her last year of elementary school. a year from now she'll be in high school.... and when she graduates then...I'LL BE 30!!!!!!!!! the only conselation here? WE'LL ALL BE THIRTY! ha ha ha...that's better. oh man, like sands thru the hour glass....

      TIME...it's something people complain they don't have enough of but often take for granted when they're given too much. this past year i've had the pleasure of attending 8 weddings. a lot of people in my place would've probably choked themselves after the 3rd or 4th matrimonial celebration, but i loved and cherished every minute i got to witness. for those 8 couples time was definitely of the essence. having been given this chance, this day to publicly dedicate themselves to each other in front of their families, friends and God, they epitomized the  Carpe Diem  attitude so many people walk pass, many people like me.   last sunday i came home from san diego, having spent another fun-filled weekend with friends, tired and ready to pass out. as i pulled into the driveway, i noticed the number of cars parked on our side of the street, which you're not allowed to park on. and up the stairs from the garage i climbed, duffelbag, pillows and such in hand, psyched to take a shower and hit the sack, when i saw people were gathered in front of unit #3 (i live in a 6 unit townhouse). as i turned the key in the doorknob, the ambiance became curiouser and curiouser. mom and dad met me at the door and i knew that something had to have happened with the look of disdain in their faces. one of the sons of our neighbor had just exited the freeway to come home at 3 am on friday night, accompanied by his two friends. for a reason i am still unaware of, his car flips over to the other side of the road and burst into flames, killing him and his friend sitting in the front instantly and hospitalizes his friend sittting in the back. his parents were away on vacation in australia when this happened and came home on the earliest flight they could get. i don't even think they were told their son had died at the time of the phonecall. he was only 24 years old, engaged to be married in 2004. he has an older brother, 26, who's married and a 21-year old younger brother. he was literally 3 blocks from home.   all week i've been retelling this tragic story, sometimes wondering why then realizing it's because i don't know how else to deal with it. i mean, i didn't know him at all. we crossed paths around the building every so often, giving way to the other when we're coming in and out of the garage, but that's as far as our co-existence went. his family and friends have been coming to his house for the last week to lend their support and carry out their sympathies to his parents. my grandparents and my parents went to pay their respects too and i SO wanted to go, but couldn't get myself to when it came time to walk 15 feet to their door. my mom says his mom couldn't stop crying, and who could blame her. a parent is never supposed to bury their child.  two weeks ago, my ninong's father passed away in san francisco and tonight my aunt called to let us know she and my uncle are leaving for the philippines tomorrow because his father just died. granted, these two men had lived their lives; they saw their children get married and were fortunate enough to spend time with their grandchildren. but what about the 24-year old who was 2 minutes from home when an uncontrollable force took away his chance at being a husband and father?  we all live by a thread, never knowing when the weight will be too much. and just when it becomes more than it can carry...SNAP! our lives are done, with no second chances to leave off from. everyone's thread is a different thickness, a different density, thereby giving us all various limits of resistance. but only Lord knows the whens and hows of our end. and until then i hope i can learn how to live knowing that the next minute may be my last; that every morning i get to make my bed is a treat more than it is a chore; that every time i sit and have dinner with my family is a moment to value rather than a time to hurry thru; that every chance i get to pick up a friend for coffee is a pleasure more than it is a hassle; and that every second i have to myself is never lonely time, but thank goodness i'm alive time.

      oh i feel so gross! like i feel yeck! everyone's got days when they just feel good. this can be owed to a good hair day (which defines the day for ME) or perhaps a great outfit. i love those days!!! unfortunately, today was not one of them. after i got out of the shower, i said to myself, i'm not going anywhere, i'll just blowdry my hair half-ass and spend the day in shorts and a t-shirt. as i mentioned before, i planned on being a bum and i surely succeeded. i spent my sunday in disheveled hair, unshaved legs (oooh what a pretty picture eh guys?), in my shorts and a UCIrvine tshirt. i sat in front of the tv for 4 straight hours (waiting for my laundry to get done so it wasn't a completely unproductive day) and then it came to me just like that....that awful feeling of sloth....aaack!!! i hate that. so tomorrow begins another stab at getting back on the workout regimen. it's 24 hour fitness at least 3-4 times a week or die!

      so last night i ATTEMPTED to put a tagbox thingy on my blog page and i cannot for the life of me figure out where in the template to put this thing. i know you're all itching to put your 2 cents in on my entries and i can't wait to hear from you...IF I COULD ONLY PLACE THE TAGBOX ON THIS THING!!!...but enough of that. that's a thing to be figured out soon enough. besides, maybe it's cuz i was kinda tired last night. i was trying to get this done at like 1:30 am!   i came home from BJ's at about 12:30 am. i was treated to yet another evening dedicated to conversation, laughter, drinking and eating in the company of such great characters as that of riann, joe, andrew, patrick, edwin, stacy, rochelle and matt. i had exactly $20 in my wallet last night...courtesy of daddy. my dad knows i don't get paid until friday and he practically threw the money at me, knowing my pride wouldn't take such an offer. but i believe there are times when my parents realize that i'm not one for them to take care of anymore (except to provide the hearth which i inhabit of course) and they kinda miss having the all-encompassing financial power. so i copped my dad out of a twenty cuz the thought of a pizzookie was unbearable! no crime here...  anyhow, so i came home, attempted to put in a chatter/tagbox onto this blog when at 1:35 i discovered...anna you suck at this. even joe said so, just ask cile how to do it in the morning. ha ha ha...  this morning i got up at 10:30, read a few pages of a bedside table book and i decided: today i'm gonna be a bum. i had some brunch (cuz it was 11:15 or something by the time i finally went downstairs), watched MIB II all the way thru (it was on HBO), talked to my aunts who came over, played with some pictures on the computer, took a shower...and then went back downstairs to do more nothing. actually i watched something on the travel channel that made me sad...THE COUNTDOWN OF HAWAII'S MOST BEAUTIFUL BEACHES! WAAAAAAAHHHHH TAKE ME BACK! what must i do???...that was my whining for today. my new year's resolution was to CONTROL my whining and complaining. have i been successful? inside i've been really trying...to no avail it seems sometimes but the year's not over yet.   i do miss hawaii though, maybe not so much the beauty of the place itself (although that didn't hurt), but the way i was and the the way i felt when i was there. i put a lot of pressure on that trip long before the  FASTEN YOUR SEATBELTS  signs were lit. and i have never felt so accomplished! i can't remember a time in the last few years where i was THAT relaxed, and THAT content and THAT down to do anything. all the tension in my shoulders caused by repetitive motions (i.e. typing and answering phones. talk about carpel tunnel!) disappeared when we landed in honolulu. what kinda place can do that for you? HAWAII! i think i'll go back next year. anyone wanna come?

      it's 9:33 am, saturday right now and what i wanna know is...WHAT THE HECK AM I DOING UP? well, my cousin christian called and asked for directions to corona del mar. i took my cousins and my sister there on the 4th of july and now look! they're hooked! too bad we have to drive all the way there for clean beach water to swim, boogie board or wade in. i wanna laugh everytime i give directions to get there: 5 south to the 605 south to the 405 south to the 73 south exit macarthur...man! sometimes i can't freakin' believe the number of freeways it takes to get there! and to think we used to drive back and forth from LA to irvine...and to think we did that for 4 years! crazy...  so yesterday my sister was part of this piano contest run buy an organization called AFNA. i couldn't tell you what that stands for so don't ask. all i know is that they're a foundation made up of different music schools and they have this event every year for young pianists and accordion players. anyhow, i didn't make it to her performance like my parents did cuz i couldn't get out of work. but i made it to the radisson hotel by LAX just in time for the banquet and awards ceremony.   let me tell you something about my 13 year old sister. she's not one to get excited or nervous about ANYTHING. riann calls her DARIA and to a certain extent, she sure portrays the MTV cartoon to a T. but tin's piano teacher has been preparing her for this evening for months! and i can't tell you the number of times i've had to listen to her piece, IMPATIENCE, a piece she literally breathed and slept! oh the repition involved on the road to perfection! she had that piece SO perfected she even had time to compose a page or two of orginal music. i'm not talking about some right-handed lullaby. i mean a piece that could rival young mozart (ok i'm exaggerrating but it's really good). anyhow, my sister, in all her talent for art and music has definitely monopolized the right brain genes of our parents. when it comes to levels of creativity, if it's not about scrapbooking, i am at a loss. i remember freshman year at uci when cile used to try to get me to do something artsy with her to devoid my mind of chemistry, physics, calculus and fortran, even for just a moment. and once i did try and the results were nothing short of laughable. all i remember cile saying to me was, "anna, how come everything you draw is symmetrical?" i had never felt so close to my left brain...but i digress...  my parents said that the one area of IMPATIENCE that my sister played through in practice like cake was the one area she misplayed. some nerves finally got to tin! but she isn't one to dwell on such trivialities (is that a word?). at the banquet all the participants received medals; a bronze medallion engraved with the G-clef. and the winners of each category are broken down into different "royal courts." they had categories from 4-7 year old "counts and countesses" to 16 & 17 year old "kings and queens" of the accordion and piano. to put into perspective how huge this event was, let me just tell you that there were 80 tables in the ballroom! 800 people! each seat was filled by hopeful musicians, not to mention even more hopeful parents, waiting for their child's name to be called. i can't even begin to tell you how overwhelmed i was at this place. this 4 year-old girl with blonde curls, clad in a pink dress won in her division for the accordion! 4 YEARS OLD! she was SO cute! close by was a lady with fire-red hair and i heard her call out, "piper, come here" to her 8 year-old pianist daughter who had just come down from the stage after receiving her trophy, proud as can be, with a smile so big you'd think she'd just seen santa claus buying groceries at vons! and oh how all the performers were dressed!! talk about prom! little boys were in suits and tuxes and i even saw a few in barongs. and little girls in their pretty dresses with their hair done. amazing! you just KNEW that this is what they lived for: competition.  the cool thing about this contest? all the kids got trophies! there are the top winners, the runners-up and the honorable mentions. my sister got an honorable mention. to some kids there, not being named the count, or the princess or the duke or the queen was devastating. there was a girl crying in the bathroom cuz she didn't win the top prize. but my sister couldn't be happier with her honorable mention award and my parents and i felt the same. she even got her name engraved on the trophy (they were getting it done there for only $5 regardless of how long your name was!) and it's sitting on top of the piano, draped with her medal. next time you all come over you'll see it. oh the trials of a concert pianist...well, not really but closer than i'll ever be.   it's time to change the bedsheets now. don't have any exciting plans today (WHAT A MIRACLE!!!!!!). i think i'll wash my car. until next time....

      you'll probably get the same kinda entry from cile and joe cuz the three of us, including riann, had dinner at revolving sushi tonight. i already ate a little bit for dinner but saved some room anyhow in hopes that cile or iya would call to finalize our plans for a meal at the great CHO CHO SAN. what is it about this place that draws people back? the restaurant is literally the size of my bedroom and it's murder to get seated in a timely manner sometimes, so much so that extreme hunger can often take over and turn you into this ravenous creature. but oh when you sit down and gaze at the sushi treats on the conveyor belt, you suddenly forget everything, thanking heaven you waited 45 min outside in the cold (or heat) to get a chance to be here. am i exaggerrating? not even in the least. just ask REVOLVING SUSHI's #1 fan: CECILE MARIE FORTUN TECSON, who will drive from work in santa monica and back at 9 in the evening to have some spicey tuna.   so i was talking to cile before dinner tonight and poor thing was just worn out at work and distressed over the fact it was 8:30 pm and she STILL had to return to the "office" and finish up more projects. i admire this girl more than anyone will ever know and it is because of her resiliance that she is where she is. yes she's tired and yes she's under pressure at work, but i know it's okay because this is something she's passionate about. that's what i've been looking for in life, something to be passionate about. i haven't been passionate about a darn thing in YEARS and i've been searching just as long for SOMETHING, ANYTHING that'll give me back some kind of definition again.   so cile posted an entry today about how things happen for a reason and sometimes we just have to accept things as they come, figure out what we can learn from it and apply it towards our next goal. instead of ACCEPTING things, i've been complaining my brains out, settling for what i believe is all i am capable of attaining in life and when all is said, i'm still left with nothing but more complaints cuz i'm too afraid of trying and even more petrified of failing. SCREW THIS! i'm tired of complaining about how unfair my life is, that it seems like i'm the only one getting cheated out of a promising career or relationship. i've discovered this past week exactly how unfair life can be, especially if i LET it play out unfairly. so i'm gonna do something to defy unfairness: more knowledge. the more you know, the better off you are. so iya and i are taking some classes at glendale community college this fall. we're taking an accouting class together (oh the excitement).  at least i'm being active. it's a long way to the promised land of satisfaction, but all great journeys begin with a single step....

      i've become quite fascinated with blogs this last month or so (i know some people have probably had theirs for like years!). to imagine that someone would take time out from their day just to let others know what they've done, how they're feeling or ask for an opinion! what makes these people wanna do this? a few of my friends say that this is a good way to vent (hence the website address) and i thought to myself, "man, i hardly have time to vent in my own journal, for MY OWN sake, let alone sit and type it out for everyone else to read." but then i figured that maybe the reason why i'm so apprehensive sometimes about sitting and typing out my every emotion on microsoft word (how doogie howser is that?) is because i know that i'm the only one who's gonna read it anyhow (until i've passed on that is...ok morbid!) so what's the rush, what's the point? so i can read it 5 years later and reflect on the ass that i made of myself over a boy? or rediscover the innocence of the childhood that i can no longer have? but here i am, ready to type for all of you so i won't be alone in my reflections. thanks for logging on...

       AAAAAAAHHHHH!!! OH CRAAAAAP!!!!   that's what Annie, Ate, Gwen, Leia and I sounded like all saturday, screamin' every few hours as we plummeted from as high as 255 feet in the air to the ground, twisting through corkscrews and hanging upside down on the way. we spent the day at magic mountain to celebrate Annie and Will's birthdays. it's been approximately 7 years since i last visited so everything seemed like new to me...except of course that unnerving feeling of nausea each time we inched our way to the front of the lines. i willingly admit that i am not a big rollercoaster fan. i get all kinds of nervous at the thought of those drops. the hanging upside down doesn't make me feel as sick but oh the 250 ft drop at 85 mph sure make my stomach churn.   so ate, leia, annie, will and i got to valencia at about 10:30 or 11 am. since we were meeting gwen later that afternoon, we decided to forego the newer rides until she got there. so we rode Revolution first. this used to be my favorite ride for some reason, i'm not sure why. after that we headed to viper. we stood in line for what seemed like 45 minutes or so. i forgot how bumpy that ride got towards the end. my head was just bobbling between the headrests --ouch! we met with gwen and then had some lunch.  after some lasagna, we headed to Goliath. i don't know how many of you have been on this ride but it is definitely the scariest i've ever been on because of the very first thing that happens...a 255 foot drop! oh my gosh, i listened to the tick-tick-tick as coaster made its way up the ramp before it shot down to the ground like 50 billion times while we were in line. by the time we finally got to the loading area i was like eeeks, i can't do this. i know i'm such a coward but i can't help it. i was so ready to tell them i'd wait for them at the exit. but i said, screw it anna, just go!...and i did. oh did i scream! i thought we were never gonna hit the bottom the drop was so long! (hey iya, remember how we thought the jurrassic drop was long?...well, that definitely pales in comparison to GOLIATH!). but i made it.  we rode SCREAM after GOLIATH. ate tin-tin is very apprehensive when it comes to twists and turns and upside down motions because she gets sick easily, but somehow we got her on this ride which is all about those things AND MORE. the speed of that ride is insane. it's name is as appropo as you can get. i think we turned over at least 9 times. I LOVED IT! but poor ate couldn't get herself on another rollercoaster after that. she sat out BATMAN, which i LOVE cuz the ride is so smooth. too bad the line was 1 1/2 hours long and the ride lasted oh, 2-3 minutes!!! yuck! that's all i hate about theme parks! lines take up such a significant amount of your day. after batman, Annie, Will, Leia and Gwen headed towards X-TREME. ate and i were like no way man. if you haven't seen this thing it's like this. first of all, there are two seats on each side of the car, hanging on some type of rotar. it turns depending on the motion of the coaster. in other words, it hangs independently from the car itself so you don't know which way the seat will turn if, say, you're entering a corkscrew. i can't explain it but i KNEW i couldn't do it yesterday so ate and i had a little dinner, shopped a little and rode the carousel. ha ha ha...  we got home at about 11 pm already even though we left the park at 9:30 cuz there was an accident on the 5.   whew...what a day! full of screams!!! but i can't deny how much fun i had. there's nothing like a day at a theme park with great company!

       GEEKS!   so i stayed up until about 12:30 last night desperately trying to finish my accounting homework. i didn't get a chance to write it down in class last week and barely got it from iya on monday morning, hence the procrastination to complete assignment. oh boy, chapter 2; t-balances, trial balances, ledgers, recognition...uy ve! i was in a state of vertigo after attempting the nth example of how to correctly assign assets to debit column...or was it to the credit column? no, debit, definitely debit. anyhow, i finished eventually...  iya and are sitting in the classroom at 6:15 pm tonight, chatting away when we start to listen to some of our classmates asking our instructor questions about the homework.   "which question are they talking about, anna?" iya asks.  i shrug. "we did that one last week in class didn't we? that's chapter 1," i say.  "yeah that's chapter 1," iya says. "were we supposed to do problems from chapter 1?"   "no, we did chapter 1 homework last week," i respond.  iya turns around and asks this guy behind us what problem he's asking about.  "oh shit...we did chapter 2 homework!"  we raise our hands and verify with our teacher that those numbers she assigned last week were indeed from chapter 1 which makes us...jackasses.  who needs a vacation?  and then when we were writing up a balance sheet in class, the ending amount was $143,800. iya goes, "hey look anna! i love you boo!"  iya needs a vacation.

       JUST FOR KELSOE   our little baby kelsoe was baptized today. the preparations for such an event usually desire a serious amount of time, but we actually planned everything within a week. my family's pretty (as matt would say) clutch when it comes to parties. we planned the menu, the guestlist and the party favors all on one sunday afternoon.   this blessed day started YESTERDAY when we went out to gather some materials for his giveaways. we spent yesterday afternoon putting them together! then at 10:00 am this morning i woke up and knew it would be a beautiful day. breakfast is served! my poor mom was up until 2:30 am last night softening meat and chopping up vegetables for her kare kare (my favorite yummy!!!), but don't think she slept in. she and my dad were up early cooking, cleaning up, and moving chairs and tables around. we had the party here at my grandparents' house, with MY house (1 door away) as an overflow. anyhow, i was planning to wear this dress to the baptism (i'm one of kelsoe's godparents!) but when i put it on this morning and went to the mirror to fix my hair i was horrified to see that the neckline of the dress was right below the tanline on my chest that i've had since the 4th of july!!! thank goodness i had something else to wear. god that's what i get for being ignorant about sunblock! anyhow, i was ready by noon, we blew up some balloons and then headed off to incarnation church for the main event.  if you read a few entries back i talk about how good kelsoe is and this day was no exception. first of all, he slept all through the readings and the explanation of technicalities. but lo and behold, they were getting ready to bless the kids with oil and he was suddenly wide awake, not making a single sound. there was this one baby girl who cried THE ENTIRE CEREMONY! but not kelsoe. he was so wrapped up with all the people who surrounded him, looking around in sheer wonderment, probably asking himself what he was doing there. not even the pouring of the water on his head bothered him one bit. he's blessed with 8 godparents (filipinos, i swear!). one of his ninongs, tristin and christian's friend erik, even DROVE here from chicago to be at the baptism. how dedicated to this baby and his parents is he? so after we took pictures at the church, we headed home for some food!  and oh was there food!!!! i spent the afternoon taking pictures, carrying kelsoe around and making sure my two cousins, leonard and bernard were entertained for 5 hours. i put Lilo & Stich, Toy Story 2 and Shrek into the DVD player so they would sit in one place all day. chasing them around, we've discovered, is quite a feat so we always opt for the tv. terrible but a must.   we ended the long day watching christian and tristin open all of kelsoe's gifts and envelopes and watched a slideshow of the day on the tv (who loves their digicam? i do i do!). our baby is so young and i can't imagine him any older than the 4 months and 3 weeks that he is, but i know that time will run off faster than we can help it and next thing you know he'll be crawling, then walking, then talking, then reading...THEN DATING! then i'll be really sad. but until then we enjoy his babyhood.

       ROUND 17 -- FIGHT!   yup that's right! i went to TKB (Turbo KickBoxing) this past thursday with fernand (thanks for the great entry about our date my dear). we're on round 17! they change the routine every 3-4 months. riann and i started with round 13 like last summer 2002 and i think we skipped all of round 15 and we did a few of rounds 14, 16 and the bext of round 13-16. i got to the gym about 15 min before the class cuz i wanted to get a few minutes on the stairclimber or treadmill to get my heart pumping before the air-kicking and air-pumping began. it USUALLY leaves me less breathless during the class. i think i should've done like 20 minutes instead of the 10 though cuz i was heaving! fernand and i were like, DUDE WHAT THE HELL! so ummm, raise your hand of you're outta shape -- here here! pick me pick me!  the class was bearable enough. i'd love to just stop but i was getting dressed last week and one of my blouses was tighter than usual...wahhhhh!!!!!! so seriously, i gotta get crackin'. the best part of the evening was hanging out and talking with fernand in front of zono's at the exchange. fernand is freakin' hilarious and he's a good listener. i feel bad i didn't get to buy him his jamba juice though...sorry fernand!!! but i only had a $1 in my bag. and to think he said he would've put out if i paid...next time na lang.   so the search for health begins...AGAIN!

       GET WITH IT GIRLFRIEND!   iya and i were reading our horoscopes last friday at the bookstore (during one of our breaks from studying...which of course occurred before we STARTED any ACTUAL studying) and it mentioned how aquarians (that's me!) thrive on change. and then iya turned to me and said, "how weird cuz you don't like change right?" and i responded, "yes i do! i love change!" and then i remembered something i KNOW i said, to her probably, a few years ago. i said, and i quote, "dammit i hate change." pretty self-explanatory i think. anyhow, yes i do remember saying that and with valid enough reasons, or so i thought.  i love being comfortable. i love finding your niche with something or someone and staying there. i simply adore having friends who i know will be there always...but being here FOREVER would constitute a perfect world for me and we all know that doesn't exist. i guess "changes" for me have involved more relationships than anything. like when your best friends find their boyfriend and/or girlfriend and you sort of phase out of their lives little by little. there is absolutely no stopping this, as i've discovered, no matter how badly you feel. the only way to deal with changes such as this, is to change along with them.  i've discovered that this is my problem. it's not that i loathe change. actually, i love change. change is great! i'm just not good at taking any action to achieve it. i'm learning though, taking some baby steps more than ever these days. i'm hoping there are more years left in this life for me to roll with the punches and go with the flow. it's kind of like riding a rollercoaster. the more you resist the downward speed of the ride and the tighter your grip on the bar, the more you feel the drop turning your insides out. but if you just let go and allow the motion to take you, it's never half as bad as you expected. hmmm...

       SHORT & SWEET   we celebrated riann's 23rd birthday at HOWL AT THE MOON in City Walk last night. She sat on top of the piano and reinacted the LIKE A VIRGIN video in front of the audience and then a couple hours after that she was hurlin' into a plastic bag out on the terrace. as the boys would say, "It was gret!"  so i read the last 85 or so pages of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix saturday morning and i wanna talk about how i feel but i think it would give it away for those who wanna read it. i cried...cuz now i don't know what to do with myself!!!...until the 6th book comes out that is. no but seriously, i teared quite a bit at the end. i asked iya if i could borrow her  A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN  cuz it's a classic i've never read before so after i finish this other book i was in the middle of before i started RETURN OF THE KING, i'll tackle that classic.   ok time for bed...

       DAMN KIDS!!!   iya and i spent friday night at BARNES & NOBLES doing our accounting homework. hot single gals really workin' it aren't we? anyhow, right before it closed, matt and rochelle came to meet us and the four of us headed to coffee bean to meet up with stacy and edweeen. edwin came without stacy cuz apparently she has a midterm to study for so he left her at his house. so the 5 of us sit in front of coffee bean in burbank, a place we often find ourselves on weeknights when we can't stay out too late with work the next day but still feel the need for some friendly company. anyhow, for awhile we're shooting the breeze, going over the recent goings-on in our lives and then we come to a most interesting subject: childhood memories...or in rochelle's case, childhood trauma.  it all started when bobbers said how kids freak her out and of course we laugh at her like she's crazy. why would kids freak anyone out? and she responds, "cuz they're so honest." here began bobbers' stories of traumatic stress as a child, recounts of boys in elementary school who bullied her cuz she was small, someone who tried to strangle her (and this same boy incidentally became my classmate in elementarty school too), and then this one little boy who gloated after she lost an election to him, and two little boys she overheard call her ugly when she was in the 4th grade! TERRIBLE!   then matt remembered how ryan kinda bullied him around freshman year in murphy, and this girl in elementary school who used to take iya's lunch money, and this boy in the 4th grade who when i walked past him in class claimed "damn anna! you're meaty!" you might as well have called me fat, asshole! and then we looked at edwin...edwin WAS a bully (actually still is and is fortified more than ever when he's got allies like joe tag-teaming on everyone) and he made life for this one girl awful in elementary school cuz he called her a horse all the time.  oh man, what we would all give to get back at those who wronged us huh?

       Migraines   oh man, i have the biggest mother of a migraine right now. it's a real wonder i can even sit up and type it hurts so bad! i've been suffering thru this condition all day, debating for 6 hours whether i should ask to go home early or tough it out. but there was so much crap to get done that i didn't get the chance to be a baby and whine that i felt like throwing up right there by the fax machines.   i KNEW this day was gonna suck when i woke up at 8:09 when work starts at 8:30 and i needed 10 minutes to get there! i took a quick shower and got dressed, not having any time at all to even blowdry my hair and YOU KNOW that when my hair isn't fixed my day isn't going to be good. i took a claw to hold my hair back, which proved useless after an hour and half or so when my hair was completely dry and the claw no longer supported the shorter layers. aaaaaahhhhh!!!! and then the biggest kind of headache hit me at about 9:15 and even the motrin was no help.  so when i got home, i took a more satisfying shower, hoping it would ease the head a little bit, got dressed and read another 40 pages of harry potter. but after dinner i was like, AAAACK I WANNA THROW UP! but i don't do the throw-up deal. i hate it. so i lay down in bed, attempting a little peace of mind, which was hard cuz my sister was cackling away on the phone AND typing like a monster on the computer chatting online as well.   ME: dude, don't you have a vocabulary test tomorrow?" TIN: i already studied (continues to cackle and type)  waaaaahhhhh...so my mom comes upstairs and tells me to put the icepack on the back of my neck (it's too cold, i say). she massages vicks on my forehead (why do my parents love vicks?) and then says, "gusto mo mag-suka? sayang wala tayong 7up no?"...for the tagalog imparied: "you feel like throwing up? it's too bad we don't have any 7up huh?" oh mom...  and then i remembered what today was so i tell myself to shut up and suck it up.

       BACK TO SCHOOL   today was my first day of school at GCC (and my dad's 57th bday!!); accounting 105: financial accounting. i admit that the thought of getting back in the classroom worried me a little at first. i can't remember the last time i ever had to take down notes to study. i haven't been in school in 3 years!!! but as soon as the instructor came in, took attendance, and handed out the syllabus, it was as if i'd never left.   iya and i got to campus half an hour before class started so we went to the bookstore to get our books. grand total? $146.14....FOR ONE BOOK! granted, we can use again should we decide to take the next class in the series but STILL!! $146.14???!!! that textbook and workbook cost me more than i paid for registration/enrollment! it looks really useful though. we learned all about the accounting equation today, in addition to writing up financial statements, etc. maybe at the end of this course, iya and i can balance out your incomes...for a small fee of course...ha ha ha...  our instructor is the controller for an architecture firm in glendale and she's been teaching accounting at GCC for the last 5 years. the class itself is about 40+ students strong. it's filled not just with people trying to fulfill a class requirement, but with homemakers, single moms, couriers, jewelers, etc. who just want to further their knowledge on the subject. and i'm guessing we range from ages 21 to maybe 55 years old. there's actually a girl in the class who works for an insurance agency we deal with all the time at work. when we each heard the other's name and who we worked for, we both kinda gasped cuz we talk to each practically everyday! how's THAT for a small world?  i can't believe how excited iya and i both were during and then after the class. maybe it's because we're classmates again (it's been 7 years since we shared a classroom)...hee hee hee, or maybe it's because we feel like we're finally getting active about our futures... or maybe it's the simple pleasure of learning again. iya used to say how she felt like she was getting dumber everyday after she graduated cuz she wasn't in school, and i SO felt the same way. but here we are all into our accounting class! i know what you guys are thinking...GEEKS! hey, at least we're geeks who are learning something applicable to our daily lives. as long as i don't have to apply any knowledge (or lack thereof) of calculus into this class, i'm good to go. a 4-function calculator is all we need? thank heavens!  uy! it's midnight. gotta get going. i wanna read at least one more chapter of HARRY POTTER before i get to bed. until next time...

       IT'S RAINING NUPTIALS!!!   so last night iya and i went to our friend's wedding shower. she and her soon-to-be-husband are getting married in the philippines so this gathering was kinda like their reception with the friends and family who won't be able to attend the actual ceremony. they had it at the crystal springs hall in griffith park. for awhile iya and i were the only ones (aside from the bride and groom) we knew at the gathering until two more of the bride's friends, who are also our friends from high school, arrived. one of them brought her husband and the other girl is married too. these girls are two years older than us and when we were in high school we SO looked up to them. and yesterday we were all reminiscing about the IMAC glory days. iya and i listened for the most part and were beside ourselves laughing at all the antics and drama that high school doted upon us.  and then on the ride home, iya and i were talking about how, in the midst of all the nostalgia, we realized that these girls we admired in high school were now married women and how that could be one of us in 2 years' time. everyone knows how much I love weddings. i love so many things about it that most of you just roll your eyes at me when i start going on about it, but i can't help myself. and seeing and talking to our three friends yesterday just validated exactly how much it can mean, especially to the bride and groom experiencing it.   it's the day AFTER the wedding that the real part of marriage starts. it's the questionable days two people undergo when they're trying to decide if they can afford to buy their own home. it's the time when they're trying to figure out if they're ready to raise a family. all this time i've fallen in love solely with the preparations for the wedding itself; the flowers, the church, the dresses, etc, hardly ever thinking of the more important days thereafter. all i have to say is, i can't wait until one of you gets married cuz i know it'll really be something to remember.

       When We Were in 8th Grade...   last night i drove to sylmar to pick up my sister and some of her friends. tin's classmate, rodney,  had just turned 14 years old (Good God!) and he invited some friends to come over for an after-school partay. i got to the gated community at about 7:15 (cuz tin told me to get them at 7 pm) and was greeted by rodney's mom, mrs. bravo (who used to be a 1st grade teacher at st. francis when i was still there). all the kids were swimming and the oh-so familiar "aaaw man, we're leaving?" came out of my sister and her friends' mouths when they saw me. well, i offered to pick them up later but one of her friends had to be home by 8 so we needed to motor. so the kids went back to the house and got dressed while i waited patiently in the family room talking to mrs. bravo and eating fruit salad. she was like, "so where are you going to school now?" after i answered, "oh, i've been done for 3 years," she let out this "YOU ARE? OH MY GOD HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN?" the last time she knew for sure i was still in school was when she was a teacher's aid and i was an 8TH GRADER!  GOD REMEMBER WHAT IT FELT LIKE TO BE AN 8TH GRADER? to be at the highest post in elementary hierarchy? the ones all the younger kids wanted to hang out with? life was just so much simpler then, with not much to worry about except the beginning stages of adolescence when you're starting to figure out what kind of friends you want to have and how you want them to define you, and then looking forward to passing a high school entrance exam and eventually graduating to begin again at a new school! and OH THE DREAMS we dreamt for our lives in the future, which seemed so far away, felt far more reachable back then than they do now.   just listening to my sister and her 3 friends' conversation in the car was enough to bring me back 11 years. tin and her best friend, josephine, were talking about something girly, while the two boys, raneil (who's sitting shotgun) and j.j. are discussing how they wanna find summer jobs after graduation. raneil's like, "why do you wanna work at KFC for? how much do you think you're gonna get paid?" and j.j. shoots back with, "raneil, man, if i work full-time that's like $250 a week!!!" i remember when i worked at universal studios after high school and $178 a week (net) brought the greatest joy to my life!!! and then they go on to discuss which high schools they wanna attend and why, which leads to living on their own when high school is done. UY! they both just sounded so sure of their plans. this is what i want to happen and that's that. it made me laugh to remember how we used to talk this way about our futures; "after high school, i'll be in college majoring in chemical engineering, and then after graduation i'll work for NASA , and then i can get married." that would mean i would've been married...last year. but THAT'S how i used to think and i know a lot of us had the same kind of vision about our lives.  and here we all are, 12 years after elementary school. this isn't exactly what i envisioned i would be in a dozen year's time but i think i've accepted the fact that things don't always turn out the way you plan them. i'm still waiting (more like hoping) for a lot of things to happen to me and God-willing, i'll be a lot more satisfied with myself in a few years. until then, the dreaming and the visions don't cease. here's to another 12 years to wait and see...

       Helloooo Baby!   i spent almost the entire evening helping take care of and entertaining my nephew, Kelsoe (yes that's his name and it's starting to fit him too!). he's 4 months old now and i can't tell you how much my family adores this baby, especially me! cile's brother and his girlfriend just had a baby girl last night (CONGRATULATIONS NONOY AND MELANIE!!!) and i couldn't stop telling cile how much she is going to love this child. thankfully kelsoe is literally just a few seconds walk away from my house so i get to see him weekly and am constantly amazed at how big he seems everytime i see him.   i don't know what it is that makes me so crazy over this little boy.  he's one of the cutest babies i've ever laid eyes on and he's soooooo good! his hair is forever spikey, we just can't tame it! he's got the biggest eyes and cutest little ears that stick out like his mommy and daddy. he makes sounds when you're looking at him like he's trying to tell you how his day went. my cousins, Keshia and Mari (Kelsoe's dad's sisters) live to harrass our little boy and it's the funniest thing to watch how he smiles and listen to his little giggles. he's starting to teethe too, poor baby. his parents, my cousin christian and his wife, tristin are two of the hippest mom and dad i know, skateboarding and boogieboarding as often as they could this summer, with their little one tagging along in his tiny little rashguard. aaaaaaahhhhhh-dorable!   babies are so cool!!!!!! can't wait to get one of those...

       Addicted...to reading?   Right...i'm addicted to reading. i hadn't realized exactly how much i spent my free time reading until i got back from boston in may. we came home and my dad says to my mom, "all she did on the plane was read!" my poor dad. i was in the middle of  THE TWO TOWERS  when we were heading home from boston and i couldn't put the darn thing down, even to chat with him for an hour or two on the 6-7 hour long journey. let's see, i started reading (for leisure) right after graduation in 2000. i read  THE CIDER HOUSE RULES   while i was in DC (on the subway to and from work), then i started  SNOW FALLING ON CEDARS , which despite Zandro's inquiry is NOT the sequel to  CIDER HOUSE RULES ; then  BLACKHAWK DOWN , then came  HARRY POTTER books 1 & 2 , then i ATTEMPTED to read  THE SUM OF ALL FEARS   and put it down for a 3rd time when i started getting all confused. 3 years worth of history and poli sci classes at irvine couldn't help me with this thing but i'll pick it up again soon when my mind has really cleared hopefully. then at iya's urging i finally read  CHOCOLAT , then  LOVELY BONES  (which was written by my Fiction teacher at irvine, alice sebold. she was interviewed by diane sawyer on GOOD MORNING AMERICA, thank you very much). then i read  HARRY POTTER book 3   which was WOH a lot of information. and right after that i read  HARRY POTTER book 4 . after that i started the  LORD OF THE RINGS   trilogy and now here i am,  HARRY POTTER book 5 . i freakin' read 200 pages yesterday!!!! it was a great rest day...on LABOR DAY, ironically.  i wanted to get an entry in before my fave show QUEER EYE FOR THE STRAIGHT GUY came on. it's on in 15 min so i gotta motor. until next time, remember, DON'T MATCH...COORDINATE!

       THE LONG WEEKEND...which isn't over yet but whatever....   so man! i'm SO HAPPY to be be home on a monday morning. i woke up at freakin' 8:42 am though cuz my uncle called asking if i knew how to get to to cabazon. umm, no so i hopped on the net to get directions for him and now i don't wanna go back to bed cuz i know this great day out of work is gonna whiz by. but let's talk about the weekend cuz it's been funfilled for me the whole time...  on friday night i had dinner at islands with my parents and my sister. it was my parents' first time there (even though we live like 45 seconds away from it!) and they were super-impressed with the food. so funny!! and i had fun too cuz now everything at the restaurant means so much more to me now that i've been to hawaii i loved it! and on the way out, i noticed the "Mahalo!" painted on wall and i was like OH MY GOSH! it just never did anything for me before that moment. uy, i miss hawaii...  then iya and bobbers (rochelle) picked me up and we met up at Gitana with riann, joe, edwin, stacy and matt. we sat there, huffed and puffed outta the hookas and discussed all kinds of random stuff (VMA's, iya's 26TH bday-vegas anyone?, etc) and then headed to krispy kreme's cuz some of us had some FUNDraising cards expiring on 8/31 and we wanted to use it up. i still have one more thingy left to punch on the card but it's cool. you get your $10 worth after you buy the first dozen anyhow. and then yeah, as joe mentioned in his blog, we left at like 1:30 am cuz i have the smallest bladder ever. i thought i could hold it for a few more minutes but the cold air wasn't helping so we boned out. iya dropped me off and i briskly walked to my gate and ran to my door, of course then having trouble unlocking it.   ...hey random... if anyone happens to be watching tv (especially in the morning) turn to the cbs news, channel 2 and watch out for my old high school classmate tatum wan, she's a reporter!!! how cool is that!  the next morning i got up at 9:30-ish and finished THE RETURN OF THE KING!!! oh it was so good! i can't wait for the 3rd LOTR movie!!! I CAN'T I CAN'T I CAN'T!!! i think i'll watch the first two movies today =). so my parents decided to head to solvang and camarillo that morning. my sister and i were just too damn lazy to be walkin' around good ole' fake denmark, so we stayed home. she worked on her research paper on mars (she's only had 3 DAYS of school and she already has a research assignment due) and i did laundry ALL DAY! i swear you wonder how many people live in this house cuz i folded 5-6 baskets of clothes! leia came over to hang out with me as consolation though. we sat at the kitchen counter for literally 45 min to an hour just looking thru her catalina, hawaii and south america pictures. YOU ALL HAVE TO SEE HER SOUTH AMERICA COVERAGE!!! AWESOME!!!!!! as i folded the laundry, she crocheted her scarf and we were like, "let's watch dvd's! how about something that takes place in hawaii...LILO & STITCH?...nah...OOOH BLUE CRUSH!" so we sat there, watching, reminiscing, crocheting and folding. for dinner my sister, leia and i headed to, where else?...REVOLVING SUSHI! leia's a real trooper when it comes to this place! the girl will drive from all the way from tustin or whitter on a weeknight to eat here. as usual we came outta there stuffed and satisfied! we couldn't breathe from all the sushi we devoured so we decided to hang out at media city center to do an hour of walking. then we went back to my house and watched CHICAGO. sidenote: my biggest fantasy (get your mind outta the gutter joe and edwin)? to sing in a broadway musical. it's too bad you have to have talent to do something like that.  anyhow, sunday morning we went to mass, had lunch with my family, took a nap then i picked up ate tin-tin for our date. we had dinner at islands before we headed to the concert. you people can tease me all you want, but the AMERICAN IDOL 2 concert (yes, we went to go see clay and ruben and the gang) was fun as hell! those people can SING! the circumstances may be corny (or ANG PAKA-MAIS as jhoette would say) but they were all really good last night. ate and i already knew that our favorite clay and ruben, kimberley and trenyce could sing on the show but DUDE, we all know seeing someone perform live makes them sound like 10 times better. ate and i were very impressed with all 9 of them (josh, corey clark and that punkish chick vanessa weren't there). even julia damato, who i thought was just a nervous wreck on the show everytime she performed by herself was good. i guess performing in concert for 2 months built her confidence. it was the last concert of their 40-city tour so the evening was chock-full of thank-yous and that extra bit of energy. they sang mostly covers. clay and ruben sang a song each from their first albums due out this fall. can i just tell you that i have never seen so many adults at a concert that you'd THINK would be for youngens? i mean, we've all seen a bunch of kids with their moms and dads at *NSYNC concerts and you KNOW they're there to chaperone. but we saw freakin' 40 year old men and women HOWLING when their favorite idols sang...and they were there without kids! this whole row in front of me and ate were like 50 year olds! and then this lady next to me was like biggest ruben, clay and kimberley locke fan ever. HILARIOUS! ate and i were screaming and clapping the whole night it was so fun! say what you must to me, but they were really good last night. i honestly wasn't expecting too much, wondering how they could put a concert together. but it was really good, a really fun time!!! it made me miss my boys (*NSYNC) though, but don't even get me started on this or i'll get sad.  until later...

       Famous One-liners   i just finished watching the last 15 minutes of  Jerry Maguire  and i never realized how many one-liners came out of this movie: "Show me the money!"..."You complete me."...and "You had me at hello." gosh, what great dialogue! and what about movies like  Sixteen Candles  with sayings like, "What's a-happenin' hot stuff?" said by the ever-popular exchange student Long Duk Dong? isn't it cool how lines like this can stick for years? look at Robert Deniro and his, "you talkin' to me?" line or Marlon Brando's "We'll make him an offer he can't refuse." that's just crazy how long ago those movies were made and still when you turn on the tv today, practically 30 years later, someone's quoting them.  that's it random. had to share that with ya'll. can YOU think of any more famous one-liners?

       Paging Nurse Riann...   i stayed home AGAIN today. i know i know, lucky! ha ha ha...no but seriously, i still feel really blah. i got ready this morning and everything, but when she heard me coughing and sneezing my way through every sentence, my mom said, "Hay naku. stay home na lang ikaw ngayon." and i did. my dad stayed home from work too. am i just infecting everyone? today was the same kinda day friday was. i took my mom to work (as ailing as i was) and then came home to watch all the brush fires that seem to have spread across southern california. i don't mean to be insensitive or anything, but ideas of arson have come to mind. i'll just leave it at that.  but anyhow, i'm feeling a little bit better. on friday i got a surprise visit from riann! she called me on her way home from work, interrogating me on my diet that day and such and i told her i wasn't that hungry and we didn't have any soup in the house. so she bought me soup from quizno's and had her lunch with me. i was so touched! thanks riann! i really appreciated it! i've been eating soup all day today! and i've been drinking to much water that my pee is clear! (sorry for the mental picture but i thought that was kinda cool). anyhow, can't seem to eat anything too heavy...which is a good thing.  ok, gotta study for some accounting quizzes. until next time...

       GOD SAVE THE QUEEN   Have you ever been at work, staring as the clock ticks second after agonizing second like it knows you’re waiting for it to hit 5:00 so you can go home? WELL GOD BLESSED IT’S HAPPENING TO ME RIGHT NOW! And I’m so moving, typing and speaking to customers on the phone ever-so-slowly like it’ll make the slightest difference in expediting the passage of time...so today is actually the next day and i'm home sick with the flu. maybe i'll write a blog...oh look here comes one now…  So Fantone called me wednesday night because her dad was wearing the Cambridge University polo that she bought for him 4 years ago. Apparently this brought her immense nostalgia. “Anna let’s go back!” she screamed. And I had to second her. At 25 years old, I can confidently say that I’ve been fortunate enough to have had my share of travels (with hopefully more to come). And my 6 weeks in the UK has proved to be one of the most rewarding experiences I’ve ever had. Who knew the British could be so fascinating? Correction, you can’t call everyone who lives in the UK “British.” There are the English, the Scottish and the Irish from Northern Ireland. We were made aware, very early on, that Scottish and English people can sometimes be, ummm, sensitive to the other. I remember Professor Dawson, our instructor for British Social and Cultural History, saying, “Oh those Scottish, like to paint themselves blue and fight!” I didn’t get it until I saw BRAVEHEART. Ha ha ha…and then when we were in Scotland for a weekend, one of our teacher’s aids, Kadia, told us that some Scottish bloke tried to hit on her, but upon hearing she was visiting from Cambridge, soon after walked away. Okay strict about your women!  So how many people can say that after class they spent the afternoon punting up and down the river? Punting is maneuvering this small boat with a wooden stick long enough to touch the river floor. It’s so much harder than it looks, lemme just tell you. I didn’t do any actual punting but watching other people do it just wore me out! =) it was cool to have it as an option to spend the afternoon though.   i miss the pub-hopping: people go to pubs there as often as they go to the loo (the bathroom)! i miss qeueing up at the cafeteria to see the lady who sits in a booth and sells baguettes. oh man just thinking of the melted swiss cheese mixed in with scallions and bacon in a warm french baguette makes my mouth watah! i miss eating in the hall that seriously looked like the hogwarts dining hall...the tube in london, the random rainstorms (like we would go into class with the day as sunny as can be and then come out an hour later protecting ourselves from the rain!), the fish 'n chips (as oily as they were), covent garden, big ben, the cute teacher's aids (especially tim and mark...oh if orlando bloom was one too i would've asked for some help with my poli sci paper =P) and more!  what i loved most was the company. i met lots of new people, but remained as attached to cecile "i'm egyptian now" tecson, tommy "take us punting english girl / i hate my room" carague, jean "prince edward nga eh" ilano, christine "if i don't fall off this bed i'll get electrocuted" fantone, and andrew "better take my dramamine before every bus ride" boquiren.   man, all that made me think...maybe i'll go watch BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM right now...until next time mates, CHEERIO!

       Lo Siento (I'm Sorry)   so we're all sitting in edwin's living room tonight and as usual, there is a constant ravage of hitting below the belt between everyone present. although all of us should be used to this by now, everyone still has their sensitive buttons; the very ones that can set you off on this defensive stance as soon as one word is uttered about it. i know i've got mine. some things i deny being sensitive about because i don't feel the need to create a big hoo-ha about it. i'd just try to hold myself down if it ever came up even though i know better. anyhow, so we're "joking around" and joe makes a remark and i must have responded awfully sarcastic that he thought i was truly angry (which i'm 100% sure i wasn't) and he left the room with edwin and matt.   at first i couldn't understand why joe would be so upset, but then cile tells me that i sounded like i snapped back at him and i felt really bad after. riann (who is big on channeling feelings and talking about everything) suggested i discuss it with joe so that he doesn't continue to think that i was angry at his comment. but since i wasn't mad, i didn't feel the need to talk about it. so i've been thinking about this eversince joe left the room, until now that it's 3:26 am and again i am faced with another problem area in my life: communication.  i think i'm horrible at it. i am the queen of suppression! you can call me passive,a push-over, etc. but that's how i work. i don't like making people angry, and if they already are, i don't wanna feed the fire so i don't talk about it. sometimes if i feel someone has wronged ME, i create a whole dialogue in my head of what i'm gonna tell this person but that's as far as the conversation goes because, I DON'T WANNA MAKE THEM FEEL BAD! or maybe, i just don't trust a whole lot of people so i'd rather hold in my feelings. i know that i have a big issue with trust. as i'm sure all of you have experienced, once you lose confidence in someone, it's hard to believe in them, and anyone else in your life, ever again. i'm reminded time and again that if  you want to keep something a secret, you should really just keep it to yourself. once you tell someone, it's not a secret anymore and you are liable for this secret's distribution.   but i digress...my whole reason for this entry was to recognize that i have a communication issue to work out with myself. i am so good at telling people to talk to whomever they are having problems with when in actuality, i can hardly do that myself. second of all, i do wanna apologize to Joe for sounding mean. it wasn't your comment that got me to say what i said. you know i'll take whatever you boys have for me. there are real issues deeply-rooted inside that i have to deal with and i'll gladly explain it to you as soon as we get the chance. call it the beginning stages of OPERATION ANNA COMMUNICATES.

       Healthy? Not me!   so yesterday i took a blood test cuz i told my ninang, who's a doctor, that my i was finding it very hard to breathe on monday morning. it wasn't that i COULDN'T breathe, but it just felt really uncomfortable and of course i got kinda scared. so it's been about a year since i've gotten any lab work done for my health so she draws blood yesterday morning.  my ninang comes to visit me at home tonight to tell me that my cholesterol and my triglycerides are high! not just high for MY AGE, but HIGH period. i'm not even gonna tell you the numbers she gave me cuz it creeps me out everytime i think about it. anyhow, i bet the reason i was finding it so hard to breathe is cuz my arteries are clogged! so she gives me the rundown of everything that i MUST MUST MUST avoid: dairy products (this includes cheese, ranch dressing, and yes, milk for my freakin' cereal even), carbohydrates (which is everything i eat) and junk food in general (no more sweets and fast food for me). she advised that i stick to fibers and vegetables and fruits for now. i might as well graze with the cows and sheep in Scotland! either that or i should just stop eating altogether!  but i can't complain, cuz this is what i get. i don't have any self-control when it comes to food cuz gosh, WHO DOESN'T LOVE TO EAT? but now it's gotten to a point i never thought it would and it's time to get serious about my health. so if we're ever out and i order a salad, please don't ask why i'm having just a salad cuz it'll just make me feel bad. UY! i don't even wanna get out of bed tomorrow knowing i have to give up what i know i have to give up. oh well, such is life. too much of a good thing can really kick you in the ass! wish me LOADS OF LUCK cuz the will power to better myself physically is in the process of getting built up still. UY!

       FOOTBALL ANYONE? no JOE, REAL FOOTBALL!   hey kids! have any of you ever watched BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM? well, i saw it last night and i thought it was a great movie! it's about an indian girl who loves football (soccer to us Americans) but is chastised continuously by her traditional indian family who believes she should be more concerned with learning how to cook indian food and nabbing an indian groom rather than wasting her day striving to be as awesome at soccer as her idol, David Beckham. keira knightley from Pirates of the Caribbean is in the movie too. so it's got a simple plot and that's what i love about it; no excessive violence, sex or confusing storylines. the movie follows a young girl who must deal with her passion for a sport while at the same time coping with cultural opposition. i'll leave the synopsis at that. by the way, it's pretty funny too! i love listening to the british talk! anyhow,  go see it!

       What's My Name   one day in the 8th grade, we were talking about identity and how our names take part in that identity. our teacher told us to give ourselves a different name for the day and we were to call each by our new names. i thought about it for awhile and i picked the name, Cherisse for some reason. i think i had just heard it the day before or something but i thought it sounded pretty. anyhow, during lunch a bunch of my classmates and i started looking at each and tried to figure out a fitting name for that person. my old classmate, Ben, turned to me and said, "anna, you look like a BETTY." i do? hmmm, that would've been weird.   but weird is what my aunt WANTED to name me when i was born. some of you probably won't remember this, but in sesame street, during those cartoon breaks, this little scribble of a girl would come out from the side of the white background and yell, "WILLHEMENA WILLHEMENA!!" and then just leave. THAT's what my then 12-year old aunt told my parents she wanted to name me. CAN YOU IMAGINE? in the end my mom and dad decided to name me after a girl in a soap opera. i look at myself in the mirror every morning and the girl i see is anna. WILLHEMENA? i don't think so. Anna Lissa Bautista Gonda...that's my whole name. could you BE anymore Filipino than that?   but names are such a big deal. could you honestly see yourself with another name, except of course maybe for the chicks who plan to get married and change their LAST name. anyhow, that's all. if you could have another name what would it be? i know what iya would want us to call her...

       LIFE FOR RENT   everyone's all cd reviewing so i thought i'd jump the bandwagon and tell you about DIDO's new cd "Life for Rent." maybe you think someone who's obsessed with *NSYNC and loves to sing and dance around to the bubble sound that is pop music couldn't possibly be interested in listening to someone as mellow as Dido. well, i heard her NO ANGEL cd and i must say that after that i was just drawn to her melancholy, whisper of a singing voice. that's one reason i love listening to norah jones' cd, but that's another entry.   anyhow, there's one song on Dido's cd that really got to me. it's the title track, "life for rent." just take a glance at the lyrics and tell me it doesn't make you think:   life for rent    i haven't ever really found a place that i call home i never stick around quite long enough to make it i apologize that once again i'm not in love but it's not as if i mind that your heart ain't exactly breaking it's just a thought, only a thought    but if my life is for rent and i don't learn to buy well i deserve nothing more than i get cos nothing i have is truly mine    i've always thought that i would love to live by the sea to travel the world alone and live more simply i have no idea what's happened to that dream coz there's really nothing left here to stop me it's just a thought, only a thought    but if my life is for rent and i don't learn to buy well i deserve nothing more than i get cos nothing i have is truly mine    while my heart is a shield and i won't let it down while i am so afraid to fail so i won't even try well how can i say i'm alive    but if my life is for rent and i don't learn to buy well i deserve nothing more than i get cos nothing i have is truly mine   this song could have a hundred different interpretations. but here's what it is to me. if you ever happen to wonder what the meaning of life is for you, and you can't, for whatever reason, figure out what that is. ask yourself about the last time you took a chance on an opportunity. did you seize the day or just tell yourself you were gonna fail at it anyway so why bother trying? how about the last time you asked yourself why you're alone. have you passed up chances to meet people because you're scared they won't think much of you? ever forbade yourself from feeling any kind of romantic feelings for someone because you can't remember the last time that emotion didn't fail to hurt you?   well, here it is folks. life is about taking chances, taking initiative. when i was younger i felt like this came naturally to me. teachers and bosses called me a "self-starter." but i know that for a lot of us, life seemed to slow down and the ability to "self-start" became harder and harder to maintain. i know my starter was cold for the last 3 years, but i feel like it's coming back to me. and not because i waited for it to warm up again, but because  I   decided put the heat back into it  MYSELF . i don't want my life to be for rent, not having invested any kind of genuine risk in a venture. i don't wanna look back at my twenties when i'm 60 (god-willing i live that long) and say my life was a wasteland of missed chances. i've been reminded time and again in the last year that there is no courage without fear and there is certainly no victory without trial.

       I JUST WANT MY ID!!!!   oh man, what does it take to get your ID at GCC??? so first of all, you can't park on the lot across the street before 6 pm cuz there's a great big sign that says, "NO STUDENT PARKING. FACULTY AND STAFF ONLY" and they've got this security guard sitting by the entrance. so i drive around until about 5:55 (mind you i got out of work at 5!) when finally i'm like SCREW THIS i'll just drive into that parking lot cuz everyone else is. and lucky me, someone had just come out and i got a space quickly. so i put in 42 min worth of coins cuz all i had was a quarter and a dime. i'm thinkin, i'll be back in plenty of time. so i cross the bridge to get to campus and HI, i have no idea where i'm going. i go up some stairs, walked through a building and back to the library to ask where this place you get a student ID is. i go up these stairs...again, and find the room and i get there and the lady's like, "your ID isn't paid for yet. you have to pay for replacements." i'm like huh? so she sends me to admissions and i ask the lady at the window, "haven't i already paid for the ID?" and she said, yeah, when you started....in '97! joe and i took a geography class in the summer of '97 and THAT ID is paid for along with the fees. THIS ID is a replacement and costs $10!!! so i pay the damn $10 and head back to the picture lady and i take the damn STUDENT ID picture and you can SEE in the photo what i felt like after all that ruckus. i get back to my car and there is 9 min left on the meter. IT TOOK ME FREAKIN' 33 MIN TO GET A STUDENT ID! the whole process could've taken 10 min but it took me 33!!!  so i let out all my frustrations at TKB tonite with fernand. i don't know what it was about tonite's class but i was superduper exhausted after the thing. fernand said his vision was all blurry after. ha ha ha...  i ended the evening with a hilarious episode of WILL & GRACE, then a gratifying shower, then ER, and bits and pieces of BROWN SUGAR in between. has anyone seen that movie? the parts i saw seemed kind of interesting so i wanna watch the whole thing. any opinions?  ok, it's time for bed! i'm pooped!

       Missin' the Mall   no, not the glendale galleria or the beverly center, the Mall in washington, DC where the Capitol Building, the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial are placed in perfect alignment. i've been on WEST WING overload eversince Bravo has been airing the old episodes. even though i've seen the episode like 2-3 times over, i always notice something when i watch it again...like i how much i miss being there.   so here lies the very source of emptiness i feel inside every so often. i do miss living there in our nation's capital. i miss getting up at 6:45 am because i need to be at the crystal city metro stop at 8:10 to catch the blue line headed towards addison road. i miss running my prepaid metro card through the "doorway" with the rotating wheel so i can get to the escalator leading to the track. i miss sitting on the stone bench in the tunnel waiting for the train to come and then getting up because i notice the round warning lights flashing by the track indicating my ride's close proximity. i miss standing in the train, with one hand tightly gripping the pole and the other clutching a book open, never wavering to the constant braking. i miss the 30 seconds or so where the track is above the ground giving me just enough time to look up and see the pentagon on the left. i miss watching men and women in uniform loading and unloading at the pentagon metro stop. i miss getting off the train and walking towards the office in the clockwork manner that i became accustomed to as if my feet led the way. i miss taking the elevator to the 11th floor and saying GOOD MORNING to everyone who i so loved working with. i miss having lunch down the street at HIGH NOON, and getting to walk past the white house like the most powerful man in the world didn't live there. i miss coming home after a long day to my roommates who are truly 5 of the most unique people i know. i miss standing in the balcony where you can see the monument and the capitol building in the distance. i miss going to mass at st. matthew where JFK's memorial service was held or the Basilica, the largest church in the north america. i just miss it all.  so yes i decided to come back home to sunny cali, hoping my fortune would somehow continue after the momentum i experienced in DC. but i was wrong and the momentum stayed on the east coast as i had feared and here i am, a little confused and at times, completely aimless. i don't regret coming home because i know there was a reason i did, but a part of me will always wonder what would've happened if i had just stayed there for another year. rest assured it won't have been my last time there. i'll go back.

       Gracias!...Merci!...Salamat!...Thank You!   Thanksgiving day for me is typically comprised of morning mass, helping out with the meal preparations, entertaining family and of course...EATING! I love eating! IT'S SO AWFUL! But I couldn't help it. Our thanksgiving table was adorned with the best food my family could provide;  turkey, spaghetti, pad siyew, baked salmon, popeye's chicken, etc. you know, Filipino thanksgiving food.  But the best part of my day would have to be looking after my nephew, Kelsoe. He's 7 months now! So big is he, crawling, standing up, and chattering away what sounds like gibberish to me but must mean so many things to him. He fell asleep while I was feeding him yesterday afternoon and as sore as my arm was getting, I SO didn't care cuz I love this baby so much.  Ok, I'm a bit tired so I'm gonna end this now before I get really carried away. I spent part of the day helping my aunt decorate her house for Christmas and the rest helping my parents and my uncle paint our living room, and then playing taxi for my sister. My neighborhood is so chaotic this time of year because I live behind the mall. Seeing all that traffic got me even more fatigued. Until next time, I hope everyone had an excellent thanksgiving!

       Rude Awakening   Have you ever had a dream that seemed so real that you could feel your heart beating, hear yourself breathing and feel someone's touch? This has happened to me all too often and I get so frustrated when I wake up because it wasn't real. It happened to me again Sunday night. I won't disclose the details of the dream but I woke up Monday morning and said, "I KNEW IT! OF COURSE IT WAS A FREAKIN' DREAM!"  Well, I'm a dreamer and a thinker. I have an ultra-active imagination and I've overanalyzed practically everything about my life (and probably some other people's lives too). I go lie and think about at least 10 things before i finally fall asleep, and then I wake up thinking some more. It's really no wonder I have the dreams that I do!! I just wish that sometimes I could catch a break and not have to wake up from something that felt perfect. Maybe tonite it'll be different...How Anna? Apparently I wish to live in my dreams forever...hmm...we'll see...

       ***NEW FEATURE***   I just got an idea folks. When we were taking US History during our sophomore year at IH, our teacher, Mr. West used to give us a WONDERFUL WOMAN of the WEEK to learn about. So every week I’ve decided to do a variation and introduce or re-acquaint you all with the people in my life through the  GETTING TO KNOW YOU   series. You know the saying, “tell me who your friends are and I’ll tell you who you are?” Well, maybe this’ll give you all more insight into why I am the way I am if you know who I’m related to and who I’m friends with. That way, if you don’t like me, then you know who to blame…hee hee hee…Let's see who the first victim is...   Getting to know...     ROCHELLE T. GALACE aka BOBBERS    Vitals:  Met in 1982 at my aunt and uncle’s party and had scattered meetings for a couple years, then lost touch until we became classmates for 4 years at Immaculate Heart High School  = 20 years and counting  Role in my Life:  Unconditional Supporter – If all I need is a kind word of comfort or someone just to be on my side, this is my girl.  Good Times:  Lugging around our Poochie (remember that cute pink dog?) collectibles when we were tinier tots =)   In her own words:  “69? Does that mean there are positions 1-68?”

       ChILLIN’ Again…   Last night, Iya, Randy, Bobbers, Joe, Riann and I had dinner at Noodle World in Pasadena then treated ourselves to an evening of original music at McMurphy’s. I finally got to see ILL AGAIN perform and now I fully understand the hoopla that surrounds these guys. I’m no hip-hop connoisseur but I know what’s pleasing to the ear and their music really was. A 6-member band consisting of 2 guitarists (1 bassist), a drummer, a multi-faceted instrumentalist and 2 emcees, they filled the room with a solid following bobbin’ their heads to the beat of their sounds. Exceptional lyricists, their set was nothing short of unique and I do look forward to seeing them perform again.  What made the night even more happening was seeing our high school classmate, Jimelle. We haven’t seen her in 2 years and it was great seeing such a familiar face in the crowd. Catching up with old friends is always fun. I think the comedic moments of the evening were,. by and large, the dancing showcase of 3 women. One lady, who was dressed like a stewardess and was easily 40+ was by the stage, drink in hand, shakin’ her booty to the DJ. And then there were these two other gals who were dancing so furiously (I don’t know why, the music wasn’t that fast-paced) and they were literally bumping in to everyone around them. Randy and I were so ready to be like, “Will you please calm down? You’re all up in our space!” but we didn’t. We’re not squabbers.  Ok, time to get back to work. I keep forgetting I’m here. Which reminds me, did you guys read that article in blogspot about blogging at work? Ha ha ha…hilarious!

       "You're Justh Jealousth" - Mark Wong   yeah, i was jealous today and let me tell you why. so before we get our midterms back our teacher gives us this whole lecture about if you haven't done well in this class, please consider dropping and taking it again or study harder and do extremely well on the final, etc. so all of us are thinking, "oh crap, we must've done horribly on the midterm for her to be talking like that." so she goes on to say that we all did fairly well, and out of a possible 200 points, one person got a perfect score + the extra credit making their score 205 points! no it wasn't me (i wish). it was IYA!!! (sorry randy. i only got 185.5/200. i haven't upped iya ONCE this semester. i know you're disappointed in me. hee hee hee...) so yeah, IYA GOT A FREAKIN' PERFECT SCORE ON THE MIDTERM AND SHE GOT THE EXTRA CREDIT POINTS SHE DIDN'T EVEN NEED CUZ SHE'S GETTING LIKE AN A+ IN THE CLASS!!!!!!! AND THEN, when we were going over the test i'm writing in corrections with a black pen to study for later and iya turns to offer me her red pen. WHY CUZ YOU DON'T NEED IT MISS I GOT A HUNDRED? WHY DON'T YOU JUST SAY IT! YOU SUCK AT ACCOUNTING ANNA! hee hee hee...THIS IS FUN! (randy where are you when i need to gang up on iya?) hee hee hee... i'm just playing, girl, friend.   but oh, what a geek! =) no, in all honesty, this girl is the only person i've been extremely jealous of since the day we met but can't help loving to death. why is this? maybe cuz she doesn't flaunt her success with everything in my face (except for the red pen incident that is...i'm kidding, i'm kidding). anyhow, i made a lot of careless mistakes on that exam. i second-guessed myself in practically all of the items i got wrong. never again. always go with your 1st choice!  ok that's it. i've made 3 different entries today. i might not have anything more to blog about at work tomorrow if i continue this.

       WHO NEEDS NAPSTER WHEN YOU’VE GOT ATE CYN?   Last night I went to bed kinda late. No, I wasn’t studying or doing homework or suffering from insomnia. Actually, I was chatting online with Ate Cyn cuz she was transferring Britney’s new cd via AIM to me. I swear I don’t think Ate Cyn’s bought a cd since downloading music over the internet or cd burning was made possible. So ummm…1999 then?  Thanks again Ate Cyn! Same time tonight? Hee hee hee…   I’m listening to the Britney cd at work right now. I’d have to say it’s not the best cd I’ve ever heard but it’s one of her better ones. I’m not really listening to anything she’s singing but the beats are pretty phat, very danceable. There IS this one song that I listened real carefully to though, #12…don’t know what it’s called, let me go check…oh it’s called  Everytime . And she’s all “my weakness caused you pain.” Hmmm…wonder who she’s talking to. I guess it’s kind of a response to Justin’s  Never Again  cuz he said something about her not even saying sorry and she DOES say sorry in this song. Am I really analyzing this? I apologize but I LOVE doing that! Anyhoo, it’s pretty cool. Have a listen if you get a chance. So far Ate Cyn’s favorite is #2,  I’ve That Boom Boom  (I THINK that’s what it’s called) which I like too cuz it’s a fun song. Iya and Joemama have shown interest in  Toxic . That one’s got a cool beat to it too. I love that word…”beat.” Ok enough…just go listen to it.    OH LEGOLAS   So I went to Best Buy during my lunch ( I swear I wanna live there!) and I’ve got 3 words to describe the experience – CA-RAY-ZY! Everybody and their dog was there, in line to buy the  TWO TOWERS : extended version (didn’t you know dogs love  LORD OF THE RINGS ? =). It was only $24.99! The one with BOOKMARKS costs like $56.99! (inside joke) I SO can’t wait to go home and watch it. Too bad I have class tonight. It’s okay though. After class I’ll come home, watch the new episode of the season for QUEER EYE (I’M SO EXCITED!) and then watch some of the extra footage in the dvd. I act like someone’s gonna take away my TV tomorrow or something huh? I can’t help it. Ok, I guess I should go do some work now. I AM at the office.

       Outta the Bitter Barn   i am no expert when it comes to falling in love. i'm not even close. in fact, i've made it a bad habit to denounce this emotion, this state of heavenly bliss for many of my friends, hoping that it would keep me from longing for it. alas, this bitterness can only last so long because as fate would have it, I'M A SAP.   on saturday evening, iya, edwin, randy and i had the pleasure of sitting with a few thousand other filipinos at the grand olympic auditorium in downtown to watch a SIDE A / FREESTYLE concert. i swear it felt like pcn. anyhow, if you're not familiar with these two bands, they hail from back home and are as entertaining as can be. the highlight of the evening for me would either have to be iya, edwin, randy and i dancing along during their upbeat sequence or their rendition of HOT IN HERRE! ha ha ha...but one of the reasons i love their music, as well as so many filipino artists, is because of their beautiful ballads. one of the songs that they performed last night was  GOT TO BELIEVE . if you don't know the song, watch  ZAPPED!  starring scott baio. and if you don't already know, this song was sung on the soundtrack of the movie with the very same name.  inspired, i decided to watch  GOT TO BELIEVE  while i folded laundry today (i have the VCD). time and again, i will watch this movie and every ounce of spite i have for love, or lack thereof, disappears. if you watch tagalog movies often, you've probably seen this movie and can understand why i love it so much. it actually reminds me of one of my other favorite movies, WEDDING PLANNER.  anyhow, it's about this girl, who's a wedding planner, who dreams and aches to marry someday soon. she becomes acquainted with one of their photographers and let's just say he helps her find someone. you know where this goes right? i don't wanna spoil it for you.   anyhow, the couple playing the couple in the film was together in real life and they showed footage of them promoting their film at the end of the movie and what gets to me is the love you see in their eyes, especially his (Rico Yan, may he rest in peace). you see the way he looks at her and you just know, it's so obvious he's in love. and it just got to me. how unbelieveably special is that? yesterday i caught the last 45 minutes of  A WALK TO REMEMBER  and i can't say enough for the character that shane west plays.  he meets this girl who he falls in love with and does everything he can to show her that he loves her and i was so touched by it.   i know these are only actors playing parts in a movie, but they're portraying the grandest emotion of all and it gets me everytime. when i witness this, yes i feel jealous, but at the same time i gain a small ounce of hope that it can happen, and it can happen to me. but what kind of angel does a person have to be to feel this way? i wonder...

       Red Pill, Blue Pill   Iya's sister-in-law, Ate Jenny works for the company who processes permits for movie studios to film in certain locations. She gave Iya 2 passes to the  MATRIX REVOLUTIONS  screening on the Warner Bros lot and iya took me! (THANKS AGAIN ATE JENNY AND IYA! I HAD SO MUCH FUN!) everyone i know who has seen this movie can't seem to find too many great things to say about it. so iya and i went in there expecting a fluke, minus the effects. people have said it's corny or whatever and i can kinda see why they would say that, but i don't think the dialogue was even half as corny as the dialogue in STAR WARS EPISODE 2. THAT movie freakin' killed me, especially during conversations between amidala and anakin. granted hayden christiansen is FINE, the movie was all effects, weak story.  but back to the MATRIX...we thought it was cool. it made loads of points about destiny and sacrifice and chances. maybe to the discerning eye of a superfan, the movie may have lacked in some areas, but i liked it. i have to admit that i'm at a loss as to what happened in the 1st two movies (which i'm planning to re-watch to understand the 3rd more), but nonetheless, the movie satisfied as much as i expected from it.   after the movie iya pointed me towards a part of the lot where ER films certain scenes and as a diehard ER fan i was like AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M HERE!!! where Noah Wyle and Maura Tierney and Sherry Stringfield and George Clooney walked around! oh! on monday when we spent the day at the Grove, I saw Sharif Atkins from ER! he's the doctor who had the military help him get thru medical school. I SO wanted to go up to him and his little boy (or was it a girl) and shake his hand or something. but i'm bad at celebrity meetings, just ask anyone.  well, my midterm was...it was easy...for the people who studied hardcore for it that is. i wasn't one of them so some parts were a little puzzling for me. anyhow, i better go. I've got bills to do before i go to bed. until next time...

       Hiatus   hey there!!! i know i haven't made any entries into my blog but for some reason last week, i felt a tad overwhelmed and was unable to sit in front of the computer for half an hour and go over my day.  so i'm gonna try to make an entry right now as i watch ALIAS. i'll try my hardest to write coherently as i wait in ernest for sidney bristow's next move.  so hey, what's up guys? guess what i did last sunday? i opened up my CPU and installed 128 MB of RAM into my system. I was gonna ask my cousin, or cile or markie to do it for me because i felt terrified at the thought of opening up my computer. but everyone's like, "it's easy just open up the cpu and stick it in there!" sounded easy enough. so i braved my fear and installed the darn thing. to be honest with you i don't see the change in speed on my computer. THAT i'm still trying to figure out.   ok, i need to finish ALIAS because i have an accounting midterm to study for. fortunately, unlike studying in college, i actually READ the chapter long before the night before the exam. what a concept, reading assignments done when they're assigned. good deal...i'll let you know how it goes...wish me luck! iya doesn't need luck. i think she's gotten a perfect score on all 7 of our quizzes. what a smart bizzatch!   Speaking of which, IT'S IYA'S BIRTHDAY TOMORROW, MONDAY, NOVEMBER 10. Greet her if you get a chance!  FELIZ CUMPLEANOS IYA!!

       Juxtaposition   if you've ever taken any kind of english class, this term may sound familiar to you. if not, then it might as well be written in sanscrit cuz it's not a word you hear everyday. but in literary terms, JUXTAPOSITION occurs when a sad or terrible occurrence in a story is immediately followed by a moment of happiness or comic relief, and vice versa.  well, this word couldn't have been more applicable to my life than this very moment. on friday, halloween was a great day. granted the weather was dreary and i would've enjoyed lying in bed more than anything, the work day seemed to rush thru and at the end of my 8 hours i was ready to go out and celebrate. donned in my angel wings and halo, we started the evening with a trip to the mall for my 6-month old nephew, kelsoe's 1st halloween. he was dressed up as tigger and although the rain outside was pounding down on the streets, the smile on his face was enough to brighten my day. he observed in delight at all the little kids (and adults) dressed in their costumes. he had fun trying to snatch on to my wings (to eat) and even more fun attempting to grab my sister's fairy wand (again, to eat). as usual he didn't cry very much, not even in his tigger outfit, and at the end of the trip to the mall, he was as happy as could be.  i spent the rest of the evening at el cid dancing and drinking with iya the bee, matt aka eminem, rochelle the inflateable pumpkin, rachele the fairy, riann the german beer girl, joe as a "badass mutherf**cker," tommy the delta boy soldier straight out of blackhawk down, randy as alvin from the chipmunks, eric the pirate, pocahontas cile and father edwin. the last few moments of the night at denny's were filled with laughter and almost a crime cuz i walked out with the money and the bill in my hand!   l spent saturday doing laundry and then celebrating ate tin's 27th birthday. we tried our hardest to forget we were freezing, attempting at all costs to keep reminding ourselves that the party was a luau theme. as soon as you start grabbing your stomach due to laughter, suddenly you forget it's 65 degrees outside and you're wearing a hawaiian shirt or sarong. we got to watch cile's hawaii video presentation, complete with slideshow and credits. you wanna know how talented this girl is? watch one of her videos.  any evening spent in the company of great people is always perfection, as this weekend proved. but today, it's hard to put into words how quickly all that perfection can disappear. two people very close to me, whom i love dearly, are moving away and i can't do anything to prevent it. i've been crying all day because i feel sad and helpless and i can't tell you how big a part of me is dying because i don't know when i'll see them again. i think they've left already, but haven't even come to say good-bye yet. i'm not sure if it's better this way, since good-byes are always the worst. but i just wanted to hold them both, just to let them know i loved and will miss them. but the best i can do is hope that they're kept safe always.  this is why i'm always so cautious with happiness. cuz there's always something waiting behind the wings to take it away...

       What 2003 Has Meant To Me...   By the time I finish this entry there will be about 6 hours left before the new year, 2004. Geez, every time I've attempted to finish a complete thought and type up an entry about the year I get distracted somehow (by fatigue or laziness, familial duties, or friends who call to ask what the big deal is about Lord of the Rings...by the way Cheryl, it's GANDALF, not RANDOLF...ha ha ha...THAT KILLS ME!!). Anyhow, before the rest of my family starts pouring in to ring in the new year, I've managed to steal a few moments to myself to do some pondering.  What did I get out of 2003? I'll tell you what I DIDN'T get...more money. I tell you, as much as I deny it, I can be an awful spender. In fact, my new year's resolution for 2004 is not to lose weight (it's a losing battle i need to figure out a more effective strategy to), but to take heed of my excessive spending. I'm reminded sporadically by mom and dad that Tin's high school tuition will not be met by only them, but by me as well. Hence, therefore, thus, my new digital video cam will have to wait. I'm DETERMINED to pay off at least one of my major credit cards this year. Small steps...  So what did I LEARN from 2003? I think the most significant lesson I've been taught this year is letting go. From January to especially this month, I've had to learn to let go of people, bad experiences, feelings and weaknesses. I know I've set a lot of limits on myself, especially the amount of emotion I choose to reveal. A retreat I attended at the beginning of the year helped me realize how much I had been holding in and how important it was that I let go. It's still a hardship I carry but I've learned to deal with it better, although there is much to work on.  I've learned a lot about letting go from people around me. Break-ups have been prevalent these last couple of years. And when they occur between friends, it's not only hard on the people who have undergone the break-up, but also difficult for the friends who have come to witness and become accustomed to that relationship. It's hard to see those close to you suffer so mercilessly at their loss. You sit there and listen to them cry and talk for hours over how it went wrong. You feel helpless and wish it had never happened. But then you see or talk to them after awhile, and you suddenly look at them differently. Perhaps they're not the same person they were and maybe they're still feeling sad or confused inside. But you realize that as hard as it is for them to let go, they will eventually and completely loosen their grip on that one part of their lives in order to hold on to another venture no matter who or what it is. Letting go of one thing only allows you to embrace another.  Letting go of people...Jhoette came here to visit for 3 months after having been gone a year. We cherished every minute we got to spend with him. He came in March and in a blink of an eye, it was May and he had to head back to the Philippines. A week later, Carlo followed him. One can only be so lucky to find such friends as Jhoette and Carlo. To say good-bye is the worst thing to have to say, even if it's not forever (at least we hope). We cry not only because we hate to see them go, but we worry for their safety and livelihood. In the end, we know they've departed to follow a dream or to escape a reality and I can only sing words of praise for their courage to do so...My beloved nephew and his parents have moved about 6-7 hours away. Their departure, although well-intended, has brought many of us to bitter sadness and longing. We missed the baby's first Christmas and first entrance into the new year and I can hardly decribe the emptiness that hangs like fog over this family because of this. But I know there are reasons beyond my help and understanding of why this is happening. I just pray that no matter what, my nephew's best interest is at hand always...My grandfather, Papang, who would've celebrated his 80th birthday today, has passed on and the only light I'm forced to see in these few weeks of darkness is that he is no longer suffering. He has been the hardest thing for me to let go of because he's really gone. When I visit the Philippines next he won't be there and it's something I have yet to accept.  Weaknesses....GET BEHIND ME SATAN! Unhealthy being that I've managed to become this year, giving up on things I love must be put under control or I'll kill myself. This year I resolve to take control of my life by putting the unhealthiest of aspects at bay. Healthy eating and regular excercise is a must so as to attain my rightful shape (inside and out). Most important goal this year? Cut back on superfluous spending. If not, my ulcer will surely burst everytime I sit down to do bills.  So that's me in 2003. I wish everyone a wonderful New Year's Eve and pray that 2004 will treat you better if this year didn't. If 2003 was excellent to you, then I hope 2004 is just as kind if not kinder. GOD BLESS!!

       As the Jingle Bells Fade...   Here we are, no more than 2 days before the end of another year. We can use up all the colloquialisms we can think of related to the passage of time ("Oh how times flies...Like sands through the hour glass"...you know what I mean), but I don't think we can ever really explain time's expedience. Where DOES all that time go? For a second I was a 5 year old child being pulled on a wagon by my classmate; then a new big sister at 12 years old; all of a sudden I'm a college graduate and NOW, all my friends and cousins are getting engaged or getting married! aaaaaahhh...are we there?...  ...random...cheryl and i are on the phone right now talking about dvd's and our fetish for them. we both agree that it has reached an out of control level. When you're holding a dvd in your hand at Best Buy and you can't figure out if you've already bought it, then you know you've made it to the point of no return. ha ha ha...i'm tired, time for bed...

       Getting to know...    MELISSA MARIE DAWA aka ISA or ISE    Vitals:  I met Isa in Terry's dorm our freshman year at UCI. But it wasn't until we had to share the physical and emotional load of PCN coordinatorships that we realized our compatibility = 7 years and counting  Role in my Life:  Sympathetic Confidante - For some reason, Isa always seems to know exactly how I'm feeling and why before I can utter one word or channel any inkling of emotion. Some people search endlessly for the right words to say to those who need assurance. Fortunately for me and anyone who knows her, giving comfort is Isa's forte.    Good Times:  Isa used to walk into our apartment, pillow and blanket under her right arm, backpack hanging from her left shoulder, talking on her cellphone for about 10-15 minutes. When she's done, THEN she says HELLO. Oh yeah, she didn't live with us, but she might as well have. She slept at our place at least 3-4 times a week.  In her own words:  “I don't really like her." (Who Ise?) "Jessica SAMPSON."

       Playing Catch Up...   That's what I'm gonna do right now. I seriously haven't checked my e-mail since the afternoon of December 24! Suffice it to say, I've been occupied even moreso since then, driving to and from places, greeting people, blah blah blah...So here is my meager attempt...     When Reality Strikes, It Strikes Hard...     My mom came home from the Philippines on tuesday night, December 23rd armed with the typical balikbayan box filled with goodies for everyone. For a split second I forgot what she went back there for in the first place cuz she brought so much stuff with her; underwear (SO-EN baby!), polvoron, bags, bracelets and necklaces from my uncles, aunts, cousins and lolas. I was more than overwhelmed and extremely grateful. My aunts, uncles and cousins found the time and money to send us christmas gifts at such a fragile time and I was just so touched. One of my cousins wrote me a heartfelt letter saying he wishes my sister and I were there with them, and after looking through the pictures my mom came home with, I was indeed filled with tears at the realization that my grandfather had died and I wasn't there to bury him with the rest of my family. A pang of guilt still resides within and it's something I'm afraid I will carry with me for a very long time.   It was about a week after my mom had left when it really dawned on me what had happened. In the midst of trying to get everything done, in the middle of doing what my mom was supposed to do, I lost myself. The news of my grandfather's death had come so suddenly and we had to act to quickly to get my mom home that I didn't give myself anytime to mourn. It had been a week since we found out. I was sitting at my desk with phones ringing left and right, people asking me to do things and me trying to keep up when I caught myself in a state of vertigo...I just got dizzy. So I ran to the bathroom and cried for 20 minutes. It had finally hit me; your grandfather's gone, Anna, and you're sitting in your office trying to enter 80 financial contracts into the computer. It made me hate everything and everyone around me and I was so ready to walk into my boss's office, yell I QUIT and storm out.   I hadn't felt so angry and so overwhelmed and so alone in so long. I just wanted to scream TO HELL WITH EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING! But you all know me, I'd never do that. So for the rest of the day I sulked. The crying, although cleansing, didn't feel thorough enough, so I figured I had to wait until the next breakdown to feel better. But then came Monday...    Kind Words...    Monday, December 22, I read an e-mail from a good friend who sounded like she needed someone to talk to so I called her right after work. We talked about her dilemma for awhile and then she asked, "Anna, how are YOU?" And for some reason I felt better, maybe because it sounded like she really meant it, like she really didn't mind taking time from her day to see if I was okay. She listened to me intently for half an hour and it was then that something inside felt better. I told her everything I was feeling and she didn't just grunt blank "uh huh's." I knew she cared and after that I actually began to take some time to deal with things happening around me. Thanks Isa!

He always seems to see the brighter side of life’s inconsistencies and I wish someday soon I can be the same.  Good Times:  Driving to and from Charlotte, NC to UNC Chapel Hill in the middle of a snowstorm talking about anything and everything.  In his own words:  “Everyone keeps asking me if I’m nervous about proposing. I guess I would be…if I just didn’t love her so much.” (on his new fiancé Stephanie)

Good Times:  Back in 2000, we went to Vegas with the family but Ben wasn't 21 yet. So we greased the 21 & over wristband his older brother was wearing so HE could wear it, just so we could walk around the casino and play slots until 3 am.  In his own words:  (To be spoken in a female, Filipino tone of voice like his mom's. I ALWAYS fall for this when he calls!) "Hello Leng! Kamusta ka na. Dis is Auntie Grace."

       Gratitude   I just want to thank everyone who has sent their condolences to me and my family. I can't tell you how much all of your comforting words and prayers have meant to us, especially me. My mom left for the Philippines the very same evening we found out about my grandfather's death and I've spoken to her a few times already. She sounds a little out of sorts still but I know she's dealing with it the best way that she can.   Thank you so much all of you! Our loss would have been far more difficult to deal with if not for your support. God Bless you all!

       This Christmas...   It's 10:45 am right now and I'm at home, not sick...not ditching...just mourning. My grandfather in the Philippines passed away today. It's only been 2 hours since I found out and it's felt like 2 days. I got a text from my uncle as we were getting ready to head for the office: "Leng, Iniwan na tayo ni Papang"..."Papang has left us." I haven't been put in this position in a while and crying, you would think, would be the first thing I'd want to do, but I just went numb. After telling my mom to call the Philippines all the fear I had been anticipating since we last saw my grandfather had come crashing through. He was gone.  The last time I saw Papang was in August of 2001 when my family and I went home to the Philippines for 2 weeks. I hadn't seen him since I was four so our meeting, suffice it to say, was daunting. He looked so different since I left him 19 years ago, thinner, older, weaker. It was hard to imagine the airforce colonel I left in 1982. When I was a little girl I used to love when he came home from being away on duty. I vaguely remember him in his khaki uniform coming up the stairs after months in Davao or Tawi-Tawi, ready to talk to his then only granddaughter. And then I left for the states and suddenly he became someone we would call every so often to greet HAPPY BIRTHDAY or MERRY CHRISTMAS. And as the years went on, so did his health.   Eversince we got back here from our vacation there I've been dreading every phonecall from back home. Knowing that in his condition, his departure from our lives was forthcoming. And now it's happened and more than ever I just want to sit and talk to him, tell him that as far away as we had moved, and as long as we had been gone, I had never forgotten him. The only comfort I'm finding in all this sadness is that Papang is no longer suffering. As cliche was it sounds, I know in my heart he's much stronger, much better and in a more glorious place than anywhere his earthly life had ever taken him. I just wish I could have said Good-Bye and I love you...

       Distance   It's 1:15 am and I was SO ready to hop into bed 45 minutes ago, but I saw Jhoette online and I just had to talk to him for a little bit. It was hardly a conversation to measure up to any of our famous all-nighters, but when a good friend is thousands of miles across the ocean, getting a 5-10 minute exchange of words means a whole lot. I miss having friends like Jhoette and Carlo around.  Friendships are very, how shall I put this...complex, as I've witnessed over and over again. There are times in a person's livelihood when friends are merely the social actors in one's theater of life; the role players designated for extracurricular activities outside of family. But as the years progress, as the production gets older, one starts to realize the value of key thespians in the play who do no less than give your story substance. Sooner or later the social role players not only exist to provide company in the face of frolic, but to offer support and strength in the face of criticism.   When you have found ONE dependable actor in your own productions of life, you couldn't be more blessed. I've been lucky to find quite a few and am saddened to also have lost a few. Finding friends is easy. It's keeping them that's the hard part.

       Have Faith   If you've spoken to me at all this week, you probably got to witness the dormant outrage that lives within me. I think I'm a relatively patient person, and as much as I can, I will stand back and let my fellow humans be the erroneous beings that they are (not that I'm excluding MYSELF from falibility) and say nothing. But hurt me or something close to me and it's SO over!  Everyone knows that my camera and I are like a couple. I LOVE MY CAMERA!! But I had to bring it in to Best Buy to get fixed because the shutter wasn't opening all the way. Glad that I had bought a warranty for free repairs and maintenance, I set out to the electronic superstore the week before thanksgiving, November 20 to make use of my $60. The invoice they gave me read: "SCHEDULED COMPLETION DATE: November 26. Too busy during thanksgiving weekend to pick it up, I decided to wait until Monday, December 1 to call in and let them know I was coming to pick up my camera. 1:15 pm, I call Best Buy and the customer service guy says that he can't find in the computer that the camera had arrived. Knowing that there might be delays, I say OK, and decided to call again the next day. "I'm sorry ma'am," the girl says, "But I don't see that your camera has been returned to us yet." A little upset, I tell her how long ago I dropped it off and that it was scheduled to be ready on November 26. She apologized, yada yada yada, and knowing that she has no control over this, I let it slide until Wednesday. I speak with another young lady who says that my camera may have been dropped off on november 20th, but it wasn't physically sent to the vendor until NOVEMBER 24TH!!! So here I am, ticked off as hell that they would send the camera to be fixed 2 days before the completion date they typed onto the invoice AND THEN she had the nerve to say, "well ma'am, the date is really just an estimate. It won't always be ready by then." THEN PUT ESTIMATED COMPLETION DATE DUMBASSES NOT SCHEDULED! And then she goes on to say that there is a UPS tracking # in the computer but she doesn't know if that's for an incoming or outgoing package. I reprimand her for a few minutes and midway into her, "Thank you for calling Best--" I banged the receiver onto the phone rest. I was too busy on thursday to deal with it so on Friday afternoon, I decided to go to Best Buy MYSELF and complain in person. The tech guy looks my invoice up in the computer, heads to the cabinets to look for my camera, talks to ANOTHER tech guy to help him understand what the computer is saying (TECH GUYS? really?) and then says, again, that the UPS tracking # doesn't indicate incoming or outgoing so he suggested I use their phone to call the customer service line. The guy puts me on hold for 10 minutes, then asked to talk to the tech guy, then advised that he would call the vendor the camera was sent to and by this time i am 5 minutes past my lunch and I still have to drive back to the office.  So I give the guy on the phone my number at work and storm out of Best Buy ready to slap the first person I see wearing a royal blue shirt and khakis. I get to work and I have a voicemail message from the customer service guy I spoke with 10 minutes earlier and he says that the vendor is already closed so maybe I should call them on Monday to check the status of my camera. AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!!!! For the rest of my workday that afternoon I was speechless and spent.  So I head to the 5:30 mass at Holy Family Church and Father Maurice's homily was all about having faith; having faith that bad things will happen, having faith that they happen for a reason, and having faith that they will be resolved in due time if we just let it go and let what's supposed to happen, happen without getting so upset at everything that comes to us thereafter. After I got home that evening from a rockin' JC Chasez concert at the House of Blues (more details to come), I went to bed and laid everything that happened this week to rest. My camera was somewhere and worst case scenario, they lost it and will replace it. I personally couldn't do anything about the situation but complain and be upset and I was so sick of being that way that I decided to let it be and have faith that it would be okay in the end. All I was sad about was the fact that I wouldn't have it for a christmas party saturday night. Oh well, I said. It's cool.  I was eating breakfast the next morning, Saturday and my grandfather comes in and hands me this thing wrapped in foam paper and bubble packaging. "Here, this was put into our mailbox by mistake yesterday." It was my camera. My first reaction was, "HELLO! Does Best Buy really not know the procedures involved with situations like this?" Then I realized I had my dear digicam in my hand and I shut my mouth. It didn't matter anymore.   Moral of the story: Overreacting will get you nothing but unnecessary anxiety and agitation, which never helps in any situation. Sometimes you just have to have faith that things will be okay in the end. Life is so much calmer when I'm not angry and annoyed. Faith; I'd forgotten all about it.

       "But hey, that's what we do."   This is something that someone I know will say to me every single time he'd like to make a comment and not be chastised for it. Joe-freakin'-Carlos, this one's for you. HAPPY HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!! I tried to get Hillary Duff to do a special performance for when Joe got home from work today, but apparently she's on tour. Next year we'll try again...

       Getting to know...     CHRISTINE P. LLAMAS aka ATE    Vitals:  Met in 1982 when I was in kindergarten and she was a 2nd grader at St. Francis; went to the same high school and same college, roommate for 1year = 20 years and counting   Role in my Life:  Big Sister I Never Had – Ate knows me inside out. We can practically read each other's minds and she’s probably my #1 supporter. But when it's time to set me straight, she makes it known in the gentlest way possible.     Good Times:  Ditching class and driving to Big Bear at 5:30 am at an attempt to see *NSYNC at MTV’s Snowed-In. She got some airtime but, sadly, the boys weren’t scheduled to appear until the next day.  In her own words:  “My tears are crying" (drunk Tin-Tin)    If Procrastination Were a Major...   I'd graduate Magna Cum Laude. This whole weekend, from the Wednesday before Thanksgiving to Sunday night, I've been occupied in the head thinking of all the things I know I have to get done. I have to finish my accounting homework, I have to study for my quiz on Tuesday night, I have to finish my accounting project, etc. So with all these things in mind, I came home last night, ready to get to business, picturing the joy and relief I will feel when I finish that project days before it's due. So after a wholeday affair of family bonding, I walk upstairs...and cleaned the bathroom, then proceeded to organize my giftwrapping bin. Oh, I finished my homework...at like 11:35 pm! I came home at 8! Terrible! And I was all reprimanding my sister last night for lagging on her high school application to my dear alma mater! I should be one to talk. Well, I just don't want her to end up like me that's all. =)  So after work today, I PROMISED myself that I was going to do everything I planned. But 'lo and behold, what awaited me on the coffee table? A box from the Disney catalog and what was inside? The PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN dvd!!!!!!!!! It isn't even released until tomorrow but Ate (featured in this week's GETTING TO KNOW YOU series) pre-ordered it for me as a Christmas gift! YOU'RE AWESOME ATE THANKS!!! So you can imagine how the wheels in my head began to turn in another direction as my plans to study begin to vaporize...again. Well, I haven't done any studying yet, but it's because my nephew was here for an hour to visit so I had a good excuse.  However, I refuse to give in to the procrastination any longer so I'll go and work on that project and study for that quiz. Besides, I have to get up early tomorrow because I'm making up time for a 90 minute lunch to go to my sister's parent-teacher conference. My dad can't get out of work and my mom, well, she can't drive so they've asked me to go. Interesting...we'll see what happens. Until next time....

       When God Closes a Door...   ...some way He opens a window. That is one of my favorite lines from my favorite movie ever,  THE SOUND OF MUSIC . I think about inpirational words such as these and am often struck with doubt when pessimism has clearly taken me over. Window? What window? Show me where so I can tell you if it's a valid window or not. Does it look over blue waters or camel colored fields? Or is it blocked by a brick wall? Answers, I always look for answers. If you've read my entry about faith, you'll know how easily I've lost trust in ever finding that window that I know God has opened up somewhere. WHERE IS IT HIDDEN LORD?   Content, kind, friendly, outgoing, ambitious, intuitive, optimistic...These used to be words I'd use to describe myself on a job application. Now I'm looking at terms like bitter, angry, unhappy and fed-up to fill in the lines. What happened to me? I'm chatting with Cile online right now and, bless her heart, she's saying all that she can to release me from that awful cage of self-pity and self-loathing that I seem to be trapped in. I'm afraid I'm gonna be here forever! Is there help for hopeless people such as myself?

       SHE SHOOTS...SHE SCORES!!!!   My sister is the captain of the varsity basketball team at St. Francis and this past Saturday, my parents and I watched her play the first game of the season. We've watched their team play before and well, they're not pros that's for sure. They appear rattled and out of sync with each other a lot of the time. And this past weekend, when the score at half-time read 24-4 (they were 4), we were sure this game would end depressingly. However, there came a glimmer of hope after the opposing team scored 12 un-answered points. Tin's friend Lissette scored 4 minutes into the second half (they play two 20-minute halves) it seemed as if a fire had been lit right under them. One of the girls from the other team shot one into THEIR basket making it 36-8 and then the game for our Lady Knights really began. My sister had hooked it in for 2 more points, then followed it with a 3-pointer from her best friend Josie. Then they caught up until it was 36-23. They lost 38-23 but it was okay. They played their hearts out those last 15 minutes and our whole side was cheering until the buzzer sounded.   I know some of you think I like to punk Tin a lot, but you also know how amazed I am by her all the time. And that night, I was as ecstatic as ever that someone got a taste of her skills as a baller. Tin's a bit of an artist and she can be really quiet, but she's a jock, make no mistake about that. She had scored 11 points by the end of the night and couldn't be more excited at their performance as a team. Maybe next time the fire'll be lit right at tip-off, but for now, we'll revel that it was ever lit at all.

       Getting to know...      MARISSA LINDA MAE IGNACIO MORELOS aka IYA    History:  Met August 1990 on the first day of 7th grade at St. Francis of Assisi School, then classmates for 4 years at Immaculate Heart High School = 14 years and counting   Role in my life:   The Shadow I’m Always Chasing - You got a taste of this fact if you've read my entry about the perfect score that Iya got on our accounting midterm. She is seriously one of the most intelligent and together people I know. As much as we make fun of her "assertiveness" and her passion to make things right in her own scary way, I know it's only because we're jealous of her ability to know what she wants and her determination to attain them. I've admired this girl since we met 14 years ago and I think I always will.  Good Times:  Stalking *NSYNC (one of her more unique hobbies). I’m talkin’ parking in front of the building where KIIS FM airs because we heard a rumor that they would be there, then following a suburban because we were SURE they were in there! (Done at the insistence of Ate Tin-Tin but still!). But my favorite moments with Iya will always be our innumerable conversations as we reminisce about our past, laugh and analyze our present and anticipate (and at times worried) about our futures =)  In her own words:  With both arms in the air - “WADE!!!!! WADE!!!!” (We stood outside the place where *NSYNC had their album release party for CELEBRITY when Iya spotted Wade Robson. She was YELLING and SCREAMING as he stood there...5 FEET AWAY FROM HER!)

And I wonder why I don't have a new job yet...It's because i still have to do my second application of the crest white strips thingy for half an hour.   Oh, thanks for spending lunch with me iya! I HAD TONS OF FUN! ...although, a root canal would be more fun than sitting in my desk all day answering assonine questions asked by people who obviously shouldn't be in the business that they're in!...breathe anna...

       Baby I'm Yours   C'mon! Who knows this song by Shai? It's one of my favorite songs and to my delight, they showed the video on VH1 Soul when I got home from work today. The four guys are all chillin' and singin' a capella on the bleachers of Howard Univeristy. And guess who I realized is in that video? ANANDA LEWIS! Crazy! Anyhow, it's the ultimate sweet talk song. Just see for yourself (here comes another one of my lyric-based entries):   Baby I'm Yours  Understand girl that my heart is in your hands And I'm cautious  Of falling in love again So please don't hurt me, I'm scared Don't desert me, I'm afraid. Of being a fool, again  So Baby I'm yours, if you want me  And if you want my sweet love I'm yours If you need me Loving you forever, if you want me  Give me your love Baby I'm yours, if you need me  Realize girl that my faith is kind of torn So watch you step girl  Because my heart is weak and worn So won't you please be careful, I'm fragile I can't imagine the damage I have to handle  If you hurt me one more time, Please by mine  Baby, I've been through a whole lot of relationships, Whole lot of broken promises, But now I'm ready for a real one sweet heart Yes I am You don't have to worry baby. Don't you every go away.   What a great, "Girl, I've got a broken heart to mend and I think you could help me" kind of song! What sap of a woman wouldn't tend to this pitiful plea?..especially if he looked like Garfield from Shai. He used to date Coco (the lead singer) from SWV. Okay, enough because if you get me started on these 90's R & B love songs I could go on forever about junior high and high school. So that's all...

       Cake Nazis   Has anyone seen that episode of Seinfeld with the soup nazis? Ok maybe I'm exaggerrating just a tad, but if you've ever been to the famous OH-MY-GOD-YOU-LIVE-IN-GLENDALE-DO-YOU-GO-TO-THAT-CUBAN-BAKERY Porto's, you'd know exactly what I'm talking about.   There is a bakery on Brand Blvd here in Glendale that started out as this modest little family-owned business (go to www.portosbakery.com for more details). Seriously, the place was the size of my room! Then they kept having to expand cuz EVERYBODY AND THEIR DOG WANTED SOME DAMN CHEESEROLLS! Please don't get me wrong because I think it's an awesome bakery! When you taste the light and sweet cheeserolls, or the delectible triple chocolate mousse cake topped with ruffles of white chocolate, or the tasty fruit tart that no one can seem to get tired of, or my new discovery, the tres leches cake whose bottom is drenched in condensed milk, I suppose you'd brave the long wait just to order. Yes, there are that many different pastries you will definitely not taste at any other bakery. But it's the fanatacism of it that scares me.  It's insane here THE WHOLE TIME it's open. And people from all over the nation know about this place! You know, my parents handcarried 100 cheeserolls to our family reunion in Chicago at the request of my aunts and uncles? IT'S CRAZY! On saturday afternoon I pulled out a number from one of those number machine thingies at the bakery: #419. The ticker on the wall said: "Now serving 330!" THERE WERE 89 PEOPLE AHEAD OF ME! So I stood there, getting bumped into and pushed aside and ALL I WANTED WERE 3 DOZEN CHEESEROLLS...and joe's freakin' guava cheese roll (styupid!).   Leia is always asking me, "When are you gonna take me to that Cuban bakery?" and I would love to take her there one day, but as fate would have it, we never have the time to pass by when she's at my house. It's not like you can just go in and be out in 15 minutes.  With Porto's that's unheard of, unless you're planning to make a run for the kitchen, stuff your face then head for the backdoor.   Uy ve, talk about taking advantage of the sweet tooth...

       Getting to know...     RANDY MENDOZA aka RRRRANDY    Vitals:  Met when we were in kindergarten. He was in the morning class and I was in the afternoon class = 20 years and counting  Role in my Life:  The One Who’ll Never Go Away (at least I hope not) – Randy has been there for me since forever, the first guy I ever really considered a close friend. He was the one in the 5th grade who kinda rolled his eyes when I was being pathetic about some boy who didn’t like me back. But he’s the very same friend who’ll sit there and listen to me cry about it. Seldom getting the opportunity to talk or hang out for 4 years of high school, Randy and I are always able to pick up where we left off.  Good Times:  Where to begin…When we were in the 7th grade, Randy and I decided to run for student council president. At the time, the candidate with the most votes would be president and the runner-up would be vice president. Randy had told me before we started campaigning that he wanted to be VP, so he passed out flyers that said “RANDY MENDOZA for PRESIDENT” while telling each student, “Hey vote for Anna okay.”   In his own words:  “I like to eat.”

       The King Has Returned! (Did he ever!)   This past friday night I watched THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE RETURN OF THE KING for the THIRD time since it's release. Well, I saw the FELLOWSHIP once, and the TWO TOWERS twice, so I only saw it fit to see RETURN OF THE KING three times!...yup, there's no logic in that whatsoever, but I couldn't help it. No but serously, my main purpose on friday WAS to accompany those (Iya, Joe and Randy) who had not the pleasure of viewing the excellent film yet. I loved how Iya would tap me every other scene if she had a question! One time during the movie we moved in at the same time and bumped heads! But I digress...  The first time I saw FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, I thought it was a scary movie. I jumped a couple times during the film (when Bilbo's face turns monstrous when he asks Frodo to give him the ring at Rivendell and when Galadriel becomes this creepy, evil ghost lady when the fellowship was in Lorien). But then I saw it a second time in the comfort of my own living room and I was suddenly inspired (not only by Orlando Bloom), but by the story itself. By the time THE TWO TOWERS had been released, I had become a fan. I read all three books (save for the HOBBIT, which is my next venture) and waited anxiously for the third installment of Tolkien's masterpiece.   So I've sat in the theater for 3 hours and 21 minutes (THREE TIMES) for RETURN OF THE KING and each time I was nothing short of enthralled at this epic on the big screen before me. The film is so powerful, with its battle scenes, and at times so heartwrenching that you forget it's a fantasy (or is it?). Even though I had read the books and I knew what scenes were to follow, I was scared for Frodo & Sam with that evil and conniving Gollum hanging on them; I was proud of Pippin and Merry, who although had thought they were too little to fight for themselves, much less all of Middle Earth, showed themselves to be worth of the greatest honor one can bestow on such courageous beings; I saw the fear and doubt in Gandalf, who everyone depends on for guidance; I was anxious for Aragorn to apply that courage and fearlessness to the regal future before him and rescue his beloved Arwen from a deadly fate she chose in order to be with him; I marveled at Gimli and Legolas, who through their devotion to the Aragorn and the fellowship, managed to thwart their disdain in order to form a friendship between the unlikeliest of peoples in Middle Earth; I saw Faramir & Eowyn, who (I might be killing this for someone who hasn't read the book) I couldn't be happier, formed a most perfect union symbolizing the bond between Rohan and Gondor.  Am I reading too into it? Maybe. Kinda proves the kind of genius J.R.R. Tolkien was though, doesn't it, to move his readers in the way that he has. And the genius of Peter Jackson and his team to aid our visual needs. I can't wait for the dvd...and moreover...THE EXTENDED VERSION! I predict THAT's gonna be at least 4 1/2 hours long at the very least...with this I say BRING ON THE POPCORN!

       SCAREDY CAT   Has anyone watched THE RING? Well, if any of you know me, you’re well-aware that I don’t fare well when it comes to scary movies. I’m downright terrified of it all. It’s because I have such an active imagination! Anyhow, so this movie came out last year and everyone was trying to get me to watch. “HELL NO, YEAH RIGHT” was always my answer, I just couldn’t do it! Well, HBO was showing THE RING all weekend last week and I said to myself, “Suck it up Anna it’s just a movie.” So I ATTEMPTED to watch it Sunday morning…TOO BAD I CHANGE THE CHANNEL WHEN IT STARTS TO GET TOO SCARY FOR ME! I continued to force myself to watch the damn thing at least 3-4 more times that day and I got as far as when she fell in the hole (am I killing this for some people? I’m probably the only one who hasn’t finished watching it!), when she lifted up her arm from the water and their was all this hair on it, I screamed and ran to the kitchen.  I called my cousin that night and had her fill in all the holes since I changed the channel like 10 times! And hmm, maybe now that I know what happens, I can sit and watch it for real…NEGATIVE!

       Getting to know...     MATTHEW B. MINDANAO aka MATT or ACHUBOY    Vitals:  Matt was my first friend when I moved here from the Philippines in 1982 but of course we’ve been cousins since birth = 25 years and counting  Role in my life:  Brother I Never Had – Matt and I are the same age (we were born 6 months apart), we started school together, we used to fight over stupid toys when we were little, we keep each other company at family parties, etc. We don’t ever get mushy about it, but there hasn’t been much that’s happened in my life that Matt hasn’t witnessed and I am damn grateful for him.  Good Times:  Too many to tell cuz we grew up together! But here are some highlights: When we were about 5 or 6 years old, we were singing along to one of Matt’s Disney sing-a-long tapes and he decides to stick a marshmallow up his nose!…and of course it gets stuck. He cries cuz he can’t seem to blow it out until his mom comes to the rescue. A week later, he gets a piece of rolled up paper stuck up his nose!…Around the same age, Matt and I were playing hide-n-seek and I hid in a closet that doesn’t open from the inside. When I realized this, I was crying “Matt open the door!!” and he was standing there in front of the closet yelling, “Leng come out!!!” and we went back and forth like this until my dad finally came to my aid.  In his own words:  “Please man! Get this dog off me! Please! Edwin, Carlo, Dino! Get this dog off me! C’mon, it’s gonna give me nightmares!” (Matt hallucinating after too many beers)

       Killing Me Softly   There’s a song that Kelly Clarkson sings on the  Love Actually  soundtrack (that’s also in her album) that I adore because I think everything about it is so true. See for youself:   The Trouble With Love Is…    Love can be a many splendor thing Can’t deny the joy it brings A dozen roses, diamond rings Dreams for sale and fairy tales It’ll make you hear a symphony And you just want the world to see But like a drug that makes you blind It’ll fool you every time  The trouble with love is It can tear you up inside Make your heart believe a lie It’s stronger than your pride The trouble with love is It doesn’t care how fast you fall And you can’t refuse the call See you got no say at all  Now I was once a fool it’s true I played the game by all the rules But now my world’s a deeper blue I’m sadder but I’m wiser too I swore I’d never love again Swore my heart would never mend Said love wasn’t worth the pain But then I hear it call my name  Every time I turn around I think I’ve got it all figured out My heart keeps callin’ And I keep on fallin’ Over and over again Yes that story always ends the same Me, standin’ in the pourin’ rain Seems no matter what I do It tears my heart in two   Again, I am no expert when it comes to relationships seeing as to how I’ve never been in one (falling-in-love type of unions anyhow). But the few times I “experienced” romantic feelings, they’ve ended up emotionally disastrous…for ME. Maybe because I bottled up the emotions, fearing the worst should the boy find out how I felt. I've also tried revealing such feelings since hiding it didn't help the last time. I took one of Iya's favorite quotes to heart in forming this decision. It goes, "What's worse, saying something and wishing you hadn't or saying nothing and wishing you had?"  So I said something, but of course the end result sucked as badly as the one before when I kept my mouth shut. One of those damned if you do, damned if you don’t kind of things, that love. And then another time, I actually thought I had CONTROL over my feelings, that I could contain them if I so chose to (I'm a control freak). But of course, I couldn't contain the feelings effectively and I imploded every once in a while because there was no other outlet for the grief. Eventually the feelings wore itself out, but it took a long while.   Unrequitted love is one of the worst feelings I have ever felt (and I've felt it more than once). I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. It's a lingering, entrapping feeling. You own this strong emotion for someone (not that you wouldn't gladly give it away). Should you tell them? Would they reject you? Maybe. Could they return the feeling? Who knows. Are you afraid that you'll get the crappy end of the deal? Definitely. When all is said and done (or in most of my cases, nothing said and nothing done), you're still left with this longing that you can't get rid of and this is what seems to hurt you the most. And then the most horrifying thought sets in: How long is this terrible feeling gonna last? They say the love that lasts the longest is the love that is never returned. As a successful alumnus of this experience, I say, AMEN to that!

       Getting to know...      RIANN GRACE REYES aka MY NUISANCE    Vitals:  Riann was a wee little gal when we met. She lived one door away from my grandparents, which is MY house now. My room used to be HER room = about 12 years and counting  Role in my Life:  Active Listener - Sometimes when you're divulging your deepest emotions to people, you can tell they're just nodding their heads to appear as though they're listening when they're not. Riann is one of the sincerest listeners I know. Most of the time, she's the one encouraging ME to talk, and it's not because she's bored. It's because she wants to help.  Good Times:  Turbo Kickboxing at 24-hour fitness (or any day we decide not be lazy asses and work out) is always a party when I'm with this girl. We know when to encourage each other on the stairclimber and when to say, "more sit-ups?...nah."  In her own words:  " Ate Lengy, it's okay to feel."

       DANCIN’ DIRTY   Is it dumb that I wanna watch DIRTY DANCING: HAVANA NIGHTS? At first I thought, geez what a corny ass idea. But I caught the tail-end of the MTV special on it this morning and I was like, oooh dope soundtrack and excellent dancing! I love watching movies that have all this dancing in it (i.e. CENTER STAGE, SAVE THE LAST DANCE, DIRTY DANCING, heck! BRING IT ON! etc). And doesn’t Diego Luna (I think that’s his name) look like the geek in CAN’T HARDLY WAIT? My cousin brought it up and man! He totally looks like the guy in the movie who was out to get Mike Dexter but ended up drunk himself. Ha ha ha…I’m laughing just thinking about it. Anyhow, I don’t know who’d wanna watch this with me. I’m thinking maybe Leia or Riann or Ate…Fantone? Anyone? My sister will probably be like, “Naaah.”  Anyhoo, every time I watch movies like this I always want go out and do something related to it. After CENTER STAGE I was determined to see a ballet. I discovered, however, that ballets aren’t that prevalent much around here. I would’ve settled for the NUTCRACKER because I’ve actually been wanting to watch that, but as usual, funds are scarce during the holiday season so that plan was a negatory. After SAVE THE LAST DANCE, I SO wanted to go clubbin’! After I watched BRING IT ON, I broke out with our old cheerleading video. Yes sir, if you didn’t know already, I was a cheerleader in high school (one of the co-captains during my senior year, thank you very much!).   Anyhoo, DIRTY DANCING – HAVANA NIGHTS…any takers?

       Defeating the Purpose   I was so proud of myself today. I didn't eat any rice (preparing myself for the Lenten season) AND I spent an hour at the gym. I sweat...sweated (is this even a word?) on the nordic thingy AND I walked/jogged 3/4 of a mile on the treadmill AND i worked out my arms AND managed to do some abwork right after. Fernand came to work out with me and he had quite an evening as well. After we left the gym, Fernand mentioned he hadn't eaten dinner yet and wanted to "eat something sensible."...So we ate at Del Taco!  Thanks for dinner, Fernand! You're an excellent work-our homie!

       RETURN OF THE K...ELSOE   That's right, my cousin, his wifey and their little boy, my nephew Kelsoe, flew in tonight from Union City. I gave my aunt and uncle directions to the Long Beach Airport (courtesy of mapquest and yahoo maps) cuz they had to fly JetBlue! Anyhoo, my poor aunt and uncle circled Lakewood Blvd for like 90 minutes looking for any sign of the airport, calling me a few times and I KNOW what you people are thinking, "Dammit Anna, you got some people lost AGAIN?" I just read to them what the stupid mapquest gave me so don't even think it!  Anyhoo, I'm excited to see Kelsoe so badly!!! He's like 9 months now! We haven't seen him since Thanksgiving and we missed his very first Christimas so I'm on pins and needles with excitement. I have to wait until tomorrow though, after class (Iya and I start managerial accounting tomorrow...eeks!)...boo...but I'm sure it'll be worth the wait. I can't tell you how much I miss this baby and his parents! It's been too long!  Ok, I've got some cd's to burn so until next time...I have some new pictures to the right for you to peruse...

       Getting to know...     LEIA BETH GERALI aka LEIA   ("That's LEE-yah.")  Vitals:  Met our sophomore year at UCI. I was a tinikling tapper and she was the big bad tinikling queen = 7 years and counting    Role in My Life:  Miss Down-to-do-Whateva - Leia is that friend who you can always call to hang out and do...sometimes nothing but talk or watch tv with. If I don't call her, she calls me and no matter how unplanned our day begins, we always end up relaxed and fully vented at the end of it. But not only is she an excellent person to hang out with, she's one of the greatest listeners and secretkeepers I know.  Good Times:  ANNA-LEIA DAYS - These are literally all-day quality times we have doing the same things (as I've noticed recently): Eating, watching a dvd or two, watching tv. riding in the car and talking smack about everything we thought was smack-talk worthy (But hey, THAT'S WHAT WE DO, right joemama?)   In her own words:  “For the life of God, can we please sit down and rest!?” (Leia whining in DC after a whole afternoon at the Natural History Museum)  I think she meant "For the LOVE of God."

       SINGLE AWARENESS DAY	   …that’s code name for Valentine’s Day to us single folks, and this past Saturday, February 14, 2004, we celebrated our 3rd annual celebration of this cursed holiday…I mean blessed – Blessed Holiday. =) Anyhow, this started in 2002 with just 5 “members”: Me, Randy, Iya, Leia and Tin-Tin (my then 11 year old sister, now 13, who I don’t think is even single. She says she is but I beg to differ). Anyhow, we just decided to have dinner at revolving sushi that night. Then last year, we decided to do it again, extending our membership to Ryan, Fantone, and Gwennie. We saw DAREDEVIL at a theater down the street from Revolving that night and just had a great time in each other’s company. Dinner and a movie? Sounds grrret right?  Well, that’s exactly what we planned on this past weekend to follow tradition. Joemama Carlos pimped it with Gwennie, Leia, Iya, Fantone and me as dates on Valentine’s Day. Wasn’t he the lucky dog? Dinner at Revolving Sushi was, of course, pleasing to the stomach while the company was pleasing to the spirit. And following this with 50 FIRST DATES was sheer perfection. Talk about appropo for the holiday! I couldn’t help but fall in love with Adam Sandler’s character, Henry, in this movie. The things he did for Drew Barrymore’s Lucy was nothing short of self-sacrificing and pure and simple loving. It was really touching.  After the movie, it was Coffee Bean for me, Joe, Iya and Fantone. We hung out for awhile for some fun conversation, which is all you really can do at coffee places.   This was truly one of the nicest Valentine’s days I’ve ever had. Granted I was Valentine-less in the formally-accepted sense of the word, I wouldn’t have had it any other way (unless of course Orlando Bloom happened to call and say how Kate Bosworth is nothing compared to ME!…but I live here in the real world where stuff like that happens NEVER). Anyhow, it was definitely the company that made the difference here. For the last three years, Valentine’s Day has become a day I actually look forward to because I had something to do and people to do it with. I spent Saturday evening with 5 friends who I LOVE LOVE LOVE being around. Never short of comical moments or the capacity for insightful conversation, it’s a real wonder why the 6 of us are still single! WE’RE SO AWESOME! Ha ha ha…no but seriously, I love my single brothers and sisters (Randy, Fernand, Marnelli, Fernie, Ryan, Andrew, Larnie, Jason – did I miss anyone? – Jhoette and Cahlo – we missed you all!) and my wish is that we all find love by next Valentine’s day, making our membership to the Single Awareness league zero!!

       BIRTHDAY WISHES COME TRUE   I was telling Iya last night how I got all teary-eyed during mass last friday, my birthday. This birthday has been a God-send, not because of presents or celebrations, but because it's been a reminder of how lucky I am. I think I expressed this earlier but I can't stress it enough, especially because I've been feeling so down since last year ended and this year began. I was thanking God so much for keeping me alive so long, for letting me have people such as yourselves calling, texting and e-mailing birthday greetings. Just when I think I've had it with this life, I'm always handed something so precious and so neglected by me, like these people I love being around.  Jhoette gets the prize for greeting me the earliest. He called on Thursday night. "Happy birthday Anna! I know it's not 'til tomorrow, but it's tomorrow here already!" And that made me so happy! That began this blessed weekend for me.  On Friday afternoon, Iya brought chinese food to the office and we had lunch in the breakroom. We had shrimp fried rice, beef broccoli, mongolian beef and chow mein. Mmmmmmm I love chinese food! It was so fun hanging out with someone during my lunch! Thanks again Iya!!  After mass with the parentals and my sister that evening, we went to my aunt's house. She bought Thai BBQ and we feasted!! (EAT! That's all I did this weekend!).  And then we played LORD OF THE RINGS MONOPOLY! HOW FUN IS THAT GAME!! I'm SO gonna buy it and I'm SO gonna invite you all to play with me! I love hanging out with my family, especially my cousins and my sister! We're so stupid when we're together!  Yesterday, we had lunch at Gordon Biersch, window-shopped around Pasadena, had some ice cream, talked at Coffee Bean, and then had dinner at Noodle World. I love walking around Pasadena on a Sunday afternoon, and to do it with such a fun group of people made the day even better. And for once it didn't rain on my birthday weekend!   I cherished every minute of this past week, especially this weekend. (Valentine's day was fun too, but more on that later). And can I just say how thoughtful everyone has been? I wish I could tell you about all the wonderful gifts I got for this birthday but it would take hours for me to give the thanks due. From mail order gifts (this was very big for people this year) to heartfelt greetings to having a meal or two to celebrate my special day, I am so thankful!   THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU everyone for making my 26th birthday so wonderful! I am blessed!

        Getting to know...      JHOETTE ARCHEIN M. DUMLAO aka JHOETTE    Vitals:  Met in the 7th grade way back in 1990, on the first day of school, me in my plaid skirt and white blouse and Jhoette in his PE UNIFORM!!! Did no one tell this boy he was only allowed to wear that on PE DAYS? = 14 years and counting  Role in My Life:  Apprehensive Healer - Jhoette used to tell me, "If you ever need someone to talk to or a shoulder to cry on...ask Iya, cuz I'm not good at that stuff." Jhoette says he feels helpless when we come crying to him because a boy broke our heart or we're feeling down about life. He underestimates his abilities as a comforter of the down and out. Sometimes he really didn't know what to say. But when I think of all the times he's made me or anyone feel better, it's never his fumbling words I remember, it's him holding my hand and letting the tears flow freely.   Good Times:  During our sophomore year at UCI, Jhoette pledged for a fraternity and, to make a long story short, some of us (ok fine, me and Iya) felt neglected and sore about having to deal with his absence in our lives. He crossed over after the fall quarter. On the eve of my 20th birthday, while I was studying for an econ midterm, Reyna ran up to our room and told me to hurry downstairs because someone came to greet me Happy Birthday. When I got to the living room, all up in my pajamas, Jhoette had brought 3 or 4 of his pledges to serenade me.    In his own words:  “Do as I say, not as I do.”

       All Up In My Birthday Suit!   Naked you say? No I'm not naked, but I am 26 today (in a few minutes)...Why do I cringe when I say that? I don't understand. Everyone around me (except of course you all who are undergoing the same life-altering changes), keeps saying things like, "oh you're still such a baby!" or "26? You've got such a long life ahead of you still!" I guess I'm just a little bit, how shall I say this? In denial. When am I never in denial of something right? But still, age has always been something I welcomed. In fact, when I was younger, like a teenager (EEKS I HAVEN'T BEEN A TEENAGER IN 7 YEARS!), I couldn't wait to be 22! I thought that at 22, I will have graduated from college, I'd have this great career, and I'd be engaged. Let's see, bachelor's degree? CHECK! Great career? WILL GET THERE...Engaged? BIG FAT NEGATORY...Hey look, a poem about this very subject. It's called:  ...Or Lack Thereof...  If I could tell you What I do Right to the very minute You'd yawn yourself  To the very death With the lack of life that's in it I wake up every morning With a chance To follow through With plans and dreams And hopes that seem Too big to come true I trudge right through The weary day Dragging step by step With tensions mounting  In my head For this life I can't accept I can't accept That this is all My destiny has to give What happened to The great career And the life I dreamt to live What happend to The fantasy Of the man they said would come The one who'd sweep me Off my feet --  Is that dream just for some What happened to The beautiful house I planned to sit and dwell Did someone come And tear it down Why, I just can't tell Please tell me That I'm dreaming That I have a fighting chance To have that home That great career And meet some sweet romance Tell me that This isn't all My future has in store Tell me this Is temporary Tell me this...or nothing more.  Yay! WAY TO BE OPTIMISTIC ON YOUR BIRTHDAY ANNA! But seriously, my point is that, I may complain about hating my job, or not having a boyfriend and not living like a rap star, but I am very grateful for having who and what I DO have in my life. At least I HAVE a job to support my needs and non-needs (a new j.crew hooded cardigan? bring it on!). I have a loving loving family who harbors nothing but pride and exemplary support for me. I have friends who I share immense amounts of grief and joy with. Amidst the complaining, in all the moments of great frustration and longing, the bottom line is, I am greatly blessed.   A good friend once told me, "Welcome everything that comes to you, but do not long for anything else." I think I may try to make that my mantra this year. Then by the time 27 comes around, maybe I'll be writing poems about trees and flowers instead of dilapidated aspirations. Anyhow, 10 minutes to midnight -- 26 here I come!

       WHEN I SAY SAKE, YOU SAY BOMB!    This weekend I went to Tokyo Delves to celebrate mine and Fantone’s birthdays…Fantone’s and my birthdays…Is there a correct way to say this? Anyhow, we got faded! So 18 of us met up at this place called Tokyo Delves. It’s a sushi bar…PLUS MORE! We had some sushi, danced a little, sake bombed to our hearts’ content and just had a grand ole’ time. And half a strawberry martini and 2 sake bombs into the evening, I even managed to do the BYE BYE BYE routine with the waiters (and the cute bartender who gave me a pretty Rated PG-13 lapdance).  Actually I was doing all kinds of routines that night. Drunk Anna only comes out once in a blue moon so I had lots of fun.   After Tokyo Delves, Fantone and I opened presents outside (like on the sidewalk) and took pictures (why do Asians love taking pictures?). The gals got me the soundtracks to all the LORD OF RINGS movies, the Harry Potter films, Pirates of the Caribbean and the 1st season dvds of ER!!! I LOVE IT THANKS SO MUCH!! I also got a gift card to Best Buy from Annie and Will and a gift card to Borders from Jean & our little boy, Hayden (I spent some of it on some magazines already!). Fantone got a new dvd player and a shadow box-like frame for all her marathon medals (Girlfriend has run like 2 or 3 AND she’s doing the LA Marathon next March!) Then we headed to City Walk, met up with Jean and Paul and hung out at Saddle Ranch. Paul bought me a lemon drop shot (WHEEE DOGGIES) and Iya bought me my favorite drink ever, a Malibu and coke. After that I was like, okay, let’s drink some water! I was okay after a glass of water and 2 trips to the restroom so I watched Paul ride that bronco like a champ! And I had fun watching Cile drool over the “ring-master” who was running the WHO-CAN-RIDE-THIS-MECHANICAL-BULL-AFTER-CHUGGING-8 BEERS contest. She was literally following him around the “bullpen.” Iya and I were beside ourselves with laughter cuz she was being so silly. I haven’t seen her that smitten since…Lar…Tommy. I haven’t seen her that smitten since Tommy…ha ha ha…I’m just playing Cile and Tommy!  Anyhow, we headed to coffee bean for a few minutes after Saddle Ranch so the drunkards could sober up a bit before the drive home. THANKS FERNIE, JASON & IYA (and Jeff who drove and was KINDA sober) FOR BEING THE DESIGNATED DRIVERS! Especially Iya, who wasn’t the faded one for a change =). She followed me everywhere that night to make sure I didn’t do something dumb like talk to strange guys or hurl in the bushes (hee hee hee…drunk IYA is the BEST!). Until next time…I’ve got a story to tell ya’ll about the stupid nurse who came to do the yearly blood tests for our office for the wellness program crap. Ooowee!

        Getting to know...      CHRISTINE FANTONE aka FANTONE!!!    Vitals:  Met our sophomore year at UCI during PCN Choir practice (Yes, the PCN that lasted FOREVER but we had fun singing right?). We were both in the alto section = 6 years and counting  Role in My Life:  My Partner in Life’s Cesspool of Bitterness = Fantone and I can talk for hours an hours about everything (and everyone) we want but don’t have. We’re the literal equivalent to misery loving company. But at the end of every one of our conversations, we can’t help laughing at ourselves. Suddenly we don’t feel so bitter anymore.  Good Times:  When we had our 11-day east coast excursion back in December 2000, 6 of us took a train to Penn Station in New York City from DC. Fantone would be meeting us there after having taken a train from Buffalo, NY. The 6 of us got there at about 12:30 or 1 in the afternoon. We dropped off our stuff at the hostel then headed back to the train station to meet Fantone. We spoke with her aunt and uncle in Buffalo and they said that she had taken a different train because the station was snowed in for a while. So Cile, Ate Tin, Leia, Andrew, Ryan and I scoured Penn Station for the next 3-4 hours. We didn’t know what city or station she would be coming from, when she was scheduled to arrive, which platform she would be exiting from and to top it all off, Ryan’s cell phone battery (our ONLY cell phone during the trip) was dying so we couldn’t make any more calls to her aunt and uncle. We literally stationed ourselves at every platform exit, stairway, etc. If you’ve never been to New York City, they’re not big on benches or seats there so we sat on the floor by this newsstand like bums. Eventually she got there and the look on her face was of pure relief.  In her own words:  “Peace, Love and Tony Lucca.”

       WHY MUST IT COME TO THIS?   Yesterday I found out that my friend’s father passed away. He’d been suffering from cancer (prostate and then bone I believe) for a few years now and, again, although he’s no longer in pain, it’s sad to think that he had to die to attain such relief. I heard of his death at about 8:45 yesterday morning and it has been all I can think about until now. This is the 4th time since August I’ve heard about someone’s passing and I realize it’s not an announcement you can ever get used to hearing. First you think logically to yourself; someone has died, they’re no longer breathing, they’ve left their physical shells, etc. And then something hits home. That person was someone’s son or daughter, someone’s mother, grandfather, someone’s father, and as far as their life on earth goes, their run is basically done and there isn’t much we can do about keeping them from that finish line.   I’m not much of a crier (unlike Iya, who can LITERALLY cry at the drop of hat), but there are certain things my mind can merely glance at that would bring me to tears. Thinking about death is one of those things. As much as I’d like to say that it’s not the WHEN I’m afraid of, but the HOW, it depresses me to think about not being here to exchange gifts with my family or have coffee with my friends. Worse yet, not having a loved one here for me to spend time with.  You think to yourself, how can the Lord be so unfair as to give a life only to take it back?  Instead of receiving healing from an illness, why does someone have to die because of it?   I guess there are no easy answers when it comes to questions about dying and death. But I’ve heard a lot of people give solutions easily when it comes to living life. You’ve heard most of them I’m sure: LIVE LIFE TO THE FULLEST, CARPE DIEM, SEIZE THE DAY, LIFE IS TOO SHORT, etc…Yes they’ve all become clichés, things you say in a speech to a newly-graduated class to inspire or worse yet, the theme of your high school yearbook. They’ve become overstated and tired. But in times such is these, they seem to mean a lot more than we’ve made them out to be. Because when someone has died, whether it’s someone close to us or someone we hear about on tv, you suddenly begin to think about all the issues you have pending in your life: the book you’ve been meaning to read but have never found time for, the boxes of pictures you started scrapbooking 3 years ago but are always too tired to finish, the dress you’ve been saving for a special occasion, the vacation with your family you’ve been meaning to plan, and the fight with a friend you’ve been lulling over so long you can’t remember why you made each other so angry. You think about these things for awhile hoping and planning on finally doing something about it, until you’re distracted by another one of life’s worries. Before you know it, another 5 years have passed and you still haven’t read that book, those pictures are still in those boxes, you’ve outgrown the dress, your family’s disbanded and your strained relationship with that friend has surpassed all hope of resolution. Life IS too short not to do the things you want, not to love the people who love you and I wish I could remind myself daily that tomorrow may not be mine to plan on.

       BLOWN AWAY   I just stepped out on the terrace here at the office (we’re on the 4th floor looking over Glenoaks Blvd in Burbank and we have a balcony furnished with a plastic dining set; 1 table and 4 chairs) and I noticed how windy it is right now. Oh I wish you guys could see the mountains just ahead. The sky is SO clear and SO blue that it looks like God pasted the mountain onto the sky, the lines are so distinct! This is why I love windy days, no smog looming over us.  This semi-windy day, however, doesn’t compare to a tumultuous one we had last week. I believe it was Monday or Tuesday evening when I was listening to all the potted plants outside getting knocked over as I tried to fall asleep. I said to myself, “Man, the streets are gonna be full of palm leaves and crap tomorrow!” So I get to work in the morning and I happened to look out the glass door that led to the terrace. And I said, “hmmm, something looks weird.” But I dispelled this suspicion and headed back to my desk for another fun-filled day of carpel tunnel-inducing data entry. At about 3 pm, I started getting sleepy (as usual) so I went outside to the balcony to get some air and then I realized…OH MY GOSH THE TABLE’S GONE! The chairs, which were stacked together, were knocked over but the table was gone! I looked over to the island divider on the street down below and I saw bits and pieces of white plastic scattered alongside its curb. The wind must’ve blown the table off the balcony and it must’ve crashed into something and shattered! At first all of us were like, “Oh man, what if it caused an accident?” We felt bad for a quick second and busted up laughing. OUR PLASTIC TABLE GOT BLOWN AWAY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT! What is this, the WIZARD OF OZ? El fin…

       Proud   Last friday I spent the evening catching up with some great friends. Some I talk to, if not everyday, every other day, and others I haven't seen in months or years. It's times such as these when you witness the embodiment of true friendship. Except for Cile, who is our honorary, I spent practically everyday with these girls; talking about boys, "suffering" through espanol, world civ, US history or experiencing god! And of course we discussed, in length, about our futures. I look at them now and I am so proud to see who they've become.  There is Daphne, who, I think is the most naturally intelligent person I know. Lawyer to be at the UCLA School of Law, she will kick ass in the courtroom one day and I can't wait to watch her. Rochelle, who's graduating from Pharmacy school THIS YEAR, is the most fervent student I know. You don't know true dedication and sacrifice for career and school until you've met her. Iya, who just got a new job working for LA county, and who you will constantly hear me raving about is finally getting a chance to show off her skills. YOU GO GET 'EM GIRL! Cheryl, nurse and wife-to-be, I don't know who's happier, me or her. Vanessa works for an investment firm and she said she loves where she works. Loving where you work and who you work for is success to me. Jessica, a graduate of FIDM, is a design consultant for Bebe. She's as stylish, but not over the top, as they come and I know one day she'll have a fashion show of her designs on E!'s Style Network. Riza, whose fatigue from working the night before still showed during dinner, is one of my MANY nurse buddies who I can't say enough admirable things about. She just bought a new Toyota Solara Sport! Her sister Kristine, who's always been artistic, has a fetish for sneakers and, I just know, will be discovered for her talent someday soon. And then there's Cile, who's lack of doubt in life has helped her name earn recognition in PAYCHECK's end credits. We tease her about leaving her children at the grocery store one day, or losing her wallet everyday, but the truth is, I never fear for this girl because she always lands on her feet regardless of what's thrown her way.  I can't find the words to decribe the admiration and awe I feel for these friends of mine, who have not only grown up to be successful and ambitious career women, but have managed to stay true to themselves in the process. None of them have been disillusioned by adversity or even success and I am proud to know them.

       Getting to know...      CHRISTINE JOANNE BAUTISTA GONDA aka TIN-TIN    History:  Born 12 years and 5 months after me, she is my "little" sister = 13 1/2 years and counting...  Role in my life:  The Calm Sister (think Daria, but not as dark) - We may look alike and we dress basically the same way (Sisters are all about sharing clothes!), and although neither of us are/were troublemakers (well, she's only 13. It might be too soon to tell),  Tin and I are still as different as night and day when it comes to personality and attitude. Where I like to overreact and wallow in self-pity and frustration when given ample opportunity, Tin likes to say, "oh well...moving on." I'm 12 years her senior, but sometimes when you're around us, you wonder who the mature one really is.  Good Times:  Having the randomest FRIENDS dvd viewings...right after dinner, in the middle of eating breakfast, while we're sitting in the living room watching a movie...With me and Tin, anytime is always a good time to watch an episode or 2 of FRIENDS.  In her own words:  "Ate, what the heck does that man anyway?"...what Tin?..."Word to your mother?"

        Getting to know...      Joseph John Mari A. De Los Reyes aka Deeeeck    Vitals:  Met freshman year of high school in 1992. Iya and I were talking to Jhoette on the phone and he was telling us about their new friend Joe who graduated from St. Brendan. After raving about how cool he was, Iya and I were like, “Oh cool, can’t wait to meet him.” To which Jhoette responded, “Oh good cuz I gave him your phone numbers already.” Joe called about 5 minutes after that conversation = 12 years and counting  Role In My Life:  Caring and Accommodating Friend – Caring and accommodating are the only words I could think of to translate into English a tagalong term I think describes Joe: “maasikaso.” I’m not that confident about the spelling, but anyhow, it means he’s all about making sure everyone’s taken care of, whether it’s calling to ask if I needed a ride home from school or following me home when I drove from Irvine to Glendale for the very first time by myself.  Good Times:  In the summer of 1997, Joe and I took a geography class at Glendale Community College to help fulfill some social science class requirements for UCI (This is when we he was a bio major and I was a chemical engineering major. Little did we know we’d be all about social science classes after that summer!) The class was 8 weeks long (I think), Monday-Thursday, 8-10 am. Our ONE fieldtrip took place on a Saturday morning, to the Palmdale section of the San Andreas fault. Joe took his navy blue, Honda civic…NO AIR CONDITIONING!…IN THE MIDDLE OF JULY!…AAAAAAAAAAAH! We drove all the way there and back with the windows open and the blaring heat and sand all up in our faces!  In his own words:  “Hey, don’t hate.”

       STAYIN' *NSYNC   I have accounting homework to finish (of course), but I just finished watching *NSYNC: TRUE HOLLYWOOD STORY on E! and I am reminded of how much I miss these guys so I HAVE to write an entry about it. Go ahead and laugh! I know some of you are probably rolling your eyes, talkin' your smack, but hey, I was and always will be a fan.   Since I watched their Disney concert special in 1998, I was hooked! Yes, I will admit, that I liked the Backstreet Boys too...I liked them like I like, ummm...Beyonce or Dido. Cool songs, I'd buy their cd's, but that's it. Something about Justin, Chris, Joey, JC and Lance caused an unbelievable attachement issue with me though. It wasn't just their music and their dancing or their looks and their fashion that attracted me, it's that they looked like they'd be fun to hang out with. Their songs, some which were so ridiculously catchy and others just great to listen to (corny ballads and all), were pleasant to the ears. Oh man, was I in trouble upon this discovery! It was New Kids on the Block all over again...or was it? How long, I wondered, would THIS phase last?   All of a sudden, others around me began to cave in to the boys' charm as well: Ate Tin-Tin (who accompanied me to my very first *NSYNC concert at the forum, convinced me to ditch class to drive up to Big Bear to see them), Iya (who when she was at my house and I was recording *NSYNC on the Tonight Show said, "Who are these guys, the Backstreet Boys?" and "oh my gosh I can't believe you memorize their dance steps?!"), Leia (who refused to pay anything over $20 to watch a concert when I asked her if she wanted an extra ticket we had, but ended up going to like 4 of the 8 concerts I attended), Fantone (who 2 days after seeing them in concert for the first time MET JC!), Isa (who couldn't believe she got convinced into attending the NO STRINGS ATTACHED concert in San Diego but came out WITH AN *NSYNC GLOW STICK AROUND HER NECK talkin' 'bout "SPACE COWBOY WAS MY FAVORITE PART OF THE SHOW!!"). I gotta give it to my lovely Irvine gals (with the exception of Annie, who stayed true to her love for 311 and NO DOUBT), for being down to drive to the Rose Bowl, for being down to get up at 5 am so we could be part of MTV's Road To Celebrity before the POPOdyssey tour in San Diego and for being down just to join in the fun! I'm sure Iya is really proud of her fellow UCLA *NSYNC crew as well: Irene (the one true Lance fan I know), Rochelle, Randy, Rachele, Fernand and Marnelli! I'm proud of them too!  So, 6 years, 4 albums, 8 concerts and a gazillion magazine covers later, I'm still a fan (among others) and I think that says something about them (they're no flashes in the pan) and me (I wasn't a fan just to be a fan because they were hot at a certain point in time). Many have allowed the *NSYNC mania to flush out of their system and that's cool. At least they got to experience it. As for the millions of us faithful diehards left (Hey Ate, Ate Cyn, Iya and Rachele!!!), we wait breathlessly for whatever the boys have in store for us next. With this I shall depart with *NSYNC's most famous words...ByeByeBye...

       A WEEKEND WITH THE MORELOS’   I’ve known the Morelos’ for 14 years because they’re Iya’s family and I love them like my own! Lemme break ‘em down for you all, just for fun. Head of the family, Tito Nesty, soft-spoken and calm (like many of our dads are), always has a smile on his face and an occasional cap on his head. He’s Mr. Tennis Pro who loves and real often sounds like Frank Sinatra (wow, sipsip!). Tita Susie, Iya’s mommy, has always reminded me of Cindy Walsh, Brenda and Brandon’s mom on 90210. It’s cuz she’s such a caring, well-spoken woman, a problem solver, who always has a solution to life’s problems, big and small. She’s also quite the brain, which validates Iya’s “intelligence” I guess…hee hee hee…just playing Iya! You know I’m justh jealousth of you! Iya’s got two older brothers; Kuya Dennis, who has inherited Tito Nesty’s taciturn disposition, is married to Ate Myla, a nurse. They're expecting their first baby this summer; Kuya Francis, funny man who proudly works for DREAMWORKS, is married to Ate Jenny (a future singer I tell you!). They’re expecting their first baby this May (or maybe April, according to their doctor) and my sister and I had the pleasure of assisting Iya with their baby shower this past Saturday. You already know Iya so I won't talk about her (Refer back to her  Getting to know   profile on January 26th for further info).  So the baby shower, themed with moon and stars, was inspired by the DREAMWORKS symbol. It was so funny because so many of Kuya Francis and Ate Jenny's friends are having babies too. There were AT LEAST 3 or 4 pregnant women there this weekend, I kid you not! I think that’s so wonderful! All their kids have future playmates already! I can’t wait until all of you who are reading this start having kids! Can you imagine? 10 years from now, most of us will be parents! Scary thought considering the boys are still way into their lemme-try-to-grab-your-crotch-as-my-way-of-saying-hello stages. Anyhow, everyone had fun at the shower with the fun games and great food provided. GREAT JOB NINANG IYA!  On Sunday, I attended a memorial service and mass for Iya’s ninang, Tita Annie, who passed away last week. Bittersweet was the day, as most memorial services tend to be. Sad as everyone was for her passing, it was also a day that celebrated her life. Iya’s relatives from the east coast even flew out here to add to the loving farewells to a family member who I know they will miss dearly.   Seeing how a family reacts to two such juxtaposing events such as those that surpassed this weekend is a true telling of their character. Joyous was Saturday afternoon, overflowing with excitement and anxiety for the new parents-to-be, not to mention the freshest little light of life to come. Sunday was somber, filled with a regretful sadness that only death can bring, but capped with a unique comfort that only family can provide. These are the Morelos’, and spending time with them this weekend only reminds me of how lucky I am as well, to be part of a family as fun-loving, quirky and caring as they are. Ever present are the trials that life can bring, but so too are the ties that bind, that which we call family.

       SURPRISE!   Last Friday we celebrated Edwin’s birthday at a wonderful little restaurant in Toluca Lake called Mardi Gras. Decorated with beautiful paintings and artifacts, you’d swear you were in New Orleans. The tables were set with beads for each place setting. The highlight of the evening, however, was not the great food or the unique ambiance, but the biggest surprise we could imagine.   Iya had advised us earlier that week that she was bringing her sister-in-law, Ate Jenny, to dinner and that she might arrive a little late. Half of us got to the restaurant at 7:20 pm and by about 8:30-ish, everyone else but Iya and Ate Jenny had arrived (We were supposed to be there by 7:00 pm. Pilipino time I swear!). Rochelle received a phone call from Iya shortly after asking if they were the only ones we were waiting for and she said yes. Awaiting Iya’s arrival, we all just sat there talking, waiting to order when who walks through the doorway?…JHOETTE! I think we all got whiplash from the shock, our heads snapping back at the surprise. We weren’t expecting to see him until Saturday night. It turns out, Iya had picked him up Wednesday or Thursday night, but he wanted to surprise all of us so he made her keep quiet until Edwin’s birthday dinner. What a wonderful surprise!  We spent the rest of the evening at Edwin’s house, playing mahjong and tearin’ it up on the magic mic. Could we BE anymore our parents?

        Getting to know...      Carlo P. Loredo aka CAHlo    Vitals:  Met in 1982 in kindergarten. It used to take Carlo’s mom forever to leave because he SO didn’t want to be left at school. He totally used to cry = 22 years and counting  Role In My Life:  Quiet But Ever-Present Friend = We punk Carlo a lot for being so quiet and reserved, and he’s such a good sport about it. We often wonder what’s going through his mind because he seldom, if EVER, speaks. Being a person of so few words, he’s the friend who lets his actions do the talking. If you need him to be somewhere to watch you graduate, leave the country, or just have coffee, he’ll be there.  Good Times:  When we were in the 8th grade, we were assigned to write an  ORIGINAL  short story to read out loud in reading class the next day. I worked mighty hard on that story about a girl recounting a drug overdose, realizing at the end of the story that she was the girl who o-d'ed. Anyhow, after a few of us had had our turns, Carlo was up to read his story. Here’s a little taste. This isn’t verbatim but it’s close: “Roman had been gone for so long that Marlena had forgotten what her own husband looked like. Seeing the man who had stood beside her all these years, she realized that this was not the Roman she had married, but a man named John Black.” When Carlo was reading, in my head I was like, “What the hell man! That’s from DAYS OF OUR LIVES!” Yes people, Carlo, during our junior high years, was so obsessed with DAYS OF OUR LIVES he incorporated it on a reading assignment!  In his own words:  “Dickdude, I dunno though…really though?”

       LITTLE MISS FICKLE   ...That's ME in a nutshell! I haven't made a sound decision on anything in so long that I've just about floated through this vast body of water I call life practically void of mistakes and, sadly, experiences to learn from.  Making choices is a weakness for me because I've developed a chronic mistrust in my decision-making skills, trying to avoid any unexpected losses of pride. Take note, for example....  For the last few months...okay the last few YEARS, I've been wading through life, trying to get a feel for my career options so I can finally start doing something I am comfortable doing. It has been 4 years since I got my blessed B.A. and I feel (as most of you know) absolutely lost as to what comes next. Back in the easy streets of college life, I never thought PAST attaining my bachelor's degree. It was hard enough to get THAT! But I've come to realize in the last few years, however, that a B.A. in International Studies is...just a B.A. It's no Master's, and everyone knows that if you graduate with a B.A. in a social science/liberal arts major, a Master's is almost always forthcoming. So was anyone planning to tell me any of this BEFORE I dropped out of the B.S. race in Chemical Engineering? No, not really. I haven't had one 24-hour day where I wasn't wondering when my life was going to change.  So tonight I decided (FINALLY!) to take a matter into my own hands and attend an informational meeting with the University of Redlands extension in burbank on attaining an MBA. An MBA? ME? Do I LOOK like I could be one of Donald Trump's apprentices? Not yet, but I could be. Wedding planner - MBA - CPA - writer - photographer...oh the possibilities are endless! But to be honest with you, sometimes I hate this free will thing we have. I'd rather someone just tell me what I'm good at and what I should do with it. But NO, we get to be the makers of our own futures! How bittersweet is this gift from God?

        Getting to know...      MARIA LARNIE BOQUIREN aka LARNIE    Vitals:  Met the summer of 1999. I was working at the bookstore and Andrew, Larnie’s brother, called from Clone Notes (downstairs) to let me know his sister was on the way up to the bookstore and for me to meet her. It wasn’t hard to figure out who she was cuz she looks just like her 4 older brothers = 5 years and counting.  Role In My Life:  My Star – Larnie is an entertainer. Every time we talk, provided neither of us are venting over current issues, we’re always always laughing. Furthermore, she’s my volleyball all-american superstar. Talk about talented and dedicated to the game and to sports in general. An aspiring kinesiologist, you’ll see her in a few years on tv stretching out athletes before games.  Good Times:  When Larnie was a freshman, I used to pick her up from the dorms…like every other day. And she’s always carrying a pillow, her backpack, and a basket of laundry to do at our apartment!!  In her own words:  “How do you curl the bottom?”…the bottom what?…”Eyelashes!”…Larnie you don’t curl the bottom eyelashes with an eyelash curler you silly!

       MOVIE MAKE-OVERS: CAN THEY RESULT IN TRUE LOVE?   I know geez, what a long title, but I just finished watching the ABC family movie,  CELESTE IN THE CITY  and I just had to talk about this. (For future reference, Iya, Rochelle and I love ABC Family movies. They're all pretty predictable, but so God-awfully entertaining and heartwarming that it's hard to resist).   Anyhow, you've all seen it; a girl (or guy) in a movie is not the hippest, not the best dresser, not the most popular, is kind of a geek or weirdo and some form of intervention decides to dote upon this poor, tactless being an opportunity for a new life...by making them more "attractive" so as to instill some form of confidence. Upon this make-over, suddenly people begin to notice they're worthy of attention, thereby cueing the most popular girl or guy around to fall madly in love with this newly made up person they had ignored before their "big change."  SHE'S ALL THAT, CAN'T BUY ME LOVE, MISS CONGENIALITY : These are all examples of this situation and I liked all these movies. But deep inside I think it sucks that it always takes something like a make-over to make someone notice you, in order for them to WANT to spend time with you AND THEN realize you're a person worthy of their love. WHAT A CROCK I think sometimes.  But this movie tonight, it was a little different.  I loved it because Kyle, Ethan Embry's character (the "leading man" if you will) fell for this girl, Celeste, BEFORE her stupid make-over. It's kind of cute because she initially thought that he was gay so she acted like herself, not feeling the need to be prim and proper to impress him. Anyhoo, he did so many wonderful things for her and he loved her company, before she had her frizzy curly hair straightened, got contacts and found some fashion sense. It was nice to see. I hope there are people out there like Kyle, who won't fall for someone because they look like Brad Pitt or Britney Spears. I remember telling someone that the guy who falls in love with me when I'm in a sweatshirt and warm-ups, glasses and headband is the definitive keeper. Is this optimism or what?

       THANKS ARNOLD!   Man, I’ve been layin’ out entry after entry this week haven’t I? Well, I’ve had a lot to talk about. First the marathon, then realizing how much I love living here, then Matt getting his new job, and now this!… I don’t know if any of you have ever heard that superstition that when you right palm itches, you’ll be coming into some money, somehow, sometime soon. Well, my hand’s been itchy this week and on Wednesday night I found out why. I got a refund from the DMV after the freakin’ $400+ registration fee I paid in December for my car! I didn’t vote for Arnold during the whole recall elections and I wasn’t that convinced he could live up to anything he said, but THIS REFUND! I was just shocked. Thanks terminator! What else can you do?

       "911 - emergency response..."   Someone I know is trained to take action upon these very words. My cousin Matt, who left me for dead in a closet when we were 5 years old, has just been hired by AMR (American Medical Response) as an EMT!! (Ironic, isn't it?) I'm so proud of you, Matt! Congratulations! I can't wait to hear all your 12-hour shift stories and of course meet all your hot co-workers (do they all really look like the guys in Third Watch?)!! Good for you, cuz!  This blessed event couldn't have come at more opportune time, as Cile and I had another one of our "talks" last night about people's futures and ambitions. I was saying how proud I was to know such goal-oriented people, such as herself, who have gone out there and attained what they set out to attain. I told her how I've become a lot less unhappy lately but am still completely confused as to where life is leading me. Now that I know how much my parents need me to help support my sister's high school education (She got accepted into Providence High School by the way. YOU GO TIN!), I feel the need to search for a better-paying job above all else; above what I think I'd like to pursue. This now worries me. Can I find a good job I will be paid sufficiently for AND be happy working at? Or am I trapped in this "settling" state of mind? Upon this dilemma, I receive this. Check out what my horoscope for Thursday says:   AQUARIUS: >>Thursday, March 11  The Sun is at odds with Pluto, the planet of transformation, reminding yet again that money can't buy happiness or fundamental contentment - but that you can't eat love, either.  However:  Somewhere there's a happy medium between your creativity and your bank account, and it's a reasonable bet that if you look for it, you'll locate it. Today's star rating:  ***  I guess this answers my question, doesn't it? If I look for it, I will find it; whatever IT is. As much as I hate walking forward without knowing where I'm going, I'm gonna have to have some faith that there's something right out there for me; whether it's working for the state, working for a non-profit organization, getting my MBA, planning people's weddings...or something completely beyond what I expect I can do.   Bottom line: I'm inspired everyday by other people's accomplishments. Matt, you're my source of inspiration today. That's my cousin, Matt, the EMT.

       MORE BIRTHDAYS!!   Happy 26th Birthday Edween!!! And Happy 27th Birthday to my cousin in Cincinnati, Ohio, Chrissy!!!   SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA DREAMIN’   I was driving home from Cile’s house on Sunday and I just have to say that it dawned on me how much I love living here in Southern Cali, LA mostly. (I habitate in Glendale but LA is like a 2 minute drive) Yes, I can totally picture myself living in San Francisco or San Diego, and of course I wouldn’t mind having an apartment overlooking the Washington Monument in DC, but something about living around LA makes me smile.   Cile, Tommy and I drove to McDonald’s somewhere in Hollywood on Sunday afternoon and Tommy saw someone dancing on the sidewalk by herself and Tommy was like, “Damn, LA has so many weird people in it” and it totally made Cile and me laugh cuz it’s so true. Weird, of course, being in the eye of the beholder, but you know what I mean. Anyhow, I saw the HOLLYWOOD sign so clearly in the distance and I said “wow” to myself. What a landmark to live by!   After we watched Ate, Leia, Fantone, Annie and Jeff walk by in the marathon, Cile, Gwen, Joe, Andrew, Tommy and I hung out in Cile’s yard for half an hour and then headed off for an afternoon stroll down Larchmont. Cile sipped on some Jamba juice, Andrew enjoyed a sandwich from Starbucks along with Tommy, who I believe had a mocha latte, and I had a vanilla latte w/ soy milk from the Coffee Bean across the street. We just hung out there for no longer than an hour and then headed back to Cile's house. And on the way to car, guess who I saw? NIA VARDALOS AND IAN GOMEZ! The lady from MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING and Javier from Felicity (her husband!). I know that a couple of years ago, JaJa saw Julia Roberts and Benjamin Bratt sitting at a restaurant on Larchmont too!   We don’t rub elbows with celebrities on a daily basis or anything, but when you live in LA, running into them is no rarity. THEY’RE ALL OVER THE PLACE!…if you have a keen eye for them. But other than celebrity sightings, southern cali screams delight! We’ve got everything here, don’t we? The beaches combed over with great-looking California hotties; Hollywood, the mecca of film-making; In-N-Out!; the Lakers (who still have a fighting chance so please keep hope alive!); the Grove and Farmer’s Market where you can eat every kind of food possible; Disneyland and so much more I can’t even begin to talk of right now. If you haven’t had a chance to hang out here, COME OVER and we'll do lunch!

        Getting to know...      EDWIN F. EVANGELISTA aka EDWEEEEEEN    Vitals:  We met when I was a sophomore in high school. Matt and I used to live in the same apartment complex and one day he came home with Edwin = 10 years and counting  Role in my Life:  Constant Cause of Anguish and Frustration…ha ha ha…just kidding Edwin! For me, Edween is the Undercover Wise One - Seriously, as well as this guy plays the jackass, and the fact that he is proudest of himself when he’s being mean to people, hitting below the belt every chance he can get, he’s got some of the most insightful things to say when you need it.   Good Times:  It’s easiest for me to tell this story via dialogue. Some of you may have heard this already but I know you won’t mind recalling it. Picture me and Edwin in my car:  Me:  Hey Edwin, guess what I bought!  Edwin:  What?  Me:  The extended version of LORD OF THE RINGS!! (Fellowship of the Ring)  Edwin:  Oh dope, how much did you get it for?  Me:  $29.99…not too bad. I thought it was gonna cost more.  Edwin:  You didn’t get the $60 one?  Me:  No, why there’s a version that’s $60 bucks? Is it even longer?  Edwin:  No, but it comes with bookmarks.  Me:  Oh…(puzzled look on my face). They’re freakin’ charging $30 more for bookmarks?   Edwin:  Yeah…  Me:  Okay, that’s dumb…(5 minutes of silence pass cuz I’m still wondering why you’d pay $60 just for bookmarks). Are they gold-plated?  Edwin:  What?  Me:  The bookmarks?   Edwin:  No. They’re just bookmarks. They look like stone.  Me:  Oh okay…(Stone? still puzzled. 5 more minutes pass)…Why the hell would you pay $30 extra for bookmarks? Must be like a set of collectible ones huh?  Edwin:  Naw, they’re just bookmarks. There’s two of them. Remember that part when they’re on the boat going down the river and they see the huge statues of the former kings and they’re like this to each other? (Edwin makes a gesture with his hand as if to say “Stop in the name of love.”) They hold up the books on each side.  Me:  THOSE ARE BOOKENDS DUDE!  Edwin:  Oh…we never had this conversation…  In his own words:  “Yeah, I bet you guys can’t even wear BELLYbottoms.” – It’s BELLbottoms dummy!

       LET'S HEAR IT FOR THE BOYS!   This past friday, Iya, my sister and I went to Barnes & Noble to "study." What ended up happening was, the three of us sat at one of the tables at Starbucks, my sister did homework and Iya and I talked...well, I talked and Iya listened. I hadn't talked to her in a week and I had a lot of stuff to cover!! YOU'RE SUCH A GREAT LISTENER IYA! We had fun reading through horoscope books to see if what they say about our signs is true and which signs we're compatible with. HILARIOUS!! So we've established that Iya the scorpio (which is the sex sign of the zodiac by the way) is, in short, jealous, secretive, manipulative and fierce. (IYA? Manipulative and fierce? No way!) In addition, she's attracted to "rock stars and guys who are already involved with someone." INTERESTING EH? She's compatible with another scorpio daw. She hasn't met any male scorpios though so please be on the lookout for her, thanks! I am an aquarius (the friendly sign of the zodiac, which validates my fortune in having you all in my life, but sadly also reaffirms my lack of "lovers"). I am a free-spirited individual who loves her freedom apparently. Based on this fact, I've hypothesized that maybe the reason why I've never had a boyfriend is because deep inside my subconscious, I really don't want one (added to my inability to communicate emotions but that's another entry)...Hmm, don't quote me on that though because Friday night was also spent talking about crushes.   I told Iya that eversince she and Mark broke up and I've been hanging out with her more, I've gotten as boy crazy as she is. I feel like I'm 10 times more aware of minor and major attractions towards the opposite sex in the last 2 years. Crushes are super-fun...when they REMAIN crushes that is. Once you pass that and enter the "like" zone, THEN it can become heartbreaking, but that, too, is another blog entry to be explored...  So...what do you guys know about YOUR signs?   urlLink Check it out here

       RUN FORREST!!   What a perfect day it was today. Sunny and hot, the climate was right for a walk on the Santa Monica Pier, a stroll down Larchmont, a day at the park...and a marathon! I would like to take a moment to give a big, huge congratulations to Ate Tin-Tin, Annie, Leia, Fantone and Jeff for finishing the LA Marathon!!!! Joined by Cile, Tommy, Andrew, Gwen and Joe (DeLos not mama), I stood in front of St. Brendan Church observing in woderment as thousands of people walked, jogged and ran through mile 21! In all the years I've been an LA resident, I've never once sat/stood along the marathon route. 26 MILES!!! Holy Lord! I do 15 minutes on the treadmill and I'm sore as hell! Mucho pride for these five friends of mine! Perhaps next year we'll join you!...Or stand by and wait to give you Gatorade...whichever...

       CONDOLENCES   Will everyone please pray for one of our friends, Cheryl and her family? Her grandmother passed away this week and I’m sure they’d all appreciate your thoughts and prayers.

       LET THE SUN SHINE   Is that what the sky really looks like? I had almost forgotten! After weeks of rainy, lethargic weather, here we are under the bright blue backdrop that is the sky. The first sunny day after a rainstorm is one of my favorite things! I love how windy it is after a storm so that there isn’t any smog looming over us. As Molly Shannon’s SNL character the joyolist would say, “I love it I love it I love it!”   I’m in such a weird mood right now. I think it’s because I’m keeping myself from being a stressed about nothing and just being cool. On Sunday, after our drive down from Running Springs, my friend Thuy and I were getting out of the car at St. Elizabeth’s and I was all short of breath cuz I was scared we were gonna be late. So she put her hand on my shoulder and she’s like, “Anna, relax. We’re here, everything’s gonna be fine.” And I was like, yeah Anna, chillax…  Ok that’s all. I just wanted to share that with all of you!

       FIGHTING DESTINY   Please take a few seconds and read the following lyrics to a song by Basil Valdez, a Filipino legend when it comes to singing and song-writing.   LIFT UP YOUR HANDS   Life is not at all that bad, my friend If you believe in yourself  If you believe there's Someone  Who walks through life with you  You'll never be alone  Just learn to reach out,  And open your heart  Lift up your hands to God,  And He'll show you the way.   And He said, "Cast your burdens upon Me  Those who are heavily laden,  Come to Me, all of you who are tired  Of carrying heavy loads,  For the yoke I will give you is easy  And My burden is light,  Come to Me and I will give you rest."   When you feel the world  Is tumblin' down on you,  And you have no one  That you can hold on to,  Just face the rising sun  And you'll see hope,  And there's no need to run  Lift up your hands to God,  And He'll make you feel all right.   And He said, "Cast your burdens upon Me  Those who are heavily laden,  Come to Me, all of you who are tired  Of carrying heavy loads,  For the yoke I will give you is easy  And My burden is light,  Come to Me and I will give you rest."   I spent the weekend up in Running Springs (it's by Big Bear, but not quite so far up)  to help out with a retreat. Actually, I almost didn't make it. All week last week I struggled with this decision and it seemed that every time I stumbled upon a reason not to go, something or someone always found a way for me to make it. I don't know what was stopping me. Homework? Family gatherings and obligations? A friend's party? All of it mattered to me, but something inside kept pushing me to go. I literally decided to attend the retreat late Thursday evening and I packed so haphazzardly that I didn't even know what the heck I put into my duffle bag when it was time for me to change on Saturday afternoon.  So I did participate and I'm so glad I did. It's funny how God works sometimes. We ask for help, we ask for relief and when it comes time for our prayers to be answered, we're so pre-occupied that we don't notice it. The last few months have been nothing short of hectic for me and as much as I enjoy hanging out with friends and family, I suddenly grew very tired and I felt like I was wearing myself thin trying to participate in every event, every outing, every conversation, etc. I remember saying how I'd love to just be away for a weekend with my cell phone off...just me. But alone time, I've found, is a luxury. This past weekend looked like another task to me when I first thought of going to this retreat. But I'd have to say that it was exactly where I was supposed to be. Granted I was accompanied by at least 40 or 50 other people (wonderful wonderful newfound friends!), our reason for being up there was where I found solace: to be away from our daily stresses and spend some time with God. Just me and You, God.   I've been teased since I was little about being "holy" or "immaculate" and at first I thought it was a compliment. Later on it became a burden; as if I were this prude putting on a show for people. "Look at me, holier than thou." It was never about that, but I know it's what some of my friends might've thought. For a long while I did re-examine this theory. WAS I being self-righteous or did others just not understand? And then I realized, it's no one's business and my faith is my own.   LIFT UP YOUR HANDS (reminds me of my friend Glenn, but that's a story to be heard from the eye witnesses...hee hee hee...Dorothee, write about it in your blog please!) - I love this song because it signifies a solution to everything I find difficult to understand or deal with, and that's prayer. I can't recommend it enough.

       Getting to know...     Jesus Christ...aka JC...ha ha ha...jk    Vitals:  Met when I was only 1 month old. That was my baptism day = 26 years and counting  Role In My Life:  Friend, Brother, Father / Lord and Savior - As I've gotten older, I've come to personify our God as not only this entity we Catholics worship in the silent prayers of our hearts or praise during weekly mass, but a Spirit who lives in everything and everyone; a source of faith we turn to in times of joy and especially in times of sadness and pain.  Good Times:  Everytime something good or bad happens, there He is beside me.  In His own words:  "And I tell you, ask and you shall receive; seek and you will find; knock and the door will open to you." (LUKE 11:9)

       WELCOME BABY! WELCOME SPURS!   So I didn't spend the evening on the treadmill at the gym or at home watching the Lakers beat the Houston Rockets. I was with Iya and Jhoette at Cedars Sinai Hospital becaue Iya's got a new nephew. That's right! Kuya Francis and Ate Jenny had baby Matthew Lorenzo Morelos at 6:30 pm today, April 28th. At only 7 lbs 1 oz and 19 1/2 inches, his parents are already looking forward to his future as a doctor, a Laker or an American Idol! He's got dark curly hair (it was combed down though after his first bath), a light complexion (like his mommy) and the features of a Morelos (like his daddy). Jhoette and I both got to hold him for a few minutes and I can't say enough of how it feels to hold a newborn baby. Congratulations to the whole family, especially first-time parents, Kuya Francis & Ate Jenny, first-time grandparents, Tito Nesty & Tita Susie and new auntie Iya!!!! Can't wait 'til Kuya Dennis and Ate Myla have theirs!  Yes it's been a joyous evening. As we were walking through the hallway towards the elevators, a bunch of people were watching the game in the waiting room so we got to see the last 40 seconds or so. GREAT JOB LAKERS! BRING ON THE SPURS!  A new baby AND the Lakers advancing to the 2nd round of the playoffs? Who can I hug for such a great day?

       CHA CHA CHA 'IN ALL THE WAY TO GOTHAM   Oh Cecile Marie Fortun Tecson...when you throw a party, you THROW A PARTY! Saturday evening was Cile's 26th Birthday celebration and all that morning, bright and early at 8 am, as I went to get an oil change, washed my car, ran to the bank and cleaned house (oh, and do my nails...hee hee hee), all I wanted was for it to be 6:00 pm so I could hang out with my friends!  So I was done getting ready by 5:15, waiting patiently for Jhoette and Randy to arrive so we could head out at 5:45 on the dot as Iya had asked. Thankfully, Randy drove so Jhoette was forced to get ready quicker than he's used to so we were actually on time when we picked up Iya from Church (Thanks again Randy!). We had dinner at a restaurant on the corner of Virgil and Melrose called Cha Cha Cha. The restaurant isn't very big but you don't pay for space, you pay for food and ambiance. A party of 36, we provided each other with enough distraction to last the evening through (our favorite distraction being Cile's niece Arianna. CUTE BABY!!!). Our bill came to $836, no gratuity included. And because we were in the company of generous friends and family, we were $64 over in collections. Cile used that for drinks later on.  We got to Gotham Hall on 3rd Street at around 9:30 pm. Ready to dance and drink the night away, everyone headed towards the bar to take part in the libations. And the rest of the evening, need I say, was filled with the great times you can only remember with fondness: Everyone's new haircuts, Cile downing practically everything people handed to her, Riann doing her best impression of Beyonce's "Naughty Girl" video, seeing people you haven't seen in the longest time, watching couples make out against the walls or on the couch (geez people get a room!), Anna sandwiches on the dancefloor (I personally did NOT find this amusing but others seemed to get a laugh), hearing Edwin scream "WESTSIDE 'TIL I MUTHAF*CKIN' DIE!" every 10 seconds, Joemama complaining that the evening's version of Drunk Iya was not up to par, witnessing the Iya-Jhoette-Christine-Mark connection in its funnest form yet, Edwin and Joe needing their own dancefloor...lots of new memories.  We ended the evening with a late late late dinner at Norm's; steaks, belgian waffles, french toast....mmmmmm...  All I wanted from that evening was for the celebrant to have fun and I believe she did. No one deserves it more! Happy Birthday again C-cil!!!   urlLink Here's some footage!

       CECILE MARIE FORTUN TECSON   I forgot to greet you on my blog yesterday Cile! So, HAPPY 26TH BIRTHDAY C-CIL! Thanks for the great conversation last night! It doesn't happen often enough.  Here kids, read about Cile's twin...    Getting to know...      GWEN ANTONIO aka GWEEEEN / Gwennie    Vitals:  Gweeeen and I met our sophomore year at UCI because we did a dance for PCN called Pasigin where we pretended to be fisherchicks = 6 years and counting  Role In My Life:  Our Most Dedicated Commuter – Seriously, this girl has to be one of the most hardworking friends you can ever have; and I’m not talking about what a good student she is or what an excellent nurse she’s gonna make. After graduation, Gwen moved back home to the land of strawberries and outlets: Oxnard. Screw the possible 3 hour drive to Irvine or the hour drive to Glendale or LA in the horror of southern Cali traffic. If it’s your birthday or you just wanna have lunch, shop and watch a movie, Gwen will stand the long commute and then head back home at 2 in the morning just to be with you. We don’t say it enough, but I can’t tell her how much that means to us.   Good Times:  On my 21st birthday, we had a party at our apartment. After 2 huge mugs of strawberry daiquiri, I was out! I hung on until midnight to blow out the candles on my cake, then I ran to the bathroom, hurled and knocked out on my bed while everyone partied downstairs. I woke up at about 3:00 am to someone else groaning in the room. I struggle to turn over and there’s Gwennie, knocked out on Terry’s bed, moaning cuz her stomach hurts and she’s got a headache. Looks like I wasn’t the only one who’d had too much to drink that night!   In her own words:  “I hate her! I hate Ashanti! No talent! She has no talent!” Don’t get Gwennie started on Ashanti

       PASSION AND TEARS   So I finally gave in and watched The Passion on friday night with Iya and Jhoette. I really thought I'd live without having to watch it, thinking that the story had been embedded so deeply in me enough (during 13 years of Catholic school)...plus I heard how long the sscourging scene was (12 minutes I think they said) and I hate watching people suffer. Anyhow, Iya somehow convinced me to just watch it and I did, heart beating as loud as ever the second I sat down in the theater. And then it began, 2 + hours of Jesus' road to Calvary. I cried at least half the time, especially during the scourging. Though my eyes were closed, the lash of the whip hitting flesh wasn't the quietest sound and it just made me sob harder. I think if I had just watched it, maybe I wouldn't have cried so much and might've just sat there in shock to the horror of the torture, the torment.  I couldn't begin to explain how I feel about the movie. It's not your typical blockbuster, chockfull of action sequences and famous headlining actors, and it's no independent film, filled with the simplicity of script and direction. The Passion just IS and I can't recommend that anyone see it or don't see it. It's something I'd leave up to the one caught with the decision. Just don't expect to understand more of a something or even understand less. Don't watch it hoping for answers to questions. That's not what it was to me, but you'd be the judge.

       ANGEL OF GOD, MY GUARDIAN DEAR   Riann and I went to mass today and Fr. Maurice gave a homily about guardian angels. He talked about how we've forgotten they exist. We've been taught in our childhood that at the moment we're brought into this world, we're all assigned a guardian angel who sits on our shoulders, guiding us through life. I remember in elementary school, the prayer to our guardian angel was said right before recess every single day and I don't think it's meant anything to me until I was reminded today.  Fr. Maurice advised that angels are some of our greatest intercessors to God, and moreso our protectors and communication experts. If we're ever in a bind trying to get something across or we're afraid of something, not only can we call on God in prayer, but we can ask for a little assitance from our guardian angels, our lifelong friends. I know it sounds crazy, and maybe even a little childish for a 26-year old to be calling on her guardian angel for help, but it's that mysticism inside all of us that yearns for this kind of help, this kind of faith that you just don't question. Next time you can't seem to figure something out, call on your guardian angel for some aid. You might be surprised.  Fr. Maurice even told us that every guardian angel has a name. He said we don't GIVE them names, we ask and they just let US know. So after communion, in the silence of my reflection and prayer, I asked my guardian angel what their name was and before I could finish the question in my head, I got an answer. My guardian angel's name is Gordon. When we got out of mass I told Riann about my guardian angel and her response was, "So my guardian angel's name is Bruno, and he's German." Ha ha ha...so there you have it, Gordon and Bruno, our guardian angels. I know all of you have got one and as much as you'd like to say this is weird or childish and would rather not participate, just give it a try. Ask YOUR guardian angel what their name is and see if there's anything they can help you with. It never hurts to ask for an extra hand to hold in life.

        Getting to know...      MARK WONGCHAROENSUK aka MARKIE    Vitals:  I can’t remember exactly where I met Mark, but I believe it was around sophomore year in high school. However, I never actually got to talk to him until our junior year = 10 years and counting  Role In My Life:  Mr. Nice Guy – In the decade we’ve known each other, Markie hasn’t done much to upset me (except tease me mercilessly about my height and make my best friend cry but that’s all good now). He’s seriously one of the sweetest, kindest people I know, so loving to his family, especially his little brother and just so much fun to be around. He’s always got a comforting word when you need it, and he’ll say it in that sweet raspy voice of his =) How could someone not be grateful for such company?  Good Times:  Everyone knows that the boys are notorious for their gaseous contributions to our clean air. In other words, they fart like their very livelihood depended on it. One summer day some years ago, I spent an afternoon in Pasadena with Mark & Iya. While Iya was waiting in line to pay for something, Mark and I were standing by the walls, about 10-15 feet away, perusing the merchandise and chatting. Out of nowhere, Mark let out this huge, stank fart and walked away. This caused everyone in line to look my way and when I turned to give Mark a dirty look, HE WAS GONE! Stupid jackass farted off the richter scale and walked out of the store leaving me to take the blame! I walked out of the store and there’s Mark laughing his butt off!  In his own words:  “Magnadildoe…” – To be said in a sing-songy way to the tune of Magnadoodle

       AI LIVE!  (Ate Cyn and Ate, this blog entry’s for you guys!)   Guess what I freakin’ did yesterday? I went to a live taping of American Idol! My aunt called me Monday morning at work and asked if I could get out early Tuesday so I could go. Apparently, she and her co-workers went last week, but didn’t get in because they overdistributed the tickets or something. So to make up for it, they gave her VIP tickets so we wouldn’t have to line up outside the studio. So as fate would have it, my boss is gone and my “supervisor-like” said I could get out at 1:00 pm. I left work at 1:00 pm, picked up some Del Taco for me and my sister (she’s on spring break lucky brat!), and then headed to downtown to pick up my aunt and her 2 co-workers. Oh man downtown LA -- could there be a more confusing place for me? I had to exit off that offramp on the 110 where it’s like 6th/4th/3rd street/Wilshire Blvd (WTF!? PICK ONE!), and I took 4th (the office is on 4th & Flower) and I ended up in the freakin’ Fashion District! I was like, where the hell am I? Cile and Joe, you guys would’ve been laughing at me if you were in the car cuz I was just baffled! Anyhow, I managed to get on 5th, then Figueroa, THEN 4th THEN Flower! Geez louise!!!   We got to the CBS studios on La Bea (or is it Beverly?…No La Brea) at 3:00, parked, then headed to the soundstage. They had port-a-potties outside and we were all so apprehensive about using them. But I told my aunt that since we’re at a studio, they have to be nicer than the regular booty ones. And they so were! The toilets flushed properly, the floor inside was carpeted, there were toilet seat covers(!) and a sink! Fancy!  So we get inside to sit down at about 4:30. Seated in section A, row 7, we waited anxiously for everything to start. We sat right beside Diana DeGarmo’s family and behind George Huff’s family. The only reason I know is because the girl sitting next to me was like SUPERFAN! She was the first person there that day so she got to watch the rehearsals. She was all about it, giving me tidbits about every freakin’ thing that went on. It was kinda cool at first but then it got annoying (picture me rolling my eyes here). Anyhow, the theme was movie soundtracks and I think they all did well, even that red-headed guy and the pen salesman who I think have sucked up to this point. Quentin Tarantino was the guest judge and he was as honest as Simon, not sugarcoating his commentary like other guest judges have done. After LeToya sang (“Somewhere” from West Side Story. DAMN THE PIPES ON THAT CHICK!), Quentin’s all, “I have 3 words for you…POWER F-in HOUSE!” But after everyone performed, they made him tape his comment over cuz of the whole censor thing. He didn’t say the real word. He actually said “’F’ in,” but they made me re-do it anyhow. Gosh.   So I think Diana DeGarmo and Jasmine Trias will get booted this week cuz all the judges are saying how they’ve got great voices but they’re too young, trying to be too old. Oh well, we’ll see. Tune in and see if you can see me. Maybe they’ll pan and you’ll find me clapping away. If you’re looking at the stage, I’d be on the right side, 4th seat from the end of the row towards the front. I’m wearing a white blouse. Hee hee hee…hilarious! I had so much fun…probably moreso if it was last year’s group, but these finalists are cool too. That’s it…hee hee hee…  Watch out for Rochelle, Matt and her mom this Thursday. She has tickets for the results show. Pray she gets in so you can all look out for them too…HILARIOUS GUYS! SIMPLY HILARIOUS WAS THE EXPERIENCE!

       THIS EASTER…   I had work on Good Friday, something I’m SO not used to because for 13 years of Catholic school, we began Easter Break the minute the bell rang at 12:00 pm on Holy Thursday. And then for the past how many years, my office observed Good Friday as a “holiday” so we never had work. But this year, for some unknown reason, they decided to trade Good Friday for Columbus Day! Ummm, ok random.   Anyhow, on Good Friday, my family and I usually spend a good amount of time in church, praying and reflecting as we commemorate Jesus’ passion by doing the stations of the cross. Well, since mom and I had work on Friday, we didn’t get to church until much later in the evening but managed to walk in on station #3 en espanol…estacion tercera…After that, we went to say the rosary at the grade school auditorium where they set up a vigil with the consecrated hosts on an altar-like shrine. Sometimes we get so caught up in the hustle and bustle of life that quiet time is rarely achieved. But it’s always during the Lenten season when I make the true effort to sit in silence and talk to God.   I think I’ve found further purpose for my religion as time has gone by. When you’re younger, you feel a little forced, a little obligated. But when you start making your own decisions, then turning to religion in times of trouble or happiness occurs more willingly than obligatory and that’s how it should be. Well, before I get going on religion, I’ll stop this discussion here.  Easter Sunday was grret! We went to mass at 9:30 am, getting to the parking lot half an hour early to fight for parking spaces and seats. After mass, the family had an early lunch at Olive Garden. After watching the Lakers lose to the freakin’ Sacramento Kings (who I detest along with San Antonio, sorry if you’re a fan) my sister and my cousins, Mari and Kesh and I went to Beverly Center to watch  Ned Kelly . It’s a movie with Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom about an Austrailian outlaw back in the late 1800’s. It’s only on limited release here in the US. The Beverly Center Cineplex was the only place in this area that’s showing it and the theater we were in was like the size of my room! Plus, the mall itself was closed (except for 2 GUESS? stores and the bookstore by the theater) so it was a very dawn-of-the-dead kind of ambiance. So, we thought the four of us would be the only ones there for that movie, which would’ve been fun as hell, but another chick came in. I honestly wasn’t expecting much from the film, but it was actually really interesting and I was super into it (and not only cuz Orlando was in as many scenes as the lead). But oh was it SAD! Very dramatic! After the movie we were like, geez, what a downer! That was my easter…how was yours?

        Getting to know...      RYAN HERMOSA PALOS aka RYAN    Vitals:  Met sophomore year because my high school’s home court for basketball was Daniel Murphy’s court. We went there to cheer for our basketball team and Joe introduced us to Ryan = 11 years and counting   Role In My Life:  Mr. Discipline – Ryan’s one of the most responsible people I know. He’s very unwavering when it comes to work and being healthy. He’ll go to bed at 7 pm to get up for his 3:00 am call time every morning without fail. And, talk about healthy! Have you seen this boy’s bod? “Buff Daddy” we used to call him. He (like all the boys) eats like there’s no tomorrow sometimes, but he’s always got the balance act of working out to prevent that flab from ever appearing.   Good Times:  During the summer of 1996, after we all graduated from high school, Mark, Ryan, Eric, Cile, Rochelle and I all got jobs at Universal Studios. Ryan was a regular at the Studio Grill, the employee cafeteria. Anyhow, we had to head to the wardrobe department everyday to get a new uniform for our shift. One day, Ryan wore a pair of pants that were really tight and he couldn’t figure out why. They were so tight (not to mention a tad short) that the pager on one of his side pockets created this huge bump on his hip! Boy was it was protruding!  If you know what a tall, buff guy Ryan is, you’d know that it was FREAKIN’ HILARIOUS! He found out AFTER his shift that the wardrobe guy gave him the wrong slacks. He wore women’s pants instead of men’s for like 8 hours!  In his own words:  “What do you take me for?…GRANTED?!”    RHEEZERS!!   Happy 26th Birthday to my high school buddy Riza!!!!

       MAYBE SOMEDAY...   Maybe one morning I'll be able to open my eyes and bask in the potential of a new day instead of closing my eyes at night and dreading the coming tomorrow... Maybe one day I'll jump out of bed WHEN the alarm goes off instead of hitting the snooze button and burying my head under the covers... Maybe one day I will look in the mirror as I brush my teeth and say, "Good Morning You!" and mean it... Maybe one day I won't feel so apprehensive about taking chances, reminding myself how much I'm capable of... Maybe someday I'll understand why people do the things that they do, THINKING they're doing more good when they're doing more harm... Maybe one day I can wipe away life's impurities with the purity of a loving and accepting heart...  Maybe someday I'll find optimism in the most pessimistic of situations... Maybe, if I'm lucky, one of these somedays will be someday soon...

        Getting to know...       CYNTHIA GRACE BALANZA aka ATE CYN    Vitals:  Met sophomore year on my first day of tinikling practice in 1998. I was a tapper and she was a dancer. AND, I helped her and Ate Tin-Tin with costumes that year = 6 years and counting.  Role In My Life:  Storyteller Extraordinaire - Have you ever read this girl's blog? She tells you she likes telling stories but that is an UNDERSTATEMENT! Ate Cyn has THOUSANDS of stories to tell. In one night of helping her sew up some pcn costumes (say about 8 hours), I must've heard AT LEAST 20 different things that happened in her lifetime. FREAKIN' HILARIOUS!   Good Times:  2 great moments with Ate Cyn (In addition to the Kelly Clarkson & Clay Aiken concert of course): 1) That night the two of us literally stayed up until morning sewing costumes. We saw the sun set and the sun rise. 2) Ate Cyn knows I'm a neat freak and she never misses the opportunity to take advantage of this. When I was still living in Irvine and she would come over, she'd sneak up to my room and RANSACK my bed. I'm talkin' 'bout sliding the mattress over, scattering my pillows all over the place right after she pulls each pillow half-way out of its pillow cases, scrunching up the comforter and tucking the bedskirt  In her own words:  “You know what JC stands for?...Just for Cyn" -- Ate Cyn after an *NSYNC concert in San Diego

       NOT-SO-GUILTY PLEASURE   Finish my accounting homework or talk about the concert? I'LL TALK ABOUT THE CONCERT! Okay, in case you don't already know, I went to the Kelly Clarkson & Clay Aiken concert last night with Ate Tin-Tin, Ate Cyn and my sister. Yeah yeah yeah, I can hear ALL of you laughing your booties off, hoping for the first opportunity to give me grief. And I will admit, as Ate Tin-Tin and Ate Cyn will also, that every single time someone asked us what we were doing this weekend, we all quickly uttered under our breaths, "Oh, I'm going to a concert" hoping they wouldn't ask which one...which people did every time. But after last night, screw it! I went to the Kelly Clarkson/Clay Aiken concert and I loved it!!!"  My sister and I met up with Ate Tin-Tin at Ate Cyn's house which harbors a front yard garage big enough to fit 15 cars. We played with Ate Cyn's bunnies, Kobe and PJ (short for Phil Jackson) for a few minutes before we headed to Downtown Disney at an attempt to have dinner at Rainforest Cafe before the concert at the Pond. Unfortunately, we axed that idea with only an hour left before showtime and 45 minutes left before we would get seated. We ended up at Carl's Jr. where Ate Tin-Tin suffered through a horrid migraine. As all migraines must be effectively remedied, she  hurled in the bathroom hoping to feel any kind of relief. With a motrin caplet, some Sprite and a few bites of a chicken sandwich in her system, we got to the Pond safely with half an hour left before  showtime. Ate Tin-Tin felt much better by the time Kelly took the stage and moreso when Clay came out.  Yes, I loved the concert and let me tell you why. I've been to a lot of concerts in the last 7 years and fortunately for me, I got my money's worth on all of them. The entertainment and satisfaction level that concerts provide is unprecedented. To watch a favorite performer live is an incredible feeling. Special effects are more than welcome. Shoot, *NSYNC's NO STRINGS ATTACHED and POPOdyssey TOURS were filled with special effects and gags.  But the most memorable part of the concerts for me is never the artist flying over the audience, the 20 costume-changes, the talented back-up dancers or the pyrotechnics cued to the beats of the music. It's the wonder singing on stage. Those songs and the voices that sing them are what gets to the heart. *NSYNC's last tour, CELEBRITY is my absolute favorite tour of theirs because it was just the 5 guys, their band and their music. It was perfection.  Kelly and Clay's stage presence wasn't marked by the blank screen in the back flashing holographic symbols, or the dozens of string lights hanging from the rafters, or the disco ball that spun spots of light around the entire arena. It was the simplicity and power of their voices ringing out in song that made the evening so worthwhile. It was also their personable attitude on stage that got to us. Kelly sat on the edge of the stage as she sang some of her songs and signed autographs for some fans. She gladly accepted a lei from someone in the audience and wore it for a few songs. Clay spotted a girl in the front row talking on her cell phone as he sang and asked to talk to whoever she was talking to. As corny as these actions seem, I thought it showed how down-to-earth they still are and how grateful they've managed to remain. Granted they're not as big as Justin Timberlake or Britney Spears, they're still celebrities who owe a great part of their status to the fans and they really showed their appreciation through this concert.  I can't even begin to tell any of you what great performers Kelly Clarkson and Clay Aiken are. The fact that they sound as awesome live as they do on TV or on the radio is a true testament to their talent. Goosebumps I tell you - every single time they opened their mouths. Amazing!   Thanks Ate, for this stupendous birthday gift! Thanks Ate Cyn for always being such great company! Thanks Tin, for letting us be a part of your first concert experience!   urlLink Check out the concert footage!

       ABERCROMBIE & FITCH   In the words of LFO, “I like girls who wear Abercrombie & Fitch.”…well it’s really no wonder why. Everyone who works there sporting the goods (including the guys) all seem to be attractive young people. I haven’t bought a single article of clothing from there in practically 2 years. Maybe I just haven’t found anything remotely reflective of my style or maybe it’s because you can’t buy anything there for less than $40 unless it’s on the clearance rack. Anyhow, Tita Cecile gave me a $50 gift card for my birthday and since I was gonna be at the mall to shop with Iya and Bobbers anyhow, I thought I’d have a look and see if something there would catch my eye. First I went searching for this blouse I saw on the website. Yes I went on the website. It was one of those bored-to-hell-at-work days (when is it NOT this kind of day, but anyhow), and I remembered the gift card, so I thought I’d peruse the website to see if they had anything I liked. So I found this one blouse and when I got to the store yesterday, ‘lo and behold, there it was staring at me. I grabbed it to try on, knowing it cost $39.50, in addition to another blouse for the same price…just for fun.   I walked through the rest of the store to see if anything else was worth trying on and I noticed that there were a lot more people working the floor than usual. Apparently, there was a group of new-hires getting trained and let me tell you, my insecurities, fully-accepted as they have been for years, came rushing back as I looked at Abercrombie’s newest employees. Handsome young men, who you just know were probably voted most athletic or most popular in their class, were all over the place, hanging new arrivals on display as they modeled the latest merchandise: striped polos worn 2 at a time, with both collars up, cargo shorts and flipflops. With their rusted blonde hair and green and blue eyes, these model-looking guys complimented the cursed little petite chicks, (cheerleaders I bet) parading the store in their short-ass (LITERALLY!) Paris Hilton skirts and A & F tanks and tubetops.   Am I jealous? HEALL YEAH! How many souls does one have to sell to Satan to look like that? To quote Jamie from 98.7, “Bitter – party of 1?!” (Ha ha ha Iya!)

        Getting to know...      THOMAS CLAUDE CARAGUE aka OH TOMMY    Vitals:  Met our junior year at UCI at a Kababayan peer mentor retreat in 1998. There were 30 of us in a small cabin-like hotel room mapping out plans for the school year. Very soon after that, he swept Cile off her feet and next thing you know, we’re friends – 6 years and counting  Role In My Life:  History/Science Fiction/Weapons/Cecile Lover – I don’t know anyone else like Tommy. I don’t know anyone who can watch the History Channel all day, post weaponry on his blog, read science fiction books and then have a heated argument with his girlfriend about what it would be like if wizards and such ruled the world. One night Cile came home from Tommy’s apartment laughing because apparently they had had an argument over…Kosovo! My first impression of Tommy was that A) He’s a smart guy, competitive (characteristic of an only child I think) B) Oh my God, he’s here to take Cile away from me!!!! Ha ha ha…  Good Times:  On our last school dinner in Cambridge, Tommy overdid it on the port (this really sweet red wine) and, sadly, could not join the rest of us for the after-dinner festivities BECAUSE he was sitting by the toilet throwing up (Cile has proof of this)…And then, last year in Hawaii, we went to Sunset Beach to watch the sun set and Tommy was digging in the sand. I thought he was looking for something. Moments later I saw that he had strategically dug himself a recliner in the sand. Oh Tommy! You freakin’ crack me up!   In his own words:  “Peklats…sounds like something you could buy at a store. Like, ‘Dad, we’re out of peklats!’”

       OVERWHELMED LIKE HELL   I know this is like my 4th entry in the last 2 days, but I've just had so much to say. Anyhow, it may well be my last for awhile because it just hit me today how much crap is on my plate.  I'm so tired...of everything. This day felt like it was never gonna end. Again I had to spend 8 hours listening to people complain over the phone, faxing this and that, helping everyone in the office with more of this while trying to finish all of that and aaaaaaaahhhhh! I was so ready to pound my head into the wall today!   And then I had accounting class tonight. Talk about expired icing on my already lopsided cake! We spent 3 1/2 hours on the Statement of Cash Flows...numbers all over the place that I couldn't even begin to think about. She gave us all this reading homework in addition to the project we have due next week. And in 2 weeks we have our final. I'm trying not to stress out cuz I know it won't do me any good but I'm just...worn out that's all. I hope all of you guys are doing well...better than THIS!  Anyhow, thank you Lord for getting me through this day. Please help me get through these next 2 weeks! I guess a session with RETURN OF THE KING will have to wait...

       LORD OF THE RINGS MARATHON HERE WE COME!   Actually, Edwin suggested we wait for the extended version of  Return of the King  before we have our marathon...OK FINE! But I went to Best Buy during my lunch anyhow and bought it. And at Best Buy, if you buy the dvd, you get this special issue of Entertainment Weekly with cast interviews, dvd guide, etc. I love free stuff! I have a project due next Tuesday and a final in 2 weeks. Buying the dvd will surely tempt me away from such obligations but I'll try and be strong.   Again, everyone and their dog was at Best Buy today, all clutching their ROTK dvd. I love when people are so excited, they open up the dvd package even before they get home. When I was at a stoplight, this guy next to me practically ravaged through the plastic and then just kinda stared at the dvd. HA HA HA...EXCITED I THINK! I would've done the same thing if my lunch was longer but I didn't have time.  So, RETURN OF THE KING dvd...GET YOUR COPY TODAY!!! Let's have a hobbit party shall we? They don't call me Frodo for nothing.

       MAMANG & NANAY   I just read Rex's entry about his grandmother and it just so happens that it was my grandmother's birthday yesterday (my mom's mom). Unfortunately she's all the way in the Philippines so I greeted her the way any redblooded Filipino would...I texted my aunts and my cousins to tell her HAPPY BIRTHDAY for me.   I left the Philippines when I was only 4 years old and didn't go back for a visit until I was 23. In the 19 years that I was gone, Mamang went from the bubbly able-bodied lady that I left in 1982 to a woman overcoming a stroke some years before. She was a lot skinnier than I remembered her and the stroke left her speech somewhat compromised so she hardly talks. Trying to talk to her on the phone sometimes makes me want to cry cuz I just feel bad, like as the eldest granddaughter, I should be home in the Philippines walking with her to the market, or taking her to mass or watching TV with her like Papang, God rest his soul, used to. Instead I'm here, living a life that I'm so grateful for, but wishing she could experience the same. I hope she knows how much I think of her.  And then there's my Nanay, my dad's mom, who lives a door away from me. Nanay's hilarious! She swears we starve if she's not the one feeding us! My sister and I used to hate it when we were on vacation and Nanay would ring the doorbell like crazy at 7:00 am to tell us to eat breakfast. After some coaxing, we're sitting at the counter eating the spam, eggs and fried rice she brought over cuz we can't sleep anymore. But that's Nanay. She lives for her children and grandchildren...and her TFC. She has seriously babysat all the children in our family (and some other people's families) because she's so excellent at taking care of everyone.  Simple lives, our grandmothers lead. Quiet and often subdued, they don't always appear to be doing or thinking much. But what would our lives be without them, the matriarchs of our society? Life would surely be in disarray.

        Getting to know...      ANDREW ALCALA BOQUIREN aka DREW/ANDY   (Actually I don’t call him ANY of those names, but others do. He’s just Andrew to me)  Vitals:  Met our sophomore year at UCI. We did a dance for PCN called pasigin, where the chicks were fish and guys were fishermen = 7 years and counting  Role In My Life:  Name Brand Whore…ha ha ha…I’m just kidding (Even though he admits to it!). To me, Andrew is a Model of Focus and Dedication – He is an all-around great guy who everyone loves. He's not only fun to be around, but he’s also goal-oriented as hell. He took classes while working full-time to satisfy requirements for architecture school. And then during this past year, his first year at the Southern California Institute of Architecture (aka SCIARC), he got up at the crack of dawn (literally) so he could go to campus early and work on his projects. All that hard work AND he still makes time to hang out with his family and friends (by appointment of course. Gotta pencil all of us into his planner, that’s how busy he is!)!  Good Times:  Oh gosh, Andrew and I have a million and one inside jokes cuz of everything we’ve done together! Like when he offered to help me cook dinner at the apartment and said I could stir the soup (Who the heck are you, my mom? And what am I, 6 years old?!)…Or our late study nights with Leia and Jean at the Main Library in Irvine when we hardly did any studying…how about when we were walking through the “Chinatown” in London and this Kosovan little beggar girl was all hanging on Andrew’s bag asking for money (I think. She and her mom didn’t speak any English) and he (along with Cile, Fantone, Tommy and I) were all freaked out after…or the time we were hiking through the dark tunnels at Diamond Head in Hawaii and Andrew refused to take off his Gucci shades cuz he was scared he would drop them! Andrew's too much!  In his own words:  “The Queen Mum’s 99 today…we all know what’s gonna happen to her.” (We were at Buckingham Palace, well, in front of it, on the Queen Mum’s 99th birthday in August 1999)

       DEAREST GOOD-BYE   I love going to the airport...I love it when I'm standing by the gate looking out for the familiar face I'm supposed to be taking home with me. I love it when I'm packed and ready to add another entry into my travel journal of life. I love the anticipation I feel right before I get to sit and fasten my seatbelt. The only thing I hate about the airport is often having to say good-bye when I'm there.  We had to bid Jhoette farewell tonight. If you don't know who Jhoette is, he's one of my best friends and he's in the Philippines attending medical school. I swear it seems just like yesterday when we were all singing karaoke back in March upon Jhoette's arrival, looking forward to our plans during his stay. And today I had to hug him, say I LOVE YOU, and then say good-bye.   None of us got choked up when he stood up from the table, grabbed his backpack and motioned for us to walk with him. Not one of us shed any tears as he showed his ticket and passport to the guard by the terminal entrance. No one uttered a disparaging remark as we walked away, knowing it would be 2 years before we'd see Jhoette's face again.   We didn't show much disdain this evening; instead choosing to joke around like we usually do to keep the mood light. Maybe it's because we were trying to deal with it all as best we could, hoping to stay, or even just become optimistic. But if you observed closely enough, you could see the heaviness that fill our hearts. It's not the greatest feeling you could feel. In fact it can be a little painful. It's a real mystery how a heart can tell when you're feeling sad, alone or angry.  I pray for the safety and success of my friend. I pray that with these great sacrifices will come greater rewards. I just wish this sacrifice didn't take Jhoette so far away. 1 year and 10 months...the countdown to his return begins now...

        Getting to know...      CHERYL LYNN ZARASPE KAGAOAN aka Che    Vitals:  Met in freshman year religion w/ Mrs.-I-have-a-ring-in-every-finger-and-my-blonde-hair’s-all-crazy Rizzo at Immaculate Heart High School. Cheryl thought I was Japanese = 12 years and counting.  Role In My Life:  Re-appearing Never Disappearing Friend – Keeping old friends when you start college is a true testament of exactly how strong those bonds that were formed in high school really are. When us IH pandas (Yeah Pandas, so what?!) started college in 1996, many of us thought not much would change, regardless of how scarce our meetings would be. But everyone knows what happens when high school’s done and college begins…things change. Suddenly the phone calls, lunches and parties happen less often and you feel a certain feeling of loss and regret. What happened to the eternal sisterhood we learned to rely on? THEN you see that old friend again, maybe after months or even years, and it’s as if no time had passed. Sisterhood has prevailed! That’s how Cheryl and I are.   Good Times:  I used to have a crush on this one guy when we were in high school and he came to one of our school dances during our junior year. It was either the Welcome Dance (which is our first dance of the school year) or the Valentine’s Dance. Anyhow, we were all dancing the whole night and I kept telling myself, if this guy isn’t dancing during the last song, I’LL ASK HIM. I’m really bad at stuff like this so here comes the last song, “Somebody” by Depeche Mode, and I’m squirming, still trying to decide if I’ve got the guts to go through with it. He’s standing like 5 feet away from me, and so is Cheryl. I just heard Cheryl say, “Man I love this song!” and next thing I know, my crush is leading her to the dance floor. WAY TO GO ANNA! Cheryl spent the entire ride home apologizing to me. Ha ha ha…It’s okay Cheryl. I’m slow.  In her own words:  “I don’t know what the big deal is with Lord of the Rings. Ok, so there’s a wizard named Randolf.” Ha ha ha…GANDALF SILLY!!  ***This girl just turned 26 on May 16th! BELATED HAPPY BIRTHDAY CHERYL!!!!***

       I LOVE THIS GAME!   So I know it’s been over 12 hours since the Derek Fisher’s shot, but since I got home last night up until the 45 minutes I had to get ready this morning, I’ve watched that replay over and over again. And then last night when I went downstairs to the kitchen to get some water before bed, I still had this desire to see that game-winning shot just one more time. It turned out ESPN was replaying the whole game and as sleepy as I was, I sat there and watched practically the whole first quarter…again, excited because I knew how that game was gonna end.   There’s nothing like being a fan – of anything and anybody. Last night there was some tiffin’ goin’ on cuz Joe was rooting for the Spurs in a room full of Laker fans. As good-natured as his taunting was, it still got to the very gut of us Laker fans and when Tim Duncan’s shot went in, and Joe stood up (PREMATURELY of course) in victory, all of us just wanted to pounce him with a vengeance (Joe are you laughing cuz I am). Funny I know, but what’s fanaticism without passion and pride right? Especially SPORTS fanaticism! There’s no fan like the sports fan. And in this city, there’s no fan like a Laker fan!  I found the following article by a writer named Eric Neelon on ESPN.COM. It’s a model article for what everyone was feeling last night:   LIVIN’ LA VIDA LAKERS    By Eric Neel  Page 2   The second -- the four-tenths-of-a-second -- it was over, I called my buddy Wes. His little girl Ella was screaming in the background, apparently dancing around their Pasadena living room like a lottery winner.   "I gotta call you back," he said. "Ella's kind of losing it right now."  We hung up and I waited for the call back, staring at the phone, bouncing my knees like a meth addict hungry for a fix. Fisher's shot, the whole last 12 seconds of Game 5, wouldn't be real to me until I relived them with him.   My cell rang and I flipped it open to hear him laughing on the other end. The kind of laugh that comes with knee slaps and head shakes. The kind of laugh you laugh when the girl, against all odds, says yes.   "Four-tenths isn't even technically possible, is it?," I asked. "I thought it had to be at least six-tenths."   "I almost feel bad for the Spurs fans," he said. "I mean I don't, but it's as close as I'll ever come."   "Yeah ... the poor bastards," I said.   And he laughed again.   And then we just sat on the phone for a while, watching the replays on TVs a couple hundred miles apart, not saying anything, worried that somehow we'd kill the feeling, or that the gods would swoop down and take the shot away from us.   We weren't 36-year-old dads with mortgages. We were geeked-out kids itching to find a ball and a court.   I swear, if you don't love the NBA playoffs, I don't want to know you. If you don't love the way the Spurs and Lakers went at it like Ali and Frazier for 47-plus minutes, trading roundhouses and body-blows, I got no use for you.   Yeah, it was an ugly game, sometimes almost too ugly to watch; but you couldn't turn away from it because there was so much bleeding, beating heart out there.   Shaq and Duncan gave up their offensive games to give each other forearm shivers and drive each other to the baseline. Fisher took charges and Bowen took 'em right back. Kobe, Ginobili, George, and Parker squeezed off shots in traffic. Nothing was cheap. Points came like bits of rock John Henry busted off the mountainside, one exhausting swing at a time.   Then came the Spurs comeback and the Lakers' two-for-forever drought.   I felt like I was Sherilyn Fenn in "Boxing Helena" just watching it, one body part after another cut away. Freaking torture. The world started collapsing during that stretch. First I'm in the fetal position, then I'm in the womb, then I'm a dividing cell, and finally I'm a speck of gene on some double-helix ride to the fiery pits of hell. If you don't think a stretch like that is the stuff of epic poetry and tragic novels, I pity you.   Then came Kobe's shot with about 11 ticks to go. He and Malone had worked effective double- and triple-pick sequences all night, but the others were tight fits. This one opened up like a swinging door. My first thought was that Kobe was too open, that he'd come into the shot with too much spring and push. But he dialed it back mid-flight and hit it.   The elation came in waves. It came up and out of the hole I was in for most of the rest of the quarter. It carried with it all the clanging rims that came before it.   More than that, it carried with it the whole weird Laker saga. Phil's future was in it. The way he and Kobe have never clicked was in it. And the lifetime of hunger GP and Malone bring every time they lace up was in it in spades.   The Spurs are a great team and Duncan is a helluva player. But they've got nothing like the drama the Lakes do.  That's part of why Duncan's fadeaway was such a killer. Brilliant as it was, it felt cheap and lucky. It felt unfair. Frivolous. Like it was just there to spite me, to mock my Laker heart. I couldn't respect it. I could only hate it.   And hating it made me sick to my stomach. I wanted to cry. I wanted to break something. And if you don't see that, and if you've never felt that, and if the NBA playoffs don't do that kind of thing to you, I just don't get you.   Because even on a night when there was more slugging than flowing, even on a night when the game was miles away from its smooth creativity and lyrical genius, in the end, the game hung there, swinging wildly from sorrow to joy and back to sorrow again in fractions of a second. It turned me to mush. It made me feel invincible. And it leveled me like Wile E. Coyote under an anvil.   And that's where I thought it would end. That's the call I thought I'd be making to Wes. The commiseration call. The bitter kids, cursing the fates and smack-talking Duncan in the feeble hope it'd take away the sting.   But then there was Derek, and a ball I can't believe he caught, let alone shot, let alone put in.   And then there was that blissed-out call to Wes and a feeling that mainlined from tonight through Horry in '02 to Magic in '87 to Jerry West from half-court in '70.   I swear, if you think the NBA playoffs are too long, or too slow, or too ugly, you're dead to me.   But if you're with me on that phone tonight, or even if you're sitting somewhere in San Antone, doing the commiseration thing, smack-talking Fisher's lucky ass, and cursing mine ...  You're my friend for life.    (Eric Neel is a regular columnist for Page 2. His "On Baseball" column will appear weekly during the baseball season.)   ** ALL this AND I get to watch TROY tonight? SWEEET!

       D-FISH IN THE HOUSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!   OH MAN!!!!!!!!!!! I CAN'T FREAKIN' BELIEVE IT!!!!!!!!! WOOOOOOO HOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!! Most of us were at Ocean Seafood Restaurant in downtown to celebrate Rochelle's graduation from pharmacy school (YOU GO DR. GALACE!!). She was so worried that the Lakers would lose and everyone would suffer from indigestion. But oh was she wrong! I can't say I'm not ticked that they lost a 16-point lead. That's how they play so I'm not even surprised that happened. I'm glad things turned out the way they did.  So...let's pray for Saturday night. Will the Lakers do for the Spurs what the Spurs did to them LAST post season, left Kobe Bryant in tears? Or will the Lakers prevail and get closer to yet another championship? We shall find out in due time I suppose, but a little prayer never hurt anyone right?

       LAWYER MEETS AN OFFICER & A GENTLEMAN   On a rainy Saturday last month, Ate Tin-Tin and I attended the wedding of one of our elementary school friends, formerly known as Michelle Anne Chiongson (I know I know, wedding 568,000 for me it seems like!). Anyhow, Michelle is 3 years older than me and I’ve known her since she was president of our student council at good ol’ St. Francis of Assisi and I was lucky enough to have her as a “schoolmate” when we got to Irvine. I’ve looked up to this girl for as long as I can remember. She’s just always been so mature for her age. I’ve never seen her overreact, become emotionally distraught or get worked up about anything. On her wedding day, rainy and windy as it was, Michelle was as calm as I’ve ever seen her. She carried on with the composure and confidence of the lawyer that she is, while her new husband, Wakonda, nicknamed Rook (got it when he was a marine) was as content as a man could be on his wedding day.   I’ve been to more than my share of weddings in the last 2 years, and I’d have to say that this was one of the most stress-free wedding days I’ve witnessed (next to my Ate Cheryl’s Boston wedding last May). Despite the fact that 2 maids of honor (one of which was Anne, who’s been Michelle’s best friend and a good friend of mine since St. Francis as well) and 2 bridesmaids had to help Michelle carry her dress across the parking lot to the church, despite the rain and clouds that covered the skies during the ceremony, and despite the unruly wind that forced the photographer to anchor Michelle’s veil to a bed of flowers during the pictorials, the day was nothing short of wondrous for our new Mr. & Mrs. Robertson.    I can’t tell you how happy I am for my good friend and her new hubby. Rook is one of the nicest guys you could meet. He’s always smiling and I can tell how happy he and Michelle are going to be. I’m so excited for them, especially Michelle, whose solo of O LITTLE TOWN OF BETHLEHEM at our Christmas program way back in 1988 is something I still haven’t forgotten. She’s the first close friend I’ve had who’s gotten married and it’s been a real pleasure to have witnessed everything she’s experienced since our school days together. Pictures soon to come!  So kids…who’s next? Any takers?

        Getting to know...      PATRICK Y. BALLESTEROS aka PAT    Vitals:  Met our freshman year at UCIrvine. Pat started out as just our friend’s dormmate, but ultimately turned into OUR good friend and Cile’s art major guardian angel in Irvine (“C’mon Cile, we can’t ditch class today.” Ha ha ha…). Cile and Pat, with their art classes, projects and field trips, were literally each other’s shadow for 5 years and lucky me, being Cile’s roommate, got to spend as much time with Pat as she did = 8 years and counting  Role In My Life:  The Talented Mr. Ballesteros – I can’t even begin to tell you how talented this boy is at his craft. Whether it’s painting on a canvas, drawing in his sketchbook (which he NEVER EVER goes anywhere without), or getting creative with his I-Book sketchpad, Pat’s the real deal. It really makes me wish I had such a gift.  Good Times:  On Valentine’s Day in 2000, we opened the door to our apartment (WE meaning me, Cile, Leia, Fantone, Isa, and probably some of the other girls) and there on a chair before us were a dozen roses. It was from Pat for all of us chicks. Those of us who didn’t have boyfriends suddenly forgot for a few minutes how cursed that day usually is for us. Thanks Pat! What a sweetie!  In his own words:  “Sorry Anna, I don’t know how this coffee maker works and I don’t know where ANYTHING is in this kitchen. I never come in here!” (Pat and his mom just moved into a new house a few months ago and I was gonna make some coffee and I asked him where the cream, sugar, measuring spoons, etc were and he just gave me this blank look the whole time! Spoiled!

       MOM'S DAY   Today is Mother's Day, the day of the year dedicated to the honor and appreciation of the women who tucked us into bed, made our lunches, took care of us when we were ill and probably the one of the most, if not THE MOST important female role model in our lives.  I love my mom, as I'm sure you all love yours. From the day I was born 26 years ago, and when Tin was born almost 14 years ago, I know that, along with my dad, my mom has done nothing but assure the safety and well-being, not to mention happiness of their daughters. My sister and I are always #1 with mom. Tin and I roll our eyes when my mom makes comments about how pretty we are in a certain outfit or how nice our new haircut looks cuz we think getting compliments from mom is corny. But we realize quickly thereafter that her opinion means more to us than we make it seem.  Yes my mom and I have had our share of spats (who hasn't?) and there are times when I think she'll never understand what I'm feeling or she'll never stop nagging me about everything. But the honest truth is, moms know more than we often give them credit for and as much as we try to argue or fight the fact that our moms are this or that, we all know inside that we're destined to become exactly like them someday. I know that a big part us wishes that growing up to be half the loving caregiver and friend that mom is, or was, would be a privilege.  I hope that everyone has had a chance to remember their mom today, whether she's in heaven or right in the next room. We don't have to wait for the 2nd Sunday in May to let mom know we love her.

       AN EVENING IN SD...   A bunch of the peeps and I are here in lovely San Marcos at the home of our buddy, Patrick Ballesteros. Since we were unable to go camping this year, we decided a day or 2 out of town, anywhere, would be a cool consolation. I could've waited until I got home to blog about this but I thought I'd start right now and continue when I get home. The drive was quite nice, hardly any traffic. Iya offered to take her car so I rode in the back with Jhoette behind the steering wheel and Iya sitting shotgun. We followed Edwin's car, who had Cahlo and Matt as passengers. Listening to slow jams as we discussed our lives (what ELSE do we ever do?), the trip seemed much shorter than it was.   Pat's new house is beautiful! His mom even cooked dinner for us...mmmm...we headed to the pool after dinner to watch Edwin, Matt and Cahlo mess around with all the swimming pool equipment. GEEZ THESE BOYS! CAN'T FREAKIN' TAKE THEM ANYWHERE!!! Tomorrow we're headed to the outlets and then the beach. Until Sunday...

        Getting to know...      TERESITA CLAMOR CASTANEDA aka TERRY    Vitals:  Met our junior or senior year in high school. Terry (and her twin sis Chary) were friends with one of my classmates and then we were roommates for 3 years at UCI ~ 9 years and counting  Role In My Life:  Model of Independence and Devotion – I’ve always been amazed at Terry’s will when it comes to her family, her career and her friends. I used to worry about her when something in her life wasn’t the way she wanted it to be. But I learned quickly that I had nothing to be concerned about because Terry knew how to deal with issues, learn from them and move on from there. She hardly has to depend on anyone’s help and she doesn’t complain about it either. And in the midst of her busy life, she still finds time to call me when she’s driving to catch up. Everyone should know someone like Ter.  Good Times:  When Terry was pledging for her sorority, Kappa Zeta Phi, she was occupied practically everyday and every night with meetings and events. On Thursdays, she was usually at an event that involved some serious partying and she came home giggly and faded. It just so happened that during the quarter she pledged, I only had classes and work from Monday through Thursday. This was a blessing in disguise. One Friday morning, Terry had a really bad hangover and I woke up cuz she needed me to call in sick for her. After I called her work, I helped walk her to the bathroom to pay homage to the porcelain god. After a few minutes of not hearing anything, I knocked, “Terry are you okay?” She practically crawled out of the bathroom and just sat there on the floor (our sink is separate from the toilet and shower). She was like, “Anna can you just get my pillow so I can lie down here?” I was like, “No Ter, you have to get to bed. Here I’ll help you.” But she insisted so I grabbed her pillow, gave it to her and she fell asleep there on the floor by the bathroom. Oh Ter, I miss nursing your hangovers!  In her own words:  “It’s because they think we have boyfriends already and that’s why guys don’t approach us.” Terry’s philosophy of why we didn’t have boyfriends (This was during our junior year at UCI)

       UNSUNG HEROES   I did something dumb on the Monday before I left for Hawaii. I went to the bank after work to withdraw some dinero to take on my trip. There was only 1 space left on that whole first floor at the Wells Fargo lot and it HAD to be next to this huge ass Camry that parked, not only on HIS space, but inched right into the empty space next to it…the space I was going to try to get into. So, I’m trying to be all careful, moving ever so slowly when I heard this noise come from the front of the car. I thought I had run over a plastic bottle or something. When I got out of the car, ‘lo and behold, there were streaks of yellow paint on the left side of my bumper because I scraped against the stupid pole! Aaaaaaaahhhhh!!! It looked much worse than it really was. None of Raven’s paint (that’s my car’s name, Raven – Raven the Rav 4…ha ha ha…) was harmed. All the paint streaks came from that stupid yellow pole. Something like this ALWAYS happens to me before I leave for a trip. Before I left for England in 1999, my wallet was stolen; before I left for DC, I got into a really bad car accident; before I left for Hawaii LAST year, I ran over that freeway rail that punctured a hole in my oil tank and my front right tire. And then now this. But I learned in the last year not to overreact about stuff like this so I’m like, it’s ok, when I get back from Hawaii, I’ll clean it up and it’ll look just fine.  When we were driving to work last Tuesday morning, I suddenly remembered that that had happened the day before and I was telling my mom how I felt so sorry for my car. Then my mom says, “oh, daddy fixed it already.” When we got to the garage at work, I looked at my bumper and it was as if nothing happened. My dad had spent the night before cleaning it up. That’s just like my dad, always doing things for us and never waiting for acts or words of gratitude. I love my dad! I felt awful this past Sunday, Father’s Day, because I was in Hawaii, unable to celebrate the day designated to honoring the men who woke up in the middle of the night for midnight feedings, the one who sang and rocked us to sleep, the one who sterilized our bottles, the proxy who awkwardly tried to fix our hair before school if mom was sick, the family caretaker who stands in a shadow often to give mom most of the glory.  I don’t think dads get enough appreciation in this world. On tv, in movies, it’s always the dad who abandons the mom and the children and it’s always the dad who has the affair. Not all dads are this way but that’s how it appears sometimes, doesn’t it? When it’s Mother’s Day, you know it because the malls and restaurants are filled with signs reminding us and cable is chockfull of made-for-tv movies about moms. But when it’s Father’s Day, you see a sign here and there, and hardly anything on tv giving dad the recognition he deserves. Maybe it’s just me, but it’s only because I love my dad so much and I wish he got as much attention as mom does sometimes.   Here’s to all of our dads, on earth and in heaven! And to honor this most important male influence in my life, here’s…    Getting to know…      FORTUNATO D. GONDA, JR. aka DADDY    Vitals:  Met when I was born cuz he was there! = 26 years and counting  Role In My Life:  The Best Dad Ever – Not only is my dad the typical patriarch of the family, who drives us everywhere, pays the bills and makes sure the cars are always in good health, he’s also the epitome of Mr. Mom. Every Friday when I get home from work, the washing machine and dryer are already running cuz Dad likes to end the week with laundry. He does this well into early Saturday morning, after which he spends a good part of the afternoon folding everything (unless my sister and I…well, unless I run into a basket and fold it myself).   Good Times:  Sometimes I feel bad that my dad didn’t have any sons. Both of his brothers have sons and sometimes I feel like my dad kinda wishes he had at least ONE to carry on the family name and to do guy things with. So my sister and I do what we can to help the situation. On some Saturday mornings, my sister will get up early to play basketball or tennis with my dad. I try to watch as many basketball games on tv with my dad as I can. It’s fun watching Laker games together. We get angry and yell at stupid plays and bogus foul calls and get excited, hi-fiving each other when Kobe can’t miss. Who needs a son when you’ve got 2 daughters who love their dad right?  In his own words:  “Ok, Leng, just call me on my cellophone.” – Ha ha ha…I think he got telephone and cell phone mixed up. Oh dad...

       BACK TO THE MAINLAND   I spent 8 days in lovely Hawaii, on the wonderful island of Oahu and it wouldn't be enough to say what a great time I had. I couldn't possibly relay every detail about the trip to you all, but here's a list of things we did each day:   Day 1: June 17, 2004, Thursday  -Arrived in Honolulu at 11:20 am -Checked in at the Aston Coral Reef -Lunch at International Marketplace -Fun in the Waikiki waters -Dinner and drinks at Dukes   Day 2: June 18, 2004, Friday  -Diamond Head (or according to Ryan, "Mountain Head") hike -Lunch at Ono's -Dole Plantation -Sunset Beach (for like 5 minutes because of the high tide warning) -Waimea Beach -Dinner at Cheeseburger Paradise   Day 3: June 19, 2004, Saturday  -Pearl Harbor - Arizona Memorial -Aloha Bowl Swap Meet -Feng Shui Club at the Hyatt Regency   Day 4: June 20, 2004, Sunday  -Mass at St. Augustine -Brunch on the Beach @ Kalakawa Street -Lunch with Randy's relatives in Pearl City -Matsumoto's -Kuhio Beach (where we experienced some near-drownings. I'll have the victims tell you about that one) -Walked around and had a late dinner at the Int'l Marketplace   Day 5: June 21, 2004, Monday  -Malasadas from Leonard's Bakery...mmmmmmm -Maka Pu'u Beach -Kailua Beach -Lunch @ L & L -ATVing at Kualoa Ranch (where Jurassic Park and 50 First Dates was filmed) -Giovanni's Shrimp Truck -Mai Tai Bar   Day 6: June 22, 2004, Tuesday  -Shopping all day (Ala Moana Shopping Center), some peeps went mopedding -Paradise Cove Luau -Singles spend the evening to the morning on the beach   Day 7: June 23, 2004, Wednesday  -Snorkeling at Hanauma Bay -More shopping at int'l marketplace and Local Motion -Dinner @ Tiki Bar & Grill -Threw leis back into the ocean   Day 8: June 24, 2004, Thursday  -Got ready to head back home =( -Last minute shopping at Int'l Marketplace -Flight at 1:15 pm -Landed at LAX at 9:39 pm  I wish I could go back and not have to deal with the realities of our lives here, like work, school and other issues. We all wish we could stay and loaf around Hawaii a little longer and sadness doesn't begin to describe how we feel about leaving. But Matt told us all something our last night in Hawaii and it's really stuck since we got home: Don't cry because it's over. Smile because it happened.

       TINY BUBBLES   Hey kids! If you don't already know, a bunch of us are leaving for Hawaii on Thursday, June 17th and coming back June 24th, next Thursday. I'm sure you'll get to read at least 5-6 different perspectives of the trip when we get back. Check out the Hawaii blog (See "Mahalo Time" link on the side) we've been maintaining since January to find out what we'll be doing while we're there.  Until next time, ALOHA!

       IT'S OKAY...   The Lakers aren't the champions this year? Really? Yeah, no parade in downtown LA this year. No shot of Kobe and the trophy in a loving embrace. No Phil Jackson getting doused with champagne in the locker room. No Lakers jumping up and down in the hallways. Tonight (okay fine the whole series), Detroit outplayed our boys and for some reason, as crushed as I am, it's okay. And I'm only okay with this for one reason and one reason only: Coach Larry Brown finally got his ring and I think it's about time. He deserves it.  Sorry Karl and Gary. Your plan was unsuccessful and I guess you'll have to retire without that ring on your hand. Now the Lakers can try to get it together this summer. Shape up the shapeless, enhance the bench's reliability, shoot a hundred freethrows daily, get rid of the oldies and bring in the youth...and resign Kobe. There's the plan. We'll see what happens...next season...

        Getting to know...      CHRISTINA ELLEN G. BAUTISTA aka CHRISSY    Vitals:  Been cousins since I was born, but got more acquainted the Summer of 1998 at our family reunion in Ohio (at their house) = 26 years and counting  Role In My Life:  The Cousin You Love to Hang Out With – Chrissy is so fun to be around because, first of all, she seriously laughs at everything she sees and hears. She loves listening to me, my sister and my other cousins from California talk because she’s so amused by our expressions and slang. She’s so chill, often found with a smirk on her face. I feel so easygoing when I'm with this girl.  Good Times:  I spent the week in Ohio at my aunt and uncle’s house (Chrissy’s parents) back in 1998 after a family reunion. Before I had met Chrissy and her sister Melissa, all I knew were that they were kinda quiet and reserved, so I was a little apprehensive about meeting them because I’m so NOT quiet. They live in Maumee, OH, which is a pretty quiet city a few minutes away from the next big city, Toledo. We didn’t do a whole lot of sight-seeing, but we did what we could to amuse ourselves. One day, Chrissy and I were bored, so we found some cake mix and some chocolate mouse mix and decided we were gonna bake a cake. Suffice it to say it wasn’t Duncan Hines or Betty Crocker. #1, we forgot to grease the pan so the cake fell apart when we tried to take it out and put it on a plate. #2, chocolate mouse does not equal chocolate icing, so the consistency was…well, it wasn’t icing. So for dinner that night we served fragmented cake with hardened chocolate mouse on top. I don’t even think we cooked the chocolate mouse correctly. And then to top THAT off, we found some cherries that we scattered in a pattern on the cake thinking it would make it better. It didn’t.  In her own words:  “Hey, let's go somewhere I can see some lowriders.” – Chrissy on her last visit to LA

       IS THIS THE LITTLE GIRL I CARRIED?   My sister has just become a member of the great St. Francis of Assisi alumni group. I can't believe Tin just graduated from elementary school! I CAN'T I CAN'T I CAN'T!! It really seems like 5 minutes ago when we were in the hospital the day she was born in 1990, waiting for the nurse to wheel her out to the window of the nursery so I could see her. HAIR! That's all i saw! She was 19 1/2 inches in length and weighed 7 lbs and 13 oz when she was born and I'm almost sure that 1 lb of that was just her hair.   Anyhow, that was almost 14 years ago. My baby sister is a baby no longer and I'm so proud of the young lady she's become. You should've seen her and her classmates yesterday. Young adults with that tiny ounce of teenage angst mixed in. All the girls looked so beautiful and all the boys looked so handsome. It was hard to picture they were ever 5 years old, performing Frosty the Snowman for the Christmas program when they were in kindergarten. Oh when she went to get her diploma I wanted to jump up and down for her. And then when she got called for Third Honors, I wanted to scream out even more.   After the ceremony, Iya, Riann and I followed my sister to the classroom to help get her things together and to help her pass out the leis we made for her classmates. That morning was filled with so much energy and joy that I know none of these new graduates wanted it to end. I can still remember feeling that way 12 years ago when I graduated from St. Francis, and I know all of you will agree. There are all these emotions flying through your body because you're happy you're finally done with elementary school, you're sad because you'll miss your friends, you're excited about starting high school, and you're scared because you don't know what this new life will be like. I could see all of that in each of my sister's and friends' eyes. But oh how much bigger their world will become!  Later that day we had a small party for my sister. Mom and Dad outdid themselves, again, with all the food and preparations. We had some magic mic entertainment from Riann & Joe (of course, who else?) and had my nephew Kelsoe amusing us all day. It's a day I know Tin won't soon forget. A new milestone has been set...on to the next one...  I'm so excited for my sister! She's such a good kid and seeing her experience yet another accomplishment in her life overflows my insides with pride. I know people think I punk her a lot (actually not as much as Riann, but that's another story), but it's just sisterly banter, I promise. What are sisters for? She does the same thing to me. I think the 12-year age difference is a major factor. I'm like a 3rd parent to her.   Anyhow, I know that the next few years will be much different. She starts Providence High School in September and I'm just waiting for that day that she and I have it out because she missed curfew, or ran the cell phone bill, or used me as a taxi. My parents and I anticipate a wild ride to 2008. Holy crap! Next you know, she'll be graduating from high school!...And I'll be 30!.......But wait! She's NOT graduating from high school yet and I am certainly NOT 30 yet either...one at a time please. See pictures from this weekend on the side...

       LAST WEEKEND / THIS WEEK   So, no person of the week this week because I was busy studying for that final, but that’ll resume next week. Here’s what I’ve done these last 7 days. They’re divided into short entriettes:   Rootie Tootie Fresh ‘N Fruity, Please  - It was a busy weekend, this one that just passed. On Friday night I had dinner at IHOP with Matt, Randy, Iya and Carlo. How random, IHOP. Matt was craving this for some reason and invited me, Rrrrrandy, Iya, and Cahlo (our little SFA gang minus Jhoette) to join him in a pancake dinner. Weirdo!  We were all wondering for the longest time what to order and I mentioned I would be ordering an omelette. Iya, I guess in her confusion, asked if all the omelettes came with eggs…ha ha ha…she meant to ask if they all came with pancakes! Silly Iya! And Matt spent a good part of the dinner imitating Carlo’s laugh and Carlo spent the same amount of time trying NOT to laugh. Aww, miss that guys.   Shower of Babies  - On Saturday I spent the day in Chino Hills to help Iya with Ate Myla and Kuya Dennis’ baby shower. Baby Isabella is due…ummmm, in a couple of months I believe. Seems just like yesterday I was helping her with Ate Jenny and Kuya Francis’ baby shower and now Matty is almost 2 months old!!!! Oh he’s so cute, getting passed around just a little bit before finally finding comfort in the arms of his grandma, Tita Susie. He slept most of the time, cried a little bit, ate, got changed, and then slept some more. I’M SO JEALOUS OF BABIES’ LIVES SOMETIMES! What I would give to be fed, changed and sleep all day! Ate Myla and Kuya Dennis got a LOAD of presents, from a swing set, to a car seat, to clothes galore! Can’t wait to see Baby Isabella!   ESPN Zone  - After the shower, Iya and I headed towards Downtown Disney for Carlo’s farewell dinner at ESPN Zone. By the time we got there at around 9:20 pm (after I asked everyone to be there at 7:00 oops!), everyone was sitting out on the patio, half-faded, talking and laughing away as they waited for their food to arrive. (Thanks again for getting there early to wait for the tables Jerome!) After dinner, we hammed it up with pictures outside, then headed upstairs to play some games. I didn’t play much, actually not at all, because I was so busy taking pictures of everyone. I had the best time watching everyone! It’s like a Chuck E. Cheese for adults there! The highlight of the evening was probably that horseracing game. Oh man, talk about INTO IT! Just take a look at the pictures (they’re on the side). I got home at around 2:20 am or something. Suffice it to say, it was a long day, but a fun-filled one.   Sunday  - On Sunday I went to mass in the morning, started my laundry, and then managed to squeeze in a few hours of studying before I headed out to Khahloh’s house to watch the 1st half of the game. Then I headed back to my house to watch the 2nd half with my dad. Thank goodness because he needed someone to be angry with.   Please No More Good-byes  -  We all went to the airport on Wednesday night to see Cahlo off. We spent most of the evening sitting upstairs by McDonald’s, reminiscing a little about his stay, while trying to convince him to come back for Christmas. The farewell this year was nowhere near as heartbreaking for us as it was last year when he decided to leave. Not many tears were shed this time. Maybe because Cahlo held it in when it came time to hug each and every one of us. I’m not sure who was trying harder to be strong for whom. Sometimes you just can’t tell with him. He talks so little, if ever, that we’re often left guessing what he’s thinking and feeling. We’ve said so long, see you later to yet another friend who’s off to the Philippines to set up for his future. All we can do for them is pray and hope that everything works out the way they imagined.   Getting Leid  – Last night my mom, my sister, my ninang and I spent 4 ½ hours making leis for my sister’s classmates. My little sister is graduating from elementary school this Saturday. I CAN’T FREAKIN’ BELIEVE IT! Time flies! I’ll let you know how it all goes this weekend.  Until then, I’ll talk to you guys later!  Hawaii, 6 days and counting...

       SWEET RELIEF   In the words of Tupac, “I GOTTA SAY IT WAS A GOOD DAY.” That’s what I wanted to chant before I went to bed last night. Good days are so rare sometimes that you have to savor the few that are given to you. I finished my accounting final at 9:20 pm last night and I can’t tell you how happy I am…LIKE I CAN’T TELL YOU! All day yesterday I was pretty panicky, but I managed to steal some moments at work here and there to peek at notes, trying to re-familiarize myself with material I haven’t looked at since March. It was a cumulative final, 9 chapters of inventory systems, stocks, bonds, long-term/short-term assets, long-term/short-term liabilities and every type of financial statement you could think of. Anyone need me to figure out their working capital? Net income? Ha ha ha…ask me in a few months because I just don’t want to think about any of that for awhile. Man I forgot what it felt like to finish a final. I used to feel that sense of relief at least 3 times a year during college (December, March and June to be exact) and I love it! The completion of something - what a great feeling!  And to think that was only PART of what made me smile yesterday. THE LAKERS WON! (They should’ve won game 1, but that’s over and done with so I won’t dwell). I’m so mad I didn’t get to see it, but Matt was nice enough to text me at halftime and after the game. The first thing I did when I handed in my final was look at my phone and I saw it, LAKERS WIN! WOOOO HOOOO! (Thanks cuz!) Then I got to vent about the final to Iya on my way home (Thanks friend!). When I got home, I watched the recap with my dad and saw how 40 seconds was enough time for Detroit to lose a 6 point lead, how Kobe sank that 3 with Hamilton’s hand all up in his face and how Luke Walton, our rookie, put up some numbers to aid our team to victory. So proud of Luke and Kareem (who I fondly call Krush. K Rush, get it? Ha ha ha…)! You go boys! Karl and Gary who? I’m disappointed in those guys, but I won’t get into it for fear Joe will go off (although I see your point, homie).  And then, to make the evening even better, my printer didn’t print out pink-shaded pictures anymore! I’ve been fighting with this dang printer since Jhoette left (May HELLO!). But I put in a brand spankin’ new ink cartridge and that did the trick (I swear I tried that before and is still printed the pictures with pink people but it doesn’t matter now). Anyhow, I was wide awake to work on Carlo’s (ok fine, Khahloh’s) album last night because he’s leaving for the Philippines tonight. I’ll let you know how that goes after tonight…  More news on the weekend to come. It was funfilled to say the least!

       ASK AND YOU SHALL RECEIVE   I have my accounting final on Tuesday, June 8 and if you haven't heard me complain before, THIS CLASS HAS KICKED MY ASS ALL SEMESTER! I feel like such a whiner when I think of how trivial this test is compared to the pharmacy boards Rochelle has been studying for for months (Please pray for her!). But I'm asking you all to hope and pray that I do decently on this exam as well (Geez Anna, gimme gimme gimme!). I said I wasn't gonna stress because that makes the ability to study and retain information so much harder, so I'm taking it chapter by chapter...but some prayers wouldn't hurt right? Im seriously calling on all the possible help I can get (Hey Riann, can I borrow your guardian angel, Bruno tomorrow? ha ha ha...)  Thanks guys! At 10:00 pm Tuesday night, I will be a much happier lady...unless I decide to say SCREW THIS midway through, in which case I'll be a happier lady BEFORE 10. Okay, back to the wonderful world of stocks, bonds and merchandise inventories!!!

       FREAKIN' RANDOM   This is so random but it made me laugh out loud this morning and I thought I’d share it with you guys. The subject matter isn’t so funny because there are 2 people’s lives at stake. But the way the newscaster said it all was freakin’ hilarious to me.   So, this morning, while I’m curling my hair, the tv is on and I’m listening to the news. First they’re talking about Laci Petersen; apparently there’s some discrepancy as to what she was wearing the day she disappeared. The people at the salon claimed that she was wearing khaki pants when they last saw her, but when her body was found she was wearing BEIGE pants. Oh Lord, are you freakin’ kidding me with this “discrepancy?”  Anyhow, in relation to that, there is an 18-year old young lady who has been reported missing. She is also pregnant. The last place she was seen was at a café where she applied for a job. The last thing the reporter said was, “The father is not being considered as a suspect at this time BECAUSE HE’S IN JAIL!” And that just made me laugh out loud!  Ok that’s it…BACK TO WORK!!!

       BACK-BLOGGED   Gosh I haven't sat down to blog in quite a bit and it's all because of accounting crap, but I have all this stuff to catch up on. I'm gonna do a quick recap so bear with me, I'm a tad on the behind side:   MAY 1ST  (a freakin' month ago!): My nephew Kelsoe turned 1 year old! He looked adorable in his Baby Gap outfit! He took a nap before the party started so he was a bit on the cranky side, clutching to his daddy for a good part of the day. But we let him open a few of his presents and he was all about it!...See pictures on the side...  Later that night I attended my elementary school reunion. That's right, ELEMENTARY school. I was accompanied by my fellow St. Francis of Assisi crew, Iya, Randy, Carlo, Jhoette and Matt. We said we wouldn't pay money to go if we were just gonna see each other...which is exactly what happened. Aside from us, though, we did get to party it up with Stacy, Edwin, Ate Tin-Tin and Jeff. Bummed as we were that we didn't get to see our long-lost classmates, we made the best of the evening. Jhoette was all about leading the Achey Breaky. FREAKIN' HILARIOUS and definitely one of the highlights of my evening cuz he was SOOOOO into it...see pictures on the side...   May 13:  Rochelle our bobbers graduated from pharmacy school! It was a hot day in Pasadena but we made it through ok, taking hammy pictures after the ceremony, then enjoying a 10-course meal at Ocean Seafood Restaurant in Chinatown. Man was I full that night! Distracted by the game, Rochelle feared that should the Lakers lose that night, everyone would suffer indigestion and kill the high she was feeling from graduation. But we all know that's the night D-Fish pulled his 0.4 winning shot so it was all good! See pictures on side as well...   May 15/16/18:  I talked about Jhoette's departure on the 18th but I didn't mention the fun-filled weekend we had before he left. 3 Saturdays ago, we spent the day at Corona del Mar. What did we do? We played volleyball, ate, played some flag football, ate...played in the water...ate some more...it was just a great day to spend time with friends, old and new...and of course eat. We had fried rice, hamburgers, hot dogs, el pollo loco - we were pretty stacked! And then that night we had a bonfire complete with s'more-making. We don't do enough outdoorsy things. One can only take so much out of going to the movies, eating out and sitting at Coffee Bean and talking right? The night ended happily for all of us (except maybe Joe) when the Lakers kicked the Spurs to the curb in that series-deciding game. See pictures on the side...   The next day we had a despedida dinner at BJ's in Burbank for Jhoette. The evening was filled with drinks, laughter and just chillin' before the good-byes came to rain in on everything that week. Jhoette left the 18th....but you already knew about that.   May 22:   We celebrated Randy's birthday at Orchid...Restaurant, in LA. It's this fancy shmancy place where my crabcake appetizer cost $13. It didn't matter though cuz this place had a slammin' karaoke place above the restaurant. These rooms ARE PIMP (to use Riann's words)! The room we had was fit for 20 people (there were 10 of us I think) and there were a group of 9 screens, with 4 mics hanging from the ceiling over the lounge area. We sang everything from the BeeGees to Roselle Nava to freakin' U2 and Brian McKnight. Can't have the full-effect of karaoke without Miss Riann, and as usual, she monopolized the mics. Entertaining! See pictures on the side...   May 30:  Miss Larnie Boquiren graduated from Cal State Fullerton this weekend. Hot, so hot it was on that field where friendship games are usually held (Geez remember friendship games? Seems ages ago doesn't it?). Thank goodness for the covered areas with chairs. The evening was a wonderful celebration in her honor. Larnie's family did a great job planning the event cuz I know we all had an awesome time. From the program, which included Cile's endearing videowork and a How-well-do-you-know-your-brothers game Minette made up for our celebrant, to the dancing (great DJ!), it was non-stop fun that night. Saw some people I hadn't seen in a long time and that was the icing on the cake of an already joyous evening of celebration. Congratulations Larnie! See pictures on the side...  Thanks for reading. I have to go study for my final now. All that's getting me through everything is the 7 days in Hawaii I'm looking forward to. Mahalo Everyone and Take Care!

        QUALITY TIME...WITH ANNA   On Thursday afternoon at approximately 2:30 pm I was finally dismissed from jury duty after 3 days of service. I had to go back Wednesday at 1:30 pm because the lawyers and the judge were unable to finish questioning the first 18 prospective jurors on the stand. At 4:25 later that day, when the 12 jurors had finally been chosen, the judge advised us that they needed two altnernate jurors. Hence, therefore, thus, we were asked to come back Thursday morning at 10:30 am. We all got there that day and waited in the hallway until 11:55 am only to be told by the court clerk that we were being sent to lunch until 1:45 pm! At 2:00 pm we get in the courtroom, they question 5 more prospective alternate jurors and pick 2. I wasn't even sent to the panel for questioning. At 2:30 pm 5 of us were dismissed.  So I had a whole afternoon to myself after completing my jury service for the year. I really didn't mind all the waiting that this process involved. I basically read for 3 days, had lunch with Tita Cecile in Japantown and learned a plethora of information I probably wouldn't have learned had I not sat in that courtroom for 3 days. FYI, I have a new respect for lawyers. Can't even begin to imagine the amount of information they have to know and the weight of their jobs.  After I left the courthouse, I decided that the afternoon was much too precious to waste sitting at home napping or watching tv, so I walked a block down to see the Cathedral because in the year or so since it's been built, I never found the time to visit. I went to the gift shop first then headed to the church. WOW PRETTY!! I have to admit that at first glance, I wasn't really feeling the atmosphere there. Everything just seemed so streamlined and modern that it didn't feel like a place for worship and prayer. When I think of church I think of pillars adorned with gothic sculptures of angels or shrines of saints lined up against the wall. But the cathedral did something I think is absolutely beautiful. If you haven't been there yet, on either side of the cathedral, there is a tapestry mural of saints and random people lined up for something. I found out later that the mural is called the COMMUNION OF SAINTS and they're all walking towards the altar. It's absolutely breathtaking.    I stayed there for about an hour, prayed the rosary and just took some time for myself. I can't remember the last time I had any silent reflection time. That afternoon I went to confession. We're advised to go at least once a month and I haven't gone since September 2003! I stayed for mass after that. I had lots of quality time with God that day too, didn't I? It was a good day to say the least. I feel like everything happened the way it was supposed to. I hope that if you're like me, caught in the whirl of obligations to everyone but myself, caught in more than a few issues you can't seem to find resolutions for, you'll find a day like I did to rediscover the peace we always seem to be looking for.

       Getting to know...  JOELLEE MAE VELASCO&nbsp;aka JOELS &nbsp;   Vitals:  Met some time in high school through mutual friends circa 1994 or 1995, but got more acquainted in college because she was in Irvine visiting her boyfriend all the time! ~ 10 years and counting&nbsp;   Role in My Life:  1st Client Ever&nbsp;– Joellee and her boyfriend Zandro are getting married next May 2005 and they asked me to be their wedding helper. I’m so flattered (and rather terrified at the same time) that they trust me that much to ask, considering wedding planning is still only an aspiration and not my expertise.   Good Times:  I went with Joellee to a bridal expo at the LA Convention Center and we were so overwhelmed with the 50 photographers, 40 florists, 30 bakeries, 20 invitation-makers, etc that when we got out, we both just kinda looked at each, glazed eyes and then she said, “ok, no more wedding talk for the rest of this day.”&nbsp;   In her own words:  “It’s like, when Trista was trying to choose between Charlie and Ryan. Even though she was having fun with Charlie, she was thinking of Ryan the whole time. That’s how I feel about these two dresses. I’m wearing this right now, but how come I’m thinking of the other one?”…Joellee debating between 2 wedding dresses.

       WE THE JURY...   You must love your job an awful lot (or maybe a little) to want to pass up an opportunity to sit on your fanny all day to read, write or just think. Or actually, in my case, I HATE my job so I'd kill for an opportunity to sit on my bum in a room full of strangers to read, write and think I'm probably the only person in this nation who leaps at the chance to have jury duty (at least while I'm at this job). I would rather do nothing all day in that jury room than sit in my office and listen to people yell at me over the phone. Besides, you can have lots of great quality time with yourself as you wait and see if your name will be called. In 7-8 hours today, I finished the last 120 pages of CONFESSIONS OF A SHOPAHOLIC, started a new book, wrote a poem, decided to pursue writing and accounting, had lunch with&nbsp;my&nbsp;Tita Cecile who works for the district courts across the street AND&nbsp;re-evaluated my life for the 7th time this year. Why do people hate jury duty?  The last time I had jury duty, we were dismissed at 3:30 pm. My name didn't get called for a panel at all. So today they tell us that we would get dismissed between 4:00 and 5:00 pm. 3:30 pm comes along and I'm actually looking forward to going home when they make that announcement that they're going to set up another panel for jury selection. 'Lo and behold, my names gets called, along with 35 other people and we head up to the courtroom. They only got through questioning 5 prospective jurors so we have to go back tomorrow. No work again for me tomorrow?...OKAY! I don't even have to be there until 1:30 pm so&nbsp;I&nbsp;get to sleep in! As Riann and Joe might say, "HOORAY!!!" If I don't get picked I'll let you all know everything!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

       THE WOMEN IN MY LIFE    Last Friday was no ordinary day. I spent 8 hours complaining in my head about how much I'd rather be somewhere else. I just wanted that day to end because I&nbsp; knew the coming evening would be eventful. Cile and I flew to San Jose that night to spend the weekend with the girls: Annie, Ate Tin-Tin, Fantone, Gwen, Terry, Isa, Leia and Larnie. We all stayed in Terry & Chary's castle of a house in Fremont. It's HUGE! Cile basically rounded out the whole weekend for us (read her blog for details cuz I’m too lazy to do a play-by-play. Thanks!)   But this weekend wasn’t just about sightseeing, shopping and having drinks with friends, it was about rebirth. It’s the rebirth you feel when you spend time with people you no longer have the privilege of interacting with everyday. It’s reliving all the wonderful moments you shared together for 5 years in 3 days. It’s not having to establish new levels of camaraderie because the old ones never wavered. That’s how I felt this past weekend with these girls. They’re such the reminders of how wonderful it is to have other women in your life.   I know there are a lot of women out there who aren’t as lucky when it comes to having other women friends. Maybe some are just too insecure or too competitive around other women to develop any type of friendship and I think that’s a real shame. I’ve got so many awesome chick friends! Some I’ve known forever and couldn’t bear to imagine my life without. Some I’ve known for a decade or so and can’t imagine the person I might’ve become had it not been for them. Some I’ve barely met but feel like I’ve known all my life. And then there are the women in my family who have not only been my role models, but my peers in life as well. My aunt sent me the following forward about girlfriends and it’s so on-point! Have a read:     When I was little, I used to believe in the concept of one best friend, and then I started to become a woman. And then I found out that if you allow your heart to open up, God will show you the best in many friends. One friend's best is needed when you're going through things with your man. Another friend's best is needed when you're going through things with your momma.&nbsp; Another when you want to shop, share, heal, hurt, joke, or just be. One friend will say let's pray together, another let's cry together, another let's fight together, another let's walk away together. One friend will meet your spiritual need, another your shoe fetish, another your love for movies, another will be with you in your season of confusion, another will be your clarifier, another the wind beneath your wings. But whatever their assignment in your life, on whatever the occasion, on whatever the day, or where ever you need them to meet you with their gym shoes on and hair pulled back or to hold you back from making a complete fool of yourself. Those are your best friends.&nbsp;   It may all be wrapped up in one woman, but for many it's wrapped up in several: &nbsp;One from 7th grade, one from high school, several from the college years, a couple from old jobs, several from church, on some days your mother, on others your sisters, and on some days it's the one that you needed just for that day or week that you needed a fresh perspective, or the one who didn't know all your baggage, or the one who would just listen without judging. Those are good girlfriends/best friends.&nbsp;   Men are wonderful, husbands are excellent, boyfriends are awesome, male friends are priceless but if you've ever had a real good girlfriend, then you know there's nothing like her! I thank God for girlfriends, those who honor intimacy, those who hold trust, and those who just get your back when you feel like life is just too heavy!&nbsp; Then there are those girlfriends who have the insight to know when you just need a swift kick in the butt and a firm, "Get over it!" Gotta love 'em. I thank God for girlfriends and the special bond we share that's unique to us. Whether it's words we've shared, prayers we've sent up, laughs, tears, phone calls, emails, shopping, movies, lunches, dinners, late night talks, afternoon talks, weekend talks, all the talking, talking, talking and the listening, listening, listening...whatever we have shared has created this bond.

       MY STAR   &nbsp;  Last night I went to Culver City to hug our dearest baby, Larnie farewell. She’s on her way to Mesa, Arizona as we speak because she’s been accepted into the master’s program at the Arizona University of Health Sciences. We tease Larnie a lot, about how messy, absent-minded and naïve she is, but I can’t talk enough about her focus and tenacity when it comes to something she’s truly passionate about (like her career in sports medicine and we can’t forget volleyball!). She may not be able to put make-up on properly to save her life, or fix her bed in the morning, but she can sure tend to the muscle aches and pains of a football team in the locker room with the greatest of ease.  &nbsp;  That’s Larnie, “My Star,” who not only fills the room with her 100-watt smile, but remains one of my brightest sources of inspiration. Good Luck, Larnie! Study hard and CLEAN UP YOUR MESS!  &nbsp;   LATE BIRTHDAY GREETINGS…&nbsp;     Belated Happy Birthday to Teresita “Terry” Castaneda, Joe “Beetch” De Los Reyes, and JOSH HARTNETT! Josh Hartnett turned 26 yesterday, July 21st. I wonder how he’s doing. I miss him! I think he feels neglected cuz I've been paying so much attention to Orlando. What do you think? (Wake up, Anna, wake up!)

        Getting to know...       KELSOE MAURIUS MADARANG GONDA      aka KELSITO, BEAN or just plain KELSOE     Vitals:  Been my nephew since he was a twinkle in his mommy and daddy's eyes, but met when he was only 12 hours old = 1 year, 2 months and cnounting   Role In My Life:  My Favorite Baby - I have bunches of nieces and nephews because I have a load of cousins. But they all live so far away from me that I don't get to spend much time with them or watch them grow up. But then, my cousin, Christian and his wife Tristin (who both live close by) had Kelsoe (who's my inaanak/godson) and let's just say the spoiling began. I love this baby so much! We all do! Just thinking about him makes me smile and seeing him brings the greatest joy to my world.   Good Times:  Kelsoe's a funny baby, with gags up the whazoo! When he hears music, any kind of music, he starts to dance, either bobbing up and down with hands at his side or rocking back and forth to "Toxic." He loves playing with anything that has buttons: the computer keyboard, the piano, remote controls, the doorbell (his personal favorite I think), cellphones. In fact, he was playing with my sister's cell phone today and managed to punch in a random code that locked her keypad for 8 hours. ha ha ha...   In his own words:  Picture us saying, "Kelsoe no! No touch, don't touch!"...Kelsoe's response: "Touch touch touch..."

       BITTERSWEET HELLO….BITTERSWEET GOOD-BYE   &nbsp;  I love that term, “bittersweet.” It’s like feeling pleasure and pain at the same time. This Kobe-Shaq thing has been the perfect example of this feeling for me. I know the last month or so has annoyed a lot of people no doubt, even/especially Laker fans. Iya asked me how I felt about the whole thing a few days before ESPN and Fox Sports were barraged with newsflashes and press conferences regarding deals made with the NBA’s free agents. But as big a basketball and Laker fan as I am, I couldn’t seem to form an adamant opinion about the situation. Am I glad Shaq’s gone? Hell no! I’m gonna miss the big man, the player no coach or peer had an answer for (except maybe this year, Larry Brown). But at least he’s got his castle of a house in Orlando, not too far from Miami so I’m thinking he’s not doing THAT bad.  &nbsp;  Am I glad Kobe’s staying? I’m a Kobe fan, of course I’m happy! I know he’s got a lot to work on, especially when it comes to his image (oh man, why the infidelity, Kobes?). But I’ve got faith in people I’m a fan of. Call it unconditional fanaticism! I’m disappointed in his choices, but people forget he’s a 25-year old young man, with the world on his shoulders and the greatest abilities to make mistakes he will no doubt regret his whole life long. Yes I miss those Adidas commercials which showed Kobe writing in his journal or exercising his Italian; and of course those McDonald’s commercials with the little kids who asked him to be part of their team for the championship game. I miss THAT Kobe and I wish he hadn't gone to Colorado last summer. But I believe him when he says he feels guilty (cuz he SHOULD feel bad!) and I know he knows that he’s going to spend a great part of his lifetime trying to convince people he’s a better man than that. Here’s hoping his choices this year bring him more fortune (Aside from the disgusting $130+ million for the next 7 years) than disaster.  &nbsp;  And then there’s GP, who’s decided to stay and attempt to get that ring he’s so hungry for. All I gotta say is, “Fine Gary, you can stay…but make your presence felt, know what I mean?”   Ok kids, I’m off to Northern Cali with the Annie, Ate Tin-Tin, Fantone, Cile, Gwen, Isa, Leia and Larnie to for some bonding before Miss Maria Larnie Alcala Boquiren heads to Arizona for grad school. Have a safe weekend everyone! If you’re partying, make sure you’ve got a DD!

        Getting to know...      MELISSA ANN G. BAUTISTA aka MEL    Vitals:  Been cousins since she was born, December 1978, but became more acquainted when I spent the week at her house in Ohio = 25 years and counting (Chrissy’s younger sister)  Role In My Life:  Bright & Smiley Cousin – When you meet this girl, the first thing you’ll notice about her is that she’s smiling. In the few occasions that Mel and I have gotten a chance to hang out, all we do is laugh - at other people, at our family…at ourselves. Her smile is what I remember most often when I think of her. Even when we talk on the phone I can tell she's smiling.   Good Times:  One day when I was in Ohio,  Mel, Chrissy and I took their dog, Orson (who looks like a big yorkshire terrier), God rest his soul =),  and Buck (this huge brown doggie who is bigger than me I think), their friend’s pet, to the park for a walk. Chrissy drove, I sat shotgun and Mel rode in the back with Orson and Buck. Suffice it to say, the 15 minute drive to the park was nothing short of comedic. Mel sat between the two dogs, trying her hardest to control their excitement. Buck spent practically the entire ride fussy and gung-ho, licking Mel’s face constantly. When we finally got to the park, (mind you I have practically zero encounters with animals, rare or domestic) Mel and Chrissy handed ME Buck’s leash. This dog took ME for a walk!  In her own words:  “Leng, you're so small you could fit in my pocket!…Hurry get in!”

       BAUTISTA BONANZA 2004   That's what we called this past weekend's events in Charlotte, North Carolina. Since 1993, my Bautista side has hosted a family reunion like clockwork. We began in Burbank in December of 1993, then San Francisco in 1996, Maumee/Toledo, Ohio in 1998, Long Beach in 2000, Chicago in 2002 and then this year in "the South." We have it every 2 years and it's something that I look forward to during the odd numbered years.  When I got home from Hawaii 2 weeks ago, all I could think of was how much I missed being there and, oh crap, I have to fly to Charlotte this weekend and I still have to do laundry and pack...AGAIN! I was so dead tired after Hawaii that getting excited for the family reunion was something I practically missed out on. It wasn't until I saw my cousin, Ben, at the airport Friday morning that I realized how hard it was gonna be to leave when the weekend was over.  Charlotte, NC is a beautiful city! I spent the week of Thanksgiving there in 2000 after my internship in DC was done and I was nothing short of amazed at how clean and fresh it is there. No overpasses for freeways! In fact, there were times when I didn't even KNOW we were on a highway because the area is just surrounded by trees! The city's practically brand new, with all the new homes being built.  Anyhow, I digress. I'm not supposed to be blogging about Charlotte. I'm supposed to be blogging about my family. If only I could find the right words to describe how much I love everyone! It amazes me that every 2 or so years, we have this family reunion where my relatives from all over the US (and sometimes the Philippines) travel long distances to spend a couple days, sometimes just a day, together and then go back home. To spend $200-$400 for a plane ticket to a place you're only gonna be for 2 days is priceless to me. But that's how we are, how all families are, dedicated and loyal to the maintenance of our camaraderie and legacy, and I love it.  I love how my mom and my aunts and uncles reminisce about their childhood in the randomest of moments. I love how my aunts and uncles can joke around with the younger folk without causing any misunderstandings. I love the family gossip that people think only THEY know but really, the whole family knows. I love having so many nieces and nephews (kisses Jeremiah & Rosalyn!!). I love how my cousins and I don't see each other for 2 years, hanging by only a few phonecalls and e-mails in between meetings, yet still manage to uphold one of the strongest bonds I know: a friendship.   Aside from the humidity and rain this past weekend, everything, to me, was perfect. We got to meet my cousin's fiance who was nothing but sweet and charming. Alan & Stephanie are getting married in February! We had a fine dinner at my Auntie Nini's house on Friday night. On Saturday afternoon, we had an indoor "picnic" at a community center, which was followed by an evening of more eating, talking and magic mic'ing in the adjoining suites at the Double Tree Hotel. On Sunday we went to mass at St. Vincent de Paul (There was a hilarious announcement article in the bulletin that I will share with y'all after this entry - oh geez, did I just say Y'all?!). A bunch of us went shopping at the mall across the street, and then went back to the hotel rooms to get changed for the banquet that evening. The banquet was excellent. Lots of performances (YOU GO G4!), food and picture-taking! My cousins, aunts and uncles from up north had a flight leaving at 6 am the next morning, so my cousins, my sister and I decided not to sleep until they had to get ready at 3:40 am!   Monday, the 5th was Alan & Stephanie's birthday brunch at Tin-Tin restaurant. Mmmmmmmm...too bad I was too busy chit-chatting to go for a second round.  I had the best time ever, wishing our reunion could've lasted a whole month! But I bet the time would've gone by just as fast. Isn't that always the case when you're having fun? I'm looking forward to the next reunion of the Big, bad Bautista Clan. Vallejo 2006, here we come! In the meantime, I'll be here, missing everyone. Thanks family! To quote Ben, "I love being a Bautista!" Check out some photos!

       BUSY BUSY BUSY...   I'm so excited to tell you guys everything and to show you all pictures, but I've been so busy! I've been yearning to blog since I got to Charlotte last Friday! Let's just say I love being a Bautista as much as I love being a Gonda. You never realize how much you miss family who's far away until you see them again and then have to say good-bye. I HATE THAT! I'm just grateful for instant messaging, e-mail and snailmail! Great sources of communication across the miles...oh yeah, free minutes too! ha ha ha...  Ok, until next time...

Happy 4th everyone! Be safe!!!

       WORK IT OUT…LITERALLY   Going home and hiding under the covers, wanting to run over everything and everyone who got in my way, eating a whole carton of dulce de leche ice cream as I watch Wedding Planner for the 50th time; these are just some of the things I so desperately wanted to run out of the office and do yesterday. I was just in such a sour mood. I won’t get into why because I don’t want to get all exasperated about it all over again, but just know that I was seriously ready to hurt something, someone, anyone, ANYTHING cuz I was so irritated. But I didn’t. Instead I went to the gym last night and turbo kickboxed my way out of pent up infuriation and into some form of channeled sanity. After the workout (they’re on Round 21, by the way, Riann), I felt 10 times better than I had when I got there. I got my ass rocked (along with every other muscle and joint in my body), but it’s a good kind of pain because at least I know the workout, well, worked. Cile’s rediscovered running regimen lately reminded me of this healthy way to deal with life’s frustrations.  I’m so glad I looked to 24-hour Fitness for help this time rather than Krispy Kreme or the mall…or worse yet – Best Buy.

        Getting to know...      JOHN JOSEPH MELOCOTON CARLOS aka JOEMAMA    Vitals:  Met our junior year at UCI because, well, I met most of my UCI buddies junior year because I was one of the costumes coordinators for PCN. Along with 250+ cast members, I got to dress up Joemama in native Filipino gear (a gold vest and some hammer pants, ha ha ha) = 5 years and counting  Role In My Life : Perfect Example of "Go With the Flow" - I've only known Joe for 5 years and already I've grown to appreciate his maleable and easygoing demeanor. He's always game to go out and do things; have sushi even if he has to drive 50 miles to get it, go on weekend or week-long vacations, see a concert with friends which didn't start until past midnight...on a weekday, travel up to LA two days in a row to celebrate Valentine's Day with his fellow singles and then attend a birthday lunch, head to the beach to go bodyboarding, etc all the while hardly ever complaining because he enjoys his friends' company. Just read his blog and you'll see what I mean.  Good Times : Aside from great conversations via AIM (which range from mindless Hillary Duff banter to contemplative life talks), it’s always a fun time with Joe. This past Valentine’s day, he spent a whole evening with Leia, Fantone, Gwen, Iya and me and didn't complain once about being the only guy there. And then one time we all spent the weekend in San Diego and Joemama let me frenchbraid his then long ass hair! Ha ha ha...talk about slumber party activities! The week in Hawaii in 2003 was the most I got to hang out with this guy and I could write a 10-screen long entry about how much fun it was.  In his own words:  ”Hey Anna daw!”…”What’re you doing daw?”…”I’m gonna go to sleep daw”…”Sleep tite daw!” Eversince Joe learned this word, he puts it at the end of all of his sentences.

       MY MUSICAL SUMMER   I have not only been blessed with a busy summer filled with fun travels with friends and family, but I've also been fortunate enough to have experienced a handful of great concerts:   HARRY CONNICK, JR. - "You say tomayto, I say tomahto, You say potayto, I say potahto..."  If I could tell you my favorite place thusfar to watch a concert, I would say, hands down, the Hollywood Bowl. This place already holds a special place in our hearts because our high school graduation took place there! My fellow Immaculate Heart sisters and I take great pride in this unique event in our lives. But aside from that, watching a phenomenal performer like Harry Connick, Jr ANYWHERE would have been treat enough for everyone there, but to listen to him serenade us under the moon and stars was just...amazing. Everyone there had a picnic dinner before and/or during the concert, and that, I think, is what made the concert even more worthwhile for me. How many venues encourage you to bring your own food so as not to necessitate the purchase of a $7 hot dog? Harry performed with a good amount of alcohol in his system too, and that, aside from his singing, was entertainment by itself. He's really funny too! Great music, great performer, great venue...   BOYZ II MEN  - "Never, never let a broken heart, take your chance for love away..."  No one can sing the classic ballads like Boyz II Men do...at least not in my lifetime (although our boys *NSYNC surely come close. I'm amazed by any group who can harmonize a capella effectively, i.e. En Vogue). Anyhow, we went to the Boyz II Men concert at the House of Blues in Downtown Disney this past friday and wow...did we feel old! Minus bass Michael McCrary,  the guys of the talented vocal group thanked everyone for standing by them for 13 YEARS! And I know all of us counted backwards and said, "13 years? We were only 11-13 when they came out?" That's like our parents going out to see the Bee Gees or the Beach Boys in concert! Boyz II Men are from OUR adolescence!  That's crazy! From the first beat of  Motownphilly , to the heartwrenching  On Bended Knee  and  Water Runs Dry , and then the  End of the Road  encore, the audience sang our vocal chords out. Talk about nostalgia! I can't begin to tell you about all the flashbacks I had in those 2 hours! From junior high memories of youthful exuberance, to high school heartbreak, to college crushes and then to the present state of longing,  I reminisced like crazy. I love how music can make you do that. And if there's anyone who sing about the feelings curing stage of love and like, it's Boyz II Men.   JOSH GROBAN - "You raise me up so I can stand on mountains..."  A 23 year-old with the voice to compete against the Three Tenors, that's who this guy is. I'm gonna see him in concert in about 2 weeks and I'm so excited! I'm just so amazed with young people who have such great talents! What a gift to share with the world! I'll tell you all about it after.

       THE SUN’LL COME OUT TOMORROW   You all know what it’s like to deal with bad situations in life that don’t seem to have a beginning or an end, thereby making it almost impossible sometimes to handle because we don’t know where the stupid issue came from. At times they start out as small cracks on the ground that cause you to lose your balance for a second, but eventually turn out to be nothing more than life’s way of checking to see if we’re paying attention. But then sometimes, before you know it, those cracks turn into these huge potholes that pull you into a black abyss of melancholic aggravation. That’s when we turn to self-loathing, or in most cases, loathing everyone and everything around us. The choice that faces us when these seemingly unbearable moments in our lives take place is to either resist it and complain and pout all the while or allow ourselves to face it, deal with it and let it pass. Iya always reminds me of the wise words we learned from  My Best Friend’s Wedding  when things become difficult: “This, too, shall pass.”  I can’t tell you how many times I’ve cried myself to sleep when I’ve felt lost or alone and then woke up the next day feeling like everything would be different somehow.  I’ve learned that fighting the need to marinate in sorrow is difficult to do, but necessary to survive adversity. And it’s not only more helpful to the soul, but much better for the heart and ulcer too. There really is truth to Annie’s mantra. I don’t know what it is, but there’s just something about looking to that “next day” to alleviate pain, minor and major.  Tamyra Gray has a song on her cd that totally describes all this. It’s called:                                                   YESTERDAY / TODAY         It’s just been one of those days   When nothing seems to be going right   And no one’s there to lend a helping hand   Just an ordinary day    When it all seems like a fight    Just to make it to the promise land       Tell me how do you keep yourself from falling   In the midst of all your doubts and all your fears   Tell me how do you keep yourself from drowning   How do you find the strength to persevere         Cuz the sun is shining on my face   And I know that things will be ok   It’s gonna be better than yesterday today   And tomorrow will be better than today   I can see the dawning of a brand new way   It’s gonna be better than yesterday today   It’s gonna be ok   It’s gonna be ok…eventually       Teardrops slowly fall from my eyes as I look to the sky   And I question how come life keeps passing me right on by   I just wonder why I can’t escape, is this my fate   To always be unhappy and how much longer must I wait       One day I know that I   Will truly find peace of mind   Happiness is not far away   Just around the corner comes   A sight of hope to release me from   My chains and set me free   Free so I can breathe     **And speaking of looking to tomorrow, a few weeks ago my cousin, Ben, was feeling down because he couldn't seem to get going on his job hunt for a school that could use his counseling skills. I felt bad for him but knew that it would only be a matter of time before something came up. That boy's too smart and able for a school to pass him up. 'Lo and behold, he went on an interview last friday and he got hired this past Monday! You go, Ben! I'm so proud of you!

        Getting to know...      ENRICO ALVARADO TRIBIANA aka E-RIC    Vitals:  I met Eric a scattered number of times during our senior year in high school. But one night I called Cecile and she happened to be talking to him on the phone so she asked me to 3-way (3-way, how high school is that!). After a few minutes, she had to go so she had Eric call me. That phonecall lasted 2-3 hours, our first conversation = 8 years and counting  Role In My Life:  Mr. Go-Getter – I’ve chastised Eric a few times for being careless and dumb about various incidents (about girls, riding pocketbikes with no helmets, etc). Sometimes I wonder when he’s gonna smarten up and be more careful! But after 8 years I realized that he’s the way he is because he doesn’t want to ponder too long on making decisions. That might just cause uncertainty to surface and keep him from doing what he wants to. I remember Eric telling me once how he doesn’t want to live a life full of regrets. You will hardly see him wallowing in sadness or frustration. He doesn’t like wasting time on such things and I admire him a great deal for that.  Good Times:  Eric and I have had our share of “hard times,” you might say. And it’s taken me awhile to realize how happy moments between good friends far outweigh those hard times I just couldn’t forget. Eric and I were partners for Rochelle’s debut (dropped the dumb flower I had to hold during the performance but we recovered, didn’t we?), we worked at Universal Studios for a summer (“Chill, this is Eric!”…”Jurassic Outfitters, this is Anna!”), talked on the phone until all hours (talkin’ ‘bout hey the sun’s rising!) and just vacationed in Hawaii with our best friends! And this is just the tip of the iceberg!  In his own words:  “Hey it’s getting kinda boring. Where’s all the drama? No more drama?”
