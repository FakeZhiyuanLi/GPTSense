      This is just something I must comment on. I have had various debates with members of our church concerning this subject. I guess I might be considered a more liberal Baptist than some.&nbsp; Each side, liberals and conservatives has their own take on what the Bible says. Each can quote passages for and against. It can be rationalized either way depending on ones belief to begin with.&nbsp;    urlLink Http://www.religioustolerance.org &nbsp;has some great information both pro and con on Christian belief in homosexuality. &nbsp;As a Baptist I originally thought homosexuality should be condemned.&nbsp; What I now believe is that I am so far removed from it that I &nbsp;cannot understand it or relate to it. Upon my own choosing neither&nbsp;do I have to condone it. I have known some wonderful people who were homosexual. Did God not create them also? Who am I to say that&nbsp;their sexual preference&nbsp;is right or wrong? I will let The Almighty&nbsp;make that judgement when the time comes. &nbsp;

       We have just returned from a&nbsp;week in Door County /&nbsp; Sturgeon Bay Wisconsin.&nbsp;It's an 8 hour trip - about 400 miles from Zionsville. I&nbsp;would like to tell you a bit about our vacation.     &nbsp;   Sturgeon Bay, located between Lake Michigan to the east and&nbsp;Green Bay to the west, &nbsp;is a neat little town of about 10,000 in winter and probably 5 times that in summer.&nbsp; I always think I would like to move to a town that size. The people we met were pleasant to be around.&nbsp;&nbsp;Restaurants we ate at were good.&nbsp; If you ever get there remember to wander through the Door County Museum and take a 2 hour cruise on an old Chicago Fire boat with Door County Cruises. If you don't have a boat with you it's a great way to see Sturgeon Bay.     &nbsp;   Door County as a whole is a beautiful place. It has been catering to the needs of tourists for over a hundred years.&nbsp; There are half a dozen really small towns (500-1000) people that have small shops and large marinas. If&nbsp; you are looking for a place to charter a fishing boat this is the place to go. There is enough going on in the area that a week is about the right amount of time. Each day I also got in my afternoon nap... and what is a vacation with out one.

      As an American Baptist (not to be confused with being a Baptist in America) I believe in Church and State Separation. The concept is very important to me. Instead of attempting to give you the reasons why I am directing you to a website that describes this much better than I... http://www.au.org/site/PageServer?pagename=issues .

      I am having a hard time with the United States being in Iraq. Please don't get me wrong. I have the utmost respect for those in the armed forces who have given their service and in many cases their lives for their country. I do not believe there was a direct threat to the United States from  Saddam Hussein. I do not believe a long term democracy will ever develop in that country. We will spend billions and billions of dollars that could have been spent otherwise and to what end?

      I don't think there is a better country in the world to live in. It allows you and me to do things like write a blog or say just about anything we want to without ending up in prison or being beheaded. Of course this country has problems. It always has and it always will...slavery, inequality among the races, the sexes, the classes. But I would never want to live anywhere else.

      I have been a Democrat for many years. It is one of those things that in a Republican family one just doesn't speak about. Well, I have come out of the closet... as a Democrat (I am however quite heterosexual). I hope my family will understand. There could be things much worse. If Bill Clinton was able to run again I would vote for him a third time.  I voted for Gore and by now I think a lot of people wish he would have won. I will vote for Kerry and Edwards. Give the current ticket a chance. Can it be any worse than what we have seen in the last four years. I don't think so. Being a Democrat in Indiana and especially in Boone county is not particularly popular but I believe I can endure the hardship.

      like most can be taken or left. I have decided I wanted to say a few things. That's hard to believe. I evidently have become quite opinionated in my middle age.  No one really has to listen but if you would like please do and let me know your thoughts. This would of course include friends, relatives and all people in general.
