      Although I will believe it when I see it. HE was suppose to be home today at 4pm. That Didn't happen! But after making a few phone calls at 4am and standing at the company when the doors opened. He is coming home. If you are reading this you know me and how I hold it in until I explode well today I exploded. And I feel so much better. Although I did have a lot of help from Sgt Seamone. I don't think Brian has any idea the fire I lit but oh well it got him home. HAhA. And I get my baby back .

      When will I be done. I realize I was a mean kids but, as a human being I can only take so much. When will it be over, haha just joking. Yesterday Quintin kept hitting and kicking his uncle Scott in the private area. And memories came flooding back. I remember I use to kick boys there all the time. My poor neighbor Dustin was the target 95% of the time. I guess it was my strange way of flirting with him. I hope Quintin isn't flirting with Scott.I mean after all at least go out a few branches from the tree. Well anyways I have been spending my time racking my brain so I can get prepared for whatever comes next. If memory serves me correct Gabby should be getting ready to hit Quintin with an electrical cord. Let me go put the authorities on stand by.

      I guess everyone is entitled to a pitty party every now and again. SO mine was yesterday, and it was big. Brian called we fought and then he called back and we made up. We are both so stressed out it's not even funny. The only good thing is that he is getting tdy pay, so that's extra money.But I would trade the money any day for him. All my friends have their men back so they are slowly disappearing. All but bean addict Lorien, thank god for her. Her and Scott keep me sane. I don't think I told you guys she lives in another town so she has to drive a good ways to see me. But she does it almost everyday. Her man is home too so I have to share my time with her, butt I guess thats ok. Well Brian will be home Wednesday we hope. But I am not counting on it til I see him in person. So until then I guess I will be blogging and cleaning and playing a whole lot of text twist! I am addicted to that like lorien is to coffee beans.

      I have had so much fun lately, I haven't laughed so much in a long time. At one point this week I was even singing New Kids Step By Step. I should have got my dolls out but it was to late.And no matter what lorien and gwyn say they still ROCK! After getting lost 20 times going to the beach, almost dying in a thunder storm in the walmart parking lot, and getting high off of chocolate covered coffee beans, I can say I have had a good week. I can honestly say I finally took Brians advise and did stuff I wanted to do. It was so fun, A big thank you goes out to gwyn and the bean addict lorien. I have a feeling that will be our next intervention. Gotta go shave my legs Brian comes home in less than 24 hours!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      My mother and friend Lorien, seem to think I need an intervention. No I am not on drugs and I don't drink. They seem to think I cannot say the word NO! I am always going out of my way to make sure everyone else is comfortable, happy,and taken care of. If I have my own plans and some one needs something I cancel my plans to help them out. I have no idea why but it is my first instinct to say yes. I know it drives Brian crazy, but he does it to. I cant count how many times we have helped people move, let people stay with us until they found a place, or even gave people money. I am constantly babysitting for people even though I officially quit doing that a month ago. I just cannot find it in me to say no,is that so bad. Is it so bad that I feel the need to constantly help people out. I figure they wouldn't ask if it wasn't needed, so I should do it. So mom and Lorien although you think I am crazy, this is me. I cant change I have tried. And although we might not see the pay off now, one day we will. Even if it is at the pearly gates. I will try to get you in but cant promise anything.

      I have been so busy lately. I have been helping my friend move all week, bible school is going on, getting the house ready for Brian on Sunday, planning an event that I will post about later, and on top of all that trying to catch my breathe! Which I still haven't done. Brian told me last night that I am an angel for all that I do. But I am far from angel, an angel wouldn't complain. I am trying to cut back on the complaining. This way Brian isn't glad to deploy to get away from his nagging wife. Anyways, I still have a lot to do today and I am babysitting, so let me go. If I have time later I will post about my outrageous crazy life.

      Melfer is my sis, the cool one, (just joking Maggie). We have done so many stupid things it is amazing we are both alive with out any speech slurs, body twitching or even the slightest slobbering problem. She has really been through a lot over the last few month's admit I was really worried about where her life was going. But she has came out on top. And I am absolutely proud of her. She ignored what everyone was saying including me and followed her heart. Look where it got her, to happiness. It is so nice to call her and hear her laugh on the other end, or tell me something fun they did. She has truly found someone whom she can love that will love her and the kids the same.I really think that the book is finished we have all found our ending and we all live happily ever after.

      My freinds and i finlay made it back from walmart, (go to http://lorienslittleloveshack.blogspot.com/  for that story.) Anyways and we decided instead of making traditional welcome home banners we would be creative. So here is Brians:  Sgt Crawfords Honey Do List:  1. watch kids while I go to walmart. 2.The pile of dishes in the sink. 3.pick up dog do from your side of the bed. 4. Drive boyfriend home. 5.Find the kids. 6. Find your sheriffs badge. 7.Fix my car. 8.Rub My feet. 9. Take a shower. 10.ME.....ME............me......me.......me........me.....me....  And that will be posted on the fence at his work ! Hope he likes it. Something tells me I wont be getting my feet rubbed. But maybe he might arrest me.

        Megan must be in her bathtub waiting out another rain storm, as we haven't heard from her today. Since she isn't here is there anything you would like to know about her????? Did you know that when she first got her license she hit 2 mailboxes? One halloween she was grounded and had to wear a prison outfit complete with ball and chain to give out candy. She skipped school once and hid in her friends hot garage because she was afraid she would get caught..........well Megan is on the phone with me so I had better off..............bye bye

      It has been brought to my attention that some think that I cannot cook. I cant even explain how angry this makes me.Although we do not feel it is necessary to have a four course meal everyday, especially when Brian is gone. We do eat and I do cook obviously or my ass wouldn't be this wide. I have always cooked for my family and although it is not always deep fried or made form scratch, I do make a lot. So just because I have all purpose flour instead of self rising does not mean I do not know how to cook.

      People always pick this day to remember their dads, I don't. I remember him everyday. Although I don't remember that much a few years back I sent letters out to people that knew daddy. I only got one response out of around 12 letters, but it was worth it for that one. Aunt Linda sent me a letter with a funny stories about daddy. And mom always tells me a lot of things. I try to piece together everything I remember and things people tell me and tell my kids what a great and kind person he was. To hear them talk about him you would think they met him, but they love him just the same as their other grandparents. The very last memory I have of my dad is of me and him sitting in a car waiting on someone and I had to learn my spelling words so he was quizzing me and telling me funny ways to remember the words. Now that I am helping my kids learn words I think of that a lot.

      To understand this story you have to fist go to http://ducansoradams.blogspot.com. But have a hankie handy it made me cry. My niece is dressed up in this little patriotic outfit and every piece has a meaning. And her little wand was the light to show uncle brian the way home. Things like that stay with me forever, and make me proud to be his wife. And also makes me feel so loved, that my sis and her family would go through all that, it really meant alot. I guess there are still people out there that understand just what a strong set of letters USA are. I will always be grateful to be born here and for my children to live here as well. And I pray for others, that they could one day enjoy the freedoms we have. But I also know those freedoms come at a price, and I will never forget the people who pay it. I constantly ask Brian to get out of the army, he wont. Thank God for him and the other thousands like him, willing to lose there life so we can enjoy ours. I dont care what you view on war or politics are, you should be supportive of the troops. They are not the ones who say lets go invade so and so. They are just the ones that drop everything and go when they are told.They are the ones that sacrifice holidays and births and deathes and graduations, and so much more to make this world a better place.I have watched my husband go through so much and never complain because it could always be worse. This fourth of July I am going to celebrate life and freedom, and make sure the soldiers know we are grateful and pray for those who dont have freedom. I know it is still a little while away but I felt inspired by a beautiful red headed angel.

      I have decided what I want to do for my bday. I want to go skydiving with Brian. I called and they said that we would be hooked up to a pro and that we could camp there at night, and we get a vidoe and 24 still shots. Sound cool huh, now all I have to do is covince Brian. Although for some reason I think I am just saying that because I know he will go, I am the one who might chicken out. But I want to do something exciting, and over come a fear at the same time. So I have decided what better time than now. wish me luck, it wont be until July. So dont worry this isnt my last post, haha!

      Why do people always think about vacations and fireworks for the 4th? And honestly how many of you have a flag up at your house? I dont mind people celebrating with picnic and fireworks, but also remember the day and why we have it. I put out my decor this week, although my flag is always out. I have hung another flag in my front window with red white and blue stars around it. I will make a deal with you , to keep up with maggie spirit of giving. If you can send me a picture of a flag up at your house, I will donate a bag of food to the nearest shelter. And as a bonus if you can get your kids to send me a letter explaining what the 4th of July is really about, I will donate food and send them there on patriotic goodies to wear on the 4th, so hurry up.

      I recently had an adventure that I wont forget. It is one of those scary while you going through it funny when you talk about it deals. My neighbor and his wife were fighting, and the cops showed up around 11:30pm. Yes they even come to my nice quiet neighborhood. I guess he had been drinking since lunch so when they went up to talk to him, he took off running. They couldn't find him, and told me they thought he jumped my fence and was hiding in my back yard. Wonderful thing to tell a woman who is scared of anything and everything. Luckily my family was still here so I had backup! My dogs were barking so I believe he was too. Anyways they didn't find him she packed her kids up and drove off. The police gave up looking not that they actually did in the first place, and they left. So I am sure if you have ever met me you know I am freaked out at this point. Then it happened I heard a noise, usually I would call mom and tell her to stay on the phone with me while I checked it out. But Rita was here, and before you say no she didn't yes I did.I didn't even get out of bed before yelling to rita did you hear that. It was 1:30 in the morning but she was still brave enough to get up and investigate with me. So we slowly made our way to the kitchen after stoping briefly to pick up a hammer. It sounded like it was coming from the garage. But I knew what ever was in there was stuck in there and I didn't want to be the one to find it. So after boobie trapping the house with chairs and tables we went to bed. And around 2:30-3:00am I finally fell asleep. Well the next day we found out the noise in the garage was the dogs, quintin forgot to tell his uncle they go in the kennel so they just put them in the garage. I told him he has no idea what he put me through, that I was gonna kick his butt. And as if Scott wasn't laughing enough he found out my little secret of the night. He was playing the ps2 in my room and leaned back on the bad and found it. No dirty mind it's not what you think. I had slept with that big ass hammer all night. Just in case,I had that and the phone. Although it is highly likely I would just start crying or pass out and never use either one. So that was it mom that is my police story I said I had to tell you, so go ahead people and laugh, although I am quite sure you already have.

      Just a little bit of info, don't call someone collect if you care about them. My husband is in California and had to call collect a few times we never talked longer then 18 min. Thank God or I couldn't even post this, because my service would be cut off for lack of funds. I got the bill it was $125.53 just for the collect calls that isn't the regular service charges. I do have free long distance so I don't have to pay for the 100 times a day I call Mel and Mom.  I try to call Maggie but she never answers her phone so I quit. When they say love is blind it is true, I didn't see the dollar signs when we were talking to each other. At the time I remember him saying don't worry about it, just enjoy us getting to talk. Some soulmate huh, just joking Brian I love you. Good thing I had that yard sale,haha. So for future knowledge only call your enemies collect.

      Does anyone else have an issue with bathrooms? It started in kindergarten, I got locked in one for what seemed like hours. It was one of those ones inside the class, I remember the principal and the janitor finally getting me out. I was so scared I  wet myself, while I was standing next to the toilet. Then when I was a teenager, my cousin and I went to use the bathroom at a gas station. There was no door knob, saw we took turns. I went first and of course the door shut all the way and I was stuck. I turned into that 5 year old little girl. Thank God I didn't wet myself! Till this day I will drive home if at all possible to use the restroom. I am just waiting for the day when I am old enough to carry my toilet around with me in the trunk and it be normal. Stop laughing I am traumatized!!

      Recently I have been told to get a job, you must be bored, get a life. That is what some of my familiy members have said because I took the time to create a blog  site for our family to go to and post updates on themself, and their families. This is not my first attempt to get the family  in touch a little. I created a news letter and sent it out 3 times,and only got a small response from not even a hand full of people. Maybe I am just old fashioned but I believe that family is the root to happiness. All of my favorite child hood memories involve family,like when we use to get together and have yard sales at mammaws (pat always had the best toys and games), and when we got together for the 4th of July. Maybe it is just because Brian is in the Army and deploys alot, and the fact we know the risk he takes when he goes. We live each day to the fullest because you are not guaranteed the next. Brian an I have even been caught joining in with the kids and their friends playing.I guess you could say that our house is the neighborhood hang out, it is not unusual to have 10 kids here at any given time. We just have a close relationship with the kids and hope it continues to be this way as they grow older. Or it might be that I lost daddy at such an early age.I dont want a day to go by without letting the people I care about to know I love them and will be here if they need me for anything. It seems now that everyone is caught up in the hussle and bussle of work and all the stresses and life, and dont take time to appreciate the family they have. It is sad that we always get together at funerals and that is it. I want my kids to know thier family, they are also very big on family. Not a day goes by they arent talking about their uncle's aunts and cousins. And they love their grandparents and dont feel like it is a burden to talk to them. Sometime our familiy has been known to only call when you need something. Well guess what PEOPLE I need something, you to just be ther when I want to say hello, or tell you the funny thing that happened today.I do have to say that my mother is not to be placed in this catagory, she is amazing. Not only is she my mom when I need her to be, but she is my best friend other than Brian. I can tell her anything and know I wont be judged, and she doesnt complain when I call all the time.I would give anything to go back and make more memories with daddy,and memories are what keeps the kids and I going when Brian is gone. We didnt choose to be family, God chose us to be. Dont you think there was a reason for that, and I bet it wasnt so that we never talk.

       urlLink    Quintin is so proud. When his coach gave it to him he said that Quintin was the only kid on the team that was a perfectionist, that he was determined to do his best. And if he went to bat and didnt knock it out of the field he would visibley get upset at himself.He said that he would not be suprised to see Quintin playing Pro sometime. So now Quintin is asking when he is pro, can he buy his own baseball card.&nbsp; urlLink

      Starting when I was little I would dream of being in love and getting married. And as I got older I started getting scared that I would never find that love.I thought I would end up like these women that lived above us in cowee in a little green house.I never met them but I knew they were lonely and everyone said they were mean. All I was finding was the same old losers that seem to be everywhere. Melody was married and Maggie was married and I was in high school and the longest relationship I had was maybe 2 months. I will never forget when I met Brian, My friend Jennifer Holland took me to the bowling alley (where else could you go in Franklin at the time). Anyways she introduced me to Brian and he was bowling, I dont remember the lane # but I remember it was the third lane down from the far right wall. I remember my first glance at him he was looking down the lane, so i just saw a side view of him and he was laughing and smiling. He was wearing jeans and a sweater with little deer across the chest part.Till this day I wont let him throw it out because it reminds me of that day, and a flannel Ron Jons hat. I remember being so nervous when I was talking to him, and you may not believe me but I remember feeling tingles in side. I swear I am not joking so stop laughing. Our first date he came to my house ( maggie's cause I lived there at the time), we lay on this minature futon for kids that had dinosaurs on it and cuddled up and watched movies.It was short lived though cause maggie came out and said he had to go it was getting late. So the first time Brian met maggie she had extremely bad bed head. We dated off and on because he lived in Greenville and I joined the national guard. I remember when we got married I was crying and I looked up at Brian and he was crying and I knew that I was marrrying the man God intended for me.And I am reminded of that constantly through out the day and in my life. Like when the phone rings I get excited and run to because I think it is him, and we are the only adults I know that still write love letters like they were in grade school. And it is really strange but we think alike when he was in Iraq we would write each other letters and date them and quite often we would be writing about the same stuff on the same day. Or we will be driving down the road and I will be thinking something funky and crazy and he will say it. It is scary though cause when I get mad I sit there and think does he know what I am calling him in my head? Just joking, there are so many things about our marriage that let me know I was put on this earth to meet him I could never share them all. And although we know we are soul mates we still have to work at it.. everyone does. Over the past few years we have figured out what makes our marriage work. 1. laugh.. you have to have fun 2. we keep no secrets no matter how bad it is we tell each other everything (even when I spend too much at walmart) 3. we always tell each other how we are feeling even if it means telling the other one they are being an ass 4. we always do stuff as a family we play with the kids instead of watching them play and last but not leaste 5. when ever we fight we always get over it and let it go life is to short to hold grudges. Now the only thing I sit around and worry about is that the kids we will find their soulmates, and for gabby's sake I hope he does dishes.

      The last few days I have found myself in complete denial. I have been watching Quintin and Gabby throw fit after fit, and thinking to myself I know I did not act like that. The truth is I did!But Shhh dont tell anyone. Gabby got mad and started stomping her feet and Blowing air out of her nose. Just picture a bull getting ready to charge.It was so funny until it hit me I use to do that, but I would scream really loud while charging. I am truely fortunate that mom didnt end up drowning me in a bath tub somewhere. When her and Quintin fight it makes me feel like they really hate each other. Until I recall fighting with my sisters, Mel more than  Maggie. It is amazing that none of us ended up dead the way we fought. Although Melody's mean ass did break my nose. We were so mean to each other it is amazing that we still talk, and have the good relationship we do have.So as I sit here watching all the ways my kids get on my nerves I realize it is my fault, I did this to them. Quintin is so scared of everything it drives me nuts! But anyone who knows me knows I am the biggest chicken there is. Especially if you knew me around y2k or during a tornado warning (mom). And till this day I sleep with a light on although I make the kids think its on for them. So I guess I should just sit back and laugh cause I am paying for my raising. Sorry mom and anyone else who new my mean ass as a child

      I have been driving momma crazy calling her every single time absolutely anything happens to me. This month has been so hard, Brian left, the car broke down, his atm card doesnt work, property taxes, amd now our renter has to be evicted. I find myself drowning in my own private pitty party, and invited others to join me. Then I realized just how great my life is. I should thank God that I was born in a country that I could Own a car or a home, or that I was able to marry someone whom I loved and who wasnt picked for me to marry. I have been guilty of focusing on the negatives and not thanking God for my many blessings in life. I remember last year when Brian was gone I prayed to God to bring him back, that I didnt care if was in a wheel chair, or crazy that I would never stop loving him just please God bring him home. After he had been home for  awhile we fell into our routine getting on each others nerves and fighting about the bills, and stressing over little things. I guess I forgot about my prayer. I  need to wake up because three women in our unit didnt get their husbands back. Their kids didnt get their daddy home, and all though mine is currently away he is alive he will come home and our life will not come crashing down if my car doesnt get fixed. From now on when I call momma or any of you whining about my life remind me of Mrs Smith, and her children. Her husband died saving my husband and many others in his unit, and she isnt whining. I spend a big part of my day worrying and complaining instead of looking at life for the amazing thing it really is. I hope that through reading this you to will realize although the cards seem stacked against you, your hand is always better than someone elses.

      Ok, mom bought a cabin with 12 acres of land. It is absolutely beautiful! Brian decided not to reenlist, we will be moving with her to Minnesota. Here is the kicker no electricity,or plumbing. We will be roughing it. I am so excited , Brian and I are gonna build our own cabin next to theirs. Thank God I married a man who can do almost anything. He built log cabins when we were first married and worked in construction for many years. So it shouldn't be too hard. So I am going to spend the next few months selling our stuff, and moving to mom's. While he is in Iraq I will be buying supplies and tools, so when he comes back we can get started. I am so excited this is something Brian and I have wanted to do for many years. Thanks to mom our dreams can come true. I know mom and I will have our spats, like normal but she truly is my best friend and I am so grateful the kids and I will be so close to her. No we aren't crazy, we just want our kids to grow up appreciating life. I hope you all will visit, and thank God this happened before Brian signed his contract to stay here. It will be so nice to have him back for good. Ok I will shut up I am so excited, so who ever has my name for Christmas get me a battery operated hair dryer. LOL

      The kids are both on a week of restriction, no friends, no tv, no computer, no games. So this morning when they woke up we gave them paper and a pencil and had them write there full name over and over again, to help improve their hand writing. Well Gabby wrote gabby instead of gabriel. We wanted her to write her real name because she doesnt even know how to spell it , she never goes by it. So I ask her to go back and write Gabriel. Well after a few minutes of crying and screaming, she brought me her paper and threw it at me and said real snotty "I'm done." You want believe what was on the paper! She had drew a picture of&nbsp; a really mean face , and that was it. I tried to hold back my giggles until she left the room. So it is officially now the last smart ass has bloomed, our family is complete!

And I have to attempt to find the rest of my house from the hurricane they inflicted on the house last night. I am still awaiting word on Brians pass, hopefully its good news. HAPPY ANNIVERSARY to MOM and Will. Love ya!

      This weekend seemed to fly by! We just lounged around, cleaned out the toy boxes and watched trading spaces. Next thing you know the weekend is over. The kids and I did go to church, we finally found one down here that we like and it is with in walking distance of the house. Imagine that! We are planning a trip to mom's this weekend but have to wait for Brians mileage pass to be approved. I cannot believe this is the last week of summer, where did it all go? We have started planning the kids birthday party, we haven't decided whether we would combine them and have a carnival or do them separate so gabby can have a real tea party. I would appreciate any feed back on ideas. We always try to do something special on there birthdays, actually thanks to my moms genes we try to make every holiday big down here! Daddy's B-day party turned out so nice. The kids and I spent the morning making cards, writing letters and making banners. Then we layed the banners out, and placed our bundle of cards and letters in the center, then we lit them on fire. Before you ask why, we came up with this idea because smoke travels up and the kids and I figured it was the quickest way for it to get to heaven since the mail is so unpredictable now days. As it was burning we sang happy Birthday, and then out of nowhere the wind started blowing. The kids and I decided it was grandpa Woody blowing them a kiss. I couldn't think of a better way to honor daddy on his birthday. I think it will start to be our new tradition for his birthday. Until next time!

      Today is my daddy's bday! He would be 52 years old. God how I wish he was here, there is so much I wish I could share with him. Although I should say I have shared everything with him. I often find myself having conversations with him. I like talking to him because he never tells me I talk to much,which if you know me you know I do. I just wish I could see his face when ever something good happens in my life. He had a beautiful smile, and I miss seeing it. I found myself crying the other day in the car&nbsp; when the kids started asking me&nbsp;questions about him. I just miss him so much, and I&nbsp;am so jealous of my sisters for getting so much time with him. But there are little things in life that make me think of him, like my big bushy eye brows (thanks dad)&nbsp;!!!!!!!!!! I know its sounds crazy but I know he is with me sometimes, I feel him. One time it was so strong I woke Brian up crying. Before you say anything I am not crazy, I just know that my dad is watching over his little girl. I feel like since I was so young and don't remember a whole lot about him, I owe it to my kids to tell them every&nbsp; little detail. We often talk about him in car rides and they ask all kinds of questions, and like me their favorite part&nbsp;is when grandma and grandpa were together. I have noticed that threw the years people don't really like to talk about daddy, they just kind of put him in the past. I wish for his birthday people would take time to celebrate his life, and say good things about him and share funny stories. Please take time today to tell my daddy happy bday!

       I have come to realize that there is no hope we are stuck here! But its ok because they are offering us a big chunk of change to stay. So I guess we will live. We will be here for the kids entire elementry school years. After learning this I have decided to go back to school in the fall for my lpn. (wish me luck). So by the time Brian gets back I will have my career on track and it should be smooth riding. OK I know it want be but its ok we are always prepared. Just wanted to let you know we are stuck here for a while.

      I am so excited, I found out yesterday that there is hope. We might be able to reenlist and move!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I hope we can we have been here since 2000, and I am ready to go. We aren't quite sure where we can go, but we should find out our options today. If I go to Germany liked we had planned before please everybody keep their internet on,&nbsp; Brian wont let me call that much. He said it will be a drastic cut back, from calling mom 5-10 times a day to once every week. I cant do that that is just unrealistic. But we will wait and see. Quintin takes the last part to his test today. He told me yesterday it was easy just a bunch of shapes and filling in bubbles nothing fun! Gabby is doing fine she keeps asking everyday if it is time to go back to school, and when told not yet, she proceeds to crying. She is the big Social bee of her class, she knows everyone and everywhere we go someone comes up and hugs her. She did get one note home last year saying she was getting in other peoples business. Brian said its not her fault, she gets it from her momma that's all she knows! I hate to say, its true! Well let me go get rid of my bed head, and by the way go watch Cold Creek Mountain its good, a must see!

I kinda hope he doesnt get in gifted class, I dont want my baby growing up to fast. But I think he will do good on the test. I will keep you posted on the out come. If he goes into the program one day a week he will go to a different school for classes. But we wil see. bye bye got to go play go fish with Gabby.

      &nbsp;I am back! We had a great weekend, had family come down, had some friends over for a cookout, and topped it off by going to a water park! But I have to say I am really glad things are getting back to normal. I have to start getting the kids back in there routine for school. I f I start now they might actually wake up on the first day ( I hope). Quintin goes Wed. And Thurs. for testing.&nbsp; He has been recommended for the gifted program. So we will see what happens. Although he doesn't know what its for, or else he would be rubbing it in Gabby's face.&nbsp; Gabby has become my little helper lately. She is always wanting to help cook and set the table, and my fav, do the dishes. Too bad I still cant get her to clean her room. And Brian is doing fine , getting ready to go back to work in the morning. We enjoyed his time off but I sware it went by so fast. And I am just relaxing and cleaning house. Oh yeah I forgot to tell ya we got our videos from skydiving. The guy did a great job, and besides a few scary butt shots I loved them. Anyways I am&nbsp; gonna go enjoy my normal day, bye bye!  &nbsp;

      What a rough life I have, yet another day at the beach. A friend of mine called last night and invited me to the beach. Brian is taking gabby,and scott fishing, and I am taking quintin. This way quintin can play with Tanner. Tanner is a little boy that quintin met in school and they use to hang out in time out! It is nice to give quintin and gabby a break every once and awhile. So we are going back to the beach for a 3rd time in a week, man its rough being me. Just joking, other than the sun burn its great. So what ever you are doing today I hope its fun. Live life to its fullest and have fun!

       This is out of the Franklin Press. I went to school with Danya and Derrick they are both really great people.    I need all friends and readers of the Press ot help me once again keep my brother's cold-blooded killer in prison. Scott K. Quillen went in Derold Garry Ledford's home about 3 a.m., October 18, 1991, crawled up beside his bed, awakened him, and killed him. As Quillen testified, he had broken into the home through a basement window and staked out everything the day before. (Because of evidence). Then Quillen took a 357 Magnum and in cold malice murdered Darold. To me, this was premeditated, but allowed a plea bargain, got "life" for first-degree burglary and second-degree murder. Suspected motive was robbery!  Derold's three children, Danya, Derrick, Deidre, my brother Don, and I will go before the Post-Release Commission July 13, 2004. We only have 30 minutes to tell them why Quillen should be kept in prison, what he took away from us. As many that want to can go, but the appointment is for 5 by law. Please help us by writing before July 13 to the N.C. Post-Release Commision, 2020 Younkers Rd., 4222 MSC, Raleigh, NC 27699-4222 Re: Scot K. Quillen, ID 0333790, Fax: 919-716-3987. Please ask for no freedom.  Deanne Ledford Raby -Franklin

      Ok Mel , moms right. We should get together and write a chapter per kid. It would be hilarious, between hope tightening her seat belt, and Gabby telling her teacher day before yesterday she just got back from surgery , It would be a best seller. I think God puts those funny little incidents in there so we can put up with our children. I too am struggling with the home work issue. According to Quintin I should be calling Hospice, because if his teacher doesn't cut back on spelling words, he isn't gonna make it much longer. The only good thing about homework is that since they are both in the same grade they have the same spelling words so we study as a family. I am finally teaching Brian to spell!!!!! (Just joking ). Quintin informed our preacher Sunday that when we move we would leave 3 days before church that way we could drive down and still go to this church. He said he likes it to much and we aren't allowed to miss a Sunday. I guess we should go ahead and get those new tires, for all that traveling. Well I have to go My friend is having a baby today and I have to go back up there and check on her. By the way I could use your prayers tonight, SPELLING TEST"S in the morning.

      Today is my cousin Nikki's birthday. Nikki is the cousin who I am the closest to and I think of her as a friend. We have done so many things together and went through so much, I cannot think of a memory from cowee without her in it. We have had a few spats like sisters do, but we always come out of it friends. She is so kind hearted and soft spoken, She deserves the best that life has to offer. She has never complained about taking care of her brother Chris, and I sware she would give a frog mouth to mouth if it needed it. I had the pleasure of working along side of her at a nursing home as CNA's, I was so amazed at the way she talked to the people, and watched as she listened. She has touched so many lives and probably will never even know. I have been blessed with 19 cousins, having Nikki as one of them is a great Bonus. Thanks for always being there, I love you ! Happy Bday.

      I started babysitting again today, I have a 2 year old and 3 year old. We have already had lots of fun creating art, and are fixing to take a walk. I just thought I would take time to say Hi, and let everyone know I didn't mean to be so bitter in my blog yesterday. I was just a little frustrated with some comments made recently. Anyways, the fun of school has officially started! Yesterday Gabby did her homework in about 15 min, Quintin took 2 hours. He swore up and down that writing his spelling words five times each would simply kill him! He only had 10 words, but he was dying. He finally finished when he saw us begin to eat supper, and he was still sitting there whining. I cant wait today is sentence day I am sure it will be fun!!!!!!! After eating Brian and the kids and I all went outside and played football. The neighborhood kids came over and we ended up playing for 1 1/2 hours. It turned out to be a blast besides quintin pegging me in the face (which I still say was on purpose). And as if that wasn't enough Brian watched the kids and I went to do kick boxing with my neighbor. There is no other explanation than a miracle that I was able to get out of bed this morning. I had so much fun though I am gonna go again tonight, that is if quintin finishes his homework in time.

      Over the weekend I was called a Bum, along with Brian and my mother. We were told that we were moving up to Minnesota and becoming bums. OK for some reason some people don't realize that for me and Brian our family is the number one thing and our life and that will never change. We are moving up there so we can actually be together and not have to go 6 mo to a year without seeing each other. Brian wants to be in the kids life all the time. Not to mention the risk of him losing his life the longer he stays in. And I am sorry but Brian is fixing to go fight for this country a second time, so anyone that ever calls him a bum can kiss my ass , and mark me off their Christmas list. We have a bond with our kids that many families will never know, and no matter where we live or what things we own that will never change. And for those of you out there that don't understand why mom and I are so close, its your own fault. Mom is the one person in life besides Brian that I know I can call anytime day or night with any problem and she will help me find a solution, or if she cant she will just make me find something funny in the situation. We have not always seen eye to eye, but over the last year our relationship has grown from mother and daughter to friend to friend. I only wish I would have let my grudges go along time ago so we could have had even more fun. So everyone needs to put their priorities in order before they start analyzing mine. If you died today would you say I wish I had five more minutes at the office? If I died today I would die knowing that I was a good wife and mother and knowing my family knows I love them and will never forget me.

      Sorry With school starting its seems like I should have more time but I don't. Anyways the kids are loving school and I am loving the break!!!!!!! I did talk to their teachers and I will be volunteering once a week, wish me luck. We haven't done much this weekend, just hanging out, We had Kerstin and Jake over for a cook out (no baby yet!),made a funny family movie (will explain later), and watched movies. Quintin and Gabby are getting along great lately but I think they teamed up and made a pack to just do what they want and agitate us as much as possible. But at least they are getting along! Well we got to get ready for church , I will post more when we get back. Don't worry I will pray for all your lazy butts they are still in bed!!!!!!!!!

      Thank god! We go today to meet their teachers and then in the morning they go to school. I have to say I am kind of excited! I get my alone time again. And I need it so I can read up on cabins and all kinds of stuff. I want to learn as much as I can so when I get up there I am not lost. We have already picked out a cabin kit we are going to buy , and have started the process of buying tools. So hopefully by the time Brian is back all we have to do is move up there and have the kit delivered. Although things usually don't run that smooth, so we are expecting some bumps in the road. We just hope they aren't too big. By the way welcome back Amy, we missed your blogging. And Melody are you still alive?????? Just wondering?
