      I just got a new baseball glove.  I'm pretty stoked since I haven't touched a baseball since high school.  The glove felt really good.  It's nostalgia reminds me of playing little league in Plano, TX and throwing around during high school.  I really liked baseball, but I ended up choosing golf.  When you get a new glove, you have to really put in a lot of effort, care and love.  The first thing I did was put it on and wear it around my apartment.  I live across the street from a ball park, so it was kind of cool to put the glove on and look out over my balcony.  Man, would I do anything to be a pro player.  I then proceeded to walk around my apartment, pounding into the stiff leather and pretending to pick of runners at first.  I even threw a couple of air pitches.  Bottom of the ninth, 5-4 lead, Terry Lim comes up and needs one more out to win the World Series.  He gets the signal, winds up and unleashes a 100 MPH high fastball.  "STRIKE 3, YOU'RE OUT!"  The next "breaking in" session involved an actual baseball and an actual person.  My buddy came over after he purchased a brand new glove, 2 baseballs (one little league, one professional, both the same size and for recreational use only).  We went across the street and just threw the ball around.  What a rush!  I felt like a kid again.  I couldn't believe I went all these years without playing baseball.  Never again.  I was even looking forward to having my kid and playing catch before dinner.  All from a big piece of cow butt.

      ...weekends were actually weekdays and weekdays were actually weekends.  We would now only work two days a week, and sleep in and party for 5 days.  It's possible.  There will have to be some modifications to our work/school ways.  1. No more lunch, coffee breaks and talks at the cooler. * we would now have to plow through work at full speed with no holding back.  No more dilly dallying and no more socializing at work.  This way we will work a full 8 - 10 hours for 2 days, which equals 16 - 20 hours a week.  Before we would work 40 hours a week.  However, if you take away the "fluff": a. Take away lunches at around 45 minutes each (that's 3.75 hours saved) b. Take away "breaks and chatting" at about 3 15 minute sessions a day (that's another 3.75 hours) c. Take away the bitching and complaining people do on Mondays ("aww, does someone have the case of the mondays?" "Yeah, so what? Fuck off!") and the exciting chatter on Fridays about the upcoming weekend ("What are you going to do this weekend?"  "The usual, get drunk, sleep in, and get rejected by not-so-cute girls at bars and clubs." "Really? Me, too?" "Cool, I'll call you, we can do it together." "OK") (this is another hour a week) ...you have just knocked off 8.5 hours.  2. People will be more appreciative for having better work environments because people are now happier.  I mean, come on, 5 day weekend, I would be flying at work, getting all my shit done and being Mr. Perfect Employee.  "Yes, sir. Yes, sir."  The quality of work will increase at least 2 fold, therefore making up for the 10 hour diffence, after subracting a, b and c from Change #1.  3. Since you are working less, their is less SG&A.  Expenses will shrink dramatically, people will take less vacations, less medical claims due to stress and overworking and much fewer employees will be stealing shit from work.  That'll save companies millions of dollars.  With these 3 changes put into effect, we can make the 5 Day Weekend work.  Fuck Alan Greenspan.  Nominate me for the next Fed Chairman.  T

      I've decided that I won't tell anyone I know about my blog.  I kind of like keeping it to myself.  Must be an only child thing.  Plus, I don't want to tell people about it and stress whether or not they like it or not.  What if my life is boring and now everyone knows?  I always thought it was OK.  Oh well, just keep this on the DL.  Our little secret.  Shhhhhh.

      Hello.  My name is Terry C. Lim.  You can call me Terry, Ter, T, Ter Bear (only if your special), T-Dogg, T-Bone, Master, Servant, Bitch, Sir, Hey You or Terrance.  If you call me the latter, I will give you a funny look.  I was born on November 16th, 1978 in Houston, TX.  Yes, there are other things besides Steers and Queers that come from Texas.  I was born around 11AM, I think.  I'm not sure because that day was a little hazy in my memory banks.  I heard that the time of the day your were born is your peak time of day.  My peak time is 11AM.  That makes sense because that's when I'm starving and have a voracious appetite.  But, we digress.  I'm an only child.  I used to think that my parents only had one kid because I was perfection.  I mean, Jesus was an only child.  Only later on in life did I realize that my parents only had one was because I was such a terror.  They couldn't handle another kid.  I'm pretty sure my mom really wanted/wants a daughter.  Oh well.  It's not like I was asked to be born.  I wasn't spoiled, but I usually got what I wanted.  Lot's of temper tantrums for this little nightmare.  I'm also a Scorpio.  They say that scorpios are really good in bed and very secretive.  One of those traits is very true.  Which one?  Well, you'll have to find out.  If you're a guy, I'll just tell you.  I grew up in Houston, TX, moved to Plano, TX (near Dallas) then came back to Houston.  Actually, it was Sugar Land, TX.  Sugar Land is a small suburb outside of Houston.  Southwest.  The only endearing qualities of Sugar Land are 1) Tara Lipinski is from Sugar Land, and 2) Lots of famous celebs and sports figures live there, i.e. Enron execs, Hakeem Olajuwon, Jeff Bagwell, and me.  Just because lots of rich people live there that doesn't mean my parents are rich.  We moved there when it was just a small development.  There wasn't even a McDonald's there.  Now, there are 3 McDonald's, 1 Burger King, 1 Taco Bell, 1 Sonic, 1 Popeye's, 1 KFC, 1 Outback Steakhouse, 1 Pappasito's, 3 Jack in the Boxes, 1 Smoothie King, 7 huge grocery stores, 1 huge asian grocery store (really), Circuit City, Home Depot, 3 movie theatres, 5 car dealerships, a big shopping mall, and many, many more.  It's huge now.  The traffic sucks balls, though.  Oh wait, I forgot, there's 1 Chik-Fil-A.  That's the best.  As you can tell, I love food.  I really love fast food.  I grew up on that stuff.  Anyway, Sugar Land is cool.  My high school sucked, but the food and my friends were cool.  Plus, the golf out there was awesome.  I love golf.  Since I can't marry golf, I want to marry someone who loves golf either as much as I love golf or as much as she loves me.  Very important for me.  I wouldn't mind raising kids there.  It's cheap.  You can buy a mansion on the golf course with 3 nice cars for $500,000.  Crazy, huh?  After high school, I went to school in California.  Why California?  Girls, weather and beaches.  I made a tiny error and picked Claremont.  Not exactly what I had in mind (I was duped) but I made the best of it.  I loved college.  The friends I made, the classes I took and the actual campuses were world class.  I would definitely be down for "Old School II."  I never went back to Texas that much the 4 years I was in school.  I probably went home 4 times.  After college, I accepted a job in San Francisco.  I did investment banking (monkey work).  I missed the dot.com boom by 2 years.  I could have been a gabizzillionaire.  Oh well.  Then I worked at Levi's.  I put buttons on the jeans.  Now, I'm at CNA.  It's fun and people are super cool.  I just wished it paid $1,000,000 a year.  I love SF.  I've been here for over 4 years.  It's the best.  I love my job, my home and my friends.  I just need to win the lottery, get a girlfriend and maybe a dog.  That's not too much to ask, is it?  I mean, if I win the lottery, I'll share with you.  Promise.  Best things about SF: 1. Weather 2. Terrain 3. Surrounding amenities, i.e. napa, berkeley, tahoe 4. People 5. Food 6. Fun stuff  Worst things about SF: 1. Fucking Expensive 2. Shitty basketball team 3. Korean food sucks ASS.  Pretty good, huh?  The best things definitely outweigh the worst.  So, now that you know a little more about me and are still here, let's see what else there is know about Terry.  I'm weird, so be warned.  But, I'm also interesting.  Never a dull moment with me, that I promise.  Take Care,  T

      I was spending another fun evening with my new female friend when I had a revelation.  I don't have any good stories.  Just in case, if there is an uncomfortable silence and a need for some fun, I would like to be able to tap into a file cabinet of stories and find one perfect for the occasion.  I cannot do that.  I can only complain and try to fathom a quick and dirty story to appease the crowd.  So, going forward, I will try to remember all my stories, mostly boring and Rated G, and write them down in the blog.  Now, I will have an archive and be able to become a storyteller.  Like that guy in "Big Fish."  I haven't seen "Big Fish" so don't know if that is right.  See, I could have had a story about the time I went to see "Big Fish" with a bunch and friends and how after the movie we went to **** and saw **** and did ****.  Stay tuned.
