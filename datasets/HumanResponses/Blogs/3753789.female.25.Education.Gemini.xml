      Ok, so I have a not so secret addiction.  FOOD. FOOD. FOOD. FOOD. FOOD. FOOD. FOOD. FOOD.  FOOD. FOOD. FOOD. FOOD. FOOD. FOOD. FOOD. FOOD. FOOD. FOOD. FOOD. FOOD . . . . . . ok, must stop.  I refuse to dedicate this entry to my low self esteem, so I will instead dwell on its cause.    I love food.  I love chicken sandwiches, and pasta, and french fries, and Subway sandwiches, and fish & hush puppies, and pizza.  But most of all I. LOVE. CHOCOLATE.  What is there not to love about chocolate?  Chocolate = Love.   So I will describe how to make one of my favorite Chocolate yummies so you too, Constant Reader, (okay, so I stole that from Stephen King - I love him) can enjoy its chocolaty deliciousness and fattening goodness.  My friend Meghan (whom I get to see about once every 2 years and who recently became engaged to sweet, cute boyfriend Daniel) used to spend the night together all the time.  It was there, in little bitty Scott, Mississippi, that I discovered the DOTTIE SHAKE.  Dottie is Meghan's mother.  She is the cutest thing, and every time I spent the night she would come up the stairs and say "Shall we have a milkshake?"  (She always said "shall" - it was great.)   I loved those milkshakes.  After about 20 minutes or so she would come back up to collect our glasses and ask "Do you want another one?"   Now, being the good overnight guest like my mother taught me to be, I knew the proper response was "No, Ma'am" (We say Ma'am religiously in the South).  However, I could NOT, COULD NOT!!!! resist the allure of the milkshake. "Yes, please; thanks, Mom."  (we - Meghan's friends - also called her mom, Mom, and her dad, Pop.)  I don't remember when, but eventually we christened the milkshakes "Dottie Shakes".  When my daughter was born, Mom (Dottie) and Meghan came to the hospital and brought... stuff to make Dottie Shakes!!!  We had to sit the ice cream right on top of the air conditioner to slow the melting, but OOOOOHHHHH Heaven, nothing could have made me feel better right then!  What mysterious magical goodness must be in these mythical Dottie Shakes, you ask?    Well, I will happily tell you.   BUT YOU MUST NOT DEVIATE FROM OR SUBSTITUTE FOR THE INSTRUCTIONS OR YOU WILL NOT BE EATING A MAGICALLY SCRUMPTIOUS DELICIOUS DOTTIE SHAKE.  Ok.  You  must  have:         Breyer's Vanilla Fudge Twirl Ice Cream     - -This is singularly THE most important part of the DS.  You must not even consider substituting ANY. OTHER. BRAND. of ice cream.  You will be sorely disappointed.  If and ONLY IF there is no Vanilla Fudge Twirl, then plain Chocolate will substitute.  NO OTHER OPTIONS.  Believe me, I have tried Breyer's Rocky Road, and other flavors, but it is disastrous and totally NOT a Dottie Shake.     Milk    - -Whole milk, not 2% or any of the other crappy milk.  If you are going to to the Dottie, you must go all the way.    Short, fat, plastic cup  Spoon  Napkin    Now you must get this part right.  Put whatever amount of ice cream you desire. (Be warned, if you make your DS too small, you WILL want another.  Go for it.)  The key is the MILK. Pour only enough milk over the ice cream to gently---GENTLY!!! cover it lightly.  1.5 seconds of milk pouring is precisely right.    Now take your spoon and moooosh the milk and ice cream together about 10 times.  You do not want the traditional milkshake consistency. If you can drink it through a straw, you have a) used to much milk and b) mooooshed too much.  Now wrap a napkin around your short, fat, plastic cup, because it is cold, and that's what Dottie (a.k.a. Mom) always did, so do it.  You're committed to this thing, right?  OK!  Eat.  Enjoy the frozen chunkiness.    Now, have another.   And there you go, a Dottie Shake.  I have been eating them for over 10 years.

      If you know me, you know that Bub and I have made some pretty serious cash from selling stuff on eBay. We started with Scottie Pippen yearbooks (since we attended and I teach at the same high school as our dear Bull) that went for way more than I expected.  $300, $200, $250.  I mean, dang. Who knew?  Then Bub started selling all his old baseball cards and stuff.  Lots more cash.  Then we sold everything else that was no longer of value to us.  Deer mounts.  DEER MOUNTS.  I mean really.  Those were a pain in the culo to pack, let me tell you!  Man, those were great times. The money was rolling in.    Then we ran out of stuff to sell.  I have made some money here and there off of clothes (Mine and Janie's), but I get SOOOO tired of listing and fees and all that hooplah.  I just listed some nice clothes of Jane Claire's, so hopefully they will sell.   However, I do believe it is just easier to take most stuff to the Helping Hands.  Big stuff: sell.  Little stuff: fuggetaboudit  Oh, if you want to PURCHASE or BID on any of those items, or screen name is RONDAWG80 - Just search by seller.  (Rondawg is my dad.... he started on eBay, got me hooked, and then quit fooling with it. I never changed screen names because we have 183 feedbacks!!! Yay! Told you we were good.)

      http:// urlLink www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=38776   (Maybe that link will work - if not, just copy and paste the dang think, ok?)  I am sick of Michael Moore.  I don't care about you or your silly movie, Mr. Moore.  So you think the Bush Administration fiddlefarted around, do you?  How did YOU get your title for this little documentary, Mr. Moore?  Did you ask nicely to borrow said title from one Mr. Bradbury?  All he needed was a phone call, a phone call he politely asked for.  What did you do, Mr. Moore?  You fiddlefarted around. You did not call.  Not for a long time anyway.  Don't steal, Mr. Moore.  Or at least ask permission.  There. I have made a political entry.

      It WAS Stacey calling me to tell me... she got the job!!! She will be working as an art teacher at a charter school in Maumelle (close to Little Rock).  I am so happy for her; she deserves a great opportunity like this!  But I will MISS my friend!!! We have worked together every Sunday since Jan. 2000.  We have traveled the world together, literally; we lived together for a month in beautiful Costa Rica.  We have gotten lost numerous times in Little Rock together.  We went to tons of hokey AmeriCorps meetings together because we were both members.  We worked across the hall from one another this year at school while she substitute taught for Ms. Kilcrease while she was ill.  This past Spring I was with her when she lost her tattoo virginity.  Me, being the tattoo whore, got my fourth the same night.  Good Times.  I am happy and sad.  I am a living oxymoron.

      So, yesterday I accomplished an amazing feat.  I began excavating Jane Claire's room.  I cannot understand where this child gets all kinds of crap. She is a little-Papaw. She writes notes and then hides them under her pillow.  She keeps EVERYTHING.  I also removed FOUR garbage bags of clothes that she has outgrown.  FOUR!  Some of them she got for Christmas!  I also have a HUGE tv sized box full of stuffed animals. Should I take them to helping hands or see if, like, Children's Hospital may want them?  I don't know.  Whatever happens, there will be plenty of toys to cuddle little children.  We watched Scarface the other night.  Don't hate me, Scarface fans, but I was SOOOO not impressed. And LONG!  Man, what a long movie.  All I really got a kick out of was Pacino's accent.   Is it still raining?  YES. IT IS STILL RAINING.  *Sigh*  I am very discouraged with most of these kids in summer school.  They are making very little effort.  It makes me sad.  I'm wearing my Viva La Bam "Don't Feed Phil" T-shirt today.  When one of the skater kids asked me where I got it, I told them Phil was my dad's 1st cousin and Bam and I were related.  They are so gullible. They were like, "You're related to BAM!!??"  Drooling.. eyeballs popping...   I couldn't continue the charade.  I told them "NO, y'all are so easy to fool."  It was great.    Stacey just called, but I couldn't answer because I'm in school. Maybe she has heard about her job interview.  Hope it is good news.

      It is so hard to enjoy a Saturday now that I'm an adult.  I hate shopping, so I don't want to go and do that.  If I take the opportunity to rest from the hectic week by watching television and laying around, I feel like the embodiment of   sloth  .  At least at the computer I feel like I'm doing something productive.  My house is clean right now, by the way (except for Jane Claire's room), so I don't have to worry about that.  The dog is driving me insane. Can animals be bipolar? If so, Scout definately qualifies.  Stacey came by to lay in the tanning bed, and she is going to start a blog for her art.  This new endeavor will at least give me something to do in the form of writing.  Hasta luego.

      Hey!  I decided to give blogging a try.  Since I don't have many interesting things to say right now, I decided to practice uploading pictures.  Then I got really carried away.  Lots of these pictures are older, and they are not in any sort of order. Keep looking, you may just find yourself in one of them! Love, gcb

             You Are   Whole Lotta Love            You are interested in 2 things in this world: Love and sex. You are a complete romantic (and probably a big whore.) You just want to be loved.  You really value your friends and your family, but more than anything, you value your boyfriend/girlfriend/husband/person you are stalking.  You don't necessarily value yourself very much, but it's ok because you will find someone else to value you. Sad, but you're oblivious, so it doesn't matter.   urlLink Take the Which Led Zeppelin Song Are You? Quiz    Seen over at  urlLink Stacey's

      I have some confessions to make.  #1 I heard a really good song the other day. It had a good beat. The words seemed somewhat meaningful based only on my half-listening. I thought to myself "This singer sounds familiar. I wonder who it could be?" Guess who it was.... um... no, it wasn't Britney, but God help me, I LIKE "Everytime"..... really, help me. Anyway, it was Avril Levigne's "My Happy Ending." Man, wasn't she just singing about sk8r boyz and crap? Not that this new song is a masterpiece, but dang, I was singing along, man. Maybe I'm too judgmental? Oh, and I like Ashlee Simpson's song "Pieces of Me" too. What's happening to me? Someone play Alice-In-Chains, quick!!!  #2 I don't know all of the words to "The Devil Went Down To Georgia." I am hiding my face in shame since the knowledge of those lyrics seems to be injected into the feet of southern infants at birth along with their vaccinations. However, I absolutely   adore   "Dixieland Delight." That vaccination seems to have "took" at the time of my birth. ("...little turtle dovin' on the Mason-Dixon line....") I sing along every time... sometimes I may do some foot stompin'--watchout!!!  #3 I've never read some really important books that English teachers are just supposed to have read.  The Grapes of Wrath, The Invisible Man, Pride and Prejudice , etc. I'm only reading Tolstoy's  Anna Karenina  right now because dang Oprah's book club is reading it, and I figure if all those Oprah-ites are going to be reading it, then dangit, I better have read it too! Fart! Instead of reading all that old stuff, I would rather be reading  urlLink Stephen King , of course.  #4 I don't like watching the news. So what? Give me my MSN homepage anyday.  #5 I still dislike people (1 or 2) who betrayed me like, 5 years ago. Grudge? Give it here, I'll hold it.  #6 I would totally hook up with Bam Margera. And Chris Pontius. (Steph, you can have Steve-O!)  #7 Right now I'm downloading songs. Isn't that illegal?  #8 I only make my bed if I know I'm having company who have never seen how fabulous I've decorated my bedroom. If you've seen it made once, you see it unmade every other time.  #9 I love to watch the show "Cheaters". I guess it makes me feel secure in my relationship. Hell, I just like the drama.  #10 It is now after midnight, and my suitcase still is sitting, STILL is sitting on the pallid bust of Pallas above my chamber door.... no wait, it is still in my kitchen. I had a Poe moment there.

      Jane Claire is going crazy.&nbsp; She's learning what sibling rivalry would be like if she were to have a sibling.&nbsp; She'll just have to settle for cousin rivalry.&nbsp; But how can I get on to someone that cute???&nbsp; See below.

      This past year I had a young girl in my class who had a great deal of problems.&nbsp; She was a beautiful girl.&nbsp; She had long red/blonde hair, almost with a pink undertone.&nbsp; She was quiet, too quiet really.&nbsp; She would sit in the very back of the room and sketch.&nbsp; Sometimes she would sleep.&nbsp;   She was a smart girl, but doing well in school was not a priority for her.&nbsp; Her mother was dead, and she and her brother had been removed from her father's custody (he lived somewhere up North) because he had not been able to control them.&nbsp; She told me herself that they never thought that the trouble they got themselves into would lead to them having to move away.&nbsp; It did.&nbsp; She and her brother were sent here to live with relatives.   Sometimes she would do her work, but most of the time she didn't.&nbsp; I could see her, struggling with some inner demon, sometimes shaking with anxiety, while I was trying to teach grammar or Harper Lee.&nbsp; I could tell that her conflicts would not allow her to worry about "trivial" matters such as school.   In February she was sent away to a recovery center for a few weeks after major anxiety attacks and what I believe was a possible suicide attempt.&nbsp; We were never given full details, only hints of what had happened.&nbsp; As for the anxiety, her attacks would be so extreme that she would have difficulty breathing and shook so hard she had trouble walking.   When she returned from her hospitalization, she was overmedicated.&nbsp; She had tremendous difficulty staying awake and her work became non-existant.&nbsp; There were some things she still cared about.&nbsp; Art was one of those things.&nbsp; She was a beautiful artist, with pictures and words.&nbsp; Her poetry (which she let me read a few times) contained so much anquish and regret.&nbsp; She had endured severe drug abuse, death,&nbsp;and so much loss.&nbsp;After reading her&nbsp;beautiful, sometimes scary words,&nbsp;I thought to myself "I have no clue what real suffering is."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes she would give me a smile, but more often there was silence, and occasionally tears.   She didn't come to summer school to make up any of her failed classes.&nbsp; I wondered what had become of her.   Today I found out.   I went to a local restaurant where she had worked before she went away to the hospital.&nbsp; As I opened the door to pick up our lunch, there she was.&nbsp; Smiling.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hi! How are you?"&nbsp; After I answered she said, "I have something to show you!"&nbsp; She went to the back and returned with a standard sized manilla envelope.&nbsp;   "High School Diploma" it read.   She had taken the preliminary tests to see if she required any courses, passed with flying colors, and was given the exam and did wonderfully.   "I'm thinking of going to college in the Fall," She added.   I am so  proud.    As a teacher, seeing smart students succeed is rewarding.&nbsp; However, seeing students, smart or not, struggle through adversity and  then  succeed is a gift.   I don't know if she could tell I was about to cry or not.&nbsp; I'm a sap like that.   "I'm SO very proud of you." I told her.   "Thank you. I'm proud too." She blushed.   She handed me my change, we exchanged goodbyes, and I left.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Poor  urlLink Scout . She's just creeping along, and I can tell she hurts. She's moving so slowly from place to place, and she didn't even bark to get out of her kennel this morning. I think she's depressed. Her little belly has that incision with stitches and it looks PAINFUL. You can tell from the pics below how sad she looks. However, I'm glad to know that I won't have to worry about her going into heat again. That was just gross. She will lead a pure life as a virgin. Sister Scouter. It has a certain holiness to it, doesn't it?    Meanwhile...    Ah, Donut Palace. You are no Shipley's or Krispy Kreme, but you are deliciously wonderful. I got just ONE chocolate filled today and a small carton of chocolate milk. I got up and walked this morning too, just so I could visit you. It all balances out, really.     urlLink Kaylee  is with us this weekend. (We get her every other weekend and some during the week) .  Remember, she is  urlLink my brother 's baby. Anyway, she is the cutest, baddest, sweetest, little booger. I may detail more about her parents later, but I may not since urlLink  my parent  urlLink s  have visited my blog before and they may get pissed if I air our dirty laundry in the blogging breeze.  But Kaylee LOVES Jane Claire.  They are so funny together.  She is going with us to  urlLink Heber Springs  on Monday for vacation.  It should be fun; thank God we have  urlLink Janie's new DVD player  to carry with us.   urlLink Bub  is also coming up to golf on the "championship course" (according to the  urlLink website ). That should be fun. Hopefully it won't be too crowded and we will have plenty of time to go out there and play (me - hack around with the clubs and maybe hit the ball some of the time).     July is ending. August will bring inservices and the start of school. This year will be very different because of the consolodation AND full inclusion of special education students. It is just our luck that both of these changes occur on the same school year. We will get by, however. I just don't ever want to lose my love of teaching. However, if I ever got a fabulous idea for a novel, I would write, publish, make a million dollars, and quit teaching so I could have plastic surgery all the time and hire a chef to make me delicious healthy foods. I would also have someone on hand to do my hair and make-up everyday. Oh, and a maid too.     Janie and I went on a bike (me) and scooter (her) ride awhile ago. Needless to say, that involved her scooting along at .001 miles per hour while I rode a ways then tracked back behind her. She said "Mom, I am SWEAT - ING so much!" I wonder if she will want to go tommorrow? Probably not, haha.    I also just got off the phone with Jane Claire's future Step-Mother, Lisa. It may be totally weird, but I really LIKE her. I like her 1,000,000 times more than I do my *gag* ex.  She  put me a check in the mail for child support today (because HE is always late with it - she make sure he gets it to me... see why I like her?). She is also going shopping and wanted to know what clothes Janie needed for school. In the past THEY always bought her clothes but would never let her bring them home. This generosity is another reason why I like Lisa. She also has two kids of her own, so she isn't "playing mommy" like his other (psycho) girlfriend was trying to do.    Anyway....    My new People magazine is here.  I must get my weekly celeb fix now.  And don't you just love my little weather pixie???

       I am foaming at the mouth to see this movie.&nbsp; I can't remember when it opens nationwide, but I'm hoping it is TONIGHT.&nbsp; However, the movie phone line is busy...busy...busy.     &nbsp;   Got through. It isn't on, but  The Bourne Supremacy  is playing and Bub wants to go see that.&nbsp; I never saw the first one, but it will at least get me out of the house.     &nbsp;   I would also like to express my UNDYING LOVE AND AFFECTION for  urlLink Stacey B. &nbsp; She has helped me see the err of my HTML ways, even though I still haven't gotten it right (those @%*!$#& buttons!!!) ... and she is the cutest little thing you have ever seen.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   I get to pick up my little Scouter today.&nbsp; I'm sure she is hurting and thinking we abandoned her.&nbsp; So sad.&nbsp; Every time Bub drives up I expect to hear her bark and yelp and do her circling psycho dance, but she's at the vet, and its weird.     &nbsp;   Me and Janie played Candyland earlier.&nbsp; I forgot just how cute that game is.&nbsp; I needed a break from the dad-gum html for awhile.     &nbsp;   Pretty soon I am going to return to typing actual things of interest, but for now, my brain is getting all mushy and rejecting any creative thought.     &nbsp;   Did I mention how much I LOVE  urlLink Stacey B ?

       Fa la la!&nbsp; I fixed it all.&nbsp; I guess it isn't too detrimental because I fixed my background in Mozilla too.    &nbsp;  I also have a NEW poll. Go vote!&nbsp; It's very important research.     &nbsp;  My counter is way at the bottom now, but that is where the counter website put it, and I'm not arguing with them using my "homegrown" html.    &nbsp;  However, my precious buttons do not work in Mozilla, but that is a battle for another day.    &nbsp;  I actually got out of the house today.&nbsp; I took Jane Claire swimming because M called and said no one would be home and we could come over.&nbsp; So I put my big ass in a bathing suit and take my book and my Janie.&nbsp; I had&nbsp;been lounging (tanning the fat) for about an hour and decided to get in the water and read my book at the edge.&nbsp; Well, THANK GOD, because C (a guy from high school) and some man came over&nbsp;to mow and weed eat....around the pool and in the back yard!&nbsp; I had to stay submerged until they were safely back around the fence.&nbsp; Yikes.    &nbsp;  Also walked again today and rode my bike a little (less than 1/2 mile, but it is something).    &nbsp;   Poor   urlLink  Scout    -  She's at the vet right now recovering from her spay.&nbsp; She looked pitiful as we were walking out the door.&nbsp; The receptionist was holding her and she looked at me like 'Are you leaving me? What did I do?'    &nbsp;  She's going to hate me.    &nbsp;  But, my blog is back!       &nbsp;   &nbsp;

       While you were existing happily in your day to day routine, an epic battle has been raging.    &nbsp;  Good versus Evil = Good (Me) versus&nbsp; Evil (My Blog).    &nbsp;  Sadly, evil triumphed.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  Look around.&nbsp; I have no counter, no blogroll, no ghost poll, no tag board, no BUTTONS.&nbsp; I am saddest about the buttons.&nbsp; I was so recently rejoycing their arrival.    &nbsp;  Alas, I will once again rise up to defeat the Dark Blog Lord.&nbsp; By then end of today I will have all of those things once more.&nbsp; All is not lost.

       You should have seen me doing my little victory dance when I got all my buttons posted and linked.&nbsp; Mozilla did the trick. Hoorah!&nbsp; So I go to Internet Explorer to check out how it looks.&nbsp; XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX&nbsp; that's what it looks like.&nbsp; So if you know what I'm doing wrong,&nbsp;lemme know. Meanwhile, enjoy the Xs if you are using IE, and enjoy the cute little buttons if you are using Mozilla.     &nbsp;   Hmf.     UPDATE    Rah hahahahaha!  I did it!&nbsp; I had to share the folder or some crap.&nbsp; Anyway, only two buttons work, but I will finish the rest of them!&nbsp; Whoo WhOO!&nbsp;&nbsp; *Funky dance*

      I am going to pull my hair out.&nbsp; I have been trying to add some buttons to my blog.&nbsp; I know how to link them and all that, I just can't figure out HOW the crap to save them to my server.&nbsp; At first I just copied and pasted, hoping that it would just happen to be that simple.&nbsp; Oh&nbsp;ho, ho, no!  So then I hop on the bike and ride to the library (remember, I'm in exercise mode here - and the library is a stone's throw from my house anyway) to see if they have any books on HTML. They did.&nbsp; They had one, and it was, of course,  HTML for Dummies. &nbsp; Should I have ever doubted?&nbsp; I hated to get it since it is for DUMMIES, but I had to.&nbsp; I guess I AM a dummy because the dad-gum thing didn't help much.  Anyway....  I'm downloading Moveable Type right now.&nbsp; Don't know if it will help one iota, but lots of other blogs have it, so at least I feel somewhat productive while it is downloading.  Anybody know how to get buttons?&nbsp; The ones I want are on  urlLink http://www.gtmcknight.com/buttons/ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the owner gave permission to "steal these buttons."  Ayudame! (Help Me!)

      Since I just returned from the AP conference in Fayetteville, I thought I would share some of the bloopers that appeared on this years AP exam.&nbsp; Keep in mind that these are the Advanced Placement high school kids, mostly 11 and 12th grade. These are from all over the United States, so no one is safe!    Many controversial issues are filled with controversy. That is why they are controversial.  Many San Dieagans are left-wing democrats like their president George Bush.  The purpose of marriage is to experience the gift of God--sex.  The music of the rocker, Marilyn Monroe, caused the Columbine tragedy.  In 1776, the Four Fathers wrote the Constitution.  Marijuana is less dangerous than pot.  Approximately 87-89% of the people in the world are Christians. Christians do believe in some kind of God, whether it be Buddha or a cow.  The universal fear of a girl is that she will never attract a male and die a virgin.  Jerry Falwell is a main public figurehead of the Catholic Church.  Many people voted for JFK because he was better looking than Reagan.  All Democrats are athiests.  Youth in Asia - killing a life before it is born.  The government should pass a lawto revoke licenses from the elderly, age 55 and above.  Society is split almost exactly in half over the question of the toilet paper roll. Solution: eliminate toilet paper.  Controversy: paper or plastic grocery bags. Solution: Papoplastic  Prada vs. Gucci? I's the biggest issue known to mankind. You only have $10,000 to spend on a bag, so which do you get?  Gay people deserve the right to vote.  If we blame violence on the gun, it would be like blaming the spoon for making Rosie O'Donnel fat.  Maybe Elton John should write another "I have a dream" speech.  It has been proven that an ER doctor has had more cheerleaders in his bed than football players.  Because of my neutral background in religion, I am a cat, forced to be given a bath.  Search warrants should be required. After all, someone could be naked in there.  The Pledge: Change 'one nation under God' to 'one nation under Canada and above Mexico.' It has a slight ring to it. . . .  Today you can find more hoe in&nbsp;one rap song than any Ace Hardware.  We are riding the hotrod to Hell . . . We must apply the brakes.&nbsp;  I think that's my favorite   Many students have the steriotype opinion of cheerleaders as "dumb blondes" but the humorous part of it is that many seem to graduate as the valet victorians.  Homosexuals are fighting for the right to marry themselves.  Whatever happened to the rule of no sex after marriage?  They have sex, and three months later, the girl is three weeks pregnant.  Males of either sex must go to war--and it's not fair!  It's an old person's war; we are interested in sex.   Don't you just love it?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   There were 296 of these too...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Oh!&nbsp; One kid said someone thought they were better than everyone else and that they were on a "pedal stool".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HA!

        Today has been very productive so far.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Went WALKING, yes WALKING this morning.&nbsp; More than a mile, yay!&nbsp; I need to get some better tennis shoes because the ones I have right now I bought a little small.&nbsp; I walked three miles about 4 months ago and the blister on my right foot was the size of a quarter.&nbsp; Grody.     &nbsp;     I also called the vet in Lake Village to get   urlLink  Scout       an appointment to get spayed on Tuesday.&nbsp; I'm hoping her "All living things are evil and must be destroyed" attitude will wane a bit.&nbsp; She is also getting her yearly shots, heartworm shot, and more flea medicine.&nbsp; All this is going to set me back about $200.&nbsp; Gah!     &nbsp;   Also, I am COOKING.&nbsp; For LUNCH.&nbsp; Yes, I know.&nbsp; You can slap me in cuffs and put me in the slammer for insider trading because  I AM Martha Stewart .     &nbsp;   I just haven't gotten around to finishing the laundry yet....     &nbsp;   Later today I have to trot up to the library and berate them for sending me a reminder card on a book I didn't check out.&nbsp; Mark Twain  The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.&nbsp;  I mean, come on, I'm an English teacher.&nbsp; I've got my own copy.&nbsp; It wasn't ME!     &nbsp;   **Walks to kitchen to stir the Hamburger Helper** --Did I say it was GOURMET cooking?&nbsp; No. I did not.&nbsp; Leave me alone.     &nbsp;   Ah, this is the most profound post I have ever penned (keyed).&nbsp; I will let you know if it wins any awards.

      Wow.  This week has been FULL.  I don't think I have rested much at all.  Classes are good. There are some annoying people who love to hear themselves talk and tell about how smart and innovative they are in their classrooms.  Other than that crapola, I'm learning a lot.  So far we have eaten at the Powerhouse, Shogun, and Shake's Ice Cream.  Shogun was this great Japanese place where they cook on the table right in front of you.  I took pictures, because that is what country bumpkins like myself do.    This $25.00 a day meal allowance is going to gain me 25 pounds.  Man!  Today we went on Dickson Street for awhile.  "Condom Sense" was a store we had some fun in.  I can't help but giggle like a jr. high kid in those places!  "HEHEHEHE!!! Look at THAT!!!"  My ears keep popping from the altitude.  I have to go down the hall to the community bathroom to shower and go to the bathroom. I have found the "secret" and "hidden" potty to get some privacy.  It's a talent I have; I knew all the bathrooms at UAM that noone ever went in.  I am going to post lost of pictures upon my return home.  Meanwhile, OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO PIG SOUIE!

      Whoo-eeee!  I am an official dorm resident and U of A!   My Spidey sense told me there were computers nearby!  I am sitting in a nice, clean, cool computer lab with fancy new dells and comfy chairs!!  And HIGH SPEED INTERNET!  Far cry from my HP, dial up, and crappy chair with a couch pillow to sit on!  Fayetteville is nice. This is my first trip.  The mountains are beautiful.  It's hard to believe my town and this place are in the same state.  They are just so different.  Anyway, hopefully I'll have access to this lab all week.

      My friend Joy has a theory.  The Wal-Mart Urge.  You know what I'm talking about.  Shopping happily in Wal-Mart, watching for 'falling prices', selecting necessary and totally UNnecessary items and placing them in your cart, and then.... it hits.  The Wal-Mart Urge.  The Urge to "USE IT".  You know,   Crap.  That's right, I said it.  Be lucky I didn't use the present tense of "shat".  What to do?    Abandon the purchases and drive home?  NO! Can't do that!   USE the Wal-Mart bathroom? *gasp in horror*  NO! Horrendous.   Hobble to the checkout with above mentioned purchases, doubled over in pain from  The Wal-Mart Urge , and race home?   That will have to do.   Don't tell me you don't know what I'm talking about.

      If ever there was a celebrity that I was more conflicted about it is Britney Spears.  I'll just start with the most recent shebang:    Who is this Kevin Federline - Father of one (almost 2) children with some woman?  Backup dancer?   3 Months of dating!!!  Come on!!!   My people magazine article quoted her as saying she wakes up in the morning, looks at her engagement ring (hello, she bought it herself from what E! claims) and thinks "Very Cool!"  How much more blatantly obvious can that comment be!  She doesn't wake up and think "I'm so lucky to be in love with a wonderful man!"  She thinks, neat-o, cool-io, wowie!  She also stated that she wanted 'four or five kids'.   I can't wait to see her body after those!  Being pregnant kinda slows down the body's ability to gyrate.  Someone should tell her that.  She also said she has started to LOVE cooking and CLEANING.  I'm sorry, some people may love to cook, but cleaning???  Shut up.  My theory about this egagement:  Britney wants to be Jessica Simpson. Not that Jess is a pro at any of those things (cooking, cleaning, etc) but America has fallen in love with Jessica's struggles, and Britney wants the same.  Ok, Britney's Vegas wedding.  "Just for fun!" Whooooooo-eeeee! Sounds like a regular party to me!  Can you say "I need publicity because my tour sucks!"?  Speaking of the tour "The Onyx Hotel" or whatever... my daughter, who had not even turned 7 yet, was SO excited about watching that on HBO.  MY DAUGHTER got pissed because she said "She's not really singing, Momma!"  When a 6 year old notices and is pissed, don't you think older fans would notice?  Also, I'm not against dancing.  I've danced since I was four.  But grinding on the ground and gyrating one's pelvis in a giant wine glass simulating sex is not dancing.  It's pseudo-masturbating to cover the fact that she's NOT really singing.  My guess is she sang the songs once, for the album recording, and hasn't sung them since.  Convenient that the knee injury happened when ticket sales were plummeting.  Now, honestly, don't get me wrong.  I used to tolerate, even kindof like Britney Spears.  She has some cute songs, and I even really like 'Toxic' - it's a jam, really!  But she's trying too hard.  Pick a platform, B.  You're either totally innocent and a role model for young girls who would NEVER sleep with Justin Timberlake, Colin Farrel, or Fred Durst -- OR -- You are a wild, crazy, Red Bull drinking, smoking, gyrating, lip sync-ing, serial marrier, who doesn't care what everyone thinks. (She said that last part in 'People' too).  P.S. I don't need comments from raving Britney fans saying "You're just jealous" because, sure, I'm jealous.  I don't have a body like hers, and I don't have her money.  Sure, I'll take both!  But Jessica Simpson has a great body and money too, and I just love her!  End of Rant!

      Summer school, oh, summer school To take you on, I was a fool. Lazy, rude, kids everyday, thank God, today, I got my pay.  But now the horror of you is done, The Super Bowl, I feel I have won! No more smelly, foul classroom; No more mornings filled with doom.  So tired am I of numbers and grades, some kids are dumber than wiper blades. Remind me next year to tell them "NO! I won't teach summer school NO MO!"  The End.

      I truly believe that if I had to come  one more day  to this school and teach  these kids  in this  stinking, bland, stark naked classroom  I would quit.  I  love  my job.  LOVEIT! But I do not love jr. high kids, nor do I love the jr. high school.  Other teachers have been supernice and the principal has been great.  I just hate it here.  This is not me.  I went to the high school (my territory) yesterday, and just the smell of it was comforting.  I didn't know how much I'd missed it.  AND!!!  Almost $600 taken out of my check for taxes and teacher retirement!  I was "taken aback" to say the least.  Oh well.  1 hour 58 minutes to go.

      So last night was Bunco.  I'm not an "official" member, but I am "official" substitute, and go almost every single month in someone's place.  (By the way, Bunco is a dice game with prizes at the end and food before, with lots of screaming women... AHHH!!! BIG BUNCO!!!  And a monkey on a necklace called Bunky Monkey...but I degress.)  One of the members moved about an hour away recently, but she still comes every month to play. This month we had to travel to her house.  What an ADVENTURE.  Never put four women in a car, my mother at the wheel, me in the passenger (map-reader) seat.  There was no map (yet), only directions written poorly through email.  We took the wrong turn and ended up nowhere near where we should have been.  Being women, we just stopped and asked directions.  This is the fun part:  Man in his 40's, orange shirt with sleeves ripped off, outside his house.  He looks like a Nascar fan. (DO NOT SEND EMAILS OR COMMENTS - I MEAN IT IN A NICE WAY!!!)  He tells us where to go and proceeds to GIVE us his nice, self folding, laminated map.  He opens the map - "Y'all are here.  Southeast Arkansas.  Town name deleted  is about 20 minutes South of here."  This is where you are going...." etc.. etc.     As we pull away, we laugh because we didn't tell him we were FROM that town 20 minutes "south of here."  We just let him think we were from Ohio or Delaware or something.    The funniest thing was as we were driving off, Bunco Queen #3 says aloud "We have time; they can't play without us!!!"  Lord knows what Jimbo-Bob Smith thought we were talking about.  He let us keep the fancy map.  He said "You know, cuz women always git lost and stuff."   It didn't make us mad.  We do get lost.  We got a neat-o map.  We were only about 45 minutes late, and I am still full.  And I won a prize.  Ah, Bunco.

      So yesterday was the big shindig, the big shebang, the whole hooplah.  May I also add that swimming parties are THE number ONE party to have. There is absolutely no entertaining to do on the party thrower's part.  I had to practically drag them all out to open presents and eat cake and ice cream.  Hell, I didn't even give them goody bags!! They didn't care.  Janie got $65!!! from those little kids, too!  That's just what I like for her to get... she doesn't need anymore toys.  She bought two Scooby Doo DVDs and a Spiderman Deluxe edition with 3 discs today at Kroger.  She doesn't waste any time!!!  By the way....   Two more days until Summer School is over!!!   I am so tired of it.  5 weeks from 8:00 (I get there at 7:30) to 2:30 is the most hellacious thing I have ever endured!  Here's what I do each day:  1.  Wake up at 6:30 and possibly snooze until 6:39. 2.  Let out stupid dog because she won't shut up.  Call her      for 5 minutes until she casually strolls back in the house. 3.  Shower, dress, and wake up Janie and dress her. 4.  Take Janie to Pre-K (Which she HATES - she says they make them     play in the "Hot BOILING Sun") 5.  Pick up Eddie, 8th grade summer school kid who lives down     the street. 6.  Arrive at school.  Exhale huge sigh of desperation and accept     my fate for the day. 7.  8:00 - Class starts.  Silently berate stupid 9th graders who      will drive me crazy and not do much work all day. 8.  11:00 - Lunch.  Pay $2.00 for crappiest-meal-ever or refuse      and starve.   9.  2:30 - Breathe sigh of relief and make mad dash for exit     doors. 10. Pick up Janie and go home and count the days until Summer      School is over.   Fun, huh?

      I have  the  best boyfriend.  He's a really serious golfer; he's really good too.  So what does this really serious and good golfer do today?  He takes me with him to the course to hack it up a little bit.  First of all, there are TONS of people there since today is an official holiday.  The sun is boiling hot, and there is mud with gnats and weird bugs here and there.  But he lets me tee off - or try to.  After two or three swing and miss attempts I finally hit it.  It rolls about 80 yards (did I tell you that this was with the driver?)  Anyway, at almost every hole he holes his put, and then lets me practice 5 or 6 times. This makes us go extremely slow, but we really can't go faster anyway because there are 4 slow people playing in front of us.  I suck.  He doesn't care though.  He just laughs and says "Nice drive there, Deb."  (Debbie is the terrible golfer whom we saw last year... we didn't really know her name, so we named her Debbie.  She just looked like a Debbie.  She was still probably better than me, though.)  Anyway, I'm second best golfer in the world on the PlayStation Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004.  Guess who is the first!   I Just Love Love Love That Bub

      So about two years ago, Jane Claire's MitMit (KennyRay's Mom) bought her a tiny little hamster.  It was no bigger than those teeny white mice that people buy for their snakes to eat.  Janie named "her" Daphne.  Mit also bought one hamster for Raven and one for Zachery (Candie's kids - Bub's sister).  Candie, being the clean house nazi she was bred to be, and deciding to make their stinky cage extra fresh, wiped down their little home with Clorox.  Sadly, Raven and Zachery's hamsters met an untimely death.   However, Daphne continued to thrive as I am not the neat freak Candie is.  Some fresh mulch stuff and hamster is good to go. Anyway, eventually it became apparent that Daphne was inappropriately named.  How did we know, you may ask? Because his nether-regions grew to the size of basketballs.  Well, almost.  So Daphne became Charlie.  He's a wiley fellow. When the top of the cage is off (the top being a barbie folder - the cage being a plain old aquarium) he can climb the mountain of mulch and hook his little paws over the side and plunge towards the floor.  He roams freely until he gets hungry.  The first time he went missing I didn't know what to do.  I just looked and looked and after a few days expected to find him dead somewhere.  Early one morning I heard him scratching behind my bed.  I quickly captured him, returned him to his cage (aquarium) and replaced the top (put the barbie folder back over it).  He's gotten out a few times since then, but I discovered that if I put a box upside down beside the cage, he will climb on top and get back in.  What a star.  He knows where his food and water are, pretty smart for a big balled hamster, don't you think?  Anyway, the main reason I wanted to relay the story of Charlie is because of his disgusting yet amazingly, freakishly huge nuts.  Sorry to be crass, but they are. They are nuts.  Have a look for yourself.

      No, I'm not going to talk about Brad Pitt's glorious performace in the creepy thriller movie, although that may be interesting in the future.... hm.  Seven is how old my daughter is today.  Seven years old. Wow.  Seven years seems like eons to me.  My mom used to tell me that human taste buds change every seven years. Who knows if that is true, but she is a dental hygenist, so she knows a lot about mouths.  I too have changed so much in these past seven years.  When I think back on who I was before Janie was born, all I can remember is that I was a child.  Pregnant at 17 and giving birth at 18 probably isn't that astonishing now that teen pregnancy rates are so high, especially since this past year I have had several students  (11th graders) give birth to their  second  child. However, going through such a life changing event that young was scary for me.  I wish someone would have told me how wonderful it would be.  Jane Claire is such a good child. I always say that I won't have anymore children because I can't get as lucky with a second child as I got with her.  I like to attribute her good behavior to my fabulous parenting skills, but nah, its just luck, I'm sure.  If I had another one he/she would probably be like my brother.  EEEEK!!!  She's starting 2nd grade this year.  I'm terrified.   Ten years from now she will be a senior.  These seven years have flown by; I can't imagine how fast the next seven will go.  Will she be smart? Funny? Shy? Will she belong to the foreign language club? Student Council? The band? Will she be a cheerleader, or will she play softball?  What college will she go to?   Will she hate me for not wanting to buy her a car when she turns 15?  I never want her to drive!  It's too dangerous!  I can totally  understand my parents' point of view now.  Being a parent is hard; being a good parent is terrifying.  I am constantly questioning myself.  I look at people like my niece's mother and wonder "What in the WORLD are they thinking?"  How can people throw their lives away and forsake their children?  There are so many loving, wonderful people in this world who are desperate to be parents.  There are also sorry, rediculously irresponsible people who are reproducing every 9 months.  It just makes me sad.    I hope that I can be the mother Janie deserves.  I hope that one day she can look at me with respect, admiration, and unconditional love.  I hope she doesn't give me as much trouble as I gave my mother when I was in jr. high school.  Man, I shiver just thinking about the possible payback!  For now, I will enjoy my little seven year old chunky monkey, who loves Sonic, loves to dance, talks in her sleep and shaved her eyebrow off.  Happy Birthday Jane Claire. I love you, sweetpea.

      In honor of school starting tommorrow, I though I would post my favorite student story. Names of people and local places have changed to protect the innocent... and the guilty!!! ha! ------------------  I almost didn’t teach because of summer school 2001. As a single mother trying to make ends meet, I eagerly jumped at the chance to make some extra money and get my proverbial teaching feet wet by taking on the 2001 summer school English course at High School High School. I was given a stack of different novels, a box of worksheets and tests, and twenty five students who would rather lick chalk dust than show up in my classroom at 7:30 a.m. for four weeks during the summer.  This summer was my first introduction to Calvin, an energetic, yet exasperating sixteen year old. He was taking summer school because he had failed English; he had failed several English classes. He never had a disrespectful or negative attitude, and the perpetual smile on his face only left when he was talking up a storm…… or falling asleep. He made me want to laugh hysterically and pull my hair out simultaneously. He really wanted to be quiet, but he couldn’t. One morning he taped his own mouth shut; however, he soon discovered that taping his mouth shut prevented him from talking! The tape came off quickly. After he asked me (with wide eyes and the mischievous Calvin grin I had come to know) to be his "baby’s mama" and giggled with embarrassment, I realized that although I had never taught before, it would be a long time before I ever had a student like Calvin again.  My internship year and Calvin’s senior year began in August 2001; I was interning with CM, the senior English teacher, and Calvin would be in our regular English class. One of the first things she told me was that she felt that she wasn’t able to give the regular classes the extra push they needed because of the work load of preparing the academic and honors classes for college level work; she wanted me to focus most of my attention on the two regular classes that she felt could use an extra "something." I began with fury; I was going to adopt these kids as my own and teach them about life, work and English! I soon discovered that the idea of "reaching" all of these students was, although admirable, impossible.  Something about Calvin kept me focused on him, however. He was not a good student; he turned in late papers if any. He cracked jokes in class, or he simply talked……and talked…… and talked……. Towards the end of the first nine weeks I began to notice a shift in his carefree demeanor; I could tell he was frustrated with something. School? Maybe. Life? More likely. He had a girlfriend, but they seemed to have a volatile relationship at best. He could see that his grades and lack of credits were probably going to prevent him from graduating. Not long after Halloween, Calvin didn’t show up for school. When I asked where he was I found out he was in jail. He and his girlfriend had been fighting, literally, and Calvin was arrested. I wasn’t sure if there were any legal boundaries to visiting or calling students in jail, so I waited. I was extremely relieved when he showed up back at school. Calvin was becoming more angry about life; he didn’t understand why he was losing control of something that he had found so enjoyable before. The "real world" was looming months ahead, and Calvin knew he was not giving himself a very good chance at becoming successful. He had failed his first semester of senior English, which was not good because he still had a semester to make up from the previous year. Graduation looked more and more impossible. A few weeks into the semester, Shani, his girlfriend, told me the news: Calvin had given up and dropped out of school. I was so disappointed; my "mission to save the world" had failed. I wanted to at least let him know that he had been special to me. I’m still not sure why exactly, but he was. I wrote him a short letter, telling him he could become someone in life and not to give up hope even though he had taken this major life changing step. I was hoping he would attempt to get his G.E.D. or find a respectable job somewhere. My worst fear was to see him aimlessly walking the streets of High School Town wearing baggy jeans and clutching a Newport for years to come. I didn’t tell him those fears, but I wanted to convey the sense urgency I felt for his future. I also told him that I really cared about him, and that he had changed my ideas about teaching and about "hopeless" students as well. I signed it with an "I love you", folded it, and asked Shani to give it to him, hoping that she would. I wanted him to know that someone at that school besides his friends cared that he was gone. I continued with my "mission" for the next few days, hoping to "save" at least one kid from failing. Failing in English or failing in life, whichever I could.  Thursday morning, the sheepish grin greeted me at the door of the classroom; Calvin had re-enrolled. He didn’t say what made him come back, but later on that week he did thank me for the letter. I don’t believe my letter was the magic key, but I like to think it was the little extra something that let him know that he was important in our school. After class one day, I noticed he was still sitting in his desk; I walked beside it and crouched down so that we were eye level. "What is it, Calvin?" I asked. He looked at me without the smile I had grown to love and said, "I don’t think I can make it, but I don’t want to be a bum. I don’t want to walk the streets for the rest of my life." My eyes welled up with tears and a baseball sized lump immediately lodged in my throat; he had just verbalized what I had been fearing all along. I told him (through my choked up voice) that he wouldn’t be a bum because he knew that was the wrong choice; I told him that there were a lot of "bums" that never made the conscious choice to not be one. I told him that he was capable of doing anything he wanted; I also told him that I did see something in him that was different, a "light" that he had inside of him. I expected him to laugh because what I had said was so cheesy, but he didn’t. He seemed hopeful. Later on that week he wrote to me that no one had believed in him, not his mother, his girlfriend or his principal. No one believed in him but me; he said no teacher had ever cried over him, and he realized that someone did think he could succeed.  Calvin’s return to school and our "heart to heart" was not the magic turnaround I had expected, however. He did work hard to make up the work he had missed, and he came in during his own time for help. However, late in the second semester, a second argument at school between Calvin and Shanti led him to In School Suspension. While students are given the opportunity to continue their normal classwork in ISS, it is difficult for them to do well because they are not being taught the material. Because Calvin was pretty low performing when it came to English, my hopes for his success were slim once again.  The last few days of school for the seniors are hectic. One of the final assignment in the senior English class is their final "process speech." Students are to pick something like cooking, woodworking, or any other process that requires steps and materials. Calvin was given this assignment while in ISS and would return to class only to present his speech. The day he was brought over, he watched several of his classmates go before him. After about the third speech, I saw him get out of his desk and walk out of class. I followed. His eyes were almost teary, but not quite. He explained that he didn’t understand the assignment; he had intended on "freestyling a rap"; he soon realized this was not appropriate for the assignment. He was embarrassed and did not want to give his speech. He said he didn’t know how to do or make anything. I knew he had come to far to give up; I told him I would make him a deal. I would give him a recipe for a simple Ro-Tel and chicken casserole, and I would bring the ingredients if he promised to study the process and write his speech. He agreed, and the following Wednesday I showed up with a Kroger sack of ingredients, and Calvin showed up with his speech. It went perfectly. He even seemed to feel comfortable enough to incorporate his own "Calvin" humor in his speech. Mrs. M gave him an "A" for presentation.  The final test for Calvin was to pass the second semester of English IV. He still had two semesters to make up, and failing again would make him totally ineligible for graduation. His final exam grade was a 67, which brought his average up to a 60.3. He had passed. I found him in a hall and said with a grave voice "Calvin, we need to talk about your grade." He looked at me and said "I didn’t pass, did I?" I couldn’t be mean any longer; I said "Well, YEAH! You DID!!!" He literally jumped two feet in the air and then hugged me like he had won the Super Bowl. He had passed.  Again, there were still two semesters of English to be made up. I still was worried because I would not be teaching summer school that summer, and I didn’t know if a "strict" teacher would be able to look past his "energy" and see that "light" I could see. He also had to enroll in the local adult education class to make up the other semester. Two English classes was going to be a tough road for Calvin. School let out for summer, and I left for a month long trip to Costa Rica. When I got back I heard that Calvin had passed with flying colors and received his diploma. I was elated.  I wasn’t sure where he went after graduating, but I knew he wasn’t "bumming" around Hamburg. School started, and I began my first year as a "real" teacher. One afternoon in November 2002, there was a knock at my classroom door. I opened it, and there stood Calvin, standing at parade rest in his crisply ironed Marine uniform. For the second time in Calvin's life, a teacher cried for him. I told him how handsome, successful, and important he looked; I told him I was so proud of the person he had become, he grinned and said he never could have become that person had it not been for my encouragement. I said "See! I told you! I knew you could do it!" and all of those other phrases that proud people say when there is nothing that really expresses their absolute joy of seeing something happen that might never have. Recently I emailed his mother to ask how he was doing. Imagine my surprise when she emailed back that he was awaiting his orders to be moved to the White House as part of the Military guard stationed there. Calvin P, the skinny kid who spent some of his senior year in jail and ISS, was now partly in charge of the White House. The idea was almost scary!!! After the war began, Calvin wrote back home to our local paper, asking citizens to write letters of support to the troops serving in Iraq. My classes wrote letters in response to his request. Calvin had not only taken control of his own life, but he had become concerned with others’ lives as well. Calvin is now serving in Japan, far, far away from the "streets of High School Town" he feared so much. I don’t believe that I changed his life; however, I do believe that I provided him with much needed support during a difficult time in his life when he felt that no one was going to bat for him.  Every teacher/student relationship has the potential for this kind of support, but achieving such a bond with every student, or even more than a couple of students, is impossible. While I believe that I am a good teacher who is deeply concerned with the well being of my students, I do not believe I have had such a drastic effect on a student since Calvin. Hopefully, I will be able to offer a support system that encourages other at-risk students in the future, but again, I believe it is physically and emotionally impossible to achieve this goal with every student, every year. The most important lesson I think that teachers can learn from these experiences is the idea that if each teacher helped one at-risk student each year, the dropout rate could decrease significantly. This accomplishment could lead to a "domino effect" of positive factors stemming from having less dropouts, including less crime, drugs, suicide, and many other social problems affecting our country’s youth today.

       Notice the time.  I've been up for 20 minutes, have already fixed Janie breakfast and let the dog out.   You can tell I'm getting busy -- even though I don't  have  to go up to the school today.  I got tons of stuff done yesterday, but I still have to clean out my desk and get new desk supplies. Then I have to work on my lessons. ECK.  Tommorrow we have a scheduled inservice, so I won't be in my room for the majority of the day.  Today is also Janie's open house.  We already know who her teacher is, but we get to go up there and visit with her, see the classroom and find out what other kids are in her class.  Speaking of Janie, she came home yesterday from her every other weekend obligatory custody visits completely banged up.  She has a bruised jawbone, a bruise and scratches under her chin, a 6 inch long, 2 inch wide bruise on her left under arm, and equally long scratches under her right arm.  Her "legal" (that's what I call my ex) pushed her too hard in those swings that go in a circle, she flew out and skidded and landed face first.  Pissed?  Noooooooo.... not MEEEEE!    (Actually, Bub was more furious about it, if that is possible.)   I know he (legal) didn't mean to do it, but it is just another example of how much of a dumbass he is.  By the way, Stephanie and I missed a few days walking because our work schedules conflicted, but we started back up yesterday.   I'm stuck at 8 pounds, but I'll hopefully be  losing more once school starts.  Sorry for the boring post, but I hate to leave the same one up for days and days.  I'll be posting classroom pics within the next two days.  I'm proud of it, anyway.

      A young girl in our community died yesterday.  She was driving down the highway and somehow crossed the center line and hit an 18-wheeler.  This occurred in the early daytime, before lunch on a Saturday.  I didn't know her, but she was from the school we consolodated with, and would have been attending our school for her senior year.  She worked at one of the local grocery stores and was involved in rodeo.  Why do things like this happen?  I mean, I know there are drunks who get killed, reckless drivers, and weather conditions that cause accidents, but this was so random.  A freak accident with no reason.  Bub and I were driving down that same highway later that afternoon.  There were cars parked along the highway with teenagers crying and holding flowers.  She was so young.  She was probably excited and nervous about being a senior, starting a new school, beginning a new chapter in her life.  Maybe she had decided on what college she would attend; maybe she had a boyfriend that she wanted to have children with someday.  Living in such a small community makes tragedies like this seem to happen more often because whether you know the person or not, you know a friend of theirs, a relative, or you've seen them in passing.  It also makes me realize how mortal we all are.  I mean, I realize that we are all going to die, but I don't ever realize that it could be anytime.  I expect my mother and father to be 100 years old before they take their last breath.  I expect to live to 100.  I expect my daughter to live to 100 and her children and their children to live to 100.  I WANT that gaurantee.   Why can't I have it?  Thinking of our mortality terrifies me too much.  Where is the line?  We can't be so afraid to die that we don't live our lives, but dang.  It's like a slap in the face when things like this happen.  "Wake up! You could DIE!"   I just wish I wouldn't get slapped like this quite so often.

       School starts in less than a week.... Thursday the 19th.  Ordinarily I wouldn't really stress out because I have most of my year planned out already.  Adjustments are easily done.   However, this year our department did a lot of switching due the consolidation of a small nearby school district, an unusually large number of students moving up from the jr. high, and full inclusion of special ed.   Instead of teaching 5 junior English classes, I will now teach 2 junior English classes, one Pre AP sophomore class, and two sophomore English classes.  No problem there either except...  I haven't read one dad gum thing from the 10th grade book.  I just haven't felt like it.  Now don't get me wrong... one week from now I will be 100% prepared.  I always am.  But man, talk about procrastination.   I do have copies of the last years teachers' syllabi, so I have a good idea of what to teach -- I just have to read it.      Blech.  My favorite part is cleaning up my room.  Unlike the elementary teachers, we do not have to remove all the stuff from our walls from year to year.  My classroom is walpapered with movie posters.... movies that are books.  I will post pictures once I get all the old crap thrown away and  a new bulletin board.

         Let's see how many of these I can identify with, shall we??? I'll put a * beside them.        You know you're a child of the 80s if...               You've ever ended a sentence with the word "PSYCH!"     *    You watched the Pound Puppies .      * (I had the stuffed animals too!!)    You can sing the rap to the "Fresh Prince of Bel Air."   *Now this is a story all about how my life got flipped turned upside down, so I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there... I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air. In West Philadelphia, born and raised, on the playground was where I spent most of my days. Chillin’ out, maxin’, relaxin’ all cool, and then shootin’ some b-ball outside of the school. When a couple of guys -- they were up to no good! Started makin’ trouble in my neighborhood. I got in one little fight and my mom got scared. She said “You’re movin’ with your Auntie and Uncle in Bel Air. (I could go on….)    You wore biker shorts under your skirts and felt stylish .     * Felt?  I WAS man.    You yearned to be a member of the Baby-Sitters Club and tried to start a club of your own.    *Did that too!  Our club was KIDS Inc.  - then Disney Channel stole it.  I should sue.    You owned those little Strawberry Shortcake pals scented dolls .  *    You know that "WOAH" comes from Joey on Blossom .     *I thought he was hot.    Two words: M.C. Hammer .     *Break it down~~~~ STOP!   Hammatime!    If you ever watched "Fraggle Rock ." *Oh my YES... Remember the Gorgs?    You had plastic streamers on your handle bars .  *Pink, baby.... always pink!    You can sing the entire theme song to "Duck Tales. "    *Here in.. DUCK BURG!    You remember when it was actually worth getting up early on a Saturday to watch cartoons . *It was all over when Soul Train came on!    You wore a ponytail on the side of your head .     *Hello!  And it was CRIMPED too!    You saw the original "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" on the big screen.    *TOTALLY!    You got super-excited when it was Oregon Trail day in computer class at school . *I was always a computer geek.    You made your Mom buy one of those clips that would hold your shirt in a knot on the side.   *I had all shapes    You played the game "MASH" (Mansion, Apartment, Shelter Shack, House).   *It was a religion, man.  Played that for YEARS!    You wore a Jordache Jean jacket and you were proud of it.     *Had a jean jacket, don't remember the brand.    L.A. Gear.. .       *Shivering from the memory....    You wanted to change your name to "JEM" in Kindergarten.   *TRULY outrageous!    You remember reading Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing and all the Ramona books.   *Judy Blume was my HERO    You know the profound meaning of "WAX ON, WAX OFF."   *DANIELSAN!    You wanted to be a Goonie.    *Goonies never say DIE!    You ever wore fluorescent clothing .    *Pictures from those days still hurt my eyes!    You can remember what Michael Jackson looked like before his nose fell off .  *Thriller scared the piss out of me!    You have pondered why Smurfette was the only female smurf.   *CoughCoughSLUTCoughCough    You took lunch pails to school.      *Star Wars    You remember the CRAZE, then the BANNING of slap bracelets.   *Mine was hot pink.    You still get the urge to say "NOT" after every sentence.      *Not still, but man did I ever use that one.    You remember Hypercolor T-shirts.    *I've still got the pics.  Those things were GRODY    Barbie and the Rockers was your favorite band.     *Not favorite, but Barbie was my homegirl.    You thought She-Ra and He-Man should hook up.    *Back then boys were GROSS... wait, they still are.    You thought your childhood friends would never leave because you exchanged friendship bracelets.     *The braided ones!  We also had necklaces with broken hearts that fit together.    Y  ou ever owned a pair of jelly shoes.  *I still remember the feeling of dirt in those things, and the slimy black crud between my toes after playing all day!    After you saw Pee-Wee's Big Adventure you kept saying "I know what you are, but what am I?"     *Still a classic.   FRAN-CES!!!!!    Tell em LARGE MARGE sent ya!

You remember boom boxes vs. CD players .  *    You remember watching both "Gremlins" movies.  * Gizmo was so cute.  Remember, I skated with him.

You remember Alf, the lil furry brown alien from Melmac.   *    You remember New Kids on the Block when they were cool.  *Went to the concert. I was going to marry Joe M.    You knew all the characters names and their life stories on "Saved By the Bell," the ORIGINAL class.   * STILL know them.

      Jane Claire had a "dance" to go to last night.  It was really just a sock hop theme birthday party, but there were over 70 kids invited.  She's going to 2nd grade, and there were kids as old as 4th and 5th there too.  Anyway, she just looked way too grown up.

        Ok, so I'm back to normal today.  I hate when I throw myself a pity party; I mean, who wants to come to those?  The big weight loss crusade is still underway. I've lost 6 pounds and have been walking 3 miles a day. I could have easily punked out on Stephanie this morning because I am keeping  urlLink Kaylee  today through Wednesday. But I didn't; I loaded her up into the most difficult to steer stroller ever and walked. It was really hard too, because I couldn't really walk that straight and I couldn't do very long strides, so I would end up pushing with one hand some and walking kindof beside the thing. After the second mile, we stopped at my dad's office (which is on our route) and let her see him for the last mile. We both figured that pushing that thing probably burned even more calories. Probably.  I went to the Sonic a little while ago to get a grilled chicken sandwich. No coke, no fries, just grilled chicken. Of course they give me a fried (breaded) chicken sandwich. Well, normally I would have just eaten it because I like those better anyway, but I am being good. I turned around at the car wash and headed back. Good girl. And I know Sonic grilled chicken sandwiches probably aren't the best diet food, but if that is my only main meal of the day, there is no way I have eaten more than 1200 or even 1000 calories.  Anyway, I know people sometimes don't want to hear about dieting woes, so I'm going to try and refrain from obsessing about it on this blog. I have joined another blog that I may post on from time to time.  urlLink Hip Momma  started it, and you can view it  urlLink here . It is also on my blogroll under the name  urlLink Taking Control .  I haven't posted anything yet, but I intend to.  By the way, the only reason I am able to type right now is that Kay-Poo is BLISSFULLY asleep. She refused to take a nap earlier, so we got in the car just to get out of the house for awhile and she went out like a light.  House news: Nothing much new except the hole patching and painting of rooms has begun. Hopefully it won't take forever. Bub went over there today and weed-eated, cleaned off the deck, and sprayed Roundup around the fence. J probably would have done all that, but I think Bub likes to have manly projects like that, especially at the new house. I've packed 2 boxes of framed pictures and useless knicknacks. Go me.  So how are you?

       Sometimes when Jane Claire goes to my mom and dad's house, she will get out old home movies and watch them.  She especially likes watching the video of her birth.  (Well, not the actual birth, but a few hours before and then after.... I would NEVER have allowed any filming of the actual BIRTH to be filmed.)  Anyway, I went to get her today and she had just turned on that tape.  To me, that tape is like a car wreck... you can't not look, even though it disgusts you.    I know, I know.... What am I talking about?  How can my daughter's birth disgust me?  It doesn't.  Not at all.  What disgusts me is ME.  I watch that video and become terribly sad and disgusted at the same time.  I look at that girl with four chins, huge lactating boulder boobs, and a hospital gown that won't stay closed, and I feel so sorry for her.  Not just because she's fat, but because of the three years of hell she is about to endure with her seemingly innocent husband sitting in the rocking chair by her side.  Not once in that video is he holding her hand or sending words of comfort.  He is probably thinking about how long until his next joint, or his next rendezvous with his hoochie of the moment.  I look at that baby Jane Claire and think "Why don't I feel any joy when I see myself on this video?"  I love watching  her;  she was and still is my precious pride and joy.  However, I think the reason I don't want anymore children is for the simple fact that I am so emotionally scarred from the experiences that came with being pregnant, such as stupidly getting married when I knew there were other girls (not women, mind you... girls), drugs, and half assed feelings on both of our parts.  Also, the weight issues that I still carry to this day because of the person I saw in the mirror for so long arose from that time in my life.  A secondary reason is the pain I endured: urinary tract infections during the pregnancy, the actual birth, and the excruciating weeks of recovery following giving birth.  Finally, I feel guilt for feeling all of the abovementioned feelings in the first place.  Of course she was worth everything.  EVERYTHING.  Why do I feel so depressed everytime I watch it?  I look at that scared, naive, and hopeful girl, and I want to sit down with her.  I want her to be who I am NOW.  I don't want her to endure the hardships that face her in those next three years.  But she will.  And she will survive.   But it still makes me depressed as hell.

       This post may be boring, but for the sake of updating, I decided to go for it anyway!   Diet Day 4:   5 pounds lost.... 3 miles walked (yeah, we took it up a notch because we're superwomen) O Hershey Huggs 47,865 Bottles of water  That's progress, right?  I am also learning all about house buying STUFF.   I accomplished several things today in that area.  I got my application for homeowners insurance ready for the title company, switched my car insurance to the same company (and I saved a bundle!  Like the commercial... only it wasn't Geiko) , chose the title company, cancelled my old car insurance policy, gave my notice to vacate my house, and set up a termite inspection.   Am I a grownup or what?  We also went over to the new house because the owner (who is also our buddy) wanted us to check the paint colors before they painted.  Bub and J also moved out the humongous counter and a couple of other big things... which was probably the reason J called in the first place, under the guise of "come see the paint" haha!  I ate some pieces of fried shrimp tonight.  Considering that I haven't had ANYTHING fried or even fattening in the last 4 days, my stomach was TOE-UP.  That shrip was dad-gum good, though.  I also keep realizing that I am going to have to MOVE!  I HATE packing and moving!  Oh, well.  That's what boyfriends with trucks are for.

      Recently, MTV has been airing a show called “The Social History Of…” I especially liked watching the one about the social history of the tattoo. Why? Well, you see…  Even though I am a high school English teacher…  Even though I work at a church on Sundays…  Even though I am a mother…  I have tattoos. Several tattoos.  So I decided I would regale the history of my own ink. Mainly to show that tattoos can be meaningful and beautiful, but also to show that they can be a mistake sometimes.  So the story begins….   The Virgin Tattoo   I was about 20 when I got my first tattoo. It was a spur of the moment idea that my ex-husband, best friend Shauna, her husband Gerald, and I had one night when we were out. (This was when I was living in Mississippi.) We went to a place that was called “Gypsy’s”, and I guess we should have known then that it may not be the best place. However, it was very clean and the instruments and tattoo room were very sterile. The only problem was she SUCKED at tattoos. We didn’t know it at the time, of course. None of us had ever gotten a tattoo before. Shauna chose a small flower for the back of her shoulder, Gerald chose a yin yang with fire and water or something on his back, the ex chose a tribal thing for between his shoulder blades, and finally I chose something that looked like a sunburst for my left ankle.  *Here is my tale of caution!*  Never just “go get a tattoo!” You will have this on your body forever, so you need to know IN ADVANCE what you want.  So we all get our tattoos. A few days go by, and I realize that mine is crooked and all lopsided and asymmetrical! The colors, which were supposed to go from red to orange to yellow (as in.. the spectrum!) went from red to yellow to orange! FAK! Shauna eventually got hers tattooed over, since hers faded. I don’t know if the ex ever did anything about his because, well he’s my ex now. (Shauna, did Geraldo ever get his changed at all?) Anyway, regardless of the outcome… I had my first tattoo. By the way “Gypsy” died a few years later from a drug overdose… gah! Tattoos can be an addiction. I immediately began wanting another on. However, it was a long time before I did.   The Post-Divorce New Woman Tattoo   I began to think about tattoo number two soon after I got divorced. I wanted something meaningful, not trendy or just cute. I didn’t like the idea of writing words on my body, but I wanted something that was symbolic of this time in my life. I began to look at Chinese symbols for various words. This time my other best friend (in Arkansas - remember I moved back after the Deee vorce) Candie (Bub’s sister) and her new boyfriend - now husband - went to Bastrop, Louisiana to Greg’s. Greg’s sounded a little less floofy than “Gypsy’s”. This time I chose a small symbol. It was the symbol for Spring, you know, the season? I figured that was a good metaphor. Ok, English class… usually in literature Spring is the time of rebirth. A time of new growth and starting over. If you ever read a novel, notice the seasons in which things occur…  The Great Gatsby  for instance… the beginning of the novel is full of liveliness, love, parties, and carefree jubilation - all of this occurs during the Spring and into the Summer. The end (which I will not reveal) occurs in the Fall, when things are dying and winter is coming. Anyway… I wanted to signify to myself that I was starting over; this transition from verbally abused wife to Empowered Single WOMAN was my rebirth. I got the small symbol on the small of my back. That area seems to be very popular now, but then, I just wanted it to be somewhere only I could see. This one was not for display.   The Tribute to My Daughter Tattoo(s)   My thirst for skin ink had not slaked. I continued to think about what I wanted next. I wanted some kind of tribute to my daughter, but I just didn’t think it was me to have her name or picture (like Eminem, haha) on me! I decided to go with the Chinese symbols again, only because I liked the first one so much, and I wanted to incorporate that into my “new woman” (hehe) tattoo. I chose to have the symbols for J-A-N-I-E tattooed around the rebirth/Spring tattoo. (Jane Claire would have been too dang many symbols, y’all - we call her Janie mostly anyway.) That worked out pretty well. This time Candie, her cousin, and I got ours in Monroe, Louisiana at Ink Slingers. This shop was much nicer than the first two, and was operated more like an establishment instead of a tattoo “parlor”. I use this tattoo to shock my students… when they ask how many I have I can say EIGHT… because the symbols are all separate. I guess I only have four really though since those five letters are really part of one. Its fun to see their faces though!   The Final Tattoo (for now, I say!)   I’m finally where I want to be in life. I’m no longer a broken ex-wife; I’m still a mother, but I have also found out who I am as a woman - an individual. I got my last tattoo this past year. This one was just for me. I wanted something that was part of my personality. My absolute favorite color is PINK. Pink Pink Pink. I would wear pink clothes everyday if I had enough in my wardrobe. I still try to at least incorporate one pink item into my outfit, be it my ring, or my shoes, etc. I also wanted something different this time as far as tattoos themselves go. I didn’t want a black outline. Most tattoos are outlined first, and then filled in with color. I decided to go with a small star with tails of smaller stars on the top of my right foot. Not that I am a SUPA STAH… but… no wait, I am! Hehe. I am to myself, anyway. This one was also meaningful because I drew it on myself. Candie (again), Stacey, and I went to a town nearby to a guy that has a “shop” in his house… Candie works with his girlfriend. Anyway, I drew it, he tattooed it. It was the first time he used his new pink ink, and he did a fabulous job.  So that is the history of my tattoos. I will leave you with some final thoughts (a la Jerry Springer).  1. Make your tattoo mean something. Think about it. Draw it on yourself. Love the whole idea of it before you even decide you are really getting it.  2. Don’t be afraid to make something mean what YOU want it to mean.  3. Get something relatively small for your first tattoo. You never know how you are going to react to the pain, and you don’t want the entire American flag on your back if you can’t handle one star.  4. Get something in a place that can be hidden easily. When I’m at work, you would never guess I have tattoos unless I wear shoes that show my lower ones. There is nothing like a big skull and crossbones on your forearm, or a swastika on your hand that says “I screwed up years ago, but I can’t hide it now!”  5. Tattoos hurt. It is a fact. When people ask me “Did it hurt?” I tell them “YES!” Do not try to be tough and hide the fact that they hurt. As far as how bad… well, any woman who has given birth will probably tell you tattoos are a breeze. Kidney Stones? Tattoos are a breeze. Bladder infection? Tattoos are a breeze. Really, it feels like a burning sensation. You ARE having a needle dragged through your skin, while it is going up and down in a SUPERFAST motion. But I must say, if I can handle FOUR (or Eight, haha) anyone can. I’m a total baby.  6. Never be afraid to defend your choices. There are people who do not like tattoos; some believe they are sinful or ugly. That’s fine. Never back down. My mother always said “What are those things going to look like when you are eighty?” I always reply “Well, they will look just like all the other tattooed 80 year olds in the nursing home.” Tattoos aren’t just for sailors and convicts anymore. They are for everyone, teachers, accountants, dentists, nurses, garbage men, and doctors. Anyone.  7. If you don’t like my tattoos, that’s fine. You can even tell me. That’s ok. I like them. I love them. Even the old junky one Gypsy gave me.  So what about you? Do you have any? Tell me if you think I’m skanky, brave, tacky, or cool. I’m not sure if Haloscan allows people to put pictures on their comments, but I would love to see some of y’all’s!

       So, as of this morning I had lost... 2 pounds !! Hoorah! Keep in mind I have been dieting for 2 days. So if I keep it up, I could be 14 lighter in 2 weeks! Yay! Hey, it could happen.  Paperwork is in progress on the house; things are going good.  Hopefully we will be moved in by the end of this month.  Scout also got a new abode... check it out!

       urlLink    Here it is!  There is gravel in the yard because it was recently a gift shop and this was the parking lot!  We will have it moved and a nice pretty green yard by next summer, I hope!  The wheel chair ramp will also be gone.  Landscaping needs some touchups, but the current owners said they will try to do clean it up a little bit...  as long as they are doing all the painting, I'm not worried about it.&nbsp; urlLink

      Well, I've been wanting to do comments that have a popup box instead of a separate page, so I installed Haloscan. Sadly, I knew that doing that would erase all the previous comments I had gotten. So, because I love you all so much.... do this for me... COMMENT! Please? Even on old posts if you want. Even things you have commented on before.  I just look so unpopular (haha) without all of your input.  Please?  If you love me, you'll do it.   Don't you love me?   Ok, if you LIKE me, you'll do it.   Don't you like me?  See, I'm all sad. My comments are all gone.  Make me happy, por favor?

      Two major things have been going on.   ONE :   We are getting our house!!!  Hooray!  We were able to agree on a price, and now all we have to do is work up the purchase agreement and do all the appraisal and termite stuff and then close.  I am so excited!  The people we are buying it from are doing all of the painting (in my choice of colors), shampooing the carpets, and doing anything that needs doing to pretty much.  Bub and I already went shopping for new furniture because we have a huge greatroom to fill up.  Hooray!   I am going to post pictures as soon as I can.   TWO :   Went to the doctor today to see about getting back on some sort of weight loss pills.  Long story, short: About 3-4 years ago I was really fat, got on Adipex, and lost 30 pounds - down to size 4-6.  Since then, the weight has been slowly creeping back.  Even after lipo last summer, I still continued to gain weight in other places (fat lady arms, helllllo).  So now I am RIGHT back to where I started when I was really fat.  I have made attempts at exercise though; Steph and I have been walking in the mornings abouuuut 1 mile and a half maybe?  I am also going to start walking with my mom and Laurie in the evenings... they walk 3 miles at a time.  So today I walked a total of .... 4+ miles!!!  Maybe close to 5?  Don't know. I also have only eaten a Sonic salad today, and that is only because I bought it last night before I remembered my parents were cooking supper.  I really hope I can stick to it this time.  I don't like feeling crappy about myself.  So that's my progress.  Wish me luck with the house and the not eating.  I'm gonna need it!!!
