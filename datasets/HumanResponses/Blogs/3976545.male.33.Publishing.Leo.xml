      I enjoy the odd video game on the PS2; just a handful, and limited to a small range of interests. The rest of my main circle of friends are all far more into it than I, which is fine, but some things about video games drive me nuts, so I don't dig them as deeply. Anyhow. I do like firing up the PS2 for sports games, mainly soccer(though I prefer Championship Manager on the PC for this now), hockey, and football. A new NFL game, ESPN NFL 2K5, was just released, and at $20, sounds like a steal. Somebody on a DVD Talk thread mentioned that you can use the codes on Coke bottles to get a $10 discount on ESPN games. I think "New football game for $10? Wheee!" Because, you see, I throw back the occasional Coke at work, and discovered that I already had 6 caps from the growing herd of empties and nearly empties sitting under the back of my cubicle.  &nbsp;  The mission then: GET FOUR MORE CAPS. I had already had a Coke that day, and didn't need even more of the beverage. So my next thought was to scavenge my workplace for bottle caps with those precious codes. Which is what I did. Yes, Dear Reader, I spent valuable time (granted, I would have otherwise been working, so there you go) a) digging through a recycle bin for bottles that might have a cap. I scored one that way. Three to go. b) Swiping the bottle of Coke off the desk of a co-worker at a meeting and swapping out their cap with one I'd already gotten the code off of. Two left. c) Checking the recycle bin again. I gain another this way. One precious, precious code to go for my $10 coupon. d) Checking our section's fridge, where I spied a half-finished Coke sitting in the door amidst various and sundry other half-used, probably forgotten items. After checking to see that no-one else was around, I shook the Coke vigorously to make sure it wasn't recently. Seeing little telltale foam, I took off the cap, replaced the Coke in its spot, and exulted in MISSION ACCOMPLISHED. I entered my remaining codes, got my coupon code, and ordered the game online.  &nbsp;  Only later, at home, did I think to doublecheck the order. I had ordered the X-Bollocks version by mistake. After a swift mental kicking, I noted that EB Games allows in store returns for items bought online, so in the end, it will require a little more work, but as is said, nothing worth having ever came easy. Not that I am comparing a silly video game to anything really meaningful, I just need to justify yesterday's cap hunting lunacy somehow. I should mention that there's an ESPN NHL game coming out in early September, and that I only have 2 caps for that one, having scavenged one and come by the other through normal means (ie buying a Coke). The time frame should at least spare me from a repeat of similar behavior. One hopes.  &nbsp;  Currently Listening to: Suede: She's In Fashion EP  &nbsp;  What Am I Reading?

      Upon further consideration, the posts below make no sense whatsoever. We cannot promise improvement in this area.

      We have noted above that despite professing a love of the Royal We, that we only employed it the once, and used "I" twice.  We promise to make every effort to improve upon this in the future.

      After seeing oh so many of my friends and neighbors beginning these things (well okay, two other people), I have decided that the world is perhaps ready for my own brand of egocentric crap for people to read. We'll (I like using the Royal We) see how this goes. I hope to provide a vertiable cornucopia of silliness, seriousness, and related non-sequiturs, as often as I feel up to it.
