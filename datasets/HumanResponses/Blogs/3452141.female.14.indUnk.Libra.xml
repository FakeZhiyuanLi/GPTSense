      Sorry it's been so long since I wrote in my blog, I've been busy.  The past few days have been fun with parties and all.  Lauren and William/Steven, your parties were awesome!!!! Sorry if u invited me to a party and I didn't go....I've been booked. Today I might be going to Lake Johnson if the weather is alright with the family.  I really hope the weather is good! If we do go then anyone who wants to come can! From 1:30-3:30 at Lake Johnson. If we don't do that then we're going to stay at home and play "Tripoli" and other stuff haha fun right? yeah sure.  I just got back from bathing suit shopping and I got 2.  One is for my family beach trip, I don't wanna look skimpy so I got a two piece but it's like a tankini (dealing with lenth) but it's a tube top and a regular bottom. It's really cute I also got a two piece bikini halter top thing.  It's blue with white flower, or white with blue flowers, something like that haha, I don't quite remember.   UGH I just found out we aren't going to Lake Johnson..What a disappointment. The parientals should have looked at the weather BEFORE telling me and the family that we could go AHH I hate that. Oh well, what can u do? Nothing in this case.  I think I'm going to go swimming in the neighborhood pool, hmm. yeah, I really don't have much to talk about so I guess I'm going to go now....If u wanna do something call or IM me   ~lee

      Today was my last day ever of middle school. Last 8 periods ever in a school, last locker I'll ever have, last bells I'll ever hear, last time I'll see those teachers, last time I'll see those friends, last time I'll watch a school football game. Wow, depressing right? I'll tell u what, I am pathetic! haah I cry so much and so easily! I'm crying just writing this! Also...It's not just only that my friends are going to different schools but one of my best friends is moving to Sweden June 9th forever! I'M GOING TO MISS YOU ARON!! I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU! Wow....I didn't think leaving 8th grade would be this hard! I guess it is. ok, I'm going to bed now....I don't want to write anymore ~lee

      Oh my GOD. Today was such a sad day!!!! For all of you who don't know today at Martin we had a "graduation" assembly thing. At first it was just boring with awards and everything but then we had a slide show. It had 3 songs, two of which were "I'm moving on" by rascal Flatts and "I will remember you" by Sarah McLachlan, I don't remember the other but it just added to the sadness.  The slide show was a whole bunch of pictures of us graduations 8th graders from throughout the year. I don't think I've cried that hard in a long time! Just seeing everyone in the pictures was so sad and made me upset that I'm going to Raleigh Charter and not Enloe or Broughton. I miss everyone so much!! Tomorrow is our last day and I wish it wasn't.  I am going to cry so hard tomorrow...If u thought it was bad today, just wait till tomorrow! haha, I'll be ok though, don't worry too much.    Yearbooks are awesome!! They are black, gold, and silver.  The background is black and has a gold and silver drawing of the Ford Mustang symbol. It's sooooo awesome!!!! The baby pictures are adorable.  hehe.  I'm going to miss you all soo much!! *sigh* haha ~lee

      Today was a great day!! We had a "Spring Fling" today for the 8th graders.  It as from 12:00 to 2:00.  We basically just got to walk around and eat and take pictures and stuff. It was awesome! I got a million photos of my friends and if I didn't get a pictures of you don't worry, I'm bringing another camera tomorrow.  Today was just so fun!! It just keeps getting better. I hope I can go to Brittany's game tonight and see my buddy Joey.  I just found out he's single!! Oh watch out! haha. Summer's going to be so much fun!! I'm barely going to be home though. I have a beach retreat, (maybe Busch gardens), Georgia, Beach again, Dance camp, Jersey, New York and some other stuff I can't think about. Golly!!   The dance recital last night was crazy fun.  This chick in my class (Katie) sprained her ankle and I had 5 minutes to learn her part, perfect it and perform it!! I NAILED IT! I was so proud of myself (I don't mean to sound cocky or Braggy)haha. My duet with Dylan was good too.  I messed up once which I was really upset about but it wasn't that bad. I love to dance if u didn't already know that about me.  I'm sooo bored!! I would get on AIM but I'm at my mom's work and they kids are on the only computer that has AIM on it and they are playing a stupid game UGH oh well...What can a girl do?  They'll be off soon....I hope.    random thought.  Grape juice is purple (just like grapes) Orange juice is orange (jus like an orange-obviously) but apple juice is not read...like most apples. Why is that? That's really odd.  I guess I'm going to go do some other stuff on the blog thingy. Love ya ~Lee

      hey everyone. today has been an alright day. not much exciting happened. me, brittany and rachel woke up around 9:30-10:00 then at 11 we started walking down to Kohl's for lunch. It's about 2 miles (as i've said before) and it was tiring at lunch time because the sun is soo hot!! but it was really fun, we had alot of bonding time together which was cool but i think some of the family is mad at us or something because we "seperated ourselves" i dunno i just hope they dont stay mad if they are :-/ oh well. the whole family was going to go baseball or softball, which ever is which. hahah but it started thunderstorming!! ugh, it was horrible! all we wanted to do t odaywas go to the beach and play a fun family game of baseball but nooooo IT RAINED!!!! i'm so mad. we might go and do it tomorrow but i dont know. tomrrow is some(most) of the families last day here *tear tear* i'm upset, i wish we could stay here forever. *sigh* each night we have 4 people in the family who are assigned to making dinner and cleaning up after dinner. tomorrow is my night and i think we're making pizza. well anyway, i have to go cuz my step sister's bugging me about her getting on the computer. but we took a family walk on the beach and we were throwing footballs around and it was sooo fun and today we took a fmaily photo and i have to go ughhhhh alright i'll finish updating tomorrow night!!! ~lee

      hey buddies! today was day 4 at the beach! fun stuff! i got burnt OWW it's killing me, it itches but it hurt and UGH, but the good thing is i'm going to get tan! WOOT WOOT!! hehe, wow i really need to stop saying that.  Tonight everyone is finished playing games, they played that weird poker game again and i just sat and watched.  I slit my big toe and my 2nd toe (on my right foot) 2 days ago by a sea shell and it hurt sooooo bad!! UGH! sand keeps getting in it and I just want to chop them off. And as i said in my last blog my legs are peeling so everytime i come in from the ocean or the pool i put new bandaids on and more baby oil on my legs. hhaha i'm a "walking medicine cabnet" as my aunt betty ann calls me. hehe well today me and brittany went for a late night swim, rae didn't come, *sigh* i hope she starts doing more with us, she's just sorta never in the moood or just...not there, i dont know oh well. well today was fun, me and brittany started taking picutres of ourselves for a "BIBER BEACH BASH" photo album we're going to make. we're also making t-shirts. well we aren't making them but they are going to be made and i'm soooo excited! hehehhe they're going to look so pretty and so is our photo album!! AHH ok well me and braittany and rae sorta met these guys, well we actually haven't quite met them yet, we just sorta stare at them haha. and we dont know their names but there are 2 of them (brothers) they look about 16 and 20 but that's alright. we've named them PB and the other one J.  i dont quite remember why but it's funny cuz when we see then we're liek "PEANUT BUTTER" or "JELLY" and expect them to answer but they just never do which is sorta depressing. haha well our goal for this beach trip is to meet them. ahaha ok well this computer is really messing up and i have to go so i'm out and i'll update tomorrow so you all can be informed of my lovely life haha sleep sweet everyone ~lee

      hey everyone!! Right now i'm at the beach with my family!! i'm sooo excited. (well my step family actually) it's the 1st thing i've done with my step family (other than the wedding) after i was officialy into the family. well are having sooo much fun!! We got here on Saturday at3:00 PM.  My dad, my sister, step sister, step brother and I were all in the same car...talk about croweded!! it was misserable!! well it actually wasn't   that   bad. oh well, i'm just looking forward to the way back...ha ha...yeah..right... ahah wow, that's alot of dots.  Well it is Monday night now and i've just been too busy and too excited to write in here.  Right now the family (Roger-my dad~~Rachel-my sister~~Ben-my cousin~~Betty Ann-my aunt~~Dave-my cousin connie's b/f~~Connie-my cousin~~Jason-my cousin) are playing a wierd type of poker. It's the kind on TV and it just confuses me too much. Me, brittany (my step sister) Michael (my step brother) and Lynn (my step mother) are just watching becuase we're too slow to get it. haha last night, me, brittany, and rachel went down and got Henna Tattoo's at WINGS! (BEST STORE IN THE WORLD!!!!) and so did michael and my dad and lynn but they didn't get tattoo's.  Then we went to KOHL's and got really good ice cream, we saw really hot guys but we didn't go over there and talk to them because we are good a respectible girls. hahaha sure.... lol jp. then after we finished our icecream, me brittany and lynn walked home ( 1 and 3/4 miles) and rachel, michael and my dad rode in the car. we didnt' realize it was that long of a distance till we got home haha.it was really fun though. The night before that me and brittany went on a walk on the beach for like 2 hours or more. it was soo fun!! we just caught up on alot and just talked about everything.  (wow ben just started singing "diamonds are a girls best freind from Moulin Rouge) haha interesting family i have. but anyway, yeah, we walked for a long time and it was soooo cool. brittany is such a cool sister. I LOVE HER! haha well yeah......lets see, tonight we are just sitting and watching our family play poker and now i was bored so i got on the computer and decided to type this to you guys but the IM is messed up and i can tlak to people and they can get it but they can't talk to me, well they can i guess but i can't read it so it sucks. so if ur reading this than call one of our cell phones. I got sunburn and it don't feel to bad, so that's good, it's not that bad. I'M TAN!! i'm so excited! hahaha we're leaving the beach July 3rd and i'm not quite sure why but that's all i know about it. we have to be checked out by 10:00 AM!!! UGH. tomorrow night we are probably going to play some big family game, fun stuff right? haha, my legs are peeling soooooo bad!!! ugh it's annoying! (hally if ur reading this it's almost as bad as ur legs were peeling and you know how much i was hurting UGHHH hahah) and so i have baby oil on them now and i smell like a baby's butt, and i feel as smooth as one...well i've actually never touched a baby's butt but i'm sure if they use baby oil then they feel pretty cool. haha I LOVE THE OCEAN! it is soooo aweosme! me and my little cousin Bailey were talkin anbout being birds and mirmaids! heeh it was so fun. she's so cute, she's 6 years old and has strawberyr blonde hair ( i swear i fit right into this family hehe) and shes freckly and missing one of her front teeth! haha she's adorible.  tomorrow i think we're going to go Kayaking and/or jet skiing. is that how u spell that? or is it skying? i think 2 i's.  This whole family is really competitive and aggressive, but they are awesome. They also sing a whole lot. Today me, brittany, ben and michael were in a raft (well ben was the only one really in the raft) and we were all singing random songs and we were belting out "complicated" by Avril Lavigne. haha it was interesting sense none of us have that much talent, expecially Ben, he lacks in the singing but is good in the sports. and so does everyone in this family, they're always doing something active, it's tiring tryint to keep up with them. wow i've written alot and my arms are killing me.  uhh lets see what else to talk about. hmm i think that might be it. oh well i got back from georgia about alittle more than a week ago.  and i'll tell u all more about that later. it was soooo fun! me and hally ahve sooo many inside jokes and sooo many memeories, i have 2 words for you hal....HE'S 13!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! hahah well the 2nd is a number but it's all good hahahahahah wow, sooooo much fun!! haha ok i'm going to go stare at my family and pretend i know wha ti'm doing, wow, everyone is out now except Rae, Dave and My dad, INTENSE!! my sister is cleanin everyone out! i'm deffinly going to vegas with her!hahah ok jason just brought over some cookies so me and him are gonna chow down on some macadmian nuts WOOT WOOT aight love you all MWAH!! ~lee

It hurt soo bad but at least i got a litte bit of a tan! hehe On Tuesday i went to Scott's "surprise" 14th birthday, he wasn't very surprised. he just sorta stared at us and at Abby who was hiding under a see-through table. (not one of the smartest chicks ever) lol Yesterday (Wednesday) I went to SAS to have a whole day of exercising!! It was actually pretty fun.  Today i'm at SAS again, just to help my dad work. That actually is pretty fun too.  I was going to go to a friends house today but i'm "grounded" or something like that. Atleast i'm going to Georgia with my bestest best friend, Hally, tomorrow. i'm soooooooo excited!!!!!!!!!!!! It's going to be sooo much fun.

      Hey, yesterday actually wasn't so bad after all.  At about 3 my parents told me that we could go to Lake Johnson!! So we played Tripoli!! (a great game!!!!) then we finally got to the lake at abut 5:30ish.  It was sooo much fun!! We went in paddle boats, me, Rae and Brittany were in one and My dad, Lynn, and Michael were in the other one.  I don't remember ever being able to paddle in one of those and it's sooo hard!! My leg muscles are killing me today!! It would've been better if it was really sunny so I could've gotten a tan but it wasn't so maybe I'll just lay outside today, unless millbrook pool is open then I might walk up there and swim...hmmmm. Decisions decisions. haha today I was supposed to be with my mom but instead I'm sitting here at home with my sister, fun fun. Ugh, if I knew I'd just be sitting here with her I would've asked to stay with my family in fuquay.  Ugh, oh well, I'll probably just go back to sleep haha but if I was at the fuquay house then I'd either be at home with just Michael (because I slept in) or at the Library helping pack up books with Brittany and her friend Jocelyn.  I woudlnt be home with Michael though becuase then he'd be with the neighbors and I don't think the neighbors like me :(. I dont know why they dont but they dont really talk to me or if they dont it seems as if they dont care what I'm saying. it's sad.  oh well....what can ya do other than be urself right? right ok well I'm going to go be bored with my sister haha c ya ~lee

      yo. it's been a while. ok so yeah, i saw Josh Groban, i love him soo much then the next day we went to see "42nd street" it was amazing!!!!! it makes me want to do tap even though i hate it!! lol it was soo pretty and shiny!! hehe and then later that night we saw "wicked'' it's MIND BLOWING!!! They are such good actors and actresses and they're great signers!! It's crazy how great of singers they are!! i'm nto gonna give u all details about it incase u see so that makes this part pretty short.  I've been home for a while doing nothing and that's fun!! well on....thursday? i think it was thursday anyway, i went to Emeral Point with my youth group. it was crazy fun!!  I hung out with Amber the whole time and we visited with everyone. we spent time with ALissa and Mikey--(cutest couple ever)-- and ben and cameron and other peole i realy dont nkow and my sister and sarah. over all it was just sooo much fun!! and i rode rides that i never thought i would. i rode the ones without a tube under you!! it was so scary becuase the woman was facing amber and ben telling them the instructions on how not to die when u do this and then she turns around and says "what ever u do, don't do that, it could take ur life--ready go" and i was like "WHAT???? DONT DO WHAT??" and he just kept telling me to go and woudlnt tell me and i was so scared lol i got soo dizzy when i went down i was shaking when i got up haha it was actually pretty fun but creepy. i got a tan from it and that was fun. i went on the lazy river with amber and cameron for like 30 minutes and then me and amber were alone so we went on the lazy river cuz we were tired and just sat there and talked for like 1 1/2 hours...it was so fun! haha we're weird.  Well that's that for that and today me, brittany, Michael, Donovan, Bradley, Will, Ross and 2 guys we didnt know went PAINTBALLING!! i was sooo scared and they all made me.....it was actually pretty fun but really really scary!!  This guy shot me and brittany from 3 feet away!! which if u play paintball u know that it's an illegal move!!  you have to be more that 10 feet away to shoot someone and if u get closer than 10 feet u have to say "surrender" and if the people caught dont say "i give up" then they can shoot them or they could just tag the bunker and those poeple would be out. and since it was me and my step sister's 1st time you'd think they would've just tagged the bunker but nooooo!!!! he didnt even say surrender he just shot us from 3 feet away. we both have these nasty big welts on us!! UGH it hurts sooo bad!!!! but we're going to go next weekend haha...we're dorks. oh well tell me if u wanna go!! we're inviting alot of our freinds that we know wont hurt us so come!!!!! hehe ok i gotta go eat i'll fill u all in later love you all!!  ~lee
