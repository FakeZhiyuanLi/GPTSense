      Famous people are weird aren't they?? Its like they're not real people. I just went to the Craig David concert and the show was good (not as good as Prince mind you but I like Craig David better, and yes I went to that one twice on the weekend.)  The show was good, he was good, the seats were excellent!!..  It was all in all a good night... There was some trash on parade though, the outfits of some of the people were shocking!! Not to mention the ages, there was heaps of young girls and older people too. He reaches all people.. which is cool...  Anyway, what I was trying to say is that I think fame is a weird concept. We waited after the concert to see Craig David come out of the backstage door and after a long wait he eventually did. It was very weird to see him in person, in full view and in a normal setting, walking around, getting into a car.   And it must be weird for him that there were hundreds of people waiting for that..,.... I don't know what I'd be like if there were fans waiting for me to come out of my house every day or to go shopping, even for groceries..   I guess we take stuff like that for granted.. I don't know how he lives but it must be well even though it would be lonely..   And all those fans, wanting to know things about you, everything, to see you and hear you.. theres a bitter irony to it all...  but i guess i'll never know because I am not waiting to be famous, i only know what its like to wait to see somebody famous..   Prince was also a strange thing to see. We could see his face better as he had big screens and it was also surreal.. The show was much more 80s and funky, and the band was great.. Also, Prince ended up being on for 2 and 1/2 hours but Craig David was only on for 1 and 15 I think.. but he has less songs.  At Prince  everyone danced ... at this one, the fans were too reserved and only a percentage of the crowd stood up..   For the Prince concert I went because my boyfriend had a ticket that a friend had bailed on but we still had a good time.. he enjoyed it so much and I liked seeing him having fun, dancing and singing. That was on last friday night, the 24th.  Then the next night the 25th I worked at it and went in after with friends. It was less packed and had less of a party vibe.. so I was definitely glad that i went the first night..   So now am relaxed but had a big day, i'll write more later when I have the time..

      Phew!!!  what a day./.....   Its week 12 at uni this week, so I am trying to organise 12 weeks worth of notes for 3 subjects and do all the reading, questions and learning..  Today wasn't bad considering it is my least favourite day. Something good happened for a change, which was good and has given me renewed confidence in myself.   It started yesterday though, when I got back an assignment I had worked hard on . The mark on the paper was 55. My tutor said she wanted to see me and said that it was one of the best reports she had read, and that it was well written and argued.   I thought to myself, "am i hearing this right?".. and told her I wasn't happy and that I wanted something to happen. I asked her if i could re do the assignment and she said she;d ask ...   so needless to say I was pretty fired up yesterday afternoon. ...  whilst on this fired up trippy thing i wrote email to the lecturer and course coordinator requesting to see him to talk about it..  long story short I went today and got him to read it and it was remarked too.. got 70!!!  I almost fell off my seat!!   The moral of the story is that if you know yourself, then no one can tell you otherwise. I knew I was capable of more than a 55  - I usually get average marks like 70 and in this case I knew it was worth about that...   Hehehe... what a day!   ;P

      Just in case anyone is wondering.. (no one probably reads this anyway but to put my mind at ease)..  I didn't end up going out on the day of my birthday (which I said I was in my last blog before todays bloggs.) Because none of my friends could make it  - I ended up going out with my boyfriend and we saw Lara Croft Tombraider and ate Vietnamese in George st .. it was a nice date, and funny cause earlier on in the day a work friend had presented me with this huge buinch of flowers, the most beautiful, romantic flowers ever, two bunches of light and dark pink tiger striped lilys with green leafy stalks.. (shes a close girlfriend too) and wherever we went that night all the women everywhere would look at the flowers, drool and sigh and then look at my boyfriend as if he was the most lovely guy ever!!! Hehehe it was funny!!!     There was one point in the evening when I had to go to the bathroom after the movie and left boyfriend holding the flowers outside the toilets, and this girl approached him when I was inside, and gushed over the flowers and him!!! Heheh.....   But last night was a nice surprise.. it was about a week since the actual birthday, and last night went to the pub with school friends, as my friends from work couldn't make it..   But they surprised me and turned up and it was great!! They are the best, and the presents they got me are so nice I love them..   So thats how my birthday panned out.. (not that anyone is reading this... ??)

      Argh.. so tired today. Went out for my birthday last night with friends from school and ended up at this break beat dj's set afterward... didn't get home til about 4am and woke up at 9ish...  They asked me what I wanted for my birthday and they got me 2 cds (which i requested) and this make up bag thing too for my pending trip overseas at the end of the year. Its pretty cool - its a surf brand one. But its just not really my style. But it is the thought that counts..  though.   I was supposed to clean my room and study today but as you can imagine i am sleep deprived and lying around falling asleep everywhere..   Its been a busy week..i got a lot done - i got my haircut and my nails done too so i feel pretty special..  also went to gym twice, worked two days and attended all classes, tutorials, and had my final commerce presentation ever... and handed in a 3000pg group report..  yay!!   going to rest now... @_@ i feel like a zombie... >.

      My birthday is coming up (23) and I am feeling very bah humbug about it. I don't really want to be older, I want to stay as I am, because I know that I am unprepared.. Coinciding with my birthday is the return of Uni and I know that it will be busy.   There's so much going on in my life right now that sometimes I feel like i can't breathe...  I went to the John Mayer concert on the weekend and in amongst the crowd (it was a sold out event) it was strange that I experienced the physicality of what emotionally and spiritually I have been feeling for awhile.   I felt cramped in, hot, like my skin couldn't breathe, and just weary overall..   But it was the best concert I have been to to date.... entirely worth it..

      If anyone is wondering, when I say ' there ', I mean that place that you thought you would be in when you were little and wanted to be grown up.  But do you ever get  there ? and what  is it ? Is it finishing high school? finishing Uni? Getting into a relationship?  I'm 23 and I always thought my life would be different to what it is now. I always thought I would have done so much by now, yet sometimes I feel like I've done nothing. I'm not there yet.. when will i get there?  When I was away, in KL, my cous said a funny thing. She was talking about her future (she has youth on her side) and all the things she would have acheived by the time she was 25. A house, a car, a high paying job. I laughed at her, and told her what the world really was like, that I was 23 going on 24 and had no house, a junky car and two lowly paying jobs, and no chance of getting them by the time I hit 25. She looked at me in disbelief as if I was lying to her, and I didn't know what to say. They were so important to her, I guess that was her 'it', her getting 'there' was 'it'.   I know that those things aren't important, maybe if I had them already I would think so, but I would rather not have them and enjoy life as it is for now than wish for something that is far away in the future.  I am dying to get away from this place, and see the world. More than just asia, I'd like to travel to Europe, Africa and America, to see what its like there. here, especially where my parents live, its a suburban existence. I go to the local malls and feel out of place because I don't have a pram with babies in it. Two friends of mine got married last year and that scares me so much. Lots of other people have asked me why, but to me its crystal clear - marriage is cutting yourself off from discovering things in this world, and entering into the 'suburban' part of your life. when you're married there's more than just you, and you sort of disappear into that.  For me, at this stage, I think thats 'it'; not getting caught up in the suburban existence; i'd rather be doing something life changing, for myself, that  I  want. Before that (suburban existence- husband, house and kids) I want to be a traveller and have my own experiences and discoveries, away from everything that is here and that I have always been used to..... and thats  it !!!

      HiHi! Basically, I have to write something because I have been soooo darned lazy these past few months and my friend emailed me to say she'd be checking (how boring, Sorry Charmaine!)  She just told me she wouldn't be back for another 18 months, which I suspected because I think that London might be a little like KL, it sounds really fun and a lot of people that go there spend a longer time there than they thought they would.. my unlce spent 12 yrs there and he was supposed to study only!!  Plus its good money and travel prospects everything being so close and all. So this is essential to our keeping in touch..   The last few months, ok three (? i think) have gone past very quickly. I've been away from Sydney and my life here for 9 weeks and  it felt so  goood ...  I love travelling and seeing new things. Coming back has been a little hard actually, because it means i have to do things and get back 'on the ball'... just litle things, like the pile of mail, were hard to deal with, i open it, look at it, then put it back down.. have become really lazy and non correspondive (i know its not a word but ya know).. but the good news is that things are happening slowly. I have cleaned out my wardrobe and am proud to say I am up to date!! I threw away so much stuff I was ruthless!!  On the return journey I got sick, and got a cold so thats also why i haven't been doing anything, - the cold got pretty bad and i just lay in bed for a couple of days with jet lag and the fluey cold feeling of fuzziness.. then it turned into a bronchial cough, which i still have at times...   But about KL, I love it. Thats where I went and spent my time, with my family (aunties and cousins and uncles..) ..The shopping is awesome, and the food is also great. Its like they are more on par with America in some ways - just the franchise chain stores they have there are really American, like hot dogs, pretzels (we have those here i know) and others (they had this one where you could get a pizza flavoured crepe or banana peanut butter crepe all folded over and it was great! really crispy!)  Also the supermarkets are huge!! and the mallssssssss!!   But the funny thing is my cousins seem to be at that age (puberty  - all between 10-20) where they think they are doing everything right but they are really just being strange and silly! And Jay and I saw straight through them - don't know if its about the down to earthness of Australia or just my family..  Being back is a little tiring, cause I know that its back to the daily grind, wish I could escape and run away!!  Haven't worked much at all, both my workplaces seem to not have any work - its quite at TT and DM has already rostered everything up until March-  so have been trying to fill the 3 days i have off per week this session. By chance, got a  job interview  tomorrow with the firm my cousin is presently working for, so feeling abit nervous about it. Its a law firm so I am not exactly feeling confident.. and uni is finishing soon (6 mths) and then who knows?!... its just for more rounded work experience than customer service is all. Gotta try it...Can only try..   Anyway, thats all for now, sorry its so boring!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Hehehehe catch up more soon...

      Does this count as a hobby?   I have decided, that I am going to become a person who has many hobbies. I've been feeling a little 2-D lately, partly cause a new friend asked me if I had an online journal, and i thought I did but after visiting his mine seems so.. well, 2D. I don't know if I want to show this to him.... his site was pretty good, it had all the interests and recent things that had happened to him.. and it got me thinking, what are my interests? what are my hobbies? I guess I just never thought about it before.  That may sound sad,  but when I asked my brother if he thought I had any hobbies, he flatly replied,  "your hobbies are friends and work".  ahem.  Boring!! There's so much to me than that! Isn't there?  Music, concerts, Books, Games, AND friends and work i guess.  Well i guess going to concerts was a bit of a habit last year, and i'm sure it will be too this year. Last year I saw Groove Armada, John Mayer, Michelle Branch and (not really my choice but circumstancial attendance)  Prince, Shaggy and Craig David.  I guess thats somewhat attached to work though, so does that make it a hobby still??   And i went to tropfest last week, which was excellent!! it was a big thing in the domain where they showed short films and everyone brought picnics with wine, cheese, and other miscellaneous picnic food. It was great, lounging around watching the short films.. great stuff.  So I guess I do have hobbies,  and interests, just don't have a site about it.

      I had a great weekend. Bianca is back from Moree and there are lots of social activities happening! Drinks Friday night, got very trashed and sent out some drunkend sms and took P & D (formerly P & T, who is still a little upset) to meet my friend Peter at his work. I was a little trashed, on the way home ate 3 burgers (thats so gross) and so began a bad spell of late night eating binges. Stayed over in the city, went home the next day and that night went to the John Mayer concert at the Entertainment Centre.. it was the best thing ever! I love John Mayer, and so do alot of other girls and women..   But the lyrics, they are the best.. and I wish I had written down his set so i could remember it better, I was so scared I'd forget about it when I was watching him. We had excellent seats, mine was directly in front of him, first elevation entertainment centre.  Awesome Awesome... i bought the live CD any given thursday, and a sticker for my brother... A friend of mine surprised me with a ticket it was so lovely..  but we went for supper after (bad) and had korean (which was good) but I didn't get home till about 2, then had to get up to work at brookvale the next day.. (tiring)..   I have been floating around with a sea of John Mayer lyrics in my head all day.. and was all weekend..    "If only my life was more like 1983"     Whatever happened to my Whatever happened to my Whatever happened to my lunchbox? When came the day that it got  thrown away and don't you think i should have had some say  in that decision.........    He also talked quite a bit.. i really like him, he has a funny sense of humor and this way about him that is familiar.. He was doing an impersonation of his mother it was so funny.. you can tell that he's really clever and witty... quite taken with that.. want to go to New York to see the city he lives in, if it has the same vibe.. and want to try to explore some  more music.. jazz especially.. *sigh*...

      Wow.. Time has flown, I have done so many things in the past few weeks don't know where to start. Well, I got the job at the law firm, and am there 3 days part time helping them out answering phones and photocopying, filing etc.. mail run in the afternoons after lunch.. its easy work sometimes hectic and the ladies are really nice (its actually an all female office, and one man). They are all Malaysian Chinese which is funny cause I have never worked in that kind of environment, but only had dinner parties family things in that type of environment. Lorraine one of the solicitors brought in curry puffs the other day and they were so nice! And Florence is from HK, she is always going for milk tea and they always buy me one!  But have been really tired the past week cause Ticketek has been pretty busy. Poor Dave I have been no picnic this week.. Last weekend I worked all weekend and this weekend I also worked, the Easter show is on at the moment and its been pretty hectic, I have been supervising lately so its a bit nerve wracking having people actually look to you for advice all the time.   But today I went out with Brian, Deepa, Katie and Carol (Brians flatmates). They are so funny and Carol had never seen the Opera house or Harbour Bridge so I made us go there - she liked it. We had dinner at Darling Harbour and also had yum cha at Chinatown in the morning.. The thing is, they spoke Mandarin alot and it was a litte confusing, I felt so left out and can't imaging how Deepa felt, I actually had to interrupt them and ask them what they were speaking about at dinner tonight. I felt so rude but they shouldn't have been speaking in front of us like that, especially with Deepa there. The fact that she came is quite refreshing, that she is willing to make contact like that and go out of her comfort zone to hang out with me was so endearing. Shes such a sweetheart.   Bee's back from Moree, and its so good to see her again. We went to the Easter show yesterday and it was sooo much fun. Me and Dave and Annie and Bee went on the ferris wheel and Annie was so scared she was clinging to the sides and doing deep breaths with a whhoooaaahh!!! whooaaahh!! and screaming!! hehe she is great fun.. We got our faces painted - I got a butterfly, bee her's painted like a fairy/showgirl and Annie got her's as a cat, pink to match her jumper, complete with black kitten nose with a splotch of glitter. So cool.. Ppl kept looking at us like we were strange but then smiling to themselves.. i think secretly they wanted to also but didn't have the guts..   Going to sleep now, on a last note we saw this alpaca yesterday and it was so dead to the world sleeping that it was sitting down but had its head flat on the floor in the hay, conked out.. it looked so funny.. i wish i had taken a snap.. thats what i feel like doing for the next 9 hours..

      Hehe regarding online journals, I was speaking to my cous online last weerk and we were talking about online posting and journalling.. The reason why I thought my site wasn't up to scratch is - there's layers ... outer and inner.. And this is my inner journal, not an outer.. I should have realised by the glib, trendy-ness of that guys journal (who i secretly think is now a bit of wanker anyways) that it was an outer, or 'public' journal as my cousin put it....  and who has time to make a cool trendy journal for ppl to look at and say, 'hey, cool journal'!??

      *Sigh* Not a good way to start a post i know, but its how I'm feeling right now..  The interview this week (i can't believe it was only this week, feels like forever - its sunday night and it was only 5 days ago) was well, it was a little odd to be honest. The first round was easy, I knew that I was doing well, but this second round, truthfully I don't think I was that impressive.   I arrived at the place a little early and like last time, was surprised to find that there were others there that had been there since the morning.. (another batch of recruits).. why am I always surprised?? I have no idea..   I am so naive like that.. They made us go into this small room, and sit at tables and prepare an individual case study. Mine was about car heaters and the production line, and at first I had no idea what to do. I read it a couple of times to get the info into my head since it was swimming from the excitement.  Then, as soon as it was done, they made us wait before we were taken away to do interviews...   There were three people that interviewed me - Wayne, Barry and a lady whose name I can't remember.  I did my presentation and felt stupid doing it to be honest, since it only went for about 8 mins, we talked about the problem and how to fix it. and then about other things also.   They asked me what my best subject was a uni - wasn't quite prepared, said strategic management. I should have said Business in Europe but i thought strategic mgmt sounded better.  it was still a D  - and worst - chemistry.  andyway, i felt a bit naive, i'm this thing that hasn't been out of uni or had a real job and i'm speaking to these ppl that have worked with the company for almost 20 years, and the lady 7 months. she commuted and said she was getting tired. said alot of ppl did it, which is reassuring.  The rest of my week was a real blur. Wednesday I had lunch with Justin, and it was fine, we have always gotten on well. But then on Thursday I was with Dave and we bumped into Justin and he looked sort of surprised, and he hasn't emailed me since ( I had sent him an email wed night).. he was with a girl, a pretty little girl, and they looked pretty uncomfortable. Which was weird. I am not sure how I feel about it really, I felt a bit down really but thats silly cause he knew new I had a boyfriend (as did I, duh!), it wasn't a secret.... sigh,... i don't know.. all i know is that sometimes there are ppl you've always been drawn to and i just don't want the progression  of our friendship to change now that he's met my boyfriend.. he could have just been really busy and not had time to email.. But i don't know whether or not to contact him or wait till he contacts me.   Thursday night i stayed up til 2 writing my assignment presentation which is tomorrow.   ARGHHH!! My LAST presentation for uni!!! YAY!!  Dave's bday was on Friday and i met him for a drink with his work friends. They are nice, very Australian. Then Dave and I went for dinner at Wagamamas and we got lots of little side dishes.. came home to his place, he fell asleep (cause he had had so many beers), and I went home..   We are getting along a lot better now, we were fighting a lot (or I was) for the last couple of months, somehow he was really annoying me by just being himself.. I am not sure if thats ever happened to anyone else thought assume it has. Although I was feeling a little down this week, I am not sure why. He has been very patient and understanding through it all, even though I was horrible..   I bought him towels and a bathmat for his bathroom. He chose them he's getting quite good at it really. They're really nice, his little apt. is very coordinated and relaxing to be at.. Last night we went out with his parents, they're up from Vic and it was like old times. They sure can drink though.... After we saw them last night I was trying to teach Dave some Canto phrases. He's not bad, but its so weird hearing him say things!! But i like it.   THats all I have to babble on about this week..   Tomorrow starts another cycle.. it never ends.   week 12 at uni only about 3 more till the end.   sigh...    Chaz, if your reading this, hope you're doing well babe.

      Yep, thats right, I'm invited back!! Yahoo!! I have to go back on tuesday, and do a presentation to the line managers. Here's the paragraph from the email:   Congratulations you have been successful in moving through to the second round of the Masterfoods Australia/NZ Graduate Recruitment process, which will be held on the week commencing Monday 10th of May.   We will require three hours of your time, on the day highlighted below.  In the first two hours you will prepare a case study to present to Masterfoods Line Managers, followed by a half hour presentation of this case study.  Finally we will require you for an interview to commence immediately after the conclusion of your presentation.   Its a bit daunting! But so exciting! I'm ready!!   In other news, nothing much else is happening, except that I clumsily sprained my ankle whilst coming home from the station.. I had plannned to go to Bowral to see school friends but that came to an end. Tonight is Allys Bday party, i didn't know what to get her (the girls all went in and got her something already, didn't even ask me) so I just got her this hand cream set with little gloves. I think its so cute but i don't know, if she doesn't like it i guess I'll give her the receipt so she can change it... i am over caring what anyone thinks, if they are getting a present from me, they'd better just like it.   I think i'm good at presents, unlike some ppl (one yr the girls went in and got me a picnic basket - i already had one so now i have two cause i didn't want to rude and say anything)......and last yr i asked for cds and a toiletry bag for my upcoming trip and i got this white make up boxy thing which isn't really what i meant (and now lives underneath my bathroom sink in the cupboard as a general stoage thing), so i am going to have to be specific this year indeed...   Sigh.. Dave's bday is coming up and I have no idea what to get him. He is so hard to buy for! Particularly cause I think i am running out of ideas... He needs alot of things for his apt, like towels and a broom but i think getting those might be boring.  Hahah speaking of boring I asked him if he wanted concert tickets to the John Butler Trio and he said he'd like towels... so I guess towels it is then.. and I might take him for a nice meal... he loves king st wharf, as I do, his work always has these social club (yes he's in the social club) dos and the last one he raved on and on about!!! But i'm glad that he's enjoying his work!  Well, better go do some Uni work.. thats right I still have uni work...   BYE!!

      I got a first round interview with Mars Inc..   Me..   when I got the email I didn't believe it so I printed it out..   When I got to the interview (after a week or two of apprehension) the lady, Narelle, told us that 3900 ppl had applied, and only 510 invited to attend..   So now I am waiting to hear about the second round.. and its killing me softly!!!!!!!!!   ALso, today I met this guy from my class, Jian Du. I have wanted to meet him for awhile but the opp never came up. I wondered about him for awhile now.. Eddy and I were at the Unibar and i saw him and his friend sitting there and waved, then went inside. After about 2 hours, they came over to us to talk and had a drink with us.  I thought he was from Shanghai but he is from Harbin, even further north, near Russia. Thats so cool, I have never met someone from there. He sais it is very cold.. His name is Jian Du. There was also another person I met today, a guy also , and he is from Penang!! His name is Sze Yen. Small world!!   Tonight has been busy even though I haven't done much, i caught up with Bee, Emma and Seri over the phone.   Got Gmail, and it had my name! Its pretty cool. Think I am going for lunch with Justin tomorrow.   Its mother's day this weekend and I am unsure as to what to get my mum..
