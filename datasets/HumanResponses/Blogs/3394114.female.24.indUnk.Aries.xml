						   Put my everclear CD on in the car today on the way home.  It's been so long since I listened to it.  "sparkle and fade" has so many great songs on it, it's hard to decide which I like best.  It's such a great cd for filling up all the space around it and inside you.  Here are the lyrics from one of the songs just to give you an idea (although you really need the music too - quickly run and buy the cd:)  *Sparkle and Fade* by Everclear let's just drive your car we can drive all day let's just get the hell away from here for i am sick again just plain sick to death of the sound of my own voice  we can leave behind another wasted year let's get some cheap red wine and just go flying  we can do the things all the things you wanted to no one cares about us anyway  i think i lost my smile i think you lost yours too we have lost the power to make each other laugh let's just leave this place and go to summerland it's just a name on the map it sounds like heaven to me  we can find a town be just how we want to be no one here really cares about us anyway we can find a place make it what we want to be no one really gives a F*&^ about us anyway  we can live live just how we want to live no one here really cares about us anyway we can be everything we want to be we can get lost in the fall, glimmer, sparkle, and fade  the sparkle and fade fall, glimmer, sparkle and fade fall, glimmer, sparkle and fade  forget about our jobs at the record store forget about all the losers that we know forget about all the memories that keep you down forget about them we can lose them in the sparkle and fade fade...  the sparkle and fade fall, glimmer, sparkle, and fade  ******************************  It's just that perfect "run away from the situation" song

						   I feel it building but I have no way to dam this flow So I hide in the bathroom and let my head hang low Let these bitter tears of misery escape me Then try to hide the evidence of my uncertainty  I go to my car and turn up the music high To try and drown my thoughts so I can try To see, to drive beyond a blur of salt I think survival is a matter of default

						   It is not that I wanted this But it wanted me It chased me I twisted and turned And danced away To lose it But it didn't let go Like a shadow It stayed sewn to my heels  So here I am Carrying it As I would a child Or a victor It is lighter And heavier then I thought I didn't want this But it wanted me Responsibility

						   Breathe in life Let it out again Try to calm your heart From what just began  Perhaps it is only That I was not born you That makes me happy To accept a word like true  To see that there are Things more solid then stone That are untouchable Keeps me from being alone  Stand in water Feet sinking into sand Sun warms my face God surely holds my hand

						   I want to rant and rave But this was too close a save And there are things behind my words you would misunderstand So I keep myself silent and aquiesce to your unspoken demand  But there's bitterness ahead I cannot quell How easily you shed What held us so well A friendship built on words and absurdity Now threatened by your heart's bitter captivity

						   Welcome to my world.  To enter my world you must first take the pledge "I will not use officeworks, they are sucky and evil". Thank you.  Your boycott is appreciated and will be kept in mind when I'm in charge of the world.  Perhaps you even deserve a small explanation.......  I have spent a fair amount of time putting together, the past papers into one document.  My plan: print doublesided at officeworks, then bind them. Simple right?  You go there because it'll be quicker then home right?  Particularly at 9am when there were no other customers.  You fool!!! you're falling into the trap.  Competence is a word unknown to that place!  They opened my document.  They printed out the first page. I looked at it - yes fine go ahead, the other 215 pages (x 2) await you.  (enter new customer).   They start to serve him.  I think "please, press the print button, it's not so hard to do, and then it will have started to print".  10 minutes later.  Print button pressed.  "How long will it take?" 20 minutes.  I go for a walk. I come back.  I look at the printer. That looks like a bloody lot of paper.  I point it out.  She stops it half way through it's fourth copy.  For some reason.  It's just a "mostly double sided" document. I sigh, say it's fine.  I choose binding stuff and am very agreeable.  I say, "what will you do with the extra copy?  Throw it out?"  "yes" she replies.  I say "well then can I have it?"  "i'll have to check with my boss".  I wait for my stuff to be bound.  Unfortunately our "very short attention span" friend has spotted another customer. He has lots of documents, in different files.  she has decided that while I stand there waiting (I have now been here for about 40 - 45 minutes) she will serve the new customer instead of taking the three minutes it takes to bind my document (that would keep the man in the business suit waiting for a whole three minutes, never mind me!).  I wait. I tap.  I stare. I sigh.  I whisper annoyedly to matthew.  The boss-lady asks if anyone needs help. The other girl says "there's the binding".  the boss-lady finds another customer to serve instead.  I sigh LOUDLY.  Eventually, they bound my document.  I think it took them less then three minutes to do the two documents. I have now been there an hour.  "sorry we can only give the third copy to you for half price".  Me: "you'd rather throw something out just to stop someone having something for free?  That's counterproductive.  You could be generating goodwill."  "i'm sorry, it's not my decision" (probably a nice girl, it really isn't her fault, it's her bitchy boss) she says.  I sigh.  No I won't take it.  It's not that I can't find a friend who'd want it, but I only ordered two, and they're trying to make me pay for their trash (I mean, it's of NO use to them).  I'm pissed.  I have sent in a complaint thru the officeworks website.  I'm sure they won't care.  But they're just stupid.  All those trees died for nothing because they're so vindictive, nothing can be free.

						   the term "my phone" was used rather loosely in the last post, and should be interpretted as "karen's phone".

						   "My phone is lost irretrievably lost"  These are the thoughts running through my head after searching my car and my whole house for my phone.  Sitting there being as still as possible while I ring it because then even if it's on silent, surely I'd hear it vibrating.    Earlier that day, I'd vaguely looked for it and rung it a few times, but hadn't believed it was lost.  now I do.  And I'm devastated.  I mean my dad's one thing, but this is my mobile we're talking about here!!  (not really, I actually honestly love my dad a bunch more then my mobile, but I wanted to convey my despair).  Matt is out on the balcony with his mobile.  He rings mine, from far far away (downstairs) he hears the unmistakable tones of the smurfs.  There is hope, there is a dream.  We wander down. There in the garden there is a small green glow, and a bubbly tune, and a much loved phone.  12 missed calls.  2 messages.    it's a miracle. It's been sitting there all day, ringing.  No one has picked it up.  there was a light sprinkling of rain earlier that day too.  My phone is unphased.  I carry it upstairs, berating it "why did you go and hide in the garden, you naughty phone!!".  Seriously. I have no idea how it got there.  My last memory of the phone is monday night matt saying to me "you don't need to bring your phone" and me saying "oh yeah" and putting it on the table.

						   It all started last night.  I was sitting at the table, trying to get the protector on my pda (which is irrelevent to the story except that because I was interrupted, it now has bubbles between it and the screen which means the stylus doesn't run smoothly on the screen anymore).  When my mother called me (with a most serious face) to her bedroom.  Where dad was lying on the bed clutching his chest and saying it hurts. I looked at them and said "why don't you just call an ambulance - that's why you pay the levy" (in fact that's why they pay it about 10 times, because now that the ambulance levy comes with your electricity bill my parents pay it on their home bill and all their business bills - I mean really they should be able to get special sponsorship signs to put up "QAS - we give, because we believe" even though they give because they have no choice because the queensland government has created a practically illegal tax).  Once I convinced them to call the ambulance, I launched into the "heart pain" speal:  me:  How much does it hurt dad: a lot me:  scale of 1-10 Dad: it's up there me:  where is the pain dad: (general hand gesture including his whole chest and abdomen) here me:  (silent groan)  does it radiate anywhere dad: no me:  what's the pain like? dad: it hurts me:  (teeth grinding) is it sharp, burning, crushing, dull etc? dad: it really just hurts a lot me:  have you ever had a pain like this before dad: no  me:  (I suddenly notice he's a bit protective of his stomach - like it'd hurt to touch -     I feel suspicious) - Are you sure it's not burning, up into  your throat, did you eat anything tonight (i'm thinking this is epigastric) dad: no me:  does anything make it better or worse? dad: no, it just hurts (insert siren, then the sound of ambos coming up the stairs) dad: It's going away, I'm starting to feel better me:  so how long has it lasted then? dad: about 30 minutes (i myself have only been there for 10 minutes, and I did have a little feel of his totally fine pulse in that time)  Then the ambos did his BP, three lead ECG, felt his pulse, had a chat.  Said probably epigastric.    My DDx (differential diagnosis): ulcers diverticulitis (last colonoscopy says he has it) pancreas panic attack (told me he thought he was dying, Kj said that about 8 years ago, he thought he was having a heart attack, and it was a panic attack, probably doesn't really account for the pain, but you should always put psychogenic as part of a DDx).  In fact I was actually much relieved when I came into the room and he was having chest pains.  Because I somehow knew, I was being called in as a medical person.  The only health problem I know dad has at the moment - inguinal hernia.  And so I was thinking "this better not be about that, because I'm not looking at it, I just won't!!!" So when it wasn't that, I sighed in relief.

						   This is my favourite song at the moment: *Mad world* All around me are familiar faces  Worn out places  Worn out faces  Bright and early for the daily races  Going no where  Going no where  Their tears are filling up their glasses  No expression  No expression  Hide my head I wanna drown my sorrow  No tomorrow  No tomorrow  And I find I kind of funny  I find it kind of sad  The dreams in which I’m dying are the best I’ve ever had  I find it hard to tell you  I find it hard to take  When people run in circles its a very very  Mad world  Mad world   Children waiting for the day they feel good  Happy birthday  Happy birthday  And I feel the way that every child should  Sit and listen  Sit and listen  Went to school and I was very nervous  No one knew me  No one knew me  Hello teacher tell me what’s my lesson  Look right through me  Look right through me  And I find I kind of funny  I find it kind of sad  The dreams in which I’m dying are the best I’ve ever had  I find it hard to tell you  I find it hard to take  When people run in circles its a very very  Mad world  Mad world  Enlarging your world  Mad world  **************  It's just got one of those perfect melancholy tunes.

						   Well matt and I went to Joseph Alexander's for dinner last night.... yummy, yummy, yummy.  If you live in brisbane I totally recommend it.  It's on corro drive.  The service was excellent. We had entree's first, you can get a medly of entree's for two people and we had: honey quail of some description - on a bed of grilled figs and pears  aniseed duck springroll with a chutney type dipping sauce - delic grilled prawns with a sweet peanut sauce (on the side for matt's sake) battered scollops (which were so soft and tender) and lemon grass and chilli oysters  Everything was good from that selection, I could go back and just eat their entrees!  Then I had confit of duck on a bed of grilled asparagus with mushroom rice.  The duck was cooked perfectly, just pulling away from the bone.  It was also - all good! Matt had a rack of lamb with something-a-rather on the side.  We both then had the chocolate soufle for dessert.  You've never, ever, ever had chocolate soufle this good.  Seriously.  Go there and eat dessert if you can't afford the rest.  It's the best you'll ever have!

						   Today is my one year wedding anniversary:)  It is a good day.  Also my sister got back from being overseas:)  well matt and I managed to organise that we would go out to a nice restaurant for dinner, but this morning we both realised this is one of those times in life when you're supposed to give each other presents.... oops!  Neither of us had bought a present.  Apparently the one year anniversary is the paper one....   oh well.  I don't think the present thing is going to happen.    Squid fishing on the weekend was a dead loss, however I did get to go shopping before hand and buy a whole bunch of cool gear so I'm still pleased.  Now I have a prawning net (I'm looking forward to going prawning and then eating lots of yummy fresh prawns - always the optimist), surf shoe things (non slip soles and the rest is wetsuit material), squid gigs (although we got a few snags and lost one of those fishing), a fishy measuring ruler, some lures, tuna oil (to pour on the squid jig so the squid will like it better).  So after spending $80 on gear, it probably would have been cheaper to go and just buy some calamari (which we ended up having to do anyway....).  Oh well.  This week is state of origin week...  Down with the blues!  It will be most disappointing if we lose this year!  Well I have procrastinated enough, must be off.

						   One of my friends has placed me in exile.  I'm not sure how long I will be in exile, with all attempts at contact by me ignored, but I'm fairly sure my crime didn't warrant this.  lalalalalala.  That's me singing because it's boring in exile.  I'm not sure whether to be pissed off or amused that at 23 we still have to play the "ignoring each other" game.  I'd send you to his blog to read the comment I put on that might have contributed to my exile, only he deleted it, and the post it was in reply to.....  I can only presume I hit my third strike and damn it - I never heard the umpire calling strike 1, strike 2, but I'm hearing the strike 3 you're out pretty loudly at present.  Well better get back to the organising past papers to study...

						   I was going to explain why I've started a blog, and why I called myself earthkissed....  Basically I had a free website that I set up thru UQ, but then they made it so you could only access student websites if you were a UQ account holder...  Seemed pointless.  Being completely inapt at anything slightly technical (Like publishing webpages), I have not been able to successfully recreate my webpage at another address.  So i decided to leave the past behind, and move on to the future: Blogging.  I have a few friends (I think they're my friends, the jury's still out at the moment due to an enduring silence) who have blogs, so I decided to join their ranks.    The earthkissed thing.  I wrote a poem that was sort of about death once, for some reason I took the title of that and made it my identity.... I wish I had like a real reason for doing that, but I don't.  Still as I made it my name, I think I'll put the poem here:  Earth-Kissed  The grass beneath my body cradles me In a fragrant and warm embrace of hope My eyes meet the blues sky and drift with clouds I let my strange thoughts keep my mind afloat  The leaves that are falling capture my dreams Enticing them to the death of the ground Like lead I cannot move, yet I feel light And my deaf ears hear every haunting sound  The wind dances through my hair not my lungs I am covered by a blanket of mist It cools the heat of busy pounding blood I'm relaxed and I know I've been earth-kissed

						   It's a melancholy morning.  I should be at uni.  I'm not.  I'm a fourth year medical student.  Here in Brisbane, that means I'm a final year medical student.  Scary. Next year, they give me a licence to kill. I suspect we're not supposed to call it that.  But considering I'm not at lectures, maybe that's what mine will be.  At present I'm on my neurosurg term.  It's only two weeks, and they don't seem to mind if we don't go.  that means my plan for the day is to organise the past papers into a booklet, and print it to use as my study guide.  Hopefully that won't take the whole day, and I'll be able to just mess around the rest of the day.    maybe I'll go shopping for my squid jig.  I haven't tried squid fishing before, but tomorrow night, I'm going to head down to manly and try my hand at it:)  fun:)

						    My fingers are too small.  I need new ones.  Does anyone have some they don't need?  It's nothing personal against my itty-bitty useless fingers, but they're not quite good enough for the job I need them for.  I'm there today trying to "bag and mask" which requires a one hand hold over the mask and the patients chin, and the other hand for the bag.  So i've got my little finger under the angle of the jaw, my ring finger half way a long the jaw, and my middle finger holding their chin up.  With these three fingers I'm supposed to keep these heavy headed unconscious' peoples head in a good position. My remaining two fingers are over the mask, trying to keep a perfect seal.... but my fingers are tiny and they're stretched as far as they can stretch to bridge all these gaps.  This seems to sap them of strength, so that after a few minutes, the person's chin is sneaking back down towards their chest rather then held aloft, and I can hear the air "farting" between the persons chee k and the mask.  As you can clearly see, I have a good case for new fingers (I mean I thought the skin between the fingers was going to crack and the fingers spread further away from each other in their impossible effort to hold positions that are ridiculous for the small hand).  You may ask why I've bothered to tell you about my small finger dilemma at all...  It's because I'M BORED OUT OF MY BRAIN!  Where is everyone today!!!  Normally I'd just go home, but I've got to meet some person I don't know at lunch, it won't be good if I don't turn up.  Although I have this sudden fear, we said we'd meet at "lunchtime"....  Seems pretty random, doesn't it?  Hopefully I'll locate them....    Well the hunger calls, I must go off on a search of something a little more fulfilling then my mandarin.....

						   You held my life in your hands And measured the weight of it's value And found it lacking But your hands are arbitrary scales And are not fit for judgement What is heavy one day Is light the next Depending on your weakness Depending on your strength  And I am unsure of a fairer measure For surely all our hands are such So who can measure life And say this is worthy This is not Where are the scales Upon which my soul can rest And know its measure is felt In truth, mercy and justice

						    a skeleton ran past me yesterday Like it's bones were on fire It tried to burn away the last flesh Unaware that all that remained was cloth Shorts that dangled like they were hanging from a clothes line A shirt that barely concealed Ribs crumbling from the neglect Of never knowing flesh  And I wondered why it still ran Or even, how it still ran Whether it had enough substance To know about joy and love And then I kept walking  And the workman turned to stare At the skeleton with clothes

						   I have been naughty again.  Here I am in the library when I ought to be in theatre.  I don't know why I didn't go.  It's just a pain I suppose to change into scrubs.  Then wander around looking for the theatre your supposed to be in, then stand against a wall to make sure you're not in anybody's way.  It's all a bit silly.  The worst bit is I'm finding it hard to make myself do any study..... So I'm just surfing the web.  I really should go sit at one of those desks without a computer, grab a textbook, and do some work in my "workbook".  Grr.

						   Well last night, seeing as barely anyone could make it to pizza, matt and I cooked noodles and kate came over to our house.  I had some big chillies that needed to go into the diner, so I cut them up etc.  Normally big chillies aren't that hot (more capsicum like).  Not so this time.  My hands burnt ALL night.  they were absolutely killing me.  I was washing them with soap, soaking them in milk.  Keeping them in an icebath.  I looked quite ridiculous.  But they really, really, really hurt!  We went out to coffee after dinner, and it hurt too much to hold my coffee cup, I had to drink my coffee through a straw!  How stupid is that!  Anyway....  I think it'll be someone elses job to cut up the chillies next time.  I can't explain how much they hurt.  It's hard to believe they're still there.  They're all better this morning, but during the night, my thumb would occasionally wake me up because it was burning.

						   This is a song I hadn't heard for a really long time.&nbsp; But as I was going through my cds putting them all in a database (song by song), I found it again...&nbsp; It just never fails to move me. &nbsp; Just as I am --by Crimson Dive &nbsp; Standing here on the corner I'm looking up in the sky Life is a cloud that quickly drifts by   walking down the sidewalk I'm passing all the people My heart it mirrors the sadness in their eyes   And these questions running round in my head Sometimes I think that they would be better unsaid   Will you still love me, just as I am? Will you still hold me, if I fall down again? Will you forgive me, of all my sin? Will you still love me, just as I am?   Sitting here on the park bench I'm watching the children play Tears on my face are falling, I've lost their innocent ways   Kneeling here on the hillside Looking up in the sky I hear the man, he's crying, why did he have to die?   And these questions running round in my head Sometimes I think that they would be better unsaid   Will you still love me, just as I am? Will you still hold me, if I fall down again? Will you forgive me, of all my sin? Will you still love me, just as I am?   Tears are falling, falling down my face And my arms are outstretched, outstretched in grace And you wonder my child how much I care And I'll tell you that I, I will always be there   You will always love me, just as I am You will always hold me, if I fall down again You will forgive me, of all my sins You will always love me, just as I am

						   I have discovered the new way to study.  It is the best way.  What you will need for this way to study: 1. Bath 2. bubblebath 3. Lots of hot water 4. bath caddy (not necessary, but does assist) 5. Chocolate (once again not necessary, but does assist) 6. a cup of tea (and again not necessary, but does assist) 7. Notes to study, textbook, highlighter, pen.  Now the formula is quite easy.  Put bubble bath in bath, up the end near the tap (make sure plug is in).  Fill bath with hot water that you can just stand to lie in.  sit in bath.  Put your bath caddy across you with your cup of tea and chocolate.  Rest your notes on it too (making sure they don't slip between the cracks and into the water - that was a close call for me!).  Put your highlighter on caddy too.  Have textbook on floor next to bath within reach, with towel for drying hands before touching paper.    This form of study allows you to relax completely as you study, so stress does not interfere with your study:)  It's perfect.  Alas,  you can only study until the water cools down, after that you have to hop out of the bath and quit.  It's a real dilemma, but apart from that small flaw, the whole thing's really quite effective.

I don't know why... caught up in my sea of doing nothing (or at least that's how it feels) in medicine, I let this disease of apathy spread to my blog.  Floating, floating, oh no - three months passed me by and I never noticed.  Do you know what that means?  I am actually living a shorter life then someone I live longer then, who notices every moment....  Oh well.....  better run, got to go and find out what this "assessment" business at the end of hte week is about
