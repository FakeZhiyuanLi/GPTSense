      ok so thanks to my buddy anky who sent me a link on a FREE sneak preview of Riddick I got to see it last night before all of you (unless you had the same nice link sent to you :)    urlLink The Chronicles of Riddick  is a sequel to the movie  urlLink Pitch Black , however it takes place five years later, and the characters of Riddick (Vin Diesel), the Imam, and "Jack" return, however the plot has nothing to do with Pitch Black, so don't worry you won't be lost if you go see Riddick. The writer/director, David Twohy, had an endless budget with this movie and it shows in the effects, costumes and scenery...visually its stunning, and at times you almost want to say "wow" out loud...  Basic plot is that Riddick is a Furian outlaw and on the run from bounty hunters and the evil Lord Marshal and his Necromongers who are out to destroy the universe so they can reach the "underverse." If you don't convert to their ways they kill you. Thandie Newton (of ER fame, Carter's fiance) also stars as a hot, evil Necromonger who is power hungry. Anyways, the plot is simple, Riddick is the only man that can save the planets and races from the evil Necros, but is this outlaw willing to help?   I think the simplicity of the plot has been critiqued extensively by real "critics" claiming that the myth behind plot isn't as strong as it should be and that the storyline is too simple? In this case I think it works, the story flows fast, is high-paced, fun and at times funny. My favorite scenes take place on "crematoria," the prison planet, that is reminiscent of Pitch Black. On this planet Riddick is on the run from the rising sun that is 700degrees and in Pitch Black they were running from the dark, it's definitely a FUN scene and newcomer Alexa Davalos is pretty and can kick ass harder than Jennifer Garner any day! Judi Dench (oscar winner for shakespeare in love) is also in the movie as a higher being, Elemental, and very graceful and british in that role as well.   Overall, its a FUN movie, its visually gratifying (Vin's muscles and all the effects), and the end is a surprise! Can't wait till the next one!   Rating: 7/10   WHAT DID YOU THINK????

      I think its so sad that Ronald Reagan died when he had alzheimer's, but at least he won;t be in the dark anymore...also it's amazing that people are showing such great outpouring and support of him. he was President when we all were like 3? isnt that crazy? well catarina, you are the only one in D.C. now, whats it like?    urlLink Kerry  is beating Bush in the polls ( 51% )  Are you  urlLink registered to vote ?   I think I am the only democrat in Houston. so weird that I live in Bush country.

      a certain someone named jimmy banks promised me certain reviews. here's the space, can u deliver?   Jimmy Banks said on June 21, 2004   (note copied from deleted comments...)   ouch rinku, can't a man be busy? even too busy for ralph macchio?   in my first review i'll shall travel back in time to that magical year of 2002. it was summer, the sun was shining, and hollywood decided to give me a little gift in the form of XXX.  XXX isn't your average action movie...sure it has the trademark terrible actor (vin diesel in this decade, after arnold held down the previous two), but to me it will always be something more, something that gives it a special place in my heart. that's right ladies and gentlemen, XXX was the first movie that ever made me cry.   the story was one that america was begging for: an extreme sports superstar named Xander Cage (what particular extreme sport we shall never know because vin diesel is so damn versatile that he covered motorcross, snowboarding, jumping out of moving cars, etc.) is about to be sent to prison for life, but then he gets a break in the form of NSA agent Gibbons (played by Samuel L. "I'll do anything for a check" Jackson). The deal? oh, only to take down a terrorist regime named Anarchy 99. why it's a cakewalk for a man who can steal a corvette, deliver a rant about a senator trying to rid the country of video games, and still find time to deliver the eloquent line of "moral is: don't be a dick Dick". with that silver tongue i'm sure mr. diesel will not only take over for arnold in the action hero realm, but perhaps in political office.  i don't want to give away too much of the plot, because there is little to begin with, but you know what happens: action hero finds a girl, falls for her, saves the day and goes on to star in the forgettable (and not nearly as entertaining) 'A Man Apart'. this movie is a must watch if you go in knowing not to take it seriously. there are instant replays. that's right, in the middle of the movie you will see shots from different angles. why? because vin diesel is so talented that they had to let you know he had no tricks up his sleave. he made those stunts look that real.   now the big question...why did i cry? maybe i was overwhelmed by another samuel l. performance, maybe it was the cameos by skateboard legend tony hawk and rapper eve (aka 'the pitbull in a skirt'), but i think it might have a little to do with the irony of vin delivering a line about an actor's performance being terrible. you see, he's so good that he even teaches us about the pot calling the kettle black. thank you vin, thank you for the laughter, for the tears, and for the life lessons that you teach us.  Monday, June 21, 2004        urlLink    ciao and have a good weekend.

      First of all, I'd like everyone to Congratulate me as I am an aunt the 2nd time over! Woohoo! My neice   Nina   was born on Saturday, weighing in at 6 lbs. and 19 inches tall! I'm so excited and can't wait to see her soon!  I believe Mrs. Courtney Cox-Arquette also had a baby girl on Saturday so Congrats to her too! (hope her name isn't Apple!) so many girls being born these days!  And the countdowns have stopped,  urlLink Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen are of legal age  as of Sunday...and they have another $300 million in their bank accounts!   This weekend was fun, I hung out with my friend that was in from out of town, showed him around H-town, had some good Tex-mex and relaxed...   Movie review: The House of Sand and Fog   All I can say is that its amazing and has some of the best acting I have ever seen!  and its a tear-jerker, so you must be prepared to be sad at least for 24hrs after seeing the movie... 10 out of 10. (it's now on Video)   Books  I am done reading my 3rd Dan Brown book and though they are fun, I am done, as its the same story over and over again, and after the second book the plots become predictable! Any new book suggestions?

      Hi. It's asif. I'm filling in for rinku today. Apparently, she has a job where people work. unlike mine, where a typical day consists of a ben 'n' jerry's ice cream party. I had the NY Super Fudge Chunk.   anyway,  urlLink some guy won  half a million at Jeopardy the other day.. I was thinking about what I would do if I won $512,000... but that's not enough to actually do anything crazy. so then I decided to think about what I would do if I won 51.2 million dollars. That's a lot more fun. So first I would pay off all my friends' school loans. college, med school, biz school, law school, 7th grade catholic school.. all of it... then I think I need to buy a cool townhouse in Beacon Hill, or a penthouse on Riverside Blvd in Manhattan, or a brownstone in Georgetown. or all three. cuz I have like 50 million bucks. I can do crazy things like that.    Also, on a somewhat more crazy liberal bend, The Boeing Company is again on the verge of trying to hold all us little taxpayers hostage, by threatening to shut down the 767 Production line in order to get the Pentagon to rush the re approval of the  767-based tanker . As boring as this sounds, its actually a contract worth as much as 23 Billion Dollars for a 100 airplanes that no one is really sure are needed. (The ones the USAF own already are old, but they aren't obsolete. Just older.)  urlLink Its the Military Industrial Complex run amok . (Complete with Government Procurement Officers negotiating jobs with their vendors, and other fun stuff like that.)  It's fun when Asif goes off on tangents.

       I just realized that there are only 4 months and a couple days left until, WE THE PEOPLE, can change this country for the better. ELECTION DAY IS NOVEMBER 2.  urlLink ARE YOU REGISTERED TO VOTE?   I know some of you think that your vote doesn't count, and that voting in another billionaire politician that knows nothing about the 'common' man won't make a big difference, and it may not, but exercise your right to choose. I know I sound idealistic and a bit like a commercial but really, I can't stand to see this country wasting young lives in the middle-east anymore. We need to stop poverty HERE and expand education before we go butting our noses into other people's problems. YES, we need to defend our country from terrorists and we need to stop them, but Mr. Bush can't prove the Iraq Al-Qaida connection, nor have we found weapons of mass destruction there. And what about the Patriot Act? Do we need our rights stripped from us more than they already have been? Ok I'm going to stop this rant now, but don't just sit there and remember, my opinion is mine, read up and form YOUR OWN opinions, and DO something about it. You only have 4 months left before we elect the person that's going to lead this country for the NEXT 4 years!     urlLink www.johnkerry.com

      afternoon ladies, and gents...   urlLink File Sharers Beware  ---> more fines handed out !   Oh I can't believe I left out this great story about our fellow scooby gang member (I know I live a deluded lifestyle)Keanu Reeves. Apparently the K-man was in a grocery store in LA when all these bullets came flying through the window(gang related?), he urged everyone to "Get Down" and then helped everyone out when it was safe. This guy is soo cool, my hero. Read the article  urlLink here   MOVIE REVIEW:  IGBY GOES DOWN     Get your dirty mind out of the gutter, its not what you think! Released in Sept. 2002, and now available to rent or buy, Igby Goes Down is a comedy/drama about a 16 year old boy named Igby, played by  urlLink Kieran Culkin , a prep school delinquent who is searching for meaning in his life. Igby, the son of wealthy New York socialite and a schizophrenic father, played by Susan Sarandon and Bill Pullman, is constantly getting kicked out of Prep school and running away from his family. The movie chronicles his desperate and comical attempts to live his life without the help of his wealthy and hypocritical family. With random sexual trysts and drug experieneces along the way Igby has to hit the bottom before he can escape his delinquency and not end up like his crazy father. I enjoyed this movie because its funny, real, and the character redeems himseld in the end without the plot turning to preachy or idealistic. Culkin's acting in this movie is great and makes me wonder why he hasn't been around more? Also stars, Ryan Phillipe, Jeff Goldblum, and Claire Danes. RENT IT!

      yeah spiderman in a lungi! hahah I almost died laughing.   Read the Gotham Comics Press Release  urlLink Here :  "Spider-Man India interweaves the local customs, culture and mystery of modern India, with an eye to making Spider-Man’s mythology more relevant to this particular audience. Readers of this series will not see the familiar Peter Parker of Queens under the classic Spider-Man mask, but rather a new hero – a young, Indian boy named Pavitr Prabhakar. As Spider-Man, Pavitr leaps around rickshaws and scooters in Indian streets, while swinging from monuments such as the Gateway of India and the Taj Mahal."  I still think its really funny.

      it is depressing that someone that once had so much drive and 'joi de vive' is now turned into a " trashy, drinking out of the bottle, marrying dumb men " kind of girl.  urlLink TheSun  has pics of Brit Brit out in the middle of the day drinking whiskey and hopping from fast food place to fast food place with her new fiance kevin.   also i was wondering out loud why I hadnt seen any Kerry/Edwards commercials here on TV yet, and people at work reminded me that I live Bush country, and that there is no chance that John Kerry will "win" this state and hence he probably isnt wasting money on advertising here as much as else where. I mean it makes sense, but its just upsetting to think that millions of bush lovers here in texas will drown out my vote. Why can't we just adapt the popular vote system?   anyways maybe if I can get enough people to just take a look at Kerrys platform here he might stand a chance?  urlLink www.johnkerry.com

      most of you probably don't know but mr reeves is an excellent bass player and played for years with the band dogstar. unfortunately they broke up, BUT there's a new band in LA that keanu has joined, "BECKY." this rock band, albeit pretty unknown, is pretty good. I listened to some mp3s today and they were pretty fun and catchy...the lead vocals are by Rebecca Lord, of Real World Seattle fame, and she has a great voice with a vast range....check out the free mp3s at  urlLink http://beckyband.com/multimedia.php  I like "Higher Ground" and "Evangeline" if you listen really hard you can hear the awesome bass skills of mr. reeves :) i hope they come to texas soon!
