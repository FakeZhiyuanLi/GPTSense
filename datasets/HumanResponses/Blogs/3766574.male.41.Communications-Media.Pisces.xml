      So now it’s, “Mr. Man you could have prevented the trade towers disaster in 2001. It’s your fault,” or so say the public and the media.   The dreaded Aug. 6, 2001 memo, which if Bush acted on, would have saved the world right? Yeah Okay, who needs pinching?  Something tells me administration procrastination didn’t bring down the towers, but don’t get me wrong, I’m no Bush fan. But I’m also no fan of misappropriating blame either.    No, my friends, this group from the desert doesn’t like Americans. We’ve been their target for years, and it’s our fault, plain and simple, not our governments. It’s the way we live our lives.   I guess it’s what we all want to hear, whether its true or not, that our president was negligent in responding to what I guess some would consider, depending on what side of the street they’re standing, “clear and present danger.”    “The truth is out there,” proclaims the motto from the famed Fox series, “The X-files”   So tell me, what would you have had done with this “historical” rather blanket of a warning that terrorists were “planning attacks with explosives” and that they were conducting “recent surveillance of federal buildings in New York.” Shake down everyone in the city? Do a door to door maybe? What would citizens be whining about then - invasion of privacy…and how many other multi-amendment violations?   Sound familiar? - Patriot Act stuff, right?   Terrorists are in the U.S. and they come in all shapes, colors and sizes. They walk among us relishing in our downfall and orchestrating our murder. Our own got us in Oklahoma City in ’95.   They’re all not just box-cutter toting, dark-skinned dudes donning turbans with scraggly facial hair, or stealthy James Bond bimbo types planning some romantic demise of democracy.   That’s what they’re attacking isn’t – democracy, capitalist values, our love of money, our almost complete disregard for Mother Nature, and our declining concern for one another’s welfare. Is the fog beginning to clear now?   We are the capitalist machine – the world of want, Marx sealed our fate with his Manifesto, or maybe you didn’t read that.   Let’s play out a scene. You’re the president and you’ve just received the Aug. 6th memorandum. You assemble your advisors asking each of them to bring a copy of the Constitution.  Call all the airports, essentially what you have to tell them is what exactly what they should have been doing since the grand exploitation of commercial flight, taking adequate security measures to protect their passengers. Multi-billion dollar airlines bailed out of bankruptcy regularly with taxpayer dollars, with little to no argument from us, because heaven forbid we shouldn’t fly, or have to wait too long to get up in air. No, blame it on the government and the FTA.   After the airports, we’ll sure-up the federal buildings, make certain we have added security. Security we should have had all these years, especially since the world trade bombings in ’93 but certainly before Nicols and McViegh in ‘95.   Security concerns outsourced to private companies posting guards who smile and wave daily, who you bestow gifts upon during the holidays and who ask you “how’s the wife and kids,” but for lack of manpower and sufficient training are relatively powerless in times of eminent danger and its resulting disaster. Often reaction is post mortem, not pre-emptive, because to be searched daily or questioned regularly at designated times and checkpoints in the name of national security would piss you off to holy high hell.   Our government didn’t bring down the World Trade Towers, Our own negligence, complacency, and lack of vigilance did.   But were always looking for a scapegoat, aren’t we? It’s good ole American philosophy.  “It’s not my fault. Not me. It’s hers; it’s his; it’s theirs; the devil made me do it,” so goes the rant.  For almost everything you can possibly blame someone else for, Americans will blame besides themselves. Can we accept accountability for anything anymore?   “What about the homeless, and impoverished? We need more social programs Mr. Man,” cries the liberal. Social challenges ignored because of our inability to better share the food supply and more equally distribute wealth. Instead, we opt for government regulation of tax money to which we all have our own spin.    “My kids are stupid! They’re being shot at! What’s going on in our public schools? Mr. Man, we need more dollars for education and protection. More regulations!” scream frustrated parents as they point their finger at a school system they claim inadequate because their child can’t pass the FCAT or for some “unforeseen reason” brought a gun to school. Guardians with their guard down.  Traffic - no one can believe how bad it has gotten. It’s at a stand still two times daily, mystifying commuters on how or when the problem will be solved, not looking around to see most cars occupied by one person – two tons of metal each moving two hundred pounds of flesh.  “Mr. Man, we need wider roads, more highways,” say irreverent commuters who pass by 1-800-CARPOOL signs regularly, but who fail to pick up the phone and who, myself included, all too frequently get pissed off at someone passing in the HOV lane lucky enough to be carrying a passenger.   By now you should have gotten my point. And if you haven’t, it’s possible you’re incapable without a chart, graph, social survey, media quote by an expert, or a politician with his hand up your ass working your head. And even then you still won’t get it until it’s your house burning or your child kidnapped. That’s the reason for this whole mess. American’s aren’t looking out for each other anymore. We’re becoming a nation of isolationists, segregationists and a bunch of Idontgiveashitonists.  And if the war angers us so, where’s the demonstration? …Can’t leave your day job?     - Jay Mitchell  jaymuse@bellsouth.net
