      ALa71's point in a previous post that she doesn't go to private parties with famous musicians anymore sounded a chord -- no pun intended.  Here's my short list of what you lose and gain from motherhood:  LOST FOREVER  1. Sleeping in/sleeping through without a little elbow and toes wedged into your person at some point during whatever night strikes baby's fancy.  2. Carefree nights on the town (you can go out at night, but you never stop thinking about how Precious is faring with the longsuffering babysitter).  3. Ability to worry/think about nothing at all (I've never had this ability, but truly -- my life  was  easier before P.)  4. Laissez faire attitude regarding life-- your child  is  your life, you would throw yourself under a bus to keep them from getting a hangnail and plan to make life very nasty indeed for anyone who looked at them funny, and that is that, without thought or question, for the rest of your life.  5. Unbridled romantic encounters in exotic venues.  6. Ability to go to the bathroom/bathe with either (a) the door closed or (b) if you do manage to close and lock it before the child figures out where you are, ability to use facilities without hearing hot breath and rustling on the other side of the door.  7. Ability to lie on the couch with a cold cloth on your head without the cloth being removed within fifteen seconds and turned into a sponge spa for plastic dinosaurs.  8. Ability to get sick and well with proper convalescence, paying careful attention to your own needs and energy levels to ensure optimum healing.  9. Ability to take a road trip without taking a pain reliever first.  10. Ability to "pick up and go."  11. Ability to go, period.  12. A significant number of brain cells.  13. Your pre-baby body.  14. Your pre-baby skin.  15. Your pre-baby brain.  16. Your pre-baby boobs.  17. Ability to eat a meal/read a book/complete a phone call/open the mail/load the dishwasher/cut your toenails/have an adult conversation/ wipe your butt without interruption.  GAINED FORTHWITH  1. The ability to laugh from your gut when you thought you'd forgotten how.  2. A sense of wonder and awe.  3. The right to purchase and play with cool toys.  4. The right to tramp through museums you haven't visited since third grade.  5. The right to sit up all night next to a miserable, puking wretch who's swatting you away and crying, while watching  Futarama  reruns and bargaining with God for your own soul if only He'd make the 104.5 fever go down.  6. The right to talk to your spouse about nothing else but your child and money.  7. The awe of knowing you grew, birthed, fed and raised someone with only the measly equipment you were given.  8. The right to go nowhere without taking enough snacks and contingency equipment to outfit the 3rd battalion.  9. A little voice saying, "I love you so much!'  10. A little voice saying, "I don't love you anymore!"  11. A little voice saying, "I want that!" about everything she sees on TV.  12. A little voice saying, "What you doing?" every minute of every day.  13. A thousand drawings of dragons from preschool.  14. A brilliant little person, either a mini me of yourself (P) or nothing like you . . . to kick your ass into understanding life like nothing else you'll ever know.  15.  A long, quiet night with a sleeping child in your arms.  16. A rocking chair and a soft song to bring sleep in the way only you know how.

      The humidity in Philly is deadly this time of year, and even at 8 this morning I felt it starting to kick up. I was out watering the Rowhouse's sun-fried container garden as I contemplated the measure of my existence, and plans for a one-way trip to Antarctica came to mind. (BTW, my brother-in-law has been there for research purposes. Twice.)  I had tentative plans with ALa71, and the morning spun out in its usual Saturdayness -- checking email, writing the blog, unloading and loading the dishwasher, etc. etc.  Around noon P and S went to the petstore and I went off erranding alone. I took S's car, which we drove off the lot new in 1993 and which is now a piece of -- well, it runs. So I'm grateful.  But it doesn't have airconditioning, and the designer took the cab design from that iconic vehicle, the Pacer, so the interior was as hot as Satan's buffet after the flambe course. I gamely rolled down the windows ("soldiers in Iraq have to sit in hotter than this with gear on") and promptly began to succumb to heat exhaustion.  I went to the bank, to the mailing store to mail a care package to my AdoptAPlatoon soldier, and to the natural food store to spend $47.90 on soy yogurt and ice cream and various hypoallergenic cake mixes and pretzels. It is amazing the number of ways you can part a fool from her money, but I didn't ask that my kid not be able to eat wheat, milk, egg, peanuts, or tree nuts.  I drove home and got that stuff away, the phone rang and ALa71 invited me to the bookstore. She lives about a twenty-minute ride away, and halfway through I started to get fuzzy and grouchy. I could literally feel my sweat evaporating as it appeared. My dad called just as I was about to turn onto the 12-lane-highway that has two of the worst intersections in the country located about a mile from where I was. (Luckily I was only on the road for about a block before my turn.)  "Justrosie! What was the name of that book you told me about again?"  "Wait a sec, dad, I'm turning onto the boulevard."  He waited while the traffic amassed and I got myself where I needed to go. But by this point my stamina was wearing very, very thin.  How does S drive this thing into town every day?  I wondered.  After switching to ALa71's airconditioned jeep, we stopped for something to eat because by this time I was about to succumb, and we had a delightful conversation about blogging over creamed chipped beef. (Connoisseur rating: 5 of 10, with an extra point for darkness of toast and crispness of homefries).  We went to the bookstore where I spent money I didn't have, and to Old Navy where I spent a tiny bit more money I didn't have, mostly on P.  We parted, complaining about the lame state of the frappuccinos we were drinking, and I drove home again, with a big hot wind twirling through the windows this time, and men in trucks scowling at me when I let them go in front of me because I should have known I didn't have a stopsign and should have gone before them at the intersection! God, I loathe people sometimes -- Philly drivers in particular.  There's not a car on the road, I'm being nice to you, and still you have to trumpet your big macho roadworthiness in front of me, then stop short a block later without a turn signal and make an impossible left.  :::strings together road rage curses::::  I got home and S also in bad mood. Still sulky over fight we had about John Kerry vs. George Bush this morning. He is voting for Kerry; I am voting for Bush, and a herd of donkeys (intentional animal) could not sway either of us the other way. P lovely as usual, but toys everywhere. Played with webcam for a while with P and got her fed and to bed. Now wishing I weren't exhausted, because every second of my  me  time shouldn't be spent sleeping.  I wish I were on a balcony at a seafront villa watching the waves roll in.

      We watched "I Love the 80's" (the TV seems to be broken on VH1) last night -- 1982. And they featured Dungeons and Dragons which S has played since, well, 1982.  The commentators (my favorite is Michael Ian Black, seconded by Hal Sparks and thirded by Mo Rocca) mocked the geeks in their oversized glasses, with curly-hair combdowns that made them look like the Three Stooges' Larry, sitting around tables with little lead wizards holding blue crystals and throwing dice . . .  Ah, yes. It is all so familiar to me.  "We weren't  that  bad!" S insisted. (He still plays with the same core group of geeks -- online -- on Saturday nights. He is the dungeon master).  The show said, "These guys were so smart, they rule the world now . . ."  Frankly I have never been marginalized in a smarter room of people, poring over pen-and-ink pictures of ugly demons and various statistics while I waited for my boyfriend to be  done  so we could go on a date.  "They wore black heavy metal t-shirts to school . . ."  I've mentioned S's t-shirt drawer before, haven't I?  "They'd play for days on end in someone's basement . . ."  The chairs in the D&D room (moved from basement to 2nd floor in 1983 to accomodate the new "Commodore" computer downstairs) had individualized butt prints for the various enactors.  "I'm not sure what they really  did  . . ."  I'm not either. I always thought of it as Barbies, without the dolls, or else Choose Your Own Adventure, without the book but  with  math.  I was the Yoko Ono bitch of this little group. S, not having dated because he was, after all, the Dungeon Master and the games were at his house, shocked everyone when he brought little ol' me home one Friday to meet the gang. They took one look at my moussed hair, my crushed-satin slit skirt and high heels and exchanged strangely asexual, pointed looks amongst themselves.  " She  won't last long," one of them murmured.  Ah, but I did! Longer than your little hobbit game, you third-level paladins! Bwahahahahahaha! :::poof::::  Wait.  He still plays every week.  Who will win?  Who  will win the Ultimate Battle?  One thing I did notice is that one of the die-hard players in 1982 seemed to be wearing the same velour shirt I forced S to part with in 1986. But I'm sure if I looked hard enough, I could still find it. These things are persistent that way.

      Do you remember how great Saturdays were when you were little?  God, I loved them. And why? Because I would get up at 5:30 -- the only children's program on at that time was a Spanish language variety show called  Sonrisas  -- and make myself a bowl of Cap'n Crunch so formidably gigantic that the roof of my mouth would be ripped up entirely until the following Saturday, when I would begin the process again.  Saturdays aren't that great anymore. S is home -- I wait all week for him to have a day off -- yet I find managing the different priorities of having to do something "real" because it's the weekend, stresses me. I want to go out alone with ALa71 and drink Starbucks vanilla bean frappuccinos and make fun of people under our breath. And I often do.  Sweet escape!   Of course, then, someone else's kids are acting up and ruining everyone's peace. .. giving you sweet memories of home . . .  not  . . .  I also feel pressure on weekends to give P some kind of a play date or Cherished Childhood Experience. (Reviewing our own childhoods, ALa71 and I decided that this was a rare occasion for us . . . our moms basically let us out the front door in the mornings, called us in for meals, and made us come back in when it got dark. We never wore shoes -- our feet were solid black from June through September! Alas, the world is not like that anymore.)  But Working Parents want Cherished Childhood Experiences for their kids, too, so every child-friendly venue is packed to the gills at weekends . . . which is why we usually visit those places on weekdays, but then the damn school groups are there . . . .(" Britney! Britney! Sit next to me on this caterpillar! No, not  you , Damien . . .)   On weekends, S wants to sit at his computer all day and complains when he can't, because P is on him like white on rice. There are more dishes to do. The laundry piles up. We tend to make dental appointments for Saturday mornings because there's no way to manage a four-year-old when you're prone in chair with a stranger's fingers in your mouth. Sometimes I have church liturgy (though not this weekend, thank God, because I have to get up  really  early for that).  And if you're away -- well, if you chance to vacation -- I need only send a plea to the mothers in my reading audience to seal the assertion that vacation is vacation for everyone  except  mama, who is juggling sunscreen, sippie cups, "my favorite blankie and my new monkey Baby Junior!  Where is he?!"  :::wailing::: who, when she finally gets to sit down in the hotel and crack the cover of a magazine, because Precious is finally busy with the seventy-five dollars worth of stuff you bought for her on the boardwalk, has her beloved come out of the bathroom in his towel, saying, "Did you bring Q-Tips . . . ?"  It doesn't all add up to the ultimate in leisure time.  So I find myself thinking back to ultimate Saturdays of my distant youth, of which there were many.  I met a boy on the bus in 10th grade. It was the early eighties, so the fact that he wore dark-denim pin-striped tapered jeans was an asset rather than a liability. He had dark hair, blue eyes, a nice smile, and he liked me. He had another girlfriend -- that was kind of a drag -- but those types of things are fraught with high drama anyway, so she was out of the picture in time for a beautiful October day, when he came over my house and kissed me on the tweed couch. Right before we went to the movies -- to see  Terror in the Aisles.    That  was a good Saturday.  I wonder what happened to him? As it turned out, he got his other girlfriend pregnant (now! now! all I ever did was kiss him on the couch), and he has a kid now who is in his teens.  God! Now I feel  old.

      A Rowhouse is a tropical spot to be in a Philadelphia summer.  And the bathroom is the most tropical of all.  Though there are three window unit air conditioners in the Rowhouse, which run intermittently at the cost of $ toomuch  per month, none of that cool perfection ever reaches the bathroom, which is on an inside wall with a skylight for ventilation.  Humidity is an art form in Philadelphia. It makes the world look like a Dali painting, with its gummy stopwatches and leaping tigers. And you feel like a  person  in a Dali painting, inside yourself. For my own part, the weather ratchets my frustration quotient up and virtually erases my ability to deal. With anything. Except sitting around staring into space, which is why I spend a lot of time on the computer in the summer.  The only thing you can really do is stay inside -- or go out and snap at everybody you encounter.  Which brings us to the bathroom.  I can barely deal with my own bodily functions in the summer, much less mildew, but it is then, dear friends, that it sets to with a vengeance.  Cleaning the bathroom is yet another chore that falls to me, though I won't do the gender-bitching about it, because I really don't mind doing it. About once a week I give it a full fumigation, though maintenance takes place on a daily basis (rather like the bathrooms on the turnpike.)  I spray, and wipe, and brush, and scrub, and scowl, and mop, and empty, and towel-dry -- but I cannot get rid of the mildew.  Mildew rules our tub. It has a kingdom there. And it's a kingdom that was established the day we moved in, because Mrs. Verynice's tub was mildew-free.  Our old Rowhouse tub was mildew-free, too, the day we moved out. S put up new sheetrock and a whole new surround, after he set me loose on the old tile with a mini sledgehammer.  There are two species of mildew: the Entrenched Black (EB) and the Transient Pinkish Orange (TPO). TPO falls victim to rigorous cleaning, if you play your cards right, and it's in a good and forgiving mood. EB goes nowhere. I've made a shortlist of things to try on it.  1. Blowtorch 2. Metal file (the kind people use to break out of prison) 3. Hydrochloric acid (pick up hazmat suit at time of purchase)  S exhorts, "Well, it needs all new caulk, is what it needs!" God, S with a caulk gun. First, convincing him it's a good idea --  weeks  -- then all kinds of drama about how much TIME he needs to do it and what it will cost -- then the trip to Home Depot, which is  endless , then the cursing about what he forgot to buy, then BACK to Home Depot, all with P in tow because she loves helping him with home improvement. Then my bathroom in a state of disarray for weeks . . .   (Scary Flashback to the First Anonymous Rowhouse's Bathroom Improvement Projec  t:    To protect the sheetrock before S had a chance to glue the surround, a series of tarps and towelling secured with clothespins entrap the showerer in a small semicircle in the tub. The faucet is also broken, because the old fixture breaking was the impetus for the new tub surround.       So one needs to turn on the shower with a special pair of pliers, because let's face it, we're ghetto and proud. One time I made my shower too hot -- S took the pliers for something else in the interim-- and there I was trapped between the goddamned tarps and clothespins, shouting for help. First degree burns are fun!)   But back to our story. So to even get the caulk gun into S's hands is a supreme effort, but once in, he refuses to rescind it. If you sit still long enough, he will pipe a fine line of caulk around  you.  No crevice escapes his regard. It goes on forever. In the old house, he caulked so long and with such vigor I began to think that blue metal gun was a new appendage, a la Edward Scissorhands.  "Place is full of holes!" he'll trumpet. The cat's water bowl has had a layer of ice on it in the entire winter from the draft coming in, but you didn't notice them until  now  . . .?  Anyway . . .  Back to mildew.  So mildew cleaner and their ilk are worthless. All they do is put a bleach taste in the back of my throat so strong it takes a day to go away. Brillo is pointless, because then all the TPO just turns blue. That little bleach pen they came out with? A complete scam. I thought it would be like a felt tip, like you could really direct the bleach, but it's just like a tube and you squeeze regular bleach spray out onto the mildew while the TPO chortles like it's being tickled.  And the shower curtain liner! Okay, this last one I bought at the dollar store because they're never long for this world, but it actually said MILDEW RESISTANT. What kind of resistance are we talking about? It seems to me it is more of the door-to-door salesman variety than the  coup d'etat  type. This is how a conversation between the shower curtain and the mildew might go:  MILDEW: Mind if I pop in for a spell? SHOWER CURTAIN: No . . . no, I really couldn't. My hair is still in rollers, and I haven't put the kettle on . . . MILDEW: Pshaw! It won't take but a moment to boil. I've got some new tea here for us to try. (flashes package) SHOWER CURTAIN: Is that  Darjeeling?   Anyway, I've given up. I wipe it down and all, but I've admitted defeat. So if you come to the Rowhouse, if you're feeling nosy and look into my tub, you'll see the sign that says, " SANITIZED BUT STAINED."  And I'm throwing away the curtain liner as soon as the dollar store gets a new shipment in.

      I'm not supposed to miss my mother in the summertime.   She was alive in the summer.   Autumn -- okay. She died on September 21, 1985, a Saturday. At 9:05 PM. At the age of forty four. Of metastatic breast carcinoma.   It was the last day of summer.   The day we buried her -- I kid you not, it was the following Wednesday -- I left the house that I had lived in my entire childhood and moved along with my father and brother into a new house, only this one had a stepmother and two stepsisters who didn't like me very much.   And didn't acknowledge that I had buried my mother that morning.   But no. Summertime is for remembering, not for grieving. For quiet mornings and sun dappled afternoons, for petunias in the container garden, for bees in the clover. Summertime is not for grieving.   So whatever has possessed me to the listen to Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon these past few days -- I even stretched to it this morning -- must be some sick, masochistic part of myself trying to play a malevolent joke.   Dark Side of the Moon was the soundtrack for the week my mother died.   In 11th grade, which is where I was -- and she died in the third week -- never mind that I was only 14, I was years ahead in some ways and years behind in others -- in 11th grade, my friends and I were into sixties revival, Crosby Stills and Nash, Vanilla Fudge, head music.   Pink Floyd.   In fact, the night before she died I was supposed to go with Erica and Doug to Doug's house and listen to Floyd on headphones in his darkened bedroom. I went to the hospital instead, while Erica had to hang out at my house, poor girl.   I remember being pissed off -- so fourteen of me, but I hated myself for it for years afterward -- that I had to allow death and cancer and comas and vigils interrupt my classic rock socializing.   It's hard to even get to that time in my head now, but this album -- it's playing now -- is kind of like when you open a bottle of old perfume.   It's better to remember the summer before it all happened.   My dad wanted me to get a job in a steak shop, but so what? I had bigger fryers to drain. I went downtown everyday to the community college for a young writers' workshop. Yes, even back then I was deluding myself.   That was a month long. My mother didn't live with us -- my parents were divorced. She had a little place down near the Margaret-Orthodox el station, close to where she grew up and adjacent to the park where she met my dad, introduced by a mutual friend, while he was hanging upside down in a tree.   Later on, I was to buy the mutual friend's childhood home -- the first Anonymous Rowhouse. As you can see there are wheels within wheels.   Second brother was working construction down the shore and was living in a second-floor walkup with a divorcee. That's prime Ocean City real estate now, and you can't even fart within vicinity of that corner without it costing you a twenty, but back then it was just a random square duplex with straw mats on the floor.   After my writing class, even though my mother was most probably dying -- she was&nbsp;quite sick&nbsp;for years to be honest, but lived above it, and she had an active social life, so it's not like she actually wanted us little bastards breathing down her neck -- I went down the shore for the last two weeks of my childhood.   And what a childhood it was! In cahoots with my cousin Maidink, who lived with an aunt down there in the summers, we got in all kinds of trouble of the most giggly kind, with the pinball machines clinking and pinging in the background.   There was a romance with J from upstate PA, who was very sweet. It was only spoiled by the arrival of my actual city boyfriend F (" I thought we were seeing other people!"),  but resumed as soon as F went back to his shore point.   I grieved my bad luck to Maidink of F's finding me at all, but she wisely pointed out that there was one arcade on the boardwalk where everyone hung out, so what were the odds that he  wouldn't  find me there?   It was a giddy, breathless, adolescent time of wearing bikinis ( those  days are over) and using the wrong tanning oil and paying for it with a bad sunburn.   Second brother was busy with his  own  girlfriend, so I may as well have been down there entirely by myself, but that was fine with me. I knew how to take care of myself. I went to school in center city Philly from the time I was nine and nothing that could happen in Ocean City on the worst day held a candle to an average cumulative&nbsp;risks of&nbsp;a&nbsp;subway ride after school.   Then, the phone rang one morning.   "It's time to come home," one of my brothers said. "Mom needs you."   No one had told  me  -- but they had been taking turns,  taking turns  all summer staying with her. Because she was too sick to be alone.&nbsp;Her cancer went from breast to bone, and bone goes from bone to organ. Bone cancer's okay for a while -- it's just crippling, excruciating, and more pain than a soul should have to endure on this earth without heroin, but not deadly. But let it hit your liver, your lung, your brain -- then things become really fraught, or at least they did in 1985.   My mom's hit her brain. At the back of her neck. She knew it, too. She was the most articulate person I ever knew, and she began to stutter, which drove her crazy.   I said goodbye to everyone, the beach, the boardwalk -- to J and Maidink -- and went on back to the city, where I packed a bag and took the bus and the el down to Margaret Orthodox to stay with my mom.   Why did they send me there? Did they think we needed to talk? We tried to talk. She tried to tell me some things -- things you wouldn't tell a fourteen year old girl if you had time. We had a sex talk that dissolved us both into blushes and giggling. We talked a lot in the middle of the night, because she was always awake during the nights. I saw her change once -- I had never seen my mother even semi-clothed, she was very private about her body and her scar -- and I saw her profile, so different from mine, with her back half-turned from me.   I was a badass Pink Floyd rocker, so I said, "I'm not going to your funeral. I hope you don't mind." And she said, "What do I care? I won't be there."   When she finally did die, about six weeks later in the hospital, I went, of course. I was afraid she would haunt me if I stayed home listening to Dark Side of the Moon.   I never got back to Ocean City until&nbsp;I was about twenty seven or eight. I was down with work, for a staff retreat. The director owned a place there up in the mid-forties.   One afternoon, I went for a walk by myself, down one of the familiar streets. And all in a rush it came to me -- that  feeling  -- as if I could turn a corner and find my fourteen year old self, smiling and knowing that things always do work out for the best, before my mom left and I found out differently.&nbsp; As if she could somehow give my dead childhood back to me.   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      Questions I've always wanted answered&nbsp; . . .   1. How come I can't wink with both my eyes?   2. Why do people who have straight hair always want curly hair, and vice versa?   3. Why do cats not like it when you pet their fur the wrong way?   4. Are we all going to get to heaven at the same time, or are some people already there and looking down on us?   5. How much wood  could  a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?   6. Why didn't I marry for money?   7. How come those "no hunting" signs say "POSTED" when clearly, the fact that they are on the trees at all tacitly implies that they are indeed posted?   8. How come the nicer you are to your child, the more she misbehaves?   9. When will gigantic white t-shirts on urban youths that hang down to the knees like a nightshirt finally go out of style?   10. Why do people who claim to have had past lives always say they were an Egyptian queen?   &nbsp;

      1. I am related to W.C. Fields.   2. I graduated dead last in my high school class of 28 (okay, I did have an 89 average, and okay, it  was  Doogie Howser High, but still).   3. ALa71 and I attended Christian Girl Scouts AND Bible camp in the early 80's.   4. With bad hair.   5. I can't count money fast the way bank tellers do.   6. I can wiggle my ears.   7. My mother used to say I couldn't walk and chew gum, but I've made it my life's work to perfect that very skill.   8. I take two or three showers a day. I am a professional showerer.   9. I don't drink as a rule, but if I do I go straight to the hard stuff, i.e. twelve year old Scotch or really good bourbon -- like Maker's Mark. I call it "the path of the least resistance." At a recent wedding, everyone mocked me for getting Glenlivet "neat" -- and the ignoramus barkeep filled an orange juice glass&nbsp;to the brim with&nbsp;the stuff. I'm a "lightweight" (in alcohol consumption, not in life), so I only had a few sips -- it was a shame to waste it. My cousin later told my aunt about the four thousand dollar bar tab -- of which I'm sure that drink was a significant percentage.   10. I have never tried smoking, done any recreational drug, or been drunk in my life, the previous admission notwithstanding. Yes, I am that much of a goody-goody.   11. My favorite animals as a child were monkeys -- not cats. I am such a cat maniac people find this hard to believe, but I was never allowed to have a monkey ("they throw poop," my mother said.) Cats are very monkeylike, in their own way.   12. I spend a lot of time crying over people I don't know.   13. I am so afraid of mice that a wet ball of lint in a dark corner of my washtub appeared to have legs and a tail, and I refused to even touch it, and S scooped it up and chased me outside with it for his own amusement.   14. I am not afraid of roaches; they just startle me.   15. I have eaten bear (not my choice), alligator, and various other vile game meats under duress.&nbsp;Once each.   16. Last spring P and I had a near-death experience in the car involving a downed wire, and we lived to tell the tale.   17. If I were condemned and had to choose a last meal, it would be Frosted Mini Wheats and raisin toast (I know, I'm a cheap date).   18. I am both my parents' favorite, and my father wanted all girls. My brothers tortured me my entire childhood -- jealousy. Too bad they had to go through those three before getting to magical me!   &nbsp;

      I guess if God gives each person her cross to bear in life, mine would be the seems-simple-but-really-isn't act of trying to get my instinct to trump my anxiety. Every time.   I was never a natural mother. Or at least I convinced myself I wasn't. From even before the sperm hit the egg, I understood on about 85 levels the daunting task before me. It  still  daunts me, every day. And my kid can't be in the same room as a peanut, so it's like daunt-on-steroids with every breath. Living the unexamined life has never been my forte.   After&nbsp;P was born and they stripped the sheets off my hospital bed while I was still gushing blood every time I cleared my throat and sent us back to our first Rowhouse, I was truly amazed that without any effort at all except a good diet and regular medical care (and some supplemental hardcore hormone drugs), some unseen force of greatness had given me a person with one head, ten each toes and fingers, a heart that beat, lungs that breathed, little black-cherries for eyes and even hair!   At the end, on my scans just before her birth, there is her crazy hair like the tendrils of moon jellies in the womb. Her hair is really long now, and curly. It goes all the way down to her butt. And she wears little glasses -- she looks every inch the studious, poindextery, lizard-and-bug loving little daughter of a physics-major father that she is.   But back to the early days. When your milk comes&nbsp;in on day three or four,&nbsp;a flood of emotion comes with it. It is inexplicable. I felt pretty good&nbsp;during my pregnancy -- in contrast to my typical Eeyore self -- preoccupied, but pumped. I actually loved being pregnant --&nbsp; I wasn't sick -- and it agreed with me. I was a cute pregnant person with great skin -- rather like a weebul with a Campbell-Soup-Kid head and expression. The whole thing rocked: no exercise, all-you-can-eat and everything tasting awesome, and the&nbsp;doting attentions of an adoring man.&nbsp;   Friends tell me this changes in subsequent pregnancies&nbsp;but I haven't had the chance to test this theory. Your first pregnancy, he'll run out and buy you sweet peppers in the middle of the night in the rain, but the second pregnancy and beyond, he expects you to move all the furniture in the living room and vacuum without his view of the game on TV being blocked even once.   So&nbsp;there I was, with a three-day-old, wailing, nonsleeping P, and with nothing tasting good to me anymore but Lucky Charms and caffeine free Pepsi,&nbsp;bawling my eyes out at the little expression on P's face that wondered, "Is this lady up to the job?" I know it's insane.   I guess I proved that I was. Although I don't have a mom, and I don't have a sister, so daily conversations with ALa71 really saved me and absolutely nothing else did. It's not like there was a support&nbsp;wagon out front telling me to put my feet up while they took care of the baby. When S wasn't home, I was completely on my own. I watched a lot of Woody Allen movies at the beginning with a sleeping baby on my lap. And&nbsp;I figured out mothering day by day.   Then the time came for her to learn to eat.   I come from a really allergic family, so I did what the American Academy of Pediatrics said and breastfed and gave nothing else for the first six months. The first day we tried cereal, she made faces but ate it. And so it went with the baby foods -- sweet potatoes, squash, oatmeal, applesauce and so on. The first foods. The least allergenic ones.   Then she stopped.   Yes, my daughter stopped eating entirely at about age 10 months.   At first I didn't worry too much -- or else I consoled myself with the platitudes that prevent you from dying of panic. Pickiness, some said. Give her a hot dog! She'll eat that. The doctor and everyone else I asked said, "Well, give her time; she can still nurse to sustain her caloric needs, you don't really need to worry about it until after she's one."   She turned one. She still wouldn't eat.   Not only wouldn't she eat -- she would cry about it. Really cry. And scream. If you went near her with food she would freak out as if you were offering her a hot poker. I called the doctor again. And again. He said, finally:   Make an appointment for her at the feeding clinic at Best Kid's Hospital in the Country. They'll get it sorted out and make you feel better about what you're doing.   Best Kid's has a waiting list a mile long to get a splinter evaluated, much less a developmental delay. I made the appointment -- I filled out their ridiculous Great American Novel of paperwork -- and&nbsp;we went, jazzed to the nines, terrified of what they'd say.   Because now she was thirteen months old. The nursing was doing her okay -- she wasn't ill -- but she was thin. Not gaining. Not growing. Not good.   My baby, a plump, rosy, juicy&nbsp;75th percentile for weight until age 10 months -- now 5th percentile. She just was not getting enough calories -- human milk is not complete nutrition, calorically speaking, after age one. Still 95th for height -- which she has maintained her whole life. She's tall, like her dad.   Up until the appointment, I'd tried everything. This is how we learned about the food allergies. Sometimes, the stuff I'd encourage her to eat gave her hives all over her face when she spit it out. Back then, it was one more thing to vault me straight through to holy terror, but in retrospect I think it was a mercy. If she'd been "normal," and I'd been "peanut butter," things could've turned really ugly.   Luckily we had this giant monkey wrench in the works, so Trying New Things became not just secondary, but so far at the bottom of the list as to be almost insignificant. And lucky for us, because her food allergies are  fierce.  Nothing to&nbsp;mess around with on any day. Three epi-pens with her at all times. Complete caution in every situation for both premise and ingestion.   Back at the Best Kids Feeding Clinic,&nbsp;they were&nbsp;not operating with a full deck. They seemed to have one treatment protocol that they applied to every situation. The first time, a bunch of chatty ladies barged into the exam room (where tiny, skinny&nbsp;P with tear-filled eyes was wearing a little blue flannel gown with a dog on it that said "Perfect Patient") carrying a tray of stuff she could not eat.&nbsp;Underlying medical conditions were not even mentioned until a month later, and then a medication was prescribed that tasted so bad I couldn't even make her take it with the strong immature tongue-thrust reflex she still had.   Feeding tubes were bandied about; I was told I had a negative attitude and she needed hospitalization because I was&nbsp; clearly too stressed out by the whole thing to manage it properly. But, I was told, there was a five-month waiting list for the hospitalization program and intensive eating occupational therapy -- maybe more. Did I want her to be on the list?   My skinny P, nursing all day long, only losing a half a pound, but not eating, not eating.   I did put her on the list -- I didn't know what else to do. They recommended referral to this and that specialist there at the hospital. Each one, the usual long wait, the usual Book of Info to be filled out, the usual warehousing and one-size fits all.   Well, it didn't fit me, on the most instinctive level, that's for sure. So after all the demoralization and eddying around&nbsp;in the backwaters of Whether I&nbsp;Was Actually&nbsp;a Good&nbsp;Mother,&nbsp;I found some of my old&nbsp;pluck and told them off, with my little sick baby there playing with Winnie the Pooh blocks.   I told them where to stick their feeding tube -- I suspected a milk allergy even then and I didn't feel there was a formula in the world she could've taken that would not have made her anaphylax. I told them where to stick their negative attitude and their plate of bullshit she couldn't even eat. And I left, not sure if we'd ever go back. They were utterly useless.   We didn't go back. Instead, we got a miracle.   S asked his boss World Renowned Surgeon about a GI referral -- clearly there was something more going on with our little P that Kids Best planned to string us through a hundred month-intervals to pad their pockets in order to discover. There wasn't time, though, so it was on a summer day with my dad in tow that I went to see Dr. Irish.   Dr. Irish is a big, wonderful man with a soft voice that I wanted to secretly tape so that I could listen to it in moments of doubt.&nbsp; He also had extensive experience doing studies on food-allergic kids at Feeding Clinic in Another State, so I knew he came well-recommended. He looked at my little P, tousled her curls and said, "Look at her, she's perfect."   I started to cry. "But when will she  eat ?"   "Not for a while yet," Dr. Irish said.   Dr. Irish wrote me a scrip for a better-tasting reflux drug that Kids Best had told me was "impossible to obtain." My pharmacy filled it that afternoon. P gained two pounds in two weeks on my milk alone.   Dr. Irish also recommended that we see a doctor in his office -- now in private practice -- whose life's work was teaching children to eat.   And so began our fourteen months of Occupational Therapy with Dr. Wonderful.   "What were they talking, feeding tube?" Dr. Wonderful wanted to know. "Her stomach holds what it holds until the reflux and pooping issues are fixed. Doesn't matter where it comes from."   Once at week at first, then every two weeks, then every month -- teaching P to eat spoon by spoon and bite by bite. She finally chewed when she turned 2. She just had the Holy Grail of Mature Chewing about four months ago this year -- a raw carrot -- over a year and a half after she graduated from Feeding Clinic with Dr. Wonderful.   P and Dr. Wonderful were not fast friends. Because P is a pistol, there was a time, for example, when P was not happy about Dr. Wonderful's vigilance, as she sat there in her highchair, buckled in. P made herself gag, and threw up gallons of avocado and baby food all over the clinic floor -- when she'd only eaten several ounces!   There was Mommy and Dr. Wonderful cleaning P's puke with wet paper towels, with Dr. Wonderful commenting, "Well, at least we know the acid medicine is working -- it doesn't smell too bad!"   P gave Dr. Wonderful a Swiffer wet mop for Christmas in apology for the stunt.   Our little P is still being treated for reflux -- she takes Prilosec, the other purple pill, twice a day, as pellets in applesauce -- under the supervision of Dr. Irish. Dr. Wonderful went on to run a feeding clinic in another state-- God saw to it that when we needed her, there she was, in private practice right here in PA.   Kids Best called in January of the following year, by the way, six months after I put P on the list. I was thrilled to no end to be able to say, "No thanks, give the slot to another kid, because P eats."&nbsp; Nonplussed, they asked how such a miracle occurred, and I replied simply, "Dr. Wonderful." They knew her, of course -- she is the finest neurodevelopmental pediatrician for feeding disorders in the whole goddamned country.  Her weight is back at 50th percentile, right on target for her age, and she's as tall as a six-year-old. People think she's older than she really is.   And so when we go to the zoo now -- which we're thinking about doing this afternoon, which is what got me started on this -- I look around at all the Mackenziekennakyliecodysavannahaidans everywhere, chowing down on their cheese puffs and their apple slices, and I think, no, no, no ! Look at my P, look at my P! She eats! She eats.   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      I was actually pictured in my college's recruiting materials in the late eighties with the quote, "Someday I would like to publish an anthology of poetry, with a picture of me in a strange hat on the back."   So far this has not come true, and in effect I have given up on poetry. I still write it and even publish some on the internet, but my dream of being Pablo Neruda or Dylan Thomas and streaking like a comet across the literary firmament at the tender age of 19 was thwarted by various graduate schools who rejected my applications for a fellowship in various MFA programs in creative writing. Maybe it was thwarted by me alone because my writing sucks, I don't know. (I blamed the shitty economy at the time, there was no money in humanities for scholarships, but I&nbsp;called one place which shall remain nameless&nbsp;:::cough University of Pittsburgh cough::: to find out why I was rejected and the student worker who answered the phone said, "I think it was your writing sample.")&nbsp;I've always kind of felt that poetry is so subjective that it really doesn't matter.   ANYWAY, I went down this whole road in secular romance and Christian publishing&nbsp; -- writing one "regular" and two historical Christian romances. (See post on romance novels below, "The Heaving Bosoms of History," for a further discussion of this subject). Now, saddled with my latest rejection, I am slated to go to a Christian writers conference in two weeks -- that's costing me decent money I don't have -- and I have absolutely no idea why I'm going. It vexes me every time I think about it.   I'll have editor and agent appointments there, and what am I going to say? "I have two manuscripts here, both were rejected for various reasons, why don't you see what you think?" As I said before one editor&nbsp; had one for  a year and a half.  That is a long goddamn time to sit on somebody's work and string them along with a glimmer of hope. One writing acquaintance said, and an agent even asked me about my other book, "Well, did they tell you  why  they rejected it?"   The kicker is that they don't. You can correspond in a friendly fashion all you want, but in the end you get the same form letter as anyone else.   I could rant on about the inequity in publishing today. What you always hear is that there are too few spots for new authors. But, you go to the bookstore and every celebrity that takes a shine toward trying their hand at a children's book has a big glossy display filled to the brim with gleaming, twenty-dollar hardbacks. There doesn't appear to be any quality anymore in a lot of what's being published -- and I'm not saying that my books have quality, but you know what I mean. There are industries dedicated to what strikes an editor's fancy. I have bought (and read) many of these books. After a while it's all noise.   And this is why: no one can tell anyone else how to write. And frankly, the magic in writing is the not knowing and the seeking and the finding, the going to a place where no one can tell you what to do but you know you're doing it right. And yet that doesn't jive with publishing most of the time.   Semi-related anecdote: My old boss, an extraordinary South African woman who made me laugh my brains out every day of the eight years we worked together, used to travel a lot. We were in nonprofit (higher ed) and she ended up trying to save the college money by eating in all kinds of truckstops and dives. She's one of those people that lunatics and transients gravitate to instantly -- even worse than me. Anyway, she's sitting somewhere in the south eating something in some place, and this guy comes up to her and sits next to her at the counter. He's dressed kind of shabbily, real down-on-his-luck and sighing, so of course she has to inquire after his welfare. He tells some hard luck story, and at the end of it, looks her right in the eye and says:   There's them's that's got it, and them's that don't. And them's that got it,  wear suits.

      I swear, I need a wife.  As I lug a triple-layer hefty of last week's leftovers out to the Cavalcade of Cans in the rear of the Anonymous Rowhouse, I am thinking this to myself, as I always do.   Wouldn't it be nice to come home to . . . !   The sentence goes unfinished. I confess to simmering resentments at times.  This post pertains to the humble refrigerator, viz.: anytime something has an aura of mystery to it, the day before trash day, I cull it.  S has no problem eating perpetual leftovers (see post below, keyword: corned beef hash). But I feel it my duty in this life to inform him,&nbsp; that not  everything  lasts forever. Not even meat in the freezer.   No. Not even that.  In fact he mocks me because I never use the phrase "in perpetuity" unless it has to do with food in the refrigerator that he intends to eat (i.e. "sushi is not edible in perpetuity") or regarding T-shirts that I wouldn't clean up dog crap with, that are three sizes too small, that he got in 1984 as a Christmas gift, that he insists on wearing, or when he intends to get a haircut&nbsp;-- but that is all for another post.  So, I do this when he's not home, the food purging, because he never would. And if I do it while he's here, he stands next to me as I scoop and grimace, going, "I could still eat that! Leave it in there! I'll eat it tonight!"  He never does, of course. Another week goes by . ..&nbsp; another week . . . and then, there it is, his prized snack, STILL in its foil looking like a hastily-wrapped turd and chuckling malevolently, waiting for me to deal with it&nbsp;. . .later rather than sooner.  Just like I rifle through his drawers and take his old underwear for the rag bag -- and buy new underwear for him, in a size larger than he says he needs because he is no longer a&nbsp;32, I don't care what he says . . .  &nbsp;. . .&nbsp;which also ends up clean and folded in his drawers for his express use, without his ever&nbsp;having to lift a finger.  :::sigh::: It must be nice.  People call women control freaks, but many men read this blog, some married and some not, but surely all of you have lived alone at some point in your lives. How did you handle the refrigerator and its contents over time?  Did you: A. Let things turn green, spawn fur, sprout legs, open the door for themselves, walk into your bedroom and wake you in the night if the dog needed to be let out?  B. Have no food in your fridge at all apart from two beers, a jar of mustard and an ancient Chinese takeout container?  C. Don and apron and clean the fridge with a song on your lips and joy in your heart?  D. (extra credit)  Regularly?    &nbsp; E. Think, "Eventually I'll shack up with some broad and she'll do it then?"  This is a part of the male mind that&nbsp;baffles me. Do you really feel entitlement to such things as a clean fridge full of edible foods, and you register an unalienable right that such a thing should be provided by someone else without your ever having to think about it?  S would answer, "Oh, #*#!, yeah!"  Okay, so I may air our dirty laundry (he doesn't read this BTW), but he is one lucky bastard. He won't realize it until ALa71 is eulogizing me, of course.

      Here in the Anonymous Rowhouse we take our pillows seriously. I do, anyway. I get such a sore neck from sleeping on a crappy -- or even a good, but not right for me -- pillow. Last night I slept on a random pillow and not my own, and I'm paying for it today. I have a whole range of rejects just lying around the room, so when P comes in our bed she has one.   I've tried those memory foam ones, by the way. It sort of worked until the weight of my giant head squished the foam after a few months, and now it is in the random pile with all the others.  My current favorite is a Martha Stewart Kmart Custom Sleeper Side Sleeper pillow. It's like a Flintstones pillow -- hard as a rock, but it rules. My chiropractor says it's important to get the pillow into that little pocket between your neck and shoulder. Otherwise I cantilever my entire body weight off my head, and THAT makes for grumpy mommy in the morning. ............................................  I found an empty bin in the sink this morning from week-old corned beef hash. S ate it! The man could live on locusts and honey in the desert. He has an iron-clad consitution. I'm a princess; I can't eat anything that isn't farm fresh or wildly processed without consequences.  .......................................  The weather in Philly is horrible! It's been days of this SOUP and rain interspersed with the odd hot, sunny day where you squint because you've been living like a cave dweller all the rest of the time. It is most definitely NOT summer with all its&nbsp;attendant associations.&nbsp;This morning, my house had that wet-dog (as before, in the absence of a dog) stink, and as I changed the litterpans (daily) and walked the trash outside, the whole WORLD stunk like a dead skunk on a burnt tire. Yuck.  In times like these, I wish the lazy and disinclined would clean the wet dog dirt off their lawns -- it adds to the general effluvium.   ...............................  I keep having heart palpitations. Either it means I'm more out of shape than I thought, my medication is causing some grave side effect, or I need to ignore it as usual and wait until it either goes away or kills me.  ..............................  I realized (while loading the dishwasher, my life's work) that there is a difference between weariness and tiredness. I am bone-weary, but I got&nbsp;enough sleep last night. I think it's just the drudgery; if I were able to go to a spa, for example, with ALa71 and have my feet massaged by a shirtless, tanned, iron-pumping sweet-talker named Constantine, I could probably find it in myself to perk up. Even  with  the rain.  ......................................... P's sing-a-long tape contains numerous tongue-twisters. She ranks them according to difficulty, but she takes my word as to whether they're hard before trying them. Here are some of them to run through your head, since they never leave mine.&nbsp; I'll share the horror.  A big black bug bit a big black bear.  But she bought the better butter, and her batter wasn't bitter, so 'twas better Betty Botter bought a bit of better butter.  A skunk sat on a stump and thunk the stump stunk. But the stump thunk the skunk stunk.  (editor's note: topical for outdoor Philadelphia today!)    &nbsp; Three tree toads tied together tried to trot to town.  A tutor who tutored the flute, tried to tutor two tutors to toot.   A flea and a fly in a flue, were imprisoned -- so what could they do? Said the flea: let us fly! Said the fly: let us flee! So they flew through a flot in the flue.  &nbsp;

      At about 8:30 every night, after the final plastic crocodile has been rinsed and put to bed, and after Dr.Seuss has been read and reread, I settle into the rocker next to P's bed and keep her company in the dark until she falls asleep.   That is really the finest time of my day. It's so dark, and so quiet, and I reflect on everything that has gone and everything that will come.   She whispers, "I love you!" and I whisper it back, and we say sorry to each other if we've had a bad day and thank each other if we've had a good day, and we try not to talk too much but the silence is so fond and vast and we know each other in the same way we have from the very first day.   Sometimes I skip this time and S does it -- he likes it, too, sitting there with her. Back when I nursed, it was this last feeding of the day that put her to sleep and calmed me down too, and once she was weaned I wondered if we could ever replace it. We have.   I know what the parenting books say. Put her to bed -- and run! Go downstairs, watch TV, she needs to  learn . She needs to learn to be alone.   Why should she have to? Just lately, I've been sitting there a few minutes then leaving her while she's still awake. (Don't shut the door! she says, and I leave it open, and Fairycat visits her. Another parenting no-no: she is an allergic child, and you let a  cat  into her bedroom! Well, she's not allergic to cats, so nanny-nanny-foo-foo to you, allergy establishment).   I have not just a wonderful time of communion sitting there with her, but I often pray. Sometimes I visualize Jesus in my head, and He has a fondness for chambray shirts and park benches. Unlike many people I know, He's always happy to see me. Jesus has the best smile.   I remember just as I weaned her I substituted singing for feeding. My P, I am pleased to brag, has a beautiful singing voice. She has perfect pitch, and her little voice beneath mine is that of an angel. I marvel at this little person, this perfection from God, so fearfully and wonderfully made. I remember singing to her when she was inside me, playing music for her, letting her hear my voice, and how when they first let me hold her outside of me, I spoke to her, and she already knew me.   Sometimes we sing "Over the Rainbow," and I think to myself, this fleeting moment, this love, this child, this life. We can't hold it. But we can know it, sitting there in the dark, as the nights go by and my daughter unfolds into the life she was given.

      One visitor to the Rowhouse enquired as to what scrapple was.  The following is taken from habbersettscrapple.com:  History  SCRAPPLE: The Original "Brown 'n' Serve" Food!  More than 200 years ago--long before anyone thought of this clever name--mothers in Colonial America were "browning and serving" a pre-cooked product. Its name was--and still is--"scrapple".   Those lucky families were Dutch colonists who sailed from Holland in 17th and 18th centuries and settled along the Delaware River after clearing land and building log cabins in the majestic White Oak forests that then lined those lovely shores.   Scrapple is probably the first All American pork food. It was "invented" in Chester County, Pennsylvania's oldest settlement--and was the logical result of thriftiness and love of good eating that characterized Chester's early Dutch settlers.   The nourishing liquid and succulent meat bits that remained in the big iron kettle, after liverwurst and other pork products were prepared, could not be wasted. Cornmeal and spices were added, and the mixture was cooked, then jelled in loaf-shaped tins.   Some people confuse its name with the word , scraps, but scrapple was never made from scraps, i.e., defined as waste. At the time the name was given to the then new pork product. It meant small bits or pieces, left-overs or "remnants of value".   Scrapple tasted so good, was so easy to serve in so many different ways, that it soon became a favorite dish, growing in popularity as the country grew. Benjamin Franklin refers affectionately to Philadelphia's scrapple in his first writings. George Washington's cook was Pennsylvania Dutch, and the first President's fondness for scrapple lasted his life-time.  The colonists also liked scrapple's long "keeping" quality. This was important when automatic refrigerators--or even ice-boxes--were unheard of. To preserve food during the warm months the settlers built small "ice houses," sunk half-way into the cool ground. During the winter they cut blocks of ice from ponds, lakes, rivers and stored them under a thick layer of sawdust. Here they kept their perishable foods, hoping that the supply of ice would last through the summer.   Meats that were salt or smoke cured lasted longest. Scrapple was next on the list--adding a "fresh" tasting meat dish to the colonists', limited menus.  Habbersett, pride of the "Scrapple Capital," is made from the family's secret recipe, unchanged since the company's founding, more than 100 years ago. Even then, the hogs were prime, lean, mid-westerners. Habbersett's is real old-fashioned country scrapple, a generous blend nutritious flavored lean pork, stone ground whole wheat flour, highest quality cornmeal, salt and natural spices. It's still made on the same farmland where it originated. Only the people, buildings and techniques have changed, and they are among the industry's most efficient.

       urlLink    Though it doesn't really match my mood, it certainly can be true.  S, the modern workhorse of the apocalypse, got in around one o'clock. I was already in bed, but I remember going "yeaaarghg!" a la Mr. Dean when he came in the room -- I get hyped up about intruders to the Anonymous Rowhouse when I go to bed alone, and usually bring P in with me in case of somnolent cataclysm. He understands that I tend to go into full-lashout mode when he barges in when I'm half-asleep.&nbsp;He's still here now fighting with Fairycat over the rules of paper-ball fetching. He needs to get to work momentarily for another late night.   We went out the breakfast at the Icon Diner because P is in school this morning. The Icon is the heart and soul of the world of the anonymous rowhouse, and they make the best damned creamed chipped beef this side of anywhere. S had eggs and scrapple, of course, because you're not from Philadelphia if you don't eat whatever's left on the abbatoir floor which is then&nbsp;hosed into a bucket&nbsp;and formed into a sort of meatcake with sage to cover the taste of entrail.   The Icon is classic -- a big, shiny, silver dining car with middle-aged, just as pleasant and worldly-wise as they come waitresses in pink uniforms and a whole line of stools along a long, sparkling counter which is backed by boxes of frosted flakes and pies under domes. On the stools are the lonely and the lovelorn, who say things to the waitresses like:  -Twenty years ago! What I wouldn't do to be back there. -We ALL would, hon. -If I knew then . . . -You got that right, doll.  It's an experience just being there. I love going.  &nbsp;

      Now I know I have PMS -- butterflies flitting through the garden are making me tear up with their beauty.  GOD, I hate my head some days. I have been lugging this annoying brain of mine around quite consciously since I was eighteen months old. I have very real memories of that time; mainly because my mother was sick my entire life with cancer until she died when I was 14, and that kind of thing has a way of making an impression no matter what your age.&nbsp;I remember walking through a neighbor's garden -- it  had  to have been then, that's when it happened, I later discovered -- and saying, "My mommy's in the hospital. She has blood poisoning."  The neighbor was taking care of me, because my mom couldn't. I remember having a little spade in my hand -- I think it was turquoise plastic -- and there were flower pots, the terra cotta ones.  My mom&nbsp;had no lymph nodes in her right&nbsp;armpit, because back in those days --1972 or&nbsp;73 --&nbsp;the kind of surgery she had for her cancer was really an all-or-nothing proposition. So, my dad told me she was cleaning a window or something and got dirt in a cut on her finger and next thing you know she was about to lose an arm.   She didn't lose her arm, though -- they put her on some IV antibiotics and that did her infection in. Good news for her.  But see, on PMS days (and I have hormone issues, so who knows if it's  truly  PMS) I dwell not so much on maudlin anecdotes as that as I do on just the utter tenderness of life, like the beating heart of a newborn chick.  I was lying in bed this morning trying to get back to sleep after P's omnipresent screaming woke me up, and I tried counting blessings, not to be a Hallmark card, but because I felt this&nbsp;massive crying dam about to&nbsp;burst in my brain. If I let it go -- if I can't sandbag fast enough -- then I go through three, four, five days of depression -- or longer, much longer.   So here were my blessings:  I am in a warm bed with clean sheets in a solid house with a good roof, sleeping next to a child I never thought I'd have, in a climate-controlled room. I have clean clothes to wear and electricity in my house and food to eat down in the refrigerator, which runs twenty four hours a day. I have all my limbs, my sight, and my hearing, and as of my last bloodwork in June all of my organs were functioning in tandem. I had a clean mammogram this year -- my fifth one -- they watch me like a hawk because my mom was diagnosed at 29. I am not a family blacksheep. I have never been pulled over and given a ticket. I have a pleasant, on-key singing voice. Cats come out of the woodwork every time I walk down a street. I have a vast knowledge of medical terminology and I'm not afraid to use it.  I have a fine&nbsp;husband who has put up with my bullshit for&nbsp;going on 19 years now. He doesn't care if I'm not 105 pounds or&nbsp;don't cook a three course meal everyday or make him take out the trash in the rain. We don't have any money, but neither are our creditors hunting us down. We have cars that run adequately even if they are old and even if S's in particular has in its interior an ecosystem all its own. We laugh a lot despite my baseline maudlin personality -- which really cannot ultimately be changed, given all I've seen in my life. But I work hard to overcome whatever shortcomings I perceive and I try to be forgiving of them in others.  I think I feel better now.  It helps to try to remember all this.

      I was awakened by one of P's famous screams, though I think she was laughing/screaming. She's got that little-girl "scream and run for fun in the highest-pitched voice possible" thing down in her waking life.   I must work today (deadline) and I realized I've written 16,000 words or something so far on this -- in a week -- my chiropractor is rubbing his hands together greedily -- so I may be a little quieter than normal. 16,000 words, by the way, is 1/3 through 2 of my novels, and for some reason  those  16,000 words took way longer to write.  As the creative writing establishment says, write about what you know.  I live in perpetual fear that you will all come to see my life for the boring dishwater that it is, but I've managed to&nbsp;cull some impressions out of my meaningless existence in the past week, which surprises me most of all.  Must go back to bed now. More later. jr

      Luckily retail is in striking distance of the Anonymous Rowhouse, so I decided to mix it up a bit this afternoon. I changed out of the pyjamas I changed into after church and took a stroll for some kid-free browsing.   There was nothing much cooking in the card and drug stores, so I moseyed over to the video store where I rented the Drew Barrymore/Ben Stiller comedy and something else -- I can't remember. Oh, right.  Dirty Dancing Havana Nights , because I have been watching reruns of "I Love the 90's" for a straight week. The boy in  Havana Nights  is like Leonardo DiCaprio in  Titanic  -- why? He's certainly not a fantasy hero&nbsp;a grown woman would&nbsp;set her mind to. Perhaps they were skewing it down to the teen audience; but Patrick Swayze wasn't "teen" in the original. Be that as it may,&nbsp;there wasn't much else to rent that I hadn't seen.   I remarked to the goth boy at the video counter (who was wearing very heavy, painful-looking hoop earrings)&nbsp;that you could hear a pin drop in the video store. I&nbsp;whispered that it reminded me of&nbsp;a museum. (There wasn't the usual annoying hip hop music playing). He said, "I wish I worked in a museum." I said, "No, you don't," and he laughed -- I'm not sure why I said that and I'm not sure why he laughed. Maybe he's watched  The Thomas Crown Affair  too many times.   Then it was off to the dollar store. Ah, the smell. I hate the smell of the dollar store -- too much cheap plastic crammed into one space. I have to practically breathe through my mouth to avoid gag reflex.   I tried to pick out the strangest, most improbable things in the dollar store to tell you guys about in the blog. They were:   -  a set of emery boards , over which was screen-printed a scene of luminous poodles in a posh setting -- one portion of the scene per board, like a puzzle. The quality of the portrait was like that popular rumpus room novelty wallart in the 70's -- that cheap plastic made of lines that showed a 3D scene, which made a weird noise if you ran your fingers across it vertically.&nbsp;Frequently, it&nbsp;changed pictures at whatever angle you looked at it.    - a angry warthog plush toy  that looked nothing like Pumbaa. (I was tempted to buy this.)   - a book called Understanding God . For only a dollar!   In line, the guy in front of me (semi-toothless, loud, a little bit of a red-flag) asked the checkout girl, "Do you have twine? You know, string? Twine?"   "No," she said. "We used to, but we sold it all."   I know he was trying to engage me, too, because he kept glancing back at me in a sort of creepy/friendly/creepy way.&nbsp;I was busy loading the conveyor with Laffy Taffy and Tart'n'Tinys (high fructose corn syrup is about as much of an addiction/guilty pleasure that I have), but he kept trying.   "I thought it was just me," he said. "You know, being a man?" Pause. "I usually need my lady to find it for me." Pause &nbsp;"You know."   I hate when men say "my lady." I glanced at the rack of dollar novels and felt an instant rush of pleasure at seeing a romance novel by that man writing as a woman that I told you about.  Women can sense the duplicity!  I thought.  It serves him right!    Anyway, he went then, which was good but I checked my back as I left -- he was that kind of creepy. Then I wandered down to  Made in Swaziland Garment Emporium &nbsp;and took a stroll around.   "Have you lost weight?" I overheard one woman say to another.   "Just twenty pounds so far."   "You look great!"   "You know how it is, though -- once you go to get healthy they send you fifteen more places."   I heard more murmurings -- liver ultrasound and so on -- and then they were joking about how their boobs sagged or didn't, and then I heard her say, "He sent me to the gastrentrologist (sic!) for . . ." and I heard their voices drop again. Something personal that shouldn't be trumpeted across the store.   As I walked home, someone's cell phone was playing the Can Can from inside an open van. Refreshed from my interlude, I felt like kicking up a little bit of heel, myself.

      An ertswhile friend was fond of ocean metaphors, i.e. "friendship is an ocean, you accept the ebb and flow and see what happens;" "anxiety is an ocean, you accept the ebb and flow and see what happens" and on and on.   I said that's fine -- as long as you have a raft -- or an anchor.   My ocean is different. It has rules and order. I guess you can't tell that to the guys in "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner," but when I stand on a beach, I get my head straight the way that other people sometimes do when they stand in a cemetery. There's an absolute Godliness behind that back and forth of the water, and there's a whole world out there that we know nothing about, that goes on just because it does.   I feel intimately connected to the Almighty in the matter of&nbsp;P's own creation and birth. We struggled to have P. It was not an easy road; it was, for me, a trial of epic spiritual proportions. I basically had to move a body that they said could not have a baby into a place where it could. This required a good deal of medical intervention and the genius of Dr.&nbsp;V (my pet name for him because he likes to draw a LOT of blood. The&nbsp;'sweet spots'&nbsp;of my inner arms are complete scar tissue and the phlebotomists really have to dig now to find anything and when they do, the vein blows instantly if they don't use a kid needle.)   Making a baby&nbsp;this way is not for the faint of heart and sadly, many more people are having to go through it. It's a lonely place, like a mountain where there's no sound, and on the top of that mountain are lots of women who don't want to talk to each other, because to encourage means to succeed, and to succeed means to get off the mountain -- a place where everyone desperately wants to be. It's an area of the female experience that is filled with isolation. Yet just because someone else succeeds in making a baby doesn't mean you ever will. There are no guarantees in this business of bringing forth life. In fact, for an anxiety-prone type as myself, the panoply of things that could go wrong and often do is so vast that it nearly stops you in your tracks.   In the early part of my Quest, as I came to call it, I stood by the ocean in February next to S and with a friend -- M -- and it was frozen and cold and hideous and I was wearing my NATO field jacket and wishing I were anywhere else, even though I had asked to go there. Talk about paradox.   Months went by. We had a glimmer of hope in April -- but only a glimmer. There were two follicles, and one took, but only briefly. So the&nbsp;wrench of positive tests when you in fact know&nbsp;there is no baby, the pink stripe fading and fading as the hormone levels go down and down. My two boys' and two girls' names stayed where they were, on a piece of paper in the drawer.   I grew a brittle shell and I made a lot of sardonic comments in my daily interchanges. I took all the fertility statistics and adopted a 50% stance instead&nbsp;-- everything in life has a 50% chance of happening, either it does or it doesn't.   By July I was saying to Dr. V, "Look, character building is all well and good but I want a baby out of this nightmare." And he said, "Do you want to take some time off?" And I said yes. No drugs except the baseline one for my metabolism.   Those drugs are hardcore, by the way. You have to really WANT it. Listen, you read about all these egg donors and so on -- there's a reason they pay these ladies for their gift. It's not sweet tarts and sugarwater you're putting in your body. I used to say to Dr. V, "How come one of the side effects of everything you put me on is death?" He smiled in his cryptic way. I knew I should've bought the man a Magic 8Ball when I had the chance.   So the decision was made in July to just monitor August. Just keep up the bloods and scans and see if anything looked promising, but not to stampede forth with yet another "cycle."   In early August I went with M alone down to the shore again. The evening we arrived we went to the Lighthouse Beach at sunset. Just because we could.   I stood there, breathing in and in and in, the way I always do in front of the ocean, as if to put some of THAT air in my lungs will offset all the pollution and black death I breathe in living in the city.   I was praying -- as usual. I had taken to wearing a St. Jude medal-- patron saint of lost causes --and I was saying to God at that moment,&nbsp;if I'm not supposed to have a baby, then take away the desire for one. Just take it -- make it go! Make me not care, make me not want it, make it go away. I've been fine without one this far and I expect I'll be fine without one if I never have one.   And suddenly, I saw something, out there in that vast ocean, that place that God made and ordered according to His plan, just because it pleased Him and because&nbsp;He felt like it.   What I saw was a fin.   M is from coastal Florida, and knows from aquatic life. I said to her as fast as I could, before it could disappear, "What is that -- a shark?"   "It's a dolphin," she said. As if she expected to see one.   Never in my life had I seen a dolphin in the wild. "Really?" I said. "Have you ever petted one?"   "Yeah," she said. "I have."   "What did it feel like? Was it rubbery?"   "It felt like wet leather," she said.   So we stood there -- watching the dolphins. They were show-offs, those dolphins, doing all kinds of things that a figure skater might attempt. There was a mom and baby, and for the first time in a very long time I felt the shell softening, the thing that had consumed me and that I had tried so hard to effect of my own power for so long becoming, just for that brief moment in time, less subject to my own control. Like something that could be let go.   The sun was coming down and the mellow light played in diamonds off the dolphins' backs as they came closer and closer to shore. Suddenly I prayed,&nbsp; God, you order all this! All this! The tides and all the life in this vast world. I am one woman, with my own tide and cycle that will not order itself, that will not bring the life that is natural to it. Order  me!   Order me.    Monday we returned home and I saw Dr. V. He saw a follicle, so he recommended treatment and I figured, what the hell. Assume the position. Why waste the chance.   And two weeks later, when I peed on the final test of my stockpile on the morning of day 28 -- expressly to know if it was time to start treatment again, because V had told me "bad cycle, bad levels, bad sample, bad lining"&nbsp;--&nbsp;well, wouldn't you know that that stick&nbsp;turned a nice, instant, definite pink.   And now she's out at the mall with her dad today.

      For a while at least, it seemed the&nbsp;stuffed peppers went very, very wrong.   S was late getting them started and I was upstairs trying to get P down for a rare nap so she wouldn't turn into a crabby-crabby (it was only 2:30 and she was acting more like 7:30). So I yelled at him to brown the meat as fast as possible and there wasn't adequate simmer time in the sauce and I threw the rice in and stuffed the peppers and adorned the dish with more of the mixture and threw it in the oven as fast as I could.   But it smelled too . ..&nbsp; meaty.   I don't like working with raw beef because of the e. coli thing and that's why S did it. I usually do turkey instead -- I know, I know, salmonella, but salmonella is a GI disturbance -- okay, a bad one, but unlike e. coli you're not usually talking kidney transplant -- anyway. This is the stuff that goes through my mind at the meat counter. SO, we were out of coffee and he had to run&nbsp; out and get that, and he came back and I said, please taste this and he did.   "It tastes like deer," he said.   "Ew!"   I pulled the whole baking dish, I tonged out the peppers, emptied all the filling into a big pot, and squirted about a half a bottle of ketchup, a cup of sugar and another half-jar of spaghetti sauce into the mix.   It tasted better.   My Aunt and Uncle raved, but who knows? I basically see meat as a substrate for whatever sauce or cheese I'm eating. I don't like meaty flavors. I used to "do" venison for S and the cats -- my brothers hunt, of course, Manly Men that they are -- but I wouldn't touch it. I didn't even like the smell of cooking in the house, but Special Puppet used to turn into "Muttley" from Dick Dastardly and float up into the air and back down over it.   I digress.   The main reason for stuffed peppers was because I have to conjure up dishes we can all eat as a family that don't contain peanuts, treenuts, milk, wheat, eggs or any of their derivatives&nbsp; -- the list is limited -- because of P's allergies. She eats different food from us on the average day, but at special times we don't like for her to feel left out.   Luckily P enjoyed it all too.   I picked a little at bacon on the salad platter and S scolded: "Everyone has to eat from that!" as if my hands were covered with strychnine. He's such a pain sometimes.   I'm tired. I scored "E" for extrovert on Meyers Briggs but only by one point.&nbsp; Am not extrovert. Introvert. Like people for short time, then wish to crawl in hole.   To make the social hell complete, I have liturgy tomorrow -- ugh. Need. Long. Rest. From. Having. To. Speak. Tired. Of. Having. To. Think. Later. About. Things. I. Said. To. People.   Good night everyone.

      (the sound of a cassette being eaten by an old tape player, with requisite screeches)  S: If you don't pull that %$&$&amp;@! thing out of there, I'll -- Me: Mind your business and drive the car! S: It's common knowledge that whomever is driving gets  full dominion  over everything in the car,  including  the tape player. Me: Oh, okay. So how do you explain why everytime I'm driving you still attempt to have full dominion? S: Because I have it then, too. Me: (laughing)

       "I will never do aerobics in front of the television. And I will never read a trashy romance novel."    -Me, walking through KMart with college friend and remarking upon the inventory, shortly before graduating in 1991    Sometime in 1992, I cavorted wildly in front of Kathy Smith's step solution before settling down with a Catherine Coulter novel. And so it began. I ate my own sanctimonious words.  What was the seed that was planted that caused me to donate 45 boxes of the things to a Catholic charity when we moved to the Anonymous Rowhouse? How could my life simply need that much of Reginald's quivering member (™  10 Things I Hate About You )&nbsp;and Georgiana's soughing sighs?  If men say they read  Playboy  for the articles, then I guess my answer would be that I read romance for the history.  Truly.  I have learned more about what shaped our nation&nbsp;from these so-called "trashy" books &nbsp;than from any other stinky high school class or college distribution requirement than I have taken.  Where does the&nbsp;"trashy" come from, then?  The genre really came into its own in the nineteen seventies, and many of the women who were writing then (there are male romance novelists now, writing under female pseudonyms, by the way) are giants in the industry, revered to this day for their amazing storytelling and their ability to create a historical period accurately.  But their style of writing, and the style of the publishers' marketing, is what continues to characterize the genre, even though today's titles and book covers are very different. Romance evolves, just like anything else.  Take a look at little me, lonely as usual because A was probably grounded for some small infraction and my brothers were off at their endless competitive sporting events. I'm&nbsp;picking through the paper bags in the basement of my mother's novels.   Some&nbsp;titles were usually comprised of three components: a romantic notion, an adjective, and an intense emotion or action.   Love's Savage Longing Passion's Ruthless Kiss Forever's Endless Embrace   Alternatively, the titles described some archetypal He-Man:   The Renegade The Trailblazer The Lieutenant    &nbsp; But it was the covers that fascinated me the most as a little girl. There they were, these men and ladies, all surrounded by pink and purple clouds (my favorite colors!) The covers were shiny, the type was raised and golden, and the ladies were wearing gowns of a sort I longed to wear. (I was obsessed, for example, with the Colonial period as a child; I wanted the long bed curtains you could close and to have to wear a mobcap in daily life; I had to settle for a conservative, 1970's canopy that my mother sewed).   Yet the ladies' gowns were coming off and the men were kissing them! And the men -- well, they had lots of muscles and were wearing tight tan pants that were trimmed in fringe. Or else long coats with bits of lace about the throat and wrists.  There were ships and bayous and mansions and exotic greenery fringing the scenes, and I wanted to jump right in, run down the dock and yell, let me join you! I want to sail the seven seas, too!  This was very intriguing to me as a small person. Romance novels are G-rated enough on their covers&nbsp; -- a bit of shoulder, a fluttering eyelash -- that I don't think my mom was committing some parenting sin by leaving them in the paper bags. (The paper bags were for trading them with other romance readers -- a common practice to this day. Obviously, my mom didn't know I was rifling through them as I put them all back carefully. And she was off doing what all 1970's stay-at-home moms did -- either cursing the day my brothers were born or sitting in the kitchen drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes with her friends.)   Certainly these pink-and-purple clouded covers with their hugging moms and dads&nbsp;were preferable in terms of their&nbsp;innocence&nbsp;to the  Easy Rider  calendar that belonged to our friend&nbsp;L's Uncle Thunder next door, which A and I found playing down her basement one afternoon.  One thing I did notice about those old ones! When I finally  did  read them! Is that the tone of them is simply . . .  breathless !  And there is a plethora of italicizing!  And there are a proponderance of exclamation points! As if everything everyone says needs to be animated further .&nbsp; . .! As if no one,  no one  could  believe  that someone would dare to say such a thing at such a time as  that !  But anyway. In between those moments of discovery in the basement and my Catherine Coulter/aerobics phase of the Grunge period, there were lots and lots and lots of books and authors and priggishness and sophistication, and because I didn't have anything better to do with my life I paid $xxxxxx to go to college to basically read books, only to graduate and have to cobble together a marketable skill on the fly in order to buy more novels and aerobics tapes.  But one thing remained from those early days.  The fascination with history, and the feeling that if I could read enough, something just right, I would get it and feel like I was there. I would transport myself entirely until I could smell it.  God, school had a way of wringing the life out of history. And to me, history is life -- daily life -- social history. My main interest. Because you can talk about the cotton gin and&nbsp;Roman centurions and the Battle of Hastings and courtly love and the fields of Flanders and the jungles of Vietnam all you like, but the fact remains that there were people there. It was what people were doing at the time. It was when the personal intersects with the political, the historical, the moment.   I wanted to know about the people.  I have to say, by the way, that I never personally felt touched by history until September 11th, and I think a lot of people my age this generation feel the same -- unless, like some of the other bloggers, they actually fought in a prior war. I remember that day -- I trade in anxiety in spades, and that day, down for a day at the beach with A, arriving just in time to see the second tower fall -- that day, no one could tell me everything would be safe ever again. No one still can. But&nbsp; I think we've all gotten used to living with that fact.  So&nbsp;goes history and its confluence.  But that's for another post sometime.   Back to romance novels and history. School was a place where you could memorize every fact -- the Intolerable Acts were blah blah blah, the Quartering Act was blah blah blah. What did it impact? And where was the love?  That answer is in romance novels.  A historical romance, simply put, is a story of a man and woman in love against the conflict of history. Sometimes the history intersects to a great degree, other times it just sort of sits there and smolders. You watch history unfolded between kisses and endearments. You try to put yourself in the place a woman at that time (they're always brave, they're often counter-culture) and wonder if you'd do the same thing, or just keep plodding on in your thirty-pound corset and tow the party line.  I don't know how I became such a hopeless romantic. I guess because I've sat in endless fiction clinics, classes and symposia, and always they want THE PAIN. You're not really writing unless your dog's getting run over. I call it the Shadow Dog effect, and I take it from a short story that a classmate wrote in a graduate class I took.  I really liked this professor, and he really liked me, though he wasn't too shy to say that "the mistakes Justrose makes in fiction she makes in a big way." That semester, because I thought it would more closely match the kind of things he liked to read, I did a series of Cop Stories based on my dad's -- and my brothers', as all four are police officers -- experiences on the mean streets.   He really liked the stories. I told them in a spare, impressionistic way, as is the fashion required in many fiction classes. They went over well in seminar critique and in my grade, which was an A-.  This professor was famous for only giving one A, and that went to the guy with the shadow dog effect down. Let's call the writer D -- D did a story of a young kid going to a prostitute with his dad for the first time, and all while they were driving to the bordello a shadowy dog was running alongside the car.  D got the A.  I could no more invoke a shadowy dog than I could kneel at this moment and eat a bowl of Kibbles 'n' Bits. It's just not my way. The impressionistic Cop Stories were a big enough stretch. Because my heart was elsewhere.   I didn't know it then, but part of it was locked up in the heliotrope prose of romances. I call them Happy Endings.  God, life is sad enough. Must you always be scraping up the ruins of your broken&nbsp;family at the end of a book in order for it be called Genius? When did reading cease to be entertainment, an escape from the drudgery and heartbreak of actual life?  My life, by the way, has in its darkest eddies the making of a massive Shadow Dog novel, but alas, for another time.  So romance.  Yes. I've written three. Has any of them seen the light of publication? Negatory. Why? Because (and I believe this) like everything else, the market is tight -- or so they say, they dangle a carrot by saying "we're always looking for good writing," but that's crap, they're looking for good money&nbsp;-- &nbsp;and they can make more off some dusty thing that one of the Goddesses of Already Published Romance wrote in 1982, by reprinting it, than they can by publishing my quite poetic and workmanlike efforts on behalf of the industry, as a callow unknown.  Also, romance changes its interest; there's a lot of suspense out there now, a lot of Regency, and that is just not to my taste. My three novels are about the Philadelphia Campaign of the American Revolution, about Gettysburg, and about the Bushwhackers of Missouri, with a fictionalized Jesse James trying to figure out post-war where it all went bad and save his sorry hide from hell, and the powers that be&nbsp;(so they say) claim there is not much of a market for that.  Am I some dumb broad just saying, "morning, 1778. I got up and ate my egg. My foot caught on the hem of my gown. Blah blah." Hell, no. There are entire  industries  around this stuff now (since a rumor got around that it was a penetrable -- no pun intended -- market, and everyone said, "Oh, I read them by the bushel! Of course I can  write  one!"  :::game show buzzer:::: Thank you, please try again.  Which makes it harder for those of us who are actually writers. Or consider ourselves to be so.  The point is that I researched the bejesus out of all these time periods -- and really got into it. That was the best part about writing these books. I could tell you what a lieutenant's uniform in the 1st Pennsylvania Regiment (formed in Lancaster County) looks like down to the final regimental braid. I could tell you what the Garrison at Richmond looked like, and what people ate for dinner. I could tell you why Jesse James became a bankrobber and what his religious beliefs were.  Not quite as simple as just ripping a bodice, and breathing a racy word into a piquant ear, is it?  So, if you've read this far without snoring, you want to know about the sex. Everyone does.  Believe it or not, and if you've read one you know -- there are rules to this stuff. It all goes in a certain order, blah blah blah. I won't bore you with the sterile details. But I've taken classes on how to do it.  Two of the novels I've written are Christian. There is no sex, but there is a suggestion of longing and intimacy -- and perhaps a kiss after engagement -- "Something," one editor told me, "that wouldn't make your grandma blush." Think  Ethan Frome , with his face in Mattie's knitting wool. The suggestion,&nbsp;and whether or not you're willing to admit to yourself what the suggestion is suggesting --&nbsp;can be way hotter than a play-by-play of the act in all its blue-tinted glory.  My Revolutionary novel contains sex. And so everyone wants to read it -- only they don't want to read through my heroic efforts about the Battle of the Brandywine, they just want straight to the petticoats. A Monty Python skit suggests itself.  No discussion of this topic would be complete without the Fabio factor. I do not find Fabio attractive, let it be known, nor do I feel that leonine frosted hair is appropriate coiffure of time periods from Viking to present.  But that's not the point.  The point of reading romance -- and writing it, in fact -- is that slow buildup. The men reading this might not understand, but the women will.   Love and history. That's what it's all about, boys.  Oh, and now -- the covers are much more chaste. You have to make up the clouds in your head, but frankly, that's a lot more fun.

      It hasn't gotten quite that bad, but the exchequer at the Anonymous Rowhouse is quite . . . shall we say, limited.   There is that episode of  The Simpsons  where they end up at the 25 cents store and Homer buys all that canned plankton and eats it . . . this is what I fear at times.   That, and that I will actually consider Potted Meat Product as an edible protein source.   I judge our fiscal health by what brand of paper towels I buy. Feelin' flush, and it's Spongebob print select-a-size Bounty all the way, baby.   Currently in the undersink cabinet there is 3-for-$1.99, rock-hard, composited ground glass rolls of Generic Special brand.   I don't even use paper towels to dry my hands -- I wipe them on whatever I'm wearing on the lower half of my body. But there is some comfort in these small sensualities when you're stuck in a rowhouse all day -- the Quicker Picker Upper beats all.   Alas, this is a generic time of month. We went  en famille  grocery shopping, to the cheap supermarket near P's school. My thriftiness startles even me at times, but I can swing wildly the other way into flights of spendthriftiness. I'm financially schizophrenic.   S's recollection of his childhood was an entire pantry of white boxes with black and red stripes on them, only distinguished by the bland labeling of their contents: MACARONI AND CHEESE. FROSTED FLAKES. ORANGE FLAVORED CHILDRENS' BEVERAGE.   Thoroughly traumatized by these memories, he doesn't really care what I buy (and just to illustrate the point about my unpredictability, when I was at Happenstance's Naturalistic Emporium buying P's dairy-free yogurt yesterday, I splurged four bucks on a teeny bottle of pomegranate juice -- I convinced myself at that moment it would prevent me from getting cancer sometime in the future). But, it depends on how much money we have -- what I buy, ultimately.    A Tree Grows in Brooklyn  was the first "long" book I read in my life, when I was nine. Loved that. I remember when little&nbsp;destitute&nbsp;Francie goes to buy tongue (ew!) for Saturday dinner, and how she has to bribe the butcher to give her extra, thus getting the most for her penny. Sometimes I feel that way when I go food shopping.

      Me: (heavy sigh)  S: What's wrong with you?  Me: I think I have PMS.  S: Well, take something!  Me: Take something? The only thing you can take for PMS is a cyanide capsule.  S: Take an anti-inflammatory. Me: The only thing inflaming me is how much cleaning has to get done and how I have to do it all. S: Well, duh, if I'm at work, I couldn't help -- Me: You wouldn't anyway. S: Because you do it all! Me: Let me ask you something. Do you ever wake up and think 'let me change the sheets?' Or do you just assume I'll do it? S: Yes. Me: To which thing? S: The second part. Me: (the laughter of the insane)

      So much cleaning awaits! Here at the Rowhouse we are expecting Serious Dinner Guests tomorrow, my aunt and uncle, delightful people but from a time when a certain standard of hygiene was revered.   Now I'm not saying the Rowhouse is a dump -- you know I spend my days June Cleavering away -- but it has that certain "lived in" look that would not do for a dinner party, i.e. the dining room table is covered with toys and the hutch is also covered with toys and the living room floor is covered with toys and the upstairs hallway is covered with toys, and the spare bedroom is devoted entirely to toys.&nbsp;   Also the bathroom needs to be cleaned and the sheets need changing.  The sheets bring up an interesting line of inquiry that has occurred to me over the course of my married life. S has never changed a sheet -- he's assisted me at times --&nbsp;but he has never woken up with the express thought:  Today the sheets must be changed.    What if I weren't here to do it? What would he do without me? He says "celebrate," but then he'd have to hire a housekeeper.

      Ode to Tylenol PM  Take but a single caplet dose or you'll spent the night with ghosts wide awake in your favorite chair watching B-actors with bad hair  I only took one Tylenol PM last night -- which I do occasionally when I can't get my brain to shut up -- and I slept okay and woke up feeling pretty decent until I went out front to water the Anonymous Rowhouse's small sun-fried container garden and to collect  The Michael Moore Digest , our local paper,&nbsp;and saw that in addition to the Urban Flight Panic of three adjacent houses being for sale, there is now ANOTHER house, this one  for rent , on&nbsp;the other side of Anonymous Rowhouse Road.   I don't know who lives in any of the houses now, to be fair. I just hope whoever moves in is quiet, discreet and practically invisible, or else we're screwed.  Four houses on one block is a lot of new neighbors to contemplate.  Before anyone goes on a tirade, just know that whenever you mortgage yourself from cellar to chimney pot to live somewhere decent, it is your hope that decent it will remain until you can cobble together enough cash to get somewhere more decent. Stability is built on just that -- stability, which means staying a while.   We lived in another Anonymous Rowhouse prior to this one, and that neighborhood went down, down, down. It all started out rosy and marginal, but liveable,&nbsp;and by the end I had con men coming to the door at&nbsp;eight o'clock&nbsp;Sunday morning telling me tall tales for ten bucks, and heroin-addict mamas approaching me at the gas station for a dollar because they "lost their bus fare." &nbsp;I hope this one isn't following suit, because we don't have the money to go elsewhere.   Not to diss realtors, but they're making money hand over fist destabilizing our neighborhoods. I feel like putting a sign on the Anonymous Rowhouse's tiny lawn saying NOT FOR SALE.   &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      This was actually in the  Inky  today. Do you believe there's an academic area known as Blue Collar Studies?   "The core value of the working class is being part of a like-minded group, such as a family, a union, or a neighborhoood."   "The core value of the middle class is achievement by the individual."   "In a working class home, a person says, 'I am what I am.'" (editor's note: were they taping every conversation I've ever had with my brothers? Speak into the lapel!)   "In a middle-class home, a person says, 'I have to do this (go to college, finish law school) to become what I will be.'" (editor's note: I went, but I still haven't become what I wanted to be).   This interested me:   "In traditional blue-collar households, experts say, parents raise their children in an authoritarian manner, stressing obedience over curiosity, and preaching conformity."   "Conversely, in many middle and upper class homes, children are solicited for their ideas and opinions, taught to speak up among adults and chauffered from one enriching activity to the next . . . It doesn't take long for them to develop a sense of entitlement, and a notion that their happiness matters."   Hmm. I think I was raised somewhere in between. Paging my therapist.

      A publisher had my manuscript for  a year and a half  and tonight I got back a big fat no. I feel a sort of lightness. I'm not disappointed.   What this means is that when I go to the Christian Writers Conference in two weeks I can be any kind of writer I want to be. I can choose to reshop my now TWO manuscripts with battle scars -- both historicals -- or do something else, or stop writing books altogether because it's a pain in the ass.   I've actually enjoyed writing  this  more than anything else in a long long time.&nbsp;Hell, at least people are actually  reading  it. I did a poem of my rejection slips that WAS published.&nbsp;Is that correct irony, Alanis fans out there? I never can keep it straight.   "If all poets killed themselves over a first rejection there would be no poetry at all." -- Sue Townsend,  The Adrian Mole Diaries   &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;

       urlLink    Keats  I don't know whithersoever this Keatsian annus mirabilis thing is coming from with all this writing and prolificness (I know it's not a word! I'm too lazy to look up what it really is). S working late: he said that God may return to earth before he gets home tonight. Which sucks, because there's a new ministry starting up at&nbsp;St. Around&nbsp;the Corner&nbsp;for mothers -- not just "mommy club" but REAL mom issues like special needs and infertility. I feel I can really benefit from it and perhaps add a word or ninety to the conversational thread.  &nbsp;  I really wanted to go, but this is life with a non-shift medical worker. I said to the coordinator, with whom I seem to have a lot in common (by e-mail at least), I thank God my husband has a good job but I really wish his late nights didn't fall on every night when I have something to do.  &nbsp;  Next time. I'm not a joiner -- there was some movie Renee Zellweger was in with Vincent D'Onofrio where he, portraying the writer of the Conan The Barbarian books, told her, "the road I walk I walk alone." That's pretty much been my experience, but I'm trying to stretch and grow into things that can support and nurture me, isolated soul that I am.  &nbsp;  So just baby and me tonight. Which is a relief, in a way -- S's presence adds such a bigness to the house, and sometimes things feel crisper and simpler without it -- I can give P soynut butter on crackers with a banana for dinner and no one will look askance. But as soon as she's in bed I'm missing him and worrying for him, and it messes with my sleep, sitting up for him until three in the morning sometimes.  &nbsp;  Just spent time with P in upstairs hall choosing stuffed animals for a grand plot she plans to hatch in the living room. We practiced her address, phone number, city, state and country. I don't remember anyone telling me this stuff but someone had to. I guess it was my longsuffering mother, God rest her soul. It's no wonder she went to an early grave with my brothers to raise.&nbsp;  More fun with Keats (courtesy my friend V, circa 1988): Keats and Yeats on rollerskates, skating through the wood. "Keats!" said Yeats. "Amazing feats! Your poetry is good!"

      Let's just call the vast residential tract that the anonymous rowhouse is in "the Hinterland." In response to the 'tour' post, my cousin, also from the Hinterland, sent me the following hilarious identification with the sad decorative legacy that is our lot:    And for the record, I have no Precious Moments, mauve ANYTHING, or countrygeese.&nbsp; Nor do I have any Blushing Bears, Snow Babies (little albino freaks), a cow costume for my vacuum cleaner, or those faceless dolls dressed like kids that stand in the corner.    &nbsp; More on the Hinterland later. It's a land ripe for analysis, because analysis is beyond it.

      P verified the source of the scream this morning was a dream about "a giant scorpion."  "You couldn't pet him," she said gravely. "He would sting you."  P loves bugs. She is a budding entomologist, so I asked her why the scorpion bothered her.  "He was a monster!" she asserted. "A great, BIG, purple monster!"  "P," I said, with that head tilt and dogged expression that I seemed to have mastered now that I am always unraveling her tall tales. "I thought you said he was a scorpion."  "But he was," she insisted. "A big purple scorpion monster! With a sting! You can't pet him."  As her companion in the car on the way to school (she's permitted to bring one toy per ride), she selected a hideous, oversized blue plastic cicada.

      P was dreaming about something and, in the great silence of 3:42 in the morning, let out a single,&nbsp;bloodcurdling scream.   She settled in a moment. She never woke up. This happens sometimes.   The effect it has on me is like a gallon of adrenaline ice-picking it way through my veins at a thousand miles an hour.   So she drifts back off peacefully while I lie there, with vomit at the base of my throat, heart pounding, hands shaking, guts roiling around like wet leaves in a drain.   It's true what they say when you're a mother that you never get a full night's sleep again. It starts when you're pregnant -- the baby doing flip-flop hiccups at two fifteen, then you're up, watching the Weather Channel and doing a crossword puzzle while eating Peanut Butter Cap'n Crunch.   Later on in pregnancy, you're just sleeping on the toilet because your bladder has a 5 cc capacity. Luckily in the first anonymous rowhouse we lived in, the sink console provided an adequate pillow.   And, of course, for however long you nurse and the baby needs them,&nbsp;you are at least semi-awake doing the overnight feedings.   I never saw dawn infiltrate the night so many times since I became a mother.   When P was about five weeks S and I were entirely run off our feet. She was very colicky -- understatement of the year -- and keeping us both running, all day, all the time. He was still working, of course. He could only take a few days off, and he took them right around her birth.   S got himself really sick -- he got an infection&nbsp;and no one knew what it was. He would swing a fever hard every night, from 105, shivered down to 97. He was in the back room sweating through the sheets. I was in the front room with the baby. All night -- feeding, putting her down, going and looking in on my semi-comatose man, back to the baby.   I figured out the the cause of the infection myself and got him treated and he got better. But that was a few days when I saw more hours of the night, fraught with more ice in my veins, than I care to remember.   It's early here at the anonymous rowhouse and the Philly summer sun is hanging askew in the haze, like a half-deflated balloon. I'm girding myself for the morning of Getting Ready for Preschool and wishing to God I had gotten some decent sleep last night. It's not always possible when you're looking out always for the ones you love most.

       urlLink     How cute! (not.)   All rowhouses in this enclave have essential equipment which this one sadly lacks. Softscaping that Mr. and Mrs. Verynice did before their departure is still in place (for lack of funds on our part), but my neighbors regard me with suspicion at times (my vocabulary? the extra-wide personal space that I insist upon maintaining? some odor that I cannot detect which swirls about me ominously?), and I'm sure it's because their surreptitious peeks within the windows of the rowhouse show a dearth of:  &nbsp;  PRECIOUS MOMENTS FIGURINES. How I loathe these hideous, Aryan, bobbleheaded little ceramic people who dare to stand beneath the eye of God and quote His word! Yet Mrs. Verynice had a whole display of them --&nbsp; she took the mini shelves from the alcove and left the holes -- and  I've seen them elsewhere on this block.     &nbsp;  SPORTS MEMORABILIA. If you've read my post on exercising, you can imagine how I feel about sports (apart from cliff diving and ice hockey -- occasionally). Besides, Philly teams&nbsp; always choke at the last minute -- everyone knows this, so the effort of caring&nbsp;is not worth the pathetic&nbsp;result.   LARGE FLUTED MAUVE VASES OF UGLY SCULPTURAL&nbsp; PHALLIC FAUX FLOWERS IN THE WINDOW. Essential. Yet eschewed by yours truly.   LITTLE UGLY GEESE ON COUNTRY PLAQUES HANGING ON THE DOOR. Okay, I've bowed a little to this one -- we have to keep property values up. There is a "let freedom ring" wreath on the door now, with an ugly doll on the wreath -- it was the best I could do.   POPCORN CEILINGS. It's not my fault! Mr. and Mrs Verynice had these done.   MAUVE RUGS. See above.   BIG WINDOW TREATMENTS, CUSTOM. Mr. and Mrs. Verynice left these behind in the bedroom -- only because they're attached to the wall.&nbsp;They are room-darkening so you can't see your hand in front of your face. Sometimes I pretend I'm in a sensory deprivation tank until I hear a ghetto stereo blaring in from outside. But Mrs. Verynice took everything else -- down to the last tack -- just like the Grinch did when he invaded Whoville at Christmas.   PLAID FURNITURE, BROWN. Mine, a floral formal with a complementary rose diamond wingchair in satin,&nbsp;strives to be sort of Williamsburg-living-room circa 1779, but I've got slipcovers over everything because Fatboy and P are destructomatic.   BIG WEDDING PHOTO, CUSTOM FRAMED. We couldn't afford a wedding album, so if you want to see a picture of the Hot Nuptials of 1991, you have to go digging.   LACQUER FURNITURE. I absolutely detest this -- put gold trim on it and I'm in my stepmother's living room circa 1986. I can't deal with the flashbacks, so I go for a good faux wood composite myself.   SERIOUS CONSOLE BED with MATCHING APPOINTMENTS.  Our bedroom: matress and boxspring on floor, assorted sheets. Bureau #1: S's grandparents, peeling veneer, circa 1930 Bureau #2: Sis-in-law's parents, light brown modern, circa 1960 Bureau #3: see #1 Wardrobe #1: see #2 Wardrobe #2 (door missing): Garage of Anonymous Rowhouse, rejected by Mrs. Verynice  Something we have in the anonymous rowhouse that I did not see in any of the houses we toured with a view toward purchase: BOOKS.   &nbsp;

      Went to see former college roommate to go to public pool in Planned Community. To say it's up the road a piece is putting it kindly. It's up the road, all right -- the road of the devil.  Oh, sure, there are calm sections, for example when it's one lane, 50 MPH, with a lonely cemetery on one side and train tracks on the other. But it's a big industrial access road at times, right off all the major highways, including 95. And so there is a panoply of assorted traffic -- what isn't a tractor trailer with a load of Extremely Heavy Stuff under a Hopefully Well Secured Tarp, is a piece of shit pickup towing a piece of shit boat, or some idiot teenager on the phone in her daddy's Beamer.  I don't like the following things about driving: -big trucks -on ramps -high speeds -people simultaneously eating, drinking, smoking and talking on the phone in the car behind me (usually a tiny, sunglasses-wearing lady&nbsp;in an SUV) -kids and itinerant men on bicycles, riding against traffic and wobbling into the lane  I had to pass the same frightening Giant Truck with Tarp twice. How I breathed a sigh of relief when he got on 95, only to be cut off when my lane ended by a phone-talking, sunglasses-wearing teenager!  I drive a car, just a plain old 95 mitsubishi that we bought from my nephew when he shipped out of the country (he's a Marine). A little, teeny car, foreign at that, made of light aluminum that would accordion in a 2-mph impact with an F-150. I realize my limitations.  I was wearing my miraculous medal so we made it home in one piece.  The pool was okay. The people watching was sublime, but former college roommate and I ended up doing a bit of policing for the kiddie pool, since everyone else's parents clearly were elsewhere. We sat on the edge. I was forced to go under the giant spraying mushroom with P, tasting that nasty little-kid, salty, questionably chlorinated water. UGH. P got on a kick where she was putting things in her mouth willy nilly, and we had to repair to the towel area to have a talk about how people with food allergies do not lick and taste every last thing they pick up in the world, unless they feel like going to the hospital. The word "hospital" was effective: she stopped doing it. She's never anaphylaxed yet, and as long as I draw breath I'll try to ensure she doesn't. But we can't go ignoring the risks in public.  There was great satisfaction in sitting by the pool and being what I am, unlike some people we observed there. There is no reason whatsoever to fake-tan yourself&nbsp; to the shade of a ginger snap, and I wish some people realized this. P, however, was the palest child in the pool -- she doesn't tan, and nor does S -- and she resembled a plain marshmallow in a sea of toasted ones.

       urlLink    Who am I?  Once upon a time there was a dog in the anonymous rowhouse.  And today I can smell him.  He wasn't my dog; he belonged to Mr. and Mrs. Verynice, who kindly sold us the anonymous rowhouse for over asking price.  It's been humid in Philly interspersed with days of flooding rain, and so whatever smell was in your rugs -- ever -- is now blooming forth as a fragrance to delight the senses.  Yuck.  Let's get this straight: I love all animals. Volunteer for a shelter, in fact, yes indeedy, as you all know, but it is&nbsp;a  cat  shelter.   Please don't blame my cats for the  odeur . Cats don't smell like anything. Well, they do; but in keeping with the way cats are, the fragrance is very subtle, and you literally have to put your face deep into their fur (I'm allergic; I get a faceful of hives for doing this) and take a slight whiff.  All of my cats have had different personal body odors, and as you know only two felines currently live in the anonymous rowhouse. The others, alas, have gone on to their earthly reward. (What would&nbsp;that be for cats? Sardines served on their master's pillow, with a dog standing by, fanning them? Or a really good chase of a mouse, one that they could catch?)  My beloved Special Puppet (not his real name!) smelled like a frenchfry. Yes, very sweaty and salty. I never got hives from him, I could smooch him all day with nary a twinge. But I was reminded of him yesterday. S bought a variety of canned food for our current Fatboy and when I opened it yesterday and smelled aura of Special Puppet I nearly lost it right there in the kitchen.  If you want to know how much I loved Special Puppet look up "completely&nbsp;codependent relationships between humans and animals" and you will see a picture of me there with him. I'm hugging him. He's squinting with a triumphant look.  I raised Special Puppet from the time he was so small that he could've fit into an aquarium. Some genius thought it would be a great idea to dump a motherless kitten in the woods, and by certain channels he found a way to A's old job at the vet's, and she showed him to me and said, "He hasn't grown since he's been here."  I took him home for the weekend, which was actually seven years long.  Special Puppet had a lot of health problems -- that's putting it lightly. S used to call him "the down payment."   Special Puppet was so tuned into me that he started acting really weird at the end of my pregnancy, even peeing on my leg once while I was sitting on the toilet&nbsp;in the middle of the night. (That's cat for "mine!")  I really think the day he died was the worst one of my life. S very compassionately did the deed, taking him to the vet that last time, and Special Puppet -- in terminal renal failure, brought on by a life of congenital heart and allergic disease -- meowed a little when he got into the cage, which -- well, broke my heart really just begins to describe what it did to me.  The baby was little then, maybe 16 or 17 months. It was two weeks after September 11th, so you couldn't really cry over a cat too hard. I started vacuuming for something to do -- and at about the moment that Special Puppet would've gone over to the other side, I calmly turned off the vacuum, lay on the dining room floor, and cried and cried until nothing I had ever smiled about before could wash it away.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      I hate working out. Hate it. I mean, I like it when you get into the workout after about twenty minutes, and the endorphins or whatever start pumping, and you think, this is great, I should do this more often, why do I always avoid this?  &nbsp;  Reasons I Avoid  1. I hate sweating, because when I sweat I must shower. If I delay my shower to work out, the phone rings fifteen times, both of the cats throw up, and P spills chocolate soymilk all over the coffee table. So I never end up working out in the end. I just stink.  &nbsp;  2. I always worry that my heart will burst.  This has been a problem my whole life. Those presidential fitness tests when we were in school? Heinous. Dreaded by me. Could not do the bent arm hang, long jump, curl ups, 600 yard dash. Feigned cramping, tropical fevers, existential angst to escape all of them. "Bumped" a volleyball one time on my forearms and got bruises. Would let everyone go before me in the rotation line. Was mocked during kickball, pegged hard by the meanest boys (who I am certain amounted to nothing in life, and knew they wouldn't even then on some level, which is why they preyed on the innocent) during dodgeball, and picked last for most teams as if I were the worst sort of garbage.  &nbsp;  3. My brothers were the athletes in the family, and I was the&nbsp;moody&nbsp;poet/bookworm.  &nbsp;  4. I am insanely active&nbsp;anyway -- my pulmonologist told me this today.&nbsp; My blood oxygenation was 98%; he said I could "sell oxygen to others." I climb more stairs in a day -- I actually did a step count one time, and I walked three MILES in my house. In one day. Granted, all days aren't like this -- I have a writer's butt -- but mothers should be given special dispensation for natural activity. Hoisting, hauling, dragging and urging on the business of life through sheer force of will must count for something beyond those stupid tables that tell you that plucking clovers for fifteen minutes burns 16.5 calories.  &nbsp;  5. I despise dieting. And I have done many.  Every diet&nbsp;says the same thing: NOT a diet! No food restrictions! Then you open the pamphlet, or click the link, or whatever and there it is . . . the turkey wrap with the cilantro pesto topping, all of which you have to shop for, pay for,&nbsp;put away and store, chop, grind, mix and whirl, only to eat 1 oz. of per week since that's all that's allowed, letting the rest go to waste.  &nbsp;  It takes so much time to do that stupid cooking and prep that you burn the measly 128 calories/2&nbsp;g fat that are in the sandwich.  &nbsp;  Also all of the diets are nut and egg crazy. Scrambled egg this and peanut butter that. P has anaphylactic allergies to nuts and eggs, so we don't have them in the house. The only reliable substitutes I've found for them are twinkies and Coke.  &nbsp;  SO, I&nbsp;drag myself through the workouts. I look at the ads that say BEFORE (drab, black and white photo, with greasy hair and a prison-cell grimace, wearing your dead granddad's flannel shirt circa 1952 and stretch pants sans the stretch) and AFTER (svelte, skintight red sheath, four color pizzazz, with professional makeup and two-hour hair) and try to pump the type that says RESULTS NOT TYPICAL to 24 points.  &nbsp;  Who is&nbsp;writing this? Do I weigh more than, say, a full room service cart? Or am I built like the Maxfield Parrish painting that represents justrose, my blogging persona? No and no again.&nbsp; Have you seen that commercial where the old ladies are leapfrogging to "Born Free" because that&nbsp;jarred spaghetti sauce with the meat in it &nbsp;has gotten them out of the kitchen?  &nbsp;  I may look like that in thirty years: my genes dictate that it will be so, but that's okay. I like housecoats. In the meantime, my ethnic heritage means that I'm built rather like Sophia Loren. But on the twinkie diet.

      Everything you WANT to do never gets done, while everything you don't want to do takes all your time.  &nbsp;  The dishwasher, for instance, may as well be my bed, my desk&nbsp;and my place of worship for all the time I spend tending it. I never cook, apart from P's weird allergy food, and I mainly live on cookies and cheezits, so how it requires constant maintenance I have no idea.  &nbsp;  I have been trying to get back to a book I started (which is now lost, swept away in the sea of action figures and coloring books) for a week. Granted, THIS has taken time, but I type fast and, these are all thoughts I'm walking around thinking all the time anyway. And the blog frankly is the one bright spot&nbsp;of the moment in an otherwise vacationless existence, stuck in the city for the whole summer while tanned neighbors come and go from relatives' shore places.  &nbsp; Yes, I did go to&nbsp;Atlantic City with my college roommate for one night a couple of weeks ago. I gambled ten dollars on the slots and won it back and bought something for P that cost ten dollars. I&nbsp;gave K my last five for tolls. The highlight was a rickshaw ride down the packed -- packed! was there another person on earth that weekend that WASN'T in Atlantic City? -- boardwalk propelled by a comely Slovakian named Michael. &nbsp;  I have driven to the ends of the earth lately, if each end is located here in Philly and you just crisscross it eight billion times in a week. I knew I was going off the deep end this afternoon, driving home after picking up P from A's house, who kindly watched her during a doctor's appointment.  &nbsp;  I found myself rocking out to the kids' tape version of "Oh, Susanna" and wishing I had a pair of spoons to slap against my thigh.  &nbsp;  Things couldn't go much lower.

      I swore I'd never turn into my mother, but I'm getting very close to needing to dye my hair -- and I never had a single gray hair before I had a child. My mother used to point to her gray hairs and say: "These are all from you."&nbsp; Of course, I figured she was lying. She said other things, and when they leap out&nbsp;of my mouth they surprise the bejesus out of me:  &nbsp;  1. Eat! Eat. Eat your food. Finish your dinner. Eat. Eat. Eat.  &nbsp;  2. Put your shirt down!  &nbsp;  3. Pull your pants up!  &nbsp;  4. It's rude to stare.  &nbsp;  5. The word "penis" isn't funny; don't say it out loud at school.  &nbsp;  6. Quit laughing.  &nbsp;  7. Wipe that smirk off your face.  &nbsp;  8. Wait until your father gets home!  &nbsp;  9. Oh, God, what did I do to deserve this?  &nbsp;  10. Jesus, Mary and the carpenter.  &nbsp;  11. I wish I could've held you as a baby but then that I could send you to special camp and they would just send me a picture of you once a year and tell me you were doing fine.  &nbsp;  12. Can I PLEASE have some time to myself?  &nbsp;  13. The world doesn't revolve around you.  &nbsp;  14. If you don't get in bed this second . . .!  &nbsp;  15. The cat is not a toy.  &nbsp;  16. Don't run with scissors. . . .!  &nbsp;  And, of course, the pinched-mouth angry face that used to stop&nbsp; me in my tracks. Now the kids are way too sophisticated for that; they keep on doing it anyway. Whatever  it  is.

      A continuation of this morning's conversation.  &nbsp;  S: So what SHOULD we do for our anniversary? We've got to do something.  Me: I thought we should go to favorite restaurant with A and P. It's her birthday too.  S: How is that  our  anniversary?  Me: We don't actually TALK when we go out to dinner. You eat in silence.  S: We talk!  Me: We don't.  S: We do!  Me: About what?  S: (muttering, putting away socks)  &nbsp;  When I was fifteen I went out and visited S with his parents in Toledo. At breakfast with his mom and dad, I noticed they were each reading separate magazines. The other one could've been on fire for all one of them knew or cared, so engrossed were they. I thought, at the time, with schoolgirlish certitude,&nbsp;" if I marry S we'll never run out of things to talk about !"  &nbsp;  Fast forward eighteen years. Breakfast. Me, reading  People  magazine; him,  Science News , both spooning down our respective cocoa pebbles.  &nbsp;  I stayed at a monastery once, and the meals with the monks during the great silence were beyond belief. The sound of communal chewing unmitigated by the spoken word&nbsp;is not an appetizing one. It undermined the lofty communion that was supposed to be taking place.  &nbsp;  There's a reason why it's called dinner conversation.  &nbsp;

      4:43 PM. This is the time of day when stay-at-home moms can get really lonely, if they've little ones that still aren't in school full-time. Precious, tuckered out from whatever range of activities you've supplied throughout the day, becomes by turns either a TV zombie or a wheedling little nag at your elbow.  &nbsp;  Dinner is a distant possibility, but when you have a husband in S's line of work he could walk in the door at 5:30, or possibly six, or possibly midnight or later, and he never knows beforehand. I don't really like to cook anyway -- I prefer to assemble an assortment of precooked or semicooked food -- and with P's raucous food allergies I have to make two meals most of the time anyway, though there is some overlap between what we eat and what she eats (if you like rice).  &nbsp;  Bedtime is hours away, but it's too early to start putting away the plastic dinosaurs and magic markers, because she'll just pull them out again. Story and craft time could happen now, but, again, effort is required on my part.  &nbsp;  I know I sound like the princess and the pea. But there are things about this life that there is no roadmap for in the modern day. Everyone thinks they know what housewives do -- eat bonbons and watch soap operas -- but I have never watched a soap opera (though I sometimes watch five minutes of "Who's the Babydaddy" on Maury Povich or whatever during lunch because the kitchen TV only tunes in local channels, and I get disgusted that the men are so THRILLED that they're not the father, and they strut around going, "Yeah! Bitch! Yeah!" all exonerated -- when if they had any shred of honor at all, they would be glad to love someone else's baby if they  truly  loved her mother. How could those people have even had intimate relations in the first place? It boggles. Those kinds of people make me love my life, and the man I married even more. I have to turn those programs off as fast as I can most of the time.)  &nbsp;  And while I do snack, I do not know what constitutes and have not ever eaten a bon bon.  &nbsp;  If you work in an office you know that wind down time of day? This is a little of what this is like, but it never ends for stay-at-home types. There is no change of scene. Every day is the same, every night is the same, with brief interludes of terror and joy. I guess the workaday life is like that too sometimes, but I did a lot of purchasing in my jobs, so there was an aspect of business lunching that broke up the monotony of the day.  &nbsp;  My dad took me and some friends to the ballet and his friend had seen  Swan Lake  before -- performed more traditionally -- and she discussed the finer and lesser points of the performance. In contrast to my former culture vulture self, I simply said that anything&nbsp; that wasn't  Spongebob Squarepants ,  Scooby Do  or  Sesame Street  was like heaven to me. Simply being out on a week&nbsp;night&nbsp;among adults wearing jewelry and clothes that weren't encrusted with soy yogurt was Nirvana itself, when one is used to only escaping for things like grocery shopping and root canal treatment.  &nbsp;  BUT, of course, in that particular instance it was the first time I'd been to a concert in about five years -- and some rocket scientist in front of us&nbsp;thought it would be a great idea to bring a six-year-old to an eight PM curtain, and she fidgeted and held the rail and twirled and shifted through the first three acts, proving that you can never escape parenthood entirely, even when your own children are at home in bed.  &nbsp;  I remember leaving the working world when P was a baby (not completely by choice, but that is for another entry) and walking around with my eyes narrowed during the days, looking at all the other diurnal denizens and wondering (as I did in my teens at things like Yes concerts) "where do they come from, where do they go." Then I gradually became one of them. One time in an elevator at JC Penney when Pwas four months old or something another mom said to me, "Clifford is coming to the children's department!"  &nbsp;  "Who?" I asked.  &nbsp;  "Clifford!" She was smiling. "The big red dog!"  &nbsp;  "Maybe I should go up to the third floor instead . . ." I hedged.  &nbsp;  "Don't you think it would be fun for your daughter?"  &nbsp;  I so wasn't cut out for it. It's taken me four years to approach a costumed mascot with even a modicum of goodwill.

      As S was leaving for work this morning at Urban General, where he works in the operating room, we had the following conversation: &nbsp; Me: Tomorrow is our anniversary. Him: (noncommittal grunt) Me: Did you hear me? Him: (rustling through bag) Which one is it? Eleven? Me: Thirteen. Him: How in God's name did that happen?

      Midsummer, and a young woman's fancy lightly turns to thoughts of matrimony.  &nbsp;  Tomorrow is my THIRTEENTH wedding anniversary. Yes, to the same man. I'm only thirty three. I was a child bride.  &nbsp;  Circumstances dictated that it must be so. We were both finishing college, he was headed to Pittsburgh of all the godforsaken places on the earth, and I wanted to go with him. My dad wouldn't ante up the cost of the wedding if we lived together first, and while at the time I thought that harsh and rather conservative of him, I was glad later because it was such a horrific first year of depression and destitution I would surely have moved home again without that piece of sacred paper holding us however tenuously together. Chances are I wouldn't be here now writing this with my name still next to his on the tax return, with his baby sleeping upstairs.  &nbsp;  God, Pittsburgh was a hole. Not for nothing is it called Pittsburgh. But more on that in some other post.  &nbsp;  We dated from eleventh grade, three months after my mom died. He was a year ahead of me in school, and when he graduated, his parents moved to Toledo, Ohio, of all the godforsaken places on the earth. They still live there, and their visits are filled with surprise and wonder (read irony).  &nbsp;  He went to University of Lake Effect Snow, and I was still in highschool, and at fifteen was unready and/or unwilling for a long distance relationship. So he transferred back to University of Urbanization while I graduated and went on&nbsp;to Former Girls College of the Suburbs. He came to visit on the train once a week, and then,&nbsp;of course, we did the year in the&nbsp;British University of the Northern Sheepfields.  &nbsp;  So, the final year came (he was in his fifth year owing to the study abroad) and it seemed a good time to make a decision, so we did. To fish or cut bait, as it were. After all that time, our engagement was only ten weeks long.  &nbsp;  The engagement itself wasn't corny and contrived but took place in the duplex half of an anonymous rowhouse similar to this one, except that one had a brown-and-burnt orange swirly shag rug. I was sitting on that rug, looking at a catalog of diamonds with a sore throat that I thought was going to kill me, when he asked.   I laughed at him but said yes. I knew it was coming. I supplied my own diamond, from my mom's ring.  &nbsp;  The wedding preparations were a nightmare. Really all a girl wants at such a time is her mommy, and you know I don't have one of those. But I had my dad's now-ex-wife, who ascribed to the "Disney" stepmother model. The week before the wedding was so tense that I used to borrow my dad's car, the LeBehemoth, in the days when I couldn't bear to drive, and drive to S's apartment where I would fall into his arms and sob as soon as he opened the door. I laugh to think of the drama now -- my 20-year-old self wouldn't last a day in my present life. Anyway,&nbsp;stepmom's expert floral arrangements looked lovely at the house when the 85 guests showed up on the hottest day on record. 100 degrees, 100 percent humidity, outdoor reception.  &nbsp;  It was subdued to say the least. Other people were wringing out their shirts, but my dad never took his tuxedo jacket off. I don't know how the man didn't succumb. Pictures of my brothers show pit stains the size of turkey platters. All the old people had to be herded into the only room with a window AC unit, since the central air broke on that day. The caterers spilled a mondo urn of coffee on the pale peach rug in the dining room -- the same rug which had spelled curtains for my beloved cat several years before, as my stepmother would cry after work with her little carpet machine, cleaning up the kitty's spite pee. It could only be described as karmic, in my opinion.  &nbsp;  During my Intellectual Phase I actually thought I would go to grad school eventually and become an Instructor of Poetry, which is&nbsp;a joke because only one person in the country has that as a full-time job. But&nbsp;since&nbsp;I&nbsp;later worked on the administration side of higher ed for 10 years I know that those rejections came for a reason. I wouldn't have been able to take it for a single semester.  &nbsp;  But back to the wedding. Apart from the oppressive heat, it was very garden party and I thought delightful. The service was short (we used traditional vows; my father in law the ultraliberal chaplain married us in the Presbyterian fashion, with an Episcopal priest there for ballast), the food was good, and the guests were gracious and generous.  &nbsp;  My father in law asked why I didn't write my own&nbsp;vows. I HATE self-written vows. Why mess with success? The dearly beloved ones were written hundreds of years ago, I imagine. They are way better than:  &nbsp;   BRIDE:  You are my savior, my soul, my heart, my joy! I promise to clean up the empty milk carton you left on the coffee table for a week, if you promise to pay for my anti-cellulite spa treatments!    GROOM:  I will never say another sentimental thing to you until after we are divorced, but since you plan to sleep with me tonight, I'll tell you how beautiful you are to me at this moment!  &nbsp;  I will never forget two things: how S looked at me as I sailed down the aisle in my off-the-shoulder meringue, greeting long-lost friends as I went, and how my dad cried as he handed me over. It was authentic even though he later told S, "No refunds! No exchanges! She's all yours!"  &nbsp;  As far as the traditional vows went, I thought they were a tall order at the time. Can I mean all this? I wondered. And I realized that those vows are something that you grow into meaning, that you work toward, every day, with varying levels of success. But I still mean them. And I'm glad I did this before I had time to question and idealize the institution too much, because figuring it out as you go along is part of the fun.  &nbsp;  Bring the wedding up to anyone who was there, even now,&nbsp;and they all say the same thing: "Yeah, I remember your wedding.  God damn it, it was hot! "  &nbsp;

      Best friend A says, "You can always tell what year in college people are in by the things they quote." She cites  The Unbearable Lightness of Being  as a prime example. That's senior year, modern world literature. &nbsp; The truth is while reading around blogs I see a plethora of quotations from Nietzsche and other great thinkers. Whereas this blog appears to be written by someone who has never seen the dry side of a dishcloth. But I have news for you. &nbsp; I was an intellectual once. Truly. This was in 1991, during the first Gulf War. While many of the people now quoting Nietzsche were still playing with their My Little Ponys. The fact is, once you've hit thirty and discovered motherhood, Nietzsche no longer applies -- though he  should , especially when you're scrubbing shit out of a pair of toddler underwear and wondering about the exact moment when you made the choice&nbsp;that brought you down this particular road. &nbsp; Oh, those days -- the luxury of thought! How I quoted and cited during colloquia! How I drew comparisons between Darwinism and the economic unrest of the 19th century! My Lawrentian period (that's something every self-respecting English major goes through, and that's D.H. Lawrence, 1885-1930, one of the finest modernists and the first writer in English to actually portray relationships between men and women in naked detail) lasted forever. I even have the first edition of  The Rainbow  and read all three versions of  Lady Chatterley's Lover.   &nbsp; Where are those books now? In the garage. Those too boring to make the cut were donated to a Catholic charity, to make room for my daughter's burgeoning collection of My Little Ponys.  It is hard to reconcile being a Thinking Person with being a parent because parenthood is like Chinese water torture -- drip, drip, drip. It wears you down to the bone, to the point where, at five pm and hungry,&nbsp;you waste a lot of words trying to ask for basic things. Example: &nbsp; -Would you like something to eat? -Yes. -What can I make you? -How about those orangey things that come in the red and white can? You know, the salty ones. -You mean baked beans? -Yeah. That's what they're called. &nbsp; Reading about cataclysm and trials by fire is one thing. Let me tell you, Man's Search for Meaning went out the door for me in the delivery room when they told me it was time to push and an hour and forty five minutes later, having used every muscle in my body including my hair follicles, I finally held the person who was to dictate my fate from that moment on in my arms. &nbsp; No one wants to talk about Kafka at the playground. &nbsp; &nbsp;

      S has taken P to the petstore and the mall. AHHHHHHHHH . . . silencio.&nbsp; Just the airconditioner whirring upstairs, the fan on the computer, and time stretching out before me while I decide what to do with it.&nbsp; After I finish this I will go up and clean, which is what I always end up doing with&nbsp;it, while my novels remain unread and unwritten. &nbsp;  It occured to me that maybe people think I don't like hanging around with my daughter. Far from it: I love it more than anything. But just like you can't eat gallon after gallon of vanilla ice cream with butterscotch topping, so you cannot spend every waking moment in the company of a winsome four-year-old.  &nbsp;  For one thing I was never one of those people who gush, "I love kids! I love babies!" blah blah blah. I love  my  kid, obviously.&nbsp; I'm fond of others that I know.&nbsp;I'm just not wired in the "early childhood education" mode like so many others. And I can't stand "mommy clubs" and refused to be a part of that stuff.&nbsp;Some people really like the infant stage, but as our P had undiagnosed GERD and cried 24 hours a day and refused to nap unless you lay down with her or held her and then you couldn't move a muscle -- I used to turn&nbsp;pages of novels slowly, ever&nbsp;so carefully ---  shhhhht!  --&nbsp;so as not to disturb her&nbsp;-- I'd say I like&nbsp;the four-year-old stage better.  &nbsp;  When she left with S I picked her up and smothered her with kisses and told her I loved her, and she said "I love you, too! I'm sorry I said I didn't love you yesterday!" which is something that one begins to hear at this stage.  &nbsp;  An example:  -Please flush the toilet.  -No! I don't love you. I don't love you anymore!  -PLEASE. Do it now! -No! Go away!   &nbsp;  and so on. Just for the hell of it. It can be maddening.  &nbsp; Of course, I don't really give a damn if she flushes the toilet or not, I'll do it, but you get this BURDEN of trying to make them be members of society -- courteous, responsible -- so then you end up all the time trying to do this civics education in things like flushing the toilet. &nbsp;  In other news, yesterday, my $23 pair of Tweezerman "lifetime guarantee" (as my best friend was quick to point out) tweezers sailed down the toilet midflush. They fell out of the cabinet above the toilet.  &nbsp;  "I would've salvaged them," A said.  &nbsp;  There was no salvaging! They were DOWN the chute in a flash. The incident occurred midflush! I would've stuck my hand in there to get them back -- if it were possible.  &nbsp;  FOR YEARS I wouldn't allow myself a really GOOD pair of tweezers. It is so necessary once one enters one's thirties.  &nbsp;  "Buy a new pair next month," suggested S helpfully. This is the low-funds end of the month. He gets paid once a month and my earnings wouldn't put a plastic bride and groom on an anniversary cake.  &nbsp;  But what will my eyebrows do until then?  &nbsp;

      I haven't been to church in three weeks. My church service is at 8:15 and it's basically me and about 8 REALLY old ladies, so I bring the median age down to 65.2. On the second and fourth week, I'm the liturgist, which means I put on a really hot polyester robe with no wicking properties whatsoever, that has orange makeup smeared across the collar from the other liturgists, and a really long rope, it's like 20 feet long, that I try to fashion in some way with a boyscout knot so I won't trip. Then I march next to the minister up to front (sometimes alone if he's off) and lead all the prayers, readings and singing. Why do I do this? I don't know. I like it. It makes the service go faster. And somehow, since I was very little when I was an altar girl for the Episcopalians (I'm Lutheran now) I always manage to find myself up on the altar. &nbsp; I absolutely loathe public speaking but I'm pretty good at it. My dad gave me a trick to try, he said just panic for the first three words then let autopilot take over. Sometimes I deliver the liturgy in this real heartfelt way, and other weeks I recite it, and I don't think anyone notices the difference. The point is that it's not supposed to be you but the spirit of God coming through you. I figure if it's His show, then He can do the fine-tuning. &nbsp; I like going and so I should get ready to go, even though I'm not liturgist this week. I was supposed to have been last week but where was I? At brunch at the Borgata hotel in Atlantic City, eating eggs benedict with my former college roommate. I felt no remorse then; so why do I feel remorse  now?    &nbsp; My father in law is an ultraliberal presbyterian chaplain (which makes for interesting theological discussions with me, a quasiconservative semicatholic Lutheran who says the rosary). He says he doesn't think God knows or cares if you go to church or not. He said church is for people. Maybe he's right, because when I don't go,  I  know the difference.

      In a weak moment I bought P a tape of kids-singalong songs at the bookstore. Now my car is constantly filled with the sounds of summer camp. I usually listen to Christian radio in the car -- it keeps me from having road rage. However, on a good long drive like the cat rescue yesterday, I can be more soothingly propelled by death metal, S's choice. Anyway, when P is in the car she demands her tape of repackaged-Civil-War ditties with new words (i.e. "John Brown's body lies a-moldering in the grave" becomes "John Brown's Chevy has a puncture in its tire." I sing along with the old words.) So, if I had to roll down my window to pay toll or something, the cashier would hear a rollicking chorus in the round of:  &nbsp;   I love the mountains!  I love the rolling hills!  I love the flowers!  I love the daffodils!  I love the fireside, when all the lights are low  Boom de ada boom de ada boom de ada boom de ay   &nbsp;  and so on to infinity. The songs play forever in my head afterward.  &nbsp;  Today, going to a friend's mom's pool, we were listening to this tape and P all of a sudden said:  &nbsp;  -We going to visit YOUR grandmom?  -No, we're going to visit J and M's grandmom.  -My grandmom is your mommy?  -Yup.  - She go to the sky? (my mom died of cancer when I was 14.)  -Yup.  -When can we go visit  her?   &nbsp;  Oh baby. I felt an actual clench in my chest. "Not for a long time," I said.  &nbsp;  It really does come out of the mouths of babes.

      I have a friend . . . let's call her B. Anyway, she is a certified cat lady and she called me about these two cats that she had somehow "acquired" that needed a home. I've known her about a dozen years and every time she does this, I know she means for me to say, "Certainly I'll take them! I was in the market for a couple more cats." I didn't do this, though. Instead I called a shelter I volunteer for and asked  them  to take the cats. They reluctantly agreed. &nbsp; A date was set -- yesterday! -- that B and I would repair to the shelter which is NOT close to my house. Far from it, in fact -- it's about an hour away on a twisting country lane. When I called B to seal the deal, she denied knowing that she had agreed to accompany me, and so on, and so on, and ended up bawling that her life was fifty times worse than she let on, and to just forget it. Now losing face on both sides of the situation, I reluctantly agreed to take the cats by myself. And so it went that I dropped my daughter off at the babysitter, sheathed my back seat in a plastic matress cover, and picked up the cats. B will not allow me into her house -- I have NO IDEA why -- so she was waiting at the curb with two carriers and their occupants.  Turns out these cats were found in a box downtown. Since B is insane, the plot developed more and more holes as she talked on, but in general I gleaned that someone had taken them, gotten evicted, then someone ELSE had taken them, they were allergic to them, then B had them, then one of B's friends took them. In order to bring them to the curb where my car idled, the last "owner" had to bribe her pizza delivery man to drive them to Front and Girard, B took the El down there and transported them to Frankford Terminal, and someone ELSE picked her up there and drove her to her house. (Of the three cat ladies mentioned here I am the only one who drives). Then I drove them to the shelter in the country.  &nbsp; The cats, a tabby and a tortie, meowed the entire time, of course, but at least the meows were quiet and not heinous. I put on smooth jazz for them and kept driving. I would've preferred to rock out to some nice death metal, but it was not to be. &nbsp; &nbsp;Now one thing you must know about me is that I am a very reluctant driver. I don't HATE it -- I actually enjoy the physical act of it -- but it stresses me that everyone ELSE is insane. For example, on a narrow road I waited for some troglodyte to get into his truck in my lane, where he was parked, and the car in the opposing lane, annoyed at the lack of space between our vehicles, barked: "PAY ATTENTION TO ME NOT THE PERSON!" Oh, okay. To avoid scratching YOUR car, I'll hazard hitting him. You can't wait two seconds. What the hell is wrong with people? &nbsp; Anyway, I drove on. The tabby made a suspicious rustling in his bin and next thing I knew I smelled poop. Eye-wateringly vile. SO! Cursing vociferiously, I rolled down the window and tried as hard as I could not to pull over next to the farm I was driving past and just let them GO. I arrived at the shelter, shelter manager D took a look and despite B's assurances to the contrary, the tortie had ringworm!!!!!!! Just my luck. We flouresced it under the blacklight. &nbsp; "She'll have to be washed three times a week," D said. "Which is a pain in the butt." &nbsp; "I'm sorry -- I can take her back --" &nbsp; "No," she said. "I think you've removed these cats from a very bad situation." &nbsp; But what it cost! &nbsp; Anyway, dying of guilt that I saddled D with a sick cat, I drove home, calling B on my cellphone to tell her that the tortie had ringworm. &nbsp; "It only is accurate 50% of the time," B asserted. "That flourescing." &nbsp; Yeah, okay, 50% of the time if the cat has ringworm it might NOT flouresce. But if it flouresces -- and you have itching and hair loss, then you have got ringworm, my friend. &nbsp; Why is this a big deal? The heartbreak of ringworm? Well, chiefly because it's so contagious. Now, I don't care if I get it -- I really don't -- though I will say D kindly cleaned the cages before I left and I lysolled everything in my car -- including my skin. The tortie kindly rubbed against me with her nasty ears on my bare legs, fueling the fire. &nbsp; But mainly, it's because I don't want my daughter to get it; if she does, she can't go to school and we're eating beans to afford her preschool. So, I left her at the babysitter a little longer, dropped off the cages, and went home, where I made bleach water, scrubbed the interior of the car, stepped inside, stripped in front of the washer (including sneakers), washed everything, robed and went upstairs, where I took a very hot shower, and sanitized the tub afterward. &nbsp; When I picked up my daughter from S's house, I almost stepped in a squashed sparrow, adding to the overall vile and scatological character of the day. But I hope it gives those cats a happy ending.

      The earlier post was authored in a moment of reflection but now both S and P are up which means I am escaping here for one moment more. &nbsp; P is eating breakfast; S always knocks himself out to make a "nice breakfast" for P on weekends. He did her hypoallergenic pancakes and a ham steak. P is in a mouthy phase and always wants the last word.   An example: S: Stop talking back! P: No! I want to talk FRONT! &nbsp; P is four years old. You know, when you have a baby you make this rosy vision of turning back an afghan over a sleeping little angel. And yes, that does happen, around 9:30 every night. But the twelve hours in between can be heaven or hell -- depending on your (and her) mood. &nbsp; It is Saturday. Weekends are no longer a break for me unless I go out with friends, which I try to do for a few hours every weekend. S, of course, having worked like a dog all week, wants time to himself as well; but P, not having seen S except in dribs and drabs all week long, wants him all to herself, answering questions about which sea creature is which in her new book. Maintaining a Solid Relationship with S, as all women's magazines advise, does not even figure into the equation 92% of the time, as we scramble around in this netherworld of Being Good Parents.  &nbsp; NOTICE, everyone who loses 200 lbs., does a triathalon, hot-air-balloons around the world, or feeds all the homeless in town every weekend is NOT the parent of a small child or children -- or if they ARE, then they have a lot of help that we don't have.  &nbsp; "Being a parent is an insane undertaking," says my counselor. S and I were not parents (except to cats, who can be left home alone) for the first nine years of our marriage, so P's long-awaited and blessed advent, in a word, kicked our going-on-thirty asses. But we're getting better at it.

      I never told you how we found the Rowhouse, ultimately.  The first anonymous rowhouse, all 1,598 square feet of it, was located in a neighborhood that went entirely downhill. I knew this because I was home all day. When the baby was born, I used to stroll the neighborhood -- the same place where my grandmother had worn a coat with a fur collar and gone to high school, and where my parents had fallen in love. The neighborhood the first rowhouse was in goes all the way back to the 18th century, when it was ten miles from William Penn's Greene Country Towne, and boasted a flour mill that was worth the walk. Now it is the terminus of a transportation hub that sees the end of the El train and the beginning of about two dozen buses that go all across Rowhouseland, way up past the city lines. Still vital to travel  through , but not necessarily to live  in .  It was a blue collar neighborhood very similar to this one, and by the time the baby was nearly two years old I couldn't look outside and not see someone terrifying walking down the street. I started to look over my shoulder more if we were on walks. My church, which was and is still there, was a place where I used to blithely walk at night -- just two blocks from home; but now I drove, and I worried whenever I stood in the halls waiting for someone to open the interior doors.   S was at work, so he saw a slice of this when he got home, but mostly it was me. I thought I was being paranoid. But then some things changed. In 1996, when we moved there, you could tell any cop you met -- friends of my brothers', my brothers themselves, the intersection where we lived and they'd shrug and concede, "That ain't bad in 'ere." Meaning the neighborhood was okay to live in, car thefts mostly, nothing big.   By the time I floated the possibility of listing the house, they'd cringe and mutter, "That's gettin' bad in 'ere."  One of my brothers was more blunt. Every time he talked he said, "When are you gettin' the f--- out of 'ere? List your goddamned house."  "But S says there's too much to fix and we don't have the money --"  "Who cares what he says? You have a baby to raise. Can you even f----- play outside with her?  List it !"  First it was one brother. Then two. Then all three. Then my dad, who had sold me the first anonymous rowhouse, every time we spoke, saying, "Rosie, I want you to think seriously about maybe listing your house. Someone got shot a block away last night --"  A block away! One day when I was pregnant my  next door neighbor  was stabbed with a pair of scissors right in her hair salon by a client. She lived. Previous to that, an off-duty police officer trying to break up an altercation in a corner bar was shot by two thugs. He didn't.  It's amazing the power of protection your mind can muster when this happens. I thought, well, it was next door, not here. Or, that was all the way down the block. Not here. Never mind that I could see it from my window -- my house was safe. People had lived on the block for five decades. It would be fine.  You must understand that once I decided to/was forced to/realized the divine logic of staying home with the baby, our fiscal soundness took a massive hit. I still don't know how we're making it, but somehow, some way, we are. We live extremely modestly. Velveeta is a favorite food, as are baked beans and white bread. Our marriage has seen some particularly lean moments -- having thirty dollars to last us six weeks in Pittsburgh one January is a highlight of pernury that comes to mind. And the first rowhouse was a white elephant in the extreme.  My dad and brother had purchased it from a friend for a song, and gutted it and started over. When we moved in, it had new carpets and a fresh coat of paint and mostly new windows. The first rowhouse was on the end of a block, and it had twenty five windows. When there were thunderstorms, which I hate, I would feel like I were in an IMAX theater.   It was also expensive as hell to heat, the heater being next to an unfinished coal bin in the basement, as an addition to the house. A friend's husband came and repaired it once, and marveled at its vintage. "I've seen this kind before in books," he said, with the same appreciation that an automobile maker might have for a Model T, "but I never dreamed that I'd find one still operational."  It was woefully inefficient, though. The house cost a fortune to heat, but we never came across the grand we needed for the new heater.  There were two dozen things like that in the first rowhouse. It needed  so much  work. It was  so  big. The cats loved it -- my dad said they called it "The Ponderosa," because there was so much room to run. But at our peak we had five cats in there, and they systematically destroyed great tracts of the interior.   Luckily S is a handyman type -- there's nothing he can't do or figure out how to do. This is because he grew up in that same neighborhood, in yet another sprawling ramshackle house (though his was a twin, and interestingly the former home of a doctor that treated people in my family, so my dad could've ostensibly gotten his diphtheria toxin/antitoxin in the same little room where S and I used to watch TV and cuddle). And S's dad impressed little S into the endless scourge of Home Improvement, so that little S could be seen at six helping to pour concrete, at ten to take down trees, at fifteen to rewire the porch. But more on that later.  I don't know why S was so opposed to moving. He wasn't, really -- it was just the money. But I'm a big believer in floating possiblity and seeing what comes through --cast your bread upon the waters sort of thing -- so one day I dialed up the slimiest realtor in the world and he slithered over and made faces and told us what we needed to fix, and said sign here, and there we were, trying to polish the turd enough to make someone say, "What a great house!"  We showed the house all through the improvement stage, which was a challenge to me, chief cleaner and straightener.  I have never in my life seen S work so hard. The man is a workhorse as it is at his job, but he would literally come home every night and slave for another seven hours on something. Painting. New tub surround and faucets. Parge coating on the wire lathe in the basement. Ripping out the ceiling of the upstairs hall to fix a light, then replacing it. Repainting the entire house. Rewiring the entire house. Pitching a tent in the home depot parking lot. Cramming supplies into our tiny car, or borrowing a truck here and a truck there. Getting rid of stuff, and rid of stuff, and rid of stuff, and rid of stuff. I never saw him. We barely spoke. The baby had to help him with this stuff if she were to have any quality time with him at all -- she'd sit and play with the benign tools and ask him questions.  Where did we get all the money to fix it? We borrowed some. We maxed some credit. We did without other things. I prayed. I cleaned as much as he did. I worked my ass off, too. I donated fifty boxes of my books. Scavengers used to wait until our trash night and go to town on the stuff we threw out week in and week out -- it was like a curb sale with no profit. Philly is a trashpicking town.  Meanwhile, people looked at the house and left without buying, and I planted St. Joseph in the lawn and despaired.  By the time we did manage to unload it, about 103 days after we listed it, S had put together what was the most mechanically sound property in the area, and it was freshly painted in shades of lavender, peach and sand.  I don't want you to think he never lifted a finger before this happened. He redid the baby's room, transforming it from a cat lounge to a nursery, with a new wood parquet floor, painting it a beautiful shade of green, making it perfect. He and my dad hammered for days while I was pregnant. My dad helped with many other things, too. Thank God for him and S's friend M, an Army helicopter pilot, and S's dad, who arrived one weekend from Toledo to help repaint, because between the four of them, we actually got the place looking nice enough to find a buyer.  We sold the house in late July to a family whose only English speaker was eleven years old, and thank God for them.  Then we found another realtor -- the selling realtor was proving to be difficult -- and found this rowhouse.  Part of the process of leaving the First Anonymous Rowhouse was convincing S about what we could afford. He didn't want another row -- he wanted a twin. Bigger, bigger, bigger, is S's motto (he doesn't do most of the cleaning). We were on realtor.com twenty four hours a day. The first neighborhood being what it was, we couldn't get much for the house -- about sixty thousand dollars. We hadn't lived there long, so that didn't leave a huge pocket of profit for dropping someplace else. Everyone in the family helped a little bit -- I prostrated myself and went dialling for dollars one night -- but a great deal of that went to the 100 things we had to complete as a condition of sale (for instance, we dropped two grand on a new walkway and front steps, because the horrible Philly winters had done those in, and another $500 on a new roof because of Hurricane Floyd). We had no savings -- but good enough credit to finance something 100%. Still, it would need to be very modest. But hopefully in a better neighborhood to make it worthwhile. We didn't want a lateral move.  Then we found the Rowhouse.  I make up my mind very quickly about things. I walk into a store, see something, and buy it without dithering or preamble. Inventory being what it was (i.e. not much), I knew we had to act fast. After seeing about five houses close to here, one of which we lost a bid for, and in between my cat Randolph had the seizure and died -- we were going to offer Friday on the first house, and he died; we saw this on a Saturday. Having only one cat that actually liked the baby changed things somewhat.  I walked into this house, the first day it was listed, took one look at Mrs. Verynice's highly rowhouselike, yet completed, decorating scheme, pictured myself hanging out with the baby here and working on websites in the basement, and told S, "That's the one."  It's nice, he said, but isn't it a little small?  1068 square feet. Good thing we'd had all those curbside purges of our crap.  Yes, but how are we going to do better? It was right at the edge of affordability -- the better neighborhood account for a third higher price for a third smaller house.  I don't know, he hedged. I have to think a little more. Maybe we can do something else.  No, no, no. That's the house I want. The houses we've seen are two types: bigger, old people houses where a dog pissed on the rug for twenty years, but with a nice kitchen and no yard, on the other side of the avenue, which is going to go to hell first.   Or smaller, needs some stuff done, on the better side, with good carpets and a yard.  That's it. That's all we're going to see that we can afford. And besides, I'm the one stuck in it all day and that's the one I want to be stuck in.  All right.  By one o'clock that afternoon we were signing the offer papers. By five it was accepted.  My brothers and dad drove by. "Nice in 'ere!" they said. "Good choice!"  And even though any neighborhood can go down any time, it is still nice in 'ere, three years later.  The day we moved was heaven to me. A rowhouse that was painted, with only a semi-vintage heater, in the middle of a block! So it's cheaper to heat and cool. No death-defying basement steps. A semi-finished basement.   And just a nice feel, a feeling you could leave your door unlocked, or play with the baby on the lawn, or have a lawn ornament that no one would try to steal except kids goofing around on a Saturday night.  In the old Rowhouse I didn't have as much insomnia, but I was always afraid to be up in the night and downstairs -- I don't know why. Intruders. A creepy feel about the place. The possibility of vermin.   Not that all that doesn't exist here as a possibility, because I know it does. ("Don't get too comfortable," say my brothers. "It's still the city.") (They all still live here, too -- they have to, for their jobs. But their neighborhoods are nicer).   But I have spent more time roaming around in this Rowhouse at three o'clock in the morning, completely cozy -- loving that, if I have to be missing sleep, at least it's a time I can have to myself.  In an Anonymous Rowhouse I picked especially, in August one Saturday morning.

      I had a great meeting at the Catholic church. Reminded me why I do what I do. They gave me carte blanche to redesign their site, which is always a fun thing to have. I love doing new designs. The rectory was lovely. And I got to see the inside of a school before it opened for the first time in my life. There was an interesting anticipation in the air -- a school is really made by its students. ____________________________________  We got a catalog in the mail of little Halloween trinkets. Everything is sold in lots of two dozen. P had a field day putting X's on everything she liked. I went through the X's with her, and I liked all the little Jack O'Lantern puppets and stuff, but I had to draw the line at two dozen rubber rats. "They're cute!" she said. "They're babies!"  Ugh . . .  Only P would X a two-dozen-piece lot of rubber rats and beg me to order it online.  ____________________________________  S was supposed to work late past two nights, but schedule changes put him home earlier. I was able to mosey over to the shopping center tonight, where I bought mint chocolate chip ice cream. __________________________________  P was using the toilet before her bath, so I went in and collapsed on the bed, moaning, "owwww!" because every muscle in my body ached. So tired today. S came in and fell next to me, declaring, like Arnold Schwarzenegger in Kindergarten Cop, "They're horrible!" I started laughing because that's how tired kids make you. I could've fallen asleep for about two days right then and there.

      I love talking to my former college roommate -- we lived together freshman year at Small Suburban College Named for a Woodland Animal. I was sixteen, she was eighteen, and for some reason that baffled both of us, we chose to live in the party dorm when we went to bed at 10 and got up at 6:45 AM.  The dorm was coed, but the men were in the opposite wing, and the stench of beer and moldy pizza crusts crept from their hall to ours in a sort of garbage-scented mist. They hung pulltabs in their windows in chains. We spied on them while they were asleep during the day and started a correspondence with one of them, sliding overly Shakespearean notes under our respective doors about the possibility of a wine and cheese party.  We were always inviting someone to a wine and cheese party, and we plotted for weeks around these little gatherings. Completely underage, we had alcohol in the fridge at all times for medicinal purposes, but the same bottle of wine would be there for weeks on end. We distributed pez machines as party favors. We did tarot readings. We played scrabble with foreigners. We put a reception desk at the door of our room, and I would sit there smiling, with my hands folded.  Those days! Now we're both moms and we get together for playdates. We went this year overnight to Atlantic City, the first time I've ever left P overnight, just the two of us. We brunched at the Showboat and the Borgata. I've posted on it before. But most of all, we stayed up laughing half the night, about, as K said, "What could have been. What would have been. What SHOULD have been."  Those were the days, and the thing was that we knew it.  We were complete geeks that existed in a world of our own, and to this day neither of us remembers studying, but we do remember laughing and singing showtunes in harmony and dancing in our room the the Dirty Dancing soundtrack, doing a 2-person conga line to the merengue. We used to use hairspray bottles to sing into the mirror. We kept the curtain closed at all times.  During orientation, we hid in our room, but they got wise to us and marched us forcibly to the three-legged sack race.  We both had steady boyfriends -- mine was S -- but they were at different schools, so, what was the difference if we entertained the attentions of numerous other Panamanians and 25-year-old ex-infantrymen? We ironed shirts for them, we shared pizza with them, we gave them copies of our homework and edited their essays. We sat behind our teacups snarking and sniping people all around us while nodding politely and saying all the right things when approached.   We had a code name for everyone on the campus so we could talk about people right in front of them.  Our wandering eyes wandered to a pair of brothers from Ecuador, and they received the full scrabble, wine, cheese, pez machine and tarot card treatment. People wondered about our mystique. Or else they shook their heads and wrote us off. We spent many a Saturday at dances, wearing matching black dresses and trying to ditch our dates for pastures new.   "You were so worldly then," I said today to her, in awe. I was an innocent. Believe it.  "I was never worldly, until I got to Vegas!" she replied, and we started laughing again.  Those were the days . . . the late eighties, when I could have a Led Zeppelin falling angel poster on the wall and she could sit on her bed on a corduroy headrest called a husband, saying, "I wonder if I ever will have a husband? This one's good enough for now" and smiling her cheshire cat smile. Off to dinner early in our matching denim jackets, to get the cheesecake with cherry sauce before anyone else did. The world was a string of pearls and it was in our pockets.  The Ecuadorians told us how beautiful we were, we ignored the ringing phones with our boyfriends checking in, and we knew it and we were.

      While I'm struggling with writer's block this afternoon, please enjoy the following poem, which is one of my favorites.  somewhere i have never travelled, gladly beyond any experience,your eyes have their silence: in your most frail gesture are things which enclose me, or which i cannot touch because they are too near  your slightest look will easily unclose me though i have closed myself as fingers, you open always petal by petal myself as Spring opens (touching skilfully,mysteriously)her first rose  or if your wish be to close me, i and my life will shut very beautifully ,suddenly, as when the heart of this flower imagines the snow carefully everywhere descending; nothing which we are to perceive in this world equals the power of your intense fragility:whose texture compels me with the color of its countries, rendering death and forever with each breathing  (i do not know what it is about you that closes and opens;only something in me understands the voice of your eyes is deeper than all roses) nobody,not even the rain,has such small hands   e.e. cummings

      I'm off to meet with the Catholics about their website, and I slept like crap, so I stopped and got myself some iced tea and a nice breakfast sandwich at Wawa. I am supposed to low-carb, because of the insulin thing, but I never do. Protein usually helps my head not to be so fuzzy. Interestingly, it's the thing I like to eat least. A world without carbs might as well not be a world.  Anyway, I left the sandwich on the table, and I did some stuff, and when I returned it was all ravaged by my cat that we found outside. I found part of the muffin under the basement door, like a dead animal trophy. I can't tell where she had her nasty little lips on it.  I rewrapped it and put it in the fridge; this is the sort of thing S will probably still eat, but for me the anticipation was ruined. I had a bowl of miniwheats instead.  This cat also drinks out of your glass (obviously I then go and get a new glass), picks bones out of the trash, and eats potato chips that P drops on the carpet.  You can take the cat out of scavenging, but you can't take scavenging out of the cat.

      Perhaps one of the few moments of recklessness that arrived in my life of extreme caution did so before I even had a say about it.  I sucked my thumb and wrecked my mouth. I quit cold turkey when I was seven.  I had a blankie and everything -- two, actually. I always had so many stuffed animals (the apple doesn't fall far from the tree with P), that I never had a favorite, but those blankets, boy, I think my mom had to pry them out of my death grip when I was sleeping in order to wash them.  The first was yellow and had satiny edges, and the print on the blankie was of yellow and white flowers that had an abstract airiness, like tissue paper.  The second was also yellow (damn my stupid brothers and the neutral colors they inspired) and had a repeating print of large 1970's style rabbits with the big soulful eyes. The rabbits were, of course, brown, along with everything else in the seventies. They had pink ribbons printed around their necks.  I remember once visiting a petting zoo and petting the sheep when we were in kindergarten. My first thought upon touching the sheep: "What a good blankie this would make!" I think ALa71 was there.   Anyway, the damage was already done by the time I finally went to a real dentist.  My parents didn't have dental insurance back in the day. Blame the police department; both ALa71 and I can tell horror stories about the third-world clinic where we were forced to get all our medical care, standing in a line behind a thousand other people. When I got cavities when I was little, my mom took me to some eight hundred year old dude down under the El place who charged my mom two bucks a filling.  I didn't mind the dentist back then.  But eventually human rights prevailed in police and fire department arbitration, and I found myself sitting in a real dental chair, the sound of drills all around me, thinking, I wonder if they'll give me a balloon when I leave?  The dentist took one look in my mouth, and his mouth took on a serious cast.  "Did you suck your thumb? he asked me. My mother was out in the waiting room. They let you out of your parents' sight in those days.  "Yes," I replied. I wasn't sure if that were a good or bad thing. I was about to find out.  He tsked. "For how long?"  "Until I was seven." I think I was eight at that point.  The dentist started shaking his head, the way dentists do. "Thumbsucking," he said. "Very bad. It looks like you've got most of your twelve year old teeth in here" (I told you I was precocious!) -- "You're going to need the orthodontic man."  And so it began.  Five years of braces. A paletal expander, which had a key my mom had to crank to get my jaw to expand -- right on the roof of my mouth! A headgear -- if you think my brothers were good at mocking and ridiculing me before, you should've been present for the headgear years. Thank God I only had to wear it at night, unlike some goober guy at my school! And all during it, fillings, fillings, fillings.  Okay, I'm going to confess that I drank no milk whatsoever until I was seventeen years old, ate enough candy to comprise the gross national product of a small island republic, and basically did whatever I wanted dental hygiene wise, because my mother couldn't be bothered to pay attention to her fourth child. However, I will also report that I never saw a toothbrush NEAR my brother K's mouth his entire childhood, and the man doesn't have a single cavity to this day!  Genes.  "You got your father's crooked teeth," my mother told me with a sort of twisted fondness, "and my rotten teeth."  I actually know people on this earth who have never had novacaine! My dental woes have not ended. I even had to have the same root canal done twice in a year! I love to watch people squirm when I say, "Yeah, this time it was eight needles, but most of them were in that little tiny flap of skin right above the gum on your front teeth --"  I'm a dental pro. I hate it, but I just think of having something amputated without chloroform during the battle of Gettysburg, and that makes me feel ever so much more courageous.  But I will say this. My mouth is worth a fortune and it's in extremely good repair. I will go without food for months to afford a crown (not that I look like I have, then  I just start eating ramen noodles, which are five for a dollar). I smile all I can, because every single tooth in my mouth is worth several thousand dollars. I floss twice daily. For someone who takes very good care of their teeth, I certainly got the shallow end of the gene pool on this, and I blame that damn blankie with the brown rabbits for starting it all.  I looked at Britney Spears' preternaturally white teeth the other day and leaned closer to the page in People magazine.  "Those are all porcelain veneers," I said to Steve. "How could it be otherwise?"  He leaned closely too. "I bet you're right."  "Do you know how much  pain  that poor girl must've been in?"  Spoken like a true veteran of The Chair.  P wouldn't let them look in her mouth last year, but this year she finally had a full dental exam. S, that bastard, has no cavities at all in his mouth, but he never wore his retainers so his teeth aren't as straight as mine.  The dentist looked in P's mouth and pronounced her "one of those kids that will be cavity-free. Keep up the good work!"  " Finally ," I said, "she got something good out of her genetic inheritance!"  The next week I went in and had two bonded fillings done, as usual. Only six novacaine needles that time.

      P dictated this story today. Her mouth was full of potato chips for most of the dictation, so I did the best I could. She didn't conclude it -- or did she? I thought we'd illustrate it later, then do it in watercolors.  Okay, here goes.  Once upon a time, there was a little bug with a mouse.  The bug was named Trigger.  The mouse's name is Emma.  They went together on an adventure.  They met a big giant tortoise. His name was Gourd.  They rode on his back.  A big giant angry lizard got his own machine, and Trigger wanted to buy it.  And a chameleon went taking them in the back, and Trigger said, "I want these!"

      I would like to take this opportunity to express my displeasure toward calendars and people who feel they need to attend events and want to know when they are.  I spent three weeks getting one job's calendars in order. Okay, I made extra money doing it but I was bent into a pretzel over it. Right now I am turning into a hunchback getting them done for the church newsletter. Tomorrow I have a meeting where we will discuss . . . calendars and my completion of them.  I think that this newsletter needs a few more things to stuff in it, so I can four-column the thing and go down to 7 point type and go up to 12 pages.  Whenever the other designer typesets it, there's way more air. My feeble attempt at this thing looks like a typesetting nightmare. There isn't room for a 1.5 x 1.5 icon of a sunshine. People had better put their reading glasses on!  This is from Slaughterhouse-Five and could be my theme song. It's from a production of Cinderella done by the British POWs in Germany, according to Kurt Vonnegut:  Goodness me! The clock has struck! Alackaday, and fuck my luck.  This newsletter will stay eight pages if it is the last thing I will ever do.  After the typing, the search for space.

      I always laugh at the way P says things, because I love her little voice and I think she's so damn cute. Last night she and S made hypoallergenic corn muffins, and I made her repeat the words "corn muffin" because I loved the way she said it.  She looked worried and refused to say it -- kids her age get really sensitive about being made fun of.  "I just loved the way you said it!" I said. "I want to hear you say it again."  She said, "Corn muffin" reluctantly. And then said it again. And then giggled.  For the past eighteen hours, I have not been able look at my daughter without her yelling "corn muffin!" at the top of her lungs and bursting out laughing.  Maybe I should've named her that?

      I was in choir in elementary school and we sang a bunch of showtunes, "Sunrise, Sunset" from  Fiddler on the Roof  among them (Is this the little girl I carried? Is this the little boy at play? I don't remember growing older, when did they?) We also sang stuff from  Grease , but that isn't relevant to this post.  Anyway, on the phone with ALa71 this afternoon she was saying that isn't it amazing, she doesn't remember a time when her younger son wasn't potty trained. Just like I don't now remember that time with P, or when she didn't eat at all, or when she couldn't walk, or when she first could put Lego bricks together. All these things just come, one at a time, skill upon skill, until you have a full-fledged person standing in front of you with little opinions.   My father used to say that parenthood was great until the first time that the kid looked at you and said, "You know what I think?" The birth of opinion was the beginning of the end.  That wasn't true of me, of course. He loved all my opinions. I was, and am, his particular favorite.  There is a tendency to rush skills, i.e. worry when the child doesn't hit a certain milestone at a certain time. It's a strange kind of time warp in which you want your child to grow up and stay small at the same time. And the progress that they make, even their physical growth, is almost impossible to detect, when you're right next to them all of the time.   You remember, of course, but those memories are just like a drawer of pretty scarves that you pull out and look at once in a while. Here is one where P is so chunky and smunchy, wearing a little suit that says MINI GARDENER with pink stripes. She stretches when she wakes up, and her little lips screw up and her eyes pinch shut. She pulls up her tiny knees and yawns.  Here is P sitting in the high chair for the first time eating sweetpotatoes, looking at me like, "What  is  this crap?"  Here I am frazzled from working and running to and fro getting her to the babysitter, and having a day off, and lying next to the bed while she naps, reading a romance novel about the great Chicago fire on the floor, just hiding from everyone with the house all quiet in the afternoon.  Here she is falling asleep as I sing to her.  Here she is skinning her knee on the concrete and being so surprised I carry her all the way home.  Here she holds a toothbrush in her hand with a smile.  Here she writes on the Rowhouse living room wall with blue chalk.  Here she makes a sweet noise and pets the kitty.  She asked the other day for a kaleidescope -- she must've seen one on television. And I looked at her and thought, that's what you are like, always changing, little fragments making up the whole you I love, so beautiful.   We were in the supermarket yesterday for a couple of things and an old man was behind us. He asked P about her pink frog and P was a bit timid with him. He followed us outside after he was through checking out and said behind me:  "Enjoy her . . . I have two girls . . . they're all grown up now."  I turned back and saw his eyes were sad and proud, and I wanted to hug him. S was busy with P but I wanted to acknowledge the sunrises and sunsets this man had seen with his daughters he so obviously loved.  "It goes fast, doesn't it?" I said.  "You don't know how fast," he said. "You don't know how."

      Why did I say I would do the church newsletter? Why? When will I learn?  The envelope came Friday from my pastor, who is in Minnesota.There are three articles missing, which I have to chase up. He wants it done by the 20th. The person who is supposed to supply two of them does not own an answering machine. One part of the handwritten, hand-edited pile of stuff (my pastor does have beautiful handwriting, I'll give him that) I'm looking at has scribbled on it "call Janet about the chancel choir." More phone calls! When will people learn -- DESIGN does not equal COORDINATION? Have it DONE please, before you hand it to someone for pro bono expertise that normally costs seventy five dollars an hour!   This happens all the time. I am taking down my shingle. No, I'm not a designer -- that must've been someone else.  I don't remember how to use quark well, and it frustrates me. The new OS on this machine is kicking my ass -- it won't reference the art correctly. I am stuck with 72 dpi, color clip art I downloaded in gif format off the internet as art for this thing, when I need 300 dpi, grayscales in tif. It kills me to put together something so lacking in my usual finesse. I know that's an ego thing.  Tomorrow I have to go meet with the Catholics about their website, which is yet another thing I've said I'd do. Dropkick me Jesus.  I like the work, I'll get it all done, but I would like hugs and commisserations for all the extra little stuff I always do --  yet never get credit for.   And someone to please lead a rousing chant of "never again, never again, never again."

      After the angels singing all around me, I was wheeled away into my new life of motherhood without a single clue. When I sought clues from books, they were usually wrong.  I won't bore you here with how many medical things went wrong with me -- they could fill a book in themselves, but most were minor or remedied by numerous concurrent antibiotics -- nor the stories of how the baby never slept and we checked her breathing every two minutes, because she didn't and we did.   While I was still in the hospital, I loved the nursery and sending P back there. I know people say, "NO, I want the baby with me the whole time!" I didn't. I wanted professionals taking care of her every moment, and I wanted her to stay there until she was five. I couldn't believe they would let two amateurs like me and S actually take her home. Prior to that, my experience with care and nurturing was limited to veterinary pharmaceuticals and cans of Fancy Feast.  They brought her to my room every twenty minutes, because maternity ward nurses are snarky about moms who insist on nursing. They want the kid quiet and a bottle of formula does that just fine. When you lay down the NO FORMULA law, every time the baby wrinkles her nose, they ACT like they're being all supportive of your nursing, but really they're like, "so, she thinks formula is inferior nutrition, huh? Well, let's show her. Don't let that bitch get a wink of sleep. Baby cries, she wants Mommy. If we can't take care of this baby the way we've been doing it for  twenty five years  in this place, she can HAVE her!"  One nurse said, "Ninety five percent of moms leave here nursing, but within a week most of them quit. It might be that way with you, too. Here's a bag of formula to take home."  I made up my mind there and then that I would not be one of those Rowhouseland dropouts, and that I would nurse come hell or highwater. Good thing, too, because the next couple of weeks provided plenty of both hell and highwater in the nursing department.   Even with my woeful lack of mothering experience, I maintained the following truisms from the animal kingdom about nursing and co-sleeping (we had the baby in our room in a special co-sleeper crib):  1. Does the mother cat have kittens and go out and buy little cans of kitty formula? 2. Does the mother panda put her baby to sleep in another part of the bamboo forest?  No, and no. I did what came naturally.   If only learning to be a mother were as natural as learning how to feed the baby!  So the day they kicked me out and sent me home I was absolutely clueless. I told you before how I spent days sobbing. I just didn't feel up to the job, and I was sleep deprived to boot, but little P was a good eater and a cuddlebug, albeit a fussy one, so S and I started the process of falling insanely in love with her.  Even back then, S was a genius at getting her to sleep. He composed a whole series of little nonsense songs to conk her out, which he did by rocking her gently in his hands. She still remembers them on some cellular level when he sings a snippet of one. We had a really solid division of labor -- I was the cow and he was the pasture, or I was the dining hall and he was the entertainment director. Diaper duty, we shared. Neither of us slept for months.   "I have never," his mother whispered to me on one visit, "seen him so loving and open as he is with that baby. She has transformed him."  It makes my eyes tear up to think of how true that is even now, and I wholeheartedly agree. S and P are a pair, and sometimes I wonder where I fit into that dynamic, but then I remember that I made the whole damn thing happen in the first place, and that is an honorable plain to inhabit.  But back in those days, emotionally I had all that crap about my own mom swirling around, and I actually was back in therapy -- my therapist was a retired minister in those days, and I would take the baby with me in her little car-seat carrier -- and we had a lot of work to do.  Old stuff began to shift, and it was a beautiful thing.  They talk about mothering the mother. I really felt I needed that early on. I wanted my mom to come down on a flaming cloud and show me the ropes. I had some good support -- ALa71, my sister in law, my mother in law. But then one day the notion of mothering the mother clicked.  You get your mothering instinct from inside, and you get it from knowing your baby. She teaches you, and you teach her. I was amazed when she smiled for me, stopped crying for me. I had always had abysmal luck with calming children before.  Six months in, I was fairly confident in the job. And amazingly, I didn't care as much about losing my own mother. I didn't need to be mothered as much as I felt I did before. I  was  the mother. And I was doing the mothering.  Oceans of thanks to my beautiful daughter for showing me what to do.

      We have been strolling P around malls since she was about a week old, and it's always been on her terms.  When she was very little, she was a fussbudget, so we couldn't even stop walking or she would start screaming, and she usually wanted to eat. I have told you before about her undiagnosed reflux disease and her endless colic and complaining, but at the time the only remedy for it was to feed her. Then I would try to find a discreet place, but invariably if you try this in public, however discreetly, either a gang of construction workers walks by the instant you commence, or if you're in your car, the people from the cars on either side of you return to their vehicles at that exact moment. I cared less and less about this as time went on.  I have a particular recollection of going to the furthest corner of the Bloomingdale's furniture department and finding a nice chair to settle down into, when a saleslady approached and asked what I thought I was doing.  "I'm feeding the baby," I said. I hadn't started yet, obviously.  "A bottle?!" she demanded to know.  "Uh . . .no."  "Well, there is a ladies room over behind the down comforters. You can feed the baby there."  "Would you eat  your  lunch in a toilet?" I asked her.  She went away, but we ended up at the car instead, P by now screaming, with the owners of the two cars on either side returning forthwith.   I still feel sanctimonious in the mall when I see kids with their propped bottles of formula in their strollers while their moms shop. I may have spent half of those earlier mall visits in the Sears dressing room with P, but I know it was the better choice.  But anyway, there we were in the mall, for better or for worse, while she was very little. As she grew older, she was in a stroller, and then later she was mobile and sassy and then later full of piss and vinegar and then later unable to even go to the mall, because she had such unbelievable tantrums.   Just recently we have reinstituted the mall visit as a diversion, because, as P says, "I so bigger and taller! I growed up! I a  good listener  to Mommy now."  So today we went and bought the following:  1. one pink stuffed frog named Lotus 2. two rides on the merry go round for P and S 3. two mini packets of candy corn for Justrose 4. two greeting cards for soldiers  Ah, how visits to the mall have changed.  I remember the first time I went to this particular mall -- built on the site of the holiday amusement park where John Phillip Sousa used to play -- and I was about thirteen. That day, I bought a pair of BONGO jeans with a crazy hawaiian print acid washed into them. And a turquoise shirt. Leave me alone, okay -- it was the early eighties. I loved those jeans! I still remember them.  Today, I saw many things I should like to have, provided I chance to trip over a sugar daddy in the street who takes a fancy to me.   These things were:  1. A Juicy couture carpetbag in pink with graffiti on it. 2. A pink sweater with a beautiful V neckline, in mohair, and a big sparkly pink jewel on the decollete 3. A really wild dress (handkerchief-hem) in rose covered with all kinds of beading and jewels: Isn't it gorgeous! I said to S. I'd love to have somewhere to wear it. He replied: If by gorgeous, you mean hideous, then . . .yes. 4. A new pair of sneakers. 5. A three hundred fifty five dollar blue glass bowl on a ravishingly pink pedestal. 6. Expensive shampoo and conditioner. 7. Mrs Fields cookies. 8. A lifesize cutout of Orlando Bloom in his Legolas costume. 9. A mauve fedora with a cream satin band. 10.A pair of rose cotton Victoria's Secret pyjamas covered with pink dachshunds. 11.A set of pink sheets that looked like something from a bordello in India.   . . .did I mention my favorite color is pink?  Anyway, no sugar daddies were forthcoming so we left the mall and I tore into my candy corn. But I was glad to have had a good and quiet outing that made P so happy, and she clutched her new pink frog the whole way home.

      When I was contemplating seminary last year ALa71 advised me as gently as she could against it.  "They'll take whatever's pure out of you," she warned. "You came about it all the right way." And perhaps she was right. I have decided against it for the time being. In part because of her advice. I came to religion precisely by my own motivations and absolutely nothing else. It's been a lifelong process, but it's always been on my terms.  My family has had so many pots boiling in its collective kitchen that it's a wonder that there's any room for a single dishtowel. I've had therapists sit slack-jawed while I recount the whole sad and tempestuous history of my biological clan. I haven't written about most of it here because many of the protagonists are still alive and I love them very much, understand their motivations, and would never boil their bones for my own soup. Suffice it to say, go several generations back and begin, and you'll have all the sweet and sour, salt and bitter, spicy, zesty, savory stories you could ever possibly want to devour.    What did I do as a backlash against all this revelry? Well, I guess I found the Lord.  Let us begin in the G-rated version.  My father was born a Roman Catholic. His mother was Italian. His father was Irish. That in and of itself was great cause for scandalization in those days. His entire family slept in one room of a rowhouse, and they didn't have indoor plumbing. His Italian grandfather had the other bedroom.  My dad went to Catholic school, and even contemplated the priesthood. Eventually he met my mother, a Presbyterian divorcee, owing to her ill-fated union with the captain of the football team. Who, by the by, my dad had the privilege of beating the shit out of in a separate and unrelated incident.   Anyway, as you know, they got married and had the three monstruous mongrels and magnificent me. The Catholics welcomed the fruits of their loins into the flock, but my mother, as a filthy Protestant, was rebuffed by the papal establishment. We were christened there, right down at Mater Dolorosa, so as far as the pope's concerned to this very day, I am a catholic.  But my parents, fed up by the whole injustice of it all, did the Henry VIII thing. They fled to the Episcopalians.  Growing up in the Episcopalian church was a lackadaisical affair. It's just like being Catholic, except you never have to feel guilty about anything. You can go to church when you want. No one makes you confess a thing. You can dance with a tumbler of scotch in your hand and whisper curses if you smash your hand in the car door. If it were any further from church dogmatically, it would be a cocktail party with those mini weiners in the barbeque sauce and an occasional "hallelujah!" when someone refilled the punchbowl.  Interestingly, though, I thrived in this semi-secular setting. I saw beyond the apparent lack of commitment to the mysteries beneath. I practically memorized every word of my confirmation class at ten, and asked the tough questions, like, "Are people married in heaven?" My church was tiny and there were only two of us in the class. I viewed the meeting with the bishop on my confirmation day as a major life event. And I loved the physical presence of the church: the cobblestoned floor, the gilt-and-bare-beam altar with its surveying angels. I loved the murmured prayers of the liturgy, their surety and theological underpinnings. I loved the way my little head buzzed whenever the priest laid his hands upon it for a blessing. And so, because it doesn't have the same kinds of anti-female hangups that the Catholic church has, I found myself following in my brothers' footsteps and was up on the altar in short order, serving as an altar boy in drag.  That lasted until my family imploded, then my mom died and we moved away.  My late teens and early twenties were almost entirely church-free. We moved around a lot; I tried to get there on Christmas Eve and Easter. I don't think my commitment ever wavered -- I had the upbringing with the Episcopalians; and the Christian girlscouts and camp with ALa71.   I just felt I had better things to do with my Sundays. I did used to try and go to holy week services with my Nan, if my college vacations lined up with it. I loved, and love, the cycle of those services: Ash Wednesday, Palm Sunday, Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, and Easter. This year, I read for all four services during Holy Week and it was an incredibly religious experience, particularly after having seen  The Passion of the Christ  a few weeks before. The words had some real resonance.  I came to Lutheranism when we moved to the first anonymous rowhouse. I had been attending a sort of fundamentalist Presbyterian fellowship, which was kind of like a rock concert for the unchurched with semi-public chastenings for its membership whenever someone violated a church rule. That wasn't cool with me.   What I liked about Lutheranism was its ease and commitment to lay ministry. By "lay" I mean people who aren't ordained. Luther was a Catholic priest who disagreed with lots of things, nailing his thoughts to the door of his church in protest. Thus began protestanism and the reformation. So this denomination had all the evangelical tendency -- spreading the good news -- of some of the more "on fire for the Lord" sects, but none of the holier-than-thou. It had a band, and I sang in it for three years. It had a contemporary service, and I loved that for a while. But it had a regular building with the angels hovering and the light through the pink stained glass on Sunday mornings. It had an altar. We sang from hymnals, not from words on a screen. It was a good marriage of my history and my aspiration.  You see I haven't mentioned S here. S is the son of a preacherman. His dad is a Presbyterian chaplain, and his childhood was one long church service.Utterly sick of anything smacking of "Onward Christian Soldiers," that makes him practically areligious. He believes and all, but can't be bothered to darken the door. He is also a scientist, and has some very strong opinions regarding dogma. We baptized P Lutheran without it being an issue, since the only time she is likely to attend church is with me. Yet I hear him reading her stories from the Children's Bible we have. And he doesn't give a damn if I go to church or not and gives me the space to do it. He will in fact ask me, "You're going to church today, right?" before I've even made up my mind whether I am or not.  I went back to traditional worship when I hit my thirties. There's a lot to be said for the old hymns, and I wanted to hear the traditional liturgy again and to be a part of it like I was as a kid. So I volunteered to read, then all the old ladies in my service raved about my clear voice and my impassioned rendering of the Word, so I signed on as a liturgist. What does a liturgist do? Read all the prayers and lead most of the worship, assisting the pastor. If he isn't there, you can pinch hit the whole thing, like I did today.   It's actually a very intense spiritual experience. I've said before it's all about letting God flow through you, and I really love doing it.  As for my love of the Catholic liturgy, well, what can I say. It's just in me. I love the saints, love the icons, love all the trappings. I love intercessionary prayer and see it as a powerful tool. Whatever brings you closer to God, right? And no one can stand in judgement of us but God himself.  My parents used to say, "You are raised in the church of our choice until you're eighteen. After that, it's up to you." I loved that very balanced and egalatarian approach to religion; it was one of the finest things they did for us. And yet I loved having something to believe as a child. I am not a big fan of secular humanism; Someone made all the glory that is in this world, and He deserves the credit.   My father doesn't usually take communion outside the Catholic church, but I was helping pastor with communion on Easter this year, and my dad attended at my urging. He did take communion. It was an incredible moment, sharing that with him.

      I've tried to avoid telling you in so many words what a veteran of melancholia I am, but since two of my gentleman readers compared me to Sylvia Plath last night (thanks boys) I guess I'd better just get it out of the way.  My similarities to Sylvia: 1. Poet 2. Mother 3. Loved a brooding poetic type in England long ago 4. Tendency for self to become brooding poetic type  And there it ends.   Just so you know, I adore Sylvia, and her writing. I appreciate how she suffered, and I know she was sick. But I always end up hating Ted and feeling sorry for her kids.  I can't help the poetic thing, by the way. I have been wired like that from day one. I had a professor who said thought is basically metaphor -- we compare what we see to what we know. So as a small kid, younger than P, the leather of our couch became a gorilla's chest to me. An egg slicer was a guitar. My mother's hands were like birds. And so on and so on and so on.  So I find myself extremely sensitive to things like weather. The weather has been like a sweater the past twenty four hours, and if there's a sun up there it's news to me. That's bad. I need to use my happy lite when I get that feeling.  Are there underlying issues? my therapist would say. Not really. We have no money, but that's always underlying. My one cat seems to have transformed to elderly in a few short weeks. P is starting school again, after a summer of school with only around five kids in the class, and I'm girding myself for the fevers, puke flus and racking coughs that will be attendant with more kids there. I'm worrying about whether to get her a flu shot or not -- she should have it, but she's allergic to eggs. We have some appointments coming up. S is liking his job, working hard, a little tense, but generally treating me well and as an equal partner despite my histrionics and his gruffness. And I am looking forward to our shore getaway, and praying like crazy about the weather.  So . . . we've established that I'm probably not clinically depressed at this time. What could it be?  I know what it is, because I smelled it for a moment the other day.   It's September.  If I could skip from August to October, I would. Frankly, if I could skip from August to May, I'd do it and do it with a smile.  I hate September. That's part of the reason I put the poem "Bavarian Gentians" by DH Lawrence in my favorite poem list. The first lines go something like, "Not every man has gentians in his house in soft September, in sad, slow Michaelmas."  Sad, slow Michaelmas. Amen DH.  My paternal grandmother died on the 13th; also S's birthday, so that's something happy to mitigate it. My mother, on the 21st. My stepsister's husband was tragically killed in September, I think it was the 30th. My maternal grandfather died also then. Muppet, my favorite cat on this planet, died on the 27th. I'm sure I can think of more.  Too many anniversaries and not enough sun.  I never liked starting school, even before anyone died. I never liked the newness. I liked the confidence of November and the weeks after the boredom set in. I have a bit of a hoptoad mind, so with my hands folded on that first day, I always remember thinking, in my way, "Good Lord, ten months in this room, I don't know how I'll be able to stand it."  I stood it. Somehow.  I often wished the year began in September and not January; isn't it, after all, the time when everyone jettisons long days in barefeet under the sun, dreaming of fireflies and eating raspberries and spying on toads in the yard, for the hideousness of corduroys that are too hot to be wearing and a teacher that barks, "Wipe that smirk off your face?"  Then there's the smell. Alix in Wunderland asked me on email about the smell and why it bothered me, and I promised her I'd post on it.  Before the smell are the geese, and they go over in arrows, honking. Then you're in the mood for cider. Mini pumpkins appear on the Rowhouse steps (though last year, the !&$#&$* squirrels ate mine, while everyone else's remained untouched!) The garden flag has to be switched to something with a cornucopia on it. Out with the petunias, in with the mums.  The lawn service dudes, with their sleeves of tattoos, come once or twice more and leave a note that says, "See you in the spring!"  Anonymous Rowhouse Road, which was a thoroughfare only for transients, shopping center ancients, and girls that touch their hair and adjust their short-short wedgies every two seconds as they sashay by all summer long, becomes a lane for little people heading to St. Nextdoor around the corner.  Then comes the smell.  Here is the smell: apples, frost, early dusk, old leaves and their fruity crispiness, getting up early and driving in traffic, no more sleeping late, the bumblebees gone from the garden, and a great big dollop of sad.  Like standing at the cemetery looking down at my mom's name, with a rust-colored container of mums in my hand.  Like thinking about every time so far in my thirty three years that everything forever changed, and what I planned to do about what remained.

      In order to give some semblance of meaning to my existence, I have decided to quantify my daily accomplishments, like Bridget Jones. Hers only had to do with her weight and how much she smoked and drank, but we all know the only self-indulgence in this Rowhouse is the crap you read in this blog. Oh, and the mini muffins. And maybe the romance novels. Without further adieu . . .  SATURDAY Loads of laundry washed, dried, folded and put away:4 Sets of sheets changed: 2 Cats brushed: 1 Child hairdressing sessions: 2 Dishwasher loadings and unloadings: 2 Child meals prepared: 4 Deodorant function tests: 2 Bathroom cleanings: 1 Litterbox changings: 1 Trash removals: 2 Room straightenings: 5 Personal showers: 2 Credit card customer service rep conversations: 1 Miles driven: 16 Money spent: $75 Child craft projects: 1 Blog entries: 4 (one still in draft) Volunteer duties dodged: 3 Phone calls left unreturned: 2 Spousal arguments: 1.5 Transients offering to paint address on curb: 1 (S gave him $2, I urged him to send him packing)  It occurred to me today as P watched the Muppet Treasure Island singalong I got her at the thrift store, for the fourth time this afternoon, that I'm always multitasking with her. I never just sit down and watch something with her. I MADE myself, but within five minutes of having her draped across my lap, I was brushing her hair out for the night. Then I brushed Pumbaa. I can never leave well enough alone. Must learn not to multitask so much.

      After a couple of years talking on the phone every day and being stuck home with our kids, ALa71, who is my oldest friend, and I decided to meet for breakfast one Sunday. I blew off church for the privilege of creamed chipped beef and a break from routine.  The next weekend, we did it again. And again. Then it became lunch. Then shopping. Then movies. Then weekend escapes, whenever we could, an afternoon here or an afternoon there, a time and a place where you could stop being MOMMY I CAN'T FIND MY FLUFFY DINOSAUR and HONEY DID YOU WASH THE GRAY BOXER BRIEFS and instead be that person you remembered from the distant past -- a person who laughed, wore makeup and earrings, and ordered refills of restaurant iced tea which were then served to you by a waitress.  It was, and is, the highlight of my week whenever we can pull it off.  It's almost as if it's way more than just a few hours. It feels, in comparison to my regular grind, like a week's vacation. Time to bump around in stores without trying to predict the behavior of a little complaining person, and because we can't eat in restaurants because of P's allergies, time to actually sit down and order whatever I want.  I hate when it ends and I have to drive home.  One of the things I've been trying to bring across, however successfully, in this blog is that motherhood and rowhouse care and maintenance are a full time job. Even if you aren't working a knot out of a little one's hair or sloshing a rag around in a toilet bowl, you're in the zone for that stuff and you're thinking about it. Particularly with the child care responsibility, you've always got antennae up and that vigilance never leaves.  And because I work from home, home is the office. I need only to open an email account or pick up the messages to find  someone  who needs  something  from me. 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  Not to make you think I don't like helping out, but there is my problem with  n o again. It's also hard to say no to people who pay you.  I only have one child, so while I have less work than some who have a passelful, I also, in a way have more work. She doesn't have anyone to entertain her. I'm the cruise director and she's the only person playing shuffleboard. It's wearying and wearing and wonderful and whimsical, but at the end of the day, it's like pulling three shifts.  I feel kind of guilty admitting this. I love being a mom. It's the toughest job you'll ever love. And I would do anything a thousand times over for my little smunchkin to be happy. But no one can do the same thing all the time. You need a break. This is why Hillary (though not my favorite person) said "it takes a village to raise a child."  But in today's world, everyone's all over the place. There is no village. The village burned down, or has seceded into 25 distinct fiefdoms. Or else, when the village comes back together, a la when the teachers at Phinie's school tell me she was zigging when she should have been zagging, I want to, in the words of one of the exhausted parents on a message board that ALa71 told me about once, "tell the village to shut the *#*! up!"  I had so much fun today with ALa71! I did my hair in a sort of very rowhousey updo, because it's really kind of murky and pre-stormy here. I wore big earrings and my medal and a cross on a new chain. I put on mascara and got in the car and drove away without worrying about car seat fastenings and drove out into the grand expanse of rowhouseland.  It's a block party weekend here, which meant half the blocks of my neighborhood were closed off. Block parties are a joke and annoying as all get out, and thank God they're not organizing one for this block this year. Last year they accused me of underpaying them by ten bucks, but then they distributed the budget at the end of the planning, and I noted it was  ten bucks  over their expected total receipts. I regard the entire institution with a sort of skepticism.  Anyway, we went thrifting and got Greek food. The topics of conversation over lunch:  -headscarves and their hipness -breasts -blogs -babies: the pros and cons of having more -gender dynamics in the family unit -skin conditions -how children actually don't like clowns -nautical decorating themes -smelly old people you meet in stores -bad comedians -antique stores and the need to take a shower afterward because of the mustiness -garlic and onion consumption -soldiers -vintage toy stores -turning radiuses on cars -the smell of florists -punishments that our parents' generation meted out -the nature of love  When you go out, all the old stuff falls away, and everything that mattered no longer does. You remember once that you were an individual with choices and aspirations, because once you have kids, your own aspirations go to the bottom of the list, below even those of the cat. And when you go back in, all the worries come back, but you feel you can deal with all of them . . . at least until the next time you go out.

      I didn't take Tylenol PM last night because I was really tired. Probably because I hadn't been tripping on Turkey Hill Peach Iced Tea as I had been for several previous days (we ran out, and I only buy it as a treat once in a while).  When P wheedled her way into my bed at midnight (S was still up backing up this computer in preparation for a new OS and software for one of my jobs) and as I slightly came to (that would've never happened on Tylenol PM), I noted that I had this river of PND going down the back of my throat.  The hurricane! I thought.  For allergy sufferers, different storms can bring huge clouds -- literally -- of crap from other parts of the world to irritate sensitive nasal passages and raw up unsuspecting throats. I have terrible allergies, as I've said before, but I don't usually take antihistamines during the day -- since I like to take Tylenol PM sometimes at night. (I know people who would still do this, with a NyQuil chaser, but I try not to mix similar-class OTC drugs.)  Anyway, when I got my allergy report this morning on email from the people at pollen.com, the offending substance, for the first time, was ragweed -- not necessarily the hurricane.  Ragweed! My nemesis. I can practically set an alarm clock to the moment in August when it starts bothering me, and in between I always forget what a true pain in the ass it is. It will go on through frost, by the way, damn its sorry raggy ass. I even had a mini coughing fit last night, I remembered -- a hard asthma cough.  So selective amnesia about the ragweed. It may be time to get that Zyrtec prescription refilled, stop the Tylenol PM for a while, dig out the inhalers, and cut out the iced tea.  But I was still thinking about the hurricane.  I have a former friend who moved down to Florida, and have some family there. I was most worried about her, but even if I wrote and asked how she is, she wouldn't answer me. She hates me that much. Why does she hate me? If you asked her she probably wouldn't tell you, and even if she told you it wouldn't be the truth. My loyalty, even for people who hate me, doesn't tend to go away. I'm stupid like that, so I won't slag her here. Maybe I will someday, though. After all I did for her, she deserves a good slagging. But not now. I just hope she's okay.  I started to think about the last major hurricane we had here. It was Floyd -- September 1999. I was newly pregnant. I had an ultrasound that day. I dragged myself in there, seven inches of rain be damned. Then I went to work and told them I'd be leaving early. I don't think they were happy, but my work was famous for letting you go finally when the eye of the storm was poised over our building, so you could hit the absolute worst of the weather.  They called Floyd a gangster storm and it was. I watched it, during my newly pregnant insomnia, on the weather channel down the shore. Watched it come all up the coast. ALa71 -- I think it made landfall at Kill Devil Hills, NC! By the time it got to Philly it was just a rainmaker, and what a rainmaker it was.  It wrecked the roof in the front of our house -- when I got home it was raining IN the house and the cats were standing around looking worried. Cats always worry about leaks. I don't know what it is in them.  I did a series of buckets and towels, which got covered with wet plaster.  By the by, we didn't fix that roof until we had to -- to sell the house. It never rained that hard again, though. I remember my dad saying on the day of Floyd that if you had a hole the size of a pinhead in your roof, it would still set off a huge leak, such a rainstorm was there.  Oh, wait -- we did patch the roof. Yes, another recovered memory. S up there with roof cement and the sun going down, cursing. Me, nine months pregnant, having to drive to Home Depot and get whatever it was -- like a ten gallon can of roof cement, and lugging it through the store while all the able-bodied hale male employees watched the pregnant chick struggling and agonizing over the weight of this thing -- because chivalry is dead in Philadelphia today.  The day after Floyd, I never saw a sky so blue and clean. It washed all the crap away -- all the ragweed pollen, all the mold spores, everything.  The next time I saw a sky that high and fair was September 11, 2001.

      It arrived today in a paper sheath that said, "This is your last issue!"  And that was fine with me.  I ordered it because it was inexpensive and I devour magazines -- or rather I used to. So I figured, why not.  It's not an original idea that these kinds of publications are conspiracies against women. And so I have several questions:  Does anyone really do what they say -- make the recipes, go on the diet, repaint the living room in a shade more serene?  Or are they just around to make you feel bad and remind you of what you don't have and can't do?  The main headline on this magazine is about decorating your house. Okay, I just skimmed it, but basically the wall art that is supposed to make my room "pop" cost more than the entire contents of the house I am sitting in at this exact moment. And that doesn't even include the window treatments.  Another article asked if that sandwich you're eating has too many calories. Of course it does, for Christ's sake. It's a sandwich. If you don't want calories, get a salad with no dressing.  A person wrote in and asked how the woman featured last month could weigh a certain hearty amount and still wear a size four. I have often wondered the same thing myself -- reading about women of my zaftig dimensions fitting into tiny sizes. Do they shop at a different store, where everything is a size 6 no matter what size it is?  And then there are the desserts. For Thanksgiving one year we did make a coconut cream pie from a magazine recipe. I will say that. But it came out kind of crappy. So so much for the test kitchen getting all the kinks out first.  I don't want to worry about what facial cleanser I'm using. Half the time if I use anything on my skin (see earlier post on my insane skin) except plain water the next day my face is covered in either zits, or a rash, or a rash consisting of zits. I don't have thirteen extra dollars for an eyeliner. I haven't been able to walk in high heels since I was fifteen. I will never make paella. My bathroom faucet will never reflect my personality, unless you're talking about the crud around the edges of it. My TV will never be concealed by bamboo doors for a sophisticated look. I will never trade in a pair of khakis and a white tee for a wool skirt, suede pumps and a fuschia cashmere sweater to drop P off to school in.  This is what I can do: get up, feed, clothe, school, and play with my kid, clean the rowhouse, take care of my animals, wash my crappy clothes, keep creditors barely at bay, work from home, write my blog, eat and sleep, toss out the odd volunteer effort on a semi-regular basis, be a wife and mother in the best way I know how.  Yet it's telling me I should have time to sew sage-colored linen drapes as well.  This,  it seems to say ,  is normalcy.  Why do we torture ourselves?

      When you have a daughter as allergic as ours, every new food is potentially suspect. Past the age of 3 or so, there's really nothing stopping you from letting the child try something new -- although food allergies can develop, disappear, recur, whatever -- there's no immunologic benefit to be realized by postponing the introduction of something new.  It just becomes a dance with chance, and whether you're in the mood for a trip to the E.R. if things go south.  As parents of an allergic kid, you get comfortable in your zone, then expand it -- little by little. Luckily for us, P's skin is really reactive, so if something's really going to cause a problem, a tiny bit on her arm will let us know. This isn't 100% foolproof -- wheat is her shadowy allergy, sometimes it causes a problem. Sometimes it doesn't. She can touch playdoh. Her lips swelled up from a cereal square one day and were fine the next. So we just avoid it for ingestion purposes. Though I catch her eating playdoh sometimes.  There's a whole gray area of food she eats, but not in quantity. It doesn't cause her to react externally, but her GI tract could potentially become inflamed inside. She's on medicine for reflux to cover that. They recommended scoping her some years ago to look but I said, "what are you looking for?" And they said, "Eiosinophils." And I said, "Let's assume she has them and treat from there."  Some of those shadowy foods, which are highly allergenic, that she previously didn't or couldn't eat, which she now can, are: watermelon. Cantaloupe. Orange juice. Strawberries. Spinach. Chocolate we make from baking chocolate at home.  And then, of course, she completely outgrew soy -- a staple food.  All this by way of saying P has had three new foods this week! Yes, ladies and gents, S and I have pushed the envelope once again. Please leave the requisite congratulations, because it's not easy when everything you give could have dire consequences. It's been a while since we've expanded her repertoire.  The foods were:  1. Lemonade (Countrytime powder; fresh lemons at school) 2. Tuna (canned, Charlie Tuna brand) 3. Mushrooms (Kennett Square regular)  S made such a nice baked chicken dinner tonight. He enjoys making new recipes for her. He even did a mushroom gravy. She LOVED the mushrooms and the lemonade, and that was a grand thing to see.  It took me back to when I was little and my mom made such creations every night. The whole Rowhouse smelled divine.

      Okay, maybe there is.  P used to throw massive tantrums in there, but now she is a joy, so it's nice to stroll around.  We needed the usual stuff -- toilet paper. But I bought a charm for my miraculous medal -- I need the loop so it doesn't keep flipping. And I bought a new chain, in case I destroy the one I have one trying to get the medal off.  And two romance novels.  And mint milano cookies.

      Characteristics:  1. Grumpy and snippy, with stress eating.  2. Somewhat melancholy, and with bad hair. And still obsessed with dry patch on arm, worrying it's cancer. Dermatologist on vacation.  3. Contemplates tossing it all in if she has to clean up cat vomit one more time.  4. Thinking "wouldn't it be nice if we could go to the zoo, he's never off" but knowing that we have to go get soy yogurt and cat litter instead  5. Thinking, "even if we did go, I wouldn't have a good time." And hating that that's true.  6. Longing for weekend away with good girlfriends, with plenty of calories and laughing over nothing.  7. Wondering why she didn't join the Peace Corps, write a screenplay, drink and dance all night and engage in various liaisons with mysterious foreign strangers while she had the chance.  8. Guilty because things aren't so bad. And motherhood is the ultimate fulfillment, in a way.  9. Until she looks at the checking account balance for the rest of the month.  10. Envisions day of reading and repose, but knows it will never happen in the Rowhouse -- that's what vacation villas are for.  11. If she could afford one.

      . . . with a twenty five pound cat in the sink. Ask me. Ask the fatboy.  His name isn't really fatboy. It's Pumbaa Crittery. And it's because he's a farting warthog -- or  was.  Now he's just fat. And he loves to sleep in the bathroom sink.  He is the last of our original cats.  As in a day after the great die-off of 2002 when S said to me, "Do you believe we've now lived through most of our original gang of cats?'  We had five.  I acquired them all -- S had nothing to do with it -- and for the record, before you start thinking I'm an animal rights loony (okay, I am, but I prefer to call it animal  welfare , there's a difference) I would never have that many again. Hey, c'mon. I have a human child now, and that kind of rearranges things in terms of time and resources.  Not because I wouldn't want to. Because they live, and you love them, and then they die and take three quarters of your heart with them, and better you should not have to endure that. Particularly since three of our cats, Angel, Eyebrow and Randolph, died within six weeks in one summer.  Eyebrow's and Angel's departures were planned -- they were both really sick, and we had them euthanized a week apart ("to consolidate the grief," I said -- it didn't work).  Randolph, who was our most cranky, our most lanky, and our most regal cat, had a 45-minute-long status epilepticus seizure one morning out of the blue while I was changing his water bowl.  Which by the time it was over, resulted in my having to order his euthanasia while two-year-old P was having a tantrum on the floor of the vet's because I wouldn't let her sit on the exam table.  Randolph was such a pistol they wouldn't even let me be there, so my last moment with him was him in an oxygen tent, panting and looking crazed, and me saying, "See you on the other side, buddy."  Before this devolves into a hoky Hallmark thing I want you to know that there is nothing hoky nor Hallmarky about sharing your life with an animal. Not for me, anyway. I have run back into a burning building for these cats. I had sat up with them about a million times, taking temperatures, dripping chicken broth mixed with echinacea down their reluctant throats, petting and consoling.  My animal hospital has a huge client roster and my vet knows me by voice recognition. My cats had some seriously bad things wrong with them -- hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, eiosinophilic granuloma complex, plasmocytic lymphocytic granulomar stomatitis (allergic to own dental plaque); asthma, terminal renal failure (all that was Muppet); megacolon and probably cancer (Eyebrow); diabetes and inflammatory bowel disease (Angel); brain tumor (Randolph). Not to mention all the little stuff in between -- the sniffles and runs. Muppet in particular was allergic to clay litter and plastic. Try avoiding that with a cat. I marched through all of it with them, and I would do it again just to know them.  After the four died in rapid succession, though, I said, "Note to self: never acquire gang of cats in same age bracket ever again."  A lot of people have said that the cats were good practice for taking care of P, with all her special needs. And I have to agree.  But more importantly they were divine training for learning how to love her. To love at all, really. I've always had a problem with it. It's in there, but it gets stoppered up right at the entrance, because I've had such bad things happen to me when I let it out before.  That didn't happen with the cats. I was able to love them extravagantly and indulgently and wear my adoration for them pinned to my overcoat. That was very good practice and divine grace for loving my daughter, when she finally arrived.  You should know that I was reluctant about having a baby, which is why it took me six years of marriage to consider one and nearly nine to actually have one. I was ambivalent. I didn't know how my body would be pregnant (it surprised and delighted me by the ease with which it took to the condition -- once we convinced it that it was possible).  And I didn't know how my mind would be about it -- I lost my mother when I was pretty young, and I had so much unfinished business with that emotionally.  Even now I would say that my greatest fear is that P and I would somehow be prematurely separated, as I was from my mother. My counselor says you don't ever get over that kind of stuff. She says that all those memories live in a part of your brain that's like a reptile -- I think she said it was the amygdyla -- and whenever something happens to trigger it there you are, right back at that moment when you first got burned.  In fact I often thought earlier in my pregnancy,before we knew P was a P that I might like to have a boy, because then I wouldn't have to get my feet stuck in the muck of a mother/daughter relationship again. My own with my mother was so fraught. When the ultrasound technician said, "I'd bet three paychecks that's a girl," I said, "here she comes again." Meaning my mother. And the tech looked at me weirdly. But do you have to explain yourself to ultrasound technicians?  Now that I have my P I wouldn't trade her for riches, fame, glory, even the eternal repose of my soul. It would have to be P for me from the beginning of the world. God knew that.  By the way, when I had the early loss before P was born I often thought that baby might have been a boy. Our boy name was Rhys Christian. It's pronounced  Reese . It's Welsh, obviously, and reminded us of Wales, which we loved when we lived in the UK. We also liked Gareth, which is also Welsh and means spear. I don't think I would use either of those names now, though. My favorite boy name now is Jude. And Julian. Both of which S says are "beat me up and steal my lunch money" names -- as ALa71's friend once coined that phrase. Those are also ALa71's favorites, but I'll bet she'll get a chance to use them before I do.  Despite my apolitical tendencies, you should further know that, after all I went through to bring life into the world, I am rabidly pro-life from the moment of conception, so I grieved that pregnancy as my baby, not just, what the hell do they call it, "the products of conception." And I grieved it hard.  But then P came.  And in the meantime, there were the cats. I'm sorry I'm all over the place here, but it's all a rich tapestry.  Pumbaa the fatboy was the last cat I acquired. I got him from the PetSmart shelter in October of 1996 and I watched him languish there for two weeks before I finally risked my marriage, plunked down sixty dollars in cash, and carted him home (after being tested at a ham-handed vet's for FeLV and FIV).  Every time I went in there -- there he was, his dirty feet hanging out of the cage, his big, emaciated body and giant head. I held him once. He shivered the whole time.  I had to have him, of course. I wasn't smart enough to know in those days that once I touch them, it's over. If I can just look, I can walk away.  "It'll get sick," S predicted, "and cost us a fortune." He was right.  The first time S saw Pumbaa, he called him "lab animal." He was in pretty bad shape, and already sick, but I think the shelter staff kept him on because he was so affable.  When I adopted him, I overheard the kennel guy that supplied the store with animals from the shelter talking to the adoption counselor.  "How many do we need for tomorrow?"  "Five."  "Five? Someone else got adopted? Who?"  "That black and white one."  "The big guy?"  "Yeah. That lady over there just came in at the last second and took him."  "ALL RIGHT!!"  I kept the kennel guy in mind when Pumbaa proceeded to crap all over the place for the next six months. And spray green snotballs at the walls.  A couple people offered to take him, but you know that never pans out. It was that he was supposed to be mine, as usual.  He was SO sick. I had to run a CDC decontam area to keep it away from the other cats. He lived in one room. And then in the basement.  I sweated him and spent a fortune and left work early and caused my boss to pull me aside. She didn't understand that I was battling against death, and I really was.  Back in the day, when I was dabbling in the occult, I had a set of Native American tarot cards, where you could discover your personal "medicine" from the Mesoamerican totems. I invariably pulled the badger card -- and S often calls me "badger" because of my rankly temper. I'll never forget the last line of the guide.   Badger medicine makes for the finest healers , it said,  because they do not give up.     I have used badger medicine on every single person and animal I have ever had to heal, including myself.  I wouldn't give up on Pumbaa -- by the grace of God I got him well, and added another grand to our general burden of owe. And after the other cats died and he got a tumor, I got him well again.  For a while after the other four died, he was our only cat. We moved with him alone, and props to ALa71 for taking him on the day of settlement. You could've kept him! Really!  Cats get freaked in new places, and he kept me up half the night. I found him in the morning, sleeping in the bathroom sink.  The vets give me a hard time about his weight, but after the initial illness which caused such severe malabsorption, his metabolism burns about one calorie a day. He's a fat cat. I worry about it, but every day he's had since October of 1996 has been gravy. And we are the gravy train. We have nothing to feel bad about in that department. It's a life well lived, however long it lasts.  I started to miss the other cats and think about a pal for Pumbaa -- he was lonely and under my feet constantly. You know I work for a cat shelter and know cat maniacs, so I could've had a kennelful in a day should I have given the word. But I held off. Something stopped me . . .the grief? The knowing what goes wrong? The knowing that you will get a cat when you least expect it, because cats know who's an easy mark?  I think it was the third thing.  One day last fall I was leaving for my insanely early church service, and out of the swirling mist stepped what appeared to be a large, confused, white and gray male kitten which began to drink from a puddle.  "Christ," I muttered.  I went inside and got it something to eat, which I took care to walk a half a block away, because I didn't want the neighbors reporting me for being nice to an animal.  And then I didn't see the kitten again.  One day there he was, sashaying down the driveway. I was on the phone with ALa71 and I said, "oh, God, there's that cat again . . .it looks so  skinny !"  "They do that on purpose," she said. "They have like five houses each that feed them, and in between they suck in their guts so someone else feels sorry for them and feeds them."  I laughed. But I was still worried.  That night, S took out the trash with a handtruck as he often does -- he pulls it out of the garage -- in rowhouses you have to walk the trash from the back to the front, practically all the way around the block if you're in the middle.  I just drag the cans on the ground when I do it, but that's neither here nor there.  Then Halloween came. I was having a lot of insomnia in those days, so I was up in the night, and I heard a cat crying.  A female in heat, I thought. It sounded far away. I didn't hear it again.  Monday came. S came in when he was supposed to be leaving.  "Goddamn it," he said, but his eyes looked scared. "There's a cat in the garage -- and I don't know how long it's been in there."  My heart started pounding. There was no food or water in there! When had it gotten in? It had to be at least five days since we last opened that garage. How was it alive? "Was it the gray and white?" I said.  "I don't know," he said. "I have to look . . .agh, I don't feel like dealing with this now!"  I heard the garage open.  "Kitty in garage?" P asked.  "Wait, Daddy's seeing about the kitty."  Pumbaa, me and P stood at the back door.  There was the giant kitten. I quickly got it something to eat -- I'll never forget the sounds it made when it ate. Just desperate sounds.  "Don't feed it too much," S said. "Leave some food out for it."  "Leave food!" I said. "It's our fault it's in here . . .is it a male? Do you see dingleberries?"  "No dingleberries," he said.  "Okay, then it's a girl -- get it in a cage."  "Rose, I don't want to deal with this now."  I thought, be a good wife, be a good wife. "Okay," I said. "Your call."  We tried to let the cat go. She wouldn't leave. She kept trying to get in the house.  And that is how Fairycat -- her real name is Pixie -- who found her way into our garage for the better part of a week and nearly died of thirst and hunger -- came to spend 10 days at a vet getting better and running up a tab. Then came home to live with us.  And so the cycle begins again.

      So I was forced to watch fifteen minutes of an Elvis movie retrospective on PBS while I ate my honey nut cheerios.  I love when Elvis sang with ol' blue eyes after he got out of the Army. But there my understanding of him begins and ends. I have also always thought that Priscilla was beautiful.  I didn't realize Elvis was in  so many  movies. And that:  1. one of the movies was called  Clambake .  2. the fonts they used in sixties movie advertising were so heinous.  3. Ann-Margret did such weird dancing in  Viva Las Vegas.

      I just don't see why the man can't wash a saucepan without it becoming a major thing.  He asks why I have to make a big deal about it. He claims he washes the saucepan "all the time," without a peep, yet since most of my waking hours are spent washing that same saucepan, how . . . ?  He does do a lot of chores around here -- I'll admit to that. Maybe more than most men, blah blah blah. And I am home all day. So saucepans should be my domain, I suppose. No matter who melted margarine in them and left them all caked with gluten-free brownie batter. But he had the gall to show me how to clean the bathroom mirror the other day, which amazed me since it was the first time in our marriage he had ever done it! The man has enjoyed a scrubbed commode for the past thirteen years! I have a PhD in bathroom mirror washing!  Okay, don't mention the mildew wars -- they're a special case.  I intend to go investigate whether the saucepan has been washed. Would anyone care to wager on this?  And by the by, I am  not  too tightly wound.  Update, 7:15 PM: He washed the saucepan. To spite me, I'm certain.

      . . . with his brand-new digital camera. Special batteries, USB port connectors, and various waterproof carry cases were also mentioned.  He even took a video unbeknownst to me of me putting up P's hair. Which he then forced me to watch on the television.  Why can't I hire a body double? Why?  Thank you, Visa, for making him so happy.

      I nearly wore my miraculous medal, but at the last minute took it off and put on instead a rose quartz.  Last year: on fire for the Lord, totally convicted, acquisitions editor loved my pitch, people rapt on my every word at lunch (plate of mixed nachos, two pieces of cake.) Thinking: this is what I want to do. That's right. I'm right where I need to be, the angels are singing in heaven, I can walk the walk and talk the talk.  In between: two novels written, proposed, rejected.  This year: somewhere between "Lord I Lift Your Name on High" (which I sang in harmony, my old praise-band way) and the first session on why you have to title your book something that will grab a reader's eyes from a spine on the shelf, my stomach knotted itself and knotted itself and knotted itself once more. Then tied itself into a bow.  I felt so sick I walked out of the first session.  In my bag, I had a piece of paper on which were two appointments, one with an agent at 2:15 and one with an acquisitions editor at 3:45 for a well-known Christian romance line. I called S from a cloister.  "What's the matter?" he said. "Is it dead boring?"  "My stomach hurts," I said.  "Do you want to come home?"  "Yes. I need to go forfeit these appointments so someone else can have them."  "Okay."  "The praise was good. I loved the singing."  "Was it the best damn praise you ever sang?"  "It was."  "Good."  My stomach untied its bow and started working on the knots.  He said he'd pick me up after he got the baby from school, around 12:30. I went and sat by the duck pond for a while, where I talked to a mom whose daughter wants to be a writer.  "She wants to write novels for a living," she told me brightly.  "Her and everyone else," I said. But I wasn't too discouraging: I told her there were plenty of ways to write professionally and I had even done some of them myself.  I ran into a friend I met last year who has the same name as me. We sat together during the praise and the devotions, which were wonderful. A man preached on how humans and sheep are really alike, a psychological reading of the 23rd psalm. Another guy led us in a military-style chant about how all agents have fangs. That was funny.  My friend said to me, "I read some of your blog."   Busted!  "It's very secular," I told her carefully.  "Some forbidden words there," she said, smiling warmly. "But beautifully written."  That heartened me.  There were African handicrafts for sale, made by refugee women. I bought P a bag of assorted cotton animals, plus their acacia tree and their waterhole.  What is your book title? the seminar leader asked me.  " The Deliverance of Grace ," I said.  "Grace is a real buzzword now," she said.  I tried to sit alone at lunch -- I had to dash in and out -- but amazingly a lady I met last year sat next to me. I admitted to everyone at the table I had two novels that I wanted to hurl onto the dung heap.  "I haven't written anything all year," she confided to me. "I wasn't sure if I'd even come. I don't have any appointments this time."  I felt like telling her, you can have the two I just gave up.  Another woman said, "I feel moved to write a historical Christian romance. There's so much trash out there." Meaning in secular publishing. Which I have also written. Which I also attended a conference for, once upon a time.  I almost sprayed my soup all over the table.  After lunch (small piece of broiled haddock, mini quiche, soup, Pepsi and cake), I headed back to the duck pond.  A large white goose waddled up and ate an ant from the bench. Mallards lay in the grass with soft eyes like labradors. A high spray from a fountain fanned out over the pond. My head was in a thousand places, still is. Is what I'm writing here precious in God's sight? Is the rest posturing and this real? Is this wrong? What are the odds that someone in that building would actually publish me? Do I want to be published in that way? Am I proud of this? What would they say if they saw it?  I looked up the bank -- I couldn't tell if the groundcover were weeds or deliberate planting, but there it was, being ruffled in the breeze by God's wind just like the more important trees surrounding it. Leaves cascaded down branches as slim as silver circlets. I heard snippets of conversation of people walking to a late lunch -- "he had that Baptist heart going in, and here was this book, trying to be Biblical" -- "I was in medicine before, but it was all I could do before I realized --"  Those trees didn't need any words. Those ducks weren't writers. Those weeds weren't looking to get published. Yet they were just as relevant to God's creation as anyone or anything else.  God, why did You put me here? This year I have more questions than answers, and here I am raw. But You know me better than I know myself. In You I'm free.  A damselfly landed on my wrist and I paused before I brushed it off.  Grace is a real buzzword now.

      It was just so  sad . And there was no way not to get triggered. I yelled at S before we left to please hurry up, because the babysitter (Sandy) was waiting on us, and we were already delayed by this insane hailstorm that I thought was going to break the skylight in the Mildew Kingdom.  Annoyed with my nagging, S fired back some choice words -- if I live to be a hundred I will not understand why it takes someone who has a quarter inch of hair and no makeup to put on twenty minutes longer than me to get ready -- and we were chastened by our daughter in the car who said, "Mommy and Daddy, why can't you stop fighting and just  love each other ."  He said I should've stayed home. I said no, the right thing is to go and feel awkward and try somehow to carry some of the load of the pain that the loved ones are feeling. Everything is woefully inadequate. Particularly when people die suddenly, as this man did.  Another storm broke just as we arrived. It was beyond belief. We couldn't even get out of the car for the lightning. We waited until the rain tapered a bit. He dropped me off, parked and took his chances. His friend was happy to see us. His wife whispered to me, "It's been too long." It has.  There were pictures of the deceased with his family, of a life well lived. That made me wistful and sad at the same time.  I said to S these places are amazing with their funereal furnishings and elaborate carpeting. They're all the same, so Victorian. But with an energy in them that's borne out of grief. There's no way to make it leave. It's like a mustiness in the air.  I told S when I stayed at the benedictine monastery I had never felt such a sense of prayer and peace that literally seemed to seep from the walls. I didn't think it was just my mind imbuing it with some emotion. It was there. These kinds of things are present. They remind us of how circumstances can change in a heartbeat.

       Below is a list of occupations that I either considered or was urged to consider by those who know me. Good thing I haven't done any of them, or I wouldn't be sitting here in the Rowhouse entertaining you. I never wanted to be a career woman, by the way. I just wanted a job. I never wanted to do anything so rarified that I wouldn't be able to go back to typing for seven bucks an hour if I had to. And that's the God's truth.      The Convent.   Rationale:  Because I would get to spend more time with God and never have to decide what to wear, and someone else would pay my rent and tell me what to do. Plus, I would never have to worry about or clean up after a man.  Mitigating Factor:  I couldn't bring my DH Lawrence books.   Ornamental Fruit Carving.   Rationale:  Who doesn't want to make a radish into a rose? Or use a chainsaw on a block of ice? Or make a bird of paradise out of a potato?  Mitigating Factor:  This specialized area of chefdom requires going to cooking school, where bad-tempered chefs yell at you all day and you have to make an omelet with no brown on it. You also have to be able to carve up an entire pig. No go.    Microbiologist.    Rationale:  There is nothing more fun that looking through the lens of a microscope and seeing something twirling around on a slide.  Mitigating Factor:  Having to touch germs in hazmat areas.   Doctor.   Rationale:  Use of vast hypochondriacal medical knowledge and plucky interpersonal skills.  Mitigating Factor:  Math. Unsteady hands. Paying my lab partner to carve up the fetal pig while I averted my gaze.   Nurse.   Rationale:  Great money, cute uniforms, and lots of bustling back and forth taking care of people.  Mitigating Factor:  Bedpans.   ROTC.    Rationale:  Get fit. Be disciplined. See the world.    Mitigating Factor:  Pushups.    Teacher.   Rationale:  Summers off. Imparting knowledge of favorite subject. Satisfaction of knowing you're shaping the future.  Mitigating Factor:  Lack of personal authority. Students who don't care to know what you want to tell them.   Lawyer.   Rationale:  Wealth and prestige. Crisp designer wardrobe.  Mitigating Factor:  Abject boredom. To me, laws are like cars. If they run, then I'm happy, and if they don't, then it's someone else's job to figure out why not.   Famous Author.   Rationale:  Bookcase of own titles. Picture of self in veiled hat looking mysterious on back. Strangers coming up to you in malls.  Mitigating Factor:  Lack of celebrity.

      Another thing that's not in the stay-at-home handbook: the pocket of time.  I just made 4 new navigation bars in photoshop for a new template for one of my jobs, and I'm not going to pull overtime this week -- there's too much going on. So that's that.  Roommate and daughter coming this PM. Must wipe filth out of rowhouse bathroom and vacuum chips from living room carpet. But only 11:43 now, they won't be here till 1:30.  My blood sugar could use a boost, so I ate a mini muffin --  one , okay!  Viewing tonight and weather going to be cataclysmic -- hail, Satan in a chariot, etc. Just my luck. I am rethinking going. Will they whisper about me if I'm not there? S has to go, I don't. I have gone to (calculates) around six or seven funerals without him over the years -- he always has to work.  Conference tomorrow. Feeling totally existentialist nihilist about it. Don't even feel like taking proposals or business cards. Want to beg off any meetings I have with agents or editors. Practically feel like sitting by duck pond all day at Christian College with my rosary clutched in my hand (if they knew I wore a miraculous medal, I wouldn't even be permitted to go. Someone was talking to me last year about something there and I said, "Oh, is that person Catholic?" and they replied, "No, she's saved.")  That kind of thing pisses me off. Who's to say? The Catholics think they're the only ones in heaven -- you know the joke about how you have to walk past their room quietly in the hall. Fundamentalists think the same thing.  I am interested in the fact that God appears to be expectorating me into this atmosphere when I have no desire to be there. I am sure there will be some surprise awaiting me there.  So anyway, here I am sitting with a pocket of time -- just a couple of minutes -- before I have to start on the next thing. The problem is, when you have it, you just feel like staring at the wall. Or going to sleep. An idle mind is the devil's workshop.  Or so they say. If you can figure out who "they" are.

      I've been thinking about death a lot lately, and no wonder. A couple of weeks ago my dad's ninety-five year old aunt died -- he had just gone to her birthday party.  There was a little girl who gained national attention running a lemonade stand for pediatric cancer research even as she fought her own battle with the disease for seven years. She died last week, and even though I didn't know her, I felt for her parents in a way that only parents can feel for other parents. I thought about her, and them, a lot.  Then S's best friend's dad died suddenly last week. We have that viewing tonight.  Yesterday ALa71 called me and told me a childhood neighbor had suicided -- well, whether it was accidental or not is in question.  So all these departures swirling around, all these moments that are the final moment when everything else ceases to matter.  I blithely go along trying to think about the dishes and the mildew, but it triggers me badly on some level. It always does.  It's a sad fact that we often spend the second half of our lives living  without  the people who had so much influence over the first half, even as new people come to fill our lives. As we get older, it just gets more problematic -- as the natural order of things renders its judgement all throughout all our connections.  Which brings me to my grandmother, who was dear, dear, dear to me, and not so much like a grandmother -- she wasn't a sweet old granny -- as a soul mate and confidante whom I loved with a singular love bordering on passion and for whom I had a deep understanding.  My mother's life was essentially tragic -- as my dad would say, ten pounds of shit in a five pound bag. Her parents had no money, and her dad fought in the war and got TB during it, making her mom essentially a single mother.  Since they offered to help her mom out, my mother was raised by her beloved grandparents. She had a chlorophyll allergy that made her skin so bad that not only did she have to live at the shore to get away from everything green, she had radiation treatments on her skin to rid herself of the rash as a girl. This therapy may or may not have contributed to her cancer later on.  She married the captain of the football team when she graduated at 17. She divorced him a year later because she said he drank too much. Then she married my dad, and they popped out the three macho mutants and magical me.  Then she was given a death sentence when she was 29 years old and a little lump she felt in her breast turned out to be massive malignancy throughout her entire chest and underarm.  She lived the sentence for 14 years, which was unprecedented in those years. But even more importantly, she lived it while holding the phone about four feet away from her ear while her mother jabbered on through it, pausing only occasionally when she heard the jabbering cease to put it back on her ear and murmur, "Mmm, yes, Mother."  Their relationship was like that.  Strained. Polite. Simmering with old resentments. On some levels, real love and devotion but on some level two ships passing in the night.  I had no such compunctions about my dear Nannie. I adored her.  They say things skip a generation. If that's the case, then all the camaraderie that my mother and grandmother should have had repackaged itself and presented itself to my grandmother and me.  How were Nannie and I alike? How were we  not  alike? My mother was practical, hardened, private. She took about nine thousand secrets to her grave. She whispered to me once, "don't tell anyone when you have your period. Hide the evidence and make no mention of it."  As if!  Everyone  must know when I have my period. It's good for sympathy muffins. I practically hang a banner. I hear the neighbors murmuring, "Didn't she tell us she only wears those black shorts when she has her period? Oh, God, Mike -- she's  looking  at us! Quick, glance over there and act engrossed. Then maybe she won't come over here. Oh,  shit ! Here she comes."  My mother is scowling down from heaven because of this blog.  My grandmother, meanwhile, is probably trying to find someone to teach her how to use the internet so she can read it and comment.  There is nothing I won't tell anyone, you see. The period example is extreme, and not totally true. No. Not totally. No! But Nannie, my grandmother, was famous for shouting my personal and delicate health problems into the ear of her kindly neighborhood pharmacist, so here I was, seventeen and nubile, with guys I would otherwise look to impress getting an earful about my bowel prep kit I needed for the test I had tomorrow.  "You say this one has  two  enemas? Well, when does she take the  laxatives ?"  Nannie had no volume control. Her neighbor used to beat on the wall while Nannie was on the phone.  I talk quietly on the phone, usually. I'm always afraid someone's listening in. I wouldn't want the general public to know all my personal problems, I wouldn't start a private website that anyone could look at recalling conversations and detailing my birth experience, I wouldn't do anything of the sort!  So I got my grandmother's sense of full disclosure. But the difference is, I worry about it afterward.  Well, okay, maybe I did get a little of my mother's sense of privacy.  My mother shipped me down to my grandmother's innumerable times. (A letter I found that she'd sent to my brother while he was away: "Rose is visiting your grandmother this week. Rah! Rah! Rah!") And after my mother was gone and I lived in the Disney Castle from Hell, I went there very, very, very, very, very often. Often enough for my toothbrush there to have more miles on it than my toothbrush at home.  Oh, God, I could write a book about this. And this isn't the only time I have to post on her. Some readers have complained about the length of my posts.  I will tell you what the title of the post means. Sitting in Nan's kitchen eating toast together when I was eight years old, we heard a radio commercial for Texas Instruments calculators. In it, a man was trying to sell his daughter to a shiek. The daughter came with a pet elephant.  "She's great, she's wonderful, she's terrific!" the man was saying. "AND she comes with a pet elephant! That's Ruby on the left."  I was not a fat child -- I was built like a stringbean, or maybe a pea pod. But for some reason we loved that commercial and "that's Ruby on the left" stuck. My grandmother called me Ruby for the rest of her life.  And then there were the thousand stories she told, all of which I will probably tell in some form or another, here.  She was my greatest ally, in a way. She tried to step in and be my mother after my mother died and she did a damn good job of it. She used to sing the old song, "I'll be loving you always" to me. She knew what a bundle of anxiety I was, and she used to say, "Don't worry, just put your back up against mine and we'll get through it."  She died of Alzheimer's, stuck up in Vermont with my cousin who swore he'd never put her in a home, but how could he not? She died in a home as many Alzheimer's patients do when they are too ill and too much of a risk to themselves and others to be cared for at home. In the meantime, while she lived at his house, he spent all her money. So I actually didn't see her for the last two years of her life.  My grandmother and I had identical hands -- small, soft and looking incapable of all they needed to accomplish in an average day; at odds with the rest of our appearances.  The last time I saw her, she looked at me quite lucidly, put a ring on my finger she wanted me to have, and took both of my hands into hers.  "Put your back up against mine," she said.

      It occurred to me tonight as I dressed P for bed with her sassy mouth that here was this PERSON standing in front of me, four years old, with a mouth that was sassing me. And I could barely believe it.  My father kept a picture of me on his desk at work until he retired from the police department when I was 16. (He still works, just not for the police department.) In the picture, I was five years old. I remember saying to him, "Dad, why don't you get a new picture? I don't look like that now!"  He said, "There will be an age you will fall in love with and every time you see your child -- no matter how old they are -- they will be that age. They are always that age in your mind."  I liked his idea a lot, but I think it is even more dimensional than one age and one picture. I realized tonight that whatever P says and does, she is a hundred different P's to me. Newborn P, the first time I held her. Baby P, sitting in her bouncy chair. Toddler P, pronouncing cheese "sheesh." Three-year-old P, munching potato chips. Four year old P, talking to me through a puppet. All that history, all at once, which feeds into our joys, our fears, our expectations and our reservations.  I think the reason why we bring such intensity to our parenting roles is because the child literally goes from nothing to everything right before your eyes. From a seed to a stalk to a sapling to a tree. And everything you say or do has the power to influence that transformation. It's a tall order. And you never stop missing the budding and blooming of the previous seasons. You can't hold an afternoon and its sunshine, it just slips from you, and you have to look as hard as you can at it to even approximate one shadow. The seasons pass and there is regret. Even as you look forward to the ones to come.

       urlLink    I asked P what she wanted to be for Halloween and handed her a catalog of costumes that came in the mail today. After flipping past the princesses, unicorns, fairies and ladybugs, this is what she selected. She wanted to know if Faceless Ghouls have teeth.

      P is taking a nap. Preschool moms out there, kindly give me lotus leaves for this accomplishment.  Naps define life for a very long while, but after a while they just make the kid stay up later and sleep worse. First there are four naps. Then there are three. Then two. Then one. Then none.  On a day like today, though, she really needed it. She was plopping down everywhere like a little feather pillow, so I marched her up the stairs, curled up with her in her bed, contemplated sleep myself (I had too much iced tea already today to combat my own fatigue so I'm wired) and waited 2 minutes until she was out cold.  She slept so  badly  last night. Then again, so did I. I got like 3 hours of sleep total. I was actually afraid to operate a motor vehicle this morning, but I told myself I was being a wuss and soldiered on.  P has a big ulcer on her gum that she told neither of us about -- S found it the other night while brushing her teeth. Now, she begs for salt water, which she drinks, which is disgusting, but what are you going to do. I am amazed at how little she complains. She's extremely stoic about pain. But if the ulcer's caused by a virus, then her little body needs a rest.  I asked her if there was anything she wanted to tell me about school today. She usually jabbers the whole time, but she was completely silent. That was okay, "American Pie" was on the radio (after Billy Squier -- twice in one day!) and I just turned up the radio and sang along. I asked if she remembered that I sang that to her as a baby. She replied politely that she did.  Anyway, she said she didn't want to tell me anything about school. She wanted to tell  Daddy . S has been working a lot lately and P is feeling it. She misses him desperately when he's not here.  So, I have about an hour and a half here to use. I should work and probably will. UGHGHGHGH . . .worked in little snippets all morning, sick of work.  Ah! The phone.  Me: Hello? S: Hey, how ya doin? How's your day going? Me: Good. S: Are you on the new phone? Me: Yes. S: Sounds good! ( editor's note: again with the stinking phone!)  Me: So . . . what's going on? S: Well, I should be home normal time . . . it depends . ..  have to see how things go here. ( sound of surgical drills in background ) I'll call you later. Me: Okay.  I would like to report that S is still blaming me for the Haircut Fight of Last Thursday which was entirely his fault. I would also like to report that compared to the length and quantity of his hair yesterday, today he resembles John Kerry at boot camp.

      Gathering courage while brain is ticking. Have to design an emergency ad today for Prestigious Publication -- template already set -- but waiting for insertion order to come through fax, etc. etc. Boss is out of country. This always happens. ......................... Teachers were so nice to P when I dropped her off, I wondered about my earlier vitriol. Still, P leapfrogged all over the room to show them all the gross motor progress we've been making here (we practice balance, jumping, etc. etc.)  Me: Stop hopping all around the classroom! You're going to knock something over. That wouldn't be nice, would it? Her: It would be nice!  She showed the teacher eight different varieties of plastic sealife, distinguished between three types of sharks and described in detail the diet of the manta ray vs. the moray eel. Yet she would not sustain interest to count the creatures.  Maybe she's autistic.  Maybe she's just four.  Maybe I'm too tightly wound.  ............................................  Went to bank, and heard Billy Squier on the radio on the way home. I had switched from Christian radio; I like it on the drive over but after 9 the fire and brimstone people take over, and I don't need to hear that. Rowhouseland has enough brimstone already.  What ever happened to Billy Squier? All at once I was twelve and had a new folder for school that looked like one of his record covers. I recalled him saying how he liked to turn hotel rooms into aquariums. I think it read it in  Circus  or  Hit Parader  back then.  .........................  Radio deejays saying, "You could win a week at the beach if you tell us in so many words what a goody-goody you are."  My ears perked up.  "No one can compete with this lady yesterday, though. She goes to church  seven days a week ."  Does wearing a miraculous medal count toward or against that?  "Anyway," the one deejay said, "I don't think I've been to church seven times in ten years."  "Me either!" the other one said.  When I got home there was a message on the machine asking if I could read at the 8:15 this weekend. Of course I called back and said yes.  ...........................................  Saw a teen mom with a teeny little girl baby in a pack on her chest on the drive home. This was before the deejays and their pious talk.  Got a pang. Wouldn't that be nice -- a little baby again. So tiny. So sweet.  Then I remembered the hell of it and changed my mind.  I was reminded of a poster I had in college. It said, "Whenever I feel like studying, I lie down until the feeling goes away."

      My stomach being my stomach, here I am awake at 2:19.  Dreading taking P to school today. She just woke up crying from a bad dream and I got her settled back down. Why dreading school? Not sure. Indulge me a moment while I explore this a bit.  Firstly, I never believed that P would go to school at all.  Let me back up. Here is P my longed-for baby, and here I am her mama, protecting her beyond anything. Then here I am trying to get her to eat, and that's taking up like two years of her life -- trying to get her to  survive , and not worrying about tumbling classes and Gymboree and playdates. No leisure for that kind of thing.  Then here I am finding out the kid can't be around a drop of milk or a piece of bread or the smell of a peanut, among other things. So that's it. We're home-schooling until she's smart enough to inject herself. Not that I'm thrilled with the notion of having to home-school, but I can rise to whatever occasion.  Then we have her year-interval with the allergist. They actually got blood out of her this year, a miracle. Last year I took her to a lab where the phlebotomist was such a bad stick she nearly broke the sharp off in P's arm, and she didn't get the blood she needed. P was so unbelievably traumatized by that experience that I could barely get her in a doctor's office without her breaking down in a screaming fit.  So this year we took her to a kids' hospital, and S went in with her. Since S has a great deal of experience with pediatric patients, we get the blood.  The results came back and she was even more allergic to everything than before, even on a total elimination diet -- she's never had any of these foods in her diet, apart from whatever miniscule traces were in my milk -- which kicked my ass. I had been praying rosaries against that very thing pretty much every day and had visited two shrines with that specific intention for the saints -- one of whom was St. Jude, patron saint of lost causes, whom I attribute her existence to.  I still think prayers can be answered, though. That sense didn't falter. I just don't believe they're always answered in the way you want them to be. The answer can take a different form. Looking back later, even when your answer isn't painted in the colors you specified, you see extravagant grace working in your life.  Anyway, at the allergist, I started going on about the homeschool plan. He looked at me squarely.  "Homeschooling is a personal decision. But you cannot," he said, "limit this child's life because of your fear."  He had said it before, but this time I listened.  "She needs to be in a preschool," he said, "a couple of times a week -- that's all! With children her own age."  But . . .!  "I can appreciate the severity of her allergies," he said. "She is a  very  allergic child. But we have children more allergic than her in school. Find someone who will work with you. Find them."  So that April afternoon I had two problems.  I had a kid who had never really been around other children.  But who couldn't be around the things that children were constantly eating.  I called a couple of places.  "Well," one said, "we still have peanuts here, but we'll try to keep them away from her."  Not good enough.  I even visited a few.  "I see," said one administrator, "some red flags in her behavior. I'll be keeping an eye on her if she comes here."  How could I explain, how could I explain? She is P. She is little strong-glasses-wearing, nervous-around-food, cautious-around-kids, affable, hyperintelligent P who knows the name of every bug and every flower. How to find a place for her?  I found it at the special-needs preschool.  They made the building nut-free. They still have some of the other allergens around, but they are all trained on the epipen.  She is in the typically developing class, and there was some resistance on her part at first. I had tried to do some mom-and-baby gymnastics type stuff with her, swimming, that kind of thing to get her started. She didn't even know how to be in a class. She was like when people adopt a Greyhound and they don't know how to climb steps because they've never seen them before.  Unfortunately, the way that childcare works nowadays, you have kids that have been there since they were six weeks old, and they're pros, creating an unequal playing field between them and the ones that mommy gave up her career to stay home with, a la P.  The first three weeks, she didn't want to go. She had nightmares every night about a black dog offering her popsicles.  Then all of a sudden, she loved it and looked forward to going.  But her first teacher conference came, and it sucker-punched me.  She goes off task. She won't help clean up. She doesn't jump in and play with the other children. She stares at us, walks away, goes off and draws pictures. That is all she seems to like to do.  I can't explain to those of you who don't have children what those kinds of pronouncements feel like. You want to scream, explain it away, take your kid and go and never go back.  Yet you also want to give these professionals the chance to do their job and help educate your child in the best way they know how.  This also triggered my own long-dormant feelings around my early education. From the very first, with my people-pleaser of a brain, I was prodigious, a brown noser, not someone who walked entirely to the beat of a different drum -- I walked to the regular drum, just with some extra steps to the beat.  P makes the drums out of paper and tissue boxes then steals all my kitchen utensils and plays them in the living room.  Anyway, at the conference the teacher was like, why don't you get her developmentally assessed? It's a phone screening then a play evaluation. We want to make sure she has all the right supports, because if she is unready for kindergarten  she may lose all the skills she already has.     This chilled me to the marrow, and it also made me furious.  "The last time I went to a multidisciplinary team," I told the teacher, "they were recommending a feeding tube full of formula that would have made her anaphylax. Needless to say, I took their advice under advisement and threw their report in the trash as soon as I got home."  They'll just play with her, she said.  You think a kid who was in OT for fourteen months can't recognize a play evaluation and know it for what it is? This is P we're talking about here. No thanks.  I couldn't stand it though. It was stuck in my brain, so I called. It's a city agency, so I went through the motions and had to wait for them to call back.  The woman was lovely. I had actually found, downloaded and administered the exact evaluation to P that screened her for delay -- and she scored perfectly within range.  The evaluator said, "Why are they requesting this?"  "She won't jump in and play with the other kids apparently."  "Didn't you say this is her first experience with group socialization?"  Yes.  "Why don't they just give her more time?"  From your mouth to God's ears.  "I want to tell you, Mrs. Ordinary Household Word, I seldom find in my work a mother who is as devoted to her child and who is as delighted with her. Your advocacy on her behalf is truly something to feel proud of. Enjoy your daughter. Let her grow into the person she is meant to be."  Yeah, that and all my other meager accomplishments in this life which add up to a whole lot of assache.  I happily handed the teacher the discharge papers from the evaluation. I'm sure she was skeptical, but I told her in so many words that it would be a cold day in hell before they slap some behavioral diagnosis on my little happy allergic firecracker of a girl just so they can meet their ridiculous quotas and give referrals to a bunch of PhDs trying to justify their jobs.  As you can imagine things are a bit strained at times for me there.  I asked her again about P's progress last week.  Well, she's off task sometimes, she said. We're watching her and giving her the supports she needs. She was mad at me today. She wouldn't pass a glass of apple juice to another child.  Let me tell you something about education right now. There's all this inclusivity, but the standards for behavior are so goddamned rigid it's amazing that anyone makes it through without being drugged out on ritalin or sitting next to their own personal keeper. I'm serious.  I said to her finally, number one, she doesn't pass or share anyone's food at home. We do not do that. You have to understand that there is a social aspect to anaphylactic allergies.  Well, she needs to do it here, she said. Not with things she's allergic to, of course.  Is she playing with the kids better? That's what you flagged before.  Well, yes. But sometimes she'll ask another child to play, and the other child won't hear her and I have to tell her to ask again before her feelings get hurt.  Well, that's the other child's fault then, for not hearing her? She's making the overture, at least.  I suppose so, yes.  What about the drawing? Is she going off and drawing all the time?  No, she's doing much better with that.  See, she is making progress. Let me ask you something: do you  like  her? Do you like having her in your class? Are you going to kick her out, or what?  Oh no! She's a lovely little girl. You just gave me chills, asking that. I've been doing this for twenty years. It's what I do.  Well, I do best with lots of feedback. Because I can tell her how to act at school and she will listen to me. But I need to know what's going on. And I need to hear good stuff too.  Of course.  I asked her, by the way -- I asked P why she didn't jump right in and play with the other kids. She looked at me and said shyly, trying so hard to do what was right, my poor sweetheart, "Mommy, I was just waiting my turn like you said!"  Can a bottle of Ritalin squelch that kind of compassion and sensitivity? Not as long as I draw breath on this earth it won't.

      The more tired P gets, the more rammy she is and the more difficult to put to bed. Yet the entire time she insists she isn't tired. She razzed, yelled, twirled, porcupined, armadilloed and basically made her bedtime routine as unbearable as possible for all concerned.  S got her upstairs, but he went off for his haircut so I directed the second act.  Then I finally got her down and went in to shower, and when I came back to check on her she was all crying and snotty.  Why are you crying? (hands P handkerchief -- blow! blow!)  There's too much noise in here!  I'll turn the airconditioner down.  I sat with her again. She jabbered on about various discomforts and injustices for about forty seconds and fell asleep so instantaneously that I wondered whether she actually  had been  asleep, and a cranky sleepwalker had been battling with me that whole time in her stead.  Unfortunately I can't outlast her that much in the sleep sweepstakes. She wears me out like a marathon. Off to bed.

      I am sitting on hold with a credit card company. The first hold was 13 minutes and they disconnected me. This one is now (pauses to check) 8:53.  I have a habit of verbally skewering customer service representatives when provoked unduly. This hold music is panflutes and some very serious world music drumming and it is calming me somewhat.  Apologies to anyone who is a customer service representative who might be reading this; I am really quite nice until you tell me whatever I am calling to discuss with you is not your fault. If you work for the company, then, no, I am not saying it is  personally  your fault; and I will gladly make that distinction and bid you peace. I know you are a person with mouths to feed and bills to pay, just like me.  However, in your professional capacity, you  are  a representative of whatever grand conglomerate whose fault it is, and I have to complain to someone. So I select you.  In this case . . . it's not their fault that they put the wrong damn name on my card, is it?  OMG! They just disconnected me  again.     At my old company, a human always answered the phone. We might put you on hold and come back after a minute or two, but we answered it. For two summers and whenever they needed someone to pinch hit, even at the end of my decade-long tenure there, I answered that phone and fielded all of that ire, confundity and bliss. Sometimes ten lines were going at once. So I know of what I speak. And I did it as compassionately as I could. I was not a cog. I would get off my ass and personally handle things for people. And they were dead grateful. Unlike  some  whom you encounter.  I know they are limited sometimes in what they can do -- the nadir of my professional life was a temp job where I generated foreclosure notices all day long for a mortgage company. I had to write down when I went to the bathroom and when I got back. So I know what it's like to be under the corporate jackboot, too.  But they can manage to connect a call without losing it . . . can't they? I ask so little.  I think I need to use behavior modification techniques at this moment and permit S to handle this. The vein in my forehead is starting to throb alarmingly.  Deep, cleansing breath. This does not matter right now.  Ah . . . serenity now.   Update:  I can never leave well enough alone, so I started doing some updates on the cat shelter and just called and waited again.  I got a lovely man with a rumbly, mesmerizing voice who handled everything and made the world right again. I moaned on about the inconvenience in a distressed damsel sort of way and he made all the appropriate condolences. I was half in love with him by the time I hung up. Problem solved. New card en route.

      Imagine my delight upon stepping on the scale this morning and finding myself fully  six pounds  lighter than at a comparable moment last week!  Okay, I did have a bilious attack last night but that can't account for all of it.  I know people always say this, but my struggle with  avoir dupois  is truly glandular in nature. My womanly, traditional, non-Paris-Hilton-like shape is because my body doesn't use insulin correctly. If you want to be put to sleep by the fan of the slide projector I have here, I can explain the entire metabolic feedback mechanism to you.  Badgeley Mischka couture aside, it's incredibly easy to gain and nearly impossible to lose weight, even with power workouts and massive deprivation. My endocrinologist's mantra, which he does not guarantee will work, is "1200 calories a day, weight watchers and an hour of exercise every day for the rest of your life!" You can never waver.  Yeah, buddy. That'll happen.  Last time I was there, I said to him, "Can you guarantee if I do all that that I won't get hit by a bus?"  He said he couldn't.  "What's twelve hundred calories? A bowl of grape nuts and a banana?"  Just about, he said.  Anyway, the drug I'm on made me lose weight the last time I was on it, before P was born, mainly because it made me so frigging sick I couldn't eat. Still, the results were welcome.  This time, my clever stomach knew how to eat around it, mostly.  Since the blog, I have been more down here, and less in the cabinet. It's easy to munch all day when you're home. One more benefit of blogging, I must say.  I do confess to being an emotional eater. There is nothing on this planet that can't be rendered brighter by the infusion of enough mini muffins.  Dr. Phil would have a field day with me. There is no limit to the number of things he'd tell me to "get real" about in my life. Still, I'm sticking with the scale on this one today.

      On the bad day last week, when S took off, part of the argument was that I thought S needed a haircut and he didn't feel like getting one because he wanted to "relax" and be a defiant ten-year-old boy whose mom can't tell him what to do.  But, WOULDN'T YOU KNOW IT, he's got somewhere to go this week where he has to look groomed -- he just found out -- and no time to get a haircut in. He's going to have to fit it in somewhere.  He said, "Why didn't I listen to you last week?"  Why indeed.

      1. I will throw up wherever and whenever I wish and the lady and man will clean it up and still pet me.  2. I will sit and watch with a rapt expression while the lady cleans my latrines and as soon as she is done I will go and christen them again.  3. I will dip my filthy feet in the water dish while I drink so the lady has to keep changing my water.  4. I will scatter my crunchies everywhere.  5. The lady will clean it up.  6. When I am sick, the lady will know.  7. It will cost a lot of money to fix me.  8. I will always get sick around Christmas. Preferably on Christmas itself. Even when the lady took care to put me on a warm quilt in her bedroom, not feed me leftovers, shoo me from the shiny tree, and play nice music for my comfort while people were downstairs getting loud and clanking bottles around.  9. The man will speak in a booming voice about removing me from the house whenever I get sick. He will go on and on about how WE CAN'T AFFORD THE DAMN THING ANYMORE. The lady will cry and sulk until the man relents.  10. Or else the lady will just take me to the doctor and have them fix me up like new while the man isn't home.  11. I will get really fat and no amount of $20-a-bag prescription diet will help me lose weight.  12. Whatever I need -- pills, insulin shots, enemas, echocardiograms -- the lady will find a way to do it for me.  13. The man will rant, "We will not pay  any more money  to keep this animal!"  14. But they will. The man will even give me my needles.  15. I will sleep on their pillows. I never play with the expensive toys they buy me, preferring instead little bits of trash. I will sharpen my claws to rapier points on their only nice piece of furniture, over and over again.  16. I will get the lady's favorite sweater so hairy she'll never be able to wear it again.  17. When I get too near the lady, she sneezes and her eyes itch, but she still kisses me.  18. The little girl is a pleasant if demonic playmate. She's rather like a mad scientist.  19. I will pee on the lady's favorite book, and she will clean each page and dry it in the windowsill.  20. No matter how much the man rants, he still cuddles and plays fetch with me and speaks to me in a sweet voice whenever the lady is out of earshot.  21. When I have freeloaded for numerous years, and my body starts to give out, the lady will know first. She will have to convince the man that it's time, and even though he never seemed to want me, it is  he  who will not want to let me go. The lady will have to make him do it. At the doctor, he will pet me and talk to me until I fall asleep.  22. And no matter how much they complained while I was here, when my spirit is twining around the chairs in their new house, I will still see my picture everywhere, and I will still hear them speak my name with love and joy.

      P is not speaking to me directly today -- she is speaking about herself via a dinosaur puppet which is on her hand, in the third person.  As in, "P would like breakfast now. She wants to eat fresh chocolate chip cake."  I am to direct all conversation to the puppet, not to her.

      I have this little thing on my right arm, like a patch of dry skin about 2 mm wide that's been there for like a year, and when I notice it I pick at it and it bleeds, and then like two months go by and it gets dry again and I pick it again and so on.  I go to the dermatologist every year -- one of my brothers gets skin cancer, not the really bad kind -- and she's a tiny, lovely woman who looks over the whole of my person with a magnifying glass and then I go back and she removes this or that mole. It's the mediterranean skin, and my antipathy to sunscreen.  Anyway, back to this patch, now I'm totally obsessed about it because I showed it to S and he analyzed it gravely for a moment and said, "have someone look at it." I hate when he does this. Then I am automatically dying and making sure to leave a list of my favorite hymns to play at my memorial service.  Then I am on google looking at pictures of melanoma and some of the most disgusting pictures you will ever see are they.  It wouldn't be such a big deal if there weren't a 3-month waiting list to see the dermatologist. I already have my October appointment, so I might as well hang tough.  I guess I've revealed that I am a hypochondriac. I am.  My skin is a mess, generally. One time a friend at work (she lives in England now and reads this blog) touched my arm and said incredulously, "oh my God, your skin is so soft, it feels like my grandma's!" I loved that sweet little compliment and have always treasured it.  I do have extremely soft skin. It's one of the few nice things I got saddled with in this semi-functioning body of mine. (Body Factory Workers in heaven: "Well, her hormones will malfunction entirely, but here, slap some of this nice skin on her, there you go.")  I also have insane allergies (the apple doesn't fall far from the tree with P) and get eczema -- between P and me, there will be no smallpox shots in this house.  I also bruise easily -- remember my black forearms when I had the baby, I didn't write there that I blew two more IVs and BOTH of my arms were pitch black from elbow to wrist -- they ran all kinds of blood tests on me. It's partly from the steroid spray and inhalers I'm on for my allergies and asthma.  I took myself off the inhaler, and it improved. They're constantly running platelet counts on me and making me think I'm dying. Amazingly, I have a quite robust number of platelets. After the baby, they did a bleed time and the girl was like, "Why are you here? You have the fastest bleed time I've ever done." And I said, "Because I bruise like a peach."  So okay, I'm the princess and the pea, I'm too soft for this world, but once I get it in my head something's wrong with me it's hard to shut it off. It's a scar, right? It's a scar. And even if it isn't a scar, what else could it likely be? Okay, squamous cell carcinoma, but even that is unlikely to pick me off. As ALa71 says when I lament that I'm dying, "God wouldn't be that kind."  This, by the way, is my hundreth post.

      My sensitive constitution is reconstituting itself this evening, much to my chagrin. So I don't feel like writing a book but I do feel like writing. If it seems disjointed, you have permission to blame my intestines. I know I am! .............................  Me (reading  Parade,  my source for celebrity dish): It says here that Prince has become a Jehovah's witness.  S: He didn't know not to answer the door. ..........................  P (after bath, while getting dried off): I'll take your heart away! Poof!  Me: If I don't have a heart, I can't love you.  P (visibly upset): No?  Me: Well, I love you with my heart. So I need one.  P: Okay, I give it back then. Your heart! Poof! You love me. ..........................  I hate Sunday nights and always have. I think it's kind of a death of possibility thing. Monday is coming, and there's nothing you can do.  My Mondays are pretty tame -- I deliberately don't schedule anything on them except appointments if necessary. P won't be in school Mondays, even when she goes three days this fall. But they are still Monday, even when you stay home. ............................  I still haven't watched Cold Mountain even though I bought it about a month ago. Maybe I'll just send it to my AdoptAPlatoon soldier. I want to see it, but I don't. I don't understand why the leads in a Civil War movie aren't played by American actors.  I know Renee Zellweger is American. She is the only person who redeems it. ...........................  Went to the playground today with cousin Maidink and her baby and P. It's the one like two streets away, and it's always so menacing. I usually drive to better ones.I don't know. The people there are a rougher type. I'm always afraid someone's going to beat the shit out of me.  Last time I was there two men were having a shouting match over the monetary result of a pick-up basketball game -- and the one man kept his funds in a Crown Royal velveteen liquor bag. As soon as that heated up, we beat feet, before anyone started brandishing anything.  Apart from the bag of burned trash by the curb (" that  eliminated some evidence!" said Maidink) and the eau du dog dirt, I was pleased to discover there weren't many people there.  P loved it all, of course. One girl who glommed onto P had a big sister with a mouth full of sunflower seeds -- she kept loading them in, but she only spit out the occasional shell. Her mouth was as stuffed as a chipmunk's. It was very odd. The little girl made me take care of her, loading her into swings and so on. The sister appeared to be quite out of it. It was not really what I wanted to do.  Playgrounds are different than they used to be. My mom used to just set me loose and say, "See you later!" I would obviously never do that with P, but then there is the further fraught situation of when kids do get in their little squabbles and so on, the parents have to kind of run diplomacy for the whole thing, and then there's the meta-level of observing everyone else's parenting . . . a pain in the ass all around.  I have it doubly hard because every kid is usually toting an open container of something P can't eat (cf. the sunflower seeds) and I have to police the equipment for bits and pieces. P actually remembered a piece of melted candy we saw on this playground several months ago. She got nervous. I told her the rats had most probably eaten it in the interim.  A little boy was riding one of those barely-street-legal mini motorcycles, helmetless, around and around the street hockey court, with his dad in observance. I was a nervous wreck for him.  Some teen girls came and visited their teen-girl mom friend and her baby, sashaying and posturing all along. They had hard eyes already, and their hair was pulled and pinched and tamed so sharply, and they couldn't've been more than sixteen. Their clothes were tight and uncomfortable-looking. Their mouths were pinched that mean way, and I thought, my God, don't try to act so tough. Life will toughen you up soon enough. Stay soft as long as possible. You'll wish later that you had.

      Yesterday, in the car, S was musing whether he would remember the mountains of Alaska if he ever chanced to see them again. He was born there and lived there until he was five.  I said I'd bet he would. I don't think things like that ever disappear from you completely.  Similarly with me, since this blogging odyssey began. I've had to feign a modicum of intelligence and wit to hopefully hold your interest, so I've clawed back through the years of dirty diapers and vacuous pregnant and nursing mother brain and corporate lemmingdom.  Way back to my education, back to when I needed this thing between my ears for something besides calculating how much laundry detergent to use on a given load.  I am frankly amazed at how much I remember.  When I started the blog I wanted some pithy quote to represent the whole thing, so I went digging back through my few classics that aren't in boxes someplace in the garage, and I figured DH Lawrence it would have to be, since DH Lawrence was my spiritual guide for years.  The only book I had in the actual rowhouse was  Lady Chatterley's Lover , and my college copy, too, covered with highlighter.  So I went through the introduction and found the quote that you see at the top of this blog. Here is the whole quote, from a letter Lawrence wrote to a friend, and looking back over all I've written over the past few weeks it seems a quite intuitive choice.  "I've got on my conscience a novel I wrote, and which is much too shocking -- verbally -- for any publisher. Says shit! and fuck! in so many syllables. So if it's going to be published, I'll have to do it myself . . . But it's a good novel -- love, as usual -- and very nice, too, but says all the things it shouldn't say."  All while I was working, I couldn't read anything serious. From the ages of twenty through twenty nine, I was first a secretary/administrative assistant, and then I was a desktop publisher/graphic designer/art department/website person, whatever you want to call it. I basically went blind nine months a year typesetting seven point type on a screen eight hours a day. The other three months, I hired photographers and negotiated with printers.  By the time I got home at night, though, I was so beat I couldn't do anything.  All this by way of saying I couldn't even comprehend something as complex as Lawrence in those days. There was only so much brain to go around.  And after the baby was born, well, there wasn't any brain at all until like three months ago.  That's not exactly true; I had a small burst when P was about a year old: she liked to play with toys on a blanket and watch videos, and I could sit next to her and read.  After that, she got so mobile and sassy there was no more reading.  But anyway, after I found the quote,  Lady Chatterley  was still lying around and I kept moving it from place to place, but not putting it in a bookcase. And one night I opened it again and started reading that classic first line:   Ours is essentially a tragic age, so we refuse to take it tragically.   I kept reading. And I actually could concentrate on it, an extreme rarity. I know there is a sort of English majory competition, even within ourselves, that goes on, like, I've read that, I've read that, I've read that, pointing to all the classics on a shelf in a bookstore.  But to come back to something like this, when I'm in my thirties -- when the last time I looked at it I was nineteen -- is quite an amazing thing.  This is one of the most reviled and highly-censored books on the planet. And why? Because of the frankness of its sexuality, which, if you read it, is pretty average in its sensuality as erotica goes for this day and age. It's actually somewhat tame, considering. But remember Lawrence wrote it -- he basically died of TB, rewriting it three times, sitting with his dog under a tree, pausing to hemmorhage -- in 1930. A different time altogether.  All sort of myths and fables have arisen around it, and a lot of sensationalism, but in this case, I say, go back to the book.  Lawrence originally intended to entitle the book  Tenderness . It is a deeply tender novel, beautifully written, incredibly moving. For those of you who don't know the basic gist, it's the story of a baronet's wife, Constance Chatterley, who has an affair with the gamekeeper on her husband's estate. For her it is out of desperation and loneliness, because her husband sustained disabling injuries in World War I that withered his spirit along with his body.  For the gamekeeper, Oliver Mellors, loving this woman is a way to bring himself back to life after a terrible marriage and a long stint in the army in India. He is a commoner, and an affair with his social better is obviously taboo. He speaks in Derbyshire dialect throughout the entire thing, which can be a little hard to follow, but use your imagination.  The book has been deconstructed, reconstructed, and deconstructed again through every possible critical lens -- Freudian, feminist, and from a class perspective to name a few. But I find myself drawn back to the writing itself, needing absolutely no critical perspective to have this book hit me in the guts. My favorite scene, and in my opinion one of the best portrayals of human emotion and hopelessness in all of English literature is below. This is the first time that the two lovers are truly alone together.   "There!" he said, holding out his hand to her. She took the little drab thing between her hands, and there it stood, on its impossible little stalks of legs, its atom of balancing life trembling through almost weightless feet into Connie's hands. But it lifted its handsome, clean-shaped little head boldly, and looked sharply round, and gave a little "peep." "So adorable! So cheeky!" she said softly.    The keeper, squatting beside her, was also watching with an amused face the bold little bird in her hands. Suddenly he saw a tear fall on her wrist.   That single tear on Connie's wrist has always represented to me my own fragility, my own darkest struggles, my own flaws. My femininity. My  humanity.

Me: I said on the blog "all S's mistresses have digital displays."  S:  Mmmmmm  . .. .robotic fem-bot .. . .

      Going to Christian conference this week, for a day, and I couldn't feel less like being there, in part because of this blog.  My counselor says just sew a scarlet B (for blog) on this shirt and go. She's joking, of course, she says no one has to know.  Since I started this I have decided I am no longer a Christian writer. Well, I am still a Christian -- or else I wouldn't be sitting here at seven minutes after seven with a benadryl hangover, about to go lead a church service. Nothing about  that  has changed, or my heart.  What has changed is my voice. When you write for the Christian market, swear words are verboten, as are substitutes for swear words ("golly!"). If you can go to hell on cursing alone, then I'm sure St. Peter has his hand on the trap door release just for me. I love to curse. Love it. As a poet I understand the power of language and that language has  power.  I don't know about you, but I wouldn't want to live in a world where you couldn't let some nice Anglo-Saxon roll off your tongue when the opportunity presents itself.I could go up against a longeshoreman on an average day, and try as hard as I can to do it out of P's earshot. Still, I feel the residual guilt about it -- (my mother's voice, "that's not how a lady talks.") I give it up for Lent every shrove Tuesday and am repenting of my failing by the first Friday. I did what Homer Simpson did this year and put a quarter in a Lent offering folder everytime I cursed, and I filled it in a week.  Yet there is a me that can pull the pious thing off. I have a heart for the Lord (as long as he doesn't care about cursing and I don't think he does. If Jesus hit his thumb with a hammer, what would he do?) I am going to see what I can get out of it, but I am not necessarily going to find out how to get published.  You should know that I contemplated seminary this year. Seriously contemplated it -- started discernment. I believe that God puts you where you need to be.  I decided against it. I wanted to do it to deepen my prayer life, and my understanding, not plan covered dish suppers to support the roof fund. Also, once you graduate, it's kind of like the Army -- they put you where they need you, and that would mean the Rowhouse might be in question. S's career is extremely specialized. He can't just pick up and go.  How deep my love for Christ is, and how I have always felt his hand over my life! You should also know my conversion took place in a basement. My age: five. My converter: none other than ALa71. I've never looked back.  And so I claim to be a protestant, yet I wear a miraculous medal, which is a piece of catholic idolatry according to some. And I believe it works. I love religion, love icons, love the art, the church, the organ, the old hymns, the polyester robes, the bells, smells, liturgy, everything about it. I love trying to be the person God wants me to be, and I struggle mightily with it too.  I prayed for a long while -- my prayer life has turned somewhat unconventional too, sometimes it has words, sometimes it does not -- that I would find my voice in my writing, that I would move to the next thing, the right thing, in my work. I have gone down so many blind alleys.  Here I am writing in the blog and this is the closest thing to my actual voice that you and I will ever hear. And so when people say, "Are you working on your next book?" I say indeed I am. It's the blog. The blog is the book.  "for God's gifts and his call are irrevocable." -Romans 11:29

      God, I miss ALa71.  She'll be back from her vacation soon, but I must speak to her for at least an hour a day in order for my life to make any sense at all.  In the meantime, I'm stuck contemplating the week ahead of me without her sage advice and timely reassurances.  I am a complete introvert -- complete. I don't like parties, I don't like bars, I don't like meetings, I loathe committees of any sort. I don't like socializing of any kind, really. I love talking to people one on one, on the phone, over tea, by email -- and I'm capable of entertaining a group of people with my various agonizing anecdotes, but really I have to lie on my face for like a day afterward to reconnoiter. It just takes so much energy from me to have to be in a space where everyone is talking.  We did a Meyers Briggs at work -- one of those futile "staff-building" exercises that get you out of work for a couple hours. One aspect of my personality was E -- extrovert -- but only by a single point.  I hung a shingle at my old job by my cube, which read, "Complimentary Medical, Psychiatric and Veterinary Consultations 9:30-9:45 AM weekdays." Never mind that I was the art department (and I  was  the art department -- just me, under the supervision of an editor) . . . I had plenty of takers. I know quite a bit about the above areas of inquiry, and people entrusted me with their darkest secrets -- not to mention detailed descriptions of various skin eruptions -- and I held their confidences. I am the soul of discretion. I try to keep my ear to the ground and my mouth shut.  But this week . . .this week I'm flagging when I need to be unfurling. I have liturgy tomorrow, and I about feel like rising to the occasion. Monday I'm babysitting up the road of the devil. Tuesday, P has school. Wednesday . . . I can't remember. Maybe nothing. Thursday, school but I will be at the Christian conference all day -- I only got out of part of it. Friday, S is off.  My favorite thing about the stay at home life is the Open Week, with nothing on the calendar. I have one web job that's six hours a week, but the past two weeks I've done eleven each because we've had some big projects. The money is nice but it's tough to find the time. I do two websites as a volunteer, so my work checks never reflect my effort. I love volunteering . . . I just wonder sometimes, where does it all end?  There is no limit to the number of people that call me asking to do things. I'm a bit of a sucker, but I'm learning to say no.  I have to also do my church's newsletter this month. My pastor pulls you aside and uses a Vulcan mind-meld to convince you to do things. He's a master. I hope it goes smoothly, because I don't have time for it not to.  As for the blog and its hugeness? Well, I'll tell you something S said today at our lunch. He told my friend H it's hard to work down here at night because of the machine-gun staccato of my typing. I think I've gotten even faster than 65 WPM, if that's possible.  So this doesn't take as much time as you think. No, really!

      The last of three "second-class phones" (do you remember that commercial?) died last night -- batteries finally gave way. I'm in the Rowhouse all day most of the time, and while I do chores I jabber on the phone to all and sundry. Anyway, S went on and on about how much it would be a waste to replace the battery in the other phone, because we don't have a charger blah blah blah.  He went to Radio Shack and bought a new phone last night (after applying for and receiving their credit card). This phone is like a new car -- it has bells and whistles galore. S has been babying it all day, carrying it with him, clipping it to his pocket, putting it down gently in its cradle, practically crooning to the thing. Note: it only rang once, and it was a wrong number.  I asked him at one point if he were in love with the phone and he ignored me.  He just got up from his computer, which is across the room, and came and put it beside me, near its answering machine/intercom cradle. Gently. (He won't be here hopefully next week when I toss it down the steps ahead of the laundry basket.)  "What," I teased, "did you get tired of having it clipped to your pocket finally?"  "No," he said, with a laugh, "I wish it still was."

      We took the scenic route home, because 76 was jammed as it always is with its inexplicable stoppage of traffic. So we went along 23 -- S drives my car very close to the curbs, and with a certain amount of heart-stopping panache -- and I tried not to contemplate my imminent demise and instead feasted my eyes on all there was to see.  The Anonymous Rowhouse is so modest. And I mean modest. It's very small, our furnishings are all hand-me downs (except for the sofa and chair; with some of the money we made from selling the first anonymous rowhouse, I demanded in the eleventh year of my marriage a sofa that was not one of my stepmother's castoffs. And I got it. It's lovely. But it's under a slipcover now.)  The Rowhouse is located in a neighborhood of rowhouses among neighborhood after neighborhood of rowhouses. It's population-dense here. If the walls between the houses could magically dissolve, you could probably look from side to side and see people tweezing their nosehair, that's the degree of proximity we're talking about.  The drive along route 23 was the exact opposite -- big, wrought iron fences, walls that go for blocks and belong to a single property. (My mother used to say, "When people run out of things to do with their money, they build walls.") Up on big hills, on a road shaded with arching trees, humungous properties gleamed in the sun. I even looked down a tiny street once, a side road, that a single car could not comfortably fit through, and at the end saw an English garden and a cottage, as if I were in Staffordshire and not just outside Conshohocken.  Sometimes, there were tennis courts beyond the fences. Carriage houses with satellite dishes. Pools glistening and in the sun.  "Contemplating the wealth?" S asked.  "Yes. We'll never live here."  "Would you want to? I kind of like where we live. It's close to everything."  "I don't know  . . . I keep wondering, how do they get around on these precipitous roads in the snow? "  "I was thinking the exact same thing."  I told him what it was was not the tennis courts, or the twirly roads, or the satellite dishes, or cottages with curtains more expensive than all of my furniture combined. It was the money. It was the not having to worry.  I have worried about money my entire life and I am still worrying about it. There is never enough. I never go to bed at night thinking, "Everything is taken care of." Yet it appears, from looking at those winding drives and quiet glades, there may be people who can think that way.  "They can't, either," S says. "How do they afford all this? Everyone worries about it."  Do they?

      We are at a bar in Wigan called Henry Afrika's and we are the only ones from the thirty five Americans from our program who have shown up.  Later, when we tell people we spent homestay in Wigan, they laugh and say incredulously, "Wigan!" as if no one goes there. A backwater, hicksville, filled with people no one would want to meet.  "Where is everyone?" Jen says. She is a girl I met four days ago, my roommate from London orientation. I liked her instantly -- her deep laugh, the funny little glasses she wears when she reads, her big trenchcoat, her penchant for exclaiming extremely sacreligious things at moments of crisis.  "Oh, God . . . I think that's that guy, Jim .. . hey, Jim! Why is he ignoring us?"  "I don't think he knows it's us," I say.  "He knows, he knows . . . what an asshole! Where can we get something to drink in this place?"  The bar is five-deep. The deejay is a man dressed as a nun. I have never seen so many guys that look like they just left work in a bank. Why is everyone wearing a white shirt and a red tie?  We stand by the bar, and stand, and stand. When Jen sees a tiny opening she thrusts herself into it, orders, and we wait. A neon sign that reads "RICK'S CAFE AMERICAIN" throbs behind the bar.  The bartender asks her the order three times. They're not used to hearing American accents here.  "Didn't S say he was coming?" Jen says over her shoulder.  "He said. But I talked to him earlier and he told me his homestay father made elderberry wine for a hobby, so him and Leavitt are probably drunk off their asses playing air guitar in some gazebo . . . Jen, look out, that dude's about to spill some green shit on you!"  "Cheers!"A very lanky boy with a shock of blond hair -- mostly shaved blond hair, I correct myself -- carrying a drink a shade of green only seen in chemical refining plants approaches us.  He's not dressed like a bank boy -- this guy is dressed rough, and covered with those kinds of prison tattoos you see across people's fingers.  "Um . . .hello," Jen answers, and I smile sort of wanly. I would much rather associate with the bank boys tonight. Or with no boys at all.  Where the hell is S?I know why my father thought it was a grand idea to have S come along. S and I were kind of dating, kind of seeing other people for the past couple of years -- only neither of us really were seeing anyone except each other.  My father's last words to me when I left were, "Don't come home married." I know he didn't mean to S -- it is nearly a foregone conclusion that S and I will marry eventually, we've been dating for the better part of four years. He meant to one of those filthy foreigners. The American boyfriend was good protection.  And S already acts like a husband. At orientation, he beat on my room door, bellowing, "Where's the shampoo?"  People were like, "Did you guys meet  on the plane ?"  No. We didn't.  But back at Henry Afrika's, Green Drink is asking Jen to repeat herself.  "I said HELLO!" Jen bellows. She's from New York and not accustomed to suffering fools.  "Are you  American ?" and he says it the way English people say it, when you're not in London -- in a tone of wonderment, with their voices dipping down a little at the end.  As if that whole colonial nightmare they jettisoned for good in 1783 after the war got too long doesn't actually have normal people in it, but some strange species of . . ..I can't think clearly. I'm too busy worrying how we'll get away from the blond boy and his weird drink.  "What is that drink called?" Jen asks him.  "A monkey's armpit," he says, with a charming smile that shows a mouthful of English teeth.  "Lads! Lads! He calls around the border of the throbbing room, and several other guys who look like they cut the iron cuffs off their ankles from a prison detail gather around us like curious natives, regarding us with eyes that have too much beer behind them and bodies that are standing too close.  "These girls -- what did you say your names were?"  "Jen and Rose," Jen blurts. Oh God, now they know our names!  "Jen and Rose," the blond boy says proudly, "are from America."  "America?! Really? The land of the fucking Muppets," one of them says, "And Hawaii Five-Oh. I'm Darren, but my friends call me Brass."  He extends his hand for us to shake.  Holy blessed mother.  "And I'm Skinner," says the blond boy. What a charming name, I think. A boy you could bring home to mother and dad.  "I'm Mick," a tall, dark one says, and all those threads of chemistry you feel when you meet someone -- whether you like them coming toward you or not, and in this case, I don't -- determine for me in that instant that he thinks I'm a prospect.  But we're crammed in by the bar, and there's no escape.  "You said your name was . . . Ruth?" he says to me, his tone as intimate and low as it can get in a bar.  At least he's drinking beer, and not something which, if he spills it, will stain -- unlike the monkey's armpit, which Skinner never appears to drink from and which sloshes teeteringly around the top of the glass every moment.  "No, it's Rose," I correct him, "like the flower."  "Lovely," he says.  Skinner's voice snaps his head around, and I'm left standing next to Jen.  "Let's sit over here and chat a bit," Skinner says, and he directs us toward some little grotto part of the room. I bump Jen lightly with my elbow, and she looks back and sees my look of panic.  "Relax," she says with a smile.  I know I'm a babe in the woods, I'm only eighteen and certainly not legal nor nearly-legal at home. I mean, I go to dances and stuff on campus, but nothing like this.  Nothing like stuck in a bar that's like a roadhouse, with a bunch of people I wouldn't give the time of day to at home, in the middle of an English night, pitch black with no streetlights, that my homestay mother -- we're staying with families for five days before we reach our university -- drove and drove around curves and deep hedgerows to find.  My father would say at this moment that I am not being street-smart, and that he's disappointed, because he taught me better. All kinds of bells and whistles are going off, and as is typical of my teetotaling self -- this half will be my only drink of the night -- I'm letting consequence cloud an otherwise good time.  "I just wish they weren't so . . .rough," I say in Jen's ear. Her hair tickles my nose and I smell her perfume over all the smoke. "They're like bovver boys -- yobs, whatever you call them. Those guys that trample people at soccer stadiums."  She waves her hand. "Oh, it'll be for a couple of minutes -- everyone else is bound to get here soon. It's not like anyone else is talking to us . . ."  "Dude, they look like prison escapees," I say urgently. "And they're drunk as shit."  We're almost at the banquettes where they've invited us to sit.  Jen laughs. "I know, isn't it hilarious? 'Hey mom, hey dad! This is my new boyfriend, Skinner. He just got out of state pen.'"  "We're never getting home tonight," I say.  "Would you stop! I just have to call Malcolm from the phone box outside. It's what he said to do."  I do try to relax. I might as well. There's no way to excuse ourselves -- the bar isn't that big, Malcolm isn't even expecting our call until eleven, and Jim, our only hope from the group, is surrounded by English girls laughing uproariously around him.  I end up seated next to Mick, of course. He's tall and thin, with a little mustache, blue eyes, a nice smile. They're all nineteen. They're construction workers. They speak in a broad accent that is nearly impossible to understand.  Despite their initial -- felonious -- appearance, they appear more polite and reasonable than I first thought. I do start to relax and enjoy myself, and think, maybe I was just being stupid, Jen knows her shit, she clubs in New York, for Christ's sake. I think I'm just being a ball of anxiety, as usual.  Relax, Rose. You're in a new country -- here to have these precise kinds of experience -- relax.  They want us to dance with them -- so we do. That's an amazing thing, really, and a lot of fun. "Come on Eileen" by Dexy's Midnight Runner's comes on and at one point we're doing the can-can in this huge long line of construction workers and bank boys and blond girls.  After the song, we go back, but I see Jen is pinned beneath Skinner, doing almost a limbo pole move, and he's trying to kiss her.  My thought at that moment, "I can't believe she's kissing him!"  When she disentangled herself and got back to the banquette, she told me she wasn't kissing him -- she was just trying to get away.  Time goes by. They ask us questions about home. Skinner never does drink the monkey's armpit. And then it's last call. And then time to go.  Out of the crowd, Mick gloms onto us, and the line for the phone box is thirty deep. Skinner and Darren (my friends call me Brass) disappear.  We determine that we can't wait, so we'll figure out how to walk it."I know the way," Mick says, when Jen tells him where we're staying. And he is a perfect gentleman walking us home, albeit a drunk one who pauses at one point to piss on a wall.  That is, until Jen leaves -- her house is before mine, and I don't even remember where mine is. I only got here just yesterday.  "Now, are you sure you know how to get her home, Mick?" Jen says to him.  "Yeah, yeah, I know!" he says. "Good night, Jen."  My antennae go up again and swirl around a minute too late, but Jen is gone up the road, and it is so dark. I rationalize my ass off to keep from dying on the spot. There are high stars, and they don't care what happens down here. The moon looks like it has a face that's scowling.  I start to say something to him, something conversational and light, because he was really just talking to Jen before.  "Do you ever think that --"  "You daft, daft wench," Mick interrupts.  "What?" I walk a little faster, and wish I knew where I was going. He's a step behind, but he catches up, and he's angry all of a sudden.  "Well, what the fuck do you think you're playing at, walking around with a bloke you hardly know in the middle of the night? I could rape you or anything. No one would know."  Now at this point in writing it seems conjectural, what he was saying. But it wasn't. I was there. There was something bad in the air all around. He wasn't being friendly.  "What?" Oh, God, I walk a little faster. He must be messing around. If I act all scared, will that make him madder? How can I get him to get me where I need to go without pissing him off and without getting myself in a bad situation . . .. maybe it's just him being drunk . . . think, Rose, think.  You've been in worse situations before. That time in the subway -- where can I go -- a yard, up a tree? Say this is my house here, I'm going in the backdoor? But she told him the address! And how would I get home?  Why do the fucking street signs have to be on rocks at the corners. Aren't you supposed to make friends with potential attackers, so they see you more compassionately? Oh, Jesus, Jesus. Get me out of this.  The more minutes I can get to go by, the further along we'll be, the better off I'll be. Keep walking. Deflect him. Don't talk too much. He knows where he's going.  "Fucking Americans, you think," he says gravely, slurring the words out -- his accent is thick, he's hard to understand. Some dogs bark, and drown out his words, but I'm trying to get anything I can from him to figure out where I'm going, and keep a safe distance between us, "you think you can come the fuck over here and just be here, don't you? -- Well, we don't want you here! And then you think oh it's just little fucking north of England and I can walk home with any bloke and allsorts, and he won't touch me -- is that it?"  He grabs my wrist.  "You can't touch me," I say, shaking his hand off. His grip is strong, and it's not easy. "That's not a good idea."  "The hell you say," he says.  Christ, I wish I knew where I was! I don't have my bearings -- that's the problem, you can't be street smart when you don't know the streets. It's so goddamned dark!  "Look, you told my friend you'd get me home, so do it. I know your name. I know what you do. My father, the cop, would be pleased to get the next plane --"  "Ah, there's a bit of Philadelphia fire there, isn't there! American girls. Always got your tongues wagging, don't you? Well, no one would rape you in England -- this isn't America, you know. That's the sort of thing a bloke would do there, isn't it? Not here. I was just having a laugh, wasn't I?"  "Let's . . .just keep going."  He laughs crazily. "Are you frightened?"  "No."  "It would be a daft thing if you were. I'm not going to hurt you."  He goes on some more, but I think it's just that he's drunk, and after a while I realize that he probably won't do all the colorful things he's saying he wants to do --- things that he might not even be able to do, so drunk he is.  I don't really doubt my ability to get away from him -- but then where would I go! I am horrible with direction and finding my way. I once took a cab in London a block because I couldn't find my hotel.  My heart's pounding and my conscience is kicking my ass -- I knew this was a bad situation from the minute it commenced, so my street smarts are still there, they're just screwed up and around -- I have to listen to them, new country or not. New friend or not.  Why didn't I stay with Jen? What would have been the difference? I trusted him, I'm so stupid. I'm such an idiot. He's right. What am I doing walking home with him in the middle of the night? I have a lot to learn about England. I have a lot to learn about life.  Amazingly, he makes good on his word to Jen and does get me home.  I recognize the little house, the garden, and I have my key out of my pocket before we even stop, and get it into the door.  He turns me around -- he's amazingly strong for someone who is so lean. Good gracious.  "Well, thanks for walking me home," I say, as nicely as I can so I don't piss him off again, inching my foot back, trying to get between the sash and the storm door.  "Don't I get a kiss!" he says. "For walking you all that way! I got you home, didn't I? And why don't you invite me in for a brew!"  "This isn't my house, and the people who I'm staying with are asleep," I say reasonably. "I can't invite you in. I'm sorry."  "Oh, come on," he chides. "I'm sure they won't mind it one way or t'other."  "I think they might," I say, "Good night."  I give him a peck on the cheek.  "Is that all I get!"  "That is all you get," I tell him. "Good night, Mick."  "Would you like to come to the swimming baths tomorrow?"  "No, no, I don't think so. Good night."  I get in the house, leaving him there, and stand with my back against the door, on the other side. My heart frogging away in my chest. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing.

      We are going to visit an old, dear college friend of mine today, and that is a lovely, lovely thing.  We lost touch, of course, that way old college friends often do. But we found it again, the way old college friends often do. Being around her is like coming home to a time in my life that I loved. So much has changed. And nothing has.  Both of us have endured a great deal in the years since college. And yet we can get back to a place where that matters, and where it doesn't.  Our friendship is remarkable for three things. We both studied in England at the same time -- though not in the same place. She was in London, I was in Lancaster, in the north, near the Lake District.  We also both got engaged in the same week.  The third thing really is remarkable. We were together on the landing of the castle -- our school had a real castle -- when the First Gulf War was declared on television. Just the two of us. I can't remember what we were working on -- essays, I think.  I think back to that moment, how afraid we were. And I bring myself up to this moment, how afraid we sometimes still are. The government says don't be afraid, be ready. But how can you not be . . . especially after you have children, when so much more is at stake?  A lot changed that night, with the first President Bush on the television, his voice rising in the great wide hall from the security guard's desk, reaching us on the crushed velvet couch up on the landing, and we just looked at each other. This was a war, and it was a war at a time when the people we loved were old enough to fight it. It wasn't just some stories that someone else told, of a long-ago war.  A lot changed then and is still changing.  "If there must be trouble, let it be in my day, that my child may have peace."  -- Thomas Paine

      I am absolutely positively staying away from this tonight if it kills me.  I nearly passed out from low blood sugar after we walked home from the supermarket. P walked all sorts of silly trippy ways the whole way home (she's going through some developmental leap/experimentation thing again with her speech and motor, usually when she has done this before in a few weeks she's more skilled than before), S was nowhere to be found as he was at Radio Shack fighting over cordless phone warranties, I was carrying 3 massively heavy bags, I ate like crap all day, I've been sleeping like shit, and I have to really watch myself now. I can't let myself get that hungry on the medication I'm on or I'm in big trouble.  I'm turning off the computer now. Any second.  A pleasant Friday evening to you all.

      I approached my laconic brother, who was installing a new aerial on his Pathfinder. ("Car wash," he explained.)  He took one look at P's shirt (blue, with red trim, oldschool writing with a picture of an atom, "SCIENCE ROCKS") and said, "Did S grow out of that four days ago and give it to her? Or does he still wear it to bed?"  That's the kind of brother I have. And the kind of S.  Anyway, it was fun. Sitting with my niece who is fourteen and lovely, but can't be bothered with anything her mother says. And my nephew who is twelve, and my sister in law Sandy who is P's favorite person. (Their other son was running back and forth helping his dad with the SUV).  We watched  Fantasia  and made fun of the centaurs' choice of mates and the filthy cloud Zeus slept on. During the dinosaur segment, I gave a mini-lecture on Stravinsky's  Rite of Spring  and the first performance -- I think it was in Paris, with Nijinsky dancing the role -- and how it ushered in modernism, a movement which was eventually defined as a response to the period surrounding World War I and the attendant insanity of that conflict, the likes of which the world had never before seen. Picasso cubism Siegfried Sassoon Mrs Dalloway blah. I'm sure they were all rolling their eyes as surreptitiously as they could. I don't know why I bother wasting brain or my breath on this stuff anymore. Still, they feigned interest.  We repaired to the kitchen and ate cookies I never eat here because they have peanut traces. P was safely in the living room instructing M through the front window on how to best wash the Pathfinder.  Sandy showed me a container of Flintstones calcium supplement and complained bitterly that Pebbles' outfit did not match the overall layout of the packaging. Pebbles was wearing an orange shirt and green shorts. I said it was designed to pop and annoy and make you buy it and that clearly it had worked on her. Sandy noted her annoyance about Bam Bam's lime green war club, and I admitted I had never seen wood of that hue.  I helped Shane with his book report on  Treasure Island . I never read it but explained thematic underpinnings of books. It's never just about a boy on a trip. It's about what happens  inside  the boy. That sort of thing.  I felt kind of melancholy. If S and I dropped dead, P would go to live with M and Sandy. She was lying there identically to my niece, on her stomach with her face resting on her hands, and she looked so good with siblings. I've always felt this way. I have no inclination to give her a brother or a sister from our loins -- we only ever wanted one child. But I couldn't help wondering if she were missing something, my own horrific sibling experience notwithstanding. Who will she go and visit when she grows up and is bored on Friday afternoons?

      Inspired by EXFBonnie's post yesterday I went and purchased again the Beach Boys CD that P so loves and that we lost.  After all my carping and griping this morning, I feel transformed.  Brian Wilson's voice on "Don't Worry Baby" can fix anything in this world.

      Fairycat is playing with the cap from a razor, because I spent $4 on new toys for her at PetSmart yesterday.  P is upstairs eating the following breakfast (her request): cake, potato chips, crackers, soy milk, soy yogurt. This is because S isn't home. I give her whatever she wants to eat when he isn't here.  Shhhh!   She is watching the Berenstein Bears and drumming her feet on the kitchen bench.  I am so goddamned tired. I stretched out on the couch in the sun after my post this morning, because she wasn't up yet, but within moments she was. This is how it always goes: as soon as I rest my weary brow, an alarm goes off in her head.  We are going to my brother's this afternoon, because it's a beautiful day and there's nothing else to do. P loves it there. When I asked her whom her favorite person was this morning, longing for a "well, of course, it's you, Mommy," instead she said, "Aunt Sandy."  I finished my heinous amount of web work this week and am feeling pretty good about it.  S took off yesterday. The day concluded amiably, but it was a bad day.  What is it with men? How come everything gets done invisibly when they're not around, and that's fine with them. But let them be in the same space -- well, then, that's not the right way to hang those khakis on a hanger.  Give them to me. The seam goes this way.   (Rose leaves room, muttering and flipping two birds behind his back)  Ah. Love. Exciting and new. Come aboard. We're expecting you!

      Forty  thousand  words.  That's how much I've written on this thing since July 17.  Okay, two of my books were 45,000 each, and it took me six months. My 100,000-word book took me about nine.  So there was research for those. That was part of it . . . but still. My shoulders are sore.  I am so glad to have this, by the way. In part the reason I've written so much is because many of these stories have been inside me like jumping beans for years, just waiting to get out, but with no context to bring them forth.  So, for this morning, to give my brain a break, I made a "short list" of my favorite poems.  I love more poems than this, of course. Will think of them as time goes on. I may even post some, if I can get over the copyright infringement thing in my mind. Is the internet copyrighted? I can't remember. Part of one of my jobs was writing to many publishing houses getting permission to use lines of poetry in publications, and it took forever.  Many of the poems I know from memory. When I chalk with P out front I write these lines in color and P draws flowers around them.  My favorite poet? Pablo Neruda. His Twenty Love Poems and a Song of Despair is one of the finest works of poetry ever written. The WS Merwin translation is sublime.  Second favorite: Wilfred Owen. His Collected Poems were written in the World War I trenches, and he was killed shortly before the armistice in November 1918.  Great poetry is missing from our lives. They said it better!  1."Here I Love You," Pablo Neruda 2. "The Visitor," Carolyn Forche 3. "i thank you god for most this amazing," e.e. cummings 4. "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock," T.S. Eliot 5. "Bavarian Gentians," DH Lawrence 6. "Sailing to Byzantium," WB Yeats 7. "The Clod and the Pebble," William Blake 7. "After Great Pain, A Formal Feeling Comes," Emily Dickinson 9."Futility," Wilfred Owen 10. "A Red, Red Rose," Robert Burns 11. "The Break," Anne Sexton 12. "She Walks in Beauty," Lord Byron 13. "A Nocturnall Upon St. Lucies Day," John Donne 14. "Ariel," Sylvia Plath 15. "When I Have Fears That I May Cease To Be," John Keats 16. "The Windhover," Gerard Manley Hopkins 17. "Fern Hill," Dylan Thomas 18. "So Much Depends," William Carlos Williams 19. "Verde Que Te Quiero Verde," (Green How Much I Want You Green), Federico Garcia Lorca 20. "This Be the Verse," Philip Larkin

      S occasionally takes it upon himself to do some massive reorganization, which is fine with me because I'm a secret slob. Tonight, it's the CD collection. At one point he says to me, as if trying to gauge my reaction as carefully as possible, " Do you intend to buy any more ABBA CD's . . .  ?"  He said the query was for alphabetization purposes, but do I need to worry that he'll somehow desecrate the Dancing Queen?  I need to do an entire post on ABBA. Just not tonight.

      Really, if you were to go back to the very beginning of it all, you would have to start with Dick and Jane.  I wore Maidink's hand-me-downs, because she's three years older than me. And once, the bag of hand-me-downs contained a book.  I memorized this book, because that's the kind of person I am. And I went off to kindergarten and painted some things, and played with some puppets, and so on, the way that you did in kindergarten back then.  Now, you're expected to know Swahili AND middle German when you go -- in addition to differential equations and how to play well with others-- but back then, as many of you remember, it was a means by which your mother fobbed you off for a few hours so she could go get her hair done.  Then I got to first grade. It was just across the hall in my little school.  How surprised and delighted I was to find the same book that had been in the bag of Maidink's rejects! So surprised, in fact, that I read it to the entire class on the first day.  The teacher's eyebrows must have raised a fraction, but I didn't notice.  The next thing I knew, I was shipped off to another class where a really mean old-school teacher ("but you'll remember my name!" she assured me, and I do) handed me a book with lots more words than the first one in it, and I read that one, too.  I read and read and read and read and read and read and read. I read so much my brain hurt. I read with the book almost against my face -- I don't do that anymore. I never had to mouth the words.  I read so much that I rushed through my math and science tests and the teacher kept tapping her pencil on my paper and saying, "I can't believe you got this wrong; you're lazy. Four quarts equal a gallon. Go write it on this index card as many times as it can fit. You'll never forget it, then."  I did. And I didn't forget.  Then that year ended and I was in still another class with even older kids. Then they made me go take a special test in the counselor's room, then another one at a building covered with ivy where a man asked me my birthday and told me instantaneously exactly how old I was in years, months and days. He gave me a lot of pictures of stories that I had to put into sequential order. That wasn't a big deal.  Next thing I knew, once a week I was in a class with a computer -- there was a big phone you put in a big cradle and you made stuff on it like banners of your name using commands like "10 Print."  We also learned French and visited museums.  By this time I was in fourth grade, having done first and second in one year, then third. One day, in the car, scarfing down Roy Rogers' roast beef sandwiches, my mother said to me, "Would you like to go to a school downtown?"  And so began my association with Doogie Howser High.  I'll never forget my first day: I'll be surrounded by people like me! It was partially true. It was way more stratified than Little Neighborhood School, and several girls in my class made it no secret that they would prefer my demise above all things.  That resulted in a meeting with the assistant assistant principal, who habitually used the phrase, "Do you follow me?" and pushed his glasses up his nose, with a tic, every five seconds.  The girls were told to leave me alone, which is why they tripped me and pushed me every chance they got. They also made whispers sometimes about another girl in the class, who is still my friend to this day.  Instead of trips and all kinds of VIP treatment like I got at my first school, this school took more of a gradgrindian approach to learning. My teacher was ancient and wet her lips every two seconds. In fact, every faculty member seemed to be afflicted with something -- bad hair, a morose fashion sense, a penchant for mocking latecomers.  Yet I endured. I had no choice. My mother wanted me there. And, after all, it was supposed to be good.  Sixth grade passed in a blur. As happens in the lives of many sixth graders, my parents' marriage began its protracted unravelling process which was not without its attendant nightmares. That year, we were in a car pool, where I met my dear friend Kell, who posts on this blog.  We shared a bucket seat in the front all the way down the Surekill Distressway -- no seatbelt, of course. On rainy days, if her dad was driving, we took the scenic route -- Broad Street -- and delighted in splashing commuters waiting for buses at every corner.  Later, we would take SEPTA every day -- the el, the bus, the train, whatever came first, with mile walks to here and there between construction sites in town -- little kids among the adult commuters, dodging and dashing between suits and briefcases, eating pretzels and onion rings at eight o'clock in the morning just because we could.  At the end of sixth grade my parents organized themselves enough to make a decision together. I was, of course, recommended for the now-defunct "2 in 1" program that they used to call seven-two. I would enter seventh grade at age 11, and go onto high school after that.  My mother pulled me aside.  "I will allow you to skip one more grade," she told me, "but you must promise me that you will remain at Doogie Howser through high school."  It seemed like a fair enough bargain.  Doogie Howser in those days only had room for 30 students to "stay" for tenth grade. The rest fed out to other schools in the city. Most people who cared about a. a social life b. sports c. getting out of as much work as they could d. being somewhere where you weren't locked in all day and didn't get out until 3 PM went elsewhere.  Ninth grade came and may I say it was a challenge, but it's for another post. One, my parents' marriage imploded, and I mean  imploded  -- but that is a Proustian epic in itself. Two, I was woefully unprepared socially and possibly academically, and I had already started flunking higher maths with abandon in seventh grade. But I bore up adequately and still managed to get through, and I was accepted into Doogie Howser High.  Another funny thing happened in ninth grade. We had the best teacher for world history -- he and his wife were one of a handful of really wonderful teachers of whom that roach-motel of a school was undeserving. And he assigned a project where you had to make something, like a sculpture, or a craft, something 3-D and representative from the ancient world.  He always had someone come in from the year before to show off their brilliant project. The coerced volunteer stood by the teacher's side, looking uncomfortable. This particular year the teacher said, "This young man's last name looks like  Unpronounceable , but it is pronounced  Average Household Word ."  I slouched in my seat with a smirk as a painfully-skinny, heavy-metal-t-shirt wearing goober with a thatch of black hair that he kept tossing off his brow (because it was so overgrown) talked reluctantly about the finer points of a balsa wood trireme ship that he had lovingly carved over something like a million hours. His hair, I noticed, concluded somewhere down his back in a wickedly long mullet. I kept waiting for him to make secret devil sign with his fingers.   Who the hell does this geek think he is , I remember thinking.  How was I to know, at twelve years old, that here was the first time I would lay eyes upon my future husband and his Greco-Roman triple-oared creation?  He never lived that boat down, by the way. For that and other reasons, my brothers called him, and still often call him, "Boat."  Anyway, even though it was a small school I was not to even see the thatch-haired geek for several more years in any sort of official capacity. I forgot all about him and his boat, but I never forgot his weird last name and its quotidian pronunciation.  Against every possible forethought and instinct, I sincerely loved Doogie Howser High. My first day of tenth grade, I was so anxious to get there I dragged myself in with a 104.5 fever, had to be picked up by my shoulder-holster-wearing dad (he was a plainclothes police officer in those days) and made him stop the car on a highway so I could open the door and vomit on the shoulder.  There were 30 people in my class at first. Two left, one moved, and one came back in eleventh grade who had left after ninth.  Our class was remarkable for its lack of caring.  Oh, sure, there were the overachievers -- all schools have them, and Doogie Howser moreso than others. But mostly we were slackers even before slacking was called slacking. We hid in closets. We read comic book versions of classics. Our health class project on infant care (the carrying the egg back and forth thing) was riddled with kidnappings and ransom notes. We spent one whole study period when we were supposed to be talking about career planning writing a list of low status jobs one could possibly obtain, if they tried hard enough. I can still picture one guy -- now a respected PhD who owns a production company -- chalking the words "MORGUE ATTENDANT" at the bottom of the board.  Socially, I have to admit it was a little incestuous. I mean, there were only so many guys to choose from. So while I dated F, so did K, and so did E, and so did . . . God, who else did? Somebody, I'm sure, if I thought about it long enough. But it was all in a spirit of camaraderie.  I have to say that the day I graduated from there was one of the saddest in my life. We went all around in a circle and squeezed each other's hands. Corny, maybe, but we had a 10-year reunion (the reunion committee consists of me and Kell and her husband C -- from our class, too -- and sometimes A sitting around in Kell's living room going, "Should we do something, or what?" on a random afternoon) and 25 people of 28 showed up. Of the 3 that didn't something significant prevented them from doing so.  As you know, I graduated dead last with an 89 average, but everyone knew I wasn't book smart, because all I did was write stupid stories that made fun of everybody and poems that everyone pretended to understand.  And the geek with the floppy hair? Well, I didn't see him again until one time when I was alone on the El platform -- all my real friends having ditched me for this or that extracurricular activity that would get them into an Ivy League school. I deluded myself with no such aspirations, so I was there, and so was he.  And when he turned around and looked at me, I saw something amazing.  He had cut his hair, and his eyes were dark brown.

      My name is Rose and my hair needs product.  Okay, I do have long, naturally curly hair and always have had it -- except for three brief forays into rebellion. Its current length is (stretches longest curl) at my waistline. (ALa71: "You're the only person I know that still wears their hair the same way they did when they were five.") I know it's not so cool for a 33-year-old woman to be walking around with her 4-year-old with their hair done identically, but allow me to explain.  My daugher has absolutely glorious hair. She only had bangs cut twice (my sister in law the hairdresser wanted to kill me, because she said it would grow back "too thick," but she doesn't have bangs now and it's fine) and the back of her hair has never been cut. It goes down to the hem of her shorts, and the curls are glossy and honey-highlighted.  In fact, everywhere we go, people rave about her hair and P usually says something like, "Yes, I know it's beautiful!"  "Where did you get that wonderful hair?" people ask her, and then they vaguely glance at me and whatever random ponytail and pile of hopeless midday frizz I have going on,  despite my best efforts ,  thank you very much , and sort of half-heartedly smile and say, "Well, I guess you sort of have curly hair too."   Yes . I sort of have curly hair too and the haircare industry's scions sort of have eight yachts each just because of li'l ol' me.  I have a texture problem and I'm trying to fill the void with various frizz serums. Okay?  Okay?  You don't have to get mean about it.  Those kinds of "yesterday's breakfast" interchanges remind me, by the way, of one of my Disney stepmother's "compliments" during my pregnancy.  DISNEY: I can tell, you're carrying a girl. ME: Is that so? DISNEY: Yep, it is. ME: Okay, why? DISNEY: Because they steal all your beauty away from you.  Thanks, Mommie Dearest.  Clearly S's genes had something to do with P's gloriousness. S's hair is as straight as a poker and fine, and I thought, good God -- if P gets straight hair I'll be SOL, because you don't really learn to "do" curly hair. It does you.  So you have no styling skills whatsoever. Or at least I don't. Most curlyheads I know who do, have them because they were trying to defy their curls all these years. In my daughter's case, I pictured a poor straight-haired child with a perpetual Dorothy Hamill bowl cut because her hapless mother was unable to use a blow dryer.  But the thing about curly hair that people may not know is that it is actually a big barometer right on your head. The hotter and more sticky it gets, the more hair you have. That's why I always do P's and my hair the same. If it's dry and cool, it looks really quite good -- except in the winter, when it's so dry that you have to put about two gallons of conditioner on it every shower to keep it looking reasonable.  Let's explore some notions about curly hair and hair in general.  1. People pay to get those kinds of curls.  That may be so, but the kind of curls they get are much nicer than the ones I have. Straight hair has an innate silkiness to it that holds the curl better than actual curly hair, from what I've observed.  2. Curly hair is wash-and-go.  It's true that you can wash it and let it air dry without applying a mass of heat appliances to it. In fact, I tried to do that last winter to look more polished (Internal critic: "it's not seemly to be walking around in a ponytail, would you do your hair, for God's sake") -- and it actually fried my hair and made it look worse.  As an alternative, I often walk around with a soaking-wet head in all seasons and it dries into curls. However, the amount of goo required to actually produce curls rather than something looking like a woodland creature that stumbled into a transformer is truly astounding.  3. Just do 101 beauty strokes with a brush every night.  You can't actually BRUSH curly hair if it's dry unless you want it to look like a brillo pad after a rigorous use. You brush it IN the shower, WITH conditioner in it. Gently.  4. Doesn't the gel bottle say a dime-size portion?  Yeah, if you have a buzz cut. I fill both my palms with gel and then smooth it through. And sometimes it's too humid for even that.  5. Why did you cut your hair short?  The first time, I was 13. It was the 80's. "Tails" were in. I left one long tail and hacked the rest. I looked rather like a q-tip, but it went well with parachute pants and those assymetrical chintz shirts with the big collars and the snaps. I grew it out after six months -- I missed putting it into ponytails.  The second time I was 19. I had just gotten back from a year abroad, and I had to make a distinction between my former and current self. S and I were dating, and he hated it. That time, it was a little short bob -- I loved it. I got married the next summer, and I wanted an updo so I grew it out.  The third time I was 28. I was going through fertility treatment and basically hating the world, which included my own hair. I did a wedge -- shaved the back up really high on the ears. I loved that haircut, actually. S moaned on about missing my long hair, so I grew it out.  6. Why am I posting on this?  For two reasons. One, it got so humid during the night here (S always turns the airconditioner down, which I loathe, because I like it freezing cold like the dead of winter, with a big comforter on) and I could actually feel my hair frizzing out during the night. When I woke up, I looked in the mirror and laughed aloud at Rosanne Rosannadanna staring back at me.  So I had to go replace the tweezers that got inadvertently flushed down the toilet a couple of weeks ago -- I tried to buy an inferior pair to save money, but they didn't cut it -- and I went to the beauty supply that sells the awesome tweezers.  While there, as is my wont, I got all wrapped up in the amount of frizz-augmentation products like I always do. I remembered last week that S actually had to phone me while I was roaming around the drugstore, mesmerized by the array of haircare options. From his cell phone to mine, from the car. It takes me twenty minutes in the shampoo aisle, because I desperately want to believe the promises.  So okay, I do like my hair. It's like a pet you didn't really want but keep around for the hell of it. I wish it weren't so fluffy and problematic. But at my core, I am not a long hair person -- I wear it up so much one of my bosses actually called me "Bunhead," because I sat in front of her so she had to stare at my bobby-pinned cranium all day.  As in, "Bunhead, do you have those proofs finished?"  I actually answered to it after a while.

      I have answered a general email account for over a year for one of my jobs and I rarely get the same question twice. I am amazed at the things people ask, and I am amazed that I hardly ever know the answer. Is there nothing that won't occur to people to wonder? See, I just asked a question too.

       You Know You're From or In Pennsylvania If:                    You've never referred to Philadelphia as anything but "Philly."  And New Jersey has always been "Jersey."    You refer to Pennsylvania as "PA" (pronounced Peeay).How many other states do that?     You can use the phrase "fire hall wedding reception" and not even bat an eye.     At least 5 people on your block have electric "candles" in all or most of their windows all year long.       . . .  God, are they watching me?

      I was born worried.  No, really -- look at pictures of other little kids, their semi-daft expressions, their airy purposefulness, as if they have a sandcastle to build someplace and can barely stand still for the flashbulb.  I was the fourth kid, so there's only like five pictures of me from my entire childhood. (I would like to record here for my patriotic friends  -- Lefty, ALa71, This We'll Defend, Jen, JFM, 91Ghost and others -- who read this blog as a respite from the political wrangling -- that in one of the few pictures I have of myself as a kid, I'm saluting a flag. In a sailor suit. With a beatific look on my face. This image hung in a flag store in California for years. How's that for love of God and country! Whoops, I know, separation of church and state, see what happens when I say anything political . .. .)  On the other hand, my brother  M, as the beloved first, is in possession of so many images of himself that the remaining three of us would sift through the tapestry-lid box my mother had of them, going, "Is this one of me? No, that's M again. Damn." (Note to parents of multiple offspring: Please take pictures of  all  your children.)  But anyway, in my five or so childhood pictures, there I am with the little furrow between my brows. Looking worried. Now don't go start thinking I was a depressed child -- surely the little bit you've read of my adventures with ALa71 tells you otherwise -- but I was  concerned . Always.  One vignette from childhood says it all. Tudor Street was a straight blind hill that deadended into our childhood street, only a block long. ALa71 would feel like rollerskating -- she always felt like rollerskating, much to my chagrin -- and these were the days before helmets and pads and even rubber wheels.  These skates had metal wheels that snagged on every pebble you rolled over. ALa71 would go to the top of Tudor, put her hands on her knees, and speed down the entire block-long hill at mach 2, into whatever traffic might be coming, laughing her brains out -- both from the exhilaration of the experience and from watching my pained expression.  There I would be, creeping along the grass verge at the side of the road on the toes of my skates, screaming, "Be careful! Oh,  please  be careful! Do you have to skate down the  whole thing ? What if a car comes? Oh, God, what will I tell your mom if you get run over? Can we just go home and write stories in the yard? Oh, God, I hate rollerskating! Oh . . ."   Whoosh . Down she goes. "Hahahahaha Rose! Try it, you party pooper! Get out here now! It's so much fun!" (little post-hill twirl on the skates)  Apart from the fact that ALa71 deserves a medal for hanging around with such a wet blanket (there were very few children in the neighborhood, she really had no choice) incapable of childhood heedlessness, this one-of-a-thousand-possible-others example shows a mind clearly capable of thinking through all the daunting possibilities at once.  Well, parts of my childhood were downright tragic, but basically I came this way, fully-formed as it were. Even before I had anything to worry about, I worried.  Nevertheless I'm glad everything went down exactly as it did -- it makes for good stories here and at parties. It's the life I was given, and so when people say, "What if this were different?" I answer, "It's like asking, what is it like being a twin?" How would I know any different? It's what I am, it's what I was. And besides, it makes things interesting and I would probably not have a sense of humor if it weren't borne out of such ridiculousness on the part of my cosmic lot.  But I'm not going to lie. I'm always been worried as shit over all of it. If there were a Tour de France of worrying, I'd be Lance Armstrong.  And I have had depression. I fight against the possibility of that every single day. Most of the time, I acquit myself rather admirably on that front, with my underlying psyche feeling hopeful and reasonably contented, though it takes work and lots of changes in my thinking.  My base thinking would always worry, though. That's my first instinct. My thinking acquired from my "years in the chair" would say, wait a minute, isn't there a better way to think of this? Sometimes there is. Sometimes there isn't.  But some days I wake up and there's a little shard -- I can turn it over and over. It's like a piece of a mosaic that comes unglued and rests before my feet on the ground. It might shimmer or not, or be painted or not. It might  have something written on it, or not.  And sometimes I regard it and step over it and go on my way. And sometimes I pick up that shard and hold it for the rest of the day and wish I could find a place to put it down.

      P tumbled down 3 of the basement steps today, literally ass over teakettle. I was sitting right here working on the dreaded web calendars that have been plaguing my existence for days. I can literally touch the railing from where I sit -- the computer is right next to the steps -- so I jumped up and caught her before she rolled down them all.  Then I did what all the parenting books say not to do. I burst into tears.  She ended up consoling me. I think she was just surprised. I'm clutching her and bawling, asking, "Are you okay? Are you okay?" and she's like, "Mommy, I'm fine, but you need to take a break now."  I know you're not supposed to make it worse, but I can't always be the pillar of cool collectedness the child-rearing establishment expects. It terrified the bejesus out of me. I died about 4,000 deaths simultaneously. Not to mention have enough adrenaline still cycling through my veins to get through two Ironman competitions.  She's no worse for the wear -- S just came home and did some quick nerve function reflexes on her, the easy ones like squeeze my finger. He knows all about that stuff, it's what he does. I'm still a wreck. I noticed a new gray hair in the mirror as I was brushing her teeth.  Each one can be traced to a separate incident. I'm sure of it.

      They froze my back while I gave birth. It was then I thought  my simple heart would find its rest.  It was like waking up in the two parts air and one part silk breast of a dragonfly  after ten months of elephantine consequence. I thought:  what bliss.   These are the tricks your clever spirit plays before the bleakest brinks.  The out-of-body experience was next.  I actually wrote the above, which was actually published a month ago. The title, Calloo Callay, refers to the poem Jabberwocky -- I wrote it for an issue of a magazine on happiness -- and the lines by Lewis Carroll go, "O frabjous day! Calloo! Callay!" he chortled in his joy."  After all that fiddling around making her happen, she came out the usual way.  At the end of my pregnancy, both Dr. V -- my reproductive endocrinologist, and Dr. L, my ob gyn -- decided that P must be a more-highly observed baby, as if that were possible after at least two dozen ultrasounds. So for six weeks in April and May, I left work and waddled to the hospital on Wednesday afternoons, sometimes bringing galley proofs to read in bed, and registered as if I were staying. Then I had an ultrasound, and went upstairs to Labor and Delivery for a non-stress test.  What is a non-stress test? Many of you know. You lie there quietly and think about how in a few weeks you'll be lying there in the worst pain of your life, and they give you a glass of apple juice, and they monitor the baby's heartbeat for an hour.  While there, you listen to lots of moaning and babies being born and cheering. That is a wonder. You wish it were your turn, so you could get it over with and finally gaze upon your own feet in the first time in months.  P's birth was scheduled for my due date. My disease carries a high incidence of gestational diabetes, which can appear at any time, and though I was screened for it monthly (and in a 3-hour-glucose tolerance test at 28 weeks, most people only have to do the half-hour one) they didn't want the placenta to become post-mature. The baby can die from a postmature placenta in a high risk mother, so if she didn't make her appearance beforehand I would be induced.  Do you mind induction? one nincompoop asked. Isn't it unnatural?  "Are you kidding me?" I said. "This entire  baby  was contrived through unnatural means. Who am I to stand on nature's side now? It didn't do anything for me in the past! Bring on the drugs! More, more, I want more!"  However,I will say that in my anaesthesia preregistration, I said no narcotics. They make me throw up, and you know how much I hate that.  I had seen a birth before, by the way -- my nephew. Natural birth. Between blood curdling screams, my sister-in-law panted, "Is this scaring you away from having your own baby?"  "No," I replied. "It's scaring me away from having my own baby  without drugs ."  We went to the birthing classes -- those are hilarious. Nineteen apple-cheeked women who need help getting up, and nineteen reluctant guys in flannel shirts who try to feign a modicum of interest -- until the lights are lowered and the breastfeeding video commences.  Is it me or did they show a lot of gratuituous (I nearly wrote gratu tit ous) footage in this video? I think I saw one baby -- in the introduction. Other than that, it was all boobs, all the time. All it needed was a pulsing techno soundtrack.  There was a gradual shifting and settling in the room, as if the men now knew they'd come to the right place. S was riveted. He knew more about breastfeeding than me when the video was done.  But anyway, the rest of the stuff they tell you in birthing class -- pointless.  So by the time I arrived for my induction, at 10 PM on a Monday night -- May 8, 2000 -- with Dr. L's words in my head: "you're not effaced and you're not dilated, so it will be like starting a car in the snow -- you'll have a baby by Wednesday afternoon, most likely" -- I was woefully unprepared, rather like someone who got their degree in Advanced Microsurgery by mail order by sending in boxtops and a rubber band.  It had gotten hot over the weekend, and since I was "as big as a house" (this a direct quote from my father), the anonymous heatrash was back. I had spent the weekend, fact, semi clothed with mini fans pointed at various strategic points of my gigantic person, eating ramen noodles and watching movies, with my social worker mother in law by my side. I only had one outfit that fit that was weather appropriate -- the black tank and shorts, I still wear it to bed, you should see it now.  Thank God she came from Toledo to take care of me at the end! I had a certified therapist by my side for the last five days of my pregnancy. We talked about the following fears I had:  1. Will I die? 2. Will the baby die? 3. I don't care if it hurts but will I be able to stand it if it hurts? And what if I die? Then who will take care of the baby? 4.  What was I thinking, doing this in the first place?   5. I want my mommy!!!!     I will love her all my life for listening to that for five days.  The weekend before, I found myself leaning over chairs a lot. My back hurt. I knew it was because an entire human was days from emerging from my abdomen, but I didn't also know that was my body getting ready for labor. It was something happening.  Here's how it went down:  10:30 PM: Emergency room nurse takes one look at me and says, "Labor and delivery?" I nod and off we go.  10:40 PM: I put on the heinous blue gown with the open back and the little anchor print, with a matching peignoir (another gown reversed).  10:45 PM: S begins channel surfing. They have graciously provided him with two naugahyde slingback chairs for his sleeping comfort.  11:00 PM: The first of 10,000 people arrives to flip up the heinous blue gown and probe about in my internal apparatus.  11:30 PM: An ob who looks about my age ("you'll like her," Dr. L, now home tucked snugly into bed no doubt, assured me previously) sticks a pill that's supposed to bring it on  up there .  11:45 PM: One of the handmaidens makes me swallow a sleeping pill "to take the edge off." They hook up a monitor and there is P's heart -- swoosh swoosh swoosh. A miracle! S turns off the light -- we're supposed to sleep.  Midnight. The swooshing is driving us insane. We turn the monitor down.  12:10 AM: They come back in and turn the monitor up.  12:11 AM: We turn it back down.  12:30 AM: I fall into a twilight sleep in my bed, which S is cursing me for having because the naugahyde is sticking to his legs. I ask if he wants to climb into bed with me. He says, "No, you're too big for me to fit."  1:30 AM: The teen doctor comes in and "checks the pill." "I'm going to strip your membranes now," she says. "It hasn't even dissolved at all."  Q: What does membrane stripping feel like? A: Select the sharp object of your choice and sit on it, taking care to make sure it penetrates the most tender part of your skin and goes inside your body. Wiggle around on this object for about thirty seconds until you're ready to faint. That's what it feels like.  2:00 AM: A polar bear is chewing on my spine.  2:01 AM: We get up and walk down the hall. Sleepless mothers are watching the weather channel in darkened rooms in the nursery section. I am the only imbecile here tonight actually having a baby. But that will change -- the nursery will be chockablock by the time P gets here, and everyone will have come in after me and have had nice tidy C's where you get to see the baby immediately.  3:30: I must've passed out for ten minutes. The goddamned polar bear, would he stop that fucking gnawing!  3:45: Great. Now my ovary's exploding. This is all I need. S does some pointless, semi-placating rubs on my back. This is akin to putting vaseline on a bullet wound and hoping for the best.  4:00: Teen doctor probes and yawns and says she'll see me later on, someone else is coming on call, but boy I look good. I am getting there. I should have a baby by afternoon. Look at those contractions! No more walking around, now. She turns up the monitor. We turn it back down after she goes.  4:10 Yes. Look at those contractions.  4:30: S: (rustling the report) That one went up to  ninety!   4:31:   I  know.     5:25: It's about time this bastard got here with his needles and his drugs. Hurry up, damn you, you fucking people. If I weren't so tired this wouldn't only be an interior monologue.  5:30: You're doing beautifully. Holding up with such grace, Rose.  5:31: To the tune of "Row, Row, Row Your Boat:" Fuck fuck a fucky duck, fuck a doodle doo. When you get yourself knocked up, this is what you'll do.  Shit. I used "do" twice, must get better rhyme for  do . UGH Maaaaw. Karen was wrong -- this is worse than the sigmoidoscopy. The goddamn  gnawing ! Oh, God, saints preserve me -- God, God, God, where are you, where are you, where are you, be here now  please .  5:32 Ah God. What have I done.  6:00: ahhhhhhhh. Bliss. The polar bear has gone back in his igloo. What the fuck? Polar bears don't live in igloos, you stupid, stupid woman.  6:45: Dr. L comes with his hook and breaks the water. If I had known it was just like a pick-up stick that could do the whole thing in, I'd've been more careful during my pregnancy when sitting down.  7:00: S: Well, if you don't need me, I'm going to go mosey down and get some breakfast.  7:01: You do that, you stinking rotten . .. why can't any words come out of my mouth? Why do I keep smiling at everyone?  9:00: Phone begins ringing. This time sister-in-law. She shows up with a camera. Weeks later I will wish to burn the "before" pictures of me.  9:30: -How's it going in here? -Fine. Is this it? I feel so good I think my heart will stop. The drug's just going everywhere. Do I have legs? -You do. That's great. It's working. -I feel blissful. -That's part of it. -Is this it? I mean, it got bad during the night, but is this it? I feel so  good.  -This is it! You'll just feel a little pressure now. First babies take a long time to come out. You'll be pushing a good long while. Don't worry, you'll do great.  -How long?!  -Oh, I'd say an hour and a half at the least. Try not to worry. Everything's fine.  9:45: This is called pitocin. It'll get things moving -- I'm just going to find a line here, my goodness your veins are weak.  10:00: We're going to put this special monitor on the baby's head. How does this heart monitor keep getting turned down?  10:15: Let me just have a look here . .. .  10:45: I'll need to empty your bladder.  11:00 Ah. The Price is Right. Bob Barker always calms me down.  11:01. Wait a minute. I think I need something else. I'm feeling it again.Can I get something else? What is taking him so long? -He's with other patients. -Goddamn it, get someone else! I don't want this again.  11:02: (hear sister in law whispering on phone): She's doing well, but she's getting  very impatient . Yes. Impatient. Yes.  11:30: That's better. But why isn't it working as well this time? Ah God, I have to push something out. Something!  11:45: You can start, hon. Start pushing. Where's the doctor? He won't be here until the baby crowns. What? Why bother hiring anyone? We'll take care of you. Just do your thing.  12:00 I push in sets of three, with S and sis-in-law (also S) with their annoying counting at my ears. Looking up at my reflection in the tv, I see some awful nightmare in my undercarriage, so I ask them to turn it aside.  12:30: There's a lip on your cervix that won't . . .the baby's head. There was some meconium stain . . .it could've been from weeks ago. Doesn't necessarily mean. Pneumonia. Bob Barker. Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven.  Shut the fuck up, shut up, shut up, shut up! Why can't I talk!   12:45: Well, I don't know why her forearm is black. Oh no, look at that IV -- totally infiltrated. Why weren't you looking out for this? Do the other arm.  1:00 I don't know why your first push is so weak, your second is good and your third is weak. You need to . ... effort now.  1:15 I can't talk. I don't feel like being here anymore. Maybe if I skip one set of pushes, they won't know . . .! They might not know, that's what I'll do, I'll skip -- wait, they have that damn monitor, if I could just kick it out of the way, they wouldn't. Ah, whatever, here I go. Okay, forget this room. I'm at work, I'm working on a catalog. There's the phone. Good morning, it's me. Yes? The print run? 30,000? Wait a minute, I'll be back in a sec.  1:16 Not this goddamned room again with these fucking counting people.  1:25 I see the head. Call the doctor! She has hair! Oh, it's so sweet!  1:26: Call the doctor? Call him? Isn't he here? Shouldn't he be here?  1:27: Thanks for holding, Joan. Okay, it was four color. Yes, three signatures. It's a big book! hahaha. I know. Just do the matte through the whole thing, I'll do an eighth bleed of that beige -- that'll save on the stock. Use a fifty pound. Yeah -- I don't know. I think you should do a spot varnish on that one spot. I wanted the bottle for the cover, the reflection in the bottle, like life being looked at and regarded from a distance, a metaphor for the experience. I'm sorry. Can you hold on?  1:30: S ties on the doctor's gown. I haven't screamed. Not once.  1:36: The cord is around her neck, so I want you to give one big push -- we need that now.  1:38 Panic returns and I rent myself in twain. A great, big, giant thing that feels like a head comes out of me.  1:39: Now get the rest of her out. That was simple.  1:40: I scream and cheer and cry all at once: she's here, she's here!  1:41: I hear sucking. And sucking. No crying. A minute. Then one. A cry. A cry! We got those lungs cleaned out nice. Oh, look at this beautiful girl. So beautiful. My heart folds and snaps. Don't worry, honey, nice and pink. Here she is! Here she is! S brings her to me, shows her to me.  1:42: That's the afterbirth. Just one more gentle push. That's it. Good job, Mommy.  1:45 Lie still for the stitching. You were doing so well before.  1:50: Who cares about your stitching! Give her to me, give her to me. Here she is. Hi, little one. Oh holy Jesus. Oh St. Jude. Oh blessed Mother. Oh thank you father God. Oh, you're so pretty. Oh, your beautiful eyes. Oh, I love you, I love you, I love you so much. You're here. Oh, my baby. Hallelujah, you're really here.

      My name is really Rose. No, really.  Well, really, my given name is longer than that. It is a rose compound. It is often -- actually always -- mispronounced. And misspelled. It is a terrible, fussy, frumpy, old-fashioned name, more suited to someone in the world who is at this very moment playing shuffleboard on a cruise ship, wearing lime-colored polyester slacks with a permanent crease.  S calls me after a certain winter vegetable that makes a hearty soup. That's what a couple of my email accounts are under, and I nearly named the blog after the humble root for the novelty value that's in it. However, I was shocked to learn it was already taken by another blogger! Impossible to believe.  I hated my real name as a kid, by the way. Too cumbersome: not a cheerleader's name. Well, I wasn't much of a cheerleader, but the one year my dad made me do cheerleading (to make me into a team player -- yet another misguided parenting tactic), everyone had to shout out their name at the end of a cheer, and my name didn't work. Had I been Stacey! Or Lacey! Or Macey! Or Candy! It might have worked better . . .but being who I was . . . I felt like I was saying Gertrude. Or Henrietta. Or Hazelnut Meadowsweet. Or Berthilda.  I have for some reason always inspired people to feats of vocal styling, and so throughout my childhood, if I uttered my full name, I was treated to the full Vegas regalia of a long-ago hit song by middle-aged men I met in garish living rooms while collecting money for my brother's paper route. Did they think they were making me feel at home? I felt like a freak. I hate being the center of attention; I like being the person in the corner next to the crab dip, taking copious notes between bites.  So back to the blog. When I got into this gig and had to register it, after the abject vegetable failure, I was forced to try various combinations of Rose. I figured, why shouldn't people know who I am? I may be anonymous, but I'm not ashamed. But Rose and my year of birth wasn't available, nor was Rosebud (taken by a  Citizen Kane  junkie?), Rosalie, Rosalind, Rosemunde or any other permutation I've used over the years.  Then I thought about what happens now when people call me by my full, ridiculous name, and I instruct them instead: "I'm just Rose."  I typed it in, and here I am.

      Score:  Justrose: 1 Transient Pinkish Orange: 1  We're tied.  I broke down and bought a new curtain liner ($2.99 at Pathmark, metal grommets, no chads) and actually laundered the cloth curtain on the outside. Before I reinstalled it (P wanted the novelty rings, but I held firm), I sat on the edge of the tub and tackled the TPO once more with a sigh of resignation.  My weapon of choice? Clorox Clean-Up wipes. ALa71's suggestion.  Going between each line of tile, TPO kept cropping up where heretofore it hadn't been, like the munchkins in the Wizard of Oz. I scrubbed gamely on. Fairycat supervised from the back of the toilet.  I did an okay job. It looks a little better. I especially tried to secure the border near the curtain to avoid fraternization.  Entrenched Black ceded some of its sliminess, but none of its hue.

      I jotted down this list while I was sitting on the toilet (dressed, with the lid closed) waiting for P to be done her Scooby Doo game in the bathtub -- it was an elaborate plot in which I heard her say at one point, "Mommy's all alone in the rainstorm outside and I have Daddy all to myself hahahaha!"   The mommy was represented by a rubber bullfrog. The daddy was a plastic cheetah.  That's for another post, I guess.  Anyway, here are some questions that I'll be damned if I'll ever know the answer to, but they're germane to life in the Rowhouse.  1. Why can't I ever find a pen that works? (this as I sat there drawing curlicues of dust for five minutes with the only pen I could find)  2. Where do all the socks go?  3. Why does the cat throw up in my shoe right when I'm about to leave?  4. Why is the living room rug crusty?  5. What  is  that thing behind the refrigerator?  6. No one else's outside drains have leaves and mud caked in them, curtailing drainage -- discuss.  7. The quantity and coarseness of hair on the bathroom floor obviously belongs to a creature that lurks somewhere unseen in the Rowhouse. Explain.  8. Why does the phone always ring as soon as I sit on the toilet?  9. Why does the cute Fed Ex guy always show up when I have bedhead?  10. How do the credit card companies find us?  11. Where  is  the scotch tape?  12. Why does S drink all the bourbon?  13. Why am I the only resident who cares about . . . a. Christmas decorations? b. Christmas cards? c. whether there is milk in the house?  14. Why does someone always need something as soon as I crack open a book?  15. Why do I never get to drink any cup of tea I brew?

      I discovered to my delight at the stuffed pepper dinner party several weeks ago that my aunt's and my chosen epitaphs are remarkably similar. She's had hers about 20 years, I've had mine around ten.   Mine:  IT WAS NEVER EASY, GODDAMN IT   Hers:  I NEVER UNDERSTOOD A GODDAMN THING  I knew I liked her especially for a reason.

      1. One of the teachers at P's school, a svelte yet fit-looking woman, had with her two lunch containers -- one with a cup of cubed watermelon, the other with about a quarter cup of chicken salad in some kind of dressing.  If that's all they eat to look that way, forget it.  2. I had elastic failure in my underwear in the Pathmark checkout line. One moment everything was battened down and the next: pop! I nearly started laughing out loud. This is the sort of luck I have: getting stung by bees in my bed in the middle of the night, falling on my ass in front of people I want to impress, stepping in dog dirt in sandals, wearing a smear of ice cream on whatever shirt I have on. Fortuitously I had shorts on so it wasn't a complete drop-trou. I was able to correct the problem once we reached the car with some hasty adjustments.  3. Some LUNATIC in a jeep kept playing chicken with me turning off the boulevard onto Tyson Avenue. When you're making that left off the boulevard, you just need to wait your turn. I was going straight across. He was already in a lane, but no! Not good enough! He wanted to be in MY lane so he wouldn't have to wait for other people making lefts ONTO the boulevard. I paused to let him go, he hung back, I started to go, he jumped up, I slammed on my brakes and he missed me by an inch. I yelled "ASSHOLE!" at the window clearly enough for even elementary lip-readers to discern, then felt terrible. He wasn't really old but old enough for me to have to respect, given my puritanical upbringing. Anyway, he flipped me off and his wife did too, so I guess he deserved it.

       He who created the heavens and stretched them out who spread out the earth and all that comes out of it who gives breath to its people and life to those who walk on it.   Isaiah 42:5 (NIV)   The sun gamely pressed through as I drove from Anonymous Rowhouse Road to Preschool Street. The ride seemed long; I felt so observant, the reason I couldn't sleep last night. I'm speeding a little bit, buzzing from the jolt of all the writing I'm doing. When I'm really working -- the way I am on this blog, writing and writing and writing -- I never shut off. I write in my head. I write when I'm loading the dishwasher. I write when I'm brushing P's hair. So I was noticing, and noticing, and noticing the things that looked more beautiful now because the sun was on them.  There were blue wildflowers on a temple lawn, shaped like little lunchboxes, stretching up in the light.  There was a garden with lavender so high it topped the fence, and an old lady was watering it lovingly.  There were container trees all in a row along someone's curb, proud and tall with all the rain.  There was dark earth beneath the trees as P and I walked down to her school from where I parked. Sprinkled among the pines were a few snapdragons that obviously weren't planted -- seeds flew and landed there.  "What that bubble flower?" P said.  I knew she would love this -- dragons are her favorite thing (paging the Dungeon Master, whose DNA comprises half her person) so I leaned down to it and said, "It's called a snapdragon. See what happens when you pinch it? It opens its mouth."  I think someone might have been watching nefariously from the shadow of the house's entryway, but I didn't care. I touched it anyway.  "Wow!"  P tried to pinch it too. "Snapping dragon flower!"  The flower was lovely and quiet in the shade, and yellow as a beach kite.  P talked on and on about it as we continued the short walk to school. And I remembered when I discovered snapdragons, too -- my mother had them in clusters of pink and white in the walled garden along the driveway. I loved their little speckled tongues and their soft petals.  I wrote a poem in college about my mother hanging laundry in the summer mornings, a vivid memory for me, the bands of wet sheet slapping around our bare legs as I handed her clothespins. One of the lines of the poem was, "the snapdragons watched. And the bees."  And I felt as I stood there with P in the cold, delicious shade of the pines, on this quite ordinary Tuesday on a city street with the morning traffic sloughing by, that one more thing I thought had been taken from me with my mother's death indeed had not.

       . . . .is what my mother used to say when the sun came out after a long hiatus. Unfortunately, I'm not saying that today. Again. This summer has blown, bit, sucked, whatever disgusting verb you want to use to describe absolutely crappy weather. I feel like I live in England; it rains constantly, and the sky is a uniform sodden silver every single day, but plus vile humidity. It's the beginning of August -- August of wide searing skies and endless blue -- and I'm going to have to use my SAD HappyLite (which usually doesn't get turned on until September) to keep from feeling like I want to eat vats of stew before crawling into a hole for the winter (which is what I do every September).  The heat says, "slice and eat an avocado on spinach with feta" while the sky says, "it's time for curried parsnip soup." It doesn't matter anyway; I have a huge project to get done for work today, so I'll be here in the basement (when I'm not ferrying P back and forth).  But the Rowhouse's sun-fried container garden is turning into the pond garden, and there's been so much flooding that the meteorologists say, "The sponge can't take much more." People in canoes next to their houses, where their street used to be, have not been uncommon in recent weeks.  Thank God it hasn't been like that on Anonymous Rowhouse Road, but we have had some wicked rain.  P went with me to my counseling appointment last night as S was still at work. She was very good! She brought a huge bag of creatures and nudged around for a while, but eventually she found my counselor's fake flower display which she took apart ("Is that an ikebana arrangement?" I said as P destroyed it. She said no, it had no particular spiritual significance.) P moaned for the fake fern she named Bammy and asked if she could come with me again. I said if Daddy wasn't home to watch her -- she likes him much better than me, so I doubt she'd give up the chance to hang out with him to play with a fake fern.  It looks like I'm not going to the Christian writer's conference. A. We have no money and B. I don't think the timing's right. I wrote to the conference director last night, and I think she's going to give me a refund, which would be a very, very good thing. I can think of approximately 250 things that I could use that money for urgently, spinach and feta among them.  More later as I come up for air between the tedium of my project, which I've been putting off to have fun here.

      I have something of an insomnia problem.  If I let my brain come to for even an instant -- I am up, for sometimes three or four hours during the night.  S says it's habit; it's not really. I've been doing much better lately. But here I am at 2:17 AM and I have to get up at seven with P to take her to school.  What to do until then . . . I don't feel like watching a movie, or listening to music, or eating, or even spinning a yarn. I wonder if I go up and lie back down, will I rehash my life's regrets until 5:45, or fall back to sleep promptly . . .?  It's a quandary.  Sleep experts recommend that people with insomnia get up and do something instead of lying there in bed, until they get tired again. I used to try to put myself to sleep by reading Marcus Aurelius or other dry-as-a-dishrag literary classics, but even that doesn't work. I have to wait until I'm good and tired again.  Luckily the Rowhouse is a cozy place to wile away the night, asleep or awake.

      "You will not," my mother said, "like summer camp."  "Oh, but I will!" I insisted. What could be more fun -- I was ten years old. I wanted to go somewhere where you could tip a canoe, speak in an affected fashion about a constant stream of inside jokes, and not have anyone breathing down my neck about having to take a shower. Also, I wanted to ride a horse. The horseback riding class was an extra twenty five dollars. Raised in the urban jungle, my idea of wildlife was a rat I saw in the subway tunnel once -- big enough to need its own saddle, sauntering by during morning rush hour, scoffing at the third rail, just as casual as you please.  Camp Holymountain was a bit of a surprise and a shock, I'll admit, being as I was used to my mother's coddling. Even though I was ten, I had no idea how to cut my own meat or comb my own hair -- that's how I much I was still my mom's baby. ALa71, on the other hand, who was going too, had been self-sufficent and caring for her siblings singlehandedly for years, so she was much more possessed of a wilderness mentality.  It was an all-girls Christian camp, so no funny business of the sort my secular, all-summer-camp-attending-since-they-were-six friends at school had told me about. No sneaking off to the boys' side or anything of the sort. There was no boys' side, or was there? I can't remember. I never saw a boy the entire time we were on the mountain. Not that I cared at that point in my life.  ALa71 and I were in different cabins. All of the counselors were named after birds -- mine was Cardinal, and ALa71's was inexplicably Tweety. Cardinal was older and reserved; and Tweety was bucolic and nearly military in her directives (they had "brush and flush" after every meal).  This is the moment I realized I would never be able to go into the military no matter what the fast-talking ROTC recruiter would say years later -- he called me many times. ("I can't do a push up," I invariably told him -- he was a lovely man, with a low, convincing voice, but it's still true.) I simply cannot utilize facilities, eat, sleep and partake in activities in tandem with other people. I must be able to function on my own schedule or nothing.  I loved riding the horses -- mine was a gigantic appaloosa with an attitude problem named Kiowa. I worked on him with tenderness, and by the end of the week he was a honey and I won a silver horseshoe for learning to ride him. I loved walking in the woods and the crazy foster-care girls who invaded the quonset hut and stole costumes and left them all muddy by the lake. I loved learning to whittle in a treehouse from a counselor named Tree Duck. I loved, and amazingly had a flair for, air riflery. I bought a cute blue shirt with a teddy bear on it with money my mom had sent. And I spent the rest of the money on rice krispie squares in the shop, because I was always hungry. I especially liked the morning devotional time, where I sat alone with God in nature for the first time in my life, a thing I still love to do today.  My mind may have been twirling on a string like a playful kite, but the rest of my system had seized up. I would not go to the bathroom on a schedule, no sir. So it was on Thursday -- I arrived Sunday -- that I finally presented myself to the nurse in the middle of the night, and she gasped and prodded my stomach and made me drink about a gallon of milk of magnesia. Then she sent me back to my cabin, where everyone else slept on in peace, the lucky buggers.  I woke Cardinal an hour later and we plodded down the hill to the bathroom, where the milk of magnesia magnesed its way through my intestines until morning. Poor Cardinal. I remember her yawning and leaning against the sinks and saying as kindly as she could, "Take your time, sweetheart. I don't have a train to catch." I was so sick; had the bathroom not been filled with the kinds of vile bugs that are attracted to light, not to mention the mice that frequented the trashcans, I would've been inclined to creep out of the stall and lie on the cool floor with my cheek against it.  The nurse's words came to me: "Next time, come to me Tuesday about this."  I was so sick, in fact, that I had to be marched back down the hill even further to the nurse again, who was very happy to see me. This time, she made me drink a gallon of Pepto Bismol.  And so the week went on.  We hiked a mountain; I remember dishes of runoff under the water fountains that said, "This is for the animals." I remember doing corn on the cob on a campfire. I remember only taking two showers the entire time and fashioning my hair into some sort of knotty semblance resembling a ponytail.  When we got home, my mother took one look at me, sucked in her breath, plunked me in the tub and scrubbed me raw with three changes of water.  And when she left me clean and in a towel, I locked the door and settled on the toilet with a smile for some quality private time.

      I know I say this blog is apolitical, but I must share the results of the only time I have ever written to legislators about anything, which I got from the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network today:   FAAN is pleased to announce that, thanks to all of your hard work and support, the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act (FALCPA) has been passed by both Houses of Congress and is expected to be signed into law by President Bush.   Can I please tell you how wonderful this is. This means that all companies will be MANDATED to place on their labeling the presence of the eight major food allergens, of which my daughter is allergic to five. Right now, their compliance is voluntary. That means that every time we feed her something new from a package, the companies aren't required to list whether those allergens are present in things like "natural and artificial flavors." Or "spices." They're not required to say if the product is manufactured in the same plant as the allergens. I could give her something perfectly "safe," according to the ingredient list, right after they ran something else containing peanuts or milk. Some companies are forthcoming about their practices, but not all. Which are? Which aren't? Who knows?  So we need to sweat whether her throat is going to close or not. Every new food. Every first bite. This is why we stick to a core group of foods, all of which I've called each company about individually. This is why my daughter's diet is so limited. This is why we stick to manufacturers like glue. Soy milk -- all different kinds. But I know for a fact that even though Silk is manufactured in a milk plant -- have you ever heard of a soymilk plant? -- every BATCH is tested for milk protein. That is assurance. This is a kid that ate a drop of milk once in a batter who we found nearly out cold a minute later. It's not just me being a neurotic.  Can you imagine, worrying that you might die if you eat something -- and then all of a sudden, knowing whether or not it is safe to have because the government mandates all the labeling? This is a miracle for us. It won't take effect until January of 2006, but man when it does -- what a sigh of relief. There is a God.

      I have parlayed our nonexistent funds into a miniature vacation for the residents of the Rowhouse, commencing the last week of August for three nights.  Okay, it's just Jersey, and okay, it's a motor inn (we have to get a kitchen so we can cook P's food) and okay, we really DON'T have the money -- but it's on my terms. We had chucked around going to stay at a friend of a friend of a friend's place in Ocean City, MD. That fell through, so here we are.  My favorite part: waking up at 5:30, sneaking out of the room, walking three blocks up to the beach, sitting there and saying my rosary by the water.  Apart from the weird old guys out with their metal detectors, it'll be just me, the pewter tides, the opal sky. Bliss.

      I started a post about traveling in Spain when I was 18, which was an amusing story in itself, but then the phone rang and rang again, which is lovely, but writing about my past and all its rich tapestries is not where I am today.  Another dishwater day in Philadelphia -- humid as hell, I'm a walking heat rash, and all the Gold Bond powder in the world can't change it until the weather breaks. S working late -- AGAIN, which just means I have twelve straight hours to fill with . . .what? Plenty of things suggest themselves, none of which I feel like doing.  P is being an albatross, a barnacle, one of those birds that sit on the rhinos' backs, pick your thing that rubber cements itself to you and allows you not enough space to even breathe or think. I know she's bored. I know she wants me to take her someplace where she can either spend money we don't have or play with other kids. Will I get any points in heaven in the quest for the perfect playdate on her behalf? It's not like it used to be; lots of parents work and you have to plan this stuff. I know I should be upstairs making some Martha Stewart craft with her, and I guess I will go do that. But first I need to get my head on straight so I can do it with a spring to my step and love in my heart.  Some days, I must confess, riddled with guilt -- the obverse of the parenting coin -- I feel like saying, I didn't sign up to hang out with a four-year-old every waking moment of every day! I understand why women go back to work full time, some days. They might also feel guilty for different reasons, but ah! A desk and work to do, and a phone to answer and be professional on! People to say, "Nice job!" People to say, "Want to go to get Skittles from the machine?" People to say, "You finished the project!"  The parenting job is never finished. The laundry job is never finished. The dishwasher job -- as we all know -- is  never finished; and so one's psyche becomes perpetual "construction zone." The caution tape and yellow barrels never come down.  And no little voice going, "No! Your computer is turning into a crocodile! You can't sit near it ANYMORE! I want chips! I want Scooby Doo movie! I want that Goose Bumps book we saw in the triplets' car! We'll go buy it NOW! It is not out of print! It is not for big kids! It WON'T scare me! You make toys of it NOW! You draw and cut out monsters and paint them for me NOW! No! I don't want stuff off the computer! That page didn't print out the way I wanted it! I want soymilk! I have to go peepee! The kitty threw up! Over there . ..  you clean it up NOW! Ewww!There's someone at the door! I want a piece of cake! I spilled water on my shirt! I want my dinosaurs! Let's bake cookies! Mommy, we have a big problem, I have a hangnail! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Mooooooommmmmy!"  I'm so easy to please, even when I'm grumpy. I just want a whole day to myself, right here in the Rowhouse. With no one to answer to and nothing to clean, where I can sit on the sofa all day long and read excerpts of books I love, eating about six pounds of Cadbury chocolate without gaining any weight. While eating and reading, I can feel secure that wherever P is, she's having a better time than she could be having with me.  I remember my mother saying she no longer answered to the name "Mommy." She would say, "Help! Don't help. Go play!" And at the time I thought that was harsh -- wasn't I her boon companion and little helper, following her everywhere all the livelong day? -- but now I know in my bones the frustration behind her ranting.  My sister-in-law says, "Paybacks are a bitch."  It is nice to be needed. It is nice to be the center of someone's universe. But, as the child grows cognitively, they become more and more clever. Even as teeny babies, you can see the wheels turning --  how much can I get her to do for me without my having to exert any effort ? So as they grow,  there is a greater distinction between Mommy, provider and nurturer, and Mommy, doormat who will walk ten flights of steps in ten minutes to keep digging a toy out from behind the sofa that I keep deliberately putting there so I can amuse myself by watching her walk up and down the steps.  Thanks for listening. I have had this five minutes of peace and I think I'm ready to tackle The Day: Act II.

      So say, for the sake of argument, that the conversation turns to my brothers.  How their far-reaching impact smolders on in my gut like a hastily-eaten hot sausage with peppers and onions on a long roll! So good going down, and it seemed like a good idea at the time -- but at three AM -- where's the Maalox?  No, it wasn't that bad. Really.  Just a little background, I know I've probably said this before but I am the youngest and the only girl. My mother and father married young -- it was her second marriage, his first, and got on with the business of peopling the earth nearly immediately.  M was born first. M is a severe asthmatic and so spent half his childhood in an oxygen tent. He's lean and sardonic. He is a shrewd and ballsy ice hockey player. He is possessed of a deep and rare affection for me which expresses itself best in the following birthday card I received from him in 2002:   (cover) I hope you know how much having a sister like you means to me.    (interior) Because chances are, I'm not going to tell you.   M was the protective one -- the one who bought me Pez dispensers for helping me with his paper route -- the one stood apart from the other two and actually appeared to care whether I lived or died.  M also liked to mess with my head, so one day he lay down in the middle of Central Avenue during rush hour while I stood on the curb and cried for him to come back! He thought it was funny.  I called M after a fluffy beloved animal because he looks like one. Some people still call him that. He turned 40 this year.  M used to come home from work -- he was cooking in a hospital kitchen in those days -- and repair upstairs with his underwear on his head for a "Shit. Shower." One time, second brother S was on the phone while fixing something on the stove and wearing an oven mitt.  M glanced at the stove and said to S calmly, "Glove's on fire," and continued on.  To this day, M is nothing if not laconic. Once a year he finds his voice and we speak for something like forty five minutes. In between, if he needs you, he calls your answering machine, says his name, and hangs up.  S was the problem child -- right in the middle. He didn't have a chip on his shoulder -- he had a whole bucket of gravel. He mouthed off, goofed off, and pretended to go to school while waiting for my mother to leave, so he could come back home and watch Bugs Bunny and Marcus Welby, MD reruns all day. My mother called his high school graduation "the mockery."  S was pretty nice but possessed of a wolverine's temper. So he didn't like it too much that summer when I took all the money off his bureau and spent it on candy, but he got over it eventually.  One time he ran away on the fire ladder (leaving a note for my parents that said "I've gone") and went to the movies and watched a movie about Jesus five times in a row.  One time he fell asleep halfway into the hamper. In the middle of the night. Why he felt possessed to put his dirty clothes in it then, we'll never know.  S is pictured in fifth grade wearing a purple point-collared dress shirt with a big patch of calamine on his face. He had poison ivy and no one had the sense to wipe it off.  K, the one who is two years older than me and whom I graduated from high school with owing to my flagrant skipping, was rather like my twin. He told people we weren't related.  He was also a torturer's apprentice. I would regularly find my dolls strung in nooses.  K was jealous of my intellectual prowess. He always got by on charm alone. All my friends wanted to date him. He looks a little like Matt Damon. It made me sick.  K and I went to school downtown for several years together, and he always made me walk three paces behind him. It came in handy when he was getting jumped by local vagrants, which happened several times, as I was always able to fade into the background while they were pounding the crap out of him.  Once he had a dream in which he said aloud, "I like it when the covers are folded," and we've never left him alone about it.  K mocked and taunted me in front of his friends but would always play Chinese jacks with me if no one was around.  ALa71's earliest memory of my brothers is of our mothers sending us someplace with them, with the brothers ostensibly in charge. It couldn't be further from the truth. They didn't care whether we got run over or what. If they took a bike ride with a friend, I often ended up on the handlebars like some expendable hood ornament.  Anyway, ALa71's memory jogged mine, too, and the line that she said she remembered as they stalked on ahead of us through the urban jungle, murmured low and menacingly, as a directive.  " Keep up ."

      I was just upstairs playing "dolls" with P. The dolls were Frog and Toad from the Arnold Lobel series -- P doesn't like actual human dolls. ALa71 found them in Barnes and Noble yesterday, and I had to have them, I mean I thought P would really like them. They are about 8" tall stuffed felt, and they are wearing tiny faux wool dinner jackets with nonmatching trousers. They have tiny sewn eyes and are wearing identical daft expressions from the books. They're adorable.  Frog and Toad were at an amusement park, P told me, and they were riding the dinosaur slides which we constructed out of her substantial rubber dinosaur collection. There is also a hideous viper head that makes up part of a novelty roller coaster I got her for Christmas from Lillian Vernon -- they were riding that, too.  Eventually I found a board book that has scenes of safety -- the bathroom, backyard pool, kitchen, etc. and we had them play in that. There was a mall scene and we had them purchase parrots, jump ropes and pizza from the mall. It was dead boring, but hilarious to hear what comes out of P's mouth, and I tried cleaning up the living room while making the endless plot plod on.  But I was still thinking about the Journey post, and my dusty childhood room with the cape cod slanted walls and the pine panelling, and all of a sudden it came to me: the Anonymous Dollhouse.  I didn't like dolls, either, as a preschooler. My grandmother bought the granddaughters beautiful Madame Alexanders -- I'm sure Maidink's are still mint-in-box somewhere and worth a fortune.  My mom thought it was ridiculous to keep a plaything in a box to rot, no matter what an heirloom it supposedly was. So she gave me mine to play with, and I immediately stripped off their dainty garments, jettisoned the dolls themselves onto the toybox pile without a second's regard, and dressed my monkey bean bags in their finery. So it went for a couple more years: I only, like my P now, cared about animals.  But all that was about to change.  One of my mother's best friends was an artist that worked in 1:12 scale miniatures, which he handcrafted for sales around the world. He specifically made dollhouse furniture: Louis XIV chairs, toile couches, colonial tables, the delicate spindles of canopy beds.  One Christmas my dad went down the hill to his workshop and came back up with a dollhouse he'd made for me. At first, I played like any five-year-old would in a dollhouse: here is a mommy, here's the baby, give the baby her porridge blah blah blah.  Eventually, it kind of rotted in the corner. I stuffed it with monkey bean bags. My parents' attempt to make me a normal girl had failed.  Until I turned eight.  My mother adored Andrew Jackson for some reason and her dream was to have a replica of his ancestral home The Hermitage in dollhouse form. For some reason my parents thought this would be best managed as a gift to me. I don't know whether they thought I would just play with my mom's display, so they might as well get it over with and give it to me, or what.  But on my eighth Christmas I got a handmade dollhouse -- my father's work -- based on the Hermitage; a spectacular manse with parquet floors, a spiral staircase and working electricity. It even had a little ceramic bathroom with a pull-tank toilet.  I know in today's world this is nothing spectacular -- Barbie has an aircraft she pilots herself AND a Lamborghini she bought with her own money, working construction next to the boys -- but in the dark ages of 1979 this was truly a work of brilliance.  ALa71 and I were to play that thing to death over the next four -- and if we admitted it, five -- years. The little dollhouse I got when I was five became a lesser rental property for the less-important dolls.  The new one was no ordinary dollhouse, you see. From minute one, we never treated it like the Hermitage, white gauze hand-embroidered matelasses be damned. It was a boarding house, plain and simple, and the posse that corrupted it was the Honey Hill Bunch.  Do you remember them? They of the rickety rig? I wasn't supposed to have them. My mother, garage sale denizen, had picked up an "Our Gang" clubhouse stuffed with six of the dolls in a bag for a dollar fifty at a sale on Hasbrook Avenue. I wanted the clubhouse, of course -- it came with that Little Rascals dog -- but the rag dolls within were an amazing bonus.  The main protagonists of the Anonymous Dollhouse were Scamper and Joni. Scamper's real name was Spunky, and he was a girl. But we cut his hair and put one of Ken's short sleeve cotton leisure blouses on him (in tangerine) and cut the sleeves off, and he began life as Joshua J. Freeman, kingpin. He was my doll.  ALa71's doll was Joni. Joni was also a girl of indeterminate heritage whose name was Hilo, and who wore an orange safety jumper with an H on it and toughskins. We chucked that jumper, cut her hair, made her a boy. We put one of Ken's military ball coats on him with the sleeves cut off, and he became Jonis, kingpin.  Privacy statements signed by the characters prevent me from going into details of precisely what our marathon "games" were about -- which we also took on the road, using a giant metal Winnebago as a home base. But for many years, Scamper and Joni were our alter-egos and our souls. More on them later.

      I'm listening to Journey right now, and that's a good thing. It helps to have adult music playing in my head at any given time: my brain very easily picks up whatever I've listened to and plays it ad infinitum, even when I'm not listening to music during the day. So it's better to have something I like than some little ridiculous thing from  Sesame Street  about broccoli.  Well, let me qualify adult music. Okay, it  is  Journey -- and I belonged to their fan club when I was 11. I say this proudly. In fact, full disclosure and blackmail time, ALa71 and I used to rig a booby trap on my bedroom door and choreograph routines to various Journey songs. In the interest of privacy, I won't disclose which ones or the actual routines, both of which I remember perfectly. What! We were like  eleven . No, really. We weren't twenty five.  Or were we . . .?    Of course, everyone who knew me then knew about my massive crush on Steve Perry. He was my rock man while ALa71's was David Lee Roth and well, I guess if Maidink reads this she would say hers was Randy Rhoads. I used to plot our eventual meeting, courtship and marriage; Steve Perry in my dreams, wearing his white-suit-jacket-and-tails with no shirt/jeans combo from the "Captured" tour.  God, I loved Journey when I was a kid. I can sing it still, but the high notes aren't as pure and held as they were before my lungs had twenty more years on them. When I listen to it now I might as well be up in my dusty childhood bedroom -- we lived in a cape cod and the upstairs walls were slanted in, and I picture myself there sitting leaning against the knotty pine panelling, reading the liner notes over and over for some secret message of affection toward me.  You make me weaaaak . . .and wanna die . . ..    I played my albums on a turntable, and my system had a receiver and speakers! The speakers were sort of rubberized and they were that shade of naugahyde brown so popular in late 70's stereo architecture. God. I adored my 33 LPs. My S says he liked Journey too (he admits this in a moment of weakness, when Soundgarden isn't playing) and he'll say something like, "This is a good song" as he did last night when I was down here reading the blogs and he was playing D&D. And I'll say, "That's song two of side one of  Frontiers ." It is sick that I continue to carry this knowledge with me. Even after all these years.  The first album I bought with my own money was Foreigner 4. Do you remember it? The four was like a four on a gray background when a film counts down. First song: . . . I think it was Urgent. Then Juke Box Hero . . .then Waiting for  a Girl Like You. . . or was Urgent song one, side two? Anyway, I know Junior Walker did the sax solo. Someone help me here! I know you all had it.  I don't have that one now, though; I have to get it. The good thing is that they come out with all greatest hits of that stuff.  Yet there was something so sensual and substantial about old albums, the sleeves with the lyrics, the mysteries between those covers, that is lacking from CDs now.  I used to steal my eldest brother's albums. He was never home, and he had a massive collection just ripe for pilferage. I took a Doors album from him and Led Zeppelin's Physical Graffiti and Van Halen's Women and Children First. He had those plastic sleeves over the covers, like they used to have in record stores. I was like ten years old and I'm upstairs listening to "Trampled Under Foot." (Just switched to that album). Me humming under my breath: "Mama, let me pump your gas, mama let me do it all . . ." My mother: "WHAT did you say?"  Led Zeppelin was lost entirely on my parents. They were that little window of sixties generation that barely knew who the Beatles were, that were into Frank Sinatra and cocktail parties and matching twinsets. My dad was a little too old for Vietnam -- he tried to go five times or something, he wanted to be a medic -- but my parents already had kids and they wouldn't let him go. So he did the second best thing, became a cop and donned riot gear for the remainder of the tumultuous sixties.  My mother's opinion of Led Zeppelin (commenting on the drum solo in "Whole Lotta Love"): "It sounds like a derelict hitting a tin can in a subway tunnel."  My dad's opinion of Led Zeppelin (imitating the tune of "Kashmir"): "Dunh. Duhn, nuh, nuh. Nuh, nuh, nuh. Dunh. Dunh, nuh, nuh. Nuh, nuh, nuh.  . . . How is that  music ?"  How can you explain it to them when you're eleven and waiting for Steve Perry to crawl through your window and whisk you away from these philistines? It's just impossible.

      I'm making friends with thunderstorms, but it's taking a while.  God, this morning thunder shot me right out of bed at 6:30. Which is too early for a Sunday. It was the kind that rumbles the ground beneath the rowhouses for a solid minute. It's still going on, and we almost lost the lights a couple of times. You already know it was hotter than the maw of hell here in Philly yesterday, so this is in response to that. Hopefully it breaks the weather -- it doesn't always.  I never minded thunderstorms when I was little. My mother said, "It's the angels bowling" and that was that. I even remember going outside with ALa71 during a hailstorm, with a cookie sheet over my head. (Where were our parents during all these backyard escapades? Ah, the seventies: the decade of benign neglect.) No, it was something that happened later that made me cut thunderstorms a wide berth.  A guy got killed by lightning when I was a freshman in college. In the woods next to campus. Okay, it was at a keg party -- okay, there were a hundred people there (I wasn't one of them). But it was the freakishness of it that made it is so creepy. It was the last day of classes, it was Friday the thirteenth, and he was a senior, with a job lined up and a wedding planned.  I remember I was at home -- my home was only fifteen minutes from school, but I lived on campus full-time. But I worked for my father on weekends at his warehouse, so I always had to go home from Friday to Saturday.  I remember lying there on my rose-print comforter -- I'm sure I was studying, I was seventeen years old so there wasn't much else to do -- and it was one of those storms that were mostly heat-lightning, cloud-to-cloud.  And then, all of a sudden, there was this bolt -- the only actual bolt of the whole storm -- that streaked across the sky from corner to corner and hit something where it landed.  That was the bolt that killed the guy. It hit his best friend, too, but  his  heart happened to be contracting at the moment, so he lived.  Campus was horrible the next day. I went to a really small school in those days -- it's bigger and more corporate now -- and there were only about 500 on us on campus. You knew, or knew of, everyone. This particular guy that died had helped me with the computer in one of the labs once. I was doing a paper on a story called "Sex Education" and the name of the file was "sex." He got it to print, tossed me a grown-up-boy smile, and said, "Nice title."  Anyway, he died, and it was absolutely horrible. And I feared thunderstorms from then on out. Because I knew what they could do.  I used to be really obsessed with the weather -- James Joyce, by the way, also exhibited these tendencies surrounding thunderstorms, and would literally take a train to another part of Europe to avoid having to be in one -- and still check it before I go out in the summer. But not as crazily as I used to. I figure I survived that downed wire encounter, so I will most probably be okay.  One of my dear departed cats, Angel, feared thunderstorms later in her life. I would hear her carrying on in the back room, trying to get the door open. I would go let her out, and she'd either get in bed with me, or we'd both sit in the hall in the middle of the night, looking at each other with wide eyes and getting whatever comfort you can from sitting on an interior wall.  I'm not joking -- I know I'm a nut case, but the storms in Philly are intense. My old boss who lived in South Africa said she never saw anything as bad as a Philadelphia thunderstorm. I'm sure those of you that live in tornado prone areas would say differently, as we only get those occasionally, but my phobia would never permit me to live where you do. We got one a few years back -- and though the tornado was a couple miles away, I looked out the window and saw a bottle flying down the street at about fifty miles an hour, straight up and down, as if it were on some kind of speeding tabletop.  I'm glad I'm hunkered in the basement of the rowhouse, in the middle of a row, when all this is going on. Now that Angel is gone, I don't have anyone to hide under the bed with me.
