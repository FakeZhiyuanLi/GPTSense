SWEEEEEEEET!!!  today the indian that sells fireworks from the movie Joe Dirt called the office...not too interesting, but kinda neat.  tomorrow I get a tour of the nation from a clan mother...who knew i would ever utter those words...weird!!

      today president reagan died. now i'm listening to some song written about him called "i remember ronald reagan." a tear almost formed in my eye even though the song sounds like it's being sung by Trey from south park. "i remember and i will pass it on, i will bear the torch of freedom, i will raise it and be strong."  on a lighter note, i'm going out tonight (or at least i think i am)...which means that i'm not an entirely huge loser. but i can't quite find something to wear...

      today at work they got their first taste of just how chatty i can be...i think i distracted a few of my coworkers from their tasks today by entertaining them with memories about jelly and pinwheel shoes, guess jeans, and skidz...this was all sparked because someone made reference to how cool eddie bauer once was (back when flannel shirts were popular and corinne had a shrine to kurt cobain)  and since my life is boring, and none of my friends EVER want to go out, i'm staying in tonight to watch "Cats and Dogs" with my mother...wow, give me some tapered leg pants and a floral turtleneck...cause i'm getting the middle-aged woman of the year award!!  one last thing on how stupid americans truly are: my main englishman g-spot gave a tour of the capital and told his followers that george washington was buried at his home, in VERMONT!! now i'm no genius (well actually i am) but didn't we learn about mt. VERNON in elementary school?? these people on the tour didn't even question vermont. next thing you know people are going to think new york state is just the city (oh wait, they already do)  back to being boring...

      frank just told me bob saget is coming to brockport's orientation...i just have to say "HOW RUDE!" since i didn't go to my orientation (stacey and I hid in our rooms) i'm quite jealous although i suppose i shouldn't waste another second on being jealous of people going to see bob saget...honestly, who gets jealous over that!? i guess america's funniest home videos wasn't as lucrative as he thought?! suny brockport and bob saget...a perfect marriage of boring and outdated.

      so i had my interview at a gas station today...i know, i know...a bachelor's degree and i'm doing internships and interviewing at gas stations!!! like i told my friends, if i start referring to walmart as "the mall" or start talking adoringly about someone named junior, bubba, or ernie, feel free to call me the white trash princess of central new york (but i think i should have had a few kids by now to own that title)   i've figured out that my life is very boring...my week being spent looking forward to the drive back and forth from work (where i spend my ever-fleeting "me" moments singing out loud to classic rock hits that only a few of my friends can enjoy).  my friend frank just told me he shaved his head...don't wear any turtlenecks...you'll look like a busted condom!! well i suppose i'll talk to him now (by the way, i realize that i miss having a little brother type around...no one around here to boss around!!)
