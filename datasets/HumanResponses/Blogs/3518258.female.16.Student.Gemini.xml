      Juggalette Feeling  Do You Know How It Feels To Bump The Wicked Shit? It Gives Me This Feeling I Can't Explain!  I Don't Care What You Think A Bit! I Just Love To Listen To The Insane!  If You Talk Shit You'll Get Your Fuckin Neack Split! First The Blood Then The Pain!  ~ME!!!  The Way I Feel  I dedicate this to David!  We haven't been together very long, but my feelings for you are startin to get strong. Im glad that we're together, even if it won't last forever. Im happy that we can clown around, when im with you I never frown. I hope for awhile we don't part, because when we do it'll break my heart!  ~ME!!!  Killa Bitch  Im not what you think i am in my mind im not all good everyone thinks they know me but im just misunderstood!  When they think of me they think im a snitch and they think of me as a lil dirty scared bitch!  But i could be one of those people who can snap ad go coo-coo i could be a person that would just come in and shoot you!  So the next time you call me a name tryin to put me to shame think about your death and weather or not i was to blame!  ~ME!!!  When I Think Of You another to david!  When i think of you, my world is no longer blue.  when i think of you,  i wonder were you are but i know you'll stay true.  when i think of you, i think of all the things we do.  when i think of you, i wonder if you're thinking of me too.  ~ME!!!  My Future Dream to david  Can you  picture the future, us with kids and a house of our own, nights of romance, love, and passion, and nights of kids screaming and crying, nights alone with the family watchin tv, and nights just the two, when i picture the future, all i can see isthe greatest life with you!  ~ME!!!  My Lost Love this one is about my dog Fido {November 7, 2001-July 5, 2003}  Fido were are you? the day you left was the worst! i cried i still cry! i reminise missin you! wishin you were here! in my heart is were you'll always be! i know you'll never escape that! you can never be replaced! you are my baby! the first of mine and the best dog! when i think of you tears come to my eyes! i still have all your toys and your collar! your picture is in a frame on my shelf! i sit at night and think if only i was there for you more you might still be here! you'll forever be my lost love!  ~ME!!!

      this is another poem i wrote and i dedicated to dalton! i feel so bad about what i did!  My love for you is still here you running away is my only fear. I know what i did was wrong thats why your love for me isn't so strong. It tears me up that we aren't together I wish we still were and ill wish it forever.  You got your girl to hold your hand and holding mine is another man. We say we're happy we say we're fine but in our hearts and in our minds we want eachother more but i did wrong and left your heart sore.  This feeling i feel is giving me a fear that only leaves a tear. You see without you im incomplete only for you my heart will beat. My choices i made and the roads i took when we lost it all just made my life fall.  I want you more then ever please come back and stay forever!

      This is one of my poems i dedicate to my homie Ninja D:  You know you my homie, Cuz you're the only one that truly knows me.  You'll stick up for me at the drop of a hat, Cuz you know i forever got your back.  If anyone ever disrespects me, You're there when i need.  If i need you or you need me we're always there, Cuz for eachother we truly care.  In the words of Shaggz: "be down with me and i'll be down back!"
