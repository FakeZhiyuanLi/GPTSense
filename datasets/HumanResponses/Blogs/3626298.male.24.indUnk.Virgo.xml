      Holy Shit. I just spent I don't know how many hours over the weekend constructing a brand new web site from scratch. Now I see why people charge so much for web design. That shit takes forever. It's not too fancy, but it's a giant's step up from my previous half-assery. I also added a ton of my older art, a 'links' page, and an 'about me' page. I'll be adding still more art sometime soon.  I attended orientation at UCF Saturday, and it served as an infuriating reminder of everything I don't like about school. I spent thirty-five dollars and seven hours in the company of idiots to have my time wasted on something I could have done by myself in one hour. Not only that, but a class I neglected to take while I was a Valencia was a pre-requisite for nearly every class I need for my major. Krablesbrat.

      Something I did with a blunt sharpie at work. I'm not totally happy with it. I think it could have turned out better, so I tried to clean up some of the rougher lines in Photoshop. It seems to be some sort of  urlLink deer/reptile creature .

      The maintenance men from my apartment complex are outside my bedroom window, making ungodly noises. It sounds as if they're trying to wipe my air conditioner from the face of this Earth. There's popping and grinding sounds, shit smashing to pieces, men cursing, shrubbery being leveled, and chains clinking betwixt the squeeling tires of a truck and whatever unholy mechanism it's trying to wrench from the safety of its perch. I'm too scared to go out there. And may God have mercy on that poor, wretched condensor.

      I’ve never been much into pinball, but lately my interest in the sport has been growing. I’ve been wasting a lot of hours at work with the space pinball game on the computer, and last night at the bar I took the plunge and dropped a couple of bucks on the Ripley’s Believe It Or Not and Lord Of The Rings machines. I wish they still had the uncensored Playboy pinball game, I hear nothing but good things about it. Mostly the boobies.  I put up a  urlLink new drawing  I did last night. I really like it. Piratusco liked it too, I told him he can use it for whatever he sees fit. I want to orchestrate a major overhaul of my site sometime soon; I feel a powerful itch beginning. Here’s some photobooth action from last night’s Will’s Pub drunkelry. Jaret was laughing too hard to stay in the first shot, the pussy.    It feels like christmas in there!

      My air conditioner has been broken since yesterday and won't be fixed until tomorrow. They had to order a new condenser. I’d like to condense my fist and their face. In the meantime it’s eighty-five degrees in here. Thankfully I have an overhead fan.  At least I have a hundred entertaining Gameboy Advance roms on my computer to keep my mind off the heatstroke.

      It's been a week since my last libation, and given my penchant for romanticizing alcohol dependance, the realization is a stark one. A shocking blow to my desire fulfillment, damn ye operation! I'm not the heaviest drinker, but I try to assault my liver a good three to four times a week. I'm trying to decide, at this moment, whether the payoff for getting liquored up at 1:00pm on a Monday afternoon is worth the risks involved, and I'm predictably leaning toward drinking. A week is a long time to spend in sober pain. I've also got quite a few hours alone to kill until I return to work on Wednesday, so I think my decision is made.  I just finished the biography Morrissey & Marr: The Severed Alliance, by Johnny Rogan. I now officially know more about Steven Patrick Morrissey than any man should have an inclination to know. The book begins by going fairly in depth about Morrissey's  grandfather . I'm find it hard to ascribe relevance to such an approach, but, whatever. I just started re-reading John Gardner's Grendel, I forgot how incredibly affecting it is.

      My new viewing obsession is  urlLink The Dresdon Dolls  video for  urlLink Girl Anachronism , it has supplanted (The GayPimp)  urlLink Johnny McGovern 's  urlLink Soccer Practice  as my favorite thing to watch every damn day. Girl Anachronism makes me want to dance like a natural disaster. The band's a  urlLink Mates Of State  style line-up with a girl on keyboard and vocals and her boyfriend on drums. I listened to some of their other songs and enjoyed their down-tempo stuff as well, I'm going to have to pick up the "A Is For Accident" album.  I borrowed the Live At The Phoenix Greyhound Park DVD of comedian  urlLink Neil Hamburger  from Talcott and watched the hell out of it. Shit, that guy is one of the funniest funnymen I've ever seen. His whole bit is telling embarrassingly bad jokes, and then feeling sorry for himself. It's the most amazing thing I've ever seen. He's got the image down pat, too. I wish I had known about him when he came through town a few months back.

      My debilitating infirmity has cost me the attendence of two anticipated concerts. Two out of a projected three shows that I have looked forward to attending these past few months. So I guess I've missed my quota.  urlLink Bonnie "Prince" Billy  was on Monday. I heard the in-store performance at Park Ave CDs was farcical so I'm glad I didn't get to witness that.  urlLink Duvall  played last night, which is a reincarnation of  urlLink The Smoking Popes . I had a free ticket to ride but I just couldn't muster the strength to transport myself there. At least there's still  urlLink Iron & Wine  in July.  I need to lie down now.

      Monday I had excruciating surgery performed on me, twice. I found myself under the influence of a fearful amount of pain, and almost as much Percocet. Laying around at home after the initial operation, what had begun as acceptable bleeding gradually became disconcerting hemorrhaging. Several hours and two rolls of paper towels later a fit of comically bloody light-headedness prompted me to contact the clinic. Another call to Jaret who dropped me off and they gruelingly cauterized and sutured some more. The second go at it was a little more successful, so thankfully I didn't bleed to death overnight.  Not a fun way to start the week, but today I'm feeling much better. I'll be laying about the apartment, enfeebled for the next few days, gradually cleaning up the sanguine mess I've made.

      We finished shooting for my new movie project, "The Last Days Of Whorebot" on Friday, then on Saturday edited most of it together. I figure if we all get together on Thursday we can do the overdubbing and knock it out. It's looking to be about 3x as retarded as The Fag, my first short.  The Whorebot crew consists of me, Steve Raabe, Jeremy Talcott, and Jess Miles. I think I can safely say this is something we'll all be happily ashamed of making.

      I am attempting to set up a Blog for my website to disperse mostly factual information about myself. News about projects I'm working on or whatever I'm interested in at the moment.  Bwa!

      My friend Aliza convinced me to enter a T-Shirt/Sticker design contest held by Park Ave CDs. I came up with a couple of last minute submissions, viewable  urlLink here . I damn sure could use $75 worth of store credit right now.

      I got so excited reading about the new GTA: San Andreas that I finally broke down and bought a used copy of Vice City. If GTA3 was any indicator, I'm not going to be getting anything else done for the next two months. I'll be fully immersed in my maudlin urban bubble of mind-warping ultra-violence. I expect to look like a mole man when I emerge from my hovel, bulging pale eyes blinded by the sun, hissing at stray cats. So, not too far from the norm, really.

      Put up a  urlLink new drawing . Will's Pub has an 'art board' with pens and blank stickers lying about, so I've been having fun with that lately.

      We're completely done with "The Last Days Of Whorebot." I'm completely excited, it makes the laughter pour forth in great abundance. I can't wait to start showing it to people, and as soon as I can figure out how to compress the .mov file to something I can put on my website, I'll make it happen. Until then, I'll be holding private audiences for anyone interested enough.
