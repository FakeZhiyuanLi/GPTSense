      I figured out the whole picture thing. Now to re-size them so you can actually see something. Oh, I will become computer literate if it kills me! now to figure picasa out so that my pics actually show. It might help if I read it but I want to be able to just *flash* have it done! I don't want to take time to learn it. Yes I am the queen of instant results/gratification. HiYah!   yes I know this was posted after the pics posted, but I didn't know the pics posted.  Again claiming ignorance!

      No voice still!  Coughing is giving me abs of steel but my back is not as happy... just strained.  So, the nightlife for me has died down this last week and coming week.  I have to get better by this weekend.  Well, if I had anything interesting to say, I'd write more but for now, I'll leave you with this: ---------

      Still coughing, still sounding like a donkey but magic last night!  Claritin and Robitussin.  And then like someone put a pillow over my face, the coughing stopped and I passed out.  I actually sle[t from 0830 to 1230.  Amazing!  woke up nastily groggy to the door bell, where people were bringing me gifts and wishing me better.  All because I missed church, and they cared.  Which is such a great feeling.  Sadly, this has got to be gone soon. Dan's family is flying in from Colorado and staying with us friday through monday and I have to sing at Church on Sunday "God Bless America/America the Beautiful"  Which has a terribly soprano super-high ending note.  Sure!  No more bars or late nights for me.  Tomorrow is home cleaning day and sleeping day.    So T, if you want to be domestic with me today, rather than fun at the zoo, I'd be glad to come get you.  and the living dead signs off!

      You know... orange flavored drink that comes in a powdered form.  Yep, feels so good going down the 'ole sore throat.  Never mind that I sound like Kathleen Turner which is an improvement from the Donkey girl voice that I have been sporting!  It was donkey girl sings our favorite Karaoke hits last night...a little Macy Gray:I try, a little Bangles:Hazy Shade of Winter, and something which slips my mind at the moment... thought that Jameson, Jagermeister and Vodka-cran would help the sicky and to an extent it did.  I slept for 4 hours straight with no coughing but otherwise it did nothing to improve the quality of my voice.  Surprise Surprise!  So! out tonight and up at the crack of dawn so I can drive down to Roseburg and then Winston to hit a wedding for the day.  Should be interesting, it's outdoors and the forecast calls for rain.  A long 4 hour drive, outdoor rainy wedding does nothing for my desire to wear a dress at this formal occasion, so we will have to see what I come up with.  What a pain!   Alright, ill Taryn says good day for the weekend.  Have a better one than she!

      Still sick, barely working, barely breathing and looking not so hot today.  But the work on my desk is piling up so I must be here for a while at least.  On my way to work the radio was playing and every song that played reminded be of someone or period of my life... Kinda of weird,  There was "The Church; Milky way" where every song by "The Church" reminds me of poor him, sad and depressed and constantly telling me that I was going to push him back into depression(but I liked the days we escaped).  Tori Amos/Bjork that time of my life was fun, no responsibilities or reality-just make believe and learning...fun, fun, fun.  And next was Primus and Candlebox, and that guy was my definition of infatuation, totally wrong for me but terribly romantic.  And then they played cranberries that was a time in my life that was kind of mixed up: i hurt a couple people including myself but was always honest with them.  Insane in the Membrane next: 4 years of my life taken with one kid whom I should have dumped after the 1st year but it was too comfortable and he was always around and we are still friends but it just should have been different.  So as far as I can tell the radio played all the boys I liked at one time or another.  Now, I'm going on 5 years of marriage with a man who daily surprises me.  I like(and love) him so much more now than I did when we dated.  I love to hang out with him and every day it is nice to come home to him. The music playing that reminds me of him... Foo Fighters, Big Head Todd and the Monsters, Train, The Darkness, and so much more.  He's a mixed tape...laid back with a little metal, a little jazz, a little Beastie Boys, a little Neil Diamond, a little punk, and sometimes shocks me with Prince.    It seems a little weird that I have a song or type of music that reminds me of/or encompasses everyone I know.  But that is just part of what makes me tick, a little song, and little singing, a little music pulling emotion and memories.  But just as I love the songs, I love you too...

      It has been 6 days since I had a voice that did not resemble the sweet sounds of a donkey.  And although I start out pretty good in the morning (be it 4am when my coughing fits start up or 1030am when I just can't fall back asleep) by noon, I'm worn completely out!  Breathing sucks, coughing sucks, and sore throat and ears suck.  What nasty bug got me?  the evil bug from hell itself!  So, a couple of hours at work today to get all these people squared away and then home to bed.  And maybe I might venture out tonight.  But I doubt it.  Sleeping sounds too wonderful right now.  So far, I have not been missed... lets see if we can continue that line of thinking.

      to pick a few books for summer reading.  5am on the eliptical cross-trainer with a good book the whole summer should greatly improve my feeling of non-accomplishment, laziness and the lot.  Okay, friday... 5pm come quickly!  I think tonight I will go out and then not again until wed.  I've got to get something done this weekend.  The rest of the home cleaned and crap put away.  And get the cats accustomed to the place.  Igor and Froederick take turns freaking me out in their little black cat ways.  Staring at ceiling all crouched down on their haunches acting like something is going to come tearing down through the ceiling and rip us to shreds.  I think we need to invest in some kitty zoloft, which I could probably use too!   okay see ya.  Have a great weekend!

      ha ha HA! why do I even respond sometimes?  I'll re-read what I wrote and sure enough, not like it, and *pop* it's gone.  Most replies are just my way of letting you know that you were in my thougths...so I read your stuff and this is my way of letting you know.  Everybody needs thought about now and then...  And don't be dumb!  It is always a platonic thought!

      Kinda nostalgia day... got lots on the mind.  Shut my office door and play a little music and get my nose to the grind stone and these papers off my desk and projects outta here.  I think my office is due for a facelift.  I see $$$ flying out of my pockets already.  I'm also due for a day trip to seattle to get lost downtown, and then hit IKEA on the way home.  Maybe I'll get the Huz to call in sick.  New home, boring office... a veritable cornucopia of blank canvases to be painted.  I'm in a gold kind of mood...   music in the background: "anyone will do/could be you/ whoever you are I've got my light on/wherever you can I'll be there I swear/ let it be me / let me be your love"

      Dreams where I am an exhibitionist make me a little nervous. What really is hiding deep inside. Oh well, supress and ignore!   So, will I see you all tonight? This is a great day, my headache has left after much work at the chiropractor. Who told me I was strange, and that it looked as though I had been hit by a car. Which after he was done putting 7 vertebrae back where they were supposed to be, felt like I had been hit by a car. And I still had a headache and cramps to boot. Lucky for me my body goes into this pain diversion reaction where when my body is terribly messed up I only get a nasty headache. Sometimes a migraine which I guess is good to because the migraine shuts me down completely.   Okay as interesting as this is, it is more p.i. than I'm sure you care to know. Well, hope to see you tonight. Let's see what ridiculous song I can mess up tonight!  Current Mood:  chipper

      And it proves no intention of mine to make words stick together in a form or story that you might want to read.  And moreover, much fun and driving and celebrating with old friends was loads of fun for me, but maybe not to the reader.  So, I will spare you the details of my long weekend.  And wait until something more interesting happens by in my head that I feel is worth sharing.  Have a good tuesday.

      Just a thought as he talked to me, and didn't seem to notice I had a face.  So, the new dress kicks ass.  Who knew?!?!   Okay 3 rooms down, and only 8 to go.  The new home is coming along, I should invest in clorox this year.  Other people's homes have that wierd smell, you know "their" smell.  And sometimes it is that familiar, "oh this home smells like the smith's home" and is nice and nostalgic and then others like my current, have that weird funk of a smell.  Like they used something to cover the funk but the funk just alters the supposedly better smelling stuff.  Yes, this is my battle in the next two weeks.  I want my house to smell like good food, baked goods, warm and inviting and comfortable.  Not like "I own a gazillion cats,and my husband does metal working in the basement, and I have four teenage-boys on the football team, and I make my own perfumes in the kitchen" kind-of smell.  yes, I guess the house was well lived in.  Back to work today and busy all weekend so I guess not much will get done until monday.  Hope all are more productive than I this weekend, at least have a little fun in my name please.

      pale skin, long red hair, and an absent look in the characters he painted.  Not very absent though, (deleted, so that I might not incriminate myself and alienate others!)  okay off my soap box and boring part of life.  I guess it is nice to be crushed upon... marriage has definitely shielded me from even thinking someone might want me.  Except those silly drunks at the bar.  Stevenson! that still cracks me up.  Nina will know.

      Out tonight to make mischief!  Make snide thoughts about scantily clad females throwing themselves at sailors, or at eachother, or just making fun of whoever I feel like.  That's what the Rose festival is for.  Then to a few places to see what trouble I can find, and then tomorrow to Cannon Beach for sandcastles and stuff.  Love the life I lead, this week and last.  Buhbye.

      Skunks in my kitty kennel @ 2:45a.m.. Gotta love that!  so I put some pants on, stand out there talking to it, trying to figure out how it got in there in the first place, and it turns...flips up it's tail...stops hims little feet at me... and then races out of the kennel squeezing between the diamond fencing.  What!?!  I wouldn't believe it if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes.  Which helped me understand how it got in there and rest assured that my fat boys would not be able to do the same, as Froederick probably weighs close to 18lbs and Igor probably 14lbs.  But boy were they distressed that that little skunk ate their food they kept howling at me the rest of the night.  And it figures because I went to bed at 1:30 awaken by said crashing skunk at 2:45 and fell back asleep around 4am, and up at 6am.  I think I'll take the rest of the day off work and bum around town.  Guiness, butter baby shots, and Electric Razberry Lemonade were good friends last night.  hhhmmmmm!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      What! oh nope, things are a little discombobulated.  Keep waking up late when I go to bed early.  Wake up early when I go to bed late.  And the roosters keep crowing and my kitties are crying and there just doesn't seem to be any thing right side up today.  But five more days, and all will be right.  I move into my new home and get to sleep in my own bed and use my very own bathroom, bath tub and shower!  Hooray! And It's wednesday, I'm supposed to meet friends at the boiler room for some more crazy singing, can't wait till they get more CDs, come on! How much Pat Benatar and Evanescence can one do.  I should scream and rip heads off if one more person asks me to sing "Bring Me To Life" ---"oh, but it is YOUR song and you do it well"  Whiny boring song! Death to "Bring Me To Life"!!!  I should have stuck with a fake name, now that strangers know my name it is getting a little less interesting.  I could have been "Ivy" forever.  Okay, It's time to get back to work, or actually start working today.  Did I tell you that I should be fired, because I really should.

      Perfect mix of family and friends this weekend.  Things done on my own time that made for such a pleasant time.  I spent gobs of money on things I don't need, like glittery fairy eye makeup and tangerine shirts and ohhhhhhh to be careless and reckless and fun.  I went out everynight, and played with a new friend who slays me!  I laughed so much I feel like I've done thousands of sit-ups my stomach is so sore.  We saw Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind last night and she forgot to tell me that the end would make water come out of my eyes.  Jerk!!!  But what a lovely story!  I'm still in a good mood.  And then over to the boiler room to watch stand-up comics and then over to Dante's for Karaoke from Hell, which Tiffany did an amazing rendition of Rebel Yell.  OOOOHHHHH to have a low voice, no karaoke from me lastnight...saving those poor unfortunate souls from timid/Why are you staring at me!/please don't boo me/shaking knee/ frump feeling--- performance.  Let the lovelier ones shine tonight!  Okay, tuesday at work now!  Loving you all!

      my head still hurts, my hair needs washed and styled because I'm bored with it!  The whole long thing goldy auburn thing is nice but I have to see it every day and it's natural and naturally boring me.  Mostly because I'm too lazy to get up early to do it, just like make-up.  Especially if I have gotten up early to exercise.  It's sooo much work being beautiful!  The expectations! and then there was this one guy who told me I look much better when i don't put any effort into it.  ummm...yeah!  a natural beauty eh?  I always feel messy.   sorry being a major girl today! okay. luvyabuhbye!

      In a great mood although I just had a ridiculous trip to work, dropped the car off for repairs (to the tune of $2400-ouch!) and the rental car wasn't already set-up!&nbsp; Hello!&nbsp; I do have to go to work!&nbsp; and then it took for ever to get that straightened out.&nbsp; Idiots!&nbsp; And a terrible headache on the verge of migraine, construction on the way to work and some wierdo in the car next to me, winking at me and waving.&nbsp; yeah! like I'm gonna roll down the window and chat.&nbsp; NO! But, a "rockstar" later and I'm chipper and hyper and getting tons of work done.&nbsp; Yippeeeeeee!!!&nbsp; Last night I sang: Lisa Loeb: Do you sleep, Melissa Ethridge: I'm the only one, Duet with a stranger that asked; Shania Twain: from this moment and surprize surptize I didn't know that song and faked it alright but really!&nbsp; Do I look like the type to listen to Country? and then I sang Veruca Salt: Seether.&nbsp; That song rocks.&nbsp; I sang something else first but can't remember what it was.&nbsp; and I'm very sure the headache is from the "Black Opal" that Nikki made.&nbsp; Just the thought of it hurts my head but it was tasty!&nbsp;&nbsp;  Ryan- What song did I sing first?&nbsp; it's gonna make me nutz! So, hope all y'alls day is happy/hyper as mine.

      across town there are three buildings with diamond shaped tops, I see them from my office window.&nbsp; In the last two weeks the sun has been at the perfect spot in the sky to catch the angle that reflects it's lights off of the windows at the top, and shoot flooding orange light into my office.&nbsp; It is beautiful, it makes my mirrored reflection glow as in flame.&nbsp; It heats up my office and gives me chills and is just a feeling that makes me think "wow".  Things are just beautiful.&nbsp; The wind blowing through leaves, or tall dry grasses making a noise that crescendos as if something great is about to happen.&nbsp; The clouds building up, billowing tall plumes into the sky and making sunset colors more divine than I've ever noticed before.&nbsp; People being so busy and so friendly lately that I notice how small and insignificant I've become in the scheme of things.&nbsp; I haven't been as friendly in the last few years, i've turned into somewhat of snob.&nbsp; Mostly because I don't have anything important to say, nor would I want to come off sounding ignorant... and that fear has kept me from being friendly.&nbsp; I've got to hand it to my new friend T, she has opened a few windows and turned a strange mirror on me.&nbsp; And I'm starting to like the way&nbsp;my eyes are opening and I am seeing&nbsp;myself a little&nbsp;more clearly.&nbsp; What a strange time in life.&nbsp; There is so much change happening and some of the changes are wanted and some not so much.&nbsp; But I'm stretching and finding lots of things I quite enjoy.  Thanks Tiffany.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      I hate radio ads.&nbsp; My dad got a job. I have giant hair today.&nbsp; And I'm at work.  That's my day so far and I'm craving chocolate, dark chocolate, hot chocolate with whip cream.&nbsp; I guess m&ms might cover it.&nbsp; I'll have to see what I can do.&nbsp;  Okay, its almost 0900 and I'm already bored.&nbsp; It's BR tonight even though at the moment I am not in the mood.&nbsp; I still want to go running, maybe dancing, maybe just roaming around town, fast.  good day.

      temperature has gone down a little, yesterday was productive (cleaned house, did laundry, bought Neverending story and Lost boys DVD and watched those, went out to dinner w/the Huz, picked up my aunt from the mechanics, got all the laundry put away and I even had time to shower and sleep) . And yep!&nbsp; I'm here sitting at work wondering why the hell I haven't found a new job.&nbsp; I sat in traffic for an hour and&nbsp;a half this morning and that can kill any job's delight.&nbsp; Like I don't waste enough time of my own, I mean really!!! Okay, looking forward to this next 3 weeks to get over with and turn my motivation into something great.&nbsp;   I'm stuck in Fitzgerald land and would love to take off a couple months and live like one of his characters but that will be a while.&nbsp; But we are planning a nice little vacation down to Cali to hit all and I mean all!) of the Amusement parks around Halloween and then drive back up the coast and hit the Hearst Castle for one of the evening tours, where the employees are all dressed up like the actors and are partying and portraying the life that was led then.&nbsp; Which just goes right along with my F. Scott Fitzgerald wanting.&nbsp;   okay have a nice day.

      so the bands we went to hear last night were amusing if nothing else.&nbsp; luckily we only stayed for the first two because as much as we all love masochistic/torturing/screaming heavy"so-called" rock, after the first two bands who managed to do short sets that supposedly were angry, loud songs, I still can't seem to remember if there was actually any lyrics whatsoever.&nbsp; The last band was Kettle Cadaver, the guy we knew was in Contusion and it was their first gig ever.&nbsp; Which they at least were more tight musically but again minimal talent.&nbsp; the first group unfortunately seemed to have a 21 yr old fat disgusting lead singer who thought he was talented and good looking and something of a sex god.&nbsp; He was repulsive his fat hairless stomach had motion all its own and he liked to jump around the stage which made this all the more rebarbative.&nbsp; And then I can do GWAR on occasion but Kettle Cadaver, hammering nails through their scrotums, and using staple guns on themselves everywhere, attaching barbed wire to their faces and limbs and screaming/yelling/shrieking to unorganized sound on familiar instruments only goes so far with me.&nbsp; I'm bored, the spectacle holds no intrigue to me at all.&nbsp; And all aside, the crowd at these types of shows are relatively creepy.&nbsp; But, we stayed until 1130pm and then went to BR to observe another kind of spectacle.&nbsp; What is wrong with people?!?!&nbsp; It was just T, Jason and I and poor Jason having to spend the whole evening with such hot chicks was having a weird night.&nbsp; And the girl watching for him seemed strained as he kept apologizing and explaining that he's jus' torny.&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean can you blame him? One voluptuous vixen and one curvy kitten at your side the whole night, what can you do? Yeah to say the very least, the night was amusing but boring.&nbsp; Girls are dumb and guys can be ridiculously stoopid!&nbsp; Not our present company just all those weirdos we were watching.&nbsp; Hopefully this weekend can prove better for society.&nbsp; Because I'm starting to think that avoiding all&nbsp;these scenes and sticking to home and "restaurants" sounds like a mighty fine idea.&nbsp; And most likely less expensive. Game night should prove fun, but tonight I'm looking to try a different place (sorry BR).&nbsp;

      i had a strange day yesterday.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I drew lots of attention and none of it bad.&nbsp; One of my friends even told me I looked so hot that she wanted to have sex with me. ROFLMAO!!!!   It's nice to have a day like that.&nbsp; I'm still basking in that "pretty" feeling.&nbsp; It will last until I get outside and start sweating.&nbsp; I'm really wanting to cut my hair off again.&nbsp; It's almost to my waist and in the heat feels like a giant rug draped over me aside from when it's hot and sticky it ends up feeling nasty and heavy and wrapped around my neck in an uncomfortable manner.   So, I'd like to think... that I can feel the way I did yesterday all the time.&nbsp; Except for the fact that it felt like I had a crush on everyone.&nbsp; And of course magnified with alcohol.&nbsp;  Okay enough of that.&nbsp; So, I'm out again tonight with T, to go listen to a couple of bands we've never heard of except she knows one of the guitarists/singer from.&nbsp; So Conans on Hawthorne tonight.&nbsp;&nbsp; Please be interesting!!!&nbsp; I can't stand anymore dull rock.

      So, most of you know I live in the sticks.&nbsp; Have a geat new house with a amazing view of the sunsets!&nbsp; But it is still the sticks and cable TV out there is horribly expensive, so being the bright kids that we are (the huz and I) didn't even think of hooking up our TV to the cable connection in the wall, as we had seen that the previous owners had satellite and took it with them.  Well, we blew about $500 this weekend which included a new tube.&nbsp; You never realize what your missing until you change it.&nbsp; The difference between an 18" and 27" is drastic and the picture quality from the old tube to the new flatscreen is quite noticeable too.&nbsp; And then we had bunny ears on the old TV and decided to hook it into the wall... Presto!&nbsp; They never unhooked their cable (yahoo!).&nbsp; And we haven't left the house since.&nbsp; History channel, American Choppers (totally addicted to this one), watched movies that I haven't seen: Love Actually, Spirited away, etc...  so, i think I'll venture out tonight.&nbsp; Rip myself from the television and talk to people.  To mention something quickly: Guy (i know)&nbsp;in dreams teaching me to fight and me kicking the crap out of tons of people.&nbsp; I am always protecting myself from things in these dreams.&nbsp; I wake up tired and sometimes feeling relieved.&nbsp; but always happy that guy showed me a new trick and glad to see said guy.&nbsp; But always weirded out that I am always fighting and action herionesque.

          It's strange to see your own profile silhouette across the wall.&nbsp; The sun shone onto the mirror in the side of my office casting my profile on the wall northeast of me.&nbsp; Seeing my nose and eyelashes in a way I hadn't before.&nbsp; My jawline and wild hair...  Can't seem to leave the fog I'm in.&nbsp; And it's ok, one of those days when I'd like to escape alone and wander the streets downtown.&nbsp; Find someone to "play" intrigued with.&nbsp; Some way to feel out of body and desire-able.&nbsp; This mental feed that keeps me stone faced and blah can be changed with a little smile, a little eye contact.&nbsp; And the heat doesn't seem to help with this lethargy that has enveloped me.&nbsp; If it rains again today I'm gone.&nbsp; My left hand is numb from an oncoming migraine and I only need one more reason to send me out the doors.&nbsp;  It's a deep blue day, dark eyes...blue shirt...wide stare.&nbsp; A day when actually putting an effort into my looks would have improved my mood.&nbsp;&nbsp; But I stayed in bed too long knowing that if I got up, I was going to be irritated all day.&nbsp; And only music helps on days like this.&nbsp; A driving, pulsing, emotion drawing song that can make me cry or make me wanton or make me thrilled.&nbsp; A day... gray clouds, slight breeze and impending rain call me mysteriously.&nbsp; Just call me ...

      Life running the Peds ICU here at the Children's hospital has turned boring.  Not challenging! so I talked to the County DA and it sounds positive about becoming his secretary and going back to a county job with good pay and benefits and where I get to think for myself and do projects that constantly are changing.  So, cross your fingers for me.  I will be applying for that position in a few weeks and so far I've been told that I'm the only one qualified!  Thank God for strange jobs that have fallen in my lap and the smarts to over-achieve enough to excel out of them!  Don't get me wrong every job I've had has had good benefits and pretty good pay, but I need a challenge and have figured out that I am not really a career person.  My job does not make-up who I am, so I must continue to move on and find one that pays for what does... my life outside of the office (quirky stocking girl with matching shoes and outfit that plays all night long and runs about the city watching people and loving everything!!!).  P.S.  I will be looking at a $5 an hour pay increase too.  that won't hurt at all.

      Blehchct!  So I was awaken numerous times to strong winds, booming thunder and beautiful flashes.  Loved every minute of it and didn't mind being jarred awake like that.  But this morning around 5:30 a woke up to a weird feeling and above my bed was a blurry black object moving strangely about on the ceiling.  You know it's bad when you can see something like that without the glasses (as I am terribly blind without the lenses).  It was the nastiest of gross spiders I had seen in a while so I called in the Huz... since I can't reach the ceiling and had him use my ever trusty tennis racket to kill the beast that was doing some weird dance on my ceiling.  He squished it but it wasn't right... the body, with legs and head came down and started crawling away so we beat the hell out that part and then the back/butt part that must've been making some kind of a web, let itself down with it's web slowly. *shivers*  so we beat the hell out of that part too and I will not be going back into my bedroom without the vacuum now.  It seems that gross spiders are coming from nowhere and are all over the house.  Oh and to make it all better... with my glasses on: the spider was at least the size of a nickel.  Blehchct!

      So, logically I can talk my way out of wanting to have a baby.  I can reason that it will happen when it is supposed to and the timing is wrong right now.  I can do this.  And then there are times like now when I find out that another friend or relative has gotten pregnant against huge obstacles (or quite ridiculously pregnant again).  I just recieved news that Dan's cousin is expecting and she has a pituatary tumor so they thought that she might not be able to  and I'm excited for them and happy for(with)them.  But it reminds me, that I'm not where I thought I'd be by now.  We've been capable for the last 3 years and medically determined that there is nothing wrong with either of us (physically) but we just haven't concieved.  And today the good news makes me cry.  I go for months at a time where I'm completely fine and the desire for this isn't even there but when reminded, there is a strange pain, a want to experience this amazing thing.  It makes a queer anger, a feeling of things not being fair, although that is ridiculous.  I'm not entitled to concieve, nor do I believe that everybody deserves to have children.  But it definitely is painful today.  And it's something that I have no one to talk to about who can relate.  None of my friends or family have experienced this or can adequately sympathize.  So, it will get thrown onto this page (in release).

      I'm exhausted, not really sick anymore, I sleep through my alarm clock, I wake up way late and rush all morning long and get more exhausted.  Plus I had a friend ask me if I was pregnant on wednesday...What is that about?  I must be looking larger and tired, lovely!!!  Oh well, it can only get better... This is friday so have a good weekend.  Thank you and goodnight.

      last blog entry deleted. There are just some socially acceptable things to do and some not. And my over zealous choice of descriptive words made it all the more uncomfortable thinking back on it. It is interesting to me and I would like to know her but it isn't a good idea.  re-cap: work yesterday, migraine yesterday, sleep after work, go out 8pm until 2am get home realize I left all the doors to my house unlocked, freak out and search whole house (every closet, under beds, in cupboards), go to bed, jump out of bed when heard thumps, searched house again, go back to bed, hear noises and motion detector lights come on in the back of the house, jump out of bed look out windows, see nothing, crawl back into bed, intently listening ears perked at greatest magnitude, light goes off and goes back on again, so I jump out of bed, look out window, see nothing but this time all of the flowers in the back of the house trampled, try to wake up the snoring Huz to no avail(tells me to quit it and go to sleep), light goes on and off again, can't see back downstairs door from bedroom window so I get dressed run into dining room making lots of noise and fly out onto deck to look underneath through slats, see nothing check all locks on every door, lock door from basement to rest of house, go back to bed locking even my bedroom door, light goes off once back into bed, then comes back on with noises, so fly out of bed, get dressed again, grab the only weapon I could find(i.e. Tennis racket) and search whole house again:every room, closet, cupboard, check locks on all windows, garage, basement, utility room, basement bathroom and bedroom w/ closet behind doors and storage rooms. And then (weilding my trusty tennis racket) brave the back yard to see just what might be out there, looking wildly around w/heart pounding, run back inside close and lock all locks on screen and door. Still having seen nothing but trampled flowers decide it best to just turn the motion detector off for the night because by this time it is about 4am and I have to be up and out of here by 6am. Lock all doors behind me, basement and bedroom and open windows to hear back yard open curtains, crawl into bed listening intently still, eyes studying every shadow cast on walls and finally fall asleep. 5:45am came too soon. And the day has been nothing but hurried and swamped but I'm functioning. I am an idiot but functioning. It's a good thing the Huz sleeps soundly, as he did the whole way home from town and the whole time I was freaking out. I guess he just knows he married a spaz and has built into his system a spaz alarm silencer in his head. I'd like to hope had it been a real emergency that he would perform but I'm starting to think he might sleep through anything.  Again, I just am a self proclaimed idiot and would have continued that behavior even if I had not seen the trampled flowers and heard thumping. I have cats just so I can blame noises on them and be able to sleep. But cats inside can't set off the motion detector outside. So spaz or not you decide.

      I was listening to the radio out in lala land and i get to Milwaukie and commercials start so then I come back to earth and start looking around me and notice a huge Canadian goose strewn across the rode in many pieces, guh!  And then some bleach blonde,overtanned, fake nail lady in a brand new 4Runner cuts me off and stuck to the back bug deflector or some weird roof rack is a large robin-kind-of bird that had gotten it's foot stuck in the rack and is thrashing around violently in the wind until it died right there in front of me and just hangs for another 10 miles. So, I get up beside the lady to tell her she has a huge dead bird hanging from the back of her car and try my best to get her attention(waving hands at her, honking, stop ping way behind traffic) and she looks at me, puts on her sunglasses, rolls up her window and completely ignores me (on purpose!) so that I can't tell her about it.  And like it wasn't bad enough that I woke up from strange dreams and hour late and felt all strange and sore and freaked out.  Put sloppy work clothes on, no makeup, combed hair and left for work in a daze.  This can not make for a great day.  I think I'll go back home to bed.

      yesterday I felt pretty good and wednesday too, I even sang a little bit. But today, no voice again! And sore too. Dan's fam gets in around 6ish tonight and I felt so exhausted lastnight, I didn't do anything but cook dinner. Steaks and Avocado! YUMMMM!!!!!!!!! and for desert a box full of costco cream puffs (they are from the devil!) I have a bit of housecleaning to do and then be the little hostess with the mostess for the weekend. So, it will be the quick clean when I get home and then we have to meet them for dinner around 730 or 8. I'm soooo tired already! I slept for 10hrs lastnight and was late for work, and it is almost 11am already. Gotta love that!  Okay this is a very boring post!!! maybe updates throughout the weekend.

      So the wedding I went to this last weekend was in Roseburg on saturday at 11am. Well... i went out the night before, got home around 3ish and still needed to shower, do the hair, bring clothes to change into for the formal-outdoor- 90 degree wedding.  And since I was leaving around 530am it didn't make much sense to try and get any sleep in, as it would have made me more tired.  so when I returned home from roseburg around 8pm I decided to go out with the Huz, I had coughed and hacked and wheezed all day but still wanted to go hang out in a smokey bar.  By 1030pm I was miserable, went home to bed continued to cough all night long.  At 9am the Huz went to the store and bought me many drugs to try.  I slept from 930 to noon.  Improvement!  Well, I never slept great the whole week coughing, restless, playing on computer...so what did I do last night? Help a friend move into a new apt, and then went out.  Sang a little with this Kathleen Turner voice and around 130 or 2am thought donuts sounded good.  Got over to Voodoo and decided biscuits and gravy sounded even better so walked up to Roxy with T and Liev and proceeded to talk till 245am then we walked back to the car on NW 3rd and davis and I got home to bed about 4am up at 630/7am for work and here I am.  And I just can't seem to figure out why this cough wont leave and my voice come back.  Curious isn't it!!!  I'm an idiot.  But at least I'm having fun being an idiot!  Thought of stalking somebody lastnight but apathy took over.  So some other day i will come and say hi!  Adios!

      i'm trying to figure out a better way to do the weddings this weekend.  new thought: I just purchased Bjork: Greatest Hits, and Post (Live)...can't believe I didn't have post already, bought the newest Lisa Loeb it doesn't want to play on my computer here at work, but Bjork is playing quite well.  Dumb lisa CD!  And to mention, the bjork is definitely helping the horrible mood I'm in.  And after reading Semaphoria's entry connecting to Lackadasia, yes this is one of my worst faults:  I actually tried to get out of going to Amy's wedding, as I don't feel up to all the catching up with people I know, and the only time I like running into those from my past is when I look stunning...and that is rare and quite positively not going to happen this weekend.  As it is too hot, I'm too tired and the remodeling of the guest house just started.   Maybe I need to go by a new dress for these weddings... that might help.  but I'd rather wear jeans or my nice little black dress.  but neither of those are appropriate for summer evening weddings.  PPLLLLBBBTTTTT!!!!!

      So, my brother left for California Monday morning 630am, he is still not home. He had two tows to small towns the truck broke down 4 times and now is froze up 4 hrs from LA. A trip that should have only taken $120 and 18 hrs has cost him $1150 and taken 3 days and now he is on a plane leaving fresno to go home and then tomorrow come back with a friend and tow the truck home. Aside from the hectic, horribleness of all this, as he is stuck on the side of the road waiting for the 2nd tow, his wife calls and one of their friends (Constance) called Linzee and had just recieved a phone call from 911 trying to locate Constance sister and told her that her sister had made two phone calls to 911 dispatch, she had been abducted and beaten and raped and they couldn't find her. So, Linzee was stuck at home-couldn't go be with her friend-didn't have her husband there with her and was worried about Izak getting home. My poor brother couldn't get a hold of anybody(myself included) for over 3 hours while he was stranded and worried about Linzee and couldn't get home. Finally he got a hold of me and we got the truck towed again but now he was closer to Fresno than LA and had to stay overnight again in a motel. And we were told that Constance's sister was found, but not in good condition. She is in shock and won't speak. These things don't happen to people we know... well, the truck thing does but not the other. And I haven't had that great of a week to begin with. Work sucks, this stupid orientation I have set up is not going smoothly and I feel like all I've done is put out fire after fire. I'm tired! 3 more days to go. and then no plans until october. Somebody tell me something nice (good news, not compliments). I need it!

      I woke up in a horrible mood.  And have got myself all mad and worked up over something that hasn't happened yet and might not.  But I can feel a fight a-comin'!   ...hormones right? being a girl right?                               not feeling like a priority right now

      It took me getting up 4 times to turn the air conditioning on and go sleep out in the living room.  Of course I had to be up at 4:45am to be at work by 6am.  And the brother and wife came over and watched movies until 1130pm so I'm a happy camper this morning.  They both got on their way this morning at 530am and now we wont see them again until christmas.  But at least we get to see them then.  It was loads o fun this weekend.  We had a family reunion and played games and then yesterday we went up the clackamas river past Bagby to Pegleg Falls.  That was great! and had another family dinner of corned beef and cabbage (my first time eating those, kinda good/kinda cabbage).  I ate so much, and when it came time to put on shorts and swimsuit yesterday, it took all my strength to not cry because nothing fit comfortably. (i hate being a girl sometimes!)  So, this week is orientation...I have to spread out a 36 hour work week over a 47 hour orientation schedule.  How to do that without working for free is the question, since i'm not allowed any OT.  Ridiculous!!!  Okay, 'nuff boring stuff i'll write later if something interesting happens.

      Of course God does my hair much better than I, and once the rain comes the curls arrive and shine!  Singing was fun lastnight.  I made my brother sing "Cry little sister" from Lost Boys which ended up being a little high for his range but it was fun.  I'm stuck in a rut with "cool songs" (i.e. Seether, Here and Now, and lastnight's hit 'Harden my Heart~Quarterflash rocks!).  But what can you do when you have a sop voice that isn't really that edgy?  I do what I can.  Okay, the brother got a migraine last night so I'm waiting for mine.  say a little prayer that it never comes!  I don't need that today!  ok-buh-bye-lalas!

      I got home from work last night at about 7:30 and the Huz did not pick up the house like he said he was going to so instead of getting upset and asking him what he's been doing for the last 3 hours (which I knew he was watching TV, potato-ing on the couch) I told him that the sky was weird and we should go for a walk.  It turned out to be a long walk and the weird sky gave to buckets of rain which beat us home (pics to come)  and nonetheless drenched us which has left me with a huge smile and big 'ol hair.    It was wonderful!  Well, I'm at work for a few hours and then I go pick up the brother and wife.  Hooray!  Of course they want to go to the BR with us tonight and that sounds like just the thing for a day like today.  entries might get sporadic this weekend so catch me next week!  Have a beautiful weekend!

      Previously I mentioned that I was invited to two wedding this summer and that they fell on the same day, at the same time. So, Dan and I were going to split up and cover the weddings separately. Well, I kind of forgot to RSVP to my friends Amy and Joel, and I was supposed to by July 14th, so day before yesterday I e-mailed them the RSVP just hoping that they would tell me that they didn't have any room, but they did. Does that make me a jerk or what? I can't believe myself, I really want to see them and all my friends from Canada... But the wedding thing without the Huz is just not as fun. And it also means that I won't get to stay as long because I will have to make the reception for the other wedding because Dan's bestfriends will be at that wedding and have made plans with us for that evening. Guh!  Brother gets in to town tomorrow and we have major plans for running around all weekend and I have to make gobs of delicious, fatty, cheeeezzzyyy, foods and casseroles this weekend as we are invited to a couple barbecues also. I'm already worn out. And we will hear if Dan got the new job by Friday. Which also means I will find out if I will be sleeping alone for the next year because it will be a night shift position. Weird, five years sharing a bed... I am not going to like that part of it!

       crackin up!  I came across an old tape of my brother's.  It had ABC, Criss-Cross, Kid Sensation and Miami bass Machine on it!  Talk about nostalgia, and scary thing is I knew all the words to Iesha, Smurf Rock, Rollin w' #1, and make the bottom drop!.  Oh there is nothing finer than late 80's early 90's rap, especially done by 9 year olds.      And then the drive this morning, Cake playing on the radio; the distance and all of a sudden I look down at the speedometer and I am going 70mph on mcloughlin.  Probably not a good idea!   Yes I'm retarded, this week is slow and thank goodness!  Because my brother and wife are comng into town and i'm sure will speed up to Mach speed by this weekend.  okay.  Have a nice day.

      Yes friday was stupid.  My car ended up costing a little more than originally quoted, my home owners insurance agent called and told me that if we didn't give them $600 by the 5th they would cancel our policy so I had to go to a bank branch and find out why it hadn't been paid, and of course when I got there the only person available to help me was brand new and had no idea what she was doing.  By the time that she had 2 people come over to help her we determined that they had to call headquarters and find out what was wrong, whom then put us on hold for 20 minutes.  Then in the end of that call determinined that it was supposed to be paid at closing (which we paid!!!) and the title company never sent it.  But by the time we had figured all this out it was after 5pm and nobody was to answer any phone at any place.  I stayed in town went over to bishops and had them cut on my hairs.  which I like very much and of course went out after that shopping, and to a friends party that was dull so we went to the BR and sang for a while.  Saturday was similar but we went to the flugtag which was entertaining, afterwards we went to the Virginia Cafe and hung out for a while until "The Village" started at the Broadway.  Good movie, disappointing, but good story.  I had myself all hyped up to be freaked out.  I'm not...  Sunday again was pretty much the same, more eating (noodlin and coldstone) another movie: the anchorman(way funny) and to the BR until our friend's show started.  But Dan didn't make it that long.  He was threatening to go sleep in the car at 1030pm, so I gave in and we went home and missed the CAC show at ash street and the last day party for noah.  But at the same time I'm glad because I'm wretchedly tired and working on a monday which is way unusual and he has a job interview today--- so everybody cross your fingers!  okay boring re-cap of my weekend.    aren't you glad you read it!  So I just called the title company re: friday's havoc, and they say they sent it and the chech was cashed.  Lovely!!!  This is why I don't work on mondays!%^&amp;$#@!@#*^!!!!!
