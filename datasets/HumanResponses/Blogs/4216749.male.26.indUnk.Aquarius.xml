      Mail in rebates are becoming the norm these days. Everything you buy has a mail in rebate. I recently purchased a new notebook computer, cell phone, and flash drive by the time I walked out of Best Buy I had seven rebates to send in. Mail in rebates are annoying because you have to pay the full price of the item not the advertised price. You have to pay taxes on the total price before rebates. Then to top it off you have to wait six to eight weeks to get your rebate. If the retail establishment really wanted to give the consumer a good deal they would make it a instant rebate.

      Titan (my dog) is my bestfriend. He greets me at the door when I come home. He'll always make me smile. When I'm upset he'll just come over and rest his head in my lap. It's true what they say that you can live without a pet, however you never really live without one.

      Citi cards revealed a plan to layoff over 1,100 employees on Tuesday. These employees now have to find a new job, this becomes a problem because there is not 1,100 job openings within other Citi locations or the surrounding area. I'm personally affected by this, I have worked with the company now for three years. I not concerned about finding another job, I'm concerned about finding a job that will allow me to work around my school schedule.

      Tomorrow I start college algebra, I'm nervous about starting this class. College algebra has been my Achilles heel for years. I don't understand algebra, I don't know why I hate it so much I just do. I can do statistics perfectly, but do ask me about algebra. I know I'll get through the class with a good grade, I'm just concerned because graduation depens on this class.

      It's difficlut to continue to work like normal now that we know were being closed down. I go into the office everyday knowing that it is one less day that I have a job. Management keeps telling us that nothing has changed, and that we need to continue to work hard. Thats easier said then done. Yes we need to keep working hard, however the desire to go the extra mile is now gone.

      Going back to school is a big decision to make.  After highschool I joined the Army.  After five years of service to this wonderful country, I found myself out of work and with no formal higher education.  I looked at my job otpions and decided that I didn't want to be a laborer for the  rest of my life.  Going back to school was not a problem for me, my problem lied with trying to go to school around my work scheduel.  I started out by going to night school, after obtaining my A. A. Degree in just eighteen months I applied to CSUSB.  I was orginally turned down by CSUSB due to a Math requirement.  After taking the math class at a local community college I was accepted to CSUSB.  With just a year and a half at CSUSB I'm going to graduate this comming spring.  At the time of graduation I'll have spent just three and a half years to obtain a four year degree.  It has been difficult, however I set a goal and worked hard to get there.  If I can do it anyone one can.
