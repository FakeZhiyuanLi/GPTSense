       I saw a Kerry/Edwards one a week ago. I pointed it out to my mom and we're both like... "Is that guy asking for a death sentence?!"  Kind of sad, really. Democrats don't even have to vote in Texas because it's no use, anyway. Stupid electoral college.

      now's the time to get them.  they're 6.99 each.  and so are the scarves.  sooo puuuurtty.  I went there wanting to get a shirt like the lacy black/white ones I keep wearing (cuz I like them and wearing these two all the time is a bit... gross), but they were ALL SOLD OUT.  And last time we went (saturday) there was an entire RACKFUL.  I was soooo freakishly mad.  And they were cheap, too!  either 3.97...?  (perhaps that's why they were sold out.)  but!  instead my mother got me strange "crop" pants (the kind that aren't long enough to be pants but not short enough to be capris..  annoying is the word for them... they just kinda hang at your ankles) that were on sale (of course).  but they were black and they are comfy, so yeah.  then I chose to get a skirt (of course) because I luuuuuuuurve them (who hasn't noticed yet?) and they're kinda sorta freaky but not to such an extent that they're urgly.  I lurve it.  But I can't wear it until summer (which starts in march here).  but I luuuuuurve it.  so maybe I'll wear it tomorrow anyways!  XDD  (see, I go ga-ga over skirts.)  anyhooooooo...  kai, you forgot to log out from neopets.  XDD  I'm gonna rs for you.  you should thaaaank me.  man, how do you LIVE with only 65 items stocked at one time?!  maaaaaan.  anyhow.  I'm going to go wear my skirt b/c I luuuuuuurve it!  (are you tired of me gushing over the skirt now?)  anyhow.  finished coloring the piccy, kai!!  it looks ubercool.  I erased the outlines for the hands and arms, so it's ALL determined by color.  it's aaaaaawesome.  lyke, uh, totally TUBULAR!  XDD  riiiiiiiiight.  ++sunny

      to start off... a little quizzy:   Elvish    urlLink   To which race of Middle Earth do you belong?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    =)  looking at the code for that ^ I can actually understand it!!!  I'm so proud of myself.  I seem to have misplaced my photoshop disc....  by any chance is it at one of your houses?   MENG DON'T BLEEP THIS PART =>  :: I want to make my OWN backgrounds and userlookups and blogs... The premade ones either have stupid citations messing them up or they have words where I don't think there should be words, etc.  And I'm getting sick of my solid-color backgrounds.  I think I can get enough tutorials to help me make them.  =)  you guys wanna help?  come over tomorrow and we'll wrestle the stupid technological world.  It'll be so much fun! ::   I'm all restock banned on neopets... but I did buy another Babyca!  for 380k, too.  =)  see, kai, you should learn from me.  (not just fair deals... GOOD deals.)  So now I'm freaking poor ("freaking poor") at 150k.   yay, kai, we're poor together!!  anyhooooo...  dreamland is not turning out to be a v. good read.  get-throughable, but not outstanding.  ++sunny

      gah!  I had to come home.  crappy crappy!  tian tian (1010) might not be in lux4 next semester!!!  nooooooooooo!!  anyhow.  I MUST FIND OUT AFTER WE GO BACK TO SCHOOL.  MUST.  KNOW.  XDD  anyhow.  I feel like making layouts.  but I don't know hooooow.  I must drag everyone over someday and figure out how to make layouts.  for neopets of course.  XP  then I can make ones that I like and I don't have to keep stealing other ppls.  but then I'd hafta figure out the code, wouldn't I?  I haaaaaaaate codes.  kailing, you still hafta pick up the ugly petpet trade.  I think I'm gonna go update my userlookup again cuz I just got rs banned.  or I could go read dreamland.  ++sunny

      I want to go to the library.  I bet they got bunches of new displays up since I was last there (about a month ago).  I want to reeeeeeaaaaaaaad more books!!  oh, kailing, I got { c a t a l  y  s t if you want to read it.    anyhow.  I'm bored.  I wanna go to the library.  I'll even walk there, if it comes to that.  or bike there.  biking might be easier.  then bike back.  shouldn't take all that long.  ++sunny

      only a week left of winter break!!!!!!  then there's another SEMESTER staring us in the eye....  another SEMESTER!  T-T  anyhow.  am bumming around at home doing almost nothing.  oh!  I just noticed.  the blog thing is back to normal.  I like this normal one waaaaay better.  anyhow.  I'm bored.  but I'm determined to enjoy this last week to the fullest.  oh!  yesterday I just read this book called "this lullaby".  it's very interesting.  it's about this girl, remy, who doesn't believe in love b/c her mother's on her fifth husband.  and then she meets this guy, dexter, and of course they fall madly in love (even though remy is denying it) and they go thru hardships, etc.etc.  ya.  v. stereotypical, but good.  in a stereotypical way.  and it's "appropriate", too, so meng won't freak out.  ya.  I started reading it and didn't go to sleep until I'd finished the book.  *sigh*  I think I listened to the dido CD 6 times through on repeat while reading that book.  -__-;;  you know, perhaps going to school isn't that bad.  *sigh*  ho-kai.  outta stuff to ramble on about.  ++sunny

      I HAVE TO STAY UP FOR THE DEADLY DICE.  and I must keep kailing and meng up with me, too.  heeeeeeeehehhehehehehee  I am being GPA whore-ish because I'm thinking that by depriving them of their sleep, they would lose brain cells and I would beeeeeeeaaaaaaat them.  except I'm not that mean.  and I don't really want to beat anyone except jack, really.  and that's just b/c I have an unhealthy obsession with him and his grades.  (but of course I didn't just say that.)  you know, I think having ppl telling me 24/7 that I like jack is making my mind twisted.  Now I'm not sure if I do or don't.  -___-;;  (though I still think it's mostly a big fat NO)  (but my mind is being twisted.)  (I hate a twisted mind.)  (AND I have no clue what it feels like to like someone... so I think I don't.  because I think [from what I've heard], that if you like someone, you know you like that person.)  (so... happy verdict.. I don't like him.)  see, being up at 2 in the morning on a freaking annoying laptop is getting to me.  I really really hate laptops.  oh, and if you feed me any of my own words from up there ^ later today or tomorrow or whatever, I will categorically deny EVERYTHING.  hehe.  (I can be impractical at 2 in the morning.)  but he's reaaaaaaally pretty.  for a guy.  "pretty", notice, NOT "hot" or "cute" or god forbid.... "sexy".  geeeeeez.  that is SO disturbing.  and he's nice.  kinda.  once he stops being impatient.  which is... almost never.  -____-;;  he's a lot nicer in person than he is online.  imho, of course.  kailing is rambling on about mints.  right.  IT'S 2 NOW!!  ++sunny

I'm on neopets right now b/c I'm bored. do you think walmart would be open today? I want to go buy some yarn.  anyhow. need to go buy pressies on neopets cuz I've been a huge lazy bum and didn't buy anything. except for a vortex negg for meng, and that's because that's not even unbuyable.  gosh. there are major money-making sharks on the tp and auction chat. though there is a babyca being sold right now for 360k... I really really want it, but I must learn self control. :(  yeah. anyhow. kailing! get on so I can neomail you instead of typing like this.  I have a feeling this will be a major pain in the arse to read.  hehe  ++sunny

      *coff*  at 1.30 in the morning.  because I like to stay up.  :)  Neopets is freakish fast at this time of day.  night.  morning.  I got one of the new mince pies... I think I'm the first in neopia to get it!  am selling in shop for 99,999.  hope someone will buy.  *crosses fingers*  too bad restocks are few and far inbetween in the morning.  *sigh*  I NEED TO GET NP TO BUY GIIIIFTS.  I must first reach 5mill, though.  then I can splurge.  I'm tired.  I should sleep.  but only half an hour to deadly dice!!  must stay up.  now, what can I talk about for thirty minutes?  let's talk about my favorite subject.  *dun dun dun*  meng and jack!!  =)   now who didn't expect that one?  oh, and btw, changed my userlookup on neopets.  the old one was getting boring.  I did the new one ALL by myself!  no help from ANYONE!  go me.  now.  back to meng and jack. (I sound like some pompous TV announcer dude... "and now back to the show!")  I think they're perfect.  they're cute.  they're opposites.  they'd bring out the best in each other.  I hope.  =)  it would be so utterly cuuuuuuuuuuute.  now.  if only they'd stop being stubborn fools and see things the way I see them.  that would be lovely.  pah.  jack has good grades.  stupid git beat me in english!!  I'm mad.  >_  but I beat him in everything else.  =)  yes.  call me obsessed.  I know his grades.  (but he was the one that told me his ID.)  (and he was the one that wanted me to walk around with him to see his grades.)  (so it's really not my fault.)  (PLUS... he knows all my grades, too.)  (b/c we just walked around the school looking at our grades.)  (...which means he prob. knows my ID number, too.)  (DARN HIM.)  anyhow.  yes.   didn't knit at all today because of cut.  must knit extra hard tomorrow!!  I want kailing to come over tomorrow.  so we can neopet together!  hehe.  alrighty.  I think I shall sleep now.  *COFF*  still hacking my lungs out.  now... only 20 minutes to deadly dice!  w0ot.  this shall henceforth be known as the entry with choppy paragraphs.  "paragraphs".  yeah.  ++sunny

      eileen went over.  there was a HUGE asian powwow.  mao lao shi was there with his wife, which was...  interesting , to say the least.  I walked in and I heard whispers of, "who's that?  is she a relative?  where are her parents?" and kerry's parents/anyone else who knew me going, "oh, no, she's just a neighbor."  then I heard whispers of, "wow, she's so tall!"  "her hair's so long!"  "why isn't she skinny like the rest of america?" (okay maybe not the last one but still...)  anyhow. went upstairs.  knit.  watched spirited away.  again.  in response to me taking out my knitting needles and starting to knit: Kerry's cousins: YOU KNIT?! kerry: you're a TEENAGER that knits? kerry's cousin: dude, you're an uberdork! kerry: but but but... people don't knit until they're like... 80! me: -__-;; I like knitting.  during the movie: me: I wonder if I can knit without looking. kerry: that's just what I was about to ask. me: yay!  I can do it! kerry's cousin: UBERUBERdork.  later: me: oo, I wonder how far around my neck this will go. ::tries it on:: kerry's cousin (david...?  I think): dude, if you don't knit until you're 80, then you don't actually wear what you knit until you're at least 100. me: thank you.  right.  then after the movie, everyone migrated in a big mass to kerry's room because it has swords.  oh, and there was this REALLY annoying little sevvie there... no one knew who she was, but we all assumed she was one of kerry's cousins.  (even kerry didn't know everyone at his house... it was kinda freaky.)  she's the type of person who thinks that she knows absolutely everything in the world.  for example: we were in a room.  A LOT of ppl were in a room. her: wow, it's hot in here.  I'm getting claustrophobic. ::leaves:: ::mass snickering:: ::comes back in:: kerry: I thought you were claustrophobic...? her: gosh, you guys are so gully-i-ble.  (that's how she pronounces it... I swear) kerry: oh, yeah, so perhaps you should leave. her: *counts ppl in room*  oh, there's only 6 ppl in here.  i'm not claustrophobic w/6 ppl. ::someone else comes in:: her: okay, I'm claustrophobic now. ::leaves:: kerry: so what does she do when she goes to school?  walk in a classroom, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, oh, no, mrs. teacher, there's too many ppl in here.  I can't learn. everyone: *laff*  god.  she is SO annoying.  kerry was making fun of the word "sevvie"... "what do you mean, sevvie?  it sounds like you've severed your arm or something.  oh, look, I don't have an arm!  I'm a sevvie!"  anyhow.  back to the mass migration to kerry's room...  we went in.  played w/swords.  then kerry was waving around his little three-section staff stick swingy thingy, and he hit the lightbulb.  and it shattered.  like... shattered. everywhere.  everyone got high in his room b/c of the gas inside the light bulb.  yeah.  and so I was on my knees helping him pick up the glass shards... and I cut my hand.  like... really really cut my hand.  I was bleeding everywhere.  the glass cut in a triangular shape, too, so I just had this flap of skin hanging out and blood was gushing EVERYWHERE.  so then I ran like heck into his bathroom... where I bled all over his sink and towels.  it was... strange.  so I was cupping my hand with my other hand, and kerry comes into the bathroom (which was crowded beyond imagination... it's amazing the morbid interest little kids have in blood...) with this bottle of STUFF... and he wants to pour it over my wound.  And I was going, "get that thing AWAY from me!" and he goes, "No.  It doesn't hurt a bit!  See?  It says right here... 'NO HURT'." I reply, "Dude.  Those things LIE." "Dude.  If you don't let me pour this over you, your hand's gonna get infected and it's gonna fall off.  Do you want to walk around school w/ppl making fun of your fallen-off hand?" "NO." "See?  Let me pour this stuff over you." All this time I've been trying to get my hand out of his reach... which was how I got blood all over his stuff.  right.  so after a lot of running away from him and hiding and stuff (which didn't really work really well... as it was his house...), I finally agreed to let him pour that stuff over me (and it really didn't hurt.... darnit).  yeah.  and now I can't feel my fingers cuz I've lost so much blood.  I told him that, and he got me this warm little pouch thing, and I told him that I couldn't feel the warm.  then he felt my fingers and got freaked.  yeah.  and so now my wound feels REALLY REALLY warm and I can't feel my fingers.  and my wound is all purple and brown and there's all this dried blood around it... and it's throbbing like heck.  and I think I cut right on a vein b/c it's standing out really really clearly.  and I can't get blood to my fingers.  yes. anyhow.  that's my little adventure of the day.  my hand really hurts now.  IT REALLY HURTS.  yeah.  oh, what do you think of the new blog?  ++sunny

      okay.  for my own purposes, I am going to recount the entire history of the movie group that I'm in.  now dubbed "the mean group" by jeff.  but he doesn't count.  except I really do think we were mean in rejecting all those ppl.  anyways.  Day 1: Friday Events - we got the project.  we watched the one hour photo thing.  I formed semi-ties with Su and Melanie.  (or so I thought)  Deanna told me she was working with Meng.  Went to lunch and tied myself to Kailing.  got home, called Meng, and somehow gave her impression that she was working with me.  Attached - Su, Melanie, Meng, Kailing Detached - no one Rejected - no one  Day 2 and 3: Weekend Events - got online and chatted like the apocalypse. Attached - Chuan Detached - Su Rejected - forgot  Day 4: Monday Events - mass chaos ensues.  6th, 7th, 8th get assignment.  more chaos. Attached - Didy, it seemed Detached - Didy, it seemed Rejected - Didy, it seemed  Day 5: Tuesday Events - masses of ppl asking, more chaos, deadline draws near... Attached - Jack Detached - Melanie detached herself... or so it seemed. Rejected - hoards of ppl.    Day 6: Wednesday Events - Mel didn't seem to have left after all... and more chaos.  and anger now.  grr. Attached - Didy Detached - Meng and Deanna. Rejected - even more ppl.  In all, rejected: Didy once, Monica, Su, Lisa Wang, Bing, Jeff Shi, Meng, Deanna, Harry Shen, Valerie, Perini, Grace Chang, Melanie.  and probably more.  T_T  *sigh*  on a brighter note...  MRS STANTON IS PREGNANT!!  AND SHE'S TEACHING AT JASPER NEXT YEAR!!  =DDDDD  ++sunny

      ...depression/despair sets in.  I feel so bad.  first, the whole deal with ning and jack.  then I had to go do my chinese hw, and my mother kept harping on me about my hair and how I look and my grades and how I conduct myself.  so then I got to the third day of the little workbook thing and she yelled at me some more so I just stopped working and came upstairs and burned myself a CD.  then i went to my room to contemplate, then she came upstairs and yelled at me for being so messy.  so then I just loitered around for a bit then decided to go wash my hair.  and now it's 2 in the morning and I feel so so so crappy.  The whole thing with ning is just so... stupid.  it's beyond words, really, but I still feel horrible about it.  I regret telling her anything at all about Jack now.  I regret even mentioning his name to her now.  I mean, it's just a little adolescent thing and it's normal and I  know  he doesn't even really care about it, but I feel... betrayed? by ning.  I told her and told her and told her to not tell...  of all the topics she could have chosen to talk about, why did she have to talk about that particular one?  I don't know, I suppose it's just her nature, but still.  A little bit of tact couldn't have hurt her, right?  And she told Jeff about it, too.  Maybe I should just stop telling her things.  Plus, now I have to find another dead body, unless I want to take the pictures without Jack here.  I'm also quitting violin for good today.  I have to tell my teacher.  And then I have to go to Chinese school without my homework finished and tell the teacher another bad lie about why I couldn't do it.  I'll still have to finish it when I get home, though, because my parents will make me.  Jack can't even come over today because well, one, he doesn't want to, and two, I don't really want him to, either.  So we're going to end up working twice, probably, during the week.  And lord knows how long those days are.  Then the days afterwards spent making up all the work we didn't do.  Now I don't even know how to tell people that they can't be in my movie group.  Or more like, Melanie's movie group.  I think she's choosing people.  I thought Meng was working with Deanna, so I didn't even think to bring up her name because Melanie and Deanna... don't really get along.  I think Melanie's thinking of me, her, Kailing, Chuan for sure, and maybe Kerry, Devansh, and Jackie.  I think Ning wants to work with Jackie, though, and Yini wants to work with Ning, so...  Everything's so messed up.  whatever.  All I know is that Kailing said yes and Chuan said yes and Melanie said yes.  so.  whatever.  I'm so very tired.  My mother's still mad at me, and my father's asleep, and my head hurts and back hurts and eyes hurt and I feel so bad.  The bed is looking very inviting right now.  Maybe I should try crying.  I've heard it helps.  Or write another star note.  ++sunny

      I do so hope no one knows my neopets screenname... no one dangerous, that is.  jeff came up to us after math class today and said he knew that I was trying to get meng and jack together.  that is so very disturbing.  wow.  okay.  I do hope he doesn't go talk to jack.  I do hope that if he does, jack will think him an idiot.  oh holy crap.  this is a potentially explosive situation here.  jack likes perfume.  or, according to him, only that one kind.  okay.  he's gay.  right.  anyways, I don't seem to be in a blogging mood right now.  I keep writing kailing notes.  and I want to call meng, but my mom's on the phone with her mom.  my grandmom.  grandmom.  lol.  she's too conservative of a person to be a grandmom.  she's the pricipal of a school.  she's a grandmother.  lol.  wahahahaha.  anyways.  both my grandmothers are principals, actually...  tho the one on my dad's side is definitely 100% a grandma.  or maybe even a granny.  anyways.  my fingers are all stained now with the markers.  lol.  I'm so careless.  now.  for some interesting parts of my convo with jack!  beD XTC: you really suck dilapidatedshack: oh! dilapidatedshack: did you tell ning she sucked? dilapidatedshack: because she was really confused beD XTC: it was spaz dilapidatedshack: spaz? beD XTC: I did it to like 10 ppl in the hall dilapidatedshack: .... dilapidatedshack: you are really really strange beD XTC: she let me borrow paper for the dbq beD XTC: =) dilapidatedshack: ... dilapidatedshack: and so.... she sucks?  beD XTC: Mrs. Campo is going to hate me beD XTC: =) dilapidatedshack: and you're happy...? beD XTC: sure beD XTC: why not dilapidatedshack: lol beD XTC: I hat eher too  dilapidatedshack: guess what? beD XTC: hm/ dilapidatedshack: I got an 88 on my stupid math test dilapidatedshack: because the teacher told us that the second part was so much harder than the first part dilapidatedshack: and it turned out to be so much easier dilapidatedshack: so all three questions I missed were on the first part dilapidatedshack: the first three questions of the test beD XTC: hahahahaha beD XTC: lol beD XTC: I got another 100 dilapidatedshack: .... dilapidatedshack: argh dilapidatedshack: you annoy me sometimes beD XTC: lol  beD XTC: why the hell is there a reading assignment? dilapidatedshack: because... dilapidatedshack: they want you to read? beD XTC: screw stanton  haha.  there we go.  that buffered up this pathetic entry.  lol.  am still worrying over the potential explosive situation of my neopets userlookup.  =/  ++sunny

      I finished all my english homework today!  and considering how much I abhor doing english homework, that's quite an accomplishment for me.  yay!  now just the easy stuff left for tomorrow (aka algebra, french, bio).  go me!  and art...  but that's okay.  anyways, went to walmart and bought shiny metallic markers!  (the ones that erica have, kailing)  and then I went and wrote notes to you guys!  I got the markers under the pretense that I needed them for my commapps project.  (and I do!  just don't NEED them... more like want to use them)  so anyways, then I just sat around for some time and ate and sat around some more.... and now I'm here typing this and thinking that I might actually sleep before midnight today!!  it would be so astounding if I did... I mean... wow!  unprecedented!!  or perhaps I'll go and write more pointless, stupid notes just so I can use my markers... yes, that sounds nice, too...  lol.  ++sunny

      you know, I woke up this morning and my first thought was, "bio project".  then I thought, "Jack's in Toronto."  then I thought, "He's coming back tonight."  Then I went back to sleep.  And now I'm wondering what ning would say if she knew that those were my first thoughts of the day.  (actually, I know what she's gonna say.  -__-;;)  so anyways, all I've gotten done all weekend was my next chapter for OMM.  I wanna finish socsem questions today, as well as my one life lesson.  hmm.... and then maybe if I finish ALL my homework today, I can go to the DMA tomorrow!  =D  +EDIT+  alright, DMA is closed on mondays.  there goes that.  psh.  ++sunny

      I'm so tired.  I wanna sleep.  I dun wanna go to the freaking orphanage tomorrow.  gosh.  I have enough to do without doing other just completely random stuff.  anyways, ning and I always have very interesting conversations.  she told me that when she first saw jack, she thought he was cute.  now, isn't that something???  that's a sign man, a sure sign.  (they're meant to be...)  see... ning at least is a blip on jack's radar.  so... the blip just has to become stronger... then all will be well.  oh, yesterday I had a dream about jack.  it was really really freaky.  I dreamt that his plane crashed.  -__-;;  isn't that just real nice of me?  okay, I want to finish my english homework before tomorrow morning.  can I do it?  (probly not... only 20 minutes of today left)  oh, but joy!  I am back down to soup faerie level.  =D  so many tests next week.... sooo many......  ++sunny

      god.  I am so freaking tired.  I should've gone to sleep half an hour ago... but I got on neopets and read the news... the better than you this time is for sutek's tomb!!  so I beat it and got 3rd place and a new trophy.  =D  it's so much easier now when they reshuffle the board when you're outta moves... I had to get it reshuffled 3 times to get above a 10000 score.  but I did it!!  and now I'm above soup faerie level again...  anyways, ning is really freaking me out now.  if she actually has her little "talk" with jack, I shall have to kill her.  went over to jack's today... ended staying until 11 again.  anyways, basically got microscope done.  it looks a bit... haphazard, but it still works.  thinking to paint it black so I can disguise some of the... disformities.  (I got to a point where I didn't care what it looked like anymore.)  his parents went the the PTSA thing about psh/pwsh... so it was just us two for 2-3 hours.  and we watched TV while we ate dinner.  it was kinda funny.  his kitchen is freaking small.  then we decided to work at the dinner table and watch TV while we worked.  we were watching millionaire, and jack's guesses are freakishly accurate.  he guessed all of his right while I didn't.  I mean, there was a question on sherman's march to the sea, and I did a project on that thing and didn't know the answer while he just guessed it and got it right.  freaky as heck.  and then he finally stopped listening to techno music cuz he "got tired of it after listening to it for 7 hours" on tuesday.  oh, you know the blackout on the east US early this year?  well, it turns out that jack was actually still back in toronto when that happened, so he was actually part of the blackout.  and he told me that it was one of the days where it was actually HOT in canada... 95degrees or something, and he happened to be running a fever of 102 when the power went out.  so he was just lying on the bed with no air conditioning and no hot water just sweating to death.  (I laughed... not sure if I was supposed to or not.  but it was funny.)  and then he moved here in time for the current event on it.  isn't that just funny?  anyhow.  so now I smell like jack's house and I'm freakishly tired and it's 12.30 and I have to be at school at 7.30 for a freakin sinfonia rehearsal... jack laughed at me when I told him.  and oh my god he has SO MANY medals.  he has like plaques and medals and ribbons and certificates ALL OVER the place.  he got embarrassed, I think, when I just wandered around marveling at it all.  He won a NATIONAL piano competition... and he said it was "just crap".  I mean... ???????  and then he told me that when he was in canada, he was playing accompaniment to some of the symphonies there... I was like, WOW.  and he had a piano teacher who drove from colorado to here every two weeks just to give him lessons.  and they had no set time for the lessons, either... it was just teach teach teach play play play until one of them got too tired.  I mean... that's just astounding.  he's gonna get into harvard for sure.  (from talent.)  it made me feel really really depressed about my 4.3 in algebra one.  -__-;;  so anyways.  I still have my commapps project to do.  this bio project is really killing me.  and my chinese school teacher wants me to go to an orphanage thing on saturday morning and give a one-hour speech on the customs of america or something... in CHINESE.  I was like... oh, holy crap, PLEASE NO.  but alas... my treacherous mother already agreed for me.  while I was at jack's house.  so now... a freaking speech to do, too.  right.  commapps project.  I'm gonna die next year.  ++sunny

      oh my gosh, I love jack.  he is such a nice, sweet person.  I can take the TXML AND do the bio project.  yeeeeeeees.  this is good.  this is very good.  but this also means that I have to take the test in like... record time.  I told him to wait for me until 4.35.... and.... so that gives me like 15 minutes for the test.  oh my god I am going to bomb it, but at least I've taken it.  alright.  I can breathe now.  I can stop freaking out and cursing gabriel in my head now.  okay.  okay.  okay.  and now I can go finish my humanities homework in peace.  yes yes yes yes yes yes yes.  ++sunny

      I'm sitting at my computer and I still smell jack.  o__O;;  his deodorant or whatever.  really smells.  *nose twitches*  anyhow.  he came over at 3.30 today.  even though he was supposed to come at 3.  but I knew that would happen, which was why I told him to come at 3 and not 3.30.  or else he would have come at 4.  -___-;;  that's sad.  so!  he came, and he didn't leave until 8.  and I ate breakfast at 11.  so I didn't eat for 9 hours today.  stupid guy wouldn't eat at our house so I had to keep him company while the rest of my family ate dinner.  and they had potatoes, too.  and I was freaky hungry.  so.  all we got done in 4.5 hours was: how the person dies (you would not have any clue how long it took us to decide this... it was like "gunshot then drown" or "strangle then drown" or "how about she gets killed with a gun then dumped in a forest then a forest fire comes through and then a flood later and then the body gets found?") who the suspects are gonna be and we're gonna do my idea  it was a freakishly pathetic afternoon.  and all we did was go around and look through the book and talk.  jack has watched a freakish amount of movies... he kept making references to movies and I was so lost.  then finally I told him that I don't watch movies so he should stop referring to them.  another really pathetic thing: our final idea for how the girl dies came from my brother.  we both felt really really stupid after that.  (about an hour before this, we figured out a person can only die one time.... -__-;;)  gosh.  now I'm so freakishly tired and my brain hurts.  too much planning...  jack finally figured out that I like to make things complicated.  **COFF  poor dear.  anyhow.  he's going to toronto next weekend (for no apparent reason, it seems) and he refuses to work on his birthday, so I'm going over tuesday and thursday.  joy.  ++sunny

      hahahahaha.  finally told him what my idea was.  I told him we were going to rebuild a whole lab station and everything and then make a story and make pictures and make files and photobooks and evidence cases and suspect backgrounds and newspaper articles and clippings and how letters have to be hidden along in the lab station to make it a mystery for mrs kite to solve and all the gluing and cutting and pasting and planning and how we have to write a solution page to it all, too, and well...  reaction: beD XTC (11:31:25 PM): umm.... beD XTC (11:31:28 PM): hmm... beD XTC (11:31:31 PM): but thats way too much work  XDD  and I didn't even tell him all that stuff.  just the very basics.  building a lab, writing a story, making files.  poor poor poor dear.  he tried to suggest other stuff... like writing a story or making a board game... but I told him to be creative.  hmm.  poor poor person.  and besides, can you imagine a forensics clue??  it'll be like... the instruction booklet will be a report.  the game will just be a prop.  and photographic evidence would be a pain.  and it'd be awkward.  oh, well.  I'm stubborn.  and I've put WAY too much thought into my plan for it not to be what we do.  we'll just have to fight it out tomorrow.  I have a feeling I'll be the one doing most of the work on this project.  but that's okay.  as long as he cuts out the stuff.  *sigh*  it'll be so much work!!  but it'll be SO fun.  I'm excited!  ++sunny

      they think I like Jack.  Now, don't you agree with me?  They're both on drugs.  They're both old hippies tripping on acid.  btw, Meng, here's a mneumonic for trigonometry! Some Old Hippy Caught Another Hippy Tripping On Acid. I told angela that last year when we were learning it and she still remembers!  which means that it actually works.  =D  anyhow.  I'm tired.  I don't want to do homework.  I have chinese school tomorrow.  I hate chinese school.  with a passion.  but at least I can quit violin.  after school lets out in may this year, I'm done with violin for good.  yay!  I have enough art credits already, anyways, so it's not like it matters much to me anyways.  jack's coming over tomorrow after chinese at... 3, I think.  so I've gotta go and make sure that all potentially embarrassing items are out of sight.  my room is... a disaster area.  gosh.  I hate cleaning.  I hate jack for making me clean.  but he's bringing his other homework cuz he thinks we're gonna get bored and tired with biology, and then we can do our other homework together.  which gives me a reason to procrastinate some more, so perhaps I don't hate him, after all.  anyhow.  he keeps signing on and off and it's really driving me nuts.  -__-;;  I've been talking with him on and off since noon, and it's almost 10 now.  and I don't think his window's ever been closed because he keeps IMing me.  hweaoithowaie .  at math today I kept having spazz attacks cuz epiphanies kept happening.  and then I came up with a way of patting kailing's head that won't kill off any of her precious brain cells, but then it causes my shaking of her head to be kind of... strange.  I have to shake VERY GENTLY, which kinda ruins the point of the whole thing.  beD XTC (7:59:50 PM): I hate coloring beD XTC (7:59:58 PM): I want like a little sister that will color for me dilapidatedshack (8:00:27 PM): ..... dilapidatedshack (8:00:31 PM): my brother won't color for me beD XTC (8:00:51 PM): sisters will beD XTC (8:00:55 PM): cuz they like art dilapidatedshack (8:00:57 PM): they so will not dilapidatedshack (8:01:05 PM): if I were your sister, I wouldn't color for you beD XTC (8:01:12 PM): I"M saying the sister was 7 dilapidatedshack (8:01:21 PM): ... dilapidatedshack (8:01:23 PM): she still won't dilapidatedshack (8:01:29 PM): 7-year-olds are freakishly annoying beD XTC (8:02:02 PM): ...no MY sister will beD XTC (8:02:09 PM): so there dilapidatedshack (8:02:16 PM): you don't HAVE a sister beD XTC (8:02:24 PM): ..... dilapidatedshack (8:02:29 PM): do you? beD XTC (8:02:30 PM): well you didn't have to be so plain about it beD XTC (8:02:36 PM): no I dont'  isn't that funny?  I've already told meng on the phone... but still.  it's funny.  oh, why does everyone think jack's weird?  it's so strange.  but I guess...  it makes sense.  he's too... HAPPY....  scary.  freaky scary.  okay, I'm obsessing again.  that's okay, though.  no, it's not.  alright!  let's talk about my AMC filled day.  I got up at 11.30, ate breakfast, and then got online.  two minutes later, had to go downstairs to do AMC.  and thus it started.  AMC AMC AMC... gosh.  I hate that thing.  you're supposed to do one AMC test in 70 minutes... but I kept going upstairs and downstairs and doing ANTZ and stuff... so it took me 3 hours.  more or less.  less, probably.  then I went to math class.  learned... math.  ning was so wrong.  =D  but then again... I was, too, on some stuff.  (not that I just admitted that.)  wheee.  I'm bored.  I still have... hum reading alg bookwork eng reading studying french workbook left to do.  not bad, I guess.  WATERCOLOR STILL LIFE IN ART....  gosh.  the stupid water won't DRY.  .twoaithwaoeithoawie.  I've got problems with watercolor.  aaargh.  but alcohol is really cool when it's used with watercolor... really really cool.  =D  bah.  I feel bad for not doing homework... haweiofahweoi.  I'll go finish algebra and english reading and french today, then, I guess... all easy busy-work.  ++sunny

TT-TT     Obsessions=  Jack and Meng, Jack's butt-ugly rabbits, GW, fics, H/Hr, MiroSan, refill index stickers, Jack, Meng's lack of boyfriend, scarves, yarn, knitting      Desires=  a passing grade for biology...  finish bio project, done with quizzes/tests forever, kill all the 9th grade english teachers, kill off al of kai's brain cells except for 2, shoot jack, SWITCH OUT OF MY COMMAPPS CLASS       Your preferred…    Actor=  dead jack     Actress=  dead jack crossdressing as girl     Singer/group=  my band called "dead jack"     Saying=  die, jack, die.  [OMIGOD OMIGOD OH. MY. FREAKING. GOD.  (from lunch today.  =D)]     Color=  this one, whatever it is.  just randomly put in CC3366.  dunno what color.  lol.     Animal=  dolphins.  and dead jack.     Scent=  jack's body rotting.  and cucumber melon.  and sheer freesia.  and sun-ripened raspberry.  and victoria secret's pear glace.     Facial expression=  the one I get that Meng always goes "uh oh" to.  Along with my little-girl high-pitched voice and freaky little laugh.     Feeling=  whatever I'd feel if jack died.  or if jack got together with meng.  =)     Music type=  all - doesn't really matter to me.  as long as it's not schoenberg.  cuz I got problems with him.        How you feel about…    Parents=  they're... parents.  sometimes good, sometimes annoying, always loving [even if in strange ways].     Siblings=  **COFF  yeah.     Friends=  makes my jack-filled life bearable.     Enemies=  you're dumb, stinky, and ugly.     Boyfriend/girlfriend/crush=  meng and jack, o'course.  [jack can live if he's with meng.  see how nice I am?]     Pets=  none     Others?=  jack should go die.  after the bio project.

[well, half of that survey was just rendered pointless with that resolution...]    anyhow.  found out who liked jack, supposedly.  caroline told me before lunch today.  and I really really freaked.  I would not stop saying "OH MY GOD" to kailing.  and I pounded her.  a lot.  literally.  because I was so freaked out.  then I told her who.  then she freaked out.  then deanna felt left out and gave me funny looks.  then I caused kailing to hit her elbow.  I said sorry, but I don't think she believed me.  I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M WORKING WITH HIM.  anyhow.  this morning I woke up and thought I just imagined that whole thing... then I came home after school today and he talked to me and I found out that we WERE working together, after all.  I kept dodging the question of who I'm working with.  I wonder how long I can do it before it leaks.  But then I have no clue WHY I'm dodging the question... it's not like I'm ashamed to be working with him.  [I feel kinda stupid, but that's it.]  But it is a bit awkward.  conversation was so stilted.  then we talked about other stuff and it wasn't so stilted anymore.  our convo: first... beD XTC: wen bio? dilapidatedshack: huh? beD XTC: project dilapidatedshack: yes, I know dilapidatedshack: when what? dilapidatedshack: when to work on it? beD XTC: yes dilapidatedshack: oh dilapidatedshack: tomorrow? beD XTC: no beD XTC: we don't even have a book dilapidatedshack: I do  ++time passes++  dilapidatedshack: any idea for biology? beD XTC: nope beD XTC: not right now beD XTC: no book beD XTC: can't read beD XTC: so yea dilapidatedshack: ... dilapidatedshack: ookay then dilapidatedshack: so when do you want to meet? beD XTC: umm.... beD XTC: last 2 weekends of jan? dilapidatedshack: ...  ++time passes++  dilapidatedshack: are you getting the book, too? beD XTC: yes dilapidatedshack: which chapters are we doing? beD XTC: don t'know dilapidatedshack: can you meet this weekend? dilapidatedshack: to figure out what we're doing? beD XTC: why this one? dilapidatedshack: ...because it's the soonest one? beD XTC: ok beD XTC: but I haven't read the book beD XTC: so I wont know anything dilapidatedshack: I'll bring it dilapidatedshack: and you can glance through it beD XTC: bring it where? dilapidatedshack: wherever we're meeting beD XTC: ok dilapidatedshack: ... dilapidatedshack: where are we meeting? beD XTC: probably ur house beD XTC: this time beD XTC: and my house the next beD XTC: doesn't matter beD XTC: I'm busy reading the hot zone beD XTC: =) dilapidatedshack: ...  argh.  lovely teamwork there.  anyhow... realized jack has speech impediments! beD XTC (6:19:00 PM): so yea beD XTC (8:09:28 PM): so yea beD XTC (8:34:39 PM): so yea  hahahahahhahaha.

        FREAK FREAK FREAK.  GPA MY FREAKING ASS, DAMMIT!   TWO regular classes is already a whole friggin lot less than more ppl are taking, not that I even CARE about what other people are taking because it's MY LIFE.  You went and got a fancy little education at some esteemed college and look at your fucking co-workers: THEY'RE STILL THE SCUM OF THE EARTH.  I'm doing a lot better NOW than a lot of the ppl you see every day did in ALL THEIR FRIGGIN LIFE so I'm not going to starve on the streets when I grow up NO MATTER WHAT.  SO SHUT THE FUCK UP AND LET ME LIVE MY LIFE THE WAY I WANT TO.    DISS ENSEMBLE AND   DIE  .

      right!  I'm a bit late getting into the new year spirit... but here goes!  RESOLUTIONS: ++ STOP OBSESSING  (hah, what a joke) ++ get better grades (of course) ++ cut my hair (like that's happening) ++ write a story (already did!) ++ stop listening to songs obsessively (hahahahaha) ++ get thinner (that's my mom.  she's making me put it on here.  go away, mom.) ++ get my mom to stop thinking kerry and I are going out (COUGH) ++ watch more movies (I feel miserly) ++ return stuff on time (kai, oil pastels still here...) ++ play neopets more successfully (finally!  one I might be able to keep...) ++ read more good books (finding good books is harder than searching for a needle in a haystack these days) ++ stop making stupid resolutions (gotcha.)  there we go!  now...   best parts of 2003 ++ meeting jack (hehehehe) ++ freshmen orientation (that was fun) ++ walking home with Jackie (ah, the good old days) ++ STATE MATHCOUNTS (the best two days of my life) ++ mock trial!!  (I swear they poisoned our food... I hate wilson) ++ kerry's family get-togethers (family... and me) ++ getting to know meng and kailing better (=)) ++ sleepovers (hahaha... SLEEPovers... sure) ++ kai's mom's potatoes!  (yum) ++ ENSEMBLE!!!!  (nuff said) ++ meeting ms. kite (becuz she is the bestest teacher ever.  except for mrs. s)  there we go!  worst parts of 2003: ++ EXAMS ++ STARTING HIGH SCHOOL ++ END OF ENSEMBLE  I think that's it.  hehehehe.  alright!  A lot has happened since Dec. 30... so here's a HUUUUGE update!  alright.     wednesday , I stayed home and played neopets.  as usual.  then, my mom came home and we went to a party.  new years party and all that jazz, ya know.  so we went.  we went to jihai (right?)'s house, and... I got bored.  severely bored.  and tian was there.  so we went and asked our parents if we could come to my house.  and they said yes.  so tian came over.  I didn't wanna bring her, but she was just kinda... there, so she came.  yeah.  and let me tell you, she is THE most annoying girl EVER.  tracee, meet tian.  I mean... she is even more GPA whorish than tracey.  and that's saying something.  OH MY GOSH...  yeah.  so she came, and we watched ocean's eleven.  cuz she hadn't seen that before.  so then after that, we drew pictures.  cuz she wanted to.  yeah.  and she was SO TOTALLY comparing me to herself.  Every few seconds she was like, "Let me see what you're doing."  So I let her see.  and uuuugh.  I just drew stick figures after a while, cuz I don't like my pictures being compared with other ppl's.  (btw, mine was WAY better.  XD  I'll scan them in later if I have time.)  Yeah.  then later we went to my room and just did stuff.  I've forgotten what.  And she tried to learn how to do the ribbon stuff I do.  ha!  she failed miserably.  And then...  we went online.  and she went on my brother's computer.  and she just did stuff.  she changed the background so it's a picture of the moon now with her poem on it.  gosh.  her stupid ugly poem.  my zen poetry is SO much better.  XDD  and then she got online and talked to ppl and she was all, "Do you know gary?  he goes to jasper." and trying to make it seem like she's more popular than me or something.  psh.  stupid.  (if you can't tell, I really don't like her much.)  so then we were online until like 1.30 or something in the morning, and then she went into my room and wanted to do calligraphy, so I refilled my pens with ink and just as I got the pen working, her mom FINALLY picked her up and she was gone.  she was over from like 7.30 to 2.  that is a freakishly long time to be with someone you don't like much.  yeah.  then my parents came home, too, with my brother, who was playing with jihai and tian's brother.  so then my brother went to sleep while I went to my parent's bedroom and talked to them until 3.30 in the morning.  my mom finished crocheting my scarf!  and then they went to sleep while I came upstairs and reread the perilous gard.  which is a VERY good book, btw.  then it was like 5.30 and the sky was turning pink and I went to sleep.   thursday , new years day, I didn't get up until 12 because I slept so late.  and even then I was stumbling around all sleepy and everything.  my parents took me to the collin creek gap b/c of the lacy shirt thing I wanted, and I got one.  it's light pink with stripes!  and then I got another spaghetti strap thing cuz it was so cheap it'd be blasphemous not to buy it.  according to my mom, anyways.  it's not even my size (it's my mom's size... but we can basically wear each other's clothes so it doesn't matter much).  so yeah.  and then we went to dillard's and my mom and I both got a new pair of tennis shoes... they're exactly the same.  except for the size.  which are half a size apart.  (there was a 8.5 and a 9, and since my mom has slightly smaller feet than me, she got the 8.5 one and I got the 9.)  and they're marvelously lazy shoes and they're so cuuuute.  yup.  and then we stopped by mei hua and got some food... and at that time my parents decided to invite ppl to our house for new years!  and I freaked cuz I was like I DON'T WANT TO SEE TIAN GODDARNIT.  yeah.  but it turned out that they already got invited to another place, but jihai was gonna come, as well as these two little girls, so it meant I was free to stay in my room all evening as long as I said a "hi" when they first came.  so that's what I did.  I fell asleep rereading rebecca (heh) and so then my mom came to wake me up when kerry called.  and kerry called to ask me to go over to his house (wow, I did that a lot this break) cuz he was having another huge asian gathering thing.  so I went over.  (I ditched my parents' party for kerry's.  what a bad daughter I am.)  oh, the story behind the kerry's calling thing is this: my mom picked up the phone and kerry asked to speak to me.  my mom called me (she didn't know I was asleep) and then she hung up (after she asked him to come over to our house.. except he couldn't cuz he had to be the host or whatever of the younger kids).  cuz there were lots of ppl downstairs.  and I didn't pick up.  and then kerry called again and asked to speak to me again, and then my mom realized that I didn't pick up the first time.  yeah.  so anyhow, I went over sans my brother, and OH MY GOD there were OCEANS of ppl there.  yeah.  and kerry's mom saw me and was like, "Sunshine!  EAT!"  so she gave me a plate and put like thousands of pounds of food on there and I was like, "oookay then".  then to escape the questioning eyes (there were a lot), I went upstairs with the rest of the non-adults (they're not really kids... cuz lots of them were on break from college and if you're in college, you're not a kid) and watched friends and ate.  and watched little boys (elementary schol age) play DOA3 and exclaim over the "hot girls" and "I SAW HER UNDERWEAR!"  and such.  yeah.  there were like 20 non-adults and at least twice as many adults in that house.  it was pandemonium.  and then after a while, the middle-aged non-adults (aka me, rena, eileen, kerry, david) got bored and we went on AIM!  which was... funny.  cuz eileen signed on, then she went downstairs, and kerry and david and I took over her account...  hehehehehehehe.  and there was this girl she hated, stepho aka bringmepinkroses, and so kerry got onto zuiquandrunkard and started dissing her like heck.  "your mom's like a brick... she's short, fat, and gets laid by mexican workers"  yeah. stuff like that.  it was very interesting and VERY funny.  even though it was a bit mean.  and since he has deadaim, he could clone AIM, and so there were like 5 ppl on at once, and we were all talking to ppl and dissing them and such...  yeah.  it's not that funny unless you're there...  lol.  yeah.  rena is SOOOO freakishly thin.  goooosh.  and there was this boy, justin, age 10 or something, who WOULD NOT STOP TOUCHING MY HAIR.  it was the freakiest thing EVER.  (even worse than jeff chang...  ::shudder::).  yeah...  and I went home at midnight and talked to my parents some more and went to sleep.   friday , today, I woke up at 12.30 cuz my mom woke me up.  ate chicken soup and began blogging.  it's taking me like 1.5 hours to type this because my space bar is gone again so ALL the spaces you see are copy/pasted.  and it takes forever to paste every single space.  (my pinky hurts like freak.)  and now I'm gonna go to walmart to buy more yarn!  alright bye everyone!  freaky long entry...  see, I like blogging at blogger cuz only you two know the addy so I can actually write what I feel...  instead of at xanga where you hafta watch your every word.   though the feedback there is ego-boosting.  XDD  right.  bye now!  ++sunny

      yatta.  anyways.  to begin with.  after school!  lol.  no ranking until later, ppls.  XDD  sinfonia.  what can I say?   I'm not in first chair, though!!  yay!!!!!!  lol.  I had to tape the sinfonia 8 concert.  lol.  I was working w/a cd recorder!  it was so strange... like put in cd.  press rec mode.  press select.  press record.  press stop.  press rec mode.  press rec mode.  press select.  press record.  press stop.  press finalize.  hahahahaha.  I messed up a bit in the middle there cuz I couldn't remember all the keystrokes, but I got it all in the end.  only missed the first five seconds of the judge.  =D  not bad, considering they just pulled me in from outside and said, "are you a first/fifth pd psn who can press buttons?!"  LOL  now... to the fun stuff!  I was nervous as all heck and some more yesterday night.  I was sooooo so so so so dreading today it wasn't even conceivably funny.  NOT AT ALL FUNNY.  I was ranting my head off.  lol.  I actually went and drew pictures... for FUN.  ya... the horror!  drawing!  for FUN!  ya... see what art has done to me.  anyways.  hoped up to announcements today that we wouldn't get rankings.  too bad.  -___-;;  suffered through the entire first 30 minutes of algebra.  then... LUNCH.  I swear, I could NOT eat.  I really really could NOT.  ask kailing.  or deanna.  I was one nervous wreck.  I could not not not eat.  or focus.  or do anything.  then I made kailing wait until the end of lunch to go up with me to get our ranks.  we literally waited til like the last five minutes or so.  3, actually, cuz I made kailing wait for me while I ate an apple.  lol.  so we went up.  we were saying how su's table was gonna be looking at us...  lol.  and they were.  hahahaha.  so then we went up...  I went to my counselor who spent a long time looking for my name.  then when she finally handed me the papers, I was thinking, "two sheets?  for one rank?"  then I realised that it was actually a summary of every class I've taken for hs credit.  lol.  then I was like, "where's my rank?!"  and I saw it.  and I said, "oh my god."  and the counselor smiled at me and said, "can't ask for much better than that."  and then I thought, "haha, kailing is right behind me..."  but I said, "yeah!"  hahahaha.  then I grabbed kailing and began squealing like crazy.  I dragged her off the stage... literally.  she kept tripping b/c of her high heels.  hahaha!  and then on our crazy trek back to our lunch table, we ran into andrew tang who asked us our ranks... and all we said was, "we're both in top ten".  LOL.  then we got back to our table.  and I found out kailing's rank.  and we both squealed and "oh my god"ed some more.  hahahahaha.  man.  SO FREAKING HAPPY.  I am still high.  yeah.  I think kai and I were being v. loud.  lol.  then we made a pact to not tell anyone else our rankings!  suspense!  we don't want them to be able to list out top 10.  lol.  anyways.   we walked back from lunch, and I was telling kailing, "you know, this means that you beat  979  other people at this school!"  and she said, "oh my god you're right!"  hahaha.  then...!  algebra.  we went in and ppl asked, "what're your rankings?"  and we said, "we're both in top ten."  and the entire class went OMG and someone went YOU'RE FRESHMEN?!  LOL.  and then and then and then... we were high!  and I was even NICE to fan!  hahahah.  was the entire algebra class listening to our group today..?  hahahaha.  I think they were.  anyways.  then commapps.  w/stupid ppl. talking about being in the 800s.  I was surprised.  I had forgotten that there're actually ppl outside the 100s... it's like, for me, inside 100s there is light.  outside... no sense of it at all.  actually, I have no sense of where the GPAs are at different ranks.  just that mine is .004 from jack's.  argh.  and then after commapps, I packed up my backpack and talked to jack by his locker.  he told me he was rank four.  actually... I just asked for confirmation.  lol.  I could already tell from my gpa what his rank was.  yeah.. and I didn't tell him MY rank... so then he got mad at me.  like... yeah..  actually mad at me.  or disappointed, which very often is even WORSE than anger.   dilapidatedshack: :-D beD XTC: hm? beD XTC: why? dilapidatedshack: ranks!! dilapidatedshack: hahahahahahaha dilapidatedshack: hahahahahaha beD XTC: wats ur rank? dilapidatedshack: =D beD XTC: u better tell m,e...... beD XTC: since you know mine dilapidatedshack: you told me your GPA, dear beD XTC: I told you mine...not knowing that u would be so selfish.. dilapidatedshack: and since I knew what my gpa was beD XTC: are you 6? dilapidatedshack: it's not that hard figuring your rank out beD XTC: ? beD XTC: are you 6? beD XTC: oor 5? beD XTC: or 3? beD XTC: ...grrr... beD XTC: whgast wrong w/ you? dilapidatedshack: I need to go eat dilapidatedshack: =) dilapidatedshack: congrats, btw beD XTC: you know dilapidatedshack: =) beD XTC: I'll remember this beD XTC: ....... beD XTC: grrrr..... dilapidatedshack: I know you will dilapidatedshack: =) dilapidatedshack: I'm in top 10 dilapidatedshack: if that helps dilapidatedshack: =) beD XTC: see if you get my gpa again dilapidatedshack: lol dilapidatedshack: I will tell you... dilapidatedshack: eventually dilapidatedshack: =) beD XTC: tell me if ur higher or lower  beD XTC: no really... beD XTC: I'm not kidding.... beD XTC: tell me....... dilapidatedshack: can't dilapidatedshack: made a pact with kailing dilapidatedshack: =) beD XTC: ...... beD XTC: and so you know my rank because....I feel used dilapidatedshack: ... dilapidatedshack: I'm sorry, jack beD XTC: really now... beD XTC: at end of year... beD XTC: I swear dilapidatedshack: you swear what? beD XTC: ........you won't know anything about me unless you work w/ me... dilapidatedshack: -_________________- beD XTC: cuz...I really feel usedf beD XTC: ...... dilapidatedshack: gah beD XTC: go die... dilapidatedshack: I'm really really really really sorry dilapidatedshack: anyhow dilapidatedshack: brb beD XTC: ok...you know what?

I mean... by end of school day... amazing.  just amazing.  lol.  so far I've told kai, jack, meng, and dan my ranking.  =)  pretty sure chuan and dit know by now from our chatroom, but whatever.  hahahahaha.  so!  here's my guess at top ten.  1) the ever lovely ever illustrious beautiful heartthrob KAILING 2) grace yao* 3) louisa* 4) jack sun 5)  ME!  6) no earthly clue... 7) vishal 8) jeremy acc. to lisa 9) jeremy acc. to eliz 10) jack wang.  *not positive, but pretty sure 2 jacks in top ten.  kinda scary.  anyways.  dunno where jeremy is... but either 8 or 9.  lol.  so.  where's gabriel?  who can be sixth?  who wants to kill me?  =)  you know, I kept staring at my paper today.  I kept thinking they dropped a 1 in there or something... so I'm supposed to be 15 or something.  I mean... 5th?!  lol.  you know what's scary?  those ppl are all going to plano senior high.  top 5 TOTALLY surprised me.  not kailing, o'course, but I mean.. me and jack?  lol.  we were talking today, and I said, "you know... kailing and grace sound SO much smarter than jack and sunshine."  to which he replied pithily, "my name sounds so stupid."  to which  I  replied, "well, my name is  sunshine .  I mean, it sounds like my parents were on crack when the named me."  to which he just laughed.  and he also laughed when I told him my gpa was .004 below his.  hmm.  he's not v. nice.  lol.  he doesn't care what other ppl's ranks are.  only me and kailing and 2 and 3.  lol.  beD XTC: the first thing did asks.......what's ur rank dilapidatedshack: well dilapidatedshack: there's her personality for you dilapidatedshack: -___- dilapidatedshack: [can you tell I don't particularly like her?] dilapidatedshack: [ah, well] beD XTC: yes dilapidatedshack: do you like her? beD XTC: shes ok beD XTC: no didy's not telling me her rank beD XTC: -__________- dilapidatedshack: did you tell her yours? beD XTC: yep dilapidatedshack: give her your speech beD XTC: somewhere around 30 dilapidatedshack: it made me feel guilty as freaking heck beD XTC: it wont work on her dilapidatedshack: why? beD XTC: and only beD XTC: cuz beD XTC: ur a good friend and you actually feel guilty beD XTC: and actualyl...I dont really really care what her rank is...  haha.  how sweet.  LOL.  and he's also mad at esther's 22... which I just found funny b/c he's FOURTH.  then I talked to jimmy ma!  he's so cool.  =)  he's in kansas, though... and he's ranked 1 at his school.  lol.  but there're only like 300 ppl in his grade... and I was like WHOA.  and he said that his entire school of four grades only has 1500 ppl.  and I was like WHOA.  yeah.  he's cool.  he used to live on my street!  and so that was my day.

      okay, so on sunday.  I got up and got online.  chuan talked to me!  said that I was supposed to go over at 1.  so I did!  but I was 10 minutes late cuz of my parents.  *sigh*  ah, well.  it was only me and kailing... but according to him, we were loud as heck.  hahahaha.  and I was very hungry.  =D  and I ate all his blue raspberry jolly ranchers.  those things are gooooood, man.  so we worked.  a bit.  well, more than we did before, anyways.  lol.  which isn't really saying a lot...  -__-;;  so that was that.  then we talked to jack online and got him to go over at 6.  I left at around 7.  hahahahaha.  we really didn't get much done.  all I really remember is sitting at his computer and typing away.  either at script or on aim.  lol.  wow.  sunday was kinda anticlimatic...  -__-;;  so then I came home and finished up all my leftover weekend homework.  I was so dreading school on tuesday because of biology grades... then I found out we got a 103!  so I'm happy as a beaver right now.  =D  and on monday night, my parents dragged me to open house even though I was supposed to be at an orchestra rehearsal....  hahahaha.  but I told bartley about it beforehand, so it should be all good.  =)  note:  going to open house is useless if you're not failing.  I'm serious.  I went to talk to humanities teachers.  wait in line for ten minutes.  my parents get up there and stanford say to them: "sunshine's doing fine.  nice job."  and move on.  then to algebra!  walker's talking to someone's dad for like 5 minutes on how the daughter needs to improve and such... then she says to my parents "sunshine's a marvelous math student.  no complaints.  her class loves her."  (actually, they USE me, darnit.  not v. cool at all.)  then didn't want them to talk to plasterr... so went to lux.  she just said "she's doing fine".  then on to biology.  kite was talking to this guy for like HOURS... about not taking too many honors classes and attending tutorials and such... and then she says to my parents, "sunshine is a great student.  she does her best on everything and everything is always above and beyond."  then my mom asks her if she needs to push me.  and kite says "no, she's very self-motivated.  from what I can see, she does everything well because she wants to."  and it felt v. weird being there and hearing her compliment me when she ususally ignores me in class.  -_____-;;  yaaa.....  then art.  said I show lots of potential, yadda.  french.  stip not there.  whoohoo.  so basically... open house = big waste of time.  except for when my parents were talking to jack's parents.  then it was a bit strange.  both his parents are so freaking SHORT.  anyways.  got home.  got online.  fooled around.  yadda.  got 98 on speech that I didn't practice at all!  felt v. proud of self.  lisa got a 85 and jack a 82.  o__O;;  dunno how they did that...  this person sitting next to me just went up there and MADE UP a speech and got a 84... TOTALLY ad-libbed it.  and he's one of those bad ppl, too.  the bald guy.  -__-;;  and natalie cordell went up there and made up her speech, too.  she has an autistic brother and she started crying in the middle of her speech...  then she sat down and said she felt like crap [crap is an euphimism...  -_-;;] b/c she did speed that morning.  -_________-;;  am highly worried.  then the bald guy actually TALKED to me... I nearly had a heart attack.  he said I was "very quiet".  HAHHAHAHAHAA.  *coff*  and so ends my lovely life.  kinda.  lol.  english test was FREAKING HARD.  *sigh*  ++sunny

      whoohoo.  okay.  weekend began on friday at 4.15 exactly for me.  =)  or at least this one did.  so chuan, kai, and I hopped onto didy's bus and headed to her house.  while we were waiting for the bus to get going, chuan and I saw jack walking around the student parking lot looking for his dad.  he was wearing this hideously bright yellow jacket... JACKet... lol.  okay, yeah. -_-;;  so chuan and I were spying on him, and then we got the idea that wouldn't it be so cool if we got to didy's house before he did?  you know, public transportation beating private transportation?  awesome, ain't it?  so then I got  really  hooked onto that idea.  I mean,  REALLLY  hooked onto it.  So I made chuan look out the window into the cars passing us to see if any of them were jack.  and they weren't.  so it was like that the entire drive to didy's stop, which, luckily, was first!  so we got off, and I was hyper as freaking heck.  I wanted to  beat jack , darnit!  so I started running around.  except I didn't know where to go.  so I kept running in the wrong direction.  but luckily, I got into the right alleyway.  yay!  but then I was running so funnily and so boucily that my backpack got jostled open and all my stuff spilled out.  right in the middle of the alleyway.  and then I totally lost it.  totally.  in the middle of the freaking alleyway with all my stuff spilled out in a circle around me.  I just sat down and laughed and laughed and laughed.  and kailing and didy had to pick up all my stuff for me.  man.  then I went into didy's house from the back and AMAZINGLY... jack wasn't there yet!  then chuan went and looked out the front cuz he thought he heard a car and lo and behold!  there was jack!  and then he came in and I lost it all over again.  actually, I hadn't quite found it after losing it the first time yet... lol.  it was funny.  then we were supposed to work on script.  but we kinda got into a huge pingpong match.  it was usually didy and me against jack and chuan or jack and kevin.  then I played jack by myself.  it was lots of fun.  not much script getting done, though.  but at all times, there was at least one person working on script.  so that was good, I guess.  kailing has this huge thing against camera phones.  which made taking pictures of her that much more fun.  lol.  poor her.  anyways.  so we all got into didy's room and messed around.  didy's bed is freakishly bad.  and then there was much spraying of perfume.  then more pingpong!  yaya.  it was v. fun.  then my mom picked me up and we ate out.  then we went to gap!  and spent $60 there buying $75 worth of stuff.  b/c it was a spend $75 get $15 off thing.  lol.  yeah...  it was mostly stuff for my mom and brother, though.  =)  b/c I am not vain like that.  my brother got these cool pants that had like 17 pockets on it... it was sooo cool.  I mean, literally, 17 pockets.  it was like cargo pants, except one of the pockets on one side was like an organizer thing... you could open it and there were those pencil loop things and little pouches and zippers and a keychain thing.  I had fun opening and closing those things.  aaaanyways.  so that was my friday.  I came home and started reading a book for FUN.  I went to sleep at 5 in the morning.  I got up at 11 to eat then went back to sleep on saturday.  it was snowing!  then kailing called me at 1 and told me ppl were coming at 1.30... so I hurried up and got up.  then kai came at 1.3o and we went out and built a snow hippo!  =D  it was mucho fun.  and then jack came and he insulted our hippo.  then we went in and then didy and chuan came.  they played a lot of ssb while kai and I typed away t the script.  we actually did a lot of work!  then we took a break and went ouside to play in the snow.  the v. rare snow that's all gone now.  =(  we went to the bike trail and had the BEST snowball fight EVER.  it was boys against girls... but then kai just stood there and didy was v. wimpy.  she was either running away from chuan and jack or just standing there looking.  and I was the only one who was actually hitting them.  and I shoved show down both their shirts.  =D  cuz they kept hitting kailing who wouldn't hit back b/c of the dirty snow.  psh.  and i was only wearing one of my sleepy shirts and a thin jacket.  with no gloves.  while my brother and jack both had gloves and jack had this whole snow suit thing.  it wasn't fair.  but I got them good, man.  got them good.  =D  I made a snow heart for kailing, but she wouldn't be my valentine!  so didy was my valentine.  =(  then the boys kept hitting me in the head and I ate so much dirty snow it wasn't funny.  jack kept apologizing for hitting me, which took a lot of fun out of that.  man.  anyways.  then they got tired of it and wanted to go in.  I wanted to fight some more.  but alas... no.  *sigh*  so then inside.  changed.  more ssb.  kai and chuan and I hung out in my room then went down for hot chocolate.  then didy and jack came down for some.  then we started discussing plot ending.  we got one!  kai had to go home, though.... but the rest ended up staying for dinner.  my dad recorded them eating and then he and my mom watched the video of them eating.  jack was watching, then he stopped when it was just him watching himself eat.  lol.  it was funny.  then upstairs again.  chuan and I were working on script.  jack and didy playing ssb still.  then didy worked on script with me.  chuan and jack play ssb.  then they finally stopped playing ssb and all crowded around me.  i got claustrophobic.  jack then started asking us about his body language.  and here was the whole sinister grin thing.  it was funny as freaking heck.  he cannot manage a sinister grin for the life of him.  just a sort of happy grimace thing.  lol.  so then chuan got onto the other computer and got online.  online=AIM.  and then he and jack were talking to jeff while didy and I were working.  it was valentine's day....  so.... yeah.  lots of interesting things.  the threesome thing came from me asking jeff on chuan's sn if he wanted to be chuan's valentine.  he said no.  then I asked if he would be didy's.  he dotdotdotted.  then jack said "chuan and didy     it's a threesome", meaning jeff, chuan, and didy all valentines of each other.  lol.  and that got into jeff's profile.  didy wanted him to take it off, jack wanted him to keep it on, chuan and I were just laughing.  then back to script.  more typing.  then I played speed online while jack chuan didy were doing some strange thing on my brother's computer.  man. no more script after that.  they finally all left at around 10.30.  9 hours after kai first showed up.  maaaan.  then I got online and chatted.  then I went to sleep at 2 cuz I was reading again.  lol.  this morning got up at 11.30 and was sad about lack of snow.  then ate a bit, got online, and worked until 1 when I went over to chuan's.  okay.  rest of sunday coming later.  it's 12.30 and I gotta go practice my speech some.  byebye.  ++sunny

      i swear, i could not find a pair more annoying than them in the whole wide world if i tried.  they are the epitome of annoying.  and i hate them both with a passion.  jack is so funny and sweet sometimes.  and he is so confused most of the time that it's not even funny.  i really really really hate didy and jeff.  LIFE turning circles peripherally floating out of grasp so close! fluttering, floating, straining... pop!.  isn't that a lovely inpromptu poem?  no, it's not, and i hate life with a passion right now.  i am about to kill some people.  i want to just go to school and come home and bomb all my tests and sleep for twenty hours and not think of anything at all.  i want to be in love with a normal, nice person and not have to think about the real world at all.  and then i'll kill him.  i want for jack to be a barber and cut hair and for all of us to go to a barbershop and commune and it would be like the butterflies and we'd be free and happy and lovely.  i hate didy and jeff.  i want to eat until i blow up.  i want to throw up anger.  i want to murder and then get murdered.  ++sunny

       YEEEEEEEES NO MORE BIOLOGY!!   *cough*  and for the first time almost a week, sunshine has time to get online and update her blog!!  =D  oh, on the car today, I was talking to my mom about jack and how freaky he was at the piano and everything (while we were taking kailing home), and it was freeaaaaky.  I really really really wanna go over now.  =)  but the thing is... just randomly going over to jack's house is not the same thing as just randomly going over to kailing's house.  -__-;;  (maybe because jack's not kailing!  lol yeah anyways...)  but I dunno how they're gonna fit people into his house.... it's freaky small.  maybe he's gonna move to frisco or something.  =)  then he wouldn't be around to depress me.  oh, while I was talking to my mom, she was like, "there's nothing between you and jack, right?"  and I went "umm.... noooo way..." and she went "just making sure.  I mean, you're a girl and he's a guy, and I always leave you two alone in the house together..."  and I went "gee you make it sound so bad."  and then she like gave a lecture about sex without ever using that word... haha.  and how not to "try it out" with jack or whatever.  and I was sweatdropping like crazy.  it was v. v. v. strange conversation.  -______-;;  and then I was thankful she's never heard one of ning's conversations with me.  lol.  that would not have gone over too well...  and then we talked more about jack... and more about jack... and it was strange.  and she told me again that jack dragged his parents to willow bend mall to "look at sunshine's drawing".  and according to her, he told his parents that he was glad they never wasted their money on teaching him how to draw b/c he could never had turned out anything like whatever crap I had exhibited there.  (dun remember what it was, just remember I hated the stupid picture)  hahahahahha.  -__-  he's not normal.  I swear.  not like, gay, or anything, but not normal.  and he was born with perfect pitch, man, BORN WITH IT.  I am so mad at him.  go move to frisco, little boy!  aaaand I was looking through this backpack one day and I saw this note from this tracey girl in canada... and he said for me to not open it (cuz I was opening everything else of his.  I looked at all his progress reports.  lol.).  and then he said it was because he didn't even read it yet.  and he got it before he moved to plano in august.  and I was like "o0;;;;"  and then I made a mental note to never write jack anything because it will just be a waste of time, energy, and paper on my part.  =)  and now I'm gonna go eat then tackle my homework then GET MORE THAN 5 HOURS OF SLEEP TONIGHT.  =D  ++sunny

       THANK YOU ALL SO SO SO SO SO MUCH.   =D  I lurve it beyond all else.  but I'm scared to wear it to school... I'm gonna be smelling my shirt all day!  eep.  well, I can't wear it tomorrow cuz I have two somewhat major tests...  my day in a nutshell:  got to school, jackie gave me insanely pink insanely cute pillow.  =D  then I studied like crazy for bio quiz.  cuz I missed a day.  whoo.  then I went to locker, and on the way to orchestra, gracey apprehended me and gave me a tiger bobble head!  it's so cute.  =D  then orchestra.  scale test.  two octave F major.  cuz everyone else peeked into the hat and took the B flat majors.  skew them.  even deanna peeked!  I'm the only honest one there.  ;)  then bio.  lisa and charles... man.  in the middle of mrs kite's lecture, they start whispering madly and giggling.  then they turn to look at me and giggle some more.  I'm like o__O;; and they giggle some more.  then lisa says, "charles just told me that if you and jack get married, you'd be sunshine sun!"  and I think, "holy crap.  what the heck?"  and then lisa says, "I'm gonna tell jack about this!" and I think, "he already knows... -__-"  maaaaan.  that's disturbing.  then art!  we worked on our armatures.  I'm doing a geisha!  hehe.  but she's turning out... blobby.  haha.  it's disturbing doing this project cuz we hafta make the people, you know, so it's like... we shape their heads and upper torso all out of newspaper.  so when you're doing a girl and you're shaping the breasts... it's... disturbing.  cuz then if they don't look right, you have to tweak them around and then you have to mold them to get them to look not-so-spherical and more conish... man.  it was a disturbing art period.  then french.  who ever does anything in french? I just sat there and doodled and talked more to lisa.  and stacey.  and then I just sat and stared some more.  haha.  what fun.  now I gotta go study for algebra and humanities.  and read ge.  and copy some notes for jack.

      what a freaking crappy birthday.  I got up today at 9:30 b/c chuan called me asking where I was.  I thought we were meeting at 10!!  so then I got up... dressed... ate... and got there at 10:30 anyways.  then we filmed.  and filmed.  and filmed.  then I went to jack's house and his dad cooked us hamburgers.  whoo.  then he played fishy and I watched him.  and he burned me a copy of his pokemon CD.  sadly enough, that was my one present today.  -___-  then we [jack and me] went to lisa's house.  we picked flowers for like... 45 minutes.  then jack and I played pingpong.  then we watched TOTORO!!  and i was so happy.  totoro is so cute!  I want a totoro of my own.  =(  but it was in japanese with chinese subtitles... so we just kinda watched the pictures.  and we pressed our flowers.  and then jack and lisa played with my hair.  and then we tried to paint jack's nails, but it didn't work.  so we painted his arm instead.  whoo.  and then we left lisa's house!  and I went to math.  where I was freaking dead.   then we went to didy's house and continued filming.  and filming.  and filming.  WE'RE MORE THAN 1/2WAY THROUGH WITH OUR MOVIE...!!  whoohoo!  and then I came home at 10.30.  12.5 hours after I left home.  man.  and tomorrow [today by now] I'm going to jack's house at 9 and filming til 11.30.  then chinese school.  then more filming.  then homework.  man.... I hate the weekend!!  oh, and lisa's coming over tomorrow.  whoohoo.  and I didn't see my parents at all today.  well... I did.  for like 20 minutes in all.  =(  and I didn't get cake!  and I didn't get any sort of celebration at all.  =(

      aaaaaaaah TODAY WAS NOT FUN AT ALL.  oh my freaking GOD.  MY THIRD PERIOD CLASS IS COMMAPPS.  MRS PLASTERR DOESN'T LET OUR CLASS OUT OF A 10 FEET RADIUS OF HER.  WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO TALK TO STUDENTS FROM OTHER CLASSES.  SHE INSISTS ON TALKING TO ME BECAUSE I AM "TOO QUIET".  OH MY FREAKING GOD.  but the cool thing was... fourth period, mrs lux wasn't there!  and she didn't have a substitute, either!  so we literally just partied for the first 50 minutes of class.  literally.  people were break dancing and whenever we wanted to get something, we just took the pass and left.  it was awesome.  and nobody came and checked up on us, either!  and then it turned out that mrs lux was at a meeting and a teacher was supposed to come... but then mrs lux came back and she was mad at the administrators and she felt that our "precious learning time" had been wasted, so she gave us the rest of the period to do whatever we wanted!  and she gave us each a handful of skittles.  =)  it was freaking awesome.  now.  about jack.  Exhibit A: convo with meng!  meng4meng: hihi! dilapidatedshack: AAAAAAAAAAH I'M GONNA KILL NING dilapidatedshack: AND TIANTIAN dilapidatedshack: grr meng4meng: why? dilapidatedshack: but that's okay dilapidatedshack: =) meng4meng: i do hope it had nothing to do with what happened during 3rd period dilapidatedshack: ahahaha dilapidatedshack: chuan comes up to me after school dilapidatedshack: "sunshine!  jack said he'd go out with you!" dilapidatedshack: me dilapidatedshack: "need to get to locker need to get to lock--- what?" meng4meng: go read my blog! dilapidatedshack: "jack said he'd go out with you!" meng4meng: it has some more details on what happned meng4meng: :-) dilapidatedshack: "okay... no." dilapidatedshack: "no?!" dilapidatedshack: "no." dilapidatedshack: "yes?" dilapidatedshack: "no." dilapidatedshack: "aww, the second person you've rejected in 2 days!" dilapidatedshack: "I know"  btw, the first person I "rejected" was chuan.  he asked me to marry him so he could have sex with me.  yeah.  not the way to go about doing that, chuan.  Exhibit B: convo with chuan!  AznDuffboy: oh that AznDuffboy: lol AznDuffboy: ok... AznDuffboy: like during that thingyfire/water thingy AznDuffboy: tiantian was like... weird w/ kai and meng AznDuffboy: and ning AznDuffboy: and she came over to me, alex, felix, and jack AznDuffboy: and asked jack, "would you like to go out w/ kailing"? AznDuffboy: and he said "no..." AznDuffboy: then i told him to say "yes" next time to humor them AznDuffboy: so bing convinced tiantian to ask again AznDuffboy: and jack said "yes" AznDuffboy: and then tiantian went back to their group all happy & such AznDuffboy: and then kailing dumped jack like 1 minute later when she found out AznDuffboy: so then she asked if jack would like to go out w/ you AznDuffboy: and he also said "yes" AznDuffboy: and...yea AznDuffboy: that's it  ha!  he was just humoring you sad sad people.  ha!  Exhibit C: convo with jack!  dilapidatedshack: you know what? beD XTC: hm? dilapidatedshack: I was so terribly bored today that even IRENE was welcome company beD XTC: wow dilapidatedshack: gaaaaaah IT WAS TORTURE beD XTC: haha beD XTC: it was so fun beD XTC: wow it was fun dilapidatedshack: I was just sitting there in the grass dilapidatedshack: counting the stalks of grass in a square inch dilapidatedshack: and then mrs plasterr is like, "sunshine, come over here and talk to jason" dilapidatedshack: and I'm like dilapidatedshack: I don't waaaaant to dilapidatedshack: I want to sit here and count grass, darnit beD XTC: what? beD XTC: why does she want you to talk to jason beD XTC: wtf beD XTC: haha dilapidatedshack: it was so horrible dilapidatedshack: I was just counting seconds... dilapidatedshack: and then I thought dilapidatedshack: aw, man, kailing and ning and lisa and jack are all on the other side of the school having fun beD XTC: hahaha dilapidatedshack: what was chuan saying to you today? beD XTC: what did he say? beD XTC: I dont remembe dilapidatedshack: something about being shot down? dilapidatedshack: I was confused beD XTC: dont remember dilapidatedshack: hmm dilapidatedshack: I'll go ask chuan! dilapidatedshack: huh dilapidatedshack: disregard anything ning ever says to you regarding me dilapidatedshack: b/c it's probably false beD XTC: what? beD XTC: they were humoring beD XTC: they just did it because they were so horribly bored beD XTC: and had nothing else to do dilapidatedshack: haha dilapidatedshack: they humored you or you humored them? beD XTC: I humored them  SO HA!  there.  a case in three exhibits.  =)  aaaand... I   beD XTC: you know what? dilapidatedshack: ? beD XTC: I think melanie's not very nice beD XTC: shes dry  hahahahaha THIS IS THE FIRST GUY I KNOW WHO DOES NOT LIKE MELANIE.  aaaaaah I   hmm.  well.  that sentence just kinda defeated the purpose of those nice exhibits...  man.  but anyways!  chuan does not like didy.  I asked him, and he said no.  I hope he doesn't like me.  that would just be awkward.  but he said, "remember, sunshine... you are my bestest buddy in the whole wide world..."  and I was like o__O  that doesn't sound good...  I   why does everyone think I like jack??  T___T  I dooooon't like jack.  why doesn't anyone think jack likes meee?  then I wouldn't feel so strange.   ...actually... I would.  haha!  anyway.  I have AIME tomorrow!!  wish me luck!!!!  I talked to mrs kite about it, and she was like "sunshine, you're going to fail."  she was kidding.  then she said, "you're missing a lab... but that's okay, because you and amy work so well together"  and then I thought of meng! and I was like, "can I skip 8th pd french to do the lab... pleeeaaase?"  and she said no.  =(  wheeeee.  TALK TO ME ABOUT JACK, PEOPLE.  I'M IN AN OBSESSION RELAPSE HERE.  IT'S ALL THESE PROJECTS WE'RE DOING TOGETHER, I SWEAR.

Willow bend mall is awesome... no pollen in it at all.  after school today, we were filming, and I almost DIED.  my eyes were KILLING me.  I seriously could not open my eyes because of all the pollen.  I had to wet them every few minutes just to get them to work... egads.  it was not fun.  march is not a very fun month for me.  me: mom, my allergies are bothering me. mom: let's go see a doctor. me: why don't you just go ask jack's mom? mom: why don't you just get to her clinic and become her patient? me: you know, I do believe my allergies are getting better; we don't have to go! mom: I'll ask jack's mom. me: yay. mom: I still think you should become her patient. me: NO WAY. mom: but it's mean to keep taking advantage of her like this. me: I know. mom: you should become her patient. me: but MOM, she's JACK SUN'S MOM. mom: so? me: JACK SUN'S MOM. mom: so? me: he's gonnna know EVERY LITTLE THING WRONG WITH ME.  cuz she's gonna TELL HIM.  cuz she's JACK SUN'S MOM. mom: so? me: that's nooooot goooooood.

I do believe I'm beginning to sound like kailing.  how scary!  not that it's bad or anything.  but scary nonetheless.  skanky!  I like that word.  b/c it sounds cool.  too bad it's not a very good word.  I HAVE TO REMEMBER TO BRING MY EYEYDROPS TO LISA'S TOMORROW, OR ELSE I WILL DIIIIIIIE.  good night, all!

      yeah, I know, I haven't updated since the middle ages...  but it's high school, so what do you expect?  [more, I know, but shh!]  anyways.  it's been a dismal week for me... I have a freaking 98 in algebra because of HOMEWORK.  that is the STUPIDEST thing to get dragged down by.  sheesh.  not that I should be complaing about a 98.  cuz all my other averages are... way down there.  haha.  -___-  we've done almost nothing in these three weeks...  yeesh.  anyway.  what have I been doing?  I've been sleeping like heck.  I love sleeping.  Id wants to sleep.  Ego tells me to go to bed.  I wanna kill superego.  Id and ego both want to kill superego.  anyway, I've just been gadding about reading fanfics all week.  so now I have an art proj due tomorrow that I still have to work on.  and I'm just thinking about how much I'd love to use jack's prismacolor pencils to color it.  why does HE get the prismacolors when he doesn't even LIKE art?  I gotta go do... some stuff now.  =)  so buh bye.  maybe I'll write a super long post later tonight.  but don't count on it.  unless kailing bugs me to do it BEFORE 11.30...  cuz she keeps going, "sunshine, I think you should update your blog" at ELEVEN THIRTY.  and then she goes to sleep!  I mean... wth?!

       kailingy: hum kailingy: one would think that one would get tired of talking about jack kailingy: but it's so weird kailingy: one does not cease of things to talk about dilapidatedshack: that's cuz I'm obsessed dilapidatedshack: haha dilapidatedshack: well dilapidatedshack: less so than I was in say dilapidatedshack: third six weeks dilapidatedshack: then I could talk for hours on end about him   HOHOHO.  let's see if I can actually do that!  except now it'd have to be for paragraphs on end... haha.  so.  I'll keep writing about him until 11.55, which is about 15 minutes from now.  oh dot em dot gee dot, man.  he is so freaking good at the piano that it's not even conceivably funny.  I mean, his fingers are so freaking freaking freaking SKINNY and they look so knobbly and bony and and and and and and and it's like... THIN, and you get the impression that he's not all that strong, but then when he sits down at the piano and starts playing, it's like O.M.G.  they move so freaking FAST and they're ALL OVER THE PLACE and they go here and there and here and there again and cross over and and and they NEVER MISS A BEAT.  I mean, he was just playing for like ten minutes and I was just standing there looking at his fingers and his music and I was like, "holy crap.  I don't think he's missing a single freaking beat."  which is just CRAZY, cuz the song is THIRTY-FREAKING-NINE PAGES LONG!    and I was turning pages for him, and I was like O____________O.  and I kept not knowing when to turn cuz I was like... man.  I know it's soon.  I know where he is.  but does he have this memorized?   then I thought.  man.  he's got this whole freaking PIECE memorized!  and he's only played it for ONE MONTH.  hoooooooly crap.  he can find the time to practice piano AND still be ranked fourth.  and then I think, "I'm probably gonna be ranked higher than him next semester..."  but then I feel GUILTY for thinking that.  I have NO FREAKING CLUE WHY, but I do.  it's so freaky!  I don't want to feel bad for beating someone!  then I'll be dreading ranks... again!!!  and then my mom keeps talking to his mom... and then last night his mom told my mom something about her family, so now I'm like on eggshells around her, cuz it's like... strange.  and I can't elaborate any more than that without giving it away.  man.  he can't go back to china!  =(  I wanted to come back from china with his family.  hahaha.  man.  now I don't know what I'm gonna do come end of may.  cuz I can't fly solo, so I hafta tag along with a family.  well, not really tag along, persay, but be on the saem flight as a family.  So I don't "get lost at the airports".  yeah, right.  with my legendary skills?  no way!  haha.  I just realized I still gotta pack my backpack for bio tutorials tomorrow morning!  crap.  so I gotta cut this thing short.  and I didn't get to type that much cuz I was talking to didy!  =((((  she's depressed about jack.  lol.  remember a while back when I kept calling you guys and complaining about how much I was depressed by jack?  well, she's in that stage right now.  so I'm laughing at her!  hahahaha.  okay then.  buh bye.  I wonder if you guys will really read all that.  haahhaa.  I'll type more about him later.  tomorrow!  hehehe.

I don't like it.  at all.  which is why I spent a good part of the time in the creek hovering around jack.  to get away from chuan.  grr.  man.  I've still got hot zone to do.  oh, well.  I can't get used to the fact that school is TOMORROW, for heaven's sakes.  which means I oughta get to sleep soon.  SOON.  yeah.

      I'm so freaking tired right now that it's not even funny.  anyways.  let's start at noon!  where my other entry today left off.  so I went downstairs and microwaved and cooked food for my brother.   so we would have a VARIETY.  -gasp~!- and then we ate.  and then I got online and talked around with t00by ppl and shtuff like that.  then meng called and asked to come over!  [actually, her bro called... but same thing]  and I really really really really really really really wanted them to come over and play!  b/c I haven't seen meng-dahlin for the longest longest longest time!  and so I was sad like =(((((((((((((((.  and then jack FINALLY dragged his lazy butt online and told me to go over at three and leave at six.  ha!  what a joke.  anyways.  so it was still like 12:30 at that time.  so I decided to be PRODUCTIVE and I fiddled around with the script some.  and then I decided to make my OWN wildflower book cuz I'm too asian-cheap to go buy a copy of it.  so I was working and working and working [and not even reading a fic!] until I saw that it was 1:20!  so I had to hurry up and get dressed and brush my hair and yadda yadda.  then I get going.  oooooh boy.  NOT smart.  so I start out.  I wear my  blue shoes.  not v. smart.  anyways.  I have this PHOBIA of crossing streets at intersections... so.... yeah.  I had to MAKE SURE I didn't cross a street at an interection.  so I started out on hedgecoxe, crossed it, and then was about to cross coit, but then I saw an INTERSECTION.  so I said, "nah." and turned the corner onto coit.  then in the middle of the way btwn hedgecoxe and legacy, there was a lull in the traffic, and I crossed.  then cut across the tom thumb parking lot w/lotsa ppl looking at me funny.  then I fretted the entire walk from coit to independence about how I was gonna get across legacy.  -_____-;;  then I finally got across and cut across albertson's parking lot.  more ppl looking at me funny.  [teenager walking with a backpack during spring break?!  inconceivable!]  then I had to figure out how to cross independence...  and I did.  =)  and then I GOT LOST.  I GOT SO FREAKING LOST IT WASN'T EVEN FUNNY.  so I called kailing... not home.  called meng... not home.  called chuan... not home.  called ning... not home.  NO ONE COULD GET ONLINE AND TELL ME WHERE TO GO.  so I just wandered around for a while dumbly... then I somehow found my way.  whoohoo~  [dun ask why I didn't call jack.  cuz I dunno why.]  so then I got there at three!  right on time.  =)  and then he printed out the "book" that I sent him... haha.  and then we had to go to walmart and buy a memo pad... for 83 cents!  whoohoo.  then finally at 3:30, we went outside and started looking for flowers.  we walked along the bike trail by the creek for a while... and we found lots and lots of henbit.  lots.  and we dug some up and flattened it.  not very well, imho, but whatever.  and then we dug up some other random flowers.  and then we explored the creek!  and there were FISH in the creek... amazing, ne?  and there was WILD ONION.  like... just GROWING there.  and so jack picked up a few stalks and brought them home.  then we went back at 5.30.  then I pestered him some and he said he's show me his room.  yay!  so I saw his room.  he has this painting hanging up of a forest... and I laughed my head off over it.  it was so freaking funny.  yeah.  and I looking around and made him feel nervous, I think, because he kept looking at me.  and then his mom came home made me eat a popsicle.  and then she gave me these bunches of pens... cuz my mom told her that I like pens...?  O__ô  and then she gave me bunches of sticky notes...  and then she looked at my face... and touched it... and it was all very strange.  and then she touched the bump on my head and looked at my skin [cuz obviously my mom talked to her about my face?  my skin?  my bumps?]... and then she told me that she didn't want to talk about it with jack present... so it was all very very strange.  then jack was like, "I saw these really pretty blue flowers over thataway; wanna go walk again?"  and so me being the stupid person I am [and also b/c I wanted away from his mother], I said yes.  so we started out all over again.  "to collect flowers", you see.  but of course that didn't happen.  so we wandered and meandered around and he showed me the plano dog park.  then we walked some more along his creek.  we walked all the way past schimelpfenig library...  and then there was this part where he said he liked to go to skip rocks, so we went down there by the creek.  and I decided to go wading in the creek... and then it was slippery and mossy and algaey and so of course I slipped and fell in.  -_____-  and it was getting dark by then and I was freaking COLD.  I mean... COLD.  and then I tried to catch some ducks that were in the water... and of course I didn't catch them.  and then I went wading around some more.  then jack told me I'd better get out.  so I made him bring me my shoes and I got out.  hahahaha.  then we went walking along some more.  and we went exploring in all these little places... and it was so much fun!  then when we got to the pasture place... we found out that the city of Plano, in its efforts to "Keep Plano Beautiful", have MOWED THE ENTIRE PLACE!  so so so... all the flowers = GONE!!  and then we were sad/mad like >=(((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((.  and then by that time it was like... 6.30 and rapidly getting darker.  so we decided to start walking back.  [cuz we're both just so smart like that.]  I swear... on the way back, he said, "it's getting dark" TEN TIMES.  at least.  and we talked about the creek flooding and random stuff like that.  and then we finally got back to his house at 7 and my mom was already for an hour just talking to his parents... yeah.  first thing when jack walks in... mom: congratulations, jack! jack: ö__ó me: what're you congratulating him for? mom:  his rank, of course!  i haven't congratulated him yet. me: ö__ó jack: thank you.  and then my mom dragged me home.  oh!  and when we got back to his house, jack's mom gave me another popsicle.  -___-;;  see, jack can refuse his mom, but I can't.  -sigh- or else it won't be polite.  -sigh-  so then I went home and ate dumplings.  and now I'm tired as all hell and I want to sleep.  so I shall.  okidoki.  byebye.  p.s. movie times scheduling is a freaking pain in the butt.

      spring break is turning out to be the most tiring week of my life thus far.  doesn't that kind of defeat the purpose of spring BREAK?  I mean... really.  these stupid teachers.  anyways, there's really no point to this post.  I'm just tired.  and tired.  yeah.  and now I gotta go cook for my brother so I can go walk somewhere again today.  I'm walking everywhere this week.  this freaking sucks.  ++sunny

      My mom has the strangest notions about me and my friends.  She, for some unknown, unfathomable reason, thinks that all my friends have ulterior motives behind everything they do.  Especially guy friends.  And by guy friends, I basically mean Jack, because unless I have worked with a guy on a project with only us two in a group, she does not consider him a friend.  So Kerry would be in this category, too, and everyone else is just... out there.  Anyways.  So every day when I go do something, I have to give her a full report on it when I get back.  And she asks about every single little thing.  It's kind of funny, actually, I suppose.  Even though now she's not so hung up on Kailing and Meng and Jackie.  Because I just go over too often.  But, because she's shifted her attention off of them, she's kind of honed in on Jack.  I feel sorry for him, actually.  Every time he comes over to do something, she asks him about music.  For example: Mom: What do you think of Glenn Gould? Jack: Glenn Gould?  Of course I like him.  He's Canadian. Mom: You like Canadians? Jack: Yes.  I am Canadian. And then they get onto a whole new strange discussion about stuff.  And I'm just sitting at the dinner table eating nonchalantly and trying to will my mom to shut up.  And this happens EVERY SINGLE TIME he eats over.  Which is actually pretty often...  And she's got this strange Chinese mediveal thinking that the guy has to be the person that asks the girl to do anything.  Like for our Hidden Evidence project, she had to ask if it was him that asked me or me that asked him.  And when I told her that it was him that asked me, she went, "Good."  And this time, for the wildflower thing, I just said, "We were just kind of... together."  To which she said, "You're not going out, are you?"  And I just sighed and shook my head.  The wildflower thing WAS kind of strange.  We just somehow got to work together.  Lisa asked me if I was working with Jack in biology one day, and I just nodded my head.  I wasn't even sure if I was working with him yet, but then we started talking about it and I suppose we just kind of assumed we were working together.  I really cannot imagine doing a group project that does NOT have him in it, actually.  And so, there we go.  I just wanted to get that out.  Can you tell by my voice and diction and sentence structure that I'm feeling a bit off?  ++sunny

      anyways.  basically no point in this post but to post... so... whatever.  did almost nothing today.  was a very dismal day in humanties for me.  got a multitude of Bs.  it was not fun.  then went to math... sunshine songs.  and test.  that I'm not so sure about anymore (mostly cuz I can't remember what the problems were...).  then I saw the ppl who made the AIME!  There's a "Xuang Zhou" whom I'm not sure is me or not.  -____-;;  so..  gotta go ask mrs walker about that tomorrow!  whoohoo.  I hope it is me... then I can rub it in chuan's face (even though he made it, too.)  AND there's a freaking TXML thing tomorrow after school...  so I'm not sure if I should go to that or go to the make up bio lessons.  probably bio....  and I gotta take home the bio project!  like... soon!  egads.  it's been sitting there FOREVER...  -sweatdrop-  hmm... still gotta go do bio hw and french hw.  will probly just study tonight and do the hw tomorrow morning... haha.  me and my procrastinating.  I am good.  commapps was especially stupid today.  lisa and jack know my pain.  I gotta study study study!  gah!  I went to jackie's house today and baked mint brownies!  they were super yummy.  =)  I think they turned out v. well.  and it's a good thing ppl don't actually see us making them... or else no one would eat them.  hehehe.  ;-)  lol.  now... I gotta go study.  whoohooo~  ++sunny

      I'm bored so I'm updating.  whoohoo.  and I have an english test, algebra test tomorrow.  skew them, man.  don't you guys hate the week before any sort of big break where the teachers just pile all the quizzes/tests/projects on you?  it's like... gah!  gotta fit in all this stuff before a week of them doing nothing!  but they don't realize that other teachers are thinking the same thing... so we end up with a whole freaking crapload of stuff.  skew them.  I know what rank louisa and gabriel are now.  =D  so.  still need to know the ppl around me and jack.  do you like this color for the font or the regular old black?  meng told me the blog was too bland, so I tried spicing it up.  with a bland blue.  hahaha.  okay.  I actually went seaching around for templates...  but they all look tacky.  like... ubertacky.  I'm looking for what reminds me of a studio... like... simple but pretty.  with perhaps a few lines of color at top with the font small and spaced.  and that's it.  but there're all these really cluuuuuuttered layouts.  ulch.  wildflower project.  grr.  byebye now.  to get rid of chatterbox or not to get rid of chatterbox...?  -sigh-  ++sunny

You guys get a blog / xanga / diaryland / lj / dj / blogging thing.  Or unless I get so bored that I update for fun.  Which has not happened since maybe summer break.  Or unless I'm just super happy and actually will update upon request.  =)  so.  buh bye.  ++sunny

      FIIIINALLY, THE WEEK IS OOOOOOOOOVER!  god.  I am so knackered and tired and sore... I can hardly keep my eyes open!  louisa came over today and we finished our art projects.  finally!  done!  and we're GLAZING our projects in art!  which means we're painting the terra cotta with some chemicals, and when we fire them, they'll come out as pretty colors!  I'm so happy.  =)  We're painting our box, and invidually painting our coil pots.  [I worked w/louisa for the box]  aand now.... I can go sleep!  and read!  and like... do life lesson book.  darn.  and read fanfics!  wow that's so cool.  I realized that a lot of people at jasper annoy the bejeezus out of me.  just so freaking annoying.  grace is annoying me.  maybe I'm jealous.  ha!  in that case, I need some green shirts.  not, of course, that I'm admiting to anything.  I don't like jack.  at all.  AT ALL.  and if you accuse me of liking him, I will bite your head off and never update again in my life.  oh, what the heck.  maybe I do like him.  I dunno.  I just want next week to be over with, then review week to be over with, the exams to be over with, so I can escape to china for a month then come back and do the capitalism fair.  I swear, everyone already thinks I like jack.  I give up.  let me just escape into the anonymity of summer.  let's try some more stream of consciousness.  I'm so tired my eyes itch and i haven't slept in on too long and jack is the most annoying perv on earth.  i don't even know where that came from, maybe it's form that inuyasha fic i was readkin before i started updating this blog.  that must br iit, because i cannot thing o fon epervy thing jthat jack has done.  well eactually yes I can.  i can think o fmany incidences, actually.  maybe he's just too... i dunno.  strange about his sexuality.  i've never met such a queer straight person.  or maybe he's just pretending he's straight.  i'd like that.  i can so totally picture gay jack.  i bet i'm goin to look back on tihs period in my life later when i grow up and laugh at my stupidity.  and absurdity.  oh, well, i'm in the pressent now and i can't chage anything.  i'm typing wiht my eyes closed to get the full stream of oconsciousness effect ehre.  therefore, typos.  lots of them, probably.  louisa came over today and i told her tah tmeng liked jeff.  i cdon't care all tha tmuch , really.  i son't even know why.  maybe it's because of chuan.  so mayube if he kept telling me I like jack, i'll begin believe it sooner or later.  probably not, though.  i don't even know who I like best anymore.  oh, well.  I just want summer to come.  sweet oblivion!  i wonder what suicide feels like.  my mom told me her coworker's daugher commited suicide.  at age thriteen.  i've lived two lyears more already.  i wonder...?  =)

      puahahaha.  lots happened today.  dun feel like writing about it.  most of it too spastic to put down into words anyways.  jack came over today!  we somehow got 13 flowers... anyways.  he stayed until 10.  his mother knows my phone number now.  she called.  before, she never called.  even if it was like 11.30 or something.  my mom knows an awful lot about jack's family. and incidentally, so do I.  I was so embarrassed today.  haha.  my mom is in a mozart phase.  jack is tired of always coming over and listening to mozart.  jack thinks my mom is a bit too into classical music.  I told him so.  [he didn't believe me.]  I skipped lunch today.  then I wasn't hungry at dinner.  hmm.  fauvist suns and chained women!  joy.  that would be jack's painting and my painting, btw.  =)  and now... sleep.  [are these outline forms of my day good or bad?]

      today in french, I was talking to stacey because I didn't bring my workbook, and so we were... talking.  yeah.  and since we're asians, we got to talking about grades.  after some detours.  -cough-.  anyway, grades.  she was talking about hers suck and blah blah blah... the usual asian ramblings.  she's rank 29 with a 4.1 something gpa.  I was like, wow, the gpas drop fast.  anyway.  she said, "sunshine, you're famous!  my mom's friend's knows all about you and your grades."  and lisa, who came up to work with us cuz she didn't have a book, either, said, "Yeah!  my friend's mom knows about you, too..."  and I was like, "whoa.  fuh ree key."  ya.  other than that, french was totally boring.  as usual.  except for erica [from algebra] and catie kuisis.  they're so funny.  I actually talk to them in french.  it's kinda strange.  today in orchestra, they did auditions.  but I didn't know that they were today [b day does them before a day?  unfair!] so I didn't practice the music AT ALL before today.  so I was like craaaaaaaaaap.  so I hurried up and practiced and practiced.  and I actually got it down!  but then the conductor from PWHS came to talk to mrs booth, so that took up like 45 minutes, and we spent 20 minutes getting ready, and then some other junk happened, so only 2 or 3 violinists auditioned today.  -whew!-  then the stupid lab prac... don't even want to think about it.  then I got home, and chuan started telling me about his nefarious plans.  he is going to bribe kailing with BLUE RASPBERRY JOLLY RANCHERS.   BLUE RASPBERRY.   man.  that is just... beyond evil.  but maybe I will have a coupe and... interfere with his operation!  puahahaha.  hopefully, he has not talked to jack about it.  that would just be beyond embarrassing.  then my mom came home and we went to hobby lobby and got some art paper.  then we went to walmart so I could get some canvas... and then I got a book!  and I also got lots and lots of yarn.  yay.  so... yay!  I still have my commapps references to do.  so, ta ta, my bonny lasses.  =)  kailing - your ramblings... you ramble about everything.  hahaha.  but I was referring to your rambles about jack and chuan.  the whole "bugger off, you prats" kinda thing.  but not in those words.  and now you're gonna bother me about exactly what it was you were saying about them that would qualify as "rambling".  man.  meng - EMOTIONALLY UNSTABLE??  that's HOOOORRIBLE!  but if it makes you feel better, I'm going through hormonal imbalances right now.  most because of chuan.  grr.  wait.  not ta ta yet.  yesterday, jack came over to work on flower project.  we were walking along outside looking for maybe replacement flowers, and he went into this huge ant killing spree.  he went and dug into the ant hills... like, there's a hill.  above ground.  like this: /\  and then, he took the huge shovel and went dig!  dig!  dig! [all the while cursing them for always biting him], and when he was done, it looked like this: \/.  he did that to three ant hills.  and then he got tired.  haha.  and he thought yesterday was HOT.  man.  he has not lived through a texas summer.  I will be in china laughing at him this summer.  so then we came back home and we pressed flowers.  then my parents decided to come talk to jack.  man.  if I were jack, I'd be scared to death of my parents.  they're freaking psychotic.  so jack is pressing flowers... he sees a box of tictacs.  wintergreen, in case you were wondering.  so he goes and eats like... the whole box.   lots of wintergreen working there.  and my dad's outside barbequeing stuff.  and so he comes in, cuts off a bit of steak, and sticks it on a fork.  he tries to feed me with the fork by sticking it in front of my mouth.  I say no.  dad looks crestfallen!  jack is innocently [ha!] pressing flowers.  theeeen, dad sees jack!  dad has epiphany.  "jack, want to try some steak?!"  jack, "no... not really, thanks."  goes back to pressing flowers.  dad goes and jabs steak in front of jack's face.  jack looks up, startled.  I shrug at him.  he looks like o__o, but of course he is smiling.  so kinda like... 8)?  not quite,  anyway.  he's like, "uhh..."  my dad senses jack weakening... he moves onto final attack!  "come on, jack!  don't hurt my feelings by not eating it, like sunshine."  jack gives up.  [poor jack.]  he opens his mouth and my dad stick the fork in his mouth.  I look on.  it is quite interesting when your dad is spoon [fork] feeding your biology partner.  dad looks on.  jack chews, but still smiling.  dad says, "do you like it, jack?"  jack mumbles, "mmhmm!"  dad goes away, satisfied.  ["see, yang, jack says it's good!"]  jack waits until my dad is outside before saying, "it tastes interesting with a tictac in your mouth."  I almost die laughing.  then my brother came down to watch us, and we confused him with strange kant philosophy.  poor stephen.  he got so confused... he couldn't win!  then we started talking about dimensions.  first is a line.  second is square.  third is cube.  fourth is time/space.  fifth, according to a wrinkle in time, is a tesseract.  sixth, jack and I made up, is pocahontas.  [because, you see, pocahontas was an indian.. and she had to go to england.. which means she was in two different places.. so in the sixth dimension, you can be in two places at once!] seventh is sun.  [haha.  sunshine and jack sun, get it?  hahaha.] [so in seventh, time is basically folded.  you exist with every form of yourself throughout time simultaneously.]  there was some serious psychological thinking going on in there.  =)  and then we waited for the flowers to get pressed.  so of course, we went and played super smash brothers melee!  and at first, it was only my brother and jack playing the computers, but then they got me to play with them, too.  I TOTALLY SCHOOLED THEM WITH KIRBY.  ha!  it was puh-ritty awesome!  hehehehehe.  and then we were like, maybe we should go check on the flowers.  so we did.  then we played more ssbm.  I schooled them some more.  puahahaha.  and they said I sucked at video games.  then it was eight and jack was like holy crap!  and he called his dad and he came to pick jack up and then everyone went home and we were all happy peachy.  for the first half of the afternoon, though, I was thinking "die, jack, die."  hahaha.  hormonal imbalances, indeed.  then today in art, I realized that I was sooo behind... I mean, I was supposed to be done with newspapering and manilla papering my armature by last tueday, and today I was still finishing up newspapering and just began on manilla paper!  I was supposed to begin painting today!!  but the good thing is, lots of other ppl are behind, too.  and our halfway is due next class!  I'll probably just be lazy and watercolor.  cuz that's fastest.  lol.  I'm so lazy.  SO!  wow.  this is a super long entry.  so you better have some nice, insightful comments for me.  >=O  haha, just kidding.  now, I'm off to go read some books!  and do the rest of my commapps hw... man.  toodles, bonny lasses!

      okay.  why am I still up at four in the morning?  especially when I got up at 7.45 yesterday?  man.  this is wacked up.  anyways.  I can barely stay awake.  I'm reading a nice kenshin fanfic, though!  =)  I want to go back to reading kenshin in chinese.  though that will keep me from my hw.  which is bad.  I got stuck on 22 on the bookwork and was too tired to do the worksheet.  didnt do french yet, either.  but it's french.  haha.  finished bio lab, though!!  =D  yay.  I accidentally touched an anther then rubbed my nose with the same finger.  not smart.  now I can't stop sneezing.  whoo.  no one is online...  I did my chinese hw in record time today!  one hour for an entire week!  that's amaaazing.  especially since the hour was from 12.30-1.30 am.  haha.  I am seriously turning into a zombie.   I'd like to see if I can go 24 hours w/o sleep, but I have chinese school tomorrow, so it may not be that smart.  oooo.  gotta give eileen something for her birthday.  anyway.  I'm so sleepy I'm turning hyper.  which is never good.  =D  see, I'm hyper enough to be updating my blog like this.  meng, are you okay, dearest heart?  [hehe, that sounds so cool.]  depression does not suit your rosy cheeks!  [puahaha.]  seriously, though.  be you okay?  now.  sleep for sunshine.  kailing, do be a good bonny lass now.  ^~  and tell me.  do you really hate jack and chuan?  b/c i am getting worried about your strange ramblings.  now. really sleep for sunshine.  not really.  first read 60,000 more words of fic.  then sleep.

      Chuan came over 7.45 this morning.  and I wasn't up yet.  so it was a bit strange.  but anyways.  we went flower picking.  and I got a stomach ache.  but we got lots of flowers!  which was good.  but we also saw lots of girls in various states of undress.  which wasn't so good.  then we came back in.  and then I tried on my gap dress for him!  he was a bit disturbed.  then I put on jeans under it, and he said he saw my underwear.  naughty chuan.  not turning away.  he doesn't think the gap dress is formal enough.  but what does he know of such matters?  nothing.  =)  then we went to sonic as cuzzys and got some food. then we came back home and I realized how strange my morning was, and I told him to go home.  I like my gap dress.  skew.  so now I am in various states of undress.  whoo.  we went to the DMA for the field trip!  I got to skip the greater half of orchestra.  go me!  then yesterday I got to leave rehearsals early, so I only really played for 5 minutes.  go me!  wheee.   at the dma, I took the contemporary tour!  I saw jackson pollocks.  =)  his painting all look suspiciously similar... haha.  I learned lots of interesting things about jackson pollock.  and then I saw some mondrians!  which is always cool.  then some picassos and the candy exhibit!  awesome, man.  louisa and I stole so much candy...  hehe.  louisa is so cool.  and on the bus rides, we fantasized about banquet dresses.  we were being so girly.  it was fun.  then we got back to jasper and we were so tired.  we did nothing!  then we went to the counselor together.  some really wacked up things, man.  then eighth period, during which I was completely dead.  but that's okay.  nothing ever happens in french, anyways.  then I went to bio tutorials with jack and grace and she went to take the hum test.  then we waited for her dad to come pick us up and irene and aarthi talked about ranks and I learned some very common very wrong perceptions.  it was very interesting, all in all.  then yesterday I was very messed up.  but it was all good.  I ran into bio to look at the slides, then there was an ESOL class in there, and it was interesting.  then I went to algebra where I got my report card.  blaergh.  but I can't really bring myself to care about it all that much.  then today on the walk to sonic, chuan was telling me about a talk ning had with him in humanities.  guess what it was about?  yar.  so anyway, he was like, "she said that kailing and I should conviently get lost so jack and sunny can spend some time together."  and I was like awwww, maaaaaaaaaaan.  and I told him some stuff, too.  =)  hehe.  it was very funny.  egads.  anyway, he blabbed. so yeah.  I can't wait until may 8!  it will be oodles of fun.  and then I got home and read a RK fic.  and now I'm like, hmm.  I think I'm in denial about my feelings.  and I know I'm in denial.  but as long as I am in denial, I don't feel it.  like, I can raelly stop myself from feeling things.  it is strange.  but once I take away teh denial, I know I'll feel it.  so my denial is just up.... and up... and up.  until I know the feeling is gone.  then I can be out of denial.  =)  so I'm pretty sure I HAVE liked ppl before, but I've never liked them.  if that makes sense.  but of course, I'm not sure sure because of that denial.  haha.  it's like I'm living in one big dream.  the most esoteric book I've read is the history of mankind.  published in 1921, the first newbery award book ever.

      okay. so here's a better post.  about my dream, no less!  whoo.  anyways.  so there was a bed.  a really really really big bed.  and kailing and chuan were on the bed!  doing what you do on beds together.... sleep!  durh.  and they were sleeping TOGETHER.  and it was super strange.  hehehehe.  but super cute!  and they were asleep... side by side... and chuan was hugging kailing!!!   -awww...-  and that was the chuan and kailing part of my dream.  they slept through the whole dream.  whoo.  they must be having pretty darn good dreams together!  -hehehe-  and I'm not telling my part of the dream.  cuz that's just disturbing.  my unconscious is trying to tell me lies!!  LIES!!  I so do not feel that way.  grr.  anyways.  I found a longlost gap dress in my closet today!  I wonder if it will work as the banquet dress.  probably not.  grr.  but I want to go dress shopping this weekend!  kailing, let us go!  hehehehehe.  the gap dress is so happy.  it was so cheap.  it was only 7.50.  hahahaha.  and the original price was 50 dollars.  hahaha.  that is so sad.  anyways.  I don't think it's formal.  so.  yeah.  I like it!  it was at the back of my closet for ages.  now...  I went flower picking with chuan and jackie and yini today.  I went crazy over yellow primroses.  I picked over 20 of them!  I just pulled them out of the ground.  and then jackie and chuan drowned them... so I had to keep pulling more.  and then we were like, "ooh, flower!  do we need it?  dunno!  let's just pick it and see!"  so we did.  we had to pull six of every flower cuz we were all on diff groups.  except jackie and chuan.  anyways.  so then we pulled flowers!  and then we went to jackie's house and pressed them like crazy.  and then jason had a group project going on, too!  and all of them laughed at us for having to do the flower project.  but we got like... 5 flowers today!  for everyone!   I was like, "wow, that was productive!"  I was a master digger.  =D  OH, chuan DROPPED HIS SPADE ON MY HEAD.  like, he was standing over me watching me dig a yellow primrose, and he just DROPPED HIS SPADE.  and the sharp pointy end hit me square on the head!  and I was like "ooooowwww~~~  chuaaaaaaan...!!!"  and he was like, "sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry!"  and then he rubbed my head.  and I was like, "don't touch my head.  HAHAHAHA.  cuz I pulled AND pressed ALL his flowers.  cuz he can't pull or press.  I'm serious.  he and jackie... dunno how they do it.  they're so totally on crack.  and then jackie and I read the balcony scene from RJ!!  I was romeo and she was juliet.  and now I'm gonna go try out for  a part cuz I can't stand having teresa rodriguiz stumbling all over the shakespearean language and reading all slow like that.  in her HIGH PREPPY voice, too.  grr.  okay, since kailing is pressuring me and since I dun wanna write five notes, I'm gonna publish it now.  =D

      I SALVAGED THE TREES!!!  and I thought the trees were surely unsalvagable...  but it's a miracle!!  =DD  I'm staying up for the sole purpose of keeping jack company.  this is so sad.  he's compressed our stuff so much that it's 80 mb and it... has... no sound.... -_____-;;  I am resisting the urge to go into my room and color and color and paint and paint and SALVAGE THE MESS THAT IS OUR MOVIE POSTER.  but the rock is quite nice.  but watch me to do something to that, too.  I love my fan brush.  it helped me salvage our trees!  wheee yay.  MANGO MADNESS!  lol.

I spent approx. half an hour tonight faxing all my bio notes over to jack b/c he lost all of his.  -____- joy.  then I typed up the master list of archetypes!  which was interesting.  I hope we didn't get any of it wrong...  -___-  more stream of consciousness?  na.  not tonight.  gonna go brush my teeth and sleep now.  =D

      wheehehehe.  I like my new layout.  how about you?  =)  I like the little AIM popup things.  they're so fun!  I think I'm going to change them every day.  hehehe.  I think I'm going to try to update every day, too.  maybe I'll even update at a specific time!  but probably not.  I am too lazy.  haha.  do you think I should tell the world about this blog?  then it'll have more interesting comments... but not nearly as much interesting stuff on the posts.  cuz then it'd have to pass through a more severe censor.  anyways, I have seventy more pages of GE to read before tomorrow.  and some crappy life lessons to think up.  at lunch, most likely.  whoo.  I have to go type up my cultural event!  TOMORROW IS SCHOOL AGAIN!!  good thing is, now I can breathe!  I was talking to ning on the phone today...  she told me that pearl lee knows of the "sunshine sun" joke.  I was like, "wth?"  then I was like, "omg, that thing spreads FAST."  and then I realized that about 3 different people thought of it at the same time.  egads.  it's spreading!!!  this sucks butt.  and then she asked me if I liked jack.  and I said no.  "are you sure?" 'positive.' "positive positive?" 'yeah... but if I continue to work with him on all these projects, I probably will start to like him sooner or later.  just cuz my mind will say -hey, sunshine, how come you don't like jack?  you see so much of him... I think it'd only be proper if you liked him-, and then I'll begin liking him.  then I'll see he's really just a pompous ass and get over it.'  then we debated if jack went out with girls before or not.  I think no, not seriously [as in maybe he went and saw a movie with some, but nothing serious], and ning thinks he's made out with every girl in canada.  -_____-;;  now.  let's try writing stream of consciousness style.  but I can't not take it.. there's a test sitting right in front of me!  I can't ignore it!  I have to go scratch my toe soon.  egads.  straight up... hmm.  I don't really like paula abdul.  I wonder why I'm using paragraph breaks in this... I want to go download under the tuscan sky.  or was it under this tuscan sky?  grace just signed off.  i wonder if she really got off or if she just closed her eye.  i'm too lazy to go check.  neopets is addicting.  why am I so competitive in everything?  why do i feel i must be best at everything?  even something as trivial as neopets.  i wonder if i would be happier being stupid.  i love the song superman.  i think it describes gundam wing perfectly.  i love it so so much.  it's so sad and melancholy, though.  i don't like melanie much.  i thikn i'm relaly jealous of her.  why?  why?  why am i jealous of people?  maybe i feel i'm inferior.  i probably am.  i must be better than melanie.  i must go paint a portrait of jack and give it to him to say thank you.  i wonder when jack's mom will be back.  i like jack's mom.  she's so nice to me.  she has really small feet.  i like jack's dad.  he's nice to me, too.  his whole freaking family is so nice to me.   i wonder what he thinks of my family.  too overbearing?  i feel they are too overbearing.  why is jack signing on and off?  didy annoys me at times. m aybe i am jealous of her, too.  then why am i not jealous of kailing?  i probably am.  i don't like this.    am i protective of jack?  i feel i am.  i think i'm possessive.  taht's not good.  why am i possessive of jack?  i don't even like him.  or do i?  i probably do.  but denial is so much more fun than reality.  i don't want to be possessive.  why didn't i focus all my energy on someone else?  that would have been so much better.  i think i am drifting farther away from meng and jackie.  i think it's because of movie project.  but i really cannot say i'd choose to change my group, had i the chance.  but i don't like losing meng.  i don't like jenna.  i hate her guts.  she is so preppy and annoying and girlly.  i agree with chuan about that.  i want to know who chaun is thinking of.  i want to go kill jenna.  i don't like her at all.  i think i hate her even more than I hate melanie.  melanie kissed jack for their movie.  jenny tells me on the lips.  i do not know what to think.  i think she enjoyed it, even though she has protested it so severely.  go figure.  stupid idiot.  and that is all for my stream of consciousness tonight.  =)

      I am MISERABLE.  How do you combat the loss of one hour of sleep on DST weekends? You don't sleep at all.  I do not recommend allnighters.  But this totally was not my fault.  at all.  I have allergies.  the allergies decided to act up.  my nasal passage is so freaking blocked; it's worse than US 75 during rush hour.  I seriously cannot breathe through my nose.  at all.  not even a bit.  it's like suffocation here.  then my throat is sore as freaking heck.  so I'm breathing through my mouth... and my tonsils are swelling like no other, and they're getting dry, and I start hacking away, and that requires me to force air through my nose, which just pushes at the wall of snot and ends up doing nothing but making my throat worse.  so I lay in bed for about... 2 hours doing this.  I slept at 2am, which is really 3am, so I was doing that until about 5am.  then I decide it's hopeless and go down to tell my parents.  they go get me some medicine.  it doesn't help.   so I come back upstairs and decide that sleep for tonight is totally 100% impossible.  so I decide to do homework.  not very smart.  I drip snot all over my papers and have to run to the bathroom every 10 seconds to wash snot off my hand.  it is super gross.  but I manage to finish reading humanities, nonetheless.  and then I debated starting on GE.  decided that snot would make the pages of the book stick together.  better not attempt that just yet.  So I lay in bed for a few more minutes.  perhaps half an hour.  decide that lying down just makes the snot roll around in my nasal cavity, so my nostrils take turns getting more blocked up than the other.  not very fun.  at times, both are so congested that it's like, oh em gee, I'm going to die here.  so I get up and read some crossroads.  then I decided that if sleep is impossible, I may as well get online and see if I can untangle some of our film.  so here I am.  with a congested nasal cavity, a red, sore nose from all the times I've tried to blow my nose, dry, ucky skin, a sore, itchy throat, no sleep, no food for 10+ hours, a headache, and chinese school in 5 hours.  I just love my life oh so much.

      puahaha.  just got back from jack's house... and it's midnight.  whoo.  we [chuan and I] stayed until chuan beat FF9 (at around 11.15), then we watched the ENTIRE ending, which took so freaking long, and all the BLATANT THEMES!  holy crap.  it was so freaking cheesy...!  and then jack was getting SAPPY on us.  it was the scariest thing, because chuan and I were just sitting there reading the text, and jack was like, "if you actually play the game through, you get attached to the characters because you get to know them, and the ending's actually really really sad..."  and chuan and I were going, "OMG, JACK'S TURNING INTO SAP..."  and jack goes, "it's good to be sappy like five days of the year... but then it gets old"  and then he started talking about how it's all so sad!  and how it's all so sweet!  and how it's all so sappy!  and chuan and I were thinking, "sappy!jack!!!!!"  and then we talked about pokemon and reminisced about our lovely pokemon playing days.  we had a huge discussion about mewtwo and the legendary pokemon.  and then we came home.  =)  I don't like lisa's jokes very much.  =(

      I'm composing an email right now and am emailing it to my blog.  I wonder if it will publish properly!  I wonder if a title will show up.  All these things I am wondering, while I should be asleep.  This would make publishing in China oh so much simpler, though.  So I hope this works.  Okay now I've really got to be going.

      18 posts my butt; I have 86 posts on the blog.  Screw.  Anyway.  This shall be my last post for 4 weeks.  Try and bear the sorrow, darling friends.  Unless Kerry brings his computer to China and lets me update on it.  But then he'd know the blog address.  Oh, woe is me.  Did you know you can update your blog by email?  I think I shall try that sometime.  It is 2am now, and I shall not go to sleep.  But then I'll miss the movie on the plane.  So perhaps I should go to sleep.  Yes.  I keep feeling like I'm forgetting something.  I ought to go put that lotion in my bag now cuz I won't remember tomorrow morning.  -sigh-  I'm all depressed now.  I shall miss my family oh so much.  Eileen and Kerry!  Think of fun times with Eileen and Kerry!  Aaaah.  College shall be an entire YEAR without parents!  How will I cope??  Let's not think that far ahead.  For now... farewell, true loves.  =)

Which means it'll be four weeks and one day before we can talk to each other again!  =OOOO  DON'T FORGET TO GET ME GIIIIIIIIIIFTS IN CHINA!  HAHAHA I AM SHAMELESS.  I don't know what to say now.  Nothing happened today except that I slept and I ate and I talked to Kailing on the phone for four hours!  Or almost, anyway.  =)  I HAVE A 94 IN ENGLISH HAAAAAAA!  At my rate of improvement in English (3 points per semester), I should be getting an A+ next year!  Hopefully, I'll get a good teacher.  Golden would be lovely.  I WANT TO KNOW WHAT JACK GOT ON THE WORLD HISTORY EXAM DAAAAAAARNIT.  >=(  I should end this on a positive note.  KAILING, I WILL GET YOU LOTS AND LOTS AND LOTS OF THINGS FROM CHINA!

      I am horribly horribly HORRIBLY indecisive.  You know how I was oh-so-happy with that DB bag that was oh-so-cute and oh-so-impractical (as it fit almost nothing) but OH-SO-HAPPY.  Well, today, I decided to accompany my parents go Sam's Club to go shopping for some odd reason, because that store ususally does not interest me at all.  So I went.  And as we were heading for the checkout, we pass by this display with purses in it.  And it just happens to have a DB bag in it.  So my mom goes and asks the salesman person to take out that bag for her to look at.  (The first bag I showed you, Kailing.)  So he goes under his little counter thing and starts pulling out all these DB bags!  Like, ones that weren't even in the display!  (How, I'd like to know, do you expect to sell bags if no one knows you're selling them?)  So he got out the bucket bag and the one that I liked, and my mom was like, "Look at this one!  It's so much more practical.  You can fit so many more things in it."  And I was thinking, "But it's UUUUGLY."  But then my dad chimes in, so I end up getting that bag anyway.  So then I come home, and I'm like, "I don't want this.  This is freaking ugly."  So now tomorrow they're going to get the bag I really wanted in the first place.  =)  It's $105 at Sam's Club.  Whoo.  Both of them.  The Coach one I showed you was $99 at Costco.  I shall go to Beijing and go to Xiu Shui Jie and get all the fake brand name stuff I can possibly want.  Which means lots and lots of bags.  =)  Today, Jack asked me to go to Six Flags with him before he realized that I was going back to China on Thursday and therefore would be unavailable to do ANYTHING remotely concerning him for a month.  Hehe.  I think our potato salad today was a smashing success!  Now I shall go to sleep so I can be up and ready to play tennis tomorrow at 8.      Ha!  Who am I kidding?  I'm not likely to go to sleep before 1, much less NOW.  Hilarious.

      Since you're the only one who ever reads this anyway, Kailing, I'm just gonna write a note to you here instead of actually writing one out.  (Haha.  I'm a lazy bum.)  And the note will have numbers, so you can respond to each part seperately.  (Your comments are so hard to understand sometimes.  Can't match up where a "loll" corresponds to, since I found nothing funny about my post.  Ah, well.)  Dearest Kailing Heart-  (1) I do sincerely resent that.  I so was not flirting with Jack.  I don't know where these silly notions are coming from.  For 1010 and Ning's information, while THEY were finding the time to gossip about little things like that, Jack and I were hauling desks from room to room.  Yes, that's right, we were actually  working .  Inconceivable as that may seem.  But it was tons and tons of fun.  The main reason we disappeared for so long like that was because Jack hates Tracey's guts.  It was so hilarious.  We saw you guys standing by the stairs, and so we went back and hid in the corridor.  Then you guys just STAYED there.  So then we had to come out to get to the G rooms.  (2) He was the one who dragged me to proctor with him.  I didn't volunteer to proctor with him.  He said, "Sunshine, come proctor with me.  I don't want to proctor by myself."  Then he went and found Anna and said, "Sunshine's proctoring first grade with me."  So I was like, "Okay... whatever."  So I went and proctored with him.  Though since I was the fourth first grade proctor, I had to keep running between to rooms in case someone had to go to the restroom or needed anything or something like that.  So every five minutes or so, I'd go out and check on the other two rooms.  First we played War.  But then the kids kept asking SO MANY questions... so then we were both up and about answering questions.  Then we were like, "Now what?  The kids are all finished."  So we just went and graded the tests.  We were master graders.  He graded first column (1-10), and I graded last column (21-30).  Then we both graded second column (11-20).  It was super fast.  We memorized the answers!  (3) Then we got dragged up to the grading room.  And since we were done already, we just wandered around.  Then we went out to put the desks back, but then we lazed out and just went to that lounge area and sat and talked for a while.  Then we got bored of sitting.  So we went around and pulled the signs off all the walls.  Then we went back to the room.  That's why we were gone so long, in case you were wondering.  (4) Then you and 1010 were by the laptop, so Jack and I just talked with Ning.  She is one bitter person.  She says that ranks are all screwed up because everyone in the top 10 cheats.  (I can't believe even SHE buys into that.  WE DON'T CHEAT!  I mean, ten people HAVE to be in the top ten, no matter what.)  Then she said, "I want to go to Harvard."  And Jack just told me earlier that afternoon that Harvard was the one school he wanted to go to.  So he just said, "Hn." to that.  Interesting, isn't it?  (5) So all in all, we just spent the entire day together.  -___-  BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.  We spent about five minutes arguing about what color the shirt was.  That is how inane our conversations were.  (6) That volunteer thing was FUN.  God, I loved it so much.  (NOT BECAUSE OF JACK.  Though he told me that he liked it, too.)  I want to do something like that again.  =D  (7) Would you like to tell me what else 1010 and Ning were saying about us?  (8) When Ning said something along the lines of, "You guys just want to spend time together" (before we went to "put the desks back", I think), Jack spent five minutes questioning me about why my friends were so strange.  Then he spent another five minutes complaining about how his friends thought the same thing.  -__-  But to a lesser degree, of course.  (9) Okay, now that I've spent a whole lot of words on Jack, let's talk about tomorrow.  I need a belt.  I must go get a belt.  Troy will be fun!  Jack watched it tonight.  When he told me he was going to watch it with Justin and Meng, I thought he meant Meng Meng at first, not Felix Meng.  So I was a bit freaked out.  (10) I went to BN today and got Nine Stories and that other book.  Yay!  Now I can read on the plane and in China.  I think I will reread His Dark Materials on the way to/in/from China.  I love that series!  It deserves to be reread.  *heart* Sunshine  OKAY THERE'S THE END OF THE "NOTE"!  Whoo.  I was back to Jack again, wasn't I?  Ah, well.  I read xxxHOLiC today.  It's interesting.  I think it's going to turn into my favorite CLAMP series.  (Except ERIOL-KUN!)  Okay, now I must go.  I want to sleep.  I slept at 2 this morning cuz I couldn't fall asleep, then I had to get up at 8.15.  Ahaha.

      Today was the last day of exams!  Last day of freshmen year!  I can hardly believe it.  But yay!  I'm so happy.  Since I am not stingy about my grades, I will list them here.  First grade is exam grade, second is semester average.  (I'm not sure I used 'stingy' correctly.  Oh, well.)  Humanities: 95; 94 Algebra II: 100; 98 Communication Applications: 97; 98 (same grade in commapps as algebra?  what the heck?) English: Don't know Orchestra: >97, I'm guessing Biology: 98; 98 Art: 97; 97 French: >97, I'm also guessing  Three people in our algebra II class got A+s.  Me, Kailing, and Tim.  Tim is a claw in my gut.  Since when did he get so good at math?  I am maddened.  He made us into a triumvirate, instead of the "Indefatigable Freshmen".  Not sure that made that much sense, either, but regardless.  It sounds cool.  And it sounds superior.  And superiority is very important when you're a freshman.  Not that I am either superior OR a freshman now.  Then in French, I was so bored and so ready for summer that I just did the exam and turned it in.  Didn't even bother checking it.  Then Lisa, Yini, Stacey and I played cards.  It was very fun and very interesting.  I love them so much.  Then I went around and checked grades!  I was searching for Kailing for the longest time.  Instead, I found Jack.  Joy.  Because we were both at the biology hall.  We both said, "I got a 98!" at the same time.  Then we were like, "You did?  Cool!"  And Lisa was standing there in between us feeling bad.  Poor Lisa.  Then some more stuff happened (I found Kailing), and then we went to the mall!  There were so many people we knew at the mall...  very bad for a person like me.  For some reason, it seems that no matter what I do, I'm still noticable.  I am doomed to be noticed.  Mean Girls was interesting.  The air conditioning upstairs is broken.  It is constantly 89 degrees up here.  I am drowning in urea here.  I'm pretty sure there was a curve on the biology test...  no way could I have gotten a 98.  I mean, missing only 2?  I haven't missed only 2 on anything for a really really long time.  And I was unsure about so many.  I mean... farmers?  What system could both skin and lungs belong to?  What do kidneys do?  I mean... I was so freaking confused!  And I had no freaking clue!  And now that it's summer and school is really, truly behind me for seventy some odd days... I find myself with absolutely NOTHING TO DO.  I mean, not doing anything isn't nearly as fun when you don't have anything better to do.  During the school year, avoiding homework and doing nothing felt greate because not doing anything was at least better than doing homework, right?  And now there's nothing I should be doing.  So the forbidden pleasure isn't so forbidden anymore.  This sucks.  I had forgotten how boring summer is.

      Yesterday, when I updated, it said I had 18 posts on this blog.  Now, I know for a fact that I have  way  more than 18 posts on this blog.  Even I update more often than that.  So.  Blogger is skewed.  It said on my old old blog that I had 91 posts.  That, I'm more inclined to believe.  18 posts!  Don't kid me, please.  I went to Macy's with my mom today.  I saw that cute cute purse thing.  My mom wants to get it for me before I go to China.  Good luck, mom.  You have a week.  But then when I went back to Costco.com to check, the purse wasn't there anymore.  Eh.  Whatever.  I should go study my art terms, as I usually memorize them for a test then forget them directly afterwards.  I should also go rememorize my French grammar.  I am a total dunce at French grammar.  I have just realized that all the most important people (aka Kailing, Su, Angela... less so Angela, but whatever) to me haven't signed my yearbook.  And yet people like Jack and Chuan and Didy and Peter Tong, for goodness' sake, have signed it.  That's just plain crazy, people.  I don't want to remember THOSE people.  I just realized that I'm going to miss my mom when I go to China.  A whole month without her!  How will I live?  Especially with my grandparents!  Slightly deaf, slighly cuckoo grandparents, to boot!  One who is beyond obsessed about my grades, and the other who doesn't give a whit about what I do.  I am slated for doom!  This should be capital punishment.  I am just glad Eileen and Kerry will also be in Nanjing with me.  My mom is feeling foiled because then I will speak English.  Haha!  I love playing Neopets oh so much.  All my study time has gone into that cursed game.  But I cannot help but feel the urge to play more of it.  Most of the time I'm not even playing, persay.  Just waiting for restocks or looking around trades or something like that.  I am glad the school year is almost over.  Three more hours.  Then I will not have to see those annoying little pricks for the entire summer.  Until August 4 rolls along and I have to submit myself back to the torture that is Jasper High School.  Plus all those gibbering little freshmen.  Who will most likely go about kissing Kailing's feet until their ranks come out.  Either that or secretly despising her.  Again, until their ranks come out.  Then they will be asking, "When do we get our ranks?  I want to know our ranks!"  Then, inevitably, the Daniel Wangs and Tracys of freshmen year will drive me bonkers.  Let me hope I get a fairly decent humanities class.

      Yes!  I will update my blog religiously!  I will not skip a day!  I must post and try to make my very mundane life sound at least marginally interesting!  Or die trying.  I'll probably end up dead, trying.  Ah, well, at least I died fighting.  I love being a martyr!  That is the coolest word.  I can never pronunce it, though.  That freaking English exams was inordinately hard.  It was so impossible.  The answer choices were so close, it was beyond crazy.  I wanted to stab Mrs. Lux.  But then I got a 100 on my life lesson book, so I was happy.  Which means that for once, I'll have an A+ in that class for a six weeks!  I am beyond amazed.  Miracles DO happen!  This morning I was avoiding the commapps room like the plague.  DID NOT want to step into that room.  I hate that room with such a fierce passion.  I went to Byers tutorials in the morning.  It helped me zippo.  I saw Jack there (both of them), and I realized that they were both gits.  So there goes the end of that situation.  THEEEEEN.  Kailing wouldn't sign my yearbook!  And she signed CHUAN'S.  Geez.  Just that name annoys me.  I will not speak of it any further.  Kailing!  How COULD you?  I mean... we're like THIS CLOSE!  And it's your own fault for not signing my yearbook earlier when there were bunches of blank pages.  I am very disappointed in you.  Let us get off that topic now.  I must study for bio with my lovely Lisa Ying-Ying Wang!  =D  I would like to meet this Camille Bagby person.  I have heard from several sources that she is very very hot.  I hope I get classes with her next year!  In English today, I was looking at people's toenails.  Tiantian has painted hers this lovely shade of turquoise.  And it's metallic, too!  So it sparkled in the sun and made me not concentrate on my exam.  Which is bad.  Then I looked at Christine (Cepelak)'s toenails.  They were clear with these sparkly foil things in them.  Like confetti!  And they sparkled, too.  So I was surrounded by sparkly toenails!  And Christine's fingernails were sparkly, too.  I was sparkled to death.  Then on my bus ride home with Yini, I talked to her about gene frequencies and who would have pretty babies together.  From a purely biological point of view, of course.  I have decided that if Jack and I were somehow to combine our genes and create a baby, it would be the most demented baby in the world.  I mean, really.  Our traits mashed together then divided?  I think not.  It would turn out to be a Frankensteinesque baby.  The poor thing.  Then I thought about Ning and _____.  They would have either the wimpiest or stubbornest child in the world.  In either case, I think it serves both of them right, so I really hope they procreate together.  I will not go into the details about other people that I have discussed, for those other people will be prone to kill me.  And I want to live.  Now I will go reread Ender's Shadow and wallow in my hatred some more.

      I've been meaning to update this stupid journal as faithfully as I could, but alas, life got in the way.  Actually, not life, persay, just my laziness and general lack of any motivation right now.  There're only three more days (alas!) of school, 6 more exams, 12 more hours.  Then I'm freeee for the summer!  How blissfully wonderful.  A very interesting thought crossed my mind today.  How do you know when you've STOPPED liking someone?  I mean, it'd be nice if your hormones just popped up in front of your face one day and said, "Hey!  Look!  Your body's stopped producing these hormones.  You can resume your everyday, normal life now.  Sorry for the interruption."  But of course, no, nature isn't so kind.  Not that I've stopped liking him, really.  Just... I want to.  Because truthfully, he drives me bonkers.  That attitude, and that stupid voice, and that SMELL.  I can't get his smell out of my head.  I wonder about smells.  It's amazing how a smell can just stick in your head for the longest time.  It's like... it gets lodged there.  I can recognize things by their smell before anything else.  For example, there is this particular smell in the fall that just reminds me of my grandmother.  In first grade, she used to go to the bus stop with me, and the day smelled like that.  So now I connect that smell to that memory.  Memories have smells.  Isn't that interesting?  I want to be able to write.  Not write inanely, but write with a purpose.  The maximum meaning for the minimum number of words.  I could never do that, though.  I'm not talented enough.  And I'm not patient enough to sit down and start writing and writing and writing to try to get my writing that way.  I'm too impulsive, I guess.  I wonder that I can draw at all.  Maybe that's why my art projects are always so crappy.  I never take any time on them.  I just sit down and draw the fastest thing I can.  Then I turn it in and hope that my test grades will make up for those crappy project grades.  Then I go to class and I see Esther's projects and Melanie's projects and Louisa's projects and I feel so inferior.  I want to be able to sign someone yearbook in SUCH an awesome way that it'll be remembered for years and years.  I have to wait until next year, though, I guess.  There are only so many things you can do to those little in-between spaces.  I hate people who sign yearbooks with a message just long enough to take up the page but not long enough to fill up the page.  It pisses me off beyond all reason.  And now I should be studying for my commapps exam and my english exam, but alas, once again, my laziness will do me in.  My laziness ought to go hang.  So I will think happier thoughts.  Like how I will be going to China in nine days and leave Texas for a blissful four weeks.  That means no Jack or Chuan or Grace or Lisa or Alice or anyone.  Just Kerry and Eileen in Nanjing with me.  I'll be able to speak Chinese and walk around the city with no adults and when I get hungry, I'll just look to the right and look to the left and choose a food vendor from one of my sides.  And I'll get a yummy bread roll or dumpling for just a yuan or something.  And I can spend my entire day on the streets looking for cheap art supplies or pretty paper or Chinese books or calendars.  Just three more days.  Three more.  Kailing, do you want to see Mean Girls on Friday with me?  I don't know how we'll get there, but I'm sure we'll think of something.  =)

      So.  It's almost 6.30am.  I'm still up.  WHOOHOO!  And you know what's REALLY amazing?  Besides the fact that I'm actually capitalizing letters?  I'M NOT SLEEPY!  I know.  Inconceivable.  At around 2, I was deathly sleepy.  But now I'm just like, "Eh.  Whatever.  I'm doomed to get no sleep tonight.  Let's be a martyr!"  But then I didn't know exactly what was so horrible that I needed to be a martyr for.  So that ship capsized pretty quickly.  Kerry told me he'd be up at 6.30 to study humanities.  I'm waiting for him to get up so I can invite him over to study with me.  I already asked my mom, and she said it was okay if he came over.  Yay!  Misery just adores company, you know.  HE'S ONLINE!  YAY!  Okay.  Will talk about my night later, then.  =)  GOOD MORNING!

      Wow.  today was SUCH a fun day.  =)  First, I woke up at 8.20.  of course, I didn't get up until 9.  I went downstairs and finished my chinese review packet.  then I got online and did some random crap, typed about .6 more pages of orch essay, then I had to go eat breakfast and study for chinese.  then I went to chinese.  joy.  I reviewed the entire semester of stuff in like... 30 minutes.  and I was the first person in the class to finish the test.  basically because all that stuff was stored in my short term memory and I was just like MUST... FILL... IN...  so then I finished at like... 1.  so I went and helped my mom collect money for the fall registration.  then I left chinese school at 2.15.  we went to sam's club to get some stuff to bring to jack's house.  joy.  then JACK'S HOUSE!  so fun.  we went and at first it was awkward.  cuz we were like, "hi."  "hi."  "now what?"  and then he played this war game thing... and I was just watching.  and his mom tried to feed me.  and my brother.  yeah.  HIS MOM MAKES SUCH YUMMY FOOD.  HOLY CRAP.  then at like 4, his mom was like, "let's go eat!"  so of course we all went and ate.  then while we were eating [adults in kitchen, jack, me, stephen in computer room], he showed us clips from last samauri.  as far as I can tell, the plot is something like this: tom cruise goes to japan to help national army beat samurais. tom cruise makes friends with a samurai. they have times together. samurai dies protecting tom cruise. tom cruise is a disillusioned, sad person.  puahahaha.  that was cool.  then we went up to jack's room and did... random stuff.  interesting facts about jack's room: he has a globe hanging from his ceiling in one corner. there is one wind chime and two bells hanging around that globe. there is a pufferfish in another corner. he has a drawing of sakura [really bad drawing] from a girl named eva chen from toronto. he got new, happy bedspreads.  and a happy pillow cover. he has all the books mentioned in the hum book from this year. he has a chair in his bathroom.  then we got bored of jack's room.  then we went outside!!!  OMG IT WAS SO COOL.  we went on a hike!  we were walkin and walking... then we were like creek!  and so we went to the creek bank.  we went down right by the dog park parking lot.  and we were trekking... first we saw these TINY fish.  minnow.  and we tried catching some, but it didn't work.  funny, though!  then we headed down the creek.  cuz we were like, "eh.  whatever.  let's just go."  so we climbed and ducked and waded and skirted.  then it was pretty uneventful... except I had to keep reassuring jack and steph that no, those leaves were NOT poison ivy and yes, I'm SURE.  then I found out my brother was a complete wimp.  he's going to grow up to be like chuan.  then we saw this CUTE baby duckling!  OMG!  it was so cute.  =D  then we were at this place, and there were these freaky bugs on this leaf.  we all thought it was like a siamese twin thing, cuz when we poked at it, it didn't move apart and it was sluggish and it was just... there.  so Jack was like, "I want to pick that up!"  so he got some leaves and he was just tightening this hold on it when it MOVED.  it flew and it turned out that it was actually two bugs!  and jack was like, -spring back- "WHOA IT'S TWO BUGS!  AND IT FLYS!  I'm not touching that thing!"  then about 10 steps later we realized that the bugs were probably mating.  -____-;;  so then we keep on trekking.  and then we reach this FIELD of hornet nests.  holy crap.  if we did a vietnam/south korea war movie, that was THE setting.  there were all these gnats and flies and mosquitoes and there was ALL THIS BRUSH.  and hornet nests like mad!  and all these wasps flying around, and bees, and it was just a nightmare.  we were tiptoeing around trying not to disturb anyone.  then we reach this bend and we're like Ooookay NO WAY are we continuing through all that brush.  I mean, this was like uncharted territory.  no litter, even!  and then we had to get across this tree thing, cuz there was concrete on one side and a drop on the other, so somehow we had to balance on the tree roots to keep going.  so I went first, and I almost slip and fall, so I make jack hold my hand while I jump down.  then he comes after me and he almost trips and push us both into the water.  but of course, I grabbed his shirt.  haha.  so then we have to get across the creek to the rocky side.  so I was like, "there's a stepping stone path!"  but then when I step down into the water [after climbing through this little hole thing and almost slipping and falling on my butt into the water], I realize it's that quicksand thing that isn't very solid at all.  so my shoes and socks are all wet, and jack's like I'm not going down into that.  so then he backtracks a bit and there's this peninsula thing with about this three feet strip of creek.  and he was like, "I don't think I can jump across that."  so then I get into the water and move this 10-pound rock into the middle of that little strip of water, and he just steps across.  and I'm like damn you, jack, cuz I'm all wet and you're all dry.  he says you're awesome, sunshine.  so then we continue on.  [btw, my brother followed me across the water.  but he had sandals on.  i had sneakers on.]  then we reach this HUGE stagnant pond thing.  HOLY CRAP.  there was this one place where it looked SO AWESOME, but at the same time, so gross.  I whish I could have taken a picture of the place.  it was so cool.  so then because of the stagnant water, we had to like... slide along the rocks while grabbing onto various tree roots to get across the place.  [on the other side of the creek was more brush.]  so then we're like -whew-.  and then we're in this big clearing of rocks, and we realize we're in that area behind that tree that we had to hid behind for that one scene!  so we go to our movie place, and it turns out other ppl have been there since we were last there because all that ant dirt was cleared away.  and they wore down my foothold.  geez.  then we're about to go up when we find BLACKBERRIES!  so we go blackberry picking down in there.  but then it's impossible to get up to the top along that rock wall thing.  well, except jack got up.  cuz he's jack.  and I had to hold the blackberries.  grr.  and there were bigger fish!  it was so awesome.  so then I walk all the way across [across the little waterfall!  not the rapids], and I get up after a long while.  and only using one had to hold onto stuff b/c I had to hold the blackberries.  so it was hard!  and then when I got up, jack was still helping my brother up.  then we start the long walk back.  we're like, wow.  we could have walked that distance on the sidewalk in like 5 minutes, but we spend more than an hour down there.  and we're all sweating like heck.  so then we get back and jack plays piano for us.  wow.  he's so good.  and he's like, "I practiced yesterday because I knew you guys were gonna come over today."  hahahahaha.  it was so funny.  and he said it in chinese, too.  heavily accented chinese.  so then jack stephen and I go play worms.  I'm happy to say that I owned them.  I won so many games...  lol.  and I didn't know how to play, either!  my team name was humanities, and my worms' names were sartre, kierkegard, wright, pei, warhol, and some other names I forgot.  jack did sicknesses.  my brother was just strange.  man, worms is so fun.  SOOO fun.  =)  and then while we were playing worms, his mom showed my mom this CD from this composing class jack took when he was nine or something.  I got to hear nine-year-old!jack talk!  it was soooo cute.  and HE WAS SO GOOD, EVEN AT NINE.  and he played his own compositions!  holy crap.  beyond good.  and 15-year-old!jack was so embarrassed.  lol.  and then we had to go home.  =(  and I found out that jack WAS planning to go to six flags, and the only reason he didn't go was because of chuan.  I'm super pissed at chuan now.  for being such a freaking ninny.  god.  i wanted to kill him.  I still do.  this is the maddest I've ever been at him.  anyway.  then I found out that jack tells his parents a ridiculous amount about me.  probably even more than i tell my parents about him.  which is quite a bit.  no jack stories?  alrighty then.  jack is going to learn chinese this summer cuz his parents are like "sunshine knows chinese!" and jack's like "sunshine knows chinese!"  it's so hilarious.    =)

I gotta get up at 8 today.  =(  I'm going to be one sleep deprived child.  BUT... notes!  if you want notes, just get them from me.  =)  I make very nice notes.  jack makes horrible notes.  I was talking to jennifer chang today, and I was letting her study using my and jack's notes, and she was like, [pointing to jack's] "whose is this?"  'jack sun.'  "oh.  figures."  hahahaha.  he's been spreading his notes.  -__-;;  oooh, well.  SWEET SWEET SLEEP!

      yearbooks today!  yesterday, I SWORE I would go to sleep before 11.30.  but then jack got online, and I remembered there was something I had to tell him, except I couldn't remember what it was I had to tell him!  So I spend inordinate amounts of time trying to thim of what it was, but, alas, no succes.  so stayed up til 12.30 talking to him, but still... nothing.  At which point I go, "SHOOT!  it's past midnight!" and I scramble offline and into bed.  but then I realize!  oh no!  commapps speech!  so I scramble up and I practice.  and I stay up til 1.30.  by which time I'm about ready to just drop to sleep right there.  then I got up at 7.30 this morning so I could go pick up my yearbook and not wait in those horrendously long lines.  so I was at school by 8, so I just breezed through yearbook pickup.  =)  man.  yearbooks are so thick.  and SUCH an ugly cover.  geez.  all of rice's were better than THIS.  and then commapps... I got a 95 on my speech.  I am never practicing for a speech ever again in my life.  my shoes were killing me, too.  god.  commapps is just so horrible.  so now I have no more stress this week!  just tomorrow, art project due [no biggie], the a FUN-FILLED WEEKEND!  =DDD  which means I'll hafta finish [or at least do most of] my life lesson book tomorrow, and tonight I'll have to go get a shawl.  joy!

I didn't even start my homework yet!  here's what I've been doing since I came home from school.  got home!  was SOOOO tired.  so I slept!  =)  easy solution.  mother got home.  didn't want to eat.  slept some more.  mother and brother went out to eat.  brought me back food.  =)  dad came home.  said to my mom, "let's go shopping!"  (my mom wants a new purse.  the purse she wants is $700.  I was like WHOA why don't you just get this happy pink purse for $15?  she said no, it's too teenagerish and tacky.)  so I was like, can I go along? I didn't do any hw yet, but pleeeaaase?  and they were like eh okay sure why not.  so we went shopping!  at stonebriar AND willow bend.  mom found out purse too expensive.  then she found these coupons that she had for bath and body works!  one of then was get a free lotion thing with the purchase of anything in the store. another one was get $10 off if you spent more than $35, or get $15 off when you spend more than $50. then there was this in store thing where if you buy 3 things, you get a fourth one free. and another in store offer of when you spend $35, you can get a $24 satchel thing for $5.  so what did we do?  why, we combined all those offers, of course!  we got SUCH a nice clerk person.  =)  first my mom was going for the $10 off $35 purchase thing.  so we got these two cotton blossom things.  and then I got a sheer freesia lotion thing!  =)  then the clerk was like =O if you get one more thing, you can get another free!  (for the buy 3 get 1 free thing.)  so my mom was like, eh, sure, whatever.  yang, go pick out two more things.  so I got the cotton blossom lotion and a cotton blossom body spray.  then the lady was like you got more thatn $35 worth of stuff, do you want a satchel for $5?  and my mom was like okay sure whatever.  then the clerk was like you're almost at $50!  if you get some more stuff, you can get $15 off!  so my mom was like o__O oookay then.  so then we got a cotton blossom soap.  -_____-  so in the end, we spent $37 and got over $70 worth of stuff.  -_______-  and I did no homework!  puahahaha.  =D

       In honor of Harry's birthday and all, you know...  xp     1) Your HP nickname: don't really have one... do have a handle for ffn, but am definitely not sharing.  2) Do you write fanfiction: this really drunken H/D fic.  And of course the L/J fic of doom.  3) Draw fanart: a bit too much, I think.  (but nothing of quality...)  4) Review much: not really.  5) Read too many fics: Moderate, I think.  6) Favorite house: Gryffindor.  (Harry, Herm, Lily, James, Sirius, Remus... what's to hate??)  7) Favorite Gryffindor student: Lily.  =D  Then James/Harry (tie), then Sirius, then Herm, then... yeah.  8) Favorite Slytherin student: Like, Millicent, DUH!  9) Favorite Ravenclaw student: Luna.   10) Favorite Hufflepuff student: Huffys don't really register in my mind...  11) Favorite teacher: I   12) Favorite overall character: Harry.   13) Favorite adult: Remus.  (closely followed by McGonagall.  then Dumbledore.)  14) Canon/fanon Draco: Canon.  Fanon's more fun, though.  15) Canon/fanon Snape: Canon.  16) Voldemort or Dumbledore: Dumbledore.  17) Cho, annoying or not: YES.  GET AWAY FROM HARRY.  Shipping:  18) Your OTP: HARRY/HERMIONE, DUH.  And L/J, but they've already happened.  I LOVE HARRY/HERMIONE.  IF HERMIONE ENDS UP WITH RON I WILL JILT CANON AND JUST LIVE IN FANON.  19) Other ships you sail: Fred/Angelina, H/D, D/Hr, D/G, G/Seamus, G/Neville, G/Colin, R/L, S/Arabella, S/L, McGonagall/Dumbledore, R/Squid.  =D  20) Intriguing ships: H/D, D/Hr, D/G.  (Draco seems to be very intriguing.)  21) Underimpressive ships to me: Snape/H.  (Snarry... LOL.)  Snape/Hr.  22) Hated ships: HARRY/GINNY.  RON/HERMIONE.  23) Het, slash or femmeslash: Het.  Slash or femmeslash if they're good.  24) H/Hr or R/Hr: H/Hr.  Sadly, canon is so tilted toward R/Hr that it's amazing it's not upside-down yet.  25) D/Hr or D/G: D/G.  Cute.  26) H/D or H/SS: H/D.  27) Older gen, younger gen or cross-gen: Just not cross-gen.  Fanfiction: (no more shipping..?  **tear)  28) Canon or AU: Well-written.  Not totally AU, though.

No deathfic.  30) Darkfic: As long as no deathfic.  31) OOC or IC: IC.  Duh.  32) SuddenlyVeryPowerful!Harry: Unless it's Mage!Harry from PoU, no thanks.  33) One-shot or chaptered: Chaptered.

Extremely well written slash.  36) Drabbles: Doesn't satisfy.  37) SuddenlyVerySexy!Draco: *hysterics*  38) Fanfiction Pet Peeves: OOC. Bad grammar.  No commas.  No paragraphs.  No voice.  Lack of complex-sentences.  No character development.  No plot development.  No plot, period.  Ignoring parts of canon.  AKA 99.9% of HP fics out there.  39) Canon or Fanon: both.  40) Many ships in one fic: Yes.  Books:  (dunno what happened to 41-58...)  59) Cried for Cedric: No.  60) Cried for Sirius: No. I felt horrible for Harry, though, and I did almost want to cry when he smashed the mirror.  61) Dark or Light Side: Light.   62) Did the explanation of the prophecy satisfy you: No.  63) Which character(s) needs some more development: Lily and James.  Fanart:  64) Favorite artist(s): Me!  No, not really.  Yethro, definitely.  Don't know that many American HP artists.  65) Favorite drawing style: Personally, half-realistic half-cartoon/anime.  But that's just what's easiest for me.  Am leaning more toward realistic, I think.  I can't draw a full anime character for you anymore, at any rate.  Like, thin neck big eyes small body big head... no.  66) Love fanart of: MWPP, Trio, H/Hr, L/J.  67) Fanart Pet Peeves: uhh... ugly art?  68) Stick art: Unless super-cute, generally ick.  69) Shiny: I like shiny things...  but not really that shiny type of CG.  Looks fake.  70) Anime/Manga style: it's cute.  71) Realism:   72) Cartoon: Not really into American cartoon drawing style.  73) Gen or shipped: both.  Misc.:  74) Blaise's gender: -________-  what about transvestite?  75) Tom Riddle's eye colour: Prussian blue.  =D  76) Luna fan: Love Luna.  77) OC's, done or not done: Generally, not.  78) Liking Weasley ships with 'Flame' or 'Fire' in the name: Not really...  79) Weasley love:   80) Malfoy love: Why not.  81) Potter love:   82) Is Lucius really 49: o__0.  83) Brilliant ship name (Don't need to ship it, though!): I think the one that most made me laugh was LARDASS: 'Lavender and Ron Deserve a Shot Shippers'. :D HMS Cliche for Snape/Lily was amusing, too.  (this was someone else's answer... but I like it.  =D)  84) Plain stupid ship name: Good Ship.  God.  Orange Crush, too.  (Pumpkin Pie is pretty stupid, too, but hey, not about to bash my own ship.)  85) Voldemort. Bald. Yes or no: Huh?  86) The power He-Knows-Not and the power that saved Harry is: Love, friendship.  87) Your view on Hufflepuff-ies: Scram.  88) Should Ron say 'Bloody Brilliant' more then once? What the crap?  89) Hermione. Pretty. Am I right?: Yes, but not in the Emma Watson way.  More subdued.  90) Best HP fanfic ever: PoU.  91) Rec the 2nd best, too: Liked Come Together (though unfinished...), Crossroads, and I'm sure lots of other fics that I've forgotten.  92) Did HP change your life dramatically: Ooooh yeah.  93) Marauders. Like or dislike:   94) Prongs, Moony, Padfoot or Wormtail: MWPP preferred, but James.  =DDDD  95) Could Lily have been an animagus too: A bit too neat of a package if she was, so no.  96) What animal Lily would've been: Something like Hedwig.  97) Did Harry pass his Potions' O.W.L.s: No, but it'll all sort out... because he's Harry Potter, of course.  98) Did Ron: Don't really care.  99) Is Harry going to die or will he survive: Live.  100) What gives you the most warm fuzzies in your stomach in the whole HP-verse: That last scene in SS.  Where he wins the House Cup for Gryffindor.

      So.&nbsp; Got my schedule...   French Gould (always a nice way to start off the morning, eh?)  PE (nothing better)  Chemistry Biguenet (a class I'm actually looking forward to)  H. Geog Roelofs (god save me)   Precal Fischer (dreading it)  Art Garrison (had this teacher in fifth grade... remember Mrs. Lynch, Yini?)  W Hist Forgot (can't believe I don't know who my teacher is)  English Kean (never have, do, or will like english)   JOY!&nbsp; -___-   Blogger says I've blogged a total of&nbsp;36 thousand something words on this blog.&nbsp; That's some interesting stuff there.&nbsp; It also says I have 94 posts on this blog.&nbsp; That's less than one thousand words per post.&nbsp; That's not even a picture per post.&nbsp; (hahaha funny joke, eh?&nbsp; okay I guess not.)   So my NEW GOAL is...   at least one thousand words per post!   And how will I know when I've reached one thousand words?   Why, Microsoft Word, of course!&nbsp; Hahaha.   ...so far, am only at 100-something words.   Okay, perhaps I change my mind.&nbsp; One thousand words is obviously biting off way more than I can chew right now.&nbsp; Maybe once school starts and I can fill this thing up with gossip.   ...HA!&nbsp; Like anyone gossips to me.   Anyway.&nbsp; In other news.   I was talking with Jackie today during Driver's Ed, and I was like, "Jackie, the girl sitting right beside me is blatantly cheating!"   And I know because during the final exam, half her answers were blank (yes, that means I looked, but I was done and I was freaking bored).&nbsp; PLUS, she can't even freaking spell!&nbsp; She spelled "shoes" as "shose", and "execute" as "xcute".&nbsp; I was like, that doesn't even work out phonetically!&nbsp; And somehow she got a 106.&nbsp; PSH.&nbsp; Please.   Anyway.&nbsp; Digressing.&nbsp; So then Jackie was like, "So?&nbsp; Everyone cheats."   So of cooouuurse... I asked her about the top ten at Jasper!   "Jackie," I started off, "do you think the top ten at Jasper cheats?"   And she replied (quite belligerently, too... even though I don't know what that word means.&nbsp; Take what it means by its sound, not by its meaning, if that makes sense.), "Why of course they cheat!&nbsp; Well, not Kailing, because she's just too good for that, but everyone else."   Then I just sat there blinking at her, and she was blinking at me, and then she said, "Oh!&nbsp; You're in the top ten, aren't you?!"&nbsp; And I was thinking, "Hmm."   Speaking of which, I was supposed to meet her on mIRC.&nbsp; oops.   And then she told me that Erin Yu cheated by changing her scantron (as in after the teachers handed the scantrons back, she changed her answers and told the teacher the scantron misread it).&nbsp; I never even knew you could do that.&nbsp; I mean, I've never even THOUGHT about doing that.&nbsp; (Yes, I've thought about cheating, but then I figured, "No way I could do it.&nbsp; I have a horrible poker face."&nbsp; Hahaha just joking.&nbsp; -___-)   Now.&nbsp; About my day.  I woke up at 11.30 in a panic because I was supposed to go watch Ella Enchanted with Jackie at 12!&nbsp; So I got up and checked my caller ID, but she hadn't called.&nbsp; So I was like, "Whew!"&nbsp; But then 1010 called, and she told me to call Ning for her, so my phone line was tied up for like half an hour.&nbsp; By then it was neeeaaarly 12, but not quite.&nbsp; So then someone rings my doorbell!&nbsp; I wasn't dressed yet!  So I hurry up and throw on whatever I could reach and went to answer the door.&nbsp; My lazy brother was in the master bedroom watching TV, fully dressed and awake since 9.&nbsp; Geez.  And lo and behold, it was Jackie!&nbsp; And she was like, "Wanna go watch Ella Enchanted, Sunny?"&nbsp; And I was in a panic, calling my mom (thankfully she let me go) and getting money.&nbsp; So I went in my raggedy clothes and unkempt hair and all.  We were supposed to watch Ella Enchanted, but it was 12.15 by the time we got there and there was a HUGE line, and the tickets were sold out, so we were just like what the heck, let's watch Mean Girls.&nbsp; So that's what we did.  I'd already watched it before (on the last day of school with Kailing!), so I just watched the purses of everyone throughout the entire movie.&nbsp; Regina George and Cady both have Louis Vuitton purses.&nbsp; Regina's is the pattern with the cherry blossoms on them, while Cady's is just the colorful one.&nbsp; They're both the same style, too.&nbsp; Ridiculously expensive ($475 w/o tax) and ridiculously small (8in x 5in x 1in, if that).&nbsp; Anyway.  And then after the movie was done, I realized that all the KDers would be there.&nbsp; And lo and behold, I saw Jack Wang as I was walking out.&nbsp; I was like =OO Jackie, stay in here with me!&nbsp; And she was like, "Why?&nbsp; It's just Jack."&nbsp; And I was like, "Nooooooo..."&nbsp; So finally we exited the thatre through the back and had to wait in the little alleyway until Jack went away.&nbsp; Jackie was keeping watch for me.&nbsp; There were lots of insects back there.&nbsp; But still better than a confrontation with Jack Wang.  So then Jackie tried calling Jason to come pick us up, but he wouldn't pick up the phone!&nbsp; Turns out he was asleep... So finally we walked to Mei Hua and waited for Jackie's mom to pick us up.&nbsp; The movie was over at 2.20; Jackie's mom came for us at 3.&nbsp; Now I want to watch Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.&nbsp; Anyone want to accompany me?  Then just muddled around, chatted, played neopets, until driving, and now I'm here.  Btw, GO KERRY.&nbsp; An okay speech, not the best, but an COLLOSAL mistake in the middle.&nbsp; It was supposed to be "anti-terrorist" (something about building up resistance to terrorists, and stuff like that), and he said "terrorist".&nbsp; -___-  Off to read Bourne Identity now.&nbsp; =D  Toodles.  Word count: 1000.

      It's July 26, the day I have been dreading (and anticipating, in some odd way) for more than two months.  Schedule pickup.&nbsp; Isn't that just a horrible thing?&nbsp; You get your schedule... and it's going to be dictating my life for a good part (if not all) of my life until the blissful last day of school waaaay far off in May 2005.  I don't want to get my schedule (for obvious reasons), but then a part of me can't wait to get back to the grind of things and Jasper and competition and all that homework.&nbsp; I'm sure that once school starts, I'll remember every single reason I hated it so much last year, but I'm still looking forward to the beginning of this school year.&nbsp; I know roughly where I stand in the strange heirachy of school (or the Asian part, at least), and I'm comfortable with it.   However , I don't want to see everyone's reaction to my short hair.&nbsp; Or shorter, anyway.&nbsp; My mom still thinks it's too long.  It's totally unfair that it's harder for an Asian to get into a good college than it is for anyone else.&nbsp; But I won't expound on the subject; I'll just refer any interested parties to Yini's blog.  &nbsp;  But onto happier things.&nbsp; Somewhat happier, anyway.  I went to Lisa's house with Jack yesterday after not being able to decide on which movie to watch.&nbsp; So instead, we all gathered and watched One Hour Photo and ordered pizza from Pizza Hut and played more ping-pong.&nbsp; Jack is very good at ping-pong.&nbsp; He can slam like no other.&nbsp; I never get the slams.&nbsp; There is now an orange dent in Lisa's wall.&nbsp; It's kind of funny.  Lisa gave me handsoap from Bath and Body Works.&nbsp; (Pearberry scent for anyone who wants to know; I highly recommend it.)&nbsp; It was for my birthday, but she kept forgetting about it.&nbsp; It can be for my 1/3 birthday.  One Hour Photo is disturbing.&nbsp; In this one scene, Sy is makes two people have sex while he's holding a knife and a camera.&nbsp; It's... interesting.&nbsp; If anyone wants to know what happens, leave a comment.  &nbsp;  I drove on the highway today.&nbsp; It was... boring.&nbsp; This one time, I think I was signaling left but I actually turned right... hahahaha.&nbsp; Anyway.  &nbsp;  &nbsp; I'm writing a Lily James fic with Kailing right now.&nbsp; It's very cute.&nbsp; I have actually started on it!&nbsp; I like it.&nbsp; C=&nbsp; It is going to become legendary.&nbsp; Because it was made by two resident members of the three-member Legendary Co.&nbsp; But then schoolwork will kick in and it'll be stopped right when it's getting to the good part.&nbsp; AKA when Lily and James are just about to make up (and out).&nbsp; Legendary Co. is also a very evil company.&nbsp; Just watch.&nbsp; In twenty years (or less), it will be taking Wall Street by storm.&nbsp; So you'd better invest in it asap.  My brother's watching Shrek 2 right now.&nbsp; Illegal, of course.  EVERYONE TO READ THE BOURNE SERIES.&nbsp; I CANNOT RECOMMEND IT ENOUGH.&nbsp; OOOOH MY GOD I LOOOOOVE JAMES BOURNE.

      To all you single children out there, you guys are the luckiest damn people in the world.&nbsp; I envy you and your singleness.&nbsp; And your attention.&nbsp; And your birthright to a less stressful existance than mine. &nbsp; I hate my brother.&nbsp; So much.&nbsp; I can't even begin to describe it in words.&nbsp; (Later I will read this post and realize what a stupid, selfish bitch I'm being right now, but that's later.) &nbsp; It's just a petty jealousy issue, I suppose.&nbsp; And I'm going to sound so conceited and arrogant for writing such things, but you know what?&nbsp; If I can't write it out in a blog, then where can I express it?&nbsp; (A real diary, I know, but I'm too lazy to handwrite the whole entry out.)&nbsp; So this will just have to suffice. &nbsp; Why do parents always dote on the younger sibling?&nbsp; Why do they think the older one is just automatically more capable of taking care of himself?&nbsp; Just because we came into being first doesn't mean we're in any less need of their attentions.&nbsp; Yes, this whole thing is just around an attention issue.&nbsp; I'm an idiot.&nbsp; An insecure one, at that. &nbsp; I could go into incruciating detail, but then you'll probably just despise me more, so I won't. &nbsp; I also hate Jack with a passion right now, so if you could not mention his name around me, it'd be much appreciated. &nbsp; And don't even ask about that one. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On a brighter note: I drove today!&nbsp; With the driving school instructor.&nbsp; I actually had to drive on a REAL ROAD at 40mph.&nbsp; I was scared out of my wits. &nbsp; Yini: Buttercup and Wesley!&nbsp; Very cute.&nbsp; I approve.&nbsp; Picture takes an eternity and a half to load, though. &nbsp; Meng: I don't know how you manage to stay sane with a younger brother. &nbsp; Kailing: You lucky goose.&nbsp; You ought to be dressed and paraded about. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And that's the end of that.

      I've always preferred Newsweek, just because I've always had it.  But since maybe a month ago, I've wondered: Is Newsweek better, or is Time better?  You see, it bothers me to no end that there is a chance that the news I'm reading every week [the only news I read every week] might not be the best in the market.  So I've been debating about signing up for Time magazine for a while now [oh, and also because they have better covers... generally speaking].  But then yesterday, I read the Newsweek article on the Johns.  And I found out that Newsweek is a Democratic publication.  Now, I can safely say that I adore Newsweek.  Especially the Perspectives page.  Although I do admit that I like looking at the Newsmakers, too.  Especially that little red bar right under the word "Newsmakers", because they always have some interesting tidbit under there.  This week's was" $3.6 million   The amount Johnny Depp paid for his own island in the Bahamas.  Now, that is some stuff I could probably live without knowing, but knowing it makes my life a bit sparklier.  I like sparkly lives.  Plus, I like looking at the Tip Sheet.  There's some pretty interesting stuff on there.  However, the Newsweek articles always seem to be more... immature than the ones in Time.  The voice always seems to be more casual and not so news reporty like.  Which can be a good or bad thing.  Haven't decided which yet.  My favorite political cartoon of all time came from Newsweek this week.  It's positively hilarious.  I laughed out loud when I first read it.  There is a couple watching the TV.  On TV are Kerry and Edwards hugging each other.  Rather enthusiastically.  And grinning like idiots.  And the woman says to the man, "Maybe we should ban same sex running mates."  Now, that's just genius.  Okay, that's it for the magazine stuff.  I don't think I'll post the rest of what happened at Lisa's house... basically cuz all we did was sit down, watch spirited away (oh, yeah, we also got a decent picture taken...), eat, watch spirited away extras, and play more pingpong.  Volunteering tomorrow!  And Friday!  And Saturday!  And next Friday!  And next next Friday!  And next next Saturday!  And Eileen wants to volunteer with me!  And she's going to find us volunteer opportunities!  And she wants me to go over!  Yay!  I

      Which was yesterday, yes, I know, but I can still write about it now, can't I?  Of course.  =)  So I went over at 1.30 even though I wasn't supposed to go until 2 because my brother had a math class at 2.  Anyway, got there, and the first thing Lisa tells me is that Jack isn't coming until three.  I wasn't much surprised.  One, because it's Jack and he's always late, no matter what, and two, it's just too much to hope for.  Because he's Jack.  Sun.  Do I make my point?  Yes.  So I went inside, and we just bummed around for five minutes trying to figure out what to do.  Then Lisa exclaimed, "Let's make pancakes!"  So of course we did.  A number of circumstances made for our downfall:  1) Faulty recipe.  One cannot do much of anything with a faulty recipe.  But then again, we chose the faulty recipe.  Darn. 2) No ingredients.  Lisa needs to go grocery shopping.  Soon.  I think that says it all. 3) No measuring utensils.  We had to approximate a teaspoon, a cup, and a liter.  And considering not all of those are standard measurements, imagine the fun we had.  Plus Lisa kept insisting that she knew what proper pancake batter looked like, so she kept on adding in bits of milk and water when I wasn't watching. 4) No appliances.  I got to hand beat the batter while Lisa ate her Korean barbeque.  Not much fun.  I do not envy those pioneer women.  The lumps are my worst enemy. 5) Stove would not turn on.  Lisa has a gas stove.  It's a temperamental gas stove.  Oooh, boy. 6) We did not know how to flip pancakes.  So they turned out half raw, half burned.  Burned because we also didn't know how to tell when the pancakes were done. 7) No syrup.  One knows that one cannot eat pancakes without syrup.  So instead, we ate it with Vietnamese spring roll sauce.  Pretty interesting.  Then three rolled around.  It's amazing how fast time passes when you're screwing something up.  Jack still didn't come.  I anticipated that, of course.  We were supposed to go to the mall to watch Terminal, but since I didn't really want to anymore and Lisa didn't really want to anymore, either, (we were having too much fun screwing up without getting a screwed up grade for it) plus her parents had to go to the airport to pick someone up.  So when Jack finally got there at around 3.30, I was still trying to make pancakes (Lisa and I figured out that if the pancake is thinner, it's more edible) and Lisa was telling him (not so) regretfully that we couldn't go watch Terminal.  But at that time, he realized he forgot to bring money, so it was a moot point anyway.  Then we gave up on the pancakes, and Jack and I went to play ping pong while Lisa tried to save her walls from Jack's rage.  I was facing the windows, and she didn't seem to care as much for her window blinds as she did for her wall.  It was a pretty interesting ping pong game.  Jack was near the bin of ping pong balls, and since we're both lazy bums who would rather not stoop over to pick up the balls every time it got hit out of the game (which was a lot of times and quite often, to boot), he just served a new ball.  So in the end, we had about 25 balls rolling around the place and the two of us too lazy to pick them up.  So poor darling Lisa catered balls for a while.  Then I dunno, Jack got mad or wanted to show off or something, because he started hitting those Chinese hard balls.  And he always hit them across the table to my right, which is my weak side, and so I never got them and they always hit the wall.  Poor Lisa was so worried.  Plus she was trying to get a picture of us, but we wouldn't hold still.  Will post rest later, as must go study SAT now.  Btw, Yini, stop laughing at me.  I swear, you abuse my friendship so much...  =(  Meng!  I finally have another blog to read!

      I forgot about this thing, and so now I have seven minutes in which to post before I forget to post in yet ANOTHER day.  Twice in one week... unthinkable!  Anyway, actually interesting stuff today.  I asked my mom if I could go to Lisa's house on Saturday from 2-8pm to 1) watch The Terminal 2) bake something 3) play ping pong 4) watch Spirited Away and 5) cook ourselves dinner.  I asked her while she was in the shower today while I was scrubbing her back for her, so she was in a relatively good mood.  Her first reaction was, of course, "For fun or for study?"  And since I NEVER lie, I said, "For fun."  Then she said, "For six hours?!"  And I was like, "Yeah..."  Shifty look here.  Then I tacked on, "I'll wash the dishes right now!"  And she conceded.  =))))))  Then later tonight she was like, "So who else is going to Lisa's house?  Surely not just you, right?"  And I said, of course, being ever so truthful as I am, that no, Jack was going, too.  And that was my big mistake.  My mom gave this really scary laugh, and said, "Ah ha!  So that's why you want to go.  This is a meeting with Jack!"  Then I said, "Mom, if this was really a meeting with Jack, I wouldn't have told you he was going..."  But she didn't listen (or the words just went in one ear and out the other), and she kept ranting about how I liked Jack.  It's scary how well my mom knows me, I think.  But now I am so ooover him and I can tell her truthfully that she is off her rocker.  =D  Wow, that was some fast typing there.  Even ignored all the flashy AIM buttons.  I'm so proud of myself.  For the record, this post was started (as in I typed in the title) at 11.51 pm and it is now 11.57 pm.  Six minutes!  Not bad.

      I have forgotten to update last night.  I am shamed and depressed.  Oh, how will I ever be forgiven?  I shan't.  Oooooooh, shaaaame!  I have nothing better to do than to play neopets all day.  This is so sad.  Jackie taught me mirc yesterday, but I'm too lazy to go and get it.  How sad is that?  Too lazy even to get manga to read.  I'm a saaad sad person.  I'm too lazy to even write long blog entries.  Even for my bestest friends!  I'll probably write more when school starts.  And I have more interesting things to write about.  Other than being bored.  Yes.  So, taa, everyone!

      I'm back!  Again!  And for good this time, I hope.  =)  Actually, yes, because I am going to driving school tonight!  Wow, I have a buuuuuusy schedule!  Would some kind soul tell me what books are on the reading list for tenth grade?  I seem to have misplaced my sheet.  Well, DC was fuuun.  =)  My favorite part: Holocaust Memorial Museum!  Man, that thing was so freaking awesome.  And there was a special exhibition called "Deadly Medicine"... so cool.  I love driving on the fourth of July.  There are NO CARS on the highways.  It took us almost 24 hours to drive to DC on a non-fourth day, and it only took us 21 hours to drive back!  How awesome is that?  Plus, we got to watch fireworks on the drive back!  =DDD  Now, I will go catch up on a 5-week break from Internet and all things holy (which would be Internet).

      I have such horrible commitment.  I think I'm going to have committment issues when I grow up.  Yes.  Anyway.  I am going to recount everything I got during tax-free weekend because 1) I want to 2) it makes me feel organised when I am admittedly and irrevocably v. disorganised in my life, school and otherwise, right now, and three 3) I need to feel girly and teenagerish and somehow somewhat convince myself I'm not wasting the best years of my life doing schoolwork.  So, here goes:  1) gap skirt - light orange with some darker pattern all over it - $12.97 2) gap skirt - beige with dark purple flowers and some darker purple design - $12.97 3) gap shirt - beige with white embroidery at the neckline - $6.97 4) gap shirt - pink with NYC written on front with green outlines of skyline - $4.95 5) gap track pants - black with white stripes down the side - $9.97 6) gap shirt - briiight saturated pink, no design - $4.95 7) gap sports bra - for PE  even though I'm never going to wear them... and I'm sure you guys don't need to know this   - $9.97  8) tommy hilfiger shirt - white with this cool zipper thing up the middle - $4.99 9) tommy hilfiger shirt - blue with a left breast pocket with dark blue flowers printed - $7.49 10) banana republic shirt - light pink with no design - $7.78 11) banana republic shirt - blue/black/white/light blue striped - $12.24 12) guess shirt - blue crinkled button down collar shirt - $13.88 13) old navy shorts - grunge pink with lots of cool zipper pockets; 3.5in inseam - $6.97 14) old navy capris - a shade lighter than army green with more zipper pockets and a sash - $9.99  total spent: $126.09 total government should have gotten: $10.40 total government got: $0.00  I feel pretty good.  =)  And $126 for fourteen items isn't that bad.  Average $9 per item.  =)  Okay, now I don't need to go shopping for a long, long time.  -___-  Today I engaged in my first conversation about fat.  With Christina Ch-something.  The only person I know in my PE class.  Spent the time outside running/walking talking about fat.  I never felt so stupid.  Okay, homework time now.  =D  HOSA and French tomorrow, LASER Thursday, and still math club and whiz quiz to join...

      Whatever possessed me to choose so many hard courses has apparently left me, because I think I'm so screwed for the rest of the year that it's not even conceivably funny.  What's even scarier than that is the fact that I'm not even all that worried right now. I mean, by all means, I should be scared out of my wits right now, but I'm not. And I don't know why. I mean, today, when Mrs. Kean (Valliere now) told us that nobody in her previous honors class yesterday has gotten above a 90 for the timed writing, I wasn't even a bit worried.  Maybe I'm getting a big head.  It must be Gabriel and all the classes (four! FOUR!) that I have with him.  Precal was beyond funny today. =D  beD XTC: and all your little gilry friends are there, too  hahahahaha. talking about the A day lunch. I found it funny. =)  9 more pages of WHAP to read, then take notes, then chem, then memorize, then precal. Aaah!  I'm glad I'm back at school. I've missed it. The pressure, the stress, the competition, the procrastination, that sense of triumph you get when you realize you got the highest grade in the entire tenth grade class, the sense of triumph you get when you beat someone you espeically hate, and most of all, getting a good grade for a bsed project.  Ah, high school. There's nothing else quite like it.

      Well, overall, MUCH better than first day of school was last year.  MUCH BETTER.  I got a wireless keyboard and mouse!  So now I can sit on the COUCH and type.  How cool is that?  =D  That also means I can use the space where my keyboard used to go as a writing surface now!  That's even better.  (That's actually why I wanted to get a wireless set... not to sit on the couch and type.  -__-  Though that is a nice bonus.)  Hmm.  Let's go through my day, shall we?  Well, got to school at like... 8.20, laughed at all the marching band people.  Walked inside cafeteria and first thought is, "OMG THERE ARE SO MANY FRESHMEN."  My second thought was, "Die, freshmen, DIE!!"  But lets not get into that.  So then I went to the soph asian table (we're sophomores now!) and I saw Melanie.  She didn't cut her hair.  Liar.  Oh, well, I like short hair so much more than I did long hair.  Then I was like, "What do I do now?  I have no homework... I know where all my classes are... I'm not scared of high school anymore..."  Thank goodness they let us go early.  =)  Then went to look for Mrs. Lewis with Kailing (never found her) and went to go look for Mrs. Wendle (didn't find her, either).  French:  HORRID. But at least Gould can speak French better than Alexander.  People: Ning, Andrew T, Kathryn S, Tavvy, Andrew Chang, Ramon, Leslie H.  Not bad, all in all.  Lunch: I LOVE YOU, YINI.  THANK GOODNESS YOU HAVE ENGLISH SECOND.  PE: I ACTUALLY KNEW PEOPLE.  I was so happy.  We had the choice to dress out or to not dress out and spend the day playing games with the special ed children.  I chose to dress out.  And this is for the rest of the semester.  But then if you do the special ed thing, no time to do hw.  So yeah.  Hw time outside of home is very important.  People: Christina C, Megan S, Angela C (who apparently remembers me from first grade, but I can't remember her...), Jennifer F, Kim.  Not bad, for PE.  =)  Chemistry:  Biguenet's voice is... annoying.  It grates on my nerves.  And I think there was something wrong with our experiment, because we got 5 NRs....  But I heard that happened to lots of other groups, too, so I'm not TOO worried.  Lots of people: Meng, Andrew C, Su, Stacey, Grace Y, Gary, Qin, Ning, and someone else whom I've forgotten...  AP Human Geography:  OH MY GOD.  THIS CLASS...  TOOOO MANY PEOPLE.  There are TWO white people in the entire 36-student class.  Mr. Stanton popped his head in and said, "Oh, boy."  hahahaha.  When I told Roelofs I went by Sunshine, someone started whistling "You Are My Sunshine".  It was... interesting.  People:  Gabriel, Melanie, Grace Y, Grace C, Lisa W, Qin, Katie Y, Jack W, Irene, Amanda S, Alex A, Bing, Didy, Ning, Chuan.  Oh, I made quasi-amends with Chuan.  Figured it'd be easier, as he sits diagonally behind me in GAP.  (Hahahaha.)  Then I came home, and Mrs. Bartley called me.  B: I talked to Mrs Booth, and she said you wanted to continue with orchestra this year.  Is that true? Me: Yes... B: So why'd you drop it? Me: My parents made me.  I had to take PE, or else I wouldn't graduate in time. B: In a perfect world, would you still want to take orchestra? Me: Yes... (I couldn't very well say no...) B: So would you mind if I go talk to you counselor? Me: No, of course not.  (YES, YOU CRAZY WOMAN, YES.) B: So if we could work something out, would you be willing to join orchestra again? Me: Sure.  (NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO...) B: Because we always have a spot for you in our orchestra family.  You're a really valuable member. Me: Alright.  (I DON'T WANT TO BE A PART OF YOUR "ORCHESTRA FAMILY".) B: Okay, I'll see what I can do tomorrow, then. Me:  Okay!  (NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO....) B: Bye, then! Me: Bye!  (FINALLY.)  NO WAY AM I EVER GOING BACK TO ORCHESTRA.  NO FREAKING WAY.  Anyway.  I'm calm.  Really.  Shorter posts now that school's started.  Will of course, post everyday from now on, though.  =)
