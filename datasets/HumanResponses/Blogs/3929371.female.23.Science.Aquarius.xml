      Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;  I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.  The evil that men do lives after them;  The good is oft interred with their bones;  So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus  Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:  If it were so, it was a grievous fault,  And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.  Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest -  For Brutus is an honourable man;  So are they all, all honourable men -  Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.  He was my friend, faithful and just to me:  But Brutus says he was ambitious;  And Brutus is an honourable man.  He hath brought many captives home to Rome  Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:  Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?  When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:  Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:  Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;  And Brutus is an honourable man.  You all did see that on the Lupercal  I thrice presented him a kingly crown,  Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?  Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;  And, sure, he is an honourable man.  I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,  But here I am to speak what I do know.  You all did love him once, not without cause:  What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?  O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,  And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;  My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,  And I must pause till it come back to me.

      Ok. Maybe qualifying something from Shakespeare as an official blog is way too much to ask. But isn't it a nice o'l speech, eh? And a fitting one, at that, for my hopefully rewarding dip into the world of non-private thinking.  A great orator such as Marc Antony tends to make his audience believe that what he is saying is TRUE, regardless of the righteousness of the idea. That 'Friends, Romans, countrymen' speech was immortalized by that very nature -- its  use of rhetoric to affect emotions and spur action in the process.  By posting that speech, I had just imposed upon myself something of a precedent for how things should work around here. I'm not saying I can persuade anyone into action, or lure someone into a pipe dream by my mere soliluquy. All I'm saying is perhaps, my rants, raves, and eternal damnation of the organized majority can be viewed in such light as PURPOSEFUL. Non-censorship of web contents guarantees me freedom for cussing and screwing anything and anyone, but by golly -- be it for some intent other than satisfying myself.  There'd be some sporadic trivial and inconsequential stuff here too, sure, but hey it isn't fun talking about serious matters all the time.  As the great Oscar Wilde oh-so-aptly puts it -- "Seriousness is the only refuge of the shallow."  So, there.  By the way, it took me a while to understand what was behind Marc Antony's speech, so if I were you, I'd go back on that post and read it again. It's beauty and classic appeal had just dawned upon me on my 10th, no make it 15th, intentful re-reading.
