      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yay, the dork convention is in town! I really like anime (as well as pretty much any cartoons, although there are always exceptions) and  urlLink Otakon  is the anime convention in my area.&nbsp;So far it isn't going well, the pants I am having made for my costume are too small (yes, a costume, *sigh* I have been a geek and a dork for ages though). This is what happens when you get custom tailored pants and they don't have them ready until the day you are going! I am going dressed as  urlLink Great Teacher Onizuka  which is currently a favorite of mine.&nbsp;He is a funny but inspirational teacher who used to be a motorcycle gang leader. He is 22 and still a virgin (although I am 23 and not a virgin, I think I might forget how to have sex soon tho! it has been a year and a half!) and wanted to teach high school girls and hit on them but ends up teaching middle schoolers. Anyways, he kicks ass. He has this one tattoo on his arm in some pics (which just says "great&nbsp;teacher Onizuka" in Japanese) which I have been having some trouble to write on my arm. I figure a pen then some marker oughta work! It is hard to write on one of your arms though... especially in Japanese. The fake earrings I got for my costume are hard to put on as well and I might just use some Elmer's glue to put em on ;-P getting them off will be another story though. I already had my hair cut and dyed to look like his.. man, it seems like I am going all out for this! At least my hair is the right color. I came to the conclusion with one discussion with my friend, K (who is my roommate as well), that if you are going to dress up then you might as well go all the way. Thinking outside the box makes me realize that it is silly to dress up this much for a weekend convention, but it is kind of fun to do. I have so much to do today! I must buy beer for tonight because I am staying at a friend's place in Baltimore. My friends J and E live not too far away from the inner harbor where the convention is. I have to pick up my friend T who is travelling with me to the convention, and had his license revoked for too many points (dumbass). At least he gets it back on the 16th! I guess some of his points are coming off. God damn, I hope I can stay awake, this waking up at 5:30 shit is killer on Fridays. Guess Red Bull is in order for later ;-P

      On a side note: The Story about L also should include the information that the car that he messed up is the 4th (or is it the 5th?)&nbsp;one he has had in the past two years..... the others were not so lucky.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I write at work in the morning because I oft' times have no work to do. Which is great and I can read my school textbook, but it is pretty boring. Also, it could put me to sleep and I am pretty sure they frown upon sleeping at your desk here. Let's see what is going on ...  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, my friend A told me that my friend L hurt his brand new car on the highway the other day. Apparently he hit something like a jersey dam and messed up the front of his car. Now, I am not saying he is a dumbass, he truly does have some potential. L is fucking it all up though, because he is a pothead. I don't have anything against pot. I have have never really smoked it myself, and how can you really knock something (that isn't dangerous) that you haven't tried? In L's case however it makes him the most unmotivated person. He doesn't seem to have any hopes and dreams in particular, unless counting smoking the most bomb ass weed a goal. I guess to make in in life we need goals right? I measure myself against what I would like to be and try to make it happen. I wonder if L is happy... He seems happy whenever I would see him. Although I don't see him much anymore, he was also someone who lied a lot. It used to be a joke that we would roll him up after he died and smoke him since a lot of his blood should probably have THC crystals floating around in it. He doesn't really call me anymore, and I don't really call him either. I guess my group of friends just kind of floated away from him. It is kind of sad really. He hangs out with A's brother, who is a couple years younger than us. He started working at the same place as A's brother. A boat shop, and he has never been interested in boating that I have seen.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not sure if I should be analyzing one of my pothead friends when I have lots of other stuff I could be writing about. I am not even qualified, but I guess it doesn't matter since this is just a weblog that very little people will see (probably... I won't rule out future stardom!).  It seems, that me and my other friends have observed, that L will latch onto someone that he wants to hang out with. I would say that he idolizes them. He will hang out with them as much as possible. They will sometimes get sick of him, since he will bring the bad habits of the world to their doorstep. This seems strange to say, but I guess coming to your house in the morning for wake-n-bake is the worst I can think of right now. I guess their are much much worse things than the art of de-motivation. He never hangs out with girls that much so Mary Jane is his main thang. An amusing enigma of a person... a wookie, if you will... for your perusal.&nbsp;

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not sure that I could function working the 7am-3:30pm shift without a cup of coffee in the morning. I am just not a morning person. There are tons of people out there just like me (yeah)! I like the night life, and I am more active when it is past noon. As a tech contractor I don't think there are too many opportunities that have you working the "2nd shift" which is like 11am to 7:30pm. I guess some network admins could probably do that if the servers at the workplace need to be monitored all of the time. When I would write computer code during undergrad, I would write it starting at... like 8 o clock. This is when my mind was focused. Then I could figure out algorithms and format my code with ease! Then I graduated, and found that there were pretty much no tech jobs out there for recent graduates with 4 year degrees in computer science. I applied to the major defense contractors and everything. Even had an interview with Lockheed Martin (or was it Northrop Grumman??).&nbsp; But no...   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, then I partied for a while and celebrated that living at&nbsp;(my parent's)&nbsp;home was free, since I had money saved from my college job I could go out and buy some booze for a while... Then I had to buckle down and absolutely find a job! And I worked hard, and I found a job... as a delivery driver... for little caesars. The pizza was delicious, but I could have been better off not knowing how much grease was in my food. My manager (T), was a bitch, but I guess she kept the business running due to her husband. T was the most unreasonable person when she was angry. And she demanded nothing less than the best from her army of teenagers. Of course, I was 21 and would rather take it easy with little responsibilities. I didn't want to work on the weekends so I could go see my (now ex) girlfriend (She was great, but another whole post could be dedicated to her). Neither the other drivers or T could understand why I wouldn't want to work on the busy time where you made more money (dumbasses). It wasn't about the money for me... it was about sustaining my drinking habit. As long as I had enough to live off of then I didn't care! I even once got yelled at for wearing a stripey shirt underneath my work shirt, because it was too flashy! So, I decidedly quit from there. Put in my two weeks notice, and then took notice as the bitch didn't schedule me for two.. more.. weeks. Then I got this nice job with the help of my sister. I used to work 9am to 5:30pm but that was too late. I need to work from 9am to 3:30pm that would be ideal... but unfortunately I don't see that happening.   Guess I will just stick with the coffee...

      MMMMmmmm, it is my lunch break here at work. I was really hungry, and I see that as the hungrier I get the more my love for food grows. I definitely get lots more food when I am more hungry, usually too much food for me to eat in one sitting. Although, many times this isn't too hard to accomplish since most restaurants give you those big ass portions. Unless you go to nice fancy restaurants where you pay more for less (although it usually is much more tasty). Aside from that, I went to the cafeteria here at work to get my food. I got a&nbsp;tuna salad sub. I got that because it is pretty filling and it is&nbsp;only 4 bucks which is pretty decent&nbsp;around here in downtown DC. &nbsp;The cafeteria charges by the pound of food that you get... 4.49 a pound. It can add up when you are hungry. I had to start&nbsp;balancing it out with half a lunch&nbsp;container of salad since rice and other stuff can jack up the price. It was the difference between a 5 or 6 dollar meal and a 8 or 9 dollar meal. Yes, I am pretty surprised also that I am not fatter than I am. At least when I get the salad (even though today I opted for the sandwich) I can feel healthier.   I think that feeling healthy is important. It is up there with that whole self image thing. Sure women get pounded on by images of impossible to keep up with standards, but a lot of guys do too. Like all of those reality shows that have guys&nbsp;with the really jacked washboard stomachs and man-boobies.&nbsp;They also have those hot sexy bikini wearing phat assed girls.... (where was I going with this....oh yeah) But real people don't look like this. You have to spend more time in the gym than sane 40 hr a week working people have.&nbsp;I guess I mean that people shouldn't starve themselves, they should try to just eat some things that are good for themselves. Like, lettuce isn't the only green out there, and&nbsp;the others are way more healthy for you.&nbsp;People should eat a wide variety of things to balance the shit out, and for God's sake, eat some Carbs! They aren't gonna kill you! Just.. bread with every meal is going to make you fat, be sure to diversify. Fresher foods are much better for you since they don't get preservatives in them (this stuff  shouldn't &nbsp; &nbsp; really be new knowledge for anyone). Oh! and something my roomie seems to not have the grasp of yet.. you don't need to eat everything in front of you either! (don't be wasteful, be sure to pack it up with you)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I, myself, got some peaches at the farmer's market outside because they looked fresh and delicious. And on my way back to my desk, I picked up some Funyuns... because they are too good (and life too short), but they have MSG in them so I don't eat them that often. GodSpeed.

      First off, paper is done! Hooray! I am thinking that procrastination may not be that good, but I will wait until I see the results of the paper that I wrote practically in one day (10 pages) to give my opinion. I know a bit more than I used to about Russia now tho. Did you know that it used to be legal for husbands to beat their wives, and some wives expected to be beaten a little bit every night! I was shocked, but not really, at this revelation. People used to do a lot of pretty shitty misogynistic things. Anyways, it was at least a comfort to read that not many people actually beat their wives a lot in the old days of Russia. Apparently it was mostly a thing that the rich landowning class did! The poorer&nbsp;men had to work with their wives and were much closer to them (not to mention, needed their help around the house), and the rich women were not really even supposed to show their face in public. I also found out that in the old days of Russia you could divorce twice if you wanted to but the women would usually be sent into convents where they had their head shaved and were not allowed to marry again. I thought that such a woman would make a great subject of a movie. But, I am not a writer.  ...paper over = good news  Yeah, well I had another weekend with partying (had to celebrate). I am starting to wonder if I should slow down and not do this every weekend. I mean it does get pretty expensive sometimes. Friday was not that expensive. I went to go see a play at the Arena stage since I had a comp ticket so greatly appreciated from my ex-girlfriend ummm... 'A' I guess I will call her from now on. The play I saw was called Crowns and it seemed to offer an insight to black (African American)&nbsp;culture that I hadn't really seem much of before. I highly recommend it. It is very lively and the singing was teriffic. Saturday after proofreading the paper (or... trying to proofread the paper but actually watching King Ralph on tv), then adding citations to it, I went to Baltimore to visit my friend 'K' who is one of the nicest girls you would want to meet. We went to this art museum by the harbor that had works from people with mental handicaps or startling emotional trauma. It was pretty awesome. One sculpture by this mental patient was an excellent wood carving of himself, but unfortunately he killed himself&nbsp;after being released for 2 years&nbsp;from the mental hospital. Then we ate at a Cuban restaurant called "little Havana" which was nice. Thenn... we came back to her place and got ready to go out on the town. She was soo hot in her cute little outfit. If she wasn't engaged to another friend of mine then I would hit on her ;-P hehe Anyways, we went to this chic little club called  urlLink Red Maple . It had no cover, but the drinks were kind of expensive, which I am used to since DC costs a lot usually. That place looked like the  urlLink Queer Eye  guys ran through there. Then went to  urlLink Coburns  in Canton Square for a little bit of dancing and beer.&nbsp;K and I had a good time. Then her roommate (who was moving out) woke me up in the morning with some vaccuuming yay! nothing like waking up at around 8:30 am after a night of drinking! I would have punched him in the face, but then who would move his shit out... not me. It was fun watching him and his friends struggle with the couch as they tried to get it down the stairs anyways. That guy is an asshole anyways, K told him so, and he will probably get what he deserves someday. He is becoming a doctor I believe, maybe someone will be shoving a needle in his ass sometime soon! We can only hope.

       I have been trying to hide my one pink sock today. I have one pink sock because of a red shirt laundry accident (with cold water no less). It is a funny thought trying to hide it, and I thought I would share.

      So, I have a bird. His name is Conan the Cockatiel. I wanted some manly name for him because I didn't want to be some prissy bird boy. Conan brings to mind visions of Arnold Swarz...(damn, i forgot how to spell his last name) Arnold swinging his sword chopping off peoples head in his "fur I just stripped from a lion" loincloth. And that is the kind of image I want associated with my bird by Krum. And maybe that my bird could be a great late night talk show host.. you know, if he really wanted to be.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I suppose the warrior side of him makes him what he is today, devil spawn! When I bought him offa some other people from the Baltimore area he was the noisiest of a pair. I thought the noisier one would be a better choice, since he should be more lively. But I guess he was just more ... evil than lively, or perhaps both. He is very fussy and doesn't want to do what I want. It is a lot like owning a small feathery pre-teen human. He loves my roommate, who hates the bird. But me, who loves him, he could do without. I feed him and (well, i don't clothe him...) water him and this is the thanks I get? hehehe &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe I should have kept them as a pair? He might need another companion to keep him busy. I just don't want him to be stressed out or anything. He wakes me up sometimes and I want to  kill him!  But I still  love  him.

       I just saw the funniest thing! There was a whole group of blind kids trying to get into my building and of all choices... they decide to come in, of all things,  through the revolving door!  They were getting stuck! They were trying to go in two at a time... one of the helpers had to yell at one of them to get out of the door because he was on the other side! LOL. Nothing brightens my day up more than, yup, you guessed it...  makin' fun o' blind kids ! I will meet the rest of you who also like to make fun of the blind... in hell. hehehehe

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would just like to say that I have at least some power over my friends. That is to say, I have been told that I kind of induce a calming effect on my friends when I hang out around them. My general relaxed attitude seems to help people relax themselves. I think this is true for many people. A general relaxed state (or one of being easygoing) will be contagious to others around you if they are being receptive to it. I have observed it many times. Unfortunately, it can have a vortex effect if you also have easygoing friends. This goes for friends like mine who used to do a lot of pot (and especially while high), where once people start becoming mellow the whole group can sometimes mellow out. This unfortunately turns into one of those situations where   nobody does anything!   So, you get a bunch of people sitting around watching the television who are happy and don't want to do anything in particular, except watch more television. This of course, helps if there is something like... urlLink Weird Science  on TV. Strangely enough I have mostly the opposite effect on my roommate who I seem to just confuse and frustrate. This seems to be some weird science indeed, for the person with whom I live does not get the calming effect. In fact, most of the time our personalities clash. I think he lives with me because I can tolerate him and I am not really that messy. He likes to entertain himself so when he is bored,  look out!  But when he is trying to entertain himself, I also am being mellow and don't really... play along... and this will therefore derive him of his entertainment and hence frustration and confusion.&nbsp; Although, he is one of my friends from college and I have lived with him for about four years (if you count dorm rooms and stuff), so we know each other too well or we are used to it. At least we don't want to kill each other. Because that takes effort, and we are totally against effort. I mean, we are both computer science tech people, and nothing defines us as a people more than "Hey, I am pretty sure that a computer would rather be doing this 'insert manual labor example here' for me". In fact, if we felt like we could invent some electronic killing machine that kills and cleans up after and makes an alibi for the user... then we would be dead already. Or at least my  urlLink bird  would be ;-P.&nbsp;Computers just make everything too easy for me not to be lazy. This is why the US has an obesity problem! Not me, of course, the computer unfortunately does not make my naked body look good in the mirror so I have to go to the gym. Not that I obsess about my self image, I just wanna look good naked. Just like the dad in American Beauty. Ugh... back to work, and that stupid paper.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two different shifts here where I work. One that I have been working is the 7am to 3:30pm shift, and the one I am working today is the 9am to 5:30pm shift. I have been trying to figure out which one is better. I am not really a morning person, at all. It isn't that I am grumpy or anything, I just don't think that my brain works that well in the morning. It works okay in the afternoon, and sometimes even when I stay out late, but the morning is when I like to space out. It reminds me of in "office space" where the main character says that he comes to work and spaces out for about an hour. I kinda do that, but I just slowly read my e-mail, because nobody really ever calls in the morning. If they do it is usually because they forgot the password to login to their machine and can't do anything.&nbsp; You  would think that since people know they have forgotten their password before they would write it down somewhere, but I guess most people think we know their passwords or something. I try to not memorize people's passwords since I have my own to keep track of. (:-P)&nbsp;What was I talking about? Oh, the schedule.... We also have these new schedules that allow for one day off every two weeks if you work 9 hour days (AWS or CWS depending on the people you talk to).&nbsp; We aren't supposed to do this of course. My program manager asked specifically if we could, but our asshole of a government contract manager said we couldn't. S0o, we keep it on the hush. (sshhh don't tell anyone hehe)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think it is funny because these people are gone (not with that much frequency mind you since we only have like... 6 people of which only four ppl are on the AWS/CWS) and we cannot tell anyone it is their day off.&nbsp;Luckily the government workers are not really suspicious or they just don't care enough to see what is happening. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At least with this week I could go out to bars if I wanted. It is hard to go out at night when you get tired at ten o clock. I like the night life baby. Who knows where this will lead me? I certainly don't know at least I will have time to work on my term paper this week. The topic? systems engineering and the system of government, in Russia. It really is interesting when I was researching it. The hard part is making it relate to systems engineering. I figure I can say that Russia's former system of government (a.k.a. communist) failed due to lack of engineering practices in its making, giving away to a systematically created democratic government. Or something like that, it is due Friday so I guess I will see how it turns out! 10 pages, wish me luck!

      Also, on my way home I had my car randomly searched for security purposes. It is at a yellow alert and I don't really see it going down ever. I don't look that suspicious... well, maybe, I am devious. But they can still kiss my ass. I saved the paper they gave me&nbsp;and posted it on my bedrrom door. If I ever scan it I will post it, or try to.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; process of going to work with a hangover is a very difficult one. I went out last night&nbsp;to the Front Page bar, in DuPont Circle. They have the most awesome drink specials, at least... on Thursday (1.75 coronas and miller lites bucket of 6 for $10). Needless to say I drank my fair share. It was my roomie's and one of my other friend's birthday. Since my roomie was on his way back from Thailand I decided to make the beer I drank in honor of my other friend who was actually there. Little did I know picking up my roommate today from the airport would be a saving grace. I was pretty drunk and decided that I would go with my friends to the Big Hunt bar across the street to further celebrate the birthday of my friend. Luckily, she and her roommate had made friends with the bartender there and they could get better discounts (but not me of course, damnit, I don't have any boobs). I had two there, they were Red Hook ESB, which are pretty awesoem. I made it on the metro on time, luckily, because before I downed that last one I couldn't really stand up correctly. I passed out in my bed naked which I hardly ever do,&nbsp;mostly because of morning wood, which if I dont' wear underwear then wakes me up early (what a bitch). But, at least there was a reason for it, because I have to do laundry which requires quarters and I don't have any quarters. &nbsp;&nbsp;When I woke I was really thirsty and got some cereal in my stomach. I was running late until I drove to work, and I got there 25 minutes early. Apparently walking to work kind of ruins my sense of time since it took me like 10-15 minutes to drive there and when I walk it is like... 35. I was going to sit in my car but decided to walk in. I was sitting there the whole morning wanting to be asleep and my stomach feeling weird which is a really&nbsp;crappy feeling (if you have not gone to work hungover before I don't really recommend it). Then 10 o clock came around and I was celebrating in my mind because I got to get off of work to go pick up roomie from Dulles. I was so outta there. My saving grace, got to leave early and I called later and told my program manager that it wasn't worth coming back in and he said I didn't even need to use my leave time! "He is the coolest" in the gushy teenage girl (in the 80s)&nbsp;kind of excited way.&nbsp;Although if I actually behaved like an excited teenage girl from the eighties around anyone, then you have my permission to shoot me. Now recovery time, and time to find quarters.

               "I dunno" seems to be my favorite thing to say when people ask me what I am thinking about. I always have a hard time answering that question. I usually don't want to say what is usually on my mind at that time, because I it is probably something pretty dirty (with my mind "in the gutter") a good amount of the time. Something like "I was kind of thinking about what it would look like if I put your ankles on my shoulders and fucked you really hardcore" isn't really something I picture myself actually saying... and therefore the woman gets... "i dunno" usually followed by an awkward laugh (if my mind actually is in the proverbial gutter).            The reason I bring this up of course is, because this is what I did last night (and it has happened before). I decided to meet this girl who I met online a little while ago and go out to dinner with her. She is a college graduate of the age of 22 and she majored in Japanese, which I think is pretty damn cool because of all of the Japanese animation that I like to watch. So.. I get to the place ( urlLink Sushi-Taro , which is a really good restaurant which I highly recommend if you like sushi/Japanese food) and she is waiting outside. She has a cute face and a round-ish figure, but I am not one to discriminate... much. We go in and have a nice sushi dinner and small bottle of sake (12 oz. is that small?). The conversation is pleasant but we are way better at talking to each other over IM in my opinion. Awkward pauses in the conversation and she is not a loud talker (although she told me she likes talking dirty during sex which I don't usually associate with quieter people, I guess I will now) made for some slightly interesting conversation but nothing to write home about (first time meetings are a bitch). We finish, I pay since it sorta felt like a date, but then she buys some cigarettes which we smoke before I invite her to my place. We come over and she doesn't want me to turn on the TV, so I take this as a sign that we are supposed to be making out... I have no idea what I SHOULD be doing. I said "I don't really know if I want a relationship right now", which I said in a serious tone and "but we can go have sex if you want", which I said jokingly. To which she replies that she "has heard that before", which obviously makes me feel like an ass. I still had no idea as to what I should be doing. "What are you thinking?"...fuck... "I dunno", pause forever "what I could be doing to you" d'oh, now I HAVE to make out with her! Why? I don't want to hurt her feelings, she is a nice girl. I should try to have sex with her because she would feel wanted and I haven't had sex for a year and a half. I shouldn't have sex with her because if I do, and she wants a relationship and I don't, then I would feel like a piece of shit. Since I was already taking her top off at this point it seemed kind of moot. My penis was in control (just kidding), but I just hoped that maybe she would remember that I actually did say that I didn't want a relationship from before. I was in luck because even though I was "whipping her up into a horny frenzy" (she really did seem very turned on) and rubbing her clit through her pants, her metro ride would be leaving soon. She looked at the clock and said that it was getting close to the time she needed to catch the last train. I took this as a sign to get her the hell outta there so that I didn't have awkwardness in the morning when I get up at 5:30 and don't know what to do. Anyways, I help get her top back on and walk her to my front door. Was I avoiding disaster? I dunno. But I do know that I COULD have sex with her, I just don't know if making her a friend that you fuck would be a good idea. This post is too long, enough for now.

      I think "on Golden Blonde" would make a good name for a porn movie.  (but no Katherine Hepburn)

               My ex-girlfriend (of four years ago) was a nice girl. That is until after I was dating her for a while. We dated for a year and a half. If there was sex to be had, I am pretty sure we had it. We did it like bunnies. We broke up while I was in college and she was getting into college, which also happened to be the same one I went to. It was a horrible break up, which I would never want to relive. But afterwards we did hook up a couple of times... because we are needy people (as in, need the sex). We are still friends now and talk sometimes, but that really isn't the point of this post...             So, I called up my ex-girlfriend who used to dye her hair a lot, so she could help me dye my hair.... blond. Which is a big change if you have never dyed your hair before and your hair is a dark brown, which also happens to be my situation. And apparently my hair DOESN'T ABSORB BLEACH! An hour! an hour is what I let it sit in my hair for and, what do I get? A STRAWBERRY blond! an hour should have been enough to turn it a platinum-y color but I have armor hair. It really doesn't look all that bad. Although it is frizzy from the bleach so I woke up with some kind of afro-puff thing for hair. After a liberal dose of brushing and combing, coupled with a hat on my walk to work it settled down. Now I have all the reactions of my fellow co-workers to deal with. One of them shrieked with surprise at the sight. I am not that bad am I? hehe, another said he thought I was lying when I said I was going blond. Another, said she would never get used to it. But then some others said it was pretty slick, so hey mixed reviews but it is okay with me. I will just need to lighten it up a little next week.

                Hmmm I think I might wait a while to tell people that I am starting a web log. I need to see if I am actually going to write stuff in it. Plus, I don't want my friends to read it and tell me that it sucks. Not that they would mind you... but I guess I could post about that some other time. 20 something comes to blogspot to post some of his life. Sounds all too familiar right? hmmmm well I guess I am going to have to do better. Truth is I am not better than anyone really, or at least I try not to have that kind of attitude. It does kind of effect my competitive edge to make it more of a dull point that will annoy to great extent but never vanquish (vanquish? that is too big of a word for me, I better tone it down a little). Does your first post determine how the rest will go? I hope not.            Damn, I wish the tab key worked in this text editor. OK, a little about myself. I am a young guy living in DC who has a tech job. I love things such as cartoons and silly kid like stuff. I also like things like Anime, and going to museums and stuff (yes, stuff... I like to be descriptive). I take online classes that are counting towards my masters in IT. I also have NOT had sex in like a year and a half since my last girlfriend and I have lots of... feelings about this. It should be funny to write about me, trying to pick up women, because when all else fails to pick up women it will be funny to make fun of myself (but not too much fun, I am not that self deprecating). Well, I am at work... sooo... I should probably get back to the things I get paid to do. I might post some more later.

       So, yeah, there is the lady that likes to yell at passing cars (well I guess she just yells at pretty much anything that is coming by) on my way to work sometimes. Once I saw her on my way home.... it was different in a weird way. Today I think she got arrested. I saw her across Constitution avenue, which is like 6 lanes of separation and a good thing. I walked right by her twice and she can be kind of upsetting. So, all of a sudden she starts walking across the 6 lanes of traffic! Luckily, her crazy is not the type of crazy to ignore the actual cars coming by so she made it across the street ok. She did it like 50 feet from the nearest crosswalk so she was kind of jaywalking I guess. I have seen guys in business suits walk across the traffic before (impatient people), but they do it at the crosswalk... Then, I saw this Explorer/SUV thing come out of nowhere and turn its sirens on and go to where the lady is. She was just yelling on the side of the street she just walked to. Then I crossed the street since the sign was lit. I didn't really want to be on that side anyways. So, the white SUV police and a police cruiser pull up to the side of Constitution Ave right in front of the Department of Labor Building (she seems to come there a lot, I don't know why, but that is where I usually see her), and she continues to yell the stuff she normally yells while walking away from them. Three cops are chasing her, and when I say "chasing" I mean that they are walking (in no hurry) towards her, but she is walking in the other direction. I was a block and a half away by this point... I kind of wanted to see what happened to my crazy lady, but I also wanted to get to work on time. Last I saw the three policemen were escorting her back to the police vehicles. I guess she will be ok. She knew she was in trouble, or else she wouldn't have walked away from those officers. She must have some semblance of regular thought (not all of tha cra-z). I wonder if she just has like real bad   urlLink tourettes   where the brain is thinking "regularly" but the mouth keeps going with random ass crap. I guess she probably wouldn't stay on the side of the street if that was true though, so she must have somethin' else (too?). The constant barrage of talking about rape and her mother being killed or her mother's daughter being killed and once even the KKK, is almost too much weirdness to bear witness to.

       This past weekend was fun. I went to  urlLink Lulu's club Mardi Gras  in the Georgetown-ish area on Friday. The place is awesome, but the DJ was terrible. He would mix rediculous shit together, or maybe he bought a mix already done like that. I am not sure which idea is worse. Either way, it would switch from Bon Jovi to Usher, and then to some mix of  urlLink Like a Prayer  with something electronic, and it sounded awful. It wasn't a good mix... it was more of like one of those mixes you can  urlLink find for free on the internet . Anyways, the drink specials were good, domestic drafts for 1 dolla, and rail for 2. It allowed me to get pretty messed up for cheap. Some people were walking around with bottled beer (which was being sold for 4 dollars+ for the same shit) which I didn't understand when the specials were going on.  Maybe there is some special allure for bud light in a bottle that makes it better than a draft bud light. I think it all tastes like sugar water, but is carbonated. I will drink it... don't get me wrong. Some times are right for Guiness and some others.. it is Miller Time (I don't really like budweiser at all).  I later came back to the apartment with my friends RM and JM, and watched some  urlLink Last Comic Standing . KC went to Lulu's too but he went home with his girly friend so RM stayed in his bed.  The next day I used RM and JM's presence to ease my fear of playing Doom3. That game is freaky. It has gotta be good if you are afraid to play it alone in the dark right? Anyways, I found that dead people on the ground need to be shot up or else they will "wake up" and go after you. Also, when going up against a fire throwing demon, I scream like a little girl if unprepared. One came at me when all I had was a flashlight out. The game doesn't seem to let you carry a flashlight and a gun at once. I guess because you can use a flashlight as a weapon, but who really wants to get that close to one of the demons trying to kill you anyways? I told them that I would have to invite others over if I want to play the game because it is a scary game. It makes me feel kinda wuss-like, but I can't help it... the game roxors with the scariness.  That night I went to a keg party (kegger) at my friend EW parent's house that I haven't been to in ages. Lots of people from high school were there and it was awesome. Most of the people there I knew from high school. A few like EW I knew from before. LH I know since 1988 or 7 when he moved next door to me, EW I knew in summer camp when I was growing up and then in high school, and JC from like 2nd grade or something like that. I thought it was funny that EW's girl put up a picture of his penis on the refridgerator, but he took it down after a while. There was beer bongin' and quarters playing, it made me reminicent of the times in high school and beyond of our drinkin parties. MF was soo messed up he was like... humping people and stumbling all ova da place. My friend TG spent the night with this chick and though he was puking beforehand he stumbled into the room and woke up naked... although he doesn't really remember anything. But it is all good because she had sex with him again to remind him the day after. Strangely enough, this is the sister of someone else we went to high school with (well... I guess she went there too but later) she was a hottie, her name was BH. I believe she now has one kid and a kid on the way (I guess she just likes to fuck?). I went to the mall and hung out with my other friend SC on Sunday she's so cute and is often easily distracted. I was going to hang out with LH but he was striking the set of the show he was a stage manager (SM) for.  But I will see him this weekend, since I have to go house sit for my parents. I might have to throw a house party, but I would need to clean a hell of a lot first. My parents are pack rats of all kinds of things. It will be interesting to say the least.

      Today I came in at 8 instead of 7 am because of the dehydrating effects of beer. Although I didn't tell my supervisor this. I told her that "since I worked an extra hour on last Friday... I am going to use it today to come in an hour late", which worked pretty well.  Front Page was fun. It is nice to know a girl who is friends with other girls. This girl A was there with her friend J and 3 of her other friends came later, so it was cool. Her friend J was really cool and she was pretty cute too! I talked with her a bit and she seemed very interesting. When I say"talk" I actually mean yell, because we were in a very loud part of the bar. I think the speaker in the corner must have been pointed directly at us. I said that she and A should just stay at my place (although there isn't really that much room, but I guess that is the point.. "here sleep in my bed!"), because they had a long commute home (something like an hour, hour and a half). She replied "maybe if it were the weekend, but I have to work tomorrow". I was sure I didn't hear THAT right, but I did ;-P I told her that it was a shame because we could always use good looking girls hanging around our place, which is true. If I could pay female models to come and hang out at the apartment I think it would make me cooler by association, and if I wanted to see a hot girl I would just have to turn my head slightly (hm, good deal). I also talked to A's other friend M (one of the other 3), who also seemed pretty interesting. I talked to her for a while before she left (maybe I drove her away!). We smoked a cigarette and chatted it up. She kept looking out the window though. Said she was a people watcher.  On a side note. I found my cigarettes after not finding them all week! In the other post I wrote I talked about how my memory is bad. It is, because you could see them while standing in front of my dresser. It was on top of my 7ft bookshelf and under my stack of towels, but sticking out the side so I could see them. I was thinking to myself that I would be drinking that night and would be fiending for a cig. Then  *poof*  I look up to the right spot right after searching through this pile of bandanas that I have looked through 10 times before and see them like a shining grail shaped beacon! :-) But... I should probably quit soon since it is a bad habit. I will just have to jerk off some more. You know, to make up for the bad habit by increasing another habit. (that works right?)  So, a good time was had by all. I kind of appreciate the irony of my blog title now tho. I don't really have any sex, because I am single and not that great at just meeting women and having sex with them (note to self: acquire this skill). Also I don't really lie, I have the word truth tattoed on my back for God's sake, albeit in Japanese kanji. But the disk space thing, that isn't ironic in any way... unless  urlLink Alanis Morrisette  can make some connection.  urlLink Videotape  was already taken, and I work in help desk so it fits. Although, I do have porn on my computer at home... so maybe I have sex and disk space, no lies tho... I'm an angel.

        Hooray for me! The final in my systems engineering class is done! It was a pretty easy final tho. Equations were a big part of the hefty five question test. Equations are the easy part, then the trouble starts with essay questions. luckily the one short answer part was pretty easy to answer if you read the book a little. I look forward to having a masters degree, but I have to wait until the end of next year :-( I will proofread the test today at work and post it. Then, go to Front Page bar to celebrate tonight.      I have come to realize that my short term memory is kind of bad. I have hidden my cigarettes from me somewherez in the apartment (I already searched my car). The point was to not have them accessible until I went out drinkin'. But, if I put them away and do it quickly... I actually don't remember where I put them! This is stupid of course, but it bugs me that there is half a pack somewhere and I am not sure where. I have places where I usually put them, but it isn't in any of those places. MAkes me wish my memory was better. Maybe I should take more ginko biloba. It is probably the drinking or those drugs I did which is to blame! yeah, that's why i don't do you drugs anymore! damn you! But not you beer, how could I ever get mad at lil old beer? Damn, you have alcohol too! Well shit, one vice is making me blame the others. This is getting rediculous... I might post more later. Maybe about that new stupid fire drill procedure we got yesterday.

      Now it is time for techtalkingguy's showcase of stupid stuff. This is a new segment of blog that I invented because I didn't feel like writing some cool stuff today. Today's showcase is explaining the co-worker RV. RV is one of the guys I work with. He is from Equador! (I swear that the people of our help desk are selected at random) He likes to talk on the phone in Spanish. In fact, I am pretty sure he likes it better than talking in English. He makes a pot of coffee every morning by freshly grinding the beans with care in his small bean grinder. Then he shovels it in the coffee pot and tries to strain some water through, even though the coffee is so strong it would knock you out if you weren't used to it. After he gets done with that I steal a cup and mix in some coffee with my cream and sugar. I think if I took more than one cup of coffee, then my heart would explode from the caffeine intake.  He likes to ask other people their opinion on the problems that he has to solve. I am not sure if he is just someone who doesn't know or if he is needing a second opinion. He has done some forgetful things in the past so I don't know. He is in his upper 40s and still likes to look at the boobs at work. I like to look at boobs at work too but I have been avoiding it to keep from getting into trouble. All the guys here in my office love "the boobies" (and "the booty"), and I say "the boobies" instead of just boobs because I would like to stress the importance of finding the good kind of boobies that would justify a title (damn like... those are the boobies to end all boobies... or maybe that is just something I find funny). The quest is just as important as the goal in this case. There have been manly mags passed around showcasing a variety of Godly ass shots as well.  I seem to be getting off track (it's that boob talk I guess). RV also likes to use the term "little boys room". Now I am not hating on this term or anything, I just think it is kind of funny to hear a 40 something guy say it. I guess this is what having kids does to a person. Finally, he is a shorter Equadorian  urlLink Bob Vila ! He loves to do work on his "new" old house. He is remodeling the whole place (it seems like) from top to bottom. He has certification to wire his shiznit and work on home improvement. Right now he is doing the downstairs bathroom. It was funny looking the way it was before. Every week he brings in his new pictures on the progress of his house (the crown molding, the new closet, the tiling on the floor, the new kitchen cabinets, etc...). We make jokes about bringing him around to our own places and having him fix up some stuff. All in all RV is a nice guy. So what if jokes are made about him eating tacos and watching out for immigration officials? It's ok because he's cool and they are just jokes. And he tells some about watermelon and fried chicken too (although that is directed at CB in particular, our resident black pi-mp hehehe) it is all in the name of good fun.

      I wonder what the government is trying to do to us? Why is it that we have capitol police all around the capitol these days. Are they really afraid of a terrorist attack? I just think that if they are going to use all of these police then they are going to scare more people from coming to DC than actually stopping anything. The presence of the police probably does stop something from happening, but what? I haven't heard about many terrorist criminals being caught. They caught terrorists that were overseas and they caught some that were around in "sleeper cells" a while back but not many recently. Are we supposed to be scared? I don't want to be scared of the terrorists who supposedly have an ever-looming sphere of influence to infiltrate and assault our people. I don't want it to happen. Terrorist attacks are scary! But, then again, it seems like they are winning against the American people if we are acting so freaked out all the time. Who am I to say what is best for the American people? I don't know. I know that I walk down the street by the senate buildings every day and I know that they don't check my bookbag or anything. I wouldn't do anything bad though. I am a nice guy... not a terrorist. Plus, I am sure the cameras are always watching all of the people that walk by there for extra super orange level security. I sure am glad of the freedom of the press though. You see, our country is great. Just because some presidents make mistakes once in a while, * urlLink ahem * and we as the American public are allowed to call them out on it! (that is... without government smackdown) Although with the  urlLink Patriot   urlLink Act , which no-one read, who knows nowadays. I tried reading some of it... whooo big snoozer, but with important impacts on everyday life nevertheless.  I also forgot my cell phone at home today. I didn't even realize it until after I got most of the way to work. I guess that just proves how much I really need it. They are convenient and all. It is just that I don't need one to live. It does have an awesome bowling game on it though, and the rockin' Peanuts theme on it (it is called "Linus and Lucy" I believe) for the ringer.

                I just had to say that my niece is very cute. She turned 3 this past weekend. She had on these hello kitty underwear and she kept flashing them to everyone because she was wearing a dress and she hasn't quite gotten the hang of wearing it yet I guess. She just likes to pull the dress up to her face because it is fluttery like a sundress. She also wanted to show everyone her ability to spin around in a circle. Hehehe, kids are funny sometimes.           I also got to see my other niece's son. A newborn who is about 3 weeks old. She is too young to have a baby (@ 18). She is handling it very well though. She is a strong girl who doesn't take crap from anyone. Some people would call that being a bitch, but she should have respect. I only hope that she keeps going to school and doesn't fall into stuff that isn't aligned with her hopes and dreams.           I saw a nice play called "when the world was green" this past friday night. The actors were awesome in it and the writing was cool too. The lighting made it pretty interesting because some constant lighting would have made this two person show very dull. It is about a chef who chased his cousin all over the world trying to kill him because of some family feud from a insult a long time ago. The chef accidentally kills the wrong man and gets sent to jail. It is in jail that the play takes place and he is being interviewed by a young (and pretty hot) reporter. Then after the play I went to a nice hole in the wall bar with the cast and crew and they all sang karaoke and I watched until I got a little tipsy and sang "space oddity" by David Bowie. Then, after the bar closed, we hung out at BH's house who played the hot intrepid reporter and then I went home.             Saturday I saw lots of nice sailboats at the Governor's Cup ending. Played some little frisbee golf with friends. I seem to have hurt my shoulder since I was trying to throw this huge branch into a tree. I had a reason tho, my frisbee was stuck in a tree pretty far up. The branch I was trying to use was too big so I almost separated my shoulder (I think), at least .. it hurt. Then we ate and went to the Green Door bar and undertook some drinkin. I played darts and stuff, and since I am not good the game lasted a while. I grabbed my  friend JH's butt and that was pretty cool. She is very flirty. I would make out with her if she wanted to. She is pretty cute. Then Sunday I woke up slightly hungover in my friend RM's bed which was funny just because I didn't want to sleep on the small couch. At least I didn't wake up with my ass hurting or anything.  I was slightly hung over because of the 4 shots of tequila and beer I had while playing drinking trivial persuit. But after South Park came on TV we stopped playing. Anyways, Sunday was the day of my nieces b-day. It was a good weekend.

                        Today I got a ride to work! The woman who gave me a ride saw me walking down the street and thought that she recognized me. Turns out she did. Her name is MM and she works downstairs. She somehow knew it was me even though the last time she saw me I had long brown har instead of short blond hair. Most people seem to have trouble recognizing me at first. I asked her about this and she didn't really know how she knew it was me. I think I have a distinctive walk maybe. I have a nice lil swagger on the boundry of a pimp stride... haha, no not really.                      Anyways it was kind of nice to get a ride into work. It is actually kind of chilly out today and the wind was blowing. I was carrying in my suit that I had made for Otakon, so I could get the pants made to where they actually fit. The suit was blowing around and I was tired of carrying it. So warm car was a much better option.                       She lives in the same quadrant of the city as the building we work in. I wondered why she was in the north section of town and asked her about it. She said it was because she was dropping off a friend of hers to work. I would drive to work myself... but it would cost to park unless I park farther south in the residential part, but then I would be walking for 10-15 minutes anyways. The excercise is pretty good for you anyways! I will probably start biking once it gets a bit cooler out. MM had off today but she was still going in to pick up some slack. I don't think I want any job where that happens to me. No going in on weekends or anything like that. Although I am a nice guy and could see myself getting pressured into some shit like that.                     Grrr... on a different note I have been watching Love Hina on my WinAmp player. The internet TV is the most awesomest thing ever! As long as the server is not full then you can watch some episodes of streaming anime. They also have a selection of porn which I readily started watching the internet TV for. But  urlLink Love Hina  captured my heart, mostly because it is funny and they beat up the main character a lot.  My roommate said it reminded him of the same animation as  urlLink Mahoromatic  , which is also pretty cool. but.. if you have the chance, please take a look at some of these classic anime series. Maybe someday I will meet a girl who will enjoy the silly things I enjoy someday. Then she will be my best friend...  One thing that sucked about the ride to work I guess was that I got here 15 minutes early, and I don't get to leave 15 minutes early :-(

           Free of underwear today, boxers in particular! I am a boxers man, but I do have some briefs for those times when I run out of boxers. The briefs are also good when dealing with morning wood. Morning wood wakes me up sometimes and the boxers don't contain it very well.  Mostly because I sleep on my side or stomach and switch positions which is a lot, um.. more difficult with a woody. But today I wear none of that because I am free. I just wanted to let it have freedom and feel the breeze... wait, feel the breeze? That isn't right. Also it might be a little eeensy weeensy bit because... I don't have any clean boxers, and I am kind of waiting for the weekend. See, because this weekend I am going home so I can see a play that my friends are in, and this way I can use my parents washer and dryer without using all of my quarters.       Ok, on a side note, one of my friends is in jail due to some assault charge. It is some charge which I have no idea whether it happened or not. I wasn't there. It was some crazy conflict between my friend TG and my friend SC when they were breaking up or broken up and still hanging out or just fucking... who can keep track anymore. As far as I can tell they are both crazy, but they are my friends and I love them. Both fun to hang out with but I guess I cannot hang out with them at the same time since this trial. It is all a big mess. ARRRRGHH! (sometimes I just feel like yelling when I hear about this)      The one who told me about this was my friend AW who I used to date (refer to the post where I dyed my hair). She told me all about this and tried to explain how TG was a dumbass and changed his story and whatnot and should have pleaded guilty. But he only got two days in jail for whatever, so I guess it could be worse. Then she goes on a rant about how this guy she went on a date with drinks too much  SODA . I understand about drinking too much alcohol and things like that... but too much soda? As she started talking about the  urlLink high fructose corn syrup  I couldn't help but laugh, mostly because I was listening to a rant on soda. But this is perhaps one of the strangest problems with a date that I have ever seen aside from episodes of Seinfeld. hahaha!

       Wow, I actually did nothing useful at work today. I sat around and did nothing. I went to this cool game   urlLink here .    I also played a little bit of   urlLink peasant's quest  , which I had already finished. Then I tried reading my textbook, failed miserably and then started drawing a nice pic of Harry Potter and one small characiture of myself. Since no one was calling I then browsed J.k. Rowling's personal website, which was pretty cool. I am glad the government has money to pay me to do this. I was considering banging my head on my desk for an hour or two but then thought that people might try and copy my "edginess", then banging your head on your desk wouldn't be just my "thing" anymore.  Oh well, time to go home.

           mmmmm.... coffee, only one cup a day is all I need, but I certainly do need it or else I would fall asleep on my desk. Last night my roommate bought a little oven roaster for his dinner. He put it in the oven, and then our friend JB roped him into going to Adams Morgan to pick up her credit card. This is because they went out Friday night with our other friend SB (man, using both initials sounds better than using one letter nomenclatures) and she got a bit tipsy. If fact, I called her last night to make fun of her for being stupid drunk and she said she didn't really remember much.  So, it's Friday, my roommate and SB and JB were at Madam's Organ partying it up. SB took one too many and started to pass out on the bar, so obviously, they got kicked out (hehe). But, JB had a tab running so they had her credit card. They went back to get it last night (JB and roomie, not SB cuz she was at work). JB and roommate stayed out late drinking I guess because he didn't wake me up going into the kitchen. The chicken was left out on the counter like I had left it before. I offered to put it away because I am a nice guy, before he left I was like "hey, want me to wait until it cools and put it in the fridge?" but he said no. I don't really know if this is bad or not. It isn't cool because it sat out all night.... but how bad could it be since it was just one night and I am sure he would eat some for breakfast and put it away? I really have no idea. I think it is kinda gross, but that is it. Only thing that bothers me is the food particles left sitting out on a plate after the dinner is finished. Not just one night but for days at a time, which I try not to do but roomie doesn't seem to mind that much. Sometimes, when you do this, new life begins to form (and smell particularly awful). I like to imagine what interesting kinds of protozoa there are on the dishes before I rinse them in scalding hot water, which hopefully kills them all.    In other news, I saw the woman I like to affectionately call "crazy lady" on my way home yesterday. She just yells at anyone who cares to listen (which is often no-one) as she walks down the street. I find it strange because it isn't curses or something like that. It is bad things that have happened in her life (or what she "thinks" happened, thanks to KM for bringing this to my attention because, I mean, the woman is pretty crazy). She was yelling about how her mother was killed in 1998. I suppose that if something were to trigger a schizophrenic episode this would be it. Anyways, this is like the 3rd or 4th time I have seen her. Usually I see her in the morning so this was a "rare" sight for me. She is becoming a familiarity with me. I think I might say hi or something if I get the courage to get close to her. It is almost like the yelling is some Tourette's syndrome reaction where she yells at cars and anyone who passes by or no one in particular. I wonder if she would put the chicken away after coming home late...

                 Well this isn't like a "what ever happened to baby Jane?" kind of deal. The girl that I met online a little while back and made out with seems to have disappeared. I don't really see her online anymore and it is kind of strange. I just want to see how her job is going, make sure she is cool and stuff. I hope nothing I did managed to scare her off (maybe I grabbed her boobie the wrong way or something). I do assume that she is looking for a new place since she told me that she was a little while back. Apparently her roommates aren't that nice. It is hard to deal with new people sometimes when you move in from Ohio like she did. I would call her but I don't even think it is something serious. She can take care of herself. Oh well, I guess maybe she has found a new place in DC or something (she was in VA before). I am not sure that she has her own computer, and I don't know if she would be the type to just go out and get a new one and some internet provider, like me. Of course, I need the internet and its great store of knowledge. Well... that and I need it to take my classes. Speaking of which, the semester is almost over for the summer and my final is coming up. Oh boy! I get to draw diagrams and explain the finer points of systems engineering. I get an in person class next semester. I think that as long as I can make it there on time then I will be a-ok. In person ones are much easier to discipline yourself in. The point is that, if I don't read for this in person class I will feel like an idiot when I attend it, kind of like a motivator ya know. Anyways, I gotz ta get my rent paid today, and that is all the way in Cleveland Park :-( One Hour! just to metro out (from work) and get my rent paid. I have a pair of very nice supervisor and project manager that let me do this since my lunch break is only supposed to be 30 minutes. I am not getting very many calls this morning anyways.

       I found   urlLink this   online. Apparently a glomp is one of those hugs where you just kind of run up to someone and kind of hug-tackle them in a playful kind of manner. Curiosity = satisfied. Now next year at Otakon I can run over and tackle people if they carry around signs for glomping! mu hu hahahaha!

                       Not that a lot of people like to hear about anime otaku running around trying to get hugs from each other, but maybe some people do.                  First off, some people had signs up for glomps. ?- I have no idea what a glomp is and I was very confused by this. And it kind of made me pissed off that these people were confusing me, since I am supposed to be reasonably intelligent. I guess I will send an e-mail to the people of Otakon and ask em what is up.                  Friday I was there by myself and figured I would wander around for a while. I wanted to watch the Anime Music Videos since I thought they weren't going to be playing them that often, but I was wrong! They played it like 10 or 12 times so I could have just watched it the next day with my friends and not be seeing it for the 2nd time.  I went to the "otaku-rave" (one word?) and saw lots of interesting dancing, although I can't talk since I didn't dance myself. It wasn't that the music wasn't good, it was pretty awesome. I just felt a bit weird dancing without people that I knew there. Didn't want to be just dancing "by myself" I suppose, that and most of the people there were under 20.  So.. I went to a discussion on adult entertainment instead. They discussed lots of interesting differences between American and Japanese porn.  Like the fact that pretty much all of Japanese porn is legally bound to blur out actual penetration. They showed clips and everything! The bukkake film that they showed was hilarious. Right before the guys with blurred penises got to jerk off (I think they might just be blurred while jerking off at this point) on this girl this one guy from off camera ran up and spooged right at her. She was not prepared at all and she jumped up as the guy jizzed on her and the guy next to her. They must have rewound that clip 20 times. They also discussed "rape" videos and rope bondage and hentai and all of the other kooky stuff that originated in Japan. It was very informative. Especially when they said that Asian people have smaller penises than the American guys in porn. At least this gave me a good thought to have for the rest of the night and a little bit right now "my penis is big compared to Asian penis" hooray for me. After the panel I went back to J and E's apartment and wondered how E's girlfriend... whose name also starts with an E was doing. Because E and E2 were at the emergency room since E2 was having stomach problems. Turns out it was some kind of cyst and it was causing her troubles. I decided to have beer to celebrate her being alright later.                  I saw some interesting anime. This one called  urlLink Risky Safety  was pretty interesting even though they showed us episodes starting at the 9th one. This, made it very confusing. There was a little witch guy (risky) with a scythe and sometimes turned into a little angel (safety) and they were friends with this girl and then it changed to this other girl... WTF, anyways, the episodes were only 10 minutes long which made them... kind of annoying with the previews for the next episode happening twice before you saw it. I was also hung over on Saturday and Sunday since I went out drinking at my friends' place after "the con". I only had four hours of sleep friday night and was pretty dehydrated. Sunday, I didn't go back to Otakon because it was raining pretty hard out and I was wholly unmotivated mostly because my camera ran out of battery power (that piece of crap). I got to see my cousin at the convention as well. He went to drink with me Saturday night. I got him to do a flaming shot which I didn't partake in since 151 doesn't really seem that appealing. Although fire is appealing, very sensual, just not when I know that the 151 "tastes like burning". Good times, although there were so many  urlLink Inuyashas  there I had wondered if maybe I was supposed to go as him too but just forgot. I picked up some MegaTokyo manga and got the hell outta there. After watching Zatoichi: the blind swordsman first tho. And I must say that if you love samurai and cool fight scenes then you should watch this movie. enough for now :-P I am always making really long posts, and no-one is likely to read them, so what do I care (but I guess I should get back to work).
