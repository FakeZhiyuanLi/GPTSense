        More About Me: The People who have made, are making and will be continually making a significant difference in my life...     Andre' Patrick Micheal Du'Pratt and Jean Du'Pratt nee Toh Yeoh Cheung , The ones who were, are and always will be there for me. Not only did they make a difference in my life. They created my life. Nothing in the world can ever repay what they did.   Mr Tan Woon Wee; HOD DnT & Teacher- This is a great guy who can show you that school is where one learns to take responsibility and teaches his students that hard work ALWAYS pays off. He's a degree holder but pretends to be unknowing malaysian educated teacher who doesn't understand what his students say but actually does and his favourite phrases are "Y0U RUBBISH!!!", "NO INTEGRITY!!!", "CANNOT BE TRUSTED ONE!!!", "NO SELF RESPECT!!!" "YOU BETRAYER!!!", and a recent addition, "You betrayerER!!!" when he says this he's actually trying to reprimand a student or make a point to a class in his seriously lack of vocabulary but incredibly understanding ability of bombastic words in English. The whole class including the student would be laughing uncontrollably right in his face. It looks as if theres no recpect but every student that knows him, remembers him, respects him and whose life has been somehow touched by him :)   Ms Saadiah Saadon; The best English Teacher that Greenview has and will ever have whose brimming with ideas, solutions and passion for her job and students. English would never be the same without you! Thanks a Million!   Mr Chionh Chye Aik; My secondary 3 form teacher and the math teacher who didn't give up on me. I had flunked my sec 1 & 2 math without a hope in the world of even touching a pass when he, like the light at the end of a cold dark tunnel of numbers, formulas and wierd equations, came into my life and showed me that math wasn't as bad as it seemed. I attained an A1 or an A2 in math for all tests and exams thereafter.   Mrs Law Chor Hoon; The secondary 4 math teacher of my class. A honour of having the most senior and oldest math teacher in the school whom is carrying years of service excellence under her belt or a dread at having the strictest teacher that we had ever encountered in our Tenth year of compulsory education? I may never know. Why? Well firstly, i found she gave to many worksheets, like ten a day; each a past year exam(paper 1 & 2) from other schools. Secondly, Thank God i had German classes or Choir on the day of her remedials, which was practically everyday except sunday which she staunchly believed was for the practicing of math and math only. Thus i so unfortunately[yeah right] missed her classes :) To top it all of, she would constantly tell all the teachers that 4E3 was the worst math class in her entire life and that she had no more blood to vomit(i never did see her throw up before though) and that math was the most important thing to this class. Well the other teachers supported us and despite her protests, we would attend the others instead insisting that we sucked in everthing else too and she was quite concerned to hear that and to our utter confusion, dissapointment and added stress, shared what we told her to the rest of the teachers again. The June holidays never arrived for the the class of 4E3... Save One :). whoelse?   Muhd. Zahier B Amza; I have known this young man since 1E3 and we have both grown and changed together. We have done every school/class/subject/group project together for as long as i have known him. Why? Simply because he is a Great Team Player and can be counted on always.   Muhd. Rahimi B Hussein; Another young man that i've known since 2000. We were put to sit next to each other since mid-2002 and all through 2003. I don't know how, but he tolerated my nonsense and allowed me to.. er.. "refer" to his english/math/geog/social studies homework when i.. er.. didn't have enough time to complete mine... He was obviously a great resource person and one who was able to see the funny side of things.   Ashley Tome Joseph; With him we i was able to share my thoughts on life, school, teachers, homework, girls, games and priesthood. He is still a person i can call up to have a chat with and share a real language joke or a play on words that most in the school wouldn't grasp fast enough. We were part of a small handfull of students whose English Language ability was beyond the others. I remember Ms Saadon telling us to bear with her lessons when they were indeed to simple for us as it was for the sake of the class.  For my class, there were five of us who were considered adept in the English Language. Namely Ashley, Lydia, Sabariah, Elly and yours truly. This would be obvious when ms Saadon would blurt out in the midst of teaching a joke or phrase that ended with the five howling with laughter and tears and the others looking with appalled looks and firmly believing that this teacher and these students had well and truly lost it.   Lydia Norman; A girl who showed me that one must learn to let there hair down on occasion and not be too orderly all the time. An extrovet by character, i got to know her through the choir and when we took the same bus home. We became close friends who could exchange views on almost everything under the sun and felt no restrictions whatsoever because of gender differences.   Teddy, Aroon, Timothy, Ji Nin, Russell, Kelly, Amanda, Kai Deng, Perry, Pavel; German was the most interesting class i attended but you guys changed that. I will never forget the laughter and times we had at MOELC.   From Greenview, my friends, close friends, buddies and peers that i would like to remember:  Marcus Wong, Sulaiman, Calvin Christopher, Amelia Lim, Sabariah, Salsiah, Winnie, Fadli, Kelly, Elly, Lyn, Andy Tong, Siew Chin Hoong, Theresa Loo, Hafiz and the classmates of 1E3, 2E3, 3E3 and 4E3... Friends Always.    To DARE/1A/04:  I look forward to the lectures, lab work and fellowship i shall share with the 23 of you in the next 3 years...   Last but not least, The cool people i had the privilege of meeting at the SuperTeen Camp in December of 2002, Guan Min, Wai Kit,  Mie Miura  and the many others whose names i shall try to remember. Hope it did change some aspect of your lives, as it did to mine.   Even More About Me:  Great Cousins Chen Munn, Ann Jee, Chen Fye, Bruce, Yi Heng, Wesley, Yi Zhe and Mackenzie and the in-laws to be Amos(Ann Jee) and Jen Ai(Munn).    Someone Special to Me:  There are many people who have made an impact on my life in someway and i have not recorded most of them because of a lack of time and memory space. There is one person i want to introduce to you. I have only met her twice and yet i keep asking myself, "Why do i keep thinking, dreaming and wishing to have this girl by my side?" There are so many other girls in this world but she stands out the most. Why? I haven't the slighest clue. I just like her and am attracted to her. Think about this," What makes the perfect girl to you?" Smart, Attractive, Sporty, Outgoing, Adventurous, Friendly, Logical, Level Headed and a great sense of humour. Sounds too much to ask for? Well yes. Initially i thought that too. Until i saw her and that all changed. All of the above could summarise her. Or am i exagerating? I doubt it. To her i have this message: In life, not all things go as we hope for. It does seem immposible from where we are. We are like two people living in the same country but worlds apart. Two systems, two views, two seperate paths to our destinies and two years apart. Against the odds, we met. The chance meeting is but a fading memory now. However i try to move on, i am held back by people i see on the street who remind me of the one thing i remember well, your face. Maybe i'm not trying hard enough to forget you. Should i try harder? I have already thought less about you and dreamt less. I hope one day, i won't just be recalling your face but see you in person, as i did once 11/4 years ago, standing next to me. Even if it were for a moment, it would last a lifetime...  1.8.87 & 1.8.89, December 2002- August 2004 Turn Left, Turn Right(not to be taken literally, duh)

       I made it into the Aerenautical Engineering Course and i am really pleased. I have made a fair amount of friends but only a few i would prefer as close friends. Most... well... are not ones whom i would put a lot of trust in. My class has 24 guys. Yep, Guys. No Girls. No distractions and no incentive.. Haha.. But we got along well and i am fitting in well into poly life on the whole. To my old school friends, i personally wish you all the best in your future undertakings and hey, the O's were honestly not that bad as we thought. To my students, honestly the O's are what you make of it. Let nothing stand between you and your distinctions. By the way for the rest of you, i have about 18 students in my Catechism Class and they ROCK!

       It started of really wet but thankfully ended dry. From 7:45 this morning, till 1:15 in the afternoon just begging. Technically speaking it was. Except that it was legal, liscenced and backed by the President[laughs]. But it was hard work and great fun. Total Personal Collection: $121.65... not bad eh? Total Class Collection: $1017.77... The Highest in SP? Hopefully. For a class of 24 guys, those that met up, bonded, laughed and got to know each other. I can say i am truly fortunate to be in this class. Since we're all guys, not only is it like being in a guy school, we are not so conservative as when girls are around, and we're highly organised, effective, open and cooperate without much disagreement. Which works well for all. Anyway we're sorta the geeky lot in poly. The points range from 9-13. Which we are quite proud of haha... Looking forward to class on monday when we meet our lecturers. And we all noticed that there are soo many girls in the School of Business Faculty. The ratio is like one guy to FIVE girls... and like there are only as many girls as i have fingers in the WHOLE of aero course... And the ones in the same course aren't that well... attractive.. the hot ones are all in Marketing and Accounting... WHY!???

       A good start i would say, I arrived at 8:28am and my first class started at 9. Kiasu it seems but i am most certain that the train moved faster today... haha.. it normally takes an hour to get from Pasir Ris to Dover but took 45mins today... So it kicked off well... My Math Lecturers are not bad and didn't bore us to death when they spoke which is a good sign since they will be teaching me for an acedemic year. Tutorial ended a half hour earlier as the lecturer thought it was fitting on the first day to end early, must be a norm cause' we got that treatment from the other lecturers too. The workshop lesson for two hours every monday feels soo much like DnT lessons again with a much more civilised and less abusive Lecturer. Today's class really split the ones who knew what they were doing(ahem yours truly) and those guys who couldn't tell a plastic mallet from a chisel... Luckily i had two years experience so it was a breeze though i don't really like all this physical activity. Anyway, all work is now by hand so no manual work. YAY!!! And we tended to walk in one big group for some strange reason or other? Male Bonding? or Males deprived of Females? The latter definitely. Everywhere we went, we saw girls. Girls in groups, Girls walking alone, One guy surrounded by four or five girls!!! We looked looked on with such envy... Sigh oh well... No Distraction and No Incentive. Remind me why i joined Aeronautical Engineering? All the nice ones went to JC.. we all qualified to go to some JC... Now we regret choosing poly... LoL!

       Artist: Ronan Keating Title: When You Say Nothing At All Lyrics:  It's amazing how you speak right to my heart , With out saying a word you could light up the dark , Try as i may i could never explain, What i hear when i don't say a thing.  Chorus - The smile on your face let me knowthat you need me , There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me , The touch of your hands says you'll never leave me , The touch of your hand says you'll catch me wherever i fall , You say it best when you say nothing at all. -  All day long i can hear people talking aloud , But when you hold me near ,You drown out the crowd , Try as they may ,They could never define, What's being said between your heart and mine.   Chorus (2x)

       Artist : Daniel Bedingfield  Album : Gotta Get Thru This  Song : If You're Not The One Lyrics:  If you’re not the one then why does my soul feel glad today? If you’re not the one then why does my hand fit yours this way? If you are not mine then why does your heart return my call If you are not mine would I have the strength to stand at all  I never know what the future brings  But I know you are here with me now We’ll make it through  And I hope you are the one I share my life with  I don’t want to run away but I can’t take it, I don’t understand If I’m not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am? Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?  If I don’t need you then why am I crying on my bed? If I don’t need you then why does your name resound in my head? If you’re not for me then why does this distance maim my life? If you’re not for me then why do I dream of you as my wife?  I don’t know why you’re so far away  But I know that this much is true We’ll make it through  And I hope you are the one I share my life with And I wish that you could be the one I die with And I pray in you’re the one I build my home with I hope I love you all my life  I don’t want to run away but I can’t take it, I don’t understand If I’m not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?  ‘Cause I miss you, body and soul so strong that it takes my breath away And I breathe you into my heart and pray for the strength to stand today ‘ Cause I love you, whether it’s wrong or right And though I can’t be with you tonight And know my heart is by your side  I don’t want to run away but I can’t take it, I don’t understand If I’m not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am Is there any way that I

       The third week of polytechnic has just passed and i wonder, "Did i choose the right course for me." Seriously, forget the girls- such a liability they are, i think to myself in class; Was it the low cut off point? Or the glam in the name Aeronautical Engineer? I don't know. I am enjoying myself a lot and have no complaints. Hey, things are going really well. The lecturers and the school in general seem to treat us different. They tell us, "So  YOUR  the aeronautical engoneering students right?(duh!) Well then, i expect more from you guys!(what??!!!) 11pts average right?(so what??)." We soon found out expecting more meant literally flying through the lecture notes and tutorials and lab work... i must say its quite exciting that everyday we learn so much and for some reason, we havent been bogged down with homework, projects, assignments, difficult tests or demanding lecturers. I mean our lecturers would go through the chapter quite fast and give us a few questions to do... That's it! Anyhow... i have waited a year for this(laughs) and in one week...&nbsp; YAY!!!! I guess this course isn't so bad... And my class really ROCKS!!!&nbsp; DARE/FT/1A/04&nbsp; ---> All for One, One for All. 21 freshies, and hopefully in April 2007, 21 Diploma Holders( hopefully... )
