      I went today to pick up the vacuum and was 8 minutes late - the shop had closed.  I will stay on this and get it picked up and take it to 1016 at that time.       Jimmy G. says we are going to have a showing of the recovery movie called  "MY NAME IS BILL W."   This is set to happen over the 4th of July weekend.  Stay tuned to this fine channel for the exact day and time.  I will rent the movie from Blockbuster and make an attempt to be there. I'm not sure if I will be going up to Chicago over the weekend or not.    Matt and I have had a couple of conversations and he seems to be open minded and willing to learn.  I am impressed by his ability to at least mention that he can see the errors in his thinking in the recent past.    Jimmy G. seems to be doing an admirable job in the early going, even with some curve balls along the way.  He made a very nice analogy the other day.  He said that he sees the house as kind of a fraternity house without the alcohol / drugs.  I really look forward to seeing the comraderie develop as one can develop with fraternal brothers. This is truely working the 12th step and shows that this type of spirituality is the very backbone of our organization.  Nice job Jim - keep up the good work....and thanks for posting the thing on anger.   No one commented about the possibility of a cookout in the near future......does this mean - lack of interest, or is everone too busy? Check your social calendars and let's put one together!!   Side bar note to Chase - My former relative that you recently spoke with may need to get some help with a "nose candy" problem. I hated to hear that - seriously - I really respect him as a person.

      Matt appears to be adjusting to his program for he is going too both the 8am and the 6pm Beewolf meeting. This is a signicifient improvement in his recovery attitude.  I go to the 6pm Beewolf meetings every evening and he rides with me in the recovery mobile. Matt is short on money to buy the necessities but he did receive his medical card today.   I informed him today that he would have Internet access on or before this Saturday at 5PM

      Matt asked for a ride to a meeting yesterday - 8:00 am.  He advised that he was going to try to make two meetings a day.    Nice job everyone.  Let's see if he can be that consistent.  Chase

      Is that Jimmy G., or Stuart Smalley of Saturday Night Live fame? .......and doggone it, people like me.   According to Jimmy--Irrational-What he did to me was awful ( He killed my dog)  Rational--He has a different set of values than I do.( He believes dogs are evil spirits)  This is pretty far fetched, but just as some of the examples of RET used were.  RET is not meant to build a whole new set values for us, it is meant to teach us to see situations as they are, in a non-self focused sort of way,especially all-inclusive statements; all of, everyone, every time,etc.   Nor is it meant for us to be doormats. We can open mindedly see another's point of view, but also determine the health and validity of said view. We must allow people to be themselves, but we cannot enable someone by simply "understanding" that everyone sees things differently. Believe it or not, there ARE unhealthy beliefs out there that shouldn't be cosigned.

      	   A.	Anger comes from our beliefs and these beliefs can      fuel intense anger. B.	Most of these beliefs are irrational . C.	Anger can be a good thing if it is vented properly     .  Irrational Belief:  Some people are just bad. Rational Belief:   Who an I to judge a person as good or bad when I don’t have a full picture of his life here on earth. Do I just assume since he has done bad things that he hasn’t done good things. It is obvious that some people are worse then others. How much worse are they then the other person. How can it be proven that they are bad. There must be some good in them. Am I to assume that everything he has done in is life is bad? I simply don’t have enough information to support this belief. If a person is doing good things at that instant in time he can’t be doing bad things 1.	(Irrational) He should have not done this to me. (Rational) What he did was a pain however it’s not a life or death situation. 2.	(Irrational):  Others should act like I want them to. (Rational) I do not have the right to demand that people act like I want them too 3.	(Irrational) He is no darn good for behaving this way (Rational) I can not control the behavior of others 4.	(Irrational)  Others should act like I want them to  (Rational) He has a different set of values then I. 5.	(Irrational) I must do something about it to make myself feel better (Rational) I don’t have to act on this. 6.	(Irrational) What he did to me was awful (Rational) He has a different way at looking at things 7.	(Irrational) Life should be fair and when it’s not those responsible are no good. (Rational) Life doesn’t have to be fair 8.	(Irrational) All people must obey the law  (Rational) I wish all people would obey the law 9.	(Irrational)  This Person is evil  (Rational) His behavior is evil but not the person 10.	(Irrational)   If a job is worth doing its worth doing right  (Rational) If a job is worth doing it’s worth doing to the best I can at that time.

      I have read all the comments on Matt and find them very interesting.  It appears that Matt has begun following the suggested program.    He hasn't said anything to me about connecting his DSL hookup. Internet access could be beneficial to him but not necessary in recovery. He has said to me that it would give him more oppertunties to explore speaking engagements. This activity enhances his self-esteem and does help financially somewhat.    Matt does not feel good about himself and suffers from immature irrational behavior.  I might add that most alcoholics and or drug addicts suffer from the same affliction.  I still think he is more interested in his speaking engagements then on working on recovery issues. He has this street mentality that in my opinion he has to work on.  If the board feels that he should have Internet access I can hook him up tomorrow.  I have worked out the technical problems of such a connection that will not interfere with my Internet operations or the house Internet computer.  My suggestion to the board is too give it time to see if this improved Matt continues.  Jim  Matt gets a "high" from the public speaking.  That is a good and bad thing.  It is better thing than the drug that was used before.  But it is still a bad thing if we are obsesive about thing, rather than doing what we have to do each day.  This is a frequently observable situation of people in recovery.  Chase

      In the USMC, each platoon had four Drill Instructors.  Each had a different personality and skills, and while all served the same primary function, they were each able to handle different situations and recruits, according to their particular personalities and abilities.  Part of the reason that I chose to yell at Matt, is because of his disability.  He cannot see the expression on my face, which I would otherwise use, as much as words, to convey my thoughts on his behavior.  Additionally, I would normally write someone a letter, which I ultimately did, but that requires someone else to read it to him.  Finally, my point to him, is that if Matt or another participant is verbally abusive to someone in the house, they are not going to think that because someone is nice or week, they can just do that to them and get away with it.  NOOOOOOOO.  As I explained to Matt, I will come down and set the record strait and throw the abuse right back onto Matt.  I am not going to leave it to the victim.  Especially in the case of people in Recovery, if we allow the most dysfunctional people to dish it out, the more funcitoning people will just walk away from them and find another place to live.  I don't have any problem being the bad cop in this situation, because I can turn it on and turn it in a mere second.    And as Matt has not wronged me, but rather Jim, I think it is easier for me than Jim, to remain objective in regards to Matt and to temper the application of my words toward Matt.  But the bottom line with Matt and where he is at, is that he is showing a record of not listening until someone gets out the 2x4.  Until then, he is just going to blame other people.  Fortunately for matt, he is in a situation where blaming someone else and yelling at them is going to have immediate consequences, rather than worse longer term consequences as people build up justified resentment towards him and just walk away from him.  I have already informed Matt's IDOC counselor of the situation, and he advised that is a tecnique that he uses with inmates:  get just as loud and angry as they do, repeat what they have said, and then ask them how they would deal with someone like that.  That is probably where the discussion with Matt needs to go, now that he has backed down and is in listening mode........how are people supposed to react to someone exhibiting Matt's negative behaviors and attitudes.

      Thank God for every little blessing we have today.......  I think we need to be careful NOT to operate the recovery house as a US Marine Corp. unit. A well oiled ship, maybe.  The folks that are in the recovery house now and those to come, are in recovery  (not in punishment).  We punish ourselves enough out there.  Accountability -yes! Follow the rules -yes!  Treated with respect and dignity even when we may not deserve it - yes!  Why? Because it shows the residents how to behave by example.  I don't think anyone needs to yell and scream like a drill sergeant if we can speak  rationally and get the same point across.  I am fairly excited overall about the way things seem to be shaping up.  I have not had the time as yet to pick up the vacuum cleaner, but it is on my list of things to do.  Overall, lets enjoy sobriety and show the new folks what fun it can be.  I think we may be getting close to cookout time again soon.  For those of you who missed the last one, don't miss this one!!  Signing off for now.  Keep the faith,  Doug

      Has anyone talked to the folks at the work release to see what kind of situation they found with Matt? He doen't seem very grateful, to say the least, for a guy who has some semblance of freedom. Maybe it could be suggested that he try different meetings, to mix it up a bit. You never know where you will hear what you need. Maybe he will find a place where the group puts him in check, tells him poor me, poor me, pour me another, I think it goes. Most guys tend not to like the homeless shelters once they get there, maybe he would see that DSL in his room is a far better obstacle than being homeless. How is his speaking thing going? Still doing that?   I can't help but feel that his wife, who I believe was estranged, is a lot to put on his plate fresh out of state custody. I realize he has a child, and he needs to develop that bond, but he won't be developing any bonds if he can't focus on himself for a while. I can't think of one recovering person who benefited from immediately reestablishing a relationship before they established themselves. Maybe some sort of time frame could be put in place to expire before guys start working step 9 and assimilating into old relationships again.

      I don't see the point of reconciling.  I've told Matt, that when I have to be a 2x4 over his head and chew him out, that in 30 seconds, I will not be angry.  The point is to counter his stupid anger, with appropriate anger and let him get even angrier and possibly to the breaking point of relapse over that anger.  I know that the other night, I calmly drove home and hopefully left Matt so angry that he could not sleep a wink that night.  That is good.  If he is going to be a little jerk and gourse about what other people have not done, I want him to be up all night plotting about what he would like to do to Chase, or what he is going to say about Chase when he goes to a meeting.  In fact I hope he was just dying to go to a meeting to tell everyone what an asshole Chase is.  But like they use to tell us in the USMC "...girls, this is just how it is going to be....it doesn't have to be this way, but if you want to play games......we are going to show you how...."   And in the Corps, we didn't "reconcile" or apologize.  As men, we just admited our error and determined to work to not make that mistake again.    If matt wants to apologize, I can't stop him.  But apologies are cheap, and are frequently given as a manipulation, just to get the immediate trouble we've caused over with, and to sweep something away without actually doing something about it.   The better the liar someone is........the better they are at apologizing with words, and especially, sincere sounding, tearful words.  Let Matt apologize behaviorally speaking - with behavior like going to meetings.  I say be as fair to Matt as we would be to anyone else, but also require just as much accountability and meetings as would be required of anyone else.  I have no problem and no fear of someone going out and relapsing.  I have seen time and time again, the guy whining about other people, until the guy goes out and relapses, and that is what it takes for him to see that he needs to stop the whining and start working with other people on their terms, rather than just his own selfish terms.     Specifically on his DSL, I think that he needs it in his room for his blind stuff.  I think that is a special need that can be accomodated.  But I think that at this point, it would be better for Jim to deal with that issue only when Matt's couselor or aide from the department of rehabilitation is present.  Again - Jim should only deal with the DSL and computer issue when there is that third party aide to facilitate the communication and moderate anything.  Oh - Matt was threatening to go down to the South Side Mission, when his wife leaves.  I call that the Blind Man's Bluff.  Let him do that.  Nothing would further him toward that "attitude of gratitude" than a couple of days there.  Let him see what they do for him, when he screams about DSL

      I agree Matt should have another opportunity, but let's not dry our eyes every time someone cries wolf. It should not be the board's responsibility to transport, that's what the fellowship is for. It becomes too incestual. The more the board does for these guys, the less they will have to work, ........ENABLING. Why does Matt need DSL in his room, anyway?

      I was at the tail end of the 6 p.m. meeting at Beewolf and noticed that Matt, his wife and child were there.  Seems there was a public apology by Matt before I got there.  This was done by Matt without mentioning any names. It seems to me to be a step in the right direction.  The first step on the road to humility.  I believe Matt can become a very positive force at the recovery house, but he needs to be pointed in the right direction.  He is a charter member and it seems we have been working some of the bugs out "on the fly".  The fact that he is handicapped does  not  mean we need to feel sorry for him, nor do we have to bend over backwards for this guy. On the other hand, we do need to realize that he does have some special needs.  I believe we need to reconcile with Matt and start over.  This is the next right thing to do.  Lets start over with this guy.  Lets give Matt a date he can expect to get the DSL hook up in his room and let him know that it is contingent on him continuing to work a program and get along well with the rest of the inhabitants in the house.  I see I was outvoted on the number of meetings he needs to attend each week. I think with the transportation issue, each of the board members should offer to transport him to and from the meeting 1 day a week. I think Matt can ask his sponsor or other members on the remaining days.  Lets hear everyone's respones.  Doug

      Email Board meeting called by Chase Ingersoll.  Business on the table Matt Y.  Matt is not regularly attending 12 Step meetings.  He has been requested to do so by Board members.  He feels it is not necessary.       I've got 13 years, and I still attend a home group each week and am involved in any number of recovery activities thoroughout the day.   I don't think that it is unreasonable to require someone with as many outstanding issues as Matt, with a lot of time on his hands - to attend a meeting a day.   I have instructed Jim and informed Matt that there is nothing left for Jim or I to say to Matt, until he begins attending meetings.  If he cannot do that, we are not helping, but rather enabling Matt, and the brunt of that enabling is faced by Jim, our board member in residence.   The motion on the floor is:  Matt must agree to begin attending a meeting a day, or he must leave immediately.  He must then attend a meeting a day, for as long as he stays at the Recovery House, or until the board says otherwise.  I need to know if you are in favor of this, or otherwise......IMMEDIATELY.  If we are in favor of this, I will present Matt with a written statement and contact his social worker/counselor.   -Chase   I don't think a meeting a day is too much to suggest, especially for some one who has recently rotated back into society. I don't think anyone is telling him he must share or anything. This should be the guideline for anyone living in the house until there is evidence of a solid foundation in recovery.   I support this motion to expect daily meeting attendance.   -Rob B.   The name of the house is not RECOVERED HOUSE!  The fact that it is RECOVERY HOUSE, means we must be in recovery.....not just stopping usage.   My vote is at least 4 meetings each and every week.....documented and checked at the Sunday night meeting.     -Doug K.    I vote YES   -Jim G   I see two votes for a meeting a day.  I see one vote for four meetings a week.  The Chair Rules that a meeting a day is a requirement, until such time as ones life is filled with the various responsibilities that a person working a serious program will acquire.  At that point we as a Board can be flexible.  Accordingly, I will deliver to Matthew the determination of this board that he must begin daily meetings today, or he will have to remove himself from the premises today.  I’m sorry Matt, but……..  THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN   Chase

      So Matt is hollering at Jim this morning for not hooking up DSL for Matt. My how quickly the Needy fall from Grateful to Grumpy.  My suggestion is the application of the Silent Treatment.  Essentially, Jim and everyone else, have nothing to say to Matt, until Matt starts going to meetings EVERY DAY.  Listen:  this guy is blind.  We should be running circles around him, not allowing him to blow chaos at us at 200 mph.  And Jim - if you would not talk so loud, Matt would have no way of knowing whether or not you are there.  If we wanted to have a little fun with the kid, we could tell him that as a result of his berating you [Jim] Jim has moved out.  Then I could come down for a chat with Matt, and have the rest of you sneak into the house and watch the way that I "chat" with Matt.  Then, once he is all contrite and saying how sorry he is, I can let him know thzt the rest of you are in the room.  My best friend from Grad School, was confined to a wheelchair with Cerebral Palsy.  He was a fine example of how it is human nature will go out of their way to help a disabled person who is polite and grateful for any assistance.  The problem with Matt is that we have to keep in mind that he was a severe addict, long before he became blind, so this is only going to work if we approach him as an addict first, and a person with a disability second.

      I have several observations to share with you as the resident board member.  Per your email I agree with your analyses of Matt's lack of a recovery program.  I asked him today if he would like to go to meetings at 6pm or at 8pm. His response was I am waiting for a phone call.  It is my opinion and belief that he is taking advantage of recovery house and its generosity in providing him with housing.  He is continually on the phone with friends at all hours on the night.    Matt is going to have to show us that he is serious about recovery and at this time there is no evidence of this possibility.   My suggestion on the house phone is that it be located downstairs and no phones be allowed in the rooms.  As we discussed before that Internet access be on the recovery house computer not on private computers in rooms.  The house phone should have a time limit per call so that others can use it when needed.    John and his dad were over tonight and john is very satisfied with his room.  He seems very dictated to sobriety and is the kind of person recovery house can be successful with because of his attitude.  I feel very comfortable to be in a mentoring position with him.   All indications are that he will move in Monday or Tuesday.   Your comments please   Jim

      It's not just the minimal time in Recovery, but also the particular personalities, that are going to constantly perster whomever they can, with their "cares".  I recall my homeless shelter days, and there were those type of characters and then there were those who attempted to sense what you had going and what you had time for, and took great pains to not interupt your other tasks, chains of thought and conversations with others that you might be having.  Others, were just totally oblivious to what anyone else was doing, and it became more and more difficult to be patient with them.  I think that using email might actually be at least part of the answer.  I would get a kick out of Matt Y putting his beefs on this Blog, where everyone could see and where I could respond at my leisure, for everyone to see.  There is something about a written, rather than spoken word, which causes people to remember the idea that was communicated.  Additionally, it can be far more accurate, espcially when we are otherwise looking at a "he said, he said that so and so had said that......"  which is a complete waste of time for those at the end of the communication.  The basic issue that Matt Y is dealing with is that he is blind, so he has less to do and fewer ways of receiving stimulous or knowing what is going on.  His compensating mechanism, is to go verbal and try and increase his auditory stimulous.  But I don't think he knows how, or is willing to yet do that in a constructive way, so what he does is try to get people who have sight, fretting over everything that Matt cannot see.    As long as Jim is going to listen to Matt and pass it onto Chase or Doug, etc....Matt being the Pavovian Dog that he is, is  going to continue to attempt to drag actors into his drama by going to Jim with stuff that Matt needs to first work out in his own mind.   As Matt finds more to do, and Jim refuse to "bite" and listen to every little gripe, the problem will take care of itself.  Chase Ingersoll - chaseingersoll@yahoo.com

      I have come aboard the Recovery House Blog. This does not sound like a good thing. I guess like everything else, we eventually change our perspectives.  Thanks for the welcome. On one hand, I believe we need to have some level of patience with the guys that come into the house. Realizing that some "beefs" may be valid, even if only in their minds. At the same time we need to set boundries (as we have learned to do) and with compassion ask the resident(s) what they believe the next right step to be. They will likely come up with the right answer all by themselves. Eventually, they will be able to "self talk" and eliminate the middle man. We do need to resist the discussion of every little gripe and concern among each board member. This is counter-productive and will get worse as more residents come into the house. This wasn't so bad.....I guess I am looking forward to more blogging.  Doug.

      When it is mentioned that someone is still clinging to their own will, it reminds me of how I made zero progress; in fact, I made regress, until I finally decided that I didn't know anything, especially what was best for me.   It was only after surrendering as best I could, that I could even begin to see what was really important to me and how unbelievably better my life could be. It started for me by not having the burden of past recovery failures to extract "knowledge" from and explain how "I have been clean before, I know what to do already" at every turn. It's funny how good things happen and people are not all "against me" when I listen and take suggestions.   I was talking to another addict today, who was excited about a new job that pays $10.00 per hour. Enough to "pay all my bills, save money and get a computer and....." I said that was great, but $10.00 doesn't go as far as you might think, and, more importantly, if you don't work on yourself, you might as well make $1.00 an hour, for all the good it will do you. He seemed to think I was downing his job, or maybe he was pushing the whole "working on me" thing away.   It takes me to all the jobs, relationships, and material stuff I needed to be "ok". That never worked. What did work was realizing and becoming willing to look at ME, and my need for change. Today, I don't make a lot of money, have a hot girlfriend, or a place of my own. But what I have in the fellowship I belong to and the love and support of my higher power, is far more than I could have planned myself. I have learned some valuable lessons in recovery, one of the most important being "giving it away to keep it"; I give what I have to keep my life.

      You have no obligation to attend to, or even hear every little gripe that a resident might have.   You need to firmly establish boundaries with the guys that come in, and they need to dump this sort of stuff on somone outside the house.  First they accept and follow the rules and do their Recovery Program.  The ones that do that - you listen to those guys concerns. They are the ones making the effort to be functional.  The rest, tell them to go to meetings, take it up with their sponsor and then and only then, bring it to the house meeting on Sunday.  Then on Sunday the way they get played, is.....I'll hear their beef, and then I will ask them, what their sponsor thought about it......  The idea is not for everyone that lives there to dump their crap on everyone else that lives there.  They need to go to a meeting and dump that crap.  And that is the point regarding Matt Y.  If he is not using meetings and his sponsor for that function then what he is doing is hiding from the people, (myself, his sponor, Jim F, etc.) and then whining to you.  The only way to handle this for your and his benefit, is for you to give him the same response that we have given him - cut him short and send him back to step #1.  As long as someone around there will listen to his same old obsessions, he will continue to serve them.  You may or may not have noticed, but he has stopped whining to me.  This is because I take him right back to the crux of the matter, that he is angry at G O D and shutting God out of his life, particularly in his decision making process.  The boy wants to get up in the morning and begin doing things the way he wants to do them.  He is still neither desiring to do things God's way, nor is he seeking to know what that way is.  Until he does, he can just stew in his own juices, and we should feel no compunction, if we should respond to him with mockery about the fool with big plans and no serenity.   Being blind is no excuse for not doing the first things first.  He knows better.    Remind him that I think his speaking career is going to be a big joke, until he gets his butt into meetings regularly, shuts up and starts acquiring some more wisdom to share.   I have not heard his actual speach, but I'm gathering that it is a "Just Say No to Drugs", I had a bad life, but then I had something and I lost it all because I used.  Sorry, but I've told him, that doesn't do a hill of beans for kids.  They all know the dangers of drugs.  What they really need is to be shown how to question and analysze why they do them anyway, and practical behavioral tools as to HOW to say no to drugs and HOW to build their life and character despite bad influences, so that they can be a person that will say no to drugs.  I told Matt last week, he is NOT doing a program that is enabling him the self analysis, or the HOWS, so his is just another tragic story of obvious consequences, that the addict ignored.  And who needs to hear another one of those stories?  It's kind of like the old people that get together and talk about their various madical ailments.  That doesn't do me any good.  I want to hear from the 100 year old that is still hopping around, and I want to hear how HE DID IT!  Feel free to print this and have Matt's wife read it to him.  It will be blogged.  Chase

      I would like to offer a sincere Thank You to whoever is helping finish up 1214 Madison. That project has been quite tumultuous for a time. Much of the problem there is my fault, so I would also like to compensate you for your time as best I can.  Again, Thank you, it is greatly appreciated.    You can contact me by email if you like--na_rob1@yahoo.com    Or, by phone--(309) 472-8651    Rob B.

      Matt's being a good boy, Is there nothing to talk about? Just wondering.  Just thinking on a few days ago when Sir Chase offered his opinion on B Wolff, and that of a 300 plus LB crack whore. I can't help but to wonder if this type of situation happened to him seeing how he generally speaks on his opinions, claiming that they &nbsp;are based on first hand experiences.  Upon listening to some of these analogies/ opinions, I sometimes wonder just how sick this man really is, and if he talks about this type of sickness with his sponser...&nbsp; Just kidding...

      I hear everyone talking about the Big Book, and know what they are talking about. I feel as if my ignorance of the contents of this book leaves me feeling as if I am missing something. The glimpses of what is read in meetings is not enough. I need one of these books, especially now that I chair meetings at the wolff. What I am saying is that I need one of these books on tape, and the 12, and12 as well. Can anyone help, or at least give some ideas?

      Intergroup may have some info regarding the Big Book  audio version. I couldnt find the number in the new phone book. I'll look on the web.     I believe the founders that used the Biblical approach were the Oxford members. AA branched from that, relying more on the generic spiritual principles, in part, to attract those who were not attracted to the traditional God idea. Many of us have a history of "religous spirituality", that was very shallow, and served a surreal need. I know for me, I had to reevaluate everything I had ever known to be able to develop a true spiritual, not religous  base.     I often found myself being a "Sunday Christian", feeling as though I was phony, and unable to meet the unrealistic expectations presented. Through the fellowship of NA, I can develop a personal relationship with a Higher Power of my own understanding, not one of history's making.  The spiritual principles offered as Honesty, open-mindedness, and willingness were a great starting point for me. These principles also allow me to discover who I am, and who I want to grow to become.     I am grateful I am afforded the freedom to embark on a spiritual journey that is derived from the awareness, conscience, and therapeutic value of one addict helping another, rather than from dogma recited and evaluated by man.     There are many routes one can take to develop spirituality, I would encourage anyone to take the path that works best for them. The Basic Text speaks of addicts "floating away on a cloud of religous zeal", and I know I have been there, done that. It is quite easy for an addict to grip on to whatever feels good at the moment, closing off other possibilities. Search for what makes sense to "me", and what gives "me " the guidance and comfort I need to live. A Higher Power, as suggested to me, needs to be bigger than me, loving and caring, and always available.

      It is on the web at:    http://www.recovery.org/aa/bigbook/ww/    Actually the Big Book that was refered to b the founders, was the Bible.   The founders also stated that meetings were not necessary, but daily reading of the bible and prayer and meditation were mandatory.    I have the Alexander Scourby dramatized version of the Bible on CD.  I will get it too you.  I suggest that you listen to the First books of Genesis, Job and the portion of the gospels containing Christs temptation in the wilderness.  They give Satan a really far out, wicked, electro sounding voice.    I don't know what you think, will make you happy.  Growing is painful, but it is part of the process.  You will get to the point where you will just be happy where ever you are when you are just happy for another day and another chance with other people, to experience each other and grow beyond the person(s)  you were the day before.

      I have never experienced anything like what I have been through these last couple of days. I have never lived, or been this close to someone quarling like Jim, and I have been and worked it out. The fact of the matter is, I think that we are going to be fine. I wouldn't have been able to post this if it weren't for him. Yes, my computer locked up while I was attempting to make a copy of a cd. I got it to re- boot, but there was no sound coming from the damn thing, therefore leaving it speechless. I could not use it with out it talking. As hard as I tried to do it myself, I had to admit defeat, and in turn, surrender. I honestly believed that Jim would tell me to go ride my cane when I asked him for help, but I was surprised that he didn't.   He sat down, and within minutes, my computer started chirping, and once again,  I was over whelmed with gratitude. Thanks Jim.     &nbsp;  I believed that I over reacted, and I admit that the things that I said was an immature ploy to get back at Jim for all of the reasons that we know. I have learned a lot from this whole thing, and I hope that we could attempt too refurbish our relationship. I would also like to thank you for installing the phone in my room.     &nbsp;  Being honest, I hate it here, and then I can't say that. Consequenses are slappingt the shit out of me now for the things that I did in the past. They say that things are supposed to get better, and I believe that they will.     &nbsp;  I came right out of prison, and went right into the whole. I don't see myself climbing out of it any time soon. I don't hate it here, I hate that I have to live in the mess that I created long ago. It has all started to come back to haunt me, and I don't know what to do. What ever happens, I will stay sober. Using is not an option.. Thank God for this program.

      Discussing on this blog, or wherever may not  breaking their anonymity, but it is gossip, and does none of us any good. People can see for themselves the insanity other's display, it shouldn't be wasting space on anyone's monitor.    The Big Book does talk about this issue, check it out.

      I am really enjoying using this blog to discuss how dysfunctional Beewolf is.........don't forget that anonymity is in regards to what someone says in a meeting, and not in regards to the stuff that theyy are saying and doing outside meetings.       I'm sure all of you would have some poingant examples of specific behavior outside of meetings that is "...not exactly big book coordinated..."    Chase Ingersoll

       Greetings.......my computer has been on the Fritz the last few days, and somehow I have come to the realization that this was not a bad thing.&nbsp; I didn't have the patience nor inclination to read the "vomit" back and forth between residents at the recovery house.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were a couple of really good posts lately and I commend Jimmy the Rat for finding the Third Step prayer.&nbsp;&nbsp; The comments about Beewolf were, for the most part, true.&nbsp; I tend to look past a lot of&nbsp;the negative&nbsp;things there.&nbsp;&nbsp;If nothing else, my patience and tolerance has been tested and I prevailed.&nbsp; Now,&nbsp;if I don't hear something someone says......Maybe God didn't need for me to hear&nbsp;that at that moment anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I am the worst offender of working the crossword puzzle&nbsp;during a meeting.&nbsp; I find I can actually listen more intently while doing something like this.&nbsp; Call it multi-tasking. Call it a symptom of ADDHD.&nbsp;&nbsp;Call it what you will.&nbsp; I do it quietly and don't harm anyone.&nbsp; The real crux of the matter is, that after almost 6 years, I don't find myself hanging on every word said anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp;    Beewolf is a place that enabled me to find the help that I needed.&nbsp; Sometimes the help that I needed was within.&nbsp; Sometimes the help was in the form of a higher power.&nbsp; Many times the help was found in the people around the tables who (were and are) still struggling.&nbsp;&nbsp;Possibly the most important form of help came in the form of honest - "I've been where you are and here is what happened to me".&nbsp; This is a place that helped me save my life.&nbsp; I get somewhat&nbsp;inscenced about folks who slam the place and advize others not to go there.&nbsp; The big book talks about "contempt prior to investigation".&nbsp;&nbsp; Possibly the best lines written on the blog since I have been reading it are:     &nbsp;    I personally have heard much wisdom, insight and have often observed much kindness, humility and truthfulness at Beewolf. &nbsp;     &nbsp;   And, of course I love seeing the 3rd step prayer as well - thanks Jimmy!

      Basically Beewolf is a great place and has helped my in the past and still will in the future.&nbsp; I can accept the romper room atmosphere; people talking while the meeting is in progress.&nbsp; People working crossword puzzles during meeting but I have learned to accept that as part of the Beewolf experience.&nbsp; On a positive side it’s the long-term sobriety and for me the new comer sharing his or her pain, flustration, sadness, guilt reminds me of my past using experiences.&nbsp; I like going to Beewolf meetings and will continue sharing my opinions, stuff, aspirations, experiences, faith, hope and sometimes wisdom. The old AA saying of taking what you need and leave the rest is what I believe.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

      I have found that when I have spoken my peace and someone still does not understand, the best thing for me to do is shut up and stop the verbal communication.    Silence is a Loud Speaker.    Just move on.  If someone continues to beat the dead cat, it is obviously still bugging them and they should continually obsess about it until they are tired of it.  You need not continue to obsess about their obsessing.   You really do not have time, as there are three other very interesting, albeit less animated young fellows there, whom you can be a blessing to regardless of whether or not someone thinks that staying out all night, or not cleaning your room is a serious character defect.    Likewise, the other fellow has people whom he can be of benefit, so I will continue to assist them in that in any way that I can.  You all may be imperfect chipped cups, but I see all of you are able to hold water (and piss and vinegar) and all of you are able, and I believe are, contributing positively to the recovery community if in no other way than by showing how despite our faults and the faults of others around us......we can stay clean and sober.

      Yes, I am hurt about what was said, but it goes much further than that.  I was not joking when I said that I like Jim. I seriously do. I think that he is a valuable asset to the recovery house, and I appreciate his wisdom. I am more concerned aabout his safety , than his room being clean.   Even Jim F., a prosperous man employed by I.D.O.C. for 16 years, a successful father, husband, and member of A.A. enjoyijng 14 years of sobriety. Obviously a rational thinker. Even he said that if what was said to him what was said to me by Jim G. out on our front porch, would have led to a fight, no a beat down. I am refering to the accusation of sucking dick for rock.  What Jim needs to realize is that life is a two way street. If you respect, you get respected. If you disrespect, then you get disrespected, and so on. New members in this house are not going to respect what he says, but what he does. Respect, the basis of which all positive relationships are built.   he also needs to realize that because he is 64, house manager, educated, none of that is going to save him when he makes remarks like he did to me, to someone who just doesn't care.&nbsp;  It seems like Jims clenliness issues are a big deal, but living by example is the bigger issue for a person living here with his title. I want Jim to&nbsp;own up for what he said, and did to me. Then I want him to work on his own issues which led up to these actions. I feel like if&nbsp;I just let this go, I am enableing these situations arise once again, if not with me, then with someone else. That someone else&nbsp;may not deal with all of this as well as I have. They just might hurt Jim.   I admit that wanting Jim&nbsp;to own his shit that he pulled on me is personal, but wanting to address&nbsp;these issues, and then work on thim is purelyy for the good of Jim, and the residents currently residing, and the ones yet to come to the recovery house.

         I like Beewolf. It is proof that you can sit in a smoke filled room........ where at any moment someone still smelling of booze, but suffering from the DT's can stumble in, or a three hundred lbs crack whore sneaks in to hide from her pimp that pulled into the gas station across the street, only to see her pimp from a year ago, accepting a 1 year clean and sober coin.......and experience a serene view of the breadth and color of recovery.      Beeolf is where the recovery rubber meets the road, for the good, the bad and the ugly, and Beewolf has them all, in every shape, size, color and sexual orientation.      It it also, the best evidence that no matter how bad the dysfunctional behaviors around you, there are always roses amongst the thorns and nutrients in the cesspool of life and that each day, our free will is blessed with both good and bad examples to follow.      Yes, Beewolf needs more people with positive perspectives, but I kind of like the fact that people who want to dump their garbage, have a place to go and do it, where they also have to sit there and listen to others who are interested in dumping their garbage.      I personally have heard much wisdom, insight and have often observed much kindness, humility and truthfulness at Beewolf.      Chase Ingersoll

      1.  You are both talking rather than beating each other, and unpleasant as some of your sentiments may be for you and the person who is the brunt of your sentiments, honest expression is a necessary step along the road to accurate expression and appropriate expression.    2.  What you are both dealing with is developing appropriate boundaries for your own actions, and where to draw the lines with other people.  Your reactions and ramblings are all too familiar to what I experienced more than a decade ago, and then have observed in other people in the recovery process.  Right now you are both at a place where you are just "...getting it all out...."     and it is sort of like vomit.  You need to get it all out.  It makes you feel better.  But it is a nasty smelly mess for anyone around, and it is particulary nasty for the person standing in front of you.   That is why I prefer to stay at my house and comment on the blog.  Also, I cannot stand the smell of hamburger.    3.  The Divine author of life has place you in front of Jim, and Jim in front of you.   I truly believe that for some reason, you deserve and need Jim's vomit and that for some reason, Jim needs and deserves yours.    I would suggest that the two of you sit down with each other and discuss your past experiences and behaviors, (...ones before you ever moved into the house...) and see if you can each identify what it is in you and your pasts that has contributed to the way that you look at and react to each other.      Again, it is becoming more and more obvious to all of us out here, that the two of you are precisely what the other needs.   Specifically, you might ask yourselves, why it is so hard for you to let go when you beleive someone has made a false statement about you.  I think that would be an appropriate starting point for your "...sharing and caring..." dialouge with each other.    Chase Ingersoll

      Anonymity is the spiritual foundation of all our traditions, ever reminding us to place principles before  personalities.    What is important is the message, not the messenger. I had a guy once in treatment tell me all about myself. He couldn't do for himself what he told others to do, but he helped me immensely, because I looked at me, not him.     Beewolf........nuff  said.

      I woke up this morning feeling great. I went to the kitchen, fried me a hamburger patty, and some eggs. There were a few dishes that needed to be washed so I washed them. I came back up stairs, picked up my room, and &nbsp;made my bed. It is great to be alive and sober.   In response to Johns checking in. So are we supposed to check in with Jim, or anyone in the house. The night before, John called and let me know that he was not going to be in by mid night. I told other members in the house. Good job John.  The first time that I went out for a night on the town, I told no one what I was up to. It was brought to my attention that I was disrespectful by doing so, so the second time I went out....  I left the house at approx. 9:30 p.m. No one was home, but Scott. I made him aware of my plans, and then left. I apoligize that I could not tell him where I was going to end up. I did not know exactly where we planned to fish. I did say I would not go anywhere without letting someone know where I was, but my ignorance of the exact location made this impossible. Once again, my commitment to all is that I will not go out in the late hours. That problem should now be eliminated.   &nbsp;Jim, I find it awfully amusing that you can't remember what you had said just the day before, but can remember intimate details of the weeks before. Do you suffer from amnesia, or selective memory.   No, you don't have to apoligize to the people of the wolff, I was attempting to suggest that you start off with an apoligy for offering the wrong information about one of their fellow addicts, and friend. I agree with you about meetings being a place to dump baggage, but be prepared to accept the concequenses as you are for this last incident. At the same time, the recovery house is supposed to be a safe place to keep away from drugs and alcohol. No one is disputing that, but no one likes to have their dirty laundry out in the open. This allows people to conform predjedicial ideas, and stereo types without even knowing that person. A person certainly does not want people saying things about them that is not true. When this false, and dirty laundry laundry is broad casted by the house manager&nbsp;of this program, it looks bad on the house manager. Especially when claiming to be as serene in his program like you do. Second of all,&nbsp;when you are pulling&nbsp;this stunt, you are punching holes in the recovery house with out realizing it. What you have done is bad for the A.A. program, to the Recovery House's program, and to your own program.   You said that your personal&nbsp;program is none of my concern, I can agree with that, but when your lack of program is affecting me as a member of this house, it is my concern. House issues are my concern when I live here. I know that you don't have a problem throwing a dirty cup in the sink. I also know that you don't have a problem letting the sink get full of those dirty cups, and not washing them. Therefore putting that burden on someone else to wash your dirty dishes. I am not saying that every one else does not do the same, but every one else washes the dishes.   I bring this up for one reason. As addicts, we lived where people said, and promised tons of things, but never followed through with those. Therefore, we learned not to listen to what we have heard, but what we have seen. People say just about anything, but do no where what they say. So we have learned to respect, and trust what they do, not what they say.   Jim, you verbally demand respect because of your position as house manager. Residents may try to get along with you because they have to live here, but respecting you is another thing. We feel like you think that you do not have to do a thing around here because of your position. Whether that is true, or not is on you. It is obvious that you talk big program, but don't live it.   Before I go any further, I should address your invitation, and claim to settle this face to face because you claim that using this media is not beneficial.  Beneficial to who? You? When I first logged on to this web site, I was apalled at what I found. All of this conversation was taking place about me, and I never had a chance to defend myself. Nevertheless, I had to look at these conversationss, and evaluate if the information was true or not. Then I had to look at the issues that were true, and change in those areas. After doing so, I found that the blog spot was abandoned for nearly a week. Matt yeater changed so that there was nothing to talk about? You claim that this form of interaction is not beneficial, why? These people talking about me, along with the program, forced a change on me that is nearly undescribable. Sure, I have some issues that are lurking around, but having them put out in the open has forced me to look at those issues, and then confront them.   So once again, who is this not beneficial too? You? Could it be that you want to talk about these issues face to face so that they won't be dragged out in the open. You, or anyone else on this blog didn't think about that before I figured out how to get on this thing. Regardless, I am thankful for the opportunity to take a closer look at my carachter defects. Why, now that when someone is talking about yours, do you want to talk face to face? When I first got on here, I felt like I was being ganged up on. What i have learned is that no one is ganging up on anyone, just offering their suggestions, and opinions.  Sorry Jim, but before we can talk face to face, we need to settle this blog to blog. Why, because I have learned that the Jim that Chase, doug, and Rob, knows, and has come to love, is not the Jim that I know, or who the other residents knows. In fact, they are two different people. The Jim that they know, has it all together. The Jim that we know does not..   You can get angry, I did, but when this blog spot came to my attention, I sat here and worked steps one, two, and three. I admitted that i was powerless over this situation. The anger was bring me to a point of insanity, so I asked God to restore my sanity. Then by turning my will, and life over to him, brought an uncontrolable change over me. Then, looking at the conversations, and the issues at hand, I did a nini- fourth step. Then I admitted all off those defects to my sponser. When I showed this web site to him before we had our meeting, he had no idea of what I had done, meaning working the steps over this situation.. I should have because my reaction during this meeting made him feel like I turned on him. After explaining what ai did all day sitting in front of this computer, he understood, and displayed thee surprise, and later informed me that he was impressed, and told me that I had helped him without even knowing it.  What I am saying ids that you don't have a problem airing your information and suspicions of us on this blog, or in meetings. I will not discuss your shit in a meeting because I do not feel like that is right. However, I am going to put it out there like you do me with hopes that it will help you like it did me.   The program is not just about staying sober, but changing the way that we live so that we can remain sober. It is about conforming a program to help us deal with life on life's terms so that we may live a happyy, and sober life. I just think that you are so caught up with bigger issues that you are not able to look at the smaller issues which are the foundation of which we stand.   So when you get up, make your bed. Clean your room. Go down stairs make you some coffee, and cook you a few eggs. If you need help learning how to cook, I will teach you. Then wash your dishes. If there are other dishes in the sink, wash them too. It only takes a couple of minutes. Creating sovernty through out your life creates a happyness that is undescribeable. It brings a reconizeable glow about a person. do you know who sees it first? Women. Yes, Lots of women.....&nbsp;

I am not saying that every one else does not do the same, but every one else washes the dishes.   I bring this up for one reason. As addicts, we lived where people said, and promised tons of things, but never followed through with those. Therefore, we learned not to listen to what we have heard, but what we have seen. People say just about anything, but do no where what they say. So we have learned to respect, and trust what they do, not what they say.   Jim, you verbally demand respect because of your position as house manager. Residents may try to get along with you because they have to live here, but respecting you is another thing. We feel like you think that you do not have to do a thing around here because of your position. Whether that is true, or not is on you. It is obvious that you talk big program, but don't live it.   Before I go any further, I should address your invitation, and claim to settle this face to face because you claim that using this media is not beneficial.  Beneficial to who? You? When I first logged on to this web site, I was apalled at what I found. All of this conversation was taking place about me, and I never had a chance to defend myself. Nevertheless, I had to look at these conversationss, and evaluate if the information was true or not. Then I had to look at the issues that were true, and change in those areas. After doing so, I found that the blog spot was abandoned for nearly a week. Matt yeater changed so that there was nothing to talk about? You claim that this form of interaction is not beneficial, why? These people talking about me, along with the program, forced a change on me that is nearly undescribable. Sure, I have some issues that are lurking around, but having them put out in the open has forced me to look at those issues, and then confront them.   So once again, who is this not beneficial too? You? Could it be that you want to talk about these issues face to face so that they won't be dragged out in the open. You, or anyone else on this blog didn't think about that before I figured out how to get on this thing. Regardless, I am thankful for the opportunity to take a closer look at my carachter defects. Why, now that when someone is talking about yours, do you want to talk face to face? When I first got on here, I felt like I was being ganged up on. What i have learned is that no one is ganging up on anyone, just offering their suggestions, and opinions.  Sorry Jim, but before we can talk face to face, we need to settle this blog to blog. Why, because I have learned that the Jim that Chase, doug, and Rob, knows, and has come to love, is not the Jim that I know, or who the other residents knows. In fact, they are two different people. The Jim that they know, has it all together. The Jim that we know does not..   You can get angry, I did, but when this blog spot came to my attention, I sat here and worked steps one, two, and three. I admitted that i was powerless over this situation. The anger was bring me to a point of insanity, so I asked God to restore my sanity. Then by turning my will, and life over to him, brought an uncontrolable change over me. Then, looking at the conversations, and the issues at hand, I did a nini- fourth step. Then I admitted all off those defects to my sponser. When I showed this web site to him before we had our meeting, he had no idea of what I had done, meaning working the steps over this situation.. I should have because my reaction during this meeting made him feel like I turned on him. After explaining what ai did all day sitting in front of this computer, he understood, and displayed thee surprise, and later informed me that he was impressed, and told me that I had helped him without even knowing it.  What I am saying ids that you don't have a problem airing your information and suspicions of us on this blog, or in meetings. I will not discuss your shit in a meeting because I do not feel like that is right. However, I am going to put it out there like you do me with hopes that it will help you like it did me.   The program is not just about staying sober, but changing the way that we live so that we can remain sober. It is about conforming a program to help us deal with life on life's terms so that we may live a happyy, and sober life. I just think that you are so caught up with bigger issues that you are not able to look at the smaller issues which are the foundation of which we stand.   So when you get up, make your bed. Clean your room. Go down stairs make you some coffee, and cook you a few eggs. If you need help learning how to cook, I will teach you. Then wash your dishes. If there are other dishes in the sink, wash them too. It only takes a couple of minutes. Creating sovernty through out your life creates a happyness that is undescribeable. It brings a reconizeable glow about a person. do you know who sees it first? Women. Yes, Lots of women.....&nbsp;

      Matt,  &nbsp;  I would suggest that you re-read Chases post today on what is the purpose of Recovery House and return to the focus.  &nbsp;  I don’t feel I owe Beewolf an apology for anything I said or did.&nbsp; Beewolf is a place to dump my stuff and I will continue using it for that purpose as well as listening to everyone sharing. If they don’t like it they can go back to cross-talking and reading newspapers.&nbsp; I did not lie but I don’t remember if I said 17 hours, 48hours or 100 hours because I was upset with myself mainly.&nbsp; The point it that you were gone without telling anyone where you were.&nbsp; Did you tell anyone of your friends that you were gone for 17hrs and this was the second time this has happened? Remember you promised after the first incident that you were sorry for being so inconsiderate and it would never happen again but you did it again. So my friend who is lying?????  &nbsp;  Your response about the phone didn’t mention the hazard of it being across the steps.&nbsp; Mark, Scott and I almost tripped on it.&nbsp; The long cable is very functional if it is placed properly so no one will become injured.&nbsp; My comments are directed to you behavior and not to your recovery program.&nbsp; My recovery program is none of you concern nor should it be but our reactions to house situations are.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I will continue recovery topics here using this media as well in this house to anyone that will listen.&nbsp; I will also continue Recovery House Issues when I go to meetings if I feel the need to do so.&nbsp; In Recovery House there is no anonymity and there is none at Beewolf either which has been demonstrated often.  &nbsp;  Further discussion on these and other past issues will not be beneficial using this media.&nbsp; If you want to discuss anything that is bothering you I’m available.&nbsp;

      Jim, I never said that you were a bad guy. I did, and still do appreciate you with helping my family, and I&nbsp; out. If you think that I don't, you're wrong. I like you, I really do, but I will not sugar coat, or enable your behavior.   I am very angry that you went to that meeting yesterday, and yelled out your suspicions to every one. I am much more angry that you said that I stayed gone for 48 hours to cast your suspicions of me getting high on every one else. No one told me that stuf to break your ananimaty, but to find out what is going on with me. When I was asked what was happening, I told them. Not to make you look bad, but to assure them that I was not using. Then they went from pointing a finger at me, to pointing them back at you. Something too remember, When anyone is pointing a finger at anyone, at least three are pointing back at them...  You do not have to apoligize to me to begin making things right, you might want to consider making an apology to the group for lying. I am not going to sit back and let these people think that I relapsed to protect you from what most of these people now feel about you. You must know that you in the position that you are in with being the recovery house's house manager, and doing that, not only made you look bad, but the house as well.This whole conflict is now the talk of B' Wolff.   I was wrong&nbsp;for staying out late like that, and not being totally informative like I should have. You were the only one that made a mess out of it. So to correct that problem, I am not going to stay out like that anymore.   As for the phone cord.&nbsp;I am not the only one who appreciates that item. We all do. Well those of us who don't have a cordless phone in their&nbsp;room. I did not buy that for just me.   As for the&nbsp;respect issue with the phone, whenever someone calls for someone, I get off it. Thank&nbsp;God for call waiting. When anyone needs to&nbsp;use it, I say my good byes, and get off promptly. As for the conflict between us residents, we have that settled,&nbsp;and we did that without accusing each other of nonsence, or&nbsp;broad casting those issues at a meeting.   Speaking of broad casting at a meeting. People are coming up to me and telling me that they are tired of hearing about this place within a meeting. I agree with these people, The issues of this house should not be brought to the meeting, but to a sponser.   Asn for the immaturity, You getting mad and taking your radio back was immature. What you were saying on the porch, was immature. There were two other people that heard these words of yours, and only God knows who else. One of them lives here, the other just visits. Not even a resident.   I am sorry Jim, but I am not going to kiss your ass. It doesn't matter what you did before your addiction, like wise with mine. The point is that we are both addicts, and have to live under the same roof. Either we are, or we aren't. If we are, we have to respect each other. You have to give it to get it. I am not talking about staying out all night, but by living by example.   Further, you are the house manager/ observer. Every one knows that you report to Chase. Every one is fine with that. What we do not agree with is you preaching recovery, but not living it. Change is an important part of recovery. That means every thing. From the smallest, to the largest issues. If you never made your bed with in your addiction, you need to make it every day. Start small. We didn't become addicted in one day, so remember, easy does it. (Taken from the N.A. How it works). I am not trying to bash you Jim, but you have a few issues that you need to work on before you try to point out other peoples &nbsp;shit. All that rational, or irrational bullshit is not going to make your bed, clean your room, cook you food, or clean up after you.   You are 64, and you have 40 years on me. I know that, but at the same time, I know about some shit. I have been through a lot to Jim. I am not claiming to have all of the answers. I have a lot of shit that is kicking my ass, but I am working on them. I am able to do that because I am accepting the thoughts, and suggestions of others. I do not want to fight with you. I won't.   Awaiting a response....

      Matt,  &nbsp;  I would like to take this opportunity to apologize to you with respect to the verbal abuse.&nbsp; One of my old character defects when someone gets under my skin I verbally attack then in the way I did to you the other day. If after you read this response and you want to discuss other issues face to face I am agreeable to that possibility.&nbsp; As you know we all are fallible human beings and make mistakes.&nbsp; You and I can go on and on with this or we can reach a compromise in feelings and the behavior with respect to them.  &nbsp;  I would like to comment on you post what is really going on  &nbsp;  When you first entered the house I tried my best to support your needs. If you remember I drove you out to pick up your family and also supplied transportation to the airport when your wife left.&nbsp; The reason I did this was to support a fellow house member and I still the same way about everyone here. There are certain time constraints that I have for such activity.&nbsp; We in this house are a family and must be sensitive about what goes on here day to day.&nbsp; It may appear to be a very minor thing about the phone but before changes are made in anyway they should be discussed with all house members and then an equable solution is arrived at with the approval of all members of the house.&nbsp; It started when you bought a long cord and attached it without discussing it with me.&nbsp; I live here also and when things are moved around or modifications made it would be nice to know about it in advance. Having a cord on the stairs is a hazard and I tripped on it my self and almost fell.&nbsp; You also spend a lot of time on the phone while others are expecting calls or want to make them.  &nbsp;  Well Matt nothing is going on but people have feelings and different opinions on many issues.&nbsp; What I can do it help rectify and calm this situation is too install a phone in your room in addition to the house phone. There is justification for this because of your disability. The only problem I see is the where is the phone and who is going to pay for it.&nbsp; I purchased the house phone at the dollar store for $10.00.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  In your post in addition to many other things you mentioned a change in your missing in action behavior.&nbsp; I would congratulate you for being so perceptive and not continuing to bring suspicion on yourself with incongruous actions on your part.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;

      Matt:   I understand perfectly well that you needed to talk to your wife in private.    I also understand that others may have needed to use the phone and that others may have been concerned about someone tripping over phone cord in the hallway.    But in the emotional frame of mind that you were in, you were focused on what was bothering you.  Meanwhile the others focused on what was irritating them as regarding their not getting what they wanted in the phone, the cord in the hallway, etc.    Kids, when everyone focuses on what they need, or what they think is most important, things get blown out of proportion and we have all of this chaos.      It doesn't have to be this way..............but it was........and maybe it needs to be for you all to realize that people may not be using drugs, but we are still very much about what we want and need, rather than others wants and needs.   And I want and need for you all to get along.....    I go back to my point about the focus of the house.  Once you have Recovery House as your home, if you are to find serenity there, you must turn your focus from your needs to the needs of those who are in a situation much worse than yours.  Obviously you are not, and cannot be focusing on others when you are quarrelling amongst each other.    No one in the house has treated any other in any way that is unforgivable.  All that we have done, is hurt each others feelings, and then communicated our hurt feelings in ways that only made the situation worse.   In the past, any of you could have run away, gotten high or punched someone out.  None of that happened, so despite how riduculous this whole drama seems to me, I am pleased that no-one did anything that required any action by the board.    Matt: it is dysfunctional for someone, especially someone with a disability, let alone an addiction to run off and not tell the people he lives with, precisely where he is going, who he is going to be with, when he can be expected to return, and how he can be reached where he is at.  It is especially inappropriate in your situation, because you are a husband and father, your wife is out of town, and if some sort of an emergency should happen, how would it be for her, or your father or grandmother if they were to call the house and the best anyone could tell them was "...Matt said he was going fishing..."    "...All night?!...." asks Grandma.    Then your father gets on the phone, and says something to the effect of "....that's a bunch of BS...". and accuses the person on the phone of covering for your engaging in some inappropriate behavior.       Are you getting an idea, as to the kind of risk of repercusions to which  your actions expose the people most involved in your day to day living?    That sort of behavior may have been par for the course in a family with a bunch of abusive addicts and alcoholics, but it is not the way a normal, happy family works and when one member of the family does something like that, it concerns, worries and hurts the others, just as Greg's going out caused pain to all of you.    And as you have seen, when you live with addicts, and cause them have worries, concerns and hurt feelings, they do not tend to react well, and in turn will say things that hurt your feelings.   And in this case, if we are to analyze this whole situation, the starting point was your actions.  Could the rest have reacted better?  Sure.  But is that for you to demand that they respond better to your actions?  No.  You can no more demand that they not be concerned or suspicious of you, than they can demand that you not stay out all night or at least be more specific about where you are going, who you are with and how long.    But since your last post, expresses your exasperation and exhaustion from this whole conflict, just think about the effect that your actions have on others and the serenity of the house as a whole.   If you do that, then you will lead others in the same direction.    Now off to bed,  You blind dick-head

      Matt, if you are not using, you need to recite the short version of the serenity prayer--"F@#k  em". Everyone is not going to like you, nor you everyone else. Al l this struggle does is keep you from looking at you, which is the most important thing. While you can learn how you handle yourself in various relationships, the exercise is fruitless when it comes to trying to determine who's wrong or right, good or evil.     Some people will invariably refuse to look at their own shit, ourselves included at times. You can't change that, except how you look at your stuff. These things you are going through might bring up some real issues in time for you to learn from. Good to read that you see that a little. Stay open minded , honest, and willing. Someone will be happy to talk smack about you long after Jim is done, so be flattered, and don't be like the person you are butting   h eads with, whoever it is now or in the future. Aspire to be YOU, not who you've always believed you were, but, rather, who you know you can become as a recovering addict.    Not as peotic as the previous blogs, but then, that was too much info for this addict to sort through to find the meat. It doesn't matter why you are the way you are, what is important is how you change that.

      I am sore. I don't understand what brought all of this on. All i wanted to do was use the phone in privacy to talk to my wife. Maybe this has been coming to a head for a while. I am not sure. I do know that I am very disappointed in what I heard when i went to the six o' clock meeting. I understand that there is no ananimity within this house. I understand why. What i don't understand is why Jim went to the noon meeting and told everyone that he had suspicions of a person living in the recovery house was using. He also said that this person had a disability. He set his false aligations out on me in the rooms. I feel like he had no right to do that. Thank God that there are people within those rooms that care enough about me to ask me what is really going on. While talking to these people, I was told that Jim said that I stayed away from this house for 48 hours. He was quoted saying that and that when he stayed gone for 2 days, he knew what he was doing. I was not gone like that. This is a lie. I can't understand&nbsp;why Jim would say this.  &nbsp; I give up. I can't do this. I have more important things to worry about than the he said shit. I am sick over this. I don't want to fight or argue. That is  why I got&nbsp;sober because I couldn't live like this anymore. If the issue is really about me going and hanging out, I have made a commitment to myself, to my wife, and now I am making a commitment to you. I will not go hang out in the late hours. I have been locked up for the last two years, and I just want a little freedom. I didn't mean to disrespect anyone. For some reason, I dont think that this is what this is entirely about. I don't have a clue. I am not using drugs, if you think that I am, drug test me. I am more than willing.    &nbsp;  What it all boils down to is this: Jim, do what you're going to do, say what you feel that you need to say. I am done with defending myself, I no longer care what you, or anyone else has to say about me. I know what is true, and what isn't. I am worrying about me, and my program. I am going to do what it takes to change my life, and if I can, help others. I from now on, refuse to get involved with this crap.     &nbsp;  I am done....

      Last night I tried to get on and tell my side of the story. When i tried to publish,  I found that the server could not be found. Maybe it was irrational to believe that Jim disconnected my line, but with the accusations that were made about me using, I believed that he could have unplugged the line to keep me from finding out what he had posted. As for the immaturity, there were a couple of witnesses to what Jim had to say to me. Along with those words, I was accused of going out and sucking cock for rock.&nbsp; Ha, ha....    &nbsp;  I could sit here an embarrase the hell out of our fearless leader, but I will let that dog sit. I am ok with the way King jim feels today. I owe that to the program. However, if there are any more shots fired by Jim, I will retaliate, and do the best that I can to make Jim look like a fool, not just on this blog, but in the entire public. Why? Because he did me by accusing me of sucking dick for dope in the wide open on the front porch. I will publiclly humiliate him if he wants to act that way in the open. This is a warning for future references. You must know that what you see, and what we have seen, are two different things. I could sit here and put our house manager on blast on the internet, but I feel like I am above that today, but I will not be the next time that he wants to attempt to make a fool out of me.     &nbsp;  Jim feels like I should be drug tested. For the record, Let's go. When ever anyone wants to go have it done. gas up the truck. If for any reason that person feels like I passed this test by the skin of my teeth,, I agree to a hair folical test. Just pull the bus up out front, and I will go. It is not a problem. So Jim, Shove your suspicion up your old ass.    &nbsp;  Upon the conversation that I had with the rat today, I was informed that I was to go screw myself. I was told that I was not to ask him for anything, and that is fine with me. I feel as if all of this is because of the phone. In my opinion, this is pathetic. Chase, the reason that I called you after Jim and I's conversation was because Jim threatened that if I was gon for hours at a time, I was going to be kicked out, and I would not be allowed to return. I was trying to ask if I needed to leave. From here on out, I will not discuss any issue that I have with the rat. I would appreciate it if you, or the board talked to me before I am forced to leave. I sincerely hope that Jim will get over this petty issue, and quit reacting by making false accusations. I believe that he knows that drug use on my behalf is his ace in the hole. I know that Jim wants me gone. I hope that this is reckonized by everyone and kept in the back of their mind when he makes these fruitless allegations. I would also hope that Jim would do a complete fourth step, if he has not already, to attempt to figure out these carachter deefects. Once that has been complete, I hope that he would attempt to gain a grasp on these, and make a few changes in his life. If you would like an outside opinion Jim, I would gladly be of assistance. It would seem as if I am taking a shot at Jim, but sometimes it is easier to have these things pointed out rather than looking at them from your own perspective. I am speaking from experience. Some times I need some one to tell me that I need some improvement in a few areas. Right Chase????

      No-one took the "...I'm going fishing..." statement seriously enough for it to be even a weak attempt to deceive anyone.  Frankly the statement and the manner in which it was said, was very much an invitation and deliberate provocation for others to ask what was going on, and in this case, I think that this was actually Matt's intent...........    Frequently people are that way.  They do not just come out and tell you that they want to talk about something they are doing, they do it and describe in a poetic way so as to see whether or not you are interested enough to care.    Jim, you had three sons.  If they were not certain as to whether or not you would be interested in what they were doing, rather than just coming out and telling you what they were up to, they would put it in a cryptic sort of way.  If you were interested, that would only further wet your curiousity.  If you didn't care, it was not like they had come to you with a great outward expression of how much they wanted your attention and then got ignored.    I don't think it at all strange that with the rejection that Matt has experienced in his short life, particularly from his Parental figures that he would not be patterning communication in this fashion.   It has nothing to do with dishonesty towards you or relapsing.  It has to do with the pain of rejection that he suffered as a child.    You [Jim] on the other hand, are still deeply wounded from a nine year, spousal relationship with a woman that deliberately lied to you and used you to enable her addiction.  The fact that you are sensitive to any type of communication that is not 100% direct and are hypervigilant in regards to the possibility of untruthfulness and staying out all night is direct evidence of that.    But Matt is not your ex-wife.  And he and others will exhibit behaviors that may remind you of old circumstances, and while to a degree similar, those behaviors have different causes, different effects and an entirely different meaning for different people.    Now getting to the rational and irrational, it may be perfectly irrational for Matt to accuse you of having unplugged his internet connection, but if you evaluate where Matt is at, it is probably rational for you to assume that Matt would take your reaction to his night out and irrationally assume that you would play some kind of game with him.   Based upon his past experience of suffering abuse at the hand of parental figures, (read in Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) Matt is going to anticipate that criticism and disagreement with such a figure is going to result in some sort of blind sided retaliation by that figure.  Accordingly, anything that goes wrong with anything that you might remotely have some control over, it is a natural reaction for him to suspect that the causation is of your opportunity and motive.     Bottom line is both of you are analyzing and reacting to each other, based upon how other people have treated you, and there is nothing that I can do about that.  That is something that the two of you are going to have to come to terms with and Matt is going to have to begin thinking and acting like Jimmy has Matt's best interest at heart, and Jimmy is going to have to begin thinking and acting like Matt has Jimmy's best interest at heart.    I know Matt is not going to relapse.  And I know that you did not unplug Matt's DSL.  But as the only totally rational person among the three of us, I also know that you are both a couple of sick bastards that are going to bug the crap out of me every time that the two of you get paranoid about each other, and I really do not have time for that.  So in the future, this is how we are going to handle it:  Blog the problem for a couple of days.   Matt, if you think that Jimmy has cut your DSL so that you cannot blog your side, call me and I will make sure your access to the blog is unfettered.  If we cannot blog oursleves to a resolution, I suggest that each of you go to a meeting and then talk to your sponsors.  If that does not resolve the problem, I will sit down with both of you and talk to both of you at the same time.  However, everyone will be invited to see the discussion that I have with you, and the two of you will have to sit, with Matt on Jimmy's knee (because Jimmy thinks that Matt needs to grow up)  and with both of you with your arms around each other, because Matt thinks Jimmy needs to accept Matt for where he is at.    Party on guys you are funn to  watch.    Chase Ingersoll    Please print a copy of this and give it to the three guys that are not on the blog.  Then the two of you stay out of each others way for 24 hours.  I'm hoping that both of you learn how to handle this situation ASAP, as I guarantee that it a fortnight it will be an issue for a couple of the gals on Glendale.   WHen that happens, I am going to send you and Matt over to handle it.   Matt can sit on your knee and you can put your arms around each other, and teach the gals, how to deal with their PSTD transference issues.

      The difficulty with addicts is that there are multiple issues wrapped up in the addiction and post active addiction behavior.   Just because someone is having all of the issues, does not mean that they are going to use, it is just evidence of all the areas in their life that are unresolved.    Here is a list for Matt of factors that I have observed that are by no means unique to him:    1. Age:  in the early 20's we were all doing things that people in their 30's, 40's and 50's knew to be goofy;    2:  Blindness:  that is just a whole nother stresser and factor that is going to have a person reacting and behaving differently than we.........because their situation is different;    3.  Recovery:  I just really doubt that the prison recovery experience is as good as it could be.  Prison is not there to accomodate good recovery choices.  It is just consequences, that may sort of in a way FORCE recovery on people.  Matt has really only been out there in Recovery circles on a daily basis for a couple of months.  Allow him the time to do 90 and 90 and then evaluate;    4.  Prison:  I have had people come to stay with me, out of prison (AND THE MILITARY!) for a number of years.  I know my family was freaked by me when I got out of the Marine Corps.  There is just a restlessness and unease that a person carries once freed from the restrictiveness of an institution.  The human psyche can cope so well to the un-naturalness of such institutions, but then it takes the brain a while to re-wire itself and adjust to normalcy.  There is also the problem that within the insitution, military or prison, we spend so much time thinking about what it was like when we were back on the street and what it will be like again when we get out, and then we get out, and our expectations of how it will feel do not line up with reality.  So there is a post institutionalization depression.    5.  Marriage:  anyone ever been married at a young age?  Married to another addict?  Having one child and expecting another?  Spouse not actually living with you?  A real tough gig to say the least and in this case, expecially precarious.      If I thought about it, I could probably think of more particularities.      Challenge him on his behavior.  He will continue to go to meetings and deal with things, and I think that the one thing that we can say in regards to Matt and everyone committed to the program is that over the long run, we will see improvement.    Don't forget that those of you who have to put up with someone in the rough times.........your reward is the friendship, mutual respect and trust of some0ne upon whom you can rely on when times are tough for you.    I believe that Matt has the capacity to be that for you and others in the long run and that despite what he may do to pain us in the present, let's remember the "promises" that are received by those who stay in recovery.

      Matt needs in my opinion to grow up and become a man.&nbsp; One attribute of a man is a human being who has learned to be responsible and sensitive to others around him.&nbsp; Matt has not learned these life skills yet.&nbsp; The evidence that brings me to this conclusion is his behavior time and time again in this house.&nbsp; When he left and stayed gone until 1:30 pm the following day only substantiates my opinion.&nbsp; I personally do not want to live with anyone that I suspect is using drugs.&nbsp; I don’t have any solid evidence but his behavior and his lack of candor leads me to this possibility. This is the second time that incidences of this type have occurred.&nbsp; He did call and left a message early in the evening that he was going fishing but that is all he said and Chase told me that this was a lie.&nbsp; At the house meeting Sunday all members of the house brought this incident to him and his response was negative.  What next Matt?????&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;

      The Board has long discussed the issue of a house computer and porn. In the first Recovery House, the porn really got out of hand, especially when we had a heterosexually challenged member who persisted, despite our admonishments, to stop wasting all of the ink in the printer, downloading and printing out pictures of men.    It started out with pictures of WWF men, but like any addict the poor fellow spiralled into fully naked men doing nasty things to each other, and when we caught the fellow, naked with the door open, on top of his partially nude "sponsor" that was the last straw.    The last we heard, he was back in prison on a parole violation, which is really quite ironic, because considering the way prisons are, he will have an endless supply of drugs, as there is an endless supply of men who will compensate him gladly in exchange for his "release services".    Of course in having to "address" the issue at the house with him, he resorted to calling me a homophobe to which I responded that I would not accept that label coming from a sex addict.    But presumably our issue is this time around would be with those with an  oversupply of heterosexual libido.    I have proposed to the board the following methods of restraining the ever present, ever tempting pornography beast:    1.  we will install a block  2.  the computer will be located downstairs, near the front door for all to see  3.  the women's recovery house participants will have access to the first floor of the house  4.  if porn becomes a problem for someone, we will delete their logon password to the computer, for a period of time;  5.  we will have a lot of funny blogging commentary and in depth pyscoanalysis of anyone suspected of using the computer  to view porn    Shhhhhhwinnnggggg!

      Does Matt have an income? Could he perhaps get a cell phone, or pay for an additional line at the house?     Getting a second line would not necessarily set a precedent for everyone, due to his special needs.    Someone already having a cell and only 1 contract can get an additional line that he could pay for, usually requiring a deposit to activate the second line. I have 2 lines on my service, but they are both being used right now.

      Is it possible to have the meeting minutes posted on the blog? I would like to be able to make the meetings, but I often have my kids during that time, and the problem at times of transportation. If the minutes were posted, that would be a great help to me.

      Yesterday the house members assembled to discuss house activity and resolve issues. The group agreed on house cleanup, notification of absence behavior and other general issues.  The group felt that a 5pm meeting would be best allowing residents to attend the 6pm AA meeting. Hopefully next Sundays meeting at 5pm will result with continued positive solutions for issues that occur in the Men’s Recover House.

      The basis of the rule was:    1. to get guys accustomed to sharing a phone;  2.  not have anyone running off with the phone to call 900 numbers;  3.  being able to find the phone - not having it locked in someones room.    The problem here is that we someone who is married and a parent, and I for one would rather they not expose the entire house to the dramatic moments of their relationship with their wife and children.  The house will always have more than enough drama.  We are also dealing with someone with a physical disability who is simply going to need more use of a telephone and contact with others via that telephone if he is going to develop the ties that normally bind us to the community.    Certainly something here can be negotiated so that we don't "clog  our blog"  by having a recurrence of this issue?    Obviously many guys are going to go cellular, but the house phone is s necessary tool for the house and especially for guys coming into the house, until they stabilize financially and find themselves in need of a cellphone.    Certainly something here can be negotiated so that we don't "clog  our blog"  by having a recurrence of this issue?       Chase Ingersoll

      Tonight my wife called me, and we started talking about how we missed each other. With that came her telling me about my son going from room to room calling for his daddy. When I heard this it brought me to tears immediately. Then my wife started crying. my first reaction was to leave the area, and with that I brought the phone to my room while my wife and I talked. A few moments later I heard a knock on the door. I answered, and Jim informed me that there were to be no phones in the room. I admit that I got a little heated because of the reason that I was in there, but I knew that he had no idea what was going on so I complied with his request, and came out to the stairs. So what's the problem?  &nbsp;  Here's&nbsp;my issue with the phone: First and fore&nbsp;most, when there is a situation with the phone where emotions are running wild because there is a situation with a spouse, or family member, I think that we should have a little privacy. I understand that&nbsp;there is to be&nbsp;no ananimity through out this house, but at the same time, I think that family issues&nbsp;outside of this house should be shared at the discretion of the resident.  &nbsp;  How was I able to bring the phone in my room? I boughtht with my own money, a cord to make the phone a little bit more easier to get to because of my visual impairment. The reason is because when the phone rings, I sometimes have difficulty getting to it before the voice mail picks up. Yes, the caller may leave a message, but on several occasions, i have had people tell me that they have left me a message, and asked why I have not returned the call. Obviously, it was because I did not recieve the message. To attempt to keep this from happening, I have told jim that I sometimes had a hard time getting to the phone before the voice mail picked it up. He advised me that he would adjust the amount of rings, but that was a couple of weeks ago, and nothing has been done. Naturally I didn't want to accuse Jim of not giving me the messages so I kept that to my self. Then here lately, I have&nbsp;been told that i was left messages by a couple of different people including my wife, and I have not been told about them. I reckonise that the proper thing to do about this situation is to bring it up at the house meeting, which I did today. Jim said something along the lines of Chase was putting a phone in and Jim was dropping his personal line. I also brought up the issue of the answering machine made available to all of the residents, and again that was pushed off on Chase's ordeal with the new line. So I got an answer on this issue, but I feel like we all got spun.  &nbsp;  My main issue, and the sole reason for writing this up is because when Jim returned from where ever, I informed him of the reason for me conversating with my wife in the privacy of my room. He replied " there are to be no phones in the room and you know that". After expressing the need for privacy, and adding a few more personal details he showed no comprimise and I honestly admit that I was getting more angry at his lack of understanding. I told him that me using the phone for the reason that I did tonight in my room I had no problem with someone using the privacy&nbsp; of there room so to keep themselves from showing that level of humility especially when there were guest that were not residing in this house, which there were 2 at that moment in time. I said that I would not honor that rule in that much of an emotional situation. He responded by saying that he would disconnect the phone, and I could take that up with the other residents.&nbsp; I took this like this was a threat of punishment like I was a teenager again. He followed up by saying that phones were not allowed in the room, and I asked if that was true, why does he. His reply was that he was the&nbsp; board member. and that was the way that it was. "Life sucks". He also remarked about me buying the extra long cord, and not taking it up with him before I bought it. I am sorry, but I didn't know that I was to inform him and ask his permission to buy something for the house that everyone uses and is quite thankful that I bought that item. Again I got more angry about him then walking off and mouthing "acceptance, acceptance". By him doing, and mocking this little childish phrase, I admit that he pulled my chain. Thank God for this program, and what it has taught me because at that moment with my emotions running like they were, it was extremely difficult to control my temper. 2 months ago, I would have been in jail right now. Now would&nbsp;have reacting in that mannor be rational, no. I am&nbsp;truly grateful for&nbsp;the change in my life that&nbsp;I&nbsp;owe to A.A.&nbsp;2 nonths ago, rational, or irrational behavior would have never crossed my mind.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  I hope that was not taken as a threat, that was not how I intended to put it out there. The problem is not so much the phone, but Jims obvious power struggle. I feel like Jim is taking it upon himself to be the daddy of the house, or at least with me.The way he put it was because he says. If he discussed this situation with the board on how he handle this situation with the board, and this was what was suggested, I find myself wondering what kind of farce is this becoming? There is nothing in the rules thatt I have that says anything about the phone. I think that in some circumstances a little bit of compassion is not to much to askk. I have never attempted to bring the phone to my room for any other reason. At no time have I refused anyone the phone while I was using it. When they commented that they needed it, I got off of it promptly. There is&nbsp;not an issue of&nbsp;respect because we all have been respectful&nbsp;when it comes to the phone. Well almost all of us, Jim seems to have some issue that he may need to take up with his sponser.  &nbsp; Asn&nbsp;for the rule with no phones in the room,&nbsp;Jim installed one in my room when I first got here. When I changed rooms, then the phone became an issue along with the DSL. I understand the new found rule and support it all the way so that no one is hogging the phone, but at the same time some compremise should be made in situations like this. The greater issue at hand is Jims approach to this issue. From my understanding, Jims duty here is to observe.. Not to act the way that he did. His action could set someone up to react in an unhealthy manor, not only bring chaos to that persons life, but to everyone in the house. &nbsp; I am asking that the board review this issue and together make some what of a comprimising decision. I am also asking DougK. to discuss rational, and irrational reactions with his sponsee.

      By the end of next week we hope to have a Recovery House up and running for women.  The program is the same, just a seperate location.  It has been more than a year since we first identified the location as a possible site for women, but it has taken a year to get things together.      Credit must be given to Jim Georgias, who has been steadfastly distributing applications and keeping the volume of the aide in his big hairy ears, turned up for conversations of women in need.   The house is not as large as the house at 1016, so we are going to avail the common areas of 1016 to the women 24/7.  That includes the downstairs, kitchen bath and laundry.  For the most part, men in the program will be discouraged from hanging out at the women's house, but women will be encouraged to come over and enjoy the men's space.        Call me sexist, but I think women are entitled to a bit more privacy and security than men, and I do not want any man to even be accused of lurking around the gals' pad.   It is just a prudent thing for the men to pretty much stay away, and for the women to stay off of the second floor of 1016 where the men have bedrooms.  Accordingly, the first floor bath will be designated as a guest bathroom.  Obviously we are not going to tell any woman that she cannot use the second floor bath, but then we are not going to expect the guys to keep it up to the same standard.  So start getting used to treating the downstairs like it is the womens, and try not to mess it up.    The other essential ingredient in all of this has been to identify the first gorup of women to go in the house.  More so than the men, I am concerned about the dynamics between the women and that we start the place with ones who can get along and establish a house "culture" that is supportive of women who have been struggling through recovery while lacking any real recovery support in their home life.   Truthfully, much of the support will come from 1016, but these women especially need to experience that support first within their own home and with women, and secondarily from men who will treat them as sisters, rather than as 13th step targets, with bullseyes on their bottoms.    Like the men, the woman can know that they will be blogged and that now expectation of privacy is expressed or implied, and is in fact explicitly denied.  Trust me, this will become an issue as Girltalk on Glendale will trickle over to Madison's Men and hurt feelings will arise.      Okay - that is enough for now, I'm having an Odie moment here, thinking about how much fun this is going to be to just sit here and watch.    Welcome aboard ladies.......    Chase Ingersoll

      Guys, you are going to hear a lot of negative reactions to Recovery House.   I have yet to hear a negative reaction from someone who actually knows something about it, and who has more than a week since their last relapse.    If you get a negative statement, respond by encouraging the person to tell you everything they have heard and/or know.    Then ask them how the stuff written on the blog has affected their view.   They will most likely be totally unaware of the blog, so give the web address to them and advise them that it is an essential way that the board and participants communicate so as to keep each other and anyone interested in what is actually going on at the House.       The next question to ask them is what they know what are the three things that will cause the board to instantly remove someone from the house.  They will not, so provide them with the answer:  1.  Relapse;   2.  Lack of financial responsibility;  3.  Any criminal activity.      Then ask them if they are aware of our success rate.  They will answer no.  Advise them that our success rate is 100%.  They will be surprised, and you can elaborate that we guage our success rate, not on something we cannot control as in whether or not someone will relapse, but rather we gauge our success rate on the following criterion:  1.  Have we rewarded the participant for good behavior, by which we mean, have we provided the participant with a safe and affordable clean and sober living environment that supports the recovery of those who have taken a positive step toward recovery;  and 2.  Have we held participants who have relapsed, accountable, by immeidately removing them from the premises.   To that we can all say that the program has a 100% success rate.       I find it amusing that treatment centers try and guage their "success rate" by relapse statistics, when really there is no way to tangibly measure whether or not someone has relapsed, turned to some other addiction, or is simply sober but misserable and dependent on medication.  Obviously treatment centers are attempting to take credit for success, when any addict will tell you that the treatment center was ultimately just the knowledge, but that having the knowledge, had absolutely nothing to do with whether or not the person became motivated to use the knowledge and change.       I think possibly, treatment just plain sucks to so many people, and is such a negative consequence, that it motivates people to not come back.   You can have barely any knowledge and never relapse.  But regardless of how much knowledge you have, you will relapse if you are not properly motivated on a daily basis.    I would also think that just about any addict would agree that it was the people that they met and with whom they had relationships after treatment had a greater effect than the treatment as to if they stayed clean and sober.

      Thank you, Jim for your input. I, too , wrestle with many irrational  ideas, causing me to consistently feel like a failure. When I don't  meet these unrealistic expectations, I have a lifetime of  self-preservation maneuvers to draw from.       My program teaches me that today, I must look at my role, honestly, and  try to evaluate as best I can, with the help of others, the solution.  The solution for me today is to look at me, what I can do differently,  admit when I am wrong or unrealistic, operating in character defects.       Thankfully, I can acknowledge this much fater, what's it been,  3  days?, rather than having to use these self defeating actions as a  foundation because I am too full of false pride to admit my error.       I would like to sincerely apologize for dragging what started as a one  on one battle of wills to this forum. It was very unnecessary to behave  as adolescents on what is supposed to be a positive format.       I am learning, as I go, that I need to constantly focus on not only me,  but the solution instead of the problem. I hope noone was drawn into  this as seeing it as what recovery is about, because it truly is not.  Defending our positions may have worked well in court for us, but, in  life in recovery, not so effective.

      A.Irrational: If a job is worth doing it must be done right.   B. Rational: If a job is worth doing its worth doing the best I can at that time.  &nbsp;  This irrational belief has been my philosophy for many years and has placed a lot of pressure on me as a human being I thought that I had to do a job well to be accepted and to live up to my self imposed standards. When I didn’t meet these self imposed standards I became very angry with my self. I felt stupid and frustrated when things didn't go as I expected they would. I even propagated this irrational belief to my students as a workable job ethic. I couldn’t tolerate mistakes or criticism constructive or not&nbsp; Several times in my working carrier I quit a job because of my frustration with myself for not performing up to my expectations.&nbsp; I couldn’t except my&nbsp; mistakes and made excuses which further complicating my life. I felt I should be thoroughly competent, intelligent, and achieving in all possible respects. When I had trouble performing I retaliated with anger at my self and others and this defeated my confidence in my self and deflated my self esteem  &nbsp;  Today I&nbsp; must work on doing the best I can at the time. I think I always tried to do things perfect, but I put unnecessary pressure on my self-doing so. I can't do it right all the time due to factors, which may be out of my control.&nbsp; I can't control the behavior or actions of others nor do I have the right too. I can't fix everything all the time and I must develop a belief that is more rational. With this more rational belief I can make mistakes and accept failure.&nbsp; I have to realize that I am a fallible human being going through life trying to get better&nbsp; I must not place undo pressure on my self to perform with perfection. I should try and do the best I can on the job and accept myself as a quite imperfect creature, who has general human limitations and specific fallibilities. Developing this more rational belief will make it possible to pursue other skills that were not available to me because of my irrational belief that anything I do must be done well.  &nbsp;  .&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;

      Sorry to have to get out the 2x4.  Matt knows how it  feels.    But at a certain point I get tired of stuff  that I see in the way of not just your success, but in you having more  people around you and your leading them to higher levels of sobriety.      One commonality with addicts is that they all have so much incredible  potential, but are so often distracted by pointless things, or they  come up with excuses not to do the things that are going to pay off  incredibly in the long run.      One of the biggest problems that I see in the program is that the long  timers move on, and they are not willing to take on the job of engaing  the the more recent people and constantly challenging them, to the  point of making the more recent people uncomfortable, if that is what  it takes to get them to improve faster and to greater levels.      It is like the Army.  Going into boot camp, you really have no  concept of what you can achieve, much less how to actually do it, or  the discipline when shown how, to actually do it every day until those  things become second nature.      Sobriety is a mariaculous gift, but if we are to appreciate it to its  fullest, we have to use that gift to its fullest, rather than just  limping along in life, content that we are no longer sick and tired.      People get to choose the direction that they will go.  My method,  is that when I see a person who has chosen the right path, is to lean  on them and push them to get where they are going faster and to get  much further down the road than they might have thought possible, if  for no other reason than, the further they get down that road and deal  with their issues, the further they are from ever going back, and the  more they will be able ot help others.

      .............. Recovery is not having everything organized and  having your life so strait jacketed that you cannot put aside what you are  doing and reprioritize your schedule so that whatever task does the most people  the greatest good is the one that you drop everything to do. Recovery is about  being able to react to those daily surprises and adapt your resorces to help  the most, regardless of all the addicts around you who scream WHAT ABOUT ME!  WHAT ABOUT ME! YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING TO WARM MY MILK!!! LET THAT GUY STAND  OUT IN THE COLD FOR ANOTHER HOUR. YOU SAID YOU WOULD WARM MY MILK. I WANT WARM  MILK NOW!!!!-----excerpt from TGIF.      This was what happened when other jobs had to be taken on to make ends  meet, since the paymaster was calling the shots. And, this was exactly  your reaction, the warm milk, that is. Funny how we can't see when we  are describing our own behaviors while looking at others. They say that  the behaviors we are most intolerant of are the ones we, ourselves own.  Interesting.........

      Thank God I understand...............I need to look at MY actions and  behaviors, not be so busy seeing everyone else's that I don't realize I  may have a fault or 2.  I can admit my faults, when they are my  faults. You can rationalize your excuses all you want, by the way, why  is it when someone else may have a priority, you don't see it that way?  Maybe because Everyone else isn't as self centered as you may deny  being.       I am finished lobbing rationalizations across the net to you, I know my  program tells me I need to look at me, so I will be doing that now.  Sounds like good advice, no?

       I am very glad that you chose to offer the following facts as a rebuttal:      .....but I know where there's a basement floor not ready, a bathroom floor not ready, a recovery house not finished, a personal home not finished........      Lets start with the basement floor,  my intent was to get to that yesterday, but to do so, I would have had to have broken a promise to my wife to be home in time for dinner.  It would have been nice to finish today,  but there was there was an hours worth of paperwork that popped up for Recovery House, that I am previously obligated to several people to do.  I am also previously obligated to spend a couple hours every Friday morning working on my wife's house.  So there went the morning.  My wife also had a class to teach, so I was left with my son, so I took him on some general errand running for my wife.  Upon returning from that, I had a trip to the hardware store, some paperwork to do for the Neighborhhood Association, and then I had to meet a material supplier at a property in order to put together a bid to repair concrete.  But before I got there, I had to stop at the bookstore and get a 12 Step book, to follow up on a 12th Step call that I made Monday.   Because my wife wanted time this evening, I was not going to be able to pick the guy up for a meeting tonight, so did an hour round trip at 3:30 to make certain that he had some materials as this is his first week trying to get clean and sober.   When I got back to town, I stopped by the concrete project to see where we were at, but no one was there, so I went down to Recovery House to discuss with the board member in residence a couple of situations including the news guy that is there.  From there I headed home, because I have a pile of paperwork and mail on the desk and my wife wants to have dinner by 5:00 p.m. and then wants to go down by the river with our boy.  Oh yes, there were a couple of other errands regarding properties and tools in all of this.      As for the Recovery House and my house not being finished.   According to the logic that I think you are presenting, the proper thing for me to do, would have been to finish my house, before getting into working on the recovery house.   The answer to that, I'll leave to Matt and Jim.  Where would you guys be staying, if someone had not invested countless hours over the last two months, doing everything from cleanup in the basement, new water lines, replacing toilet drains, installing ventilation in the third floor when it was 120 degrees, supplying a television, cable, utilites, etc........?    I'll let you guys answer that.    But lets go back a year.  Because as much work as 1016 has been 905 was a lot more.  Why all of the time and money that was spent on that place, I could have redone my wife's house three times over, and I could just retire and sit in front of a big screen television and computer all day long and say to heck with the rest of the world.    No.  Recovery is not having everything organized and having your life so strait jacketed that you cannot put aside what you are doing and reprioritize your schedule so that whatever task does the most people the greatest good is the one that you drop everything to do.  Recovery is about being able to react to those daily surprises and adapt your resorces to help the most, regardless of all the addicts around you who scream WHAT ABOUT ME!  WHAT ABOUT ME!  YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING TO WARM MY MILK!!!  LET THAT GUY STAND OUT IN THE COLD FOR ANOTHER HOUR.  YOU SAID YOU WOULD WARM MY MILK.  I WANT WARM MILK NOW!!!!    There is a difference between what an addict may want, which is for the healthier person to come in and bail them out and do something for them, that the addict should have done for themselves a long time ago.   But what the addict will do is turn it around on the person who has no obligation to help them and critique the help as not being enough, not at the right time, or whatever, and then looking for other things to critique about the person who was to help them.  That is part of the addicts thinking. It is an  age  old and all too common behavior.  I saw it 12 years ago when I volunteered at a homeless shelter, and found it to be amazing how homeless people would treat you, a volunteer, like you were their slave whenever you were giving attention to someone else other than them.  Envy?  Jealousy?  Anger as a result of self centeredness?  A bit of all of the above.   It's not as shocking to me as it was then.   But it is indicative of what level a person is functioning on and how relevent their recovery program is, as reflected in their attitude and subltlely expressed resentments.    As for the concrete and another couple of projects that I did not get to today.  That's what Saturday Morning is for.    TGIF    Chase Ingersoll

      Much of what you say is true.  Having  achieved long term recovery, you have had much more time and trial to work on these things.  Most people aren't going to be receptive to some of the expectations you place on them. Often times, people find themselves doing the best they can given the current situation, only to feel that it is their fault that the plans given them just don't work.     I believe what we have to remember is that what works for me, might get someone else high. We have to let people acquire their recovery as THEY get it, not as I give it. Someone not meeting our expectations does not necessarily mean they are "not ready". Some of us have a lifetime of issues and self defeat to work through, other than a sad story about our families. Some have been neglected, abused, beaten, any number of things.     Recovery cannot be force-fed, nor can one produce consequences when expectations arent met. That is God's job, not ours. We are not supposed to choose who and why we want to help, we are just supposed to help. That might mean me realizing that the plan I have asked someone to follow didn't work, and I need to accept responsibility for that, not tell others how much of a slacker they are.     Me, I think about quitting smoking a lot. I'm just not there yet.  I will get there, though.      It's also possible that some try to do more than they are capable of doing. Passive - Agressively, as addicts, we typically commit to everything and get little done. Not to point fingers, but I know where there's a basement floor not ready, a bathroom floor not ready, a recovery house not finished, a personal home not finished........, wait I suddenly thought of another typical addict behavior; starting much and finishing little. I believe the Big Book talks about us wanting the world to judge us based on our intentions, not our actions, or something like that.      Truly, I have many defects and unhealthy behaviors. You should have seen them about 3 years ago. I am working on them, at least trying to own my own shit, which some refuse to even admit they have.     Grudgingly, Slowly  becoming agreeable.

      You are looking at what you are doing and perhaps contrasting to the past.    I am looking at the possibilities and contrasting it to the ideal.       Being a smoker, absolutely undermines the moral authority that you have with kids and they will get to an age that if they do not throw that in your face, they will at least be thinking it.    Pornography:  your definition of porn and mine are two different things.  I am trying to get to a point in my life, where my sensitivity is that of my wife's, because she is much healthier and appropriate in that area than I am ........my wife will not allow even a underwear catalog in the house, much less a men's magazine like MAXUM.    It may be a loving atmosphere, but it is physically unhealthy and sends a mixed message.    Don't feel bad - my father was the same way.  He said that same thing that you are, and compared to our abusive mother, his messed up pit was better than being around her.  But now he is in recovery and is apologizing to his kids, for not getting that stuff out of his life sooner and having set a better example for them.    Online poker - there are people in the world who need help, there are motivational books that need to be read, there is a front porch to be cleaned up.  If a person had a father, he would come in and say, stop playing games until you have cleaned up your room.      It is just evidence that the person did not have appropriate structure and guidance as a child and is stuck in an adolescent lifestyle.    It is a step up from using, but it is not capitalizing on recovery and it does not allow him to challenge other people to go beyond the level and lifestyle that Bruce has achieved.    It is not okay with you if you do not attract a health concious woman.  THat is something that God wants all of his men to have, but God also wants His women and His Kids to have health concious guys who can provide for them.  And God allows us to face the consequences of the sort of dysfunctional people and relationships that we get into, if we are not constantly challengiung ourselves and others to improve.    ...MY life happens....That is an old attitude.      New attitude:  my life is going to happen and I am going to put in maximum effort to be an example and blessing to everyone in my life.  I am going to shed all bad habits and unhealthy characteristics by working on them daily and getting help when available so that I can be the most positive role model that I can be.    My wife and child get more time than most.  But they get that because I invested in hard work for many years, before I even knew them.  I began working on these issues many years ago before I knew them.    Interesting: while I was still engaged to another woman, there was this good recovery friend who was totally in love with the woman who is now my wife.  I told him point blank that it was just not going ot happen unless he quit smoking.  He tried anyway, but didn't even get to first base.  He thought he loved her, but he was not willing to give up a negative behavior in order to be able to spend more time with her.   THat was probably not the only potential relationship that he lost out on because he would not work on that addiction.    There were also some other addictive behaviors that were not so visible that he was not working on, and I have not seen him for more than 7 years.    IF you love your kids, you will not only want them to not have to go through the worst things that you went through, but you will also want them to look back and look at you as the prime example and motivator of everything that is good and healthy.      You cannot risk lung cancer 15 years from now and having to watch your little ones smoke cigarettes or anything else.   The socially acceptable (in some circles) behaviors of being around people who are smoking, drinking, gambling or oversexualizing, are the gateways to the harder drugs and more addictive forms of these behaviors.      A great guy is also a great guy for his wife and kids.  That's part of the definition.  THere is a balance of priorities in being there both in the family sense and in the professioanl and recovery sense.  There is a constance battle between my wife and time for 12 step calls which continually throw my schedule out of whack.  But she knows that the depth to which I can emotionally be there for her, was as a direct result of skills I developed in AA and helping other people and that she cannot isolate me in her world.    I don't expect you to agree with me in the next ten minutes.  The pattern I have observed is that you have to think about thinks for a day, sleep on it.  And that you will probably agree with me tomorrow.  Like the saying he who laughs last, laughs best, he who is right in the long run is the most right.  The point is that as a person in recovery it is always a good thing to practice delayed gratification, and having practiced that for many years, I am ready to wait a lot longer than tomorrow for you to agree with me.    Take as long as you like to agree with me.   Unitl you do, I will just allow myself to be amused by your contradictions.    HAHAHAHAHAHA  (evil laugh)    Chase Ingersoll

      Craig and I originally began Recovery House by looking into the Oxford House International Organization.   My wife was tired of my bringing situations home and as we were having a child, she would not tolerate smokers in the house.  Craig and I looked at Oxford to provide the structure and model for us.  I made contact with the Oxford Chapter in Springfield and obtained an application from the Oxford National in New York.  The problem that we had with Oxford, is that it did not accomodate the type of population that we were attempting to serve, which was guys who were coming out of White Oaks.  In the Oxford Model, the board excercises very little control, the support is at a different level, and the residents in the house are supposed to manage the house rules, financial aspects, discipline, fines and removal of people from the premises.  What we observed is that people in the first year of recovery, are ill equipped to perform such functions.  It is basically all that they can do, to make it to meetings, work full time and try and deal with all of the other loose ends in their lives.   Now after more than a year of this, I would say that even someone a year into recovery who has dealt with numerous loose ends, is still easily overwhelmed by the circumstances of people who are new in recovery.    I think that the turning point is around several years.  After several years of active recovery and assisting people, you build up appropriate boundaries and defenses against the irrational behaviors of the addict.  Sure, people can still piss you off, but after four or five years, your patterns and habits of dealing with those situations and your support network of people to call on to assist you is so intertwined into your daily life, that one or two goofballs acting out is more of an empty styrophome cup than even a speedbump in your roadway to recovery.    Other specifics about the Oxford model is that the guys in the house, elected officers.  The officers were to run the meeting, collect funds, pay bills and meet out fines.  Ha!   Could you imagine the five of you doing that with each other?  I don't think any of you are taking this as any insult.  It should be clear by now how you felt about Greg's situation and how I felt.  I laughed, and went back to the rules that were thought out long ago, before Greg ever arrived on the scene and immediately analyzed and made the decision.  No lost sleep.  No worries.  Just bing bang boom, this is how this goes.  Stay clean and sober, and you will get there.    Actually it is even worse.  I met with Greg this morning and I laughed at him.  He did not know how to take that.  But let this be a warning for any of you who will find yourselves in the same or similar situation.  I will laugh at your hurt feelings.  Just because you feel bad......is no reason that I should feel bad.  While you were getting high.  I was being responsible, so therefore I should be rewarded with laughter and you should be rewarded your tears.  But there is another reason that I laugh.  Time and time again I have observed the post-relapse addict to be like the quiet after the storm, and so much easier to deal with.  Funny how all it takes is a few hours of binging to make the addict understand what you had spent several weeks trying to explain to him.  So I am now happy that the relapser now seems to understand.  Understanding is a good thing.  Also know, that after a relapse, I will and believe that we all should, be harder on a person, rather than easier.  Easy does it, but easy does not work a program.  By harder, I mean that we should set the bar higher and let the person know that we expect them to be more honest, more discipline, more charitable and more humble, etc....than they were before they relapsed.  They can't argue with you, because it is obvious that whatever level of those characteristics they were at before - were not good enough to keep them clean and sober.  Getting back to Oxford, and the differences with Recovery House, we believe that having a board member in Residence and having the Board living outside the House handle financial and disciplinary issues, allows the guys in the house to focus on their own responsibilities and work more on helping and supporting each other with their recovery issues, rather than having to actually be in authority over each other or be ultimately responsible for each other.     I think this allows you to be each others friends, rather than mentors, and this is good, because I want you to be modeling your recovery after people who are actually fulfilling their potential, rather than people that are still discovery it.    To flush that out in your life, if you want to be a baseball pitcher, are you going to model your pitching style after the other guy on your little league team, or are you going to go right to the top and model yourself after Nolan Ryan or some other major league pitcher with whom you have a similar build or personality?   Likewise in other areas of life.  You don't want to model your humility after someone who is humble but has not achieved much to be proud over, but rather find a model who has achieved much but is still humble.  Frequently for the addict, his life is so much better with just a little success at sobriety, that very appropriate goals and achievement are set aside.  Examples of this is the guy who is sober for a couple of years, but is still wasting his money and time, smoking, gambling and trying on different women.  In essense the guys is squandering the recovery tools he has learned and earned in his fight against drinking, by laying those tools down and letting other fruitless behaviors walk all over him.  Ultimately, you will be able to tell which addict has applied recovery to all areas of his life and the addict who has not the following way.  The addict who trully has been applying recovery principles to all areas of his life - you will not be able to tell that the person was ever an addict. In that case, the person is going to have to tell you.  When you come across that kind of person.  Stick close and follow them.  Chase Ingersoll

      From the moment that we found out, we began to feel it. The fear of our personal property being stolen, to the panic of our own possible relapse. Greg told Mark that he told chase, but when I found out that was not the case, a huge weight was lifted off of my chest. Immediately, I began to think that Chase was going to let Greg stay here. Don't get me wrong, I like Greg, and would do all that I can to help him, and have for the past week and a half. At the same time, all that I could think about was that all that i needed was an unguarded moment, and I was back in full effect. I know that I wont stop untill I end up back in the joint. That is how I was sentenced to six years as a blind man. When I was told that there was a possibility that he may stay even after every one knew what took place, my fear came back even worse than the first time. Why? I know me. There was a time when nothing, or anyone could stand in front of me getting high. My first long term sentence was for 96 counts of burglary, and theft. Luckily, I was a juvenile and did a year in J.I.D.O.C. Even after I blew my eyes out of my head, and ruind a cornea transplant, I continued to activly use. I chased that drug all the way to the joint, and 1 hit is all that I need, and I will do it again.  I am fearful of that unguarded moment so I do every thing that I can no matter the sacrifice, especially now. I call my sponser so much that i am sure that when he sees our number on his phone, he shouts, but he always answers it.   Another thing was that Greg, and I got along pretty well. At the time that he took off, he did not call his sponser. He did not even attempt to talk to me. I feel like that he did not even try.   My point is: Maybe relapse is an important part of recovery, but this not his first time around. He knew what he should have done, and blatenly ignored the suggestions that have proven to work.   For the Peoria Recovery House to maintain it's level of respect, and dignity, the board must enforce the rules with out a second thought. I know that I would expect the same treatment. I know that my opinion does not matter much, but I support Chases, and robs dicision. I know that making that decision was difficult because I find it extremely hard to support it, but they are right about needing to suffer the natural concequenses. It is not only the relapser that is suffering, but the other residents as well. If nothing else it has been a learning experience. Mark, and I were talking to ourselves last night, and we both agreed that  we were glad that we didn't have to go through that.  I am thankful that this example has been set. Looking at the entire situation shows me even more that I don't ever want to return to that way of life.  Thank you to the board for following through with enforcing these ever valuable rules.  P.S. I appreciate the previouse comments about my change in my attitude, and recovery. I must be completely honest. When I first logged on to this site, I was furious. I am not sure how every one else feels, but I feel like I am doing very well, and I owe it all to Chase, and now that I think on it a little bit further,Rob. All I wanted to do was prove the both of them wrong. Now a change came over me that is nearly impossible to explain. I appriciate the fact that Chase stayed in my ass. I hated him at first, now I think that the world of him.   Rob, I am not apoligizing for the things that i said because if I did, I wouldn't mean it, but I am asking if we can start over?  Chase,   I just got off of the phone with a girl named Lisa. She is getting ready to go to in patient at New Leaf. She is intrested in the Womens Recovery House. I told her that she should come over, and fill out an application. She is currently on Social security, so rent is not an issue. Looking for further instructions to give her.

      It sucks when someone relapses. I have to agree with Chase, though, based on my personal experience in these situations. If guys were let right back in, they didn't recieve the natural consequences of their actions, just like all the times someone enabled us all in the past, perpetuating our own addictions. I remember one instance in particular, the guy seemed really remorseful, we let him back in, he stole our stuff. The guys who had to stay at the mission for a minute were usually pretty grateful for what they had before they relapsed.   As for Beewolf, I have been there several times, and met some good people. For me, it's just not what I need. Not to say it isn't a good place, I'm sure it is for some, but not for me. I have seen several of my friends drift from the fellowship they were attending, start going to Beewolf, and relapse. Not to say they did what they needed to there, but it makes me curious. I have also had friends that found a sponsor, or, a sponsor "found them" there, only to discover that the sponsor had very little time for them. These are merely my observations, right or wrong, I'm not trying to belittle anyone or anything. In a nutshell, I guess I am suggesting that guys (or girls) spread themselves out and try different meetings and fellowships. The more people in one's life, the more accountability there can be.   Just Observations and suggestions, please don't be offended or retaliatory. It's not always necessary to know someone or something intimately to see patterns or red flags. We are addicts and alcoholics, sharing the common bond of adddiction, which has its own behavior patterns and idiosyncracies that are easily identified regardless of level of relationship.

      Anyone who is serious about recovery is compasionate.   Anyone who has ever relapsed can be understanding. It is a good thing that Jim and Mark are compassionate and understanding.  But there is a thing that is higher than compassion and understanding, and that is responsibility and holding people accountable.    In order for someone to stay clean and sober, they must absolutely learn comapssion and understanding. That is they must learn to be compassionate and understanding of how others will feel when they relapse.  Obviously this person is still focused on how "...he feels..." and it was never more appropriate for me to say last Thursday that I don't give a damn how they feel and that what I care about is how they think and what they do.  Life is not going to improve for us if we think and behave according ot how we feel.  If we learn to think correctly and do right life will improve.  It is on one level compassionate to allow the relapser to stay. BUt that is a low enough level of compassion to possibly co-mingle itself with enabling. A higher level of compassion is to allow the person to experience the consequences of thinking and acting according to their feelings, feelings which we know to be irrational. The consequences of going to the Peoria Rescue Mission are as most of you could descibe: 1.  Rather than having your own room, you get to share a room with 80 other homeless men in all states of insanity and dysfunction; 2.  Rather than getting to go to a meeting, you are required to go to chapel; 3.  You will not select your menu - you will eat what is set before you; 4.  I doubt that there is a 30 inch television with Dish Network and a DVD player. 5.  There is a 5:00 am wakeup call.  Also, it is not appropriate for one guy in the house to be directly financially providing or loaning to another.  This changes the dynamic of the relationships.  How can the borrower hold the lender or giver accountable, without risking the loss of the favor?    It is good to be in a possition to help people, but that is precisely when we must be more responsible and think longer and harder about the sort of help that we give them.    The Rules of Recovery House are in black and white on the application.  Relapsers must remove themselves.  If we were to fail to remove this person, we will undermine our ability to hold anyone in the program accountable for not only this rule, but for any rule.  This is not a decision for the Board - the Board made this decision a long time ago.  Now it is just a matter of sticking to the agreement that we make to each and every participant, the community and ourselves.  The person must go.    You are welcome to be compassionate and undertanding of the relapser, and may see him, and spend time with him throughout the week.  But the relapser is not allowed in the house.  If the relapser checks in throughout the week, or is available for a board member to do a face to face each day,  the relapser may re-apply on Friday.  If at that time they wish to return and are ready to be responsible, they may be readmitted.  I would suggested that you get Rob's first hand observation of two guys that relapsed at the first recovery house.  They both were taken to detox and from there were deposited at the Rescue Mission.  One continued to drink while at the mission, while the other went back to work and was restored to the house after a week.  There was never any problem with him.  Keep in mind that the person who returns from the Rescue Mission experience will not be the same person that relapsed.  They will be a new and improved edition.  And they will absolutely enforce the relapse rule on others, because they will from first hand experience know that the application of fair and just consequences is in fact the height of compassion, understanding and responsibility.

      Greg relapsed yesterday and spent all his money but he is still alive!.  I believe that relapse is a part of the recovery process for some people.  Now the Recover House Board must make a decision on Gregs future.  Mark has offered to support Greg with the rent and my support is in the form of compassion and understanding.  In my opinion Greg should be given another opportunity in Recovery house.  It would serve no useful purpose to discharge him but offering compassion and help is the right approach in this case.

      This is interesting, because I was informed that this person had a problem with money, but that can mean a lot of things.  My understanding was that the substance addiction had more to do with Alcohol than crack.  Clearly we are dealing with a severe crack addiction.  The policy is quite simple.  This is a Recovery House, not a Relapse House. Recovery House is not Beewolf where you can return to meetings still half drunk, and an hour after you have run out of money for crack.  A program participant who relapses must leave immediately.  If they wish to reapply for the Recovery House Program, they must go to the Peoria Rescue Mission for one week, let us know where they are at during the day, and check in daily with a Board member for a week, prior to being readmitted.   This was the long-standing policy from last year, and we saw it work.  If the person goes to the Rescue Mission, a board member can go down there after hours, to see the person.  Abviously when someone relapses it is a hard thing on those living in the House.  But what we found, is that it is a good thing for the addict to put on the shoes of the people  who were in their lives when the addict was still being irresponsible and relapsing.  Now the addict can feel what it is like to be worried about the relapser showing up.  The addict can worry about HIS stuff being stolen and sold for crack.  The addict can worry about the relapser getting violent.  The thing that I like about relapses is that what I may have been trying to get through to a person, and what they would not shut up and listen to, or accept, before they relapsed, after they relapse, they tend to have less to argue with what I had to say about their attitudes and their program.  We can run an easy program and try and keep people from relapsing, but often when we have pointed out something that someone needs to work on and they refuse to acknowledge that, it makes no sense for us to act as a crutch for that area of their life.  It is better to be hard on their foolishness and refuse to support that liability in their program, because the sooner that liability causes them to relapse, the sooner they can face the reality of it and accept the need and the actions required to change it.  I would also like to point out that this person, was the person who was most vocal about privacy and confidentiality.  Time and time again it has been proven to me that those who are focused on that, are focused on it because they have something to hide, and are concerned that when they do something embarrassingly inappropriate, their deeds will be made known to people.  Honest recovery requires TRANSPARENCY in all aspects of our lives.  Time and time again, I have seen the addict in early recovery exhibit a hypervigilance in regards to honesty.  Interestingly thought, the examples of those people that I can think of, were in a Recovery Mode and my impression is that they did not relapse.  For the record, I have been through precisely what you are experiencing, having someone living with you who has relapsed.  At least the relapser did not take YOUR vehicle 40 miles away to buy heroin, right after they had talked a lot of crap about you.  for the record, though, that person has been clean for a year now.  Another observation, would you say that compared to how I was on Matt, that I was easy on this person or hard on them?   I would suspect that you would say that I was easy.  Contrary to what many might think, the harder that I am (read bigger asshole that I am) to someone, the more likely they are going to deal with the problematic behavior.  It is easy for me to be nice.  It takes a lot more energy to defend your actions after you have been tough on someone, which is one reason that I do not like to go there.     But obviously with this person, tough is the only way out.  A final note, if you are in a meeting, or hear of people complaining about Recovery House, you should challenge that with the following fact: people who lived with or worked with Chase, who complained about Chase to other people, in and out of meetings - were on their way to relapsing, if someone did not challenge that person's attitude and that person did not accept that challenge and change their attitude.  Obviously this required people in meetings being tough on them and the person taking the right step from there.    Chase Ingersoll

      A Heart felt thanks to both Matts and Matt's friend (the one that donated the grill).  Let's move ahead with plans for a cookout - slash house warming party. This could be lots of fun.  That's what it's all about anyway - having fun and "trudging the road to happy destiny".  I heard through the grapevine that Mark has solved the sponsor issue by "hiring" a temporary sponsor.  The payment plan has yet to be revealed, but it may be an interesting one if I know Mark.  You know he has a special gift don't you? Ask him aboout it sometime - especially if you have about 25 minutes with nothing to do but listen to Mark ramble on and on.  I do hope he reads this with a smile on his face.   John has been advised by several people not to attend Beewolf. If I were him I would definately hit a bunch of meetings there just to see what goes on there if nothing else. Maybe instead he a pretty good group of recovering folks if he looks with an open mind.  Either way, we definately need to hit lots more meetings John. Here is an assignment for everone who sees or speaks to Jim Fagan. Lets all hit him up to get on the BLOG. I value his thoughts and I know others on here do as well.  If we all ask him to get on here, he may try it.  Ifanyone tried to send me an email directly, I was having trouble recieving for a minute - I was unable to get 10 messages. I believe I am back in good shape now though.    Keep in touch.

      My sponser, and I got the grill. It is pretty decent, it will serve the purpose anyway.   Greg set out to paint the kitchen last night, never got it finished. We haven't seen him all day. Any idea where he is? Mark, and I want to put the kitchen back together, yet do not want to cause a commotion.  Looking for feed back.  P.s. There were comments about not sure if he/ Mark had a sponser. I just wanted to let every one know that he is looking. He does not want to pick up just anyone.

      I never heard anything more about the cook out. Mark is hel bent on getting a grill, so I asked my sponser if he knew where one was. He has a frend that has two webbers that are just sitting. He believes that we could get one for free. There's one for the house. He is planning on picking it up either tomorrow, or Sunday. "Go MATT".

      Does this mean that I can have one? A fish I mean. I was not involved in the decision to pull this prank at first, but when Greg asked me to post a comment about him getting a dog, I knew that a pet of this kind would not be allowed to happen. He does have a plan to get this little puppy, but it will be bought from Wal- Mart.   Yes, this puppy is stuffed, but not with my foot. He wanted me to post it, and I did. He wanted to have a little fun with the board, at the same time, an issue that was bound to arise, has been nipped before it ever came up. What what you do with out me?  Just so that you know, Greg is in the process of painting the kitchen. "GO GREG".

      I should have been prepared for this issue.  And it it one of the reasons that Matt and Jim will be putting together a three ring binder of all of these blogs, and the full content of the binder, will be required reading for any new participants.  I'm not certain how to gently walk through this discussion, but let us start it with some examples I have heard over the years in recovery.   I have heard sponsors suggest that after 6 moths you get a plant and see if you can keep it alive.  After a year of keeping a plant, then you get a pet.  After a year of keeping a pet alive, then you get a girl.   The principle is that first we learn to take care of ourselves.  Then we learn to take care of something living, yet inanimate.  Then we learn to take care of beasts.  And finally we get a crack at taking care of someone else.  The first question I would have to ask, is whether or not this puppy, was discussed with ones sponsor?  I'm doubting it.  And that is what makes this scenario a good learning example.  This is precisely the kind of think that one should use and I have seen people in recovery use their sponsor for.  That may sound silly to some, but I have seen it be very effective.  Additionally, this is also the sort of thing that should be discussed with the people that one is living with, prior to doing.    I once wanted a Rotweiller.  They are really fine beasts.  But I had to first discuss it with my roomate - in that case, it was my wife.  And she kept saying no.  This went on and on for some time, but then one day a stray beagle/mutt showed up on our back step.  I think my wife said yes, so that she did not have to hear any more requests for a Rotwieller.  But the important point of this, is that I had enough respect for the person that I was living with, that I did not bring another living thing, into the space that we shared, until she was agreeable to it.  So the problem that we have not at Recovery House, is that someone has gone about something the wrong way, andwe all are now in the following bind:   if we do not address the issue, we have established a precedence, whereby everyone would seem to have the right to bring just about any animal they wanted on the premises.  The most obvious slippery slope is that each fellow in the Recovery House decides that they want a dog and that they will keep it in their room.  At that point the second floor is not a Recovery House, it is a Kennel.    But on the other hand, if we address the issue, are we going to hurt the feelings of the perosn who got the dog.  Hopefully I made myself clear the other day....I cannot make someones feelings a priority, when I have to be the final arbiter or what is fair between multiple parties.  Feelings are irrational.  Responsibility, health and welfare and liability are rational factors, and it will be upon those factors, not feeling that this decision will be made.  The rational factors are as follows:  1.  When you have multiple people living on a premises, a dog is a group decision, and in this case, ultimately the decision of the board and owner of the property, because they will ultimately be liable for the dag;  2.  THe #1 factor the board is going to consider in this case is liability.  And the number one fact I have to communicate is that I have a good friend who is an independent insurance agent and I recall a scenario a couple of years ago where he was going to have to cancel  a premises liablity policy because of the particular breed of dog that was on the premises.  Rotweillers, German Shepherds and Pitbulls are three of the types of breeds that would cause a policy to be cancelled.  3.  The #2 factor is the number of people on the premises.  With the open-ness of the house that we are anticipating, that is many people coming over to visit, there is no way that the dog could ever be on the first floor without the owner and the leash.  That means the dog has to be kept on the second floor, locked in a room at all times.  Hmmmmmmmm.   The dog cannot be in the back yard, as it is anticipated that the yard will also be used, and from personal experience, it is no fun living next to a large breed dog that is in the back yard.  That is not something that should be done to the neighbors, or the back yard.  4.  The 3rd factor the baord must consider is the health issue.  WIth there being a certain number of people, we are going to come across at least one person who is allergic to dogs, as I am allergic to cats, and that is not fair to them.  There is also the issue of our visually challenged participant and his son, and an animal is an additional hazard for them, on the second floor.  I would put this to a vote of the board, but frankly, this is not our decision, it is that of the owner and his insurer.  And what I have consistently advised him and his Realtor/Property Manager in the past is to not allow anything more than small dogs on a premises.  The owner has this blog link, and I need not contact him to know what his response will be.  Bottom line, is that a large dog is something that you get when you have your own place all to yourself.  And for the record, Peoria Recovery Houses, cannot have cats, because I am allergic to them, and as much time as I have to spend in this house and will spend in future houses, we just can't do cats either.  Go fish!  Chase Ingersoll

      Chase,  Greg informed me that a friend from work gave him a puppy. I guess that it is a full blood Rot. It is supposed to be a cute little thing. He says that he plans to keep it in his room. He thought that you should know. I asked him if he asked you, he said that he didn't think that he had to. I am not cleaning up no dog poop, and I better not step in it! That dog would look awful funny with my foot hanging out of his ass.  I also talked to bonnie, and told her what you had posted. I didn't have a copy to give her. She said that she gave a completed application to Jim. She wants to get a hold of you because she wants in now, or as soon as possable. She said that she is more than willing to clean the place up, just supply the supplies. She is staying at the Salvation Army, and is going crazy. You should expect her call.   I have not been able to get a hold of Sherese yet, but I am still trying.

      I whole heartedly believe that the Recovery House is going to affect the community. I hope that it does anyway, in a positive mannor obviously. When talking about the group as a whole, you come up with some pretty good analogys Sir Chase. I am just going to throw it out there, but I wonder if you come up with this stuff while sitting in front of your computer, wearing nothing but your poop stained briefs, occasionally munching on a few cashews.  Maybe while catching a game of tennis on the old boob tube while savoring the cheesy, yet crunchy can of planters cheese balls.   Pay backs a bitch.

      I am not so above myself that I can't admit when I am wrong. You totally missed the point. You do not know me, and have never met my wife, or child. You have no idea what I am capeable of as far as my disability is concerned, and I know that you had no idea what was going on with me as far as your comments that you made in the past three weeks. All I was saying was: investigate a little before you comment. Weather you know it or not, your comments are taken into consideration. Therefore, affecting the decision of the board. Sorry, Rob, your ignorance about the situation left you open, and looking clueless. I took offense to the fact that you do not know me, and made your decisions based entirely on the comments of others. What I am suggesting now is, come see for yourself. Don't go making decisions solely on the remarks of others. There are bits of pieces of information left out. I understand now, more than ever, that it is important to gather all of the facts before making a decision, especially when the life of another is, or could be affected.  I also made a claim that you were not present at any of the board meetings that I was. The remark that Sir Chase made was that you may have been present at the meeting that took place yesterday. I can guarantee that you werent. A room full of people attending an A.A.  meeting, and a board meeting is a hell of a difference. Nice try though, I will give you that. Better luck next time.

      I don't specifically recall, but generally I do remember a lot of issue with the guys in the house wanting to run something some way or structure something in some way that Craig and I absolutely knew from experience, was just flat wrong and going to cause problems.  The difficulty is that on some things we could step back and let guys learn from their own mistakes, but on other things, we had to draw the line and just say no pre-emptively, and no you can't even try that.  The reason for that was that we are responsible for the whole and for how that whole of the house affects each other and affects the outside community.  As a whole we cannot allow choas and will try to pre-empt it.  Individually, we can advise and guys can make their own choices.  But where that choice crosses boundaries into some other guys territory, that is where we have the obligation to that fellow to pre-empt that if possible and most certainly address the issue once it has happened.    This is an issue that you see in families, prison and in neighborhoods.  And it has been especially interesting of my observations of prisoners and former prisoners.  The number one thing that they want from supervisors is JUSTICE. And they want it fast, they want it fair and they want it pre-emptively if possible.   I also recall that desire in my own family growing up.  And I particularly recall its absence.    In my family the youngest child was always right. And I was the eldest child.  The exception was the one girl.  She was the trump cards and would always be right over the six brothers.  So by the age of 15 - I was no longer living in that house.  But 20 years later, I see the effects when my siblings and I are together.  Some of them still feel "enititled" to be right and have the upper hand or last word in everything that they do towards me.  One brother in particular is still completely without perspective and understanding in how he demands that his thoughts and ideas be the best and greatest and that most suredyly his lowly eldest brother, acknowledge the youngers superiority in all of these areas.  The irony in my life is that no other person had more of an effect on me to quit drinking.  His drinking insantiy was 100 times mine, but the danger and potential for loss that I saw in his behavior, left such a bad taste in my mouth that I initially quit drinking more for what I saw it doing in his life, than for what I saw it doing in mine.  That catalyst was enough to cause me to quit drinking for six months, and in that time experience situations and make observations that then caused me to leave alcohol behind completely for the last 13 years.  But rather than resenting the imbalance and injustice in the relationship between us, last year I simply chose to walk away from its toxicity and let him reflect on my lengthy silence and perhaps as he ponders it, he will come up with the truth about the situation and himself, of which I was never able to persuade him.  So I have sidetracked here, but the point is that we all want justice and we want it now.  The problem is however, that for many, justice will not be reeived in this lifetime.  Earth being the earthly place that it is, the evil man will die peacefully in his bed and be lauded at the finest funeral home in the city, while the champion of justice may die from a blow in the street and have his corps donated to science.  But  I will not leave you guys hanging, the way my father left me when I was 13, with the question: Was there a sign over your crib in the hospital that said.....life is fair?     22 years later, I know that my response should have been.....the question dad, is not whether life is being fair to me, but rather are you fair to me and are you doing everything you can, to see that I am fairly treated.  The biblical precept for that is that we are comanded to "...do justice...and walk rightly...toward all men..."  And that is the concept regarding accountability and taking others inventory, if we are to expect justice from others, we must first do justice.  Likewise with mercy.  And particulaly in the case of this Recovery House, I am not asking any of you to do anything, or make any sacrifices that I have not been making for the last 13 years.  If I appear short, to the point and very adamant about certain things, it is because I and others have been doing them for a very long period of time and I know that they work.  Despite that, one of the most difficult things for anyone and especially addicts, is to trust and in many cases, you will have to trust what you cannot see, by having to go and look for evidence to support what I may tell you. The most direct evidence that you have of what I tell you, is the fact that you are at 1016 Madison tonight and not somewhere else.  If at any time you doubt what I say, wander your mind through all of the many circumstances it took to place you there and consider that I was preparing that place for you, long before I ever met you.   If I can believe and make that effort for an unseen and unknown person.  So can you.  That is what I expect from all of you.  Chase Ingersoll

      I I have known Bonnie for at least a year. I see her at the 8a.m. meetings often. So if I may, I will talk to them both. Maybe Jim will print your thought. As for Mark, and Greg, Who knows? I am sure that they will help. I will ask them. There is not much that i can do physically, but I know how to clean up some stuff. I am more than willing.   I had no idea that there was such a house for women, otherwise i would have never suggested that she live here. I do know that sherese had two and a half years clean, and then relapsed solely because of her living arrangements. I know that I would not be able to live with anyone who is using any kind of drug in front of me, especially on a daily basis, and not get into the mix myself. It would be impossible.  As for Bonnie. I think that was the woman that when there was talk about my wife moving to Peoria about five or six months ago, that was who she was going to stay with. I feel that Bonnie is sick and tired of being sick and tired.   Jim just informed me that he did print your message chase, and I will talk to those women. If there is anything else that I can do to help, please let me know.  For the record: I do not want to be on this blog bitching about each, and everything. Believe it or not, I do want to help. Like I said previously, there is not much I can do, but I understand that I must give back in order to keep what I have. Once again, I am greatful for the opportunity to express my opinion.

      It's interesting that I have been there, Matt, while you were present, with you not having a clue. So much for your sixth sense. Seems like your Spidey sense would have alerted you to someone grabbing your unmentionables.  I remember when I was in early recovery, and thoght those who didn't see things the way I did were idiots. I was merely stating my opinion on several issues, not personally attacking anyone. If anyone was offended, maybe they should take it up with the resident RET guru. I actually believe Jim to be quite competent as resident rat.   I also remember being in a recovery house, always cosigning my roomates' stuff, as it was a family type atmosphere. It's nice to see you guys sticking together. You may not agree wth me, nor I you, but the beauty of this program allows me the freedom to be ok enough with myself to express my thoughts and opinions. Keep coming back, it gets different.   I would like to apologize for not being present more at the house, could someone please let me know when the house meetings are?

      I have a house available for a women.  My concern is that we are still ironing out the details among men, and so far are only exception has been a spouse.  To throw a single woman in a daily living environment and make them partially accountable or subservient to, each and every man on the premises is very concerning.    The person that I would like to hear from is her sponsor.  I know that a sponsor, looking at her past, which most suredly consists of dysfunction with men and with jobs is going to share my concerns.  This is one of those issues that will not be decided by the people in the program.  It will be determined by the board and will probably not be a quick decision.  I don't know if you know Bonnie, but I discussed with her long before she left for Rockford about being placed in a woman's recovery house and perfroming the function of Jimmy the Rat.  Bonnie also has past experience in such an environment.  The starting point is as follows.   I have a partially furnished duplex at 810/12 NE GLendale.  It needs very little to be in move in condition.  It could be structured to have as many as 6 bedrooms.   The rate would be $40 per week or less and that would cover the rent, utilites, phone and cable.  The women there would have access to the first floor of 1016 Madison and the laundry and computer.    They would also be welcome to use the large kitchen at 1016 Madison for nightly dinners and meetings.    I am not comfortable putting just one woman there to start off.  So we need to get a Bonnie and Sharice combination.  Both would be required to line up a job, prior to getting in.  The issue there is that it needs to be required of them so that they can understand and explain to future participants why that is a requirement.  I would like for someone to print this out and for the five of you to discuss it and make a list of what you can contribute to get the house on Glendale going for the girls. Obviously Greg and Mark would have the ability (if they have the time) to make the place look a lot nicer than it currently does. If you do this, I will be the first to give you credit and expect the gals to show you some gratitude in some healty ways.     If you want to be involved with this, I think it is a very commendable effort on all of your parts,  but I want to you keep your motives, absolutely clean and I want you to accept my and the boards guidance on this so that the process for these gals is smoother than the process has been for you.  Again, it is extremely commendable for any and all of you to be thinking of these women like Bonnie and Charise.  Chase

      Welcome aboard Matt!!!  I knew you would really jump into it with both feet so to speak!  I think I have to agree with Jimmy the Rat when he said we need to keep things on a positive note though.  This means you too Chase / Rob etcetera.  I think we can learn a few things from the late Dr. Norman Vincent Peale who wrote "The Power of Positive Thinking". Let's take this a step further to the power of positive living. We live positively and people around us see this and react positively towards us.......try it - it's amazing.  I've noticed that people around the AA community are noticing the Recovery House and by our successes we will continue to grow. Conversely, by our setbacks we will fail.  Lets continue to communicate as board members, residents (future board members) and others.  The more feedback we have from others, the better the future decisions will be.  I would even like to hear from folks who read this blog who are not on the board or a resident.   Jim F. has some good views and I have asked him to get on. If I know Chase, I am sure he has invited others to read this BLOG.  Lets hear some comments!  Doug

      Sherese has brought it to my attention that she would like to move in. She is struggleing to stay clean because she has no choice, but to live with her currently using alcoholic grand mother. There other still active in using drugs living in that house such as her brother. I am not sure, but I think that Jim has brought it to the attention of the board of being able to use a "House Mom". Someone to cook meals for the entire house- clean. I think that I am not alone when I say that every house could use a womans touch unless the house is inhabited by a same sex couple, and even then one of the two picks up the feminin trait. Further, Sherese has expressed an intrest in this position. However, cooking for several people is a tedious task, and would like to be compisated for her labor. Basically, she wants to move in with some sort of a subsidized rent. I think that Sherese would be a valuable asset to the Peoria Recovery House, not just for the time being, but in the future as well. Especially when the guys from Sheridan come along. I also beleive that this will also help work out the feeding situation that was discussed at our in- formal house meeting that took place this past saturday morning. One main issue that was brought up was the different work schedules. Sherese would eliminate this problem, and would be greatful for being allowed to. In turn, this would also help pull a fellow addact/ person out of a bad situation.   Thanks for listening.

      Rob,  The more that you write, the more that you prove that your an idiot. You offering your unprofessional psycho analysis based on the comments of others without researching the issue at hand, proves my theory entirely. Please forgive using the fact that I am using your attack on Jim to launch my own retaliation for the comments that you made against me in your previous post. What I am getting at is: Do a little bit of digging, talk to the person, or people that the issue is about. By doing so, you will be able to make some what of an educated decision. Therefore, making yourself look less like an ass.  To the rest of the blockers:  Please forgive me for coming aboard, and jumping right into an insult. I have been to at least two meetings as a resident of Peoria Recovery House. All known board members (except for Rob) were present, and all of these issues were discussed. I just thought that he needed to be checked and let him know that not only I, but the rest of all people who logs on the recovery house's website, knows that he does not have a clue.

      I would like this opportunity to welcome Matt to this Recovery House information board and encourage him to post. In my opinion this is a place for productive information as well as constructive criticism.  We are fallible human beings and require input that will help us all to become better human beings.  I for one believe that this is serious business and I try my best to be constructive in my opinions.   Jimmy The Rat

      Per the Board Meeting last night:  1.  Rob:  you need to drop by the house more often.   2.  Guys coming in, need to be immediately notified that observations about them, will be posted on the Blog, and it may not be things that they like, but that they are entitled to respond.  Recovery House must be consistent with the First Amendment in the Bill of Rights;  3.  However, being that there are felons on the premises, the 2nd Amendment does not apply at recovery house, and in keeping with that philosophy, we do not take each other on mano-a-mano, but rather blogger-to-blogger;  4.  Further, as the Recovery House is a family unit there is in reality NO PRIVACY, so it is now explicitly stated that there shall be no effort to provide or expectation of privacy.  And I feel no sympathy for anyone on that, because I have taken goofballs out of treatment, to come and stay with me, and they do lots of talking in meetings and elsewhere about me and my family, and there is nothing I can do about it.  And actually, I think the more they talk the better.  And we all know how the song goes - "I WANNA TALK ABOUT ME"   Actually, I don't have to talk about me, BECAUSE EVERYONE ELSE IS....  5.  The role of the Recovery House Board Member must also be clearly stated and repeated to the new participants.  Guys coming out of Prison seem to feel that Jim is there to rat to the board about the residents.  I have consistently maintained that he is there to let us know what is going on and to act as a stabilizing influence for someone who might be struggling.  He is not there to babysit.  But since guys coming out of prison, sometimes just feel the way they feel.  I suggest that we accomodate them and henceforth, Jim shall be known to the program participants as...........JIMMY THE RAT.   I think that if we lowball their expectations, with such a label, it will be easier on them, than to let them think that Jim is just there to be their friend and listen to their beefs.  Jim may be those things, but let's just make it clear that his #1 function, may in fact to be to rat out someone that is using.    6.  Guys are obviously not reading the program contract and are not clear that the reason for removal from the house, is for relapse, financial irresponsibility, and any criminal activity.  The other stuff is just the normal stupid crap you see in families and see with recovering addicts.  The difficulty in the house will be that there is new people, changes and problems and feelings, but these goofballs are now having to actually deal with the issues, rather than walking away and isolating and going back to drinking or drugging.  And that really is a HUGE change for them.  So don't expect any of them to handle it perfectly.  7.  Also it was pointed out that the guy who is the most troublesome today and stuggling the most today, may in fact be the fellow best equipped to assist a similar fellow - tomorrow.  The effort we invest in the people struggling the most, may in fact have the greatest reward and benefit to us and everyone else.  So keep this in mind when someone seems to be trying to win the STUPID ADDICT OF THE WEEK award.  8.  Mark my words, the greatest slight is going to be not what is said on this blog, but rather it will be for the poor fellow who is never mentioned at all.  Chase Ingersoll

      Maybe your stuff got stolen because you were a putz. Is that rational or irrational? Maybe we could do less with the RET 101, and look at individuals with our senses and feelings. Have you ever seen socks and underwear at a garage sale that wasnt in a trailer park? No, because the general population doesnt dig used undergarments. Maybe the person who stole yours was rational, with a sense of humor.

      Jim Maybe the guy just has an irrantional urge to bug the crap out of you. If that is it, you got to hand it to him - there is a beautiful simplicity about his method.  Or maybe it is a typically passive aggressive trap.  Leave yourself open to being robbed, so that you can then enjoy catching and beating the crap out of the thief.  I just better not hear about his socks and underware being found in your room.  Did I tell you the one about the guys that kept leaving all of the tools out at night.   I kept asking, but they would never start cleaning up, putting the tools away and securing the place.  So I came down to the jobsite early one morning and snagged all the stuff that they left out, propped a window open, left the door unlocked and tossed the tools in the truck.  I came back a little later and there they were filing a police report.  Boy was the cop, confused.  I explained to him that there had been a crackhead running around selling tools, so I was concerned that the guys were leaving the stuff out.  What I didn't tell him, was that the guys had actually bought some tools from the crack head.  As for the guys - I mentioned to them, that now they knew how the guy who lost the tools they bought - how he might be feeling...  Ha Ha Ha.  Chase

      In the AA program the term stinking thinking is often used.  This type of thinking can be thought of as irrational.  Irrational thinking can be a threat to continued recovery and therefore it should be brought to the attention of the individual.  As an example we have an individual who lives here and only has a few weeks of sobriety.  I noticed he doesn’t keep his door locked when he is not in the house.  I casually mentioned it to him and his response was why should I have nothing of value. I remember my first duty station in the service. When I arrived I needed to wash my socks and underwear. I then hung them in my room (didn’t have a key} to dry while I went to a movie. When I arrived back to my room someone made off with all my socks and underwear. The moral to this story is we all have things of value.  All other residents in Recovery House keep their room doors locked for palpable reasons.  His thinking is irrational because a rational thinking person would be concerned about this possibility and the other feelings of other residents if they were accused of theft.

      The recover house is now full and enjoying some stability.   Today we had an informal house meeting and discussed several issues including cleaning supplies, and other necessary housekeeping items. At the house meeting I did remind everyone about the basic requirement for a meeting a day.  This met with a favorable response but Greg remarked I would rather want to then have to.  My response was that it is a house rule and must be adhered to for residence in recovery house.    Mark moved in yesterday and has been confined to the premises due to a requirement of his situation. He has employment and plans to return to work Tuesday after completing the necessary requirements of his situation.  John has employment and appears to be very strongly committed to his recovery program  Matt has calmed down somewhat and is adjusting to the program.  I connected his laptop to the recoverhouse router and he is now surfing.  Greg is also working and going to meetings but he has very little sobriety and seems to be going through some internal problems.  I am not sure if he has a sponsor but has never said anything about one to me.  He will be getting a paycheck next week and hopefully will use it for a good purpose.

      Matt was seen late night with a........woman? Someone call Ken Starr. Good to hear Matt is doing well. Jimmy G. is doing a nice job dealing with issues that arise, nice work Jimmy. A cookout sounds good, lets get as many people involved as possible when we get a date set. Addicts will usually turn up for free food. Some may even bring something. Maybe some kind of speaker function could be set up?   The first recovery house was Delta House without the booze, well, usually. Having Jim there should help with the overall feel of the house. Hopefully there won't be any strip club group outings or porn fiestas on the computer.

      Jim:  funny that you refer to PRH as a fraternity house with out the booze or drugs, and then Matt stays out all night.  For the record, married guys cannot do that, when the last person they are seen with, is a woman. I'm sure that his sponsor will back that up.  Give him a chance to explain, it may very well have been a night of excessive coffee drinking at Denny's.  But this guys needs some activity during the day to keep him going, in addition to meetings.  I suggest that we have the discussion with his counselor ASAP.  Chase

      The less you say, the more room you give for others to defend you. I'm not going to leave Matt's defense of me, on the table as his opinion and allow the rest of you to respond directly too it, without my comment.....for a while.  I am hoping that you will do likewise in the house meetings when someone criticizes you.  Also:  I can certainly understand mark's predicament with lunch, as that was the problem that my wife had with dinner.  The solution is probably going to be found in MARKING FOOD, but particularly in our gewtting involved in the SHARE FOOD program, so that people who have not, are covered.     Small point - I'm sure the person who has been eating Mark's food, has not done so because they are intending to express the CONTEMPT or DISRESPECT for Mark, but rather that they are simply hungry and without, and are relying on their old way of just taking what they want or need, rather than commmunicating that need to others and accepting what others will help them with and what the other's expectations will be for that help.  I think that specifically what we are going to have to do as a board, is organize our participation in the SHARE FOOD and the have the expectation that everyone will participat.

      What is the common denominator in a multi human living environment? Cleanliness and order. A mess here, a mess there, speaks to the mess in our heads. If we are sloppy and cluttered, often our lives are that way too. Sometimes doing things like making the bed, doing a dish, etc., are the small tasks many of us never did, and are the easiest place to start caring enough about ourselves to do.  Just my experience: please no extended, fluffy dialogue to overtake my opinion. It takes up space and is really not productive for any of us. If it does not fit you, put it back and pick up the next one. At least that is what open-mindedness means to me.

       Choose your battles.   Care enough about others to clean up after ourselves.   I find it interesting to read a bunch of stuff on here that can be said in a very few words.   Yet, I also find it interesting that Chase is able to covertly sneak in a treatise on the abortion issue.  I am whole-heartedly against it and snicker to myself that this is an interesting forum for the issue.  I guess any forum in a storm?  In times of war, any hole is a trench.     Matt good post, but I think the point Chase is making is that we have the tendancy to over analyize situations that used to baffle us.  Welcome to the blog - Colleen.

      A year ago, at the Recovery hosue at 905 Madison, Rob was one of the first people there, and in the Oxford House model, fines were a part of that system.  The Board at that time, which was Craig and I, were very much hands off in regards to what went on and let the guys decide for themselves.  That was the Oxford model we were trying.  But all of the guys were just out of treatment, and you can't really fine somone that has a job, or who is just going to leave anyway.  There is absolutely no comparison between the level of individuals that we have at 1016 vs 905 last year, and no comparision in the level of my involvement with the people inhabiting 1016 and the women's house.   Last year I was gone for six weeks.   Do any of you care to imagine what things would have been like the last six weeks if I had been 1500 miles away?  I'd like some of your thoughts on that.  I will also note, that the way you guys have cleaned up this house and keep the kitchen is 100% better than the situation a year ago.    But on the "domestic issues"  could you imagine my wife fining me, for leaving dirty dishes in the sink, or for the mess I make around the house?   Could you have imagined us trying to fine the people who live with us for the moldy dishes?   It was bad enough to have to continually ask someone to change their behavior, but what I have observed in life is that you may not be the person who will see the change.     Bottom line is that people will do things that irritate and offend you, but if you want to have a life, you cannot spend all of your time confronting everyone for every behavior.  Life will do that for them.  You have every right to pick and chose which behaviors you feel the need to confront and to what level you desire to confront it.  You can also chose the time and place to confront the behavior.   That is your right.   One other note:  you are not being disrespected when someone does not clean up after themselves.  WHen people are inconsiderate, it is because  they are thoughtless.  They would be doing the same thing regardless of whether or not you were there to be irritated.  If you want to call them irresponsible, inconsiderate or irrational, that might be appropriate.  But I don't know what teacher or coach, accused you of disrespect for your lack of performance, timeliness, etc.   But you didn't fail to turn in that report because you did not respect the teacher....you didn't turn it in because you were up all night playing video games.    It would be interesting to look back into time and see where you got that perception of the definition of respect and its applicability.   Let me know how goes the self psychoanalysis on this subject.  Chase Ingersoll

      Hi Colleen, hope you find what you are looking for in life and in recovery.  Nice to have you aboard in the Female recovery house.  It is my experience that these "house meetings" generally turn ugly for various reasons. Primarily because noone in the house has any real long term recovery. A group of people relatively new to recovery are going to be more interested in pointing out others' behaviors, being right, and defending their positions with great vocabularies, than they are willing to sacrifice some of that for the better of the group. Things will get better as long as some consistency and longevity from at least one, ideally 2, people reside there. Change is hard, especially when it is in your face 24/7.  Another reason is that even if as a majority the group decides on a process or rule, noone enforces it consistently, and, if they do, they back off because they realize it's not the popular thing to do to get people to like them.  You might try a fine system, where one who doesn't clean up his own mess after a period of time is assessed a fine,or some consequence for the behavior.  This can be enforced as a group, without personal feelings being involved. The problem I see with Chase's method of doing nothing and expecting nothing to change is that nothing changes. If I celebrate a person leaving due to his unacceptable behavior, and do nothing but tell others about it, not only is that passive-aggressive, it allows that person to practice the unchecked behavior on others. Nor should I clean up after them, that is called enabling. I should point out their behavior and create a situation where it is overtly unacceptable, and where there is a consequence involved. A cake that says "Glad to See You Leave" is  not a consequence, it is a childish, demeaning thing to do.  Perhaps making the intolerable behavior unacceptable and out in the open is more appropriate.

      People change, and so will Recovery House, and the addictive mind, wants people to recognize how they have changed, even while denying that others will or have changed.  Sundays meeting was not the bitch fest that people have described before.  Why?  Answer: In previous meetings, someone would complain about someone and that person in typical addictive  behavior would jump to defend themselves.  And they were not very good at defending themeselves.  Yes, they defended themselves passionately.  But they put up stupid defenses.  And when I would try to defend them, they would not let me talk, or let me finish what I was trying to say, or allow the other person to answer the questions that I would be asking.   Defensive.....Childish....and they would then accuse the person accusing them.  This time around, the complaints were about people that were not there, so I defended those people by asking questions of everyone and then proposing actions that are in keeping with the philosophies and principals that have been developed over the years.  The two most applicable in regards to the main issues Sunday concerning people not showing up at the meeting, were:  1.  Addicts hate rules.  Make something mandatory and they will not want to do it.;  2.  The more absolute rules that we have, the more time and energy we are going to spend enforcing those rules and arguing about who got away with what, and who is getting special treatement;  3.  Any time we can encourage the behavior that we desire, by reward, rather than punishment, why would we not at least fully attempt all of the different rewards that might work, before we start thinking about how to punish people.  I find it amusing, how addicts, who have received much punishment, and often arbitrary punishment in the case of those who have experienced controling parents and/or incarceration or the military, are none-the-less, quick to want to punish each other for minor infractions or bending of the rules.    The rational used is accountability, but accountability for what people are obivious to, should be gentle.   At least at first.  Concious disregard of others rights, and our greatest obligations is probably where firm accountability needs to begin.   But disregarding the trash, or forgetting to phone in..............that is not a concious dissing of others rights.   It probably has more to do with uncertainty and distraction of the person who just seems to not see it.  You don't seem to realize how much of a family you are.  Absence making the heart grow fonder, I have no doubt that if any of you spent a fortnight with your relatives, many of these same irritations would arise.   Last year, it was three days into a vacation in San Diego with my wifes relatives, when I had my sister in law, on my ass because I never helped prepare the meals or clean up.   Of course I could have argued the obvious.......I was not there for many of the meals.   In a family with 7 daughters, the women seem to pretty much take over the kitchen scene, etc, etc........    But rather than argue with her, when I knew what was really bugging her was that she works for planned parenthood, and she knows that I consider abortion to be murder, and that her two kids are undisciplined brats, and she saw me reading Dr. Dobson's DARE TO DISCIPLINE, so I just suggested that she tell me exactly what she would like me to do, how she would like me to do it, and when and that I would be more than happy to do whatever she wished.............  I don't think she knew quite what to do with that.    I don't think it let her have the argument that she was looking for, so she just became flustered and gave me some sort of minor task....like taking out the garbage..........and that was that.   Really quite funny in retrospect.  This year, I took a pass on that family vacation in San Diego, and spent it with guys from the Recovery House, getting some things done at my house and yours.    And I had a lot of fun with people who were interested in getting to know me, and vice versa, rather than having to sit there and listen to my sisters in law bash President Bush over his support of fetal life and support of the liberation of the Iraqi people.    One thing I like about people in Recovery is that they can accept what they have done wrong in the past.............even if it is stuff like abortion.......and not try to argue that it is not something that it is......killing an innocent human being.     And in some ways, just coming to a rational sanity about what it was that we really did, puts us on the road to understanding it and accepting forgiveness.    I've mentioned it before, but I think it is worth repeating.....If you can learn to deal with living in a house with 10 diverse personalities and experiences, by applying the principals that you have learned in recovery, you are going to be a Jedi Master, when it comes to living with a spouse and a couple of kids.   So fill the house.  Learn to live and let live.  Let go of the small stuff.  And show up Sunday for the barbeque.  Thats when we are going to feed the gals that work our block.  As I stated Sunday........"you used to  _ u c k  them.  Now you are going to feed them. "  Chase Ingersoll

                  First and foremost, I would like to make it aware that I appreciate the advocacy. My defense is as follows. Last week I was in my room sick, and sleeping. I was informed of what took place, and what was said about my where about. Someone said that they saw me leave. This was obviously a lie. Here I am beating a horse that no one cares about seeing how this issue is a week old. This week I left, and went to River Side, and then tucked away at a very good friend’s house in the program. The meeting there was a very good one, and lasted an hour, and a half. This story could almost be impossible to back up, but guess who was there? Yep… Rob!!!  I kind of like the idea of rewarding those who show up next week with a cook out, but I am still strongly considering taking a rain check...  Chase, you said it all when you posted your last post. Even though this is house is supposed to be family oriented, it is not, nor will it ever be. Everyone in this house is cut from a different type of fabric. You said that we were just going to have to deal with it if someone is a slob, and you are right…, but nobodies mother lives here, and it seems as if some people think that she does. Sorry, but I am blind, and I have a hard enough time taking care of, and cleaning up after myself, let alone someone else, or a bunch of others for that matter. My solution to this problem. I make a mess, and clean it up. I dirty a dish, I wash them right away. I use, and reuse the same glasses. This alleviates any responsibility of the immediate area of being a mess on me. I do not expect anyone to clean up after me, nor will I clean up after anyone else.  From what I understand, the house meeting is being declared a battle field. It seems that once the issues of what the house’s need with respect to furniture, and repairs, is an all out war between residents. People taking shots at one another, and complaining about one another’s conduct. If one person tells another that he needs to do this, or that, then a tic for tack now takes place. Anger flares, and resentments build. In front of Chase, the situation may look resolved, but when he is gone the house returns to the same mind set creating havoc within our home.  What kind of chaos? When people start disliking one another like this, they start to not have any respect for them, or their property. Chase, I know that you don’t like the respect thing, but let’s get real. You have to respect each other. Disrespect falls into different categories. The two main ones is: Taking (without permission) others food. Someone has been just helping themselves to Marks lunch materials. Not leaving messages when people call, and when they come in, and you ask them if anyone called, and you say “No.” because your mad at them because they busted you out.  I used to do the dishes for every body until I seen that it was being taken advantage of. When I was on the phone, I used to get off when someone else called for somebody else; until I found out they weren’t doing it for me. I have had police call me for speaking engagements, and to give me quotes. My aunt who lives in Wisconsin, my wife who lives 300 miles away to tell me what she found out at the doctors today. I am here alone with no family. I can’t just get up and go visit people. I use the phone a lot. When other people are on it, they should at least give me the message that whosoever called. Who knows what is going on? After that has been happening for 2 weeks now, I just don’t care anymore. It seems as if these resentments against me would disappear after a couple of days, but I guess not... Now someone else is cosigning that same bull shit… Nevertheless, all’s well.  So I am not sure if I want to be a part of this war. I am not getting involved in any more nonsense. Someone else is not that serious because I don’t have to live their life. They know what it is going to take to change, and if they refuse…  Hey, Welcome colleen. Glad to know that you are aboard. I am looking forward to hearing from you.

      1.  Serious concern expressed by participants who showed up at meeting about those who did not.  Jim and I played devil's advocate on behalf of those who were not there, and I think that we did a better job of defending you than you would have done yourselves.   Hopefully you WILL attend the next House Meeting, WHICH HAS BEEN CHANGED FROM 5:00 PM  on Sunday evenings to HIGH NOON on SUNDAYS.   The change was made to better accomodate those who could not make it and thereby free up the rest of your sunday for various meetings and family activities.  Obviously there were parties at the 5:00 pm who were offended in that despite their inconvinience they respected everyone enough to show up.   CHASE's philosophy on the way to handle this is rather than seeking compliance/attendance at meetings with a stick (i.e. consequences) we might have a much better time of things if we simply rewarded those who do show up.   The method of doing that, will be to have a Sunday grill, right after the meeting.    It was also mentioned that if there is beef and brats on the barbeque, people are going to want to baste their beef, rather than beef and bitch at the meeting.    Said another way, people are less likely to want to waste time complaining about other people in the house and arguing when they are hungry and food is available.  2. Still some beefing about messes and garbage.   Also about hte sawdust.  The party responsible for the sawdust was "Norm" from this old house.  Please just take care of the dust and any mess that is "Norms" as "Norm" is a very busy person this last week designing bed frames.  3.  We will get an IN and OUT board.  THe idea is that you will mark the out as to when you will be back, so that people feel better knowing and that they can tell someone who calls or stops by the house without having to search the house and knock on all of the bathroom doors.  4.  We have a couple of guys that are interested in the house, so we need to finish up the floor and bath in the basement.  Stan did a good job Saturday and I will try to get the trailer there ASAP to load up the stuff that was cleaned out.  5.  I will check on the SHARE FOOD program and food pantries so that people who move in can stock up right away and get going on their job search.  6.  Remind me to order the Journal Star for the house - so as to help people look for jobs.  7.  THe computer table is in and the computer will be up shortly.  8.  The dryer needs a switch.  Jim may be able to test that, and the refrigerator thermostat at the gals house.  9.  The girls have RECOVERY HOUSE iron ons and T-shirts, so get with them and have a party.   Please wear the shirts as often as you can.  It lets people know we are there and what we are about.  10.  One last thing - sometimes people are just going to be slobs and we are going to have to accept that.  I had a guy (some of you know him) that came to stay with my wife and I when he got out of White Oaks.  He had a habit of eating for lunch, what my wife was readying for dinner, and then for dinner he would grill horrible smelling meat and leave the mess.  Of course he would then disappear (to meetings in the evening) before we could remind him to clean up his meaty mess.   Either we would have to smell that greasy mess all night, or we could clean it up. And of course there was the cups, plates and silverware that would disappear and be found in his room.....full of mold.      He stayed with us for the better part of 8 months, and I kid you not, we had a party the evening that he was to be on the bus and on his way to San Francisco.    Funny thing was, he missed his bus and was sitting in our kitchen, as I returned from the store with ice cream and a cake that said...........HE IS GONE!  Boy was he pissed........he stormed out of the house after taking 30 minutes to yell at me and he stayed down at 905 Madison that night.   Oh well, we had a good laugh, and I knew his little alcoholic mind would get quite a workout fuming on that 72 hour bus ride to San Francisco.  And yes - this guy has still periodically called to see how we are doing.  The point of all of this, is that it is a good thing to be like Stanley and just tolerate people for a while.  Don't worry about you setting them strait, as life will do that for you.  The Highest Power, says that Vengence is His, not ours, and that He will repay.   And believe me........He always does and in a far fairer and funnier manner than we could ever imagine.  Chase Ingersoll  and has done a lot for the h0use.

      The problem  is that there is not a written rule as to anyone staying out past midnight without notifying the house.  So far it has been a courteous agreement between the people in the house.  When approaching an addict with an accusation of relapse or other important issue, one had better have a lock tight case and have already figured out what the addict will use as loopholes.   Knowing what you think you and others might know about what someone is doing, the appropriate action is to continue to look at the situation with heightened scrutiny.  I am not going to make an issue over comments that an AWAA  "Addict With An Attitude"  happens to make.  If only I had a dollar for every AWAA that called me an asshole, or said that I don't know shit.  Please.....I do not need someone running to me every time someone "disses" me behind my back.  I learned 13 years ago, volunteering in a homeless shelter, that the people with unresolved issues, were going to be the first to make unreasonable demands, pout, whine and talk trash about you to others.   I also learned, that 99 times out of 100 it was best to just not give the "headline in their mind" any additional play by confronting them on it, and thereby giving them a stage for the little dramatics that they were trying to manipulate me into.  I'll deal with what I see in front of my face, when I chose to.  I don't have to deal with what someone says behind my back, especially when I know that everyone else knows the person, the context, and their credibility.  I still think that the best way to guage whether somone is headed to relapse, is to let them get a paycheck and see if they pay on Friday, or show up Sunday....broke. In that case, they are going to indict and convict themselves without anyone ever even accusing them of anything. Most of the drama which has been engaged in this house, has been caused, not by someone relapsing, but rather, by peoples SUSPICIONS of others, and the way they handle those suspicions.  You instruct me.....what is the best way to handle the situation where you suspect that someone is possibly violating rules, and or headed to relapse  In the meantime, please, all of you, why, if you are working an effective recovery program and are in the midst of several other people who are doing the same.........why should you feel so threatened by one person's possibly relapsing?  Many of you have spent considerable time surrounded, as the only person, surrounded by people still actively using.  Yet you were able to stay clean and sober and get out of the situation.  There is no way that your present situation does anything but pale by comparison, so what is it that you are sweating about?  Chase Ingersoll

      I found this service more than a year ago.   urlLink http://www.k7.net/index.htm   The faxes and voicemail come into your email box, as a sound file or graphic file.  You click on the email attachment and it plays the message.  I think that it also identifies the number from which the call was made.  The one thing is that the phone numbers that they assign you are a 206 area code.   But I don't think that is too much of a problem for somone who wants something for free.   The other thing is that you can check your email at the library and elsewhere and see who has called you, so that has obvious advantages over having an answering machine on the house phone, or having to come home and check the message board.  My suggestion is that everyone get a voicemail number, and if someone is not home, we have the list right there so that we can give the person their voicemail/fax and tell them to leave a message there.  That seems fair.  THe other huge benefit is that when a person moves on, or even to another recovery house - their number stays the same.  Please try this out as soon as possible and enter your phone number into your blog profile if possible.  Chase Ingersoll

      Indoor furniture cannot be outside on a porch.  It is ghetto and it is against code.  You might be able to get away with chairs, but with couches, someone will eventually file a complaint and Recovery House will get a big red sticker NOTICE TO ABATE and just like any crack house in the neighborhood.  We cannot go there.  We also have got to remove the grill from the front porch.  It can go on the back porch, but should be used only when off the porch, so as to not start a fire.  The back yard is closer to the kitchen anyway, so that is the place to grill.  Security:  the best security is having enough people so that someone is always around.    But you leave doors open often enough and you are eventually going to have a "bird" fly in.  It very well could have been me yesterday as Matt and I left at 11:00 am.  But I do not know that for a fact.  My intent is to shut the door always when I leave, but it is easy for a couple of people to get that responsibility mixed up when they are together.  We are now having too many people for anyone to be crashing on the couch.  As much time as I have spent there (and I am always DOING something when I am there) others of you have had a lot of down time there and more than enough time to finish a space, get your furniture moved downstairs and put together a real bed.   I did not go to all of the trouble to secure mattresses and lumber for beds, only to hear about a guys sleeping in a chair.  No more directory assistance or *69 calls.    I recall a circumstance in Springfield, where an Oxford House got on line, and did not realize with their business line at the house, they were being charged by the minute. They had a $1000.00 phone bill the next month.  That is a big hit for a house of six guys.  More on the Porch:  keep an eye out for suitable porch furniture.  Since the neighbor did their porch, we are going to have to do ours, so in the near future, you are going to be asked to scrape an paint, while you are on the porch to talk.  Chase

      Thanks for the support Doug. As for Mark, I second that motion. I am not sure what Miss Bonnie has planned for Labor day, but maybe we could plan the cook out for that week end? Sounds like a kick ass plan to me.  As for security? Are you serious. It's a shame that someone is to lazy to lock the door when they leav. I wonder who did that?

      Someone came by to visit the house yesterday and they found noone home and the front door wide open. You might want to be a little more careful as far locking your door. It's not like you live near the Ingalls family on Little House on the Prarie. If someones things come up missing, the blog will be inundated with "who took my stuff", and "who left the door open".  Might want to discuss security down there.

       Gotta love Matt. Here's a guy who has either come a long way in a short amount of time.....or a dude who can blow smoke up there with the best of them. I want to believe, he is - who he says he is - today. I can't say that I would be where he is at - given the same circumstances I think I would be tempted to sit around and feel sorry for myself all day long. Instead he seems to be more concerned about others. In his last talk, Bill W. said that caring for others (step 12) is the spiritual foundation of our program. Good job Matt. Lets elect Mark D. - chairman of the entertainment committee - to get the ball rolling on the cookout. Can I get a second on this motion? Needless to say, I am ready for some good food and fellowship with all the residents at the recovery house.

      For a second I thought my computer was fucked up again, but taking a closer look, I discovered that it wasn’t my computer at all. It was just typos. I had never heard my computer stutter like that before. It sounded like it had a bad case of the hic- ups.  In response to “Open your eyes”.  Let me see…. The last time I checked, everyone in this house has had more bad times than we could count, along with ups, and downs. It is obvious that we all have made bad choices, or we wouldn’t be in the situation that we all are in.  I remember when I first got here, and everything didn’t go my way, I thought that these people were playing with my life too. Especially when I thought that should be ran like this, and this should be ran like that. My major dilemma was that I had more clean and sober time than Jim, our house manager. Who was he to tell, or make suggestions as far as my recovery was concerned. I was so ignorant of the wisdom around this house, and I was the only resident at that time. I have been through so much, and now I am so grateful. What happened? I opened my eyes…, and in turn, opened my mind. I learned that God gave me two ears, and one mouth for a reason.... I shared that hoping that you would open your eyes, ears, and shut your mouth.  Forgive me for being so brutal, but I took major offense to you calling this house, and program of this house a farce. (In case you don’t know what a farce is, it is a much more sophisticated word for joke than joke.) Why, do you ask? I have been here from the beginning. I have done, and been through all of this shit so you didn’t have to. I have been challenged, verbally abused, and the reason for the boundaries that have been set. It sounds very self- centered, but everyone has to acknowledge that it is the truth. What I have learned is: The rules and boundaries that have been set are for a couple of reasons. Because the decisions that I made in the past, landed me in the shoes that I wear today. Because I live in an environment where I must share the space in which I inhabit with other people who have not made the best decisions in their lives. Therefore, I need to be protected, and my fellow residents need to be protected.   With omniscience of the reason of these rules, and even further, of the people ramming these guidelines up my ass, I have learned to appreciate them, instead of smiling while I was force fed. Which is what you are doing.  It’s okay Scott. You are not the first, and you will not be the last. I just hope that you learn from this experience. I did. Honestly, when I first got here I hated Jim, now I can honestly say that I love the rat. As for Chase, it goes without saying that I wouldn’t have pissed on fire to put him out. Now I whole heartedly appreciate him like never before. You may hate us at first, but when your mind clears, and this dust settles you will be able to look back and think “What the hell was I thinking”. That is the beauty of this program. Don’t give up. I am sure that you won’t, I like that trait you possess the most.  I can totally relate  As for the bowling, to late. I have already been. You should come once in a while, and get your ass kicked. Ha ha ha...  Bonnie, Welcom aboard. You should know that your wisdom is valued, and appreciated.

      These are my thoughts on the issue at 1016 Madison. While in my active addiction I manipulated men and yes I was very good at it. Because of this behavior is why I am starting over in my recovery? Today I have 40 days clean an its the honest truth. I have lots of concerns about what has happened last week with the girl being in the Men’s Recovery House First of all a lot of sobriety was threatened with a using addict in the Men’s Recovery House This particular girl had numerous options but was not willing to follow through. When I was beaten I became willing.  You can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make them drink. That’s my view on this issue.  I am sure I will have more views about issues in the future, but for now why keep beating a dead horse.  Just for your all information I am as happy as a pig in shit at the Woman’s Recovery House. Thanks for allowing me to participate in the Peoria Recovery House program for I am truly appreciative.  Respectively Yours   Bonnie

       Friday night has been the regular bowling night for Beewolf for quite some time.   We bowl at around 9 p.m. at Town and Country Bowl.  Lets try to get a contingency together and have the recovery house well represented.  I have guests that may be here from Mexico this weekend, but I may still attempt to be there.  Call me if you need a ride there.  253-4092   If none of the Beewolfers show up - we'll still have a good time.  The first time I went bowling with these guys, I had a blast.  I used to be in leagues and get pasted beyond recognition.  Here I was having a better time sober than I ever did wasted.  I think the first time Matt gets up there.....we turn him the wrong way and see how many other bowlers he can knock over.  Now that's bowling!!!!!!  Just kidding Matt.  Let the good times roll.......................   Hey, by the way.......the entertainment committee dropped the ball on the cookout.     I am ready to do this thing - lets elect a couple of co-chairpeople.  I decline on grounds it was my idea, but I will be ready to help.  Chase - anyone you think needs a special project on their plate?   This may be a good thing for a couple of guys to focus on.  I am sure whoever volunteers will do a great job.  Lets remember to invite Bonnie and the other residents of the women's recovery house.

      There is a midnight meeting at Sanity (905 NE Madison) on Friday if anyone is interested. For those who are night owls, you might want to check it out. A couple of people usually go to Steak and Shake afterward and hang out.  I hope to make it, but, that's 3 days away.  There is also a meeting on Wednesday at 7 pm and Thursday at 7 pm. Being right across the street from you, it's easily accessible. Hope to see you there sometime.  Almost forgot, Saturday and Sunday at 11 am at 905 as well.  There is also the 7 pm meeting at Avalon off of Forrest Hill on Friday night, usually hanging out happens afterward. If anyone has a list of numbers from their first NA meeting, dial a few up.  You can call me at 472-8651 if you dont have any numbers, and I can try to get you in contact with a ride. ( I don't drive, but many of my friends do)

      You all have been very honest with Scott about your thoughts and past experiences with this sort of situation.  But honesty without love is brutality, so I would suggest that you all having been so honest, now step up to the plate and each get with him and find out from him, what you can do to help him make it through the rest of the week and past any looming payday.  I would like to see you all getting together Wednesday and Thursday and planning to do something together on Friday night like bowling, or a movie so as to give those who are struggling a boost through payday and the weekend.

      This is not a racetrack or a courtroom where you play with peoples lives, nor a classroom or university with a professor or professional teacher.  This is something that you don't learn by WATCHING.  Giving an example- me, personally, I would rather have a person or sounselor who has actually been where I've been and shared some of life's ups and downs, bad choices and situations and had little or no direction.  WAKE UP AND OPEN YOUR EYES  This same person that was in our house is th same people that are outside of our house and across the street, next  door, in the house, at the meetings-our mothers, sisters, daughters, brothers, sons, aunts, wifes and friends.  What kind of message are we really sending in the street about our so called reovery house, and that our primary purpose is to carry the message to the addict who is still suffering. 1016 NE Madison-IN THE HOOD- is a joke. Also-how is it that a police canine 'Katie' is fiven the okay to let people know and refer them off the streets.  Will we turn our backs on them? They will be selfish, using, manipulative liers--too sick for us better people???? I think not.  One more thing, the question was asked of me why didn't we call women in recovery, that are working a decent program (yes Chase-there are some!) to help deal with this female. Well, WATCHING for 13 years I guess you didn't see that one.  Something to think about.  My objective is to refocus on my recovery and to apologize to all regarding this incident. I would like to thank you guys for you insight, suggestions, comments and I will strongly look at myself.  That's what this program has taught me-progress not perfection.  I wish  I had the time and access to a computer but life goes on. I will continue doing the footwork to improve my life and I thank you all again for your support.  Kisses to All!!!!    LOL

      My experience has been that in any group situation, there will be intimidation, aggression, et al. The only course of action besides zero tolerance ( which is unrealistic) is to take it case by case and see if it continues, in which case someone may have to leave the dwelling, or it is managed and the party/parties can admit he/they were wrong and display more acceptable behavior when in similar situations.  In most instances, when there is actual physical contact, immediate expulsion was the case, sometimes for both parties, to insure an atmosphere of approved provoking isn't encouraged. There is a fine line between pointing out unhealthy behaviors and continually taking someones inventory, often to get a rise out of them. ( Not saying that is the case here at all).  I would say that if more than an occassional display of this behavior is seen, that person may not be suited for the particular environment, and should be expelled. We all get angry and react at times, but, if it is a pattern, and we aren't aware of it and trying to change it, we have to go.

      If Doug has to put his crossword puzzle down one more time..........just kidding Doug.  He makes a good point about the aggression. If one is willing to intimidate a 60 year old man, that could be a problem.  Likely, Scott sees his behavior as wrong, and reacted in anger when it was pointed out to him, like most of us used to react with regularity. Self centeredness is the core of our disease. Can you step out of yours for a moment, Scott, and admit you were wrong? You mentioned what the program has taught you. Unless you practice selective learning, surely you would have at least heard something along the lines of admitting our wrongs and making amends.  I think we should back off the "isn't this amusing to watch" message, because it's not. Peoples lives are at stake. This is not what is meant by having fun in recovery. Spending our lives feeling good about ourselves at the expense of others should be an old behavior, not an encouraged new one.  I don't recall it being amusing to the homeowner when anger outbursts occurred at 501 Armstrong, nor should they be at 1016 Madison. If threatening behavior is fun to watch, how thrilling it will be when someone has a black eye. This isn't a reality show, or a video game that we can shut off when we're safe at home.  Let's also not go serious sam, on the other end of the spectrum, but let's at least not voice our amusement at those we are supposed to be helping, they likely don't see the humor in the situation when they are in these behaviors, it will, though be a catalyst for rage, if we aren't careful and mindful of others' positions.

       Appropriately we call this place "The Recovery House"  Every treatment center, halfway house, and any other counseling center that deals with recovery.....stress the importance of maintaining a safe and secure environment.  What is safe and secure?   The lack of fear  of physical or mental intimidation for a start.  This is absolutely the biggest issue and the issue that needs to be resolved without question.  Yet it seems to me we all want to concentrate on the female and her selling her wares.  This problem will take care of itself.  K-9  Katy is already aware of the problem and will likely keep a closer eye on what happens around the house.  This young lady will likely get to spend a little time reflecting and maybe she will pick up and read a copy of the big book in the pokey.     Back to the intimidation - this makes me angry and I don't like feeling this way.  The message we are sending is that this is an  OK  behavior.  WRONG!!  I don't feel that anyone needs to tolerate it. So, I ask, where do we go from here?  Good question.  The ball is in your court Scott.  Unacceptable behavior has occured.  According to the steps, we promptly admit it and clean our side of the fence.  I have seen neither.   It's time to put up - not shut up.

      Silence for a time, then...........BAM!  I have to say, I was amused to picture the girl with 2 1/2 years clean posing and running game on a porch full of addicts, especially Chase, who is a veteran of the ways of the hood. I can picture the look on his face as she explains her position on the food chain. Nice.  The thing I like to ask people who wear crosses is, if Jesus had been stoned to death, would it be neat to wear a boulder around your neck?  Anyway, as Matt touched on, why isn't Scott out saving the lives of men out there? Because using and newcomer women are vulnerable, desperate, and will thrive on any attention given them by a man, especially one who has random amounts of clean time, as the situation calls for. Newcomer? I got like 30 days, I can relate. Old timer? I got like 2 years, I can relate. That, and men dont have breasts.  Dude, you don't have to change your clean time to scam girls, they don't care how long you have, as long as you are paying attention to them.   If you want to help someone, help yourself by working the program, not the ladies. You may even get to the point where you can have meaningful, intimate non-sexual relationships with women. These are the most fulfilling, (most of the time) because you will have learned to communicate with women on a level not befoe possible. You will also be better equipped to be in a physical relationship. Take a look at your past relationships with women, and see how communication was  one of the biggest issues in the way. That, and self-centeredness.  You are not the first or only guy to run this game, bit you also don't have to keep being "that guy".  No matter how you slice it, using addicts and alcoholics are a danger to you and everyone in the house. You can carry the message, not the addict. But first, you have to have a message to share.

      Scott:   I've been watching this stuff for 13 years, and sorry, but if I had to bet on a horse here, Jimmys perspective is right at the finish line, while your pony is being left in the dust.   You keep responding to Jimmy, and some internal issue or trigger that he may have in regards to the situation that you brought into the house.  But while Jimmy may have an emotional reaction to this situation that surpases my reaction.  As to his analysis, and Matts, and Marks, I think they are leaving you in the dust.  YOU DO NOT HAVE TO HELP SOMEONE THAT IS LYING TO YOU.  YOU DO NOT HAVE TO HELP SOMEONE THAT IS USING. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO HELP SOMEONE THAT IS SELFISHLY INTERFERING WITH PEOPLE IN YOUR LIFE AND PEOPLE WHO WERE THERE FOR YOU WHEN YOU HAD NO WHERE TO GO.  The question is:  why would you repay the people who only two weeks before, helped you when no-one else would, by bringing an actively using woman into their home. You are essetially telling them that they have no right to have a place to go that is free of people that are using drugs, and that you have a right to use the house to help people in any way that you judge to be appropriate under the circumstances.  It would be easy for them to say that you are disrespecting them......specifically disrespecting their needs and their right and the treatment that they have EARNED having been their in the house and having not violated the rules in the way that you have.   It is particullary insulting to them that your having allowed someone to violate the rules, you are now adding insult to injury by suggesting that they look at their program.  Admit you are wrong.  Stop trying to get in the last word as to how someone else was also at least a bit wrong, and don't allow any women or men who are still using or drinking to set foot inside the house.  And that may also have to include your ex wife.  I have now met five women in this house as a result of you, which is more than all of the other men combined.  NONE. NONE. NONE.  Were working any kind of a program and all are playing some sort of a game.  You are still attracted to these sort of women.  It is not because you are now St. Francis and want to help them.  It is because you are still looking at things in old ways.   My guess is that you were "trying to help"  these same sort of women, even while you were getting high.  Jimmy:  exceptional comments about the Big Book, rather than the Hotel room.  Scott:  God brought Jimmy into your life, because no-one in the house has a more parallel experience to yours with these kind of women, than Jimmy.   Jimmy has done exactly what you are trying to do and he is right about the results that can be expected and what is the right way to handle it.  You can continue to argue with him.  But my suggestion would be for you to learn from him.  That is just one reason that you ended up here.  Chase     choatic woman into a home, where the people there

      Scott,  I tried to talk to you about this earlier, but no. You don't give a fuck what anyone thinks. Now for a second it will feel like everyone is going to gang up on you, but you will thank us for it later. Trust me because I know from experience. Now I have to bust ylou out.  You talk a good program, but walk straight bullshit. Why? You are not honest. You told us (Chase included), that you had around 30 days clean when you first came tpo this house. Then yesterday you said in front of all uf us that you had near 90 days. You have been here a mere three weeks. So which is it? Then a broad named Pam came here talking about that you wanted her to come here to be your woman. She claimed that she had around two and a half years clean, and boasted that you told her that you hat two years and a couple of months. I find myself wondering if this is working an honest program. We all have carachter defects myself included so I am going to leave yours, and your program alone. But...  Let's leave what that broad said alone, and go just on what you have said about your clean time. Weather  you have 30, 60, or 90 days, have you worked all of the steps, and now on 12? Do you really have a sponser? If so did you talk to him about you having this "S" on your chest, and wanting to save the world? If this wanting to help out a fellow addict is truly valid, why are they only female? No men? After all this is a Mens Recovery House.  You post this program shit, but seeing your behaviors and what has been going on the past few days, it sounds like another plan to manipulate the situation to camoflauge your bull shit. Nice try. Better luck next time. I of all people understand the need for some pussy, but you are going about it the wrong way homie. Be honest. Let everyone know that you are trying to get some gut. Fuck it. By trying to hide behind the program of recovery, and the program of this house, it makes you look like a liar, cheat, and a complete ass hole. Espicially when you acted the way that you did to Jim yesterday, and today.Don't get mad because I threw this out on the table. Everyone was talking about this this agfternoon just as this broad left, and walked over to the crack house.   You're not looking at all of this clearly dogg. There is alot of wisdom around this house, and program. Maybe you should open your eyes, and mind a little. Make a few changes before you get ran through the wringer, again. Can you really afford to learn this lesson the hard way? Maybe you need to think about that for a while.

      Many times when attempting to help an active user we enable them.  As an example giving them a place to stay while there using. It is admirable that Scott was welling to put is sobriety on the line for this girl.  The program has taught me that women must help women not the other way around.  When you’re new into recovery your highest priority must be yourself.  I don’t understand having sex with a using female ever helped her in recovery.   Scott is attempting to be a roster in a hen house and really the past few days have been a futile attempt on his part too helps someone else when indeed he needs to help himself.  If you want to help someone in recovery purchase the Big Book for her rather then a motel room. Talk to her about socializing with other women with long term recovery not with an over sexed male. Suggest to her to seek consoling to determine what is involved in a healthy relationship between a man and a woman.  Being honest with this person as to your real motives may be a good start in your recovery program.  You had another young lady looking for you this afternoon She begin asking questions about you and all of us had a great conversation.  She mentioned that you told her you had two years clean.  This we though was kind of strange because you told members of this house that you had 30 Days. Others have heard you say 90 days.  Gee Scott how many days do you really have clean????

      Thank you Matt for your constructive criticism.  There has been alot of things happening and I truly have mixed emotions and thoughts about this person and they are affecting my emotions and recovery.  As far as people, places, and things, there is one thing I have to keep up front is that I am powerless, but sometimes I want to be in power and want the best for this addict and all addicts.  Although things have been calm and peaceful when I first came in, I still have my character defects and am actively working on them.  As far as me and Jim's altercation I think there is a deeper issue with Jim besides this person being in or at the house and he would be open minded and willing to face his fears regarding this type of addict he could stop running from his own sick thoughts and ask God to help him remove these character defects. And maybe some of this turmoil could have been avoided.  If a person is truly working a 12 step program with the help of his higher power then this person can accept and deal with on a spiritual basis someone in active addiction.

      In reading Scott's post, I would like perspective on whether Scott is:  1.  Legitimately 12 Stepping;  or  2.  13 Stepping with a Biblical Twist.  Rather than make up my mind right now, I think it would be much more interesting and entertaining, to hear from you and Scott again.  And for reference, the Bible actually judges conduct and calls upon it readers to judge their own conduct and the conduct of others according to the same standards as the Bible.    I mean Scott, if we are not to judge anyone or anything, then it is kind of stupid for us as a Recovery House to have any rules...........if we can't then judge someone as having violated them, or as being appropriate or inappropriate for the Recovery House program.  The only people who use "judgment" the way you have, are at that place, where they are ironically conflicted between saying, "...you don't have a right to judge..."  and "...I don't care what you think anyway..."  What is obvious to everyone is that we ABSOLUTELY have a right to judge what is right and wrong and judge how it affects us, and what we are willing to put up with or not put up with.   It is also obvious that you are deeply conflicted, in that you know that people are exercising their God given RESPONSIBILITY to judge appropriately and that you and the people that you are still associating with.....are not measuring up........  You obviously do care very much what people think about you, so much in fact that you take a physically aggressive posture and body language when YOU JUDGE someones expressions as something that you do not want to hear.  We all have an emotional and a rational side.  The emotional side desires to be right even when we are wrong and is threatened by others' contrary emotions, but is even more threatened by others contrary logic - rational.     Clearly from the last few days, it is not possible for Scott to be rational in regards to someone with whom he has had an emotional connection.   Any AA sponsor is going to tell you that someone with whom you are on such an emotional level with - at this point in your recovery, you need to stay as far away from them as posibily, until you can deal with them 100% rationally and cannot be manipulated into enabling them and being unfair to the people that live around you.  Yes, Matt has in the past received the "Butthead of the Week" award.    I really cannot see how you [Scott] are going to avoid nomination for that award, this coming Friday.   The one thing that I have noticed about Recovery House, is that when one participant is putting forth such effort to achieve this award, the others in the house, seem more than happy to let the guy have it and in fact seem to treat the rest of each other exceptionally well.  So in that sense Scott, I and the others owe you a debt of our gratitude.  Chase

      This afternoon, myself, Jim, Matt and Mark observed a female exit a full size pickup and wander over to the porch.  I asked if we could help her and she asked for Scott.  I told her that he was at work, and she said that he had called her in Bloomington and that her uncle had just dropped her off.   She claimed to be an old friend of Scotts, and claimed 2.5 years of sobriety.  She was obviously intelligent, educated and was every bit attractive enough to keep busy 24/7 on Madison Avenue.  Unfortunately that is Madison Avenue in Peoria, not New York, which means that she is not a banker, but rather a recipient of other types of deposits, which our blind resident with an enhanced sense of smell noted, were still on her breath.  As all women, she too seemed quite facinated by the blind man and could not resist cozying up to him.   And the blind man definitely seemed to enjoy toying with this wretch.  I later spoke to Stan, who was aware of this woman's presence on the street the other night, and said that she had approached Scott with the request that he find her a good man.  Is it not interesting the subtle ways these working girls apply their solicitations.   She was either looking for Scott to step up and be that five minute wonder or perhaps hoping that he [Scott] would be willing [for a small fee of course...]  assist her in finding a regular supply of not just a single good man, but probably MORE than just a few "good men".  Also noted, was that she was wearing a gold cross.  Just last night, I was asking Scott, how many more female surprises we were going to have popping up in the days ahead.  Jim and Matt, your blogs are specifically noted, but I don't think that we have any reason to think that either of you or anyone else in the house is going to relapse over any of this.  I will guarantee you that we are all going to enjoy the show, and see how Scott muddles through his chaos.  As I blogged the other day, our goal is to enjoy [like watching the show "COPS" ] observing someone elses dysfunctional chaos, and especially watching their excuses and rationalizations.    Scott has thrown out their, his position that he is morally obligated to help this person.  The problem obviously is that he is not capable of helping them, and is only enabling them to continue their riduculous behavior.   We can all have a good time laughing at Scott and "telling" him that his rationalizing some obligation in this regard is wrong, but ultimately it will not be our wise words of counsel and experience {which each one of us has done......with women....more than once.....} but rather the same thing that changed our minds....the sheer frustration of not having ANY success.    My understanding of the story is that the first Scott babe had two weeks clean and sober, until she hooked up with Scott.  Then BOOM, Scott gets involved and she is out that night.  I think a reasonable person would think that perhaps Scott is not the "physician" that she needs.  But he wants to play recovery Dr. for her, and she is more than willing to tango, so LET HER TEACH HIM WHAT HE WILL NOT HEAR FROM US.  I hope that Scott realizes that as soon as he lets this person go and leaves them up to God.......Scott will see the return of his serenity and I know that all of you, Victor and Stan included will be happy to have Scott join you in a hearty laugh over Scott's behavior this last week.    There is a lot of wisdom in this Tribe, and Scott would be wise to listen to it, rather than getting angry.  Please leave a copy of this message in Scott's room, and hopefully he will be able to sleep on it and have a better perspective in the morning.  Even with all of this chaos, there is no excuse for you or for Scott to relapse.   This is kids stuff.  And boy are kids, fun to watch!  Chase Ingersoll

      Program Participant Rules  NO VIOLENCE OR THREATS:  I will not behave in a threatening or violent manner on the premises, or to any participant.     A member of our house newly into recover took it upon him self to invite a girl into this house without consulting the board or more importantly the house members as a group. At the previous weekly house meeting this procedure was discussed and agreed upon.   This young lady left several times during the evening dressed very indecently and finally returned early the next morning and was allowed by Mr. Scott to sleep on the floor inside the recover house residence.  She admitted to using crack cocaine and was associating with dubious people.  It is the responsibility of the house member to properly supervise his guest while at the recovery house.  He did not consider the other people in this house with respect to their feelings and the safe sobriety environment that we enjoy at recovery house.  He by allowing someone who was using drugs to stay or even be on the house grounds is inconsiderate and unacceptable.   I personally find it strange that so much thought has been given this young lady who is a active user and not Scott who has violated house procedures and rules.  Previously Scott allegedly spent a night with his friend outside this house and did not inform anyone that he wouldn’t be coming home, which is another violation of home procedures.  I also in my opinion think that there is much more to this story about Scott’s association with this girl that he is not telling us.  Some may say this is his personal life and it is his not our business but I contend that when his inappropriate behavior affects members of this house it becomes our business.  When a recovering person associates with an active drug user he or she places themselves in a dangerous position and possibility losing focus with respect to their own sobriety.  When one of our house members reacts in this way it is our responsibility to bring this issue to the surface and confront the individual in question about being honest and sympathetic.

      To whom this may concern-maybe my outlook on recovery or helping another suffering addict-male or female is different.  What this program has taught and FREELY given me is to reach out and help someone that has lost hope in a world that has people that clearly feel "LITTLE you and BIG I". No matter what the situation may be or what your addiction was i.e. the lady selling her body for drugs to the men that are called tricks that drive up and down the street that support their addiction, or the person who eats too much, the person who gambles too much, it's all addiction, sick behavior and wrong. And most of us live with these dark secrets that fester, but with God's Grace you've been able to obstain and realize that there is a better way of life. You have asked your Higher Power for help and work the 12 steps of recovery. You've changed your life and help other suffering people. You don't judge. You don't judge by the color of skin, how many times incarcerated, how many times molested when a child, or how short my skirt is.  You don't jusdge what is appropriate or not appropriate for me.  To accept people, places and things for what they are and no matter what that person does, as long as I've done the best of my ability and resources to help.  To do God's Will to help save someone's life and maybe make a difference, and after that the rest is up to them. Then I can sleep at night knowing I did my part.

      Better? Peoria Recovery House. Because being drunk, high, and disfunctional is no way to live life.  You must have been in your poop stained briefs again. Ha, ha.  Yes, Thanks to Jim, I am back on line, and better than ever....  I apoligize for my absense yesterday at the house meeting. Though it was thought that I was not at the house, I assure that I was here. I was sick in my room sleeping. I didn't go to church, or boating with my sponser as I origianally had planned.  I find myself wondering what the hell is going on around here. Last week it was the Matt, and Jim show. This week Scott? In the past I found that Jim often got carried away with his assumptions, and with the way he reacted, but is that the case this time?  Coming to the defense of the rat... What happened yesterday morning with the presence of physical aggression, I did not see obviously. However I heard it. No matter what the circumstances at no time is physical aggression understood, or tolerated. This is a major violation of the house rules, and should be taken seriously with respects in the current residency of the aggressor. One of the main goals of the recovery house is to provide a safe, clean, and sobor environment to all who resides here. Has this been violated? I guess that this is up to Jim who in this case was the one who was the intimidatee. Now, I do not know if this so called "beef" was quarshed yesterday or not, maybe you could answer that Chase, but from what I heard today, it has not been. It seems as if Scott keeps pushing the issue.  I totally understand wanting to help out a fellow addict despite the gender of that addict, but one thing needs to be taken into consideration. The addict that Scott is wanting to "help" is still using. I was told that Chase distributed a hard copy of the New, and improved rules yesterday in the house meeting. If they are the same rules that I was sent via e- mail then Scott violated these rules not even 24 hours after they were handed out, and posted. At no point in time is a person activly usingg allowed to be in this house, or on this property. Guess who was here today?  This is blatent disregard for the rules of the house. What Scott is not seeing is that he is not just enableing his friend, but possibly setting himself, and other house members up for relapse, and a possible much deeper consequenses.  I like Scott, but I wonder what is really going on between his ears. THe Scott that we knew, and the Scott that has been the last couple of days is not the same guy.

          You will now see the following slogan posted on the website.  I think it is appropriate.  If anyone wants a t-shirt, I can get the iron on paper to Jimmy and you can print them out and iron them on to any shirt.         RECOVERY HOUSE

       1.    Guests:   if you want to have a guest - plan ahead and bring it up at the Sunday meeting so that everyone can be given your polite consideration.  To spring a "guest" on your roommates - can be just plain inconsiderate and can create a lot of chaos in the house and in your life, that you and no-one else needs.   There is the easy way to do things and the hard way.  The way this was done this weekend, was the hard way.  Also:  the women's house is up and running.  Obviously, thzt is where femaile guests should go.   2. Fighting and Biting:    People will cause problems, be jerks and relapse.  So why are the people who stayed sober, at such odds against each other.  Your loyalty to and unity with, must be to the person who is remaining sober and that loyalty must be greater than any to any past friend or family member who is either not an appropriate person for you to live with, or who believes that you are not good enough to live with them.     Your "real" family is those people who live around you and who are showing you in daily interaction that despite all of their abnoxious character defects and insulting ways of treating you........that despite that, there is no excuse for their not remaining clean and sober, and that accordingly there is absolutely no reason that a far better person such as yourself (and each of you can assume that I am talking about you) cannot remain clean and sober also.   3.  Two on one can have some fun ........One on one is no fun at all.  THe prinicipal here is that you do not go out 12th Stepping alone.  Recovery is no good alone and helping other has a lot of hazzards when you do it alone.  Get a buddy, and/or the whole house involved and you will have a better outcome and a lot more fun.  Chaos is not fun to be involved in, but from a safe distance it can be fun to watch.   Kind of like a NASCAR wreck, or a Hockey Fight.   4.  Provisions:   get it set up to plug the new people into the food pantries, Share Food and link card if necessary.  It is on one hand, commendable that you all have been helping each and every knew person in every way that you can.  But we need to be showing them how to help themselves, as you all have other responsibilities and commitments may have a first claim on your limited time and resources.  Provisions also applies to the other than food basics that a person coming in from the mission might need.  I will be trying to get people more organized as far as helping the new guys to hit the ground running in regards to improvements around the house and preparing a room for themselves and the next guy.  I am just developing this, so it is a work in progress.   5.  Jobs:    you are all especially helping each other with transportation and this also deserves commendation.  It looks like all of the men are going to be working come Monday.  I know that the hardest situation for a man, is when he does not have a job and every day is a Saturday.  It is commendable that those of you who have been in this situtation have been patient, albeit obviously frustrated, but that you did not relapse or get pn other people about anything.  Good job  and this person is an excellent example of how to get through such frustrations.   For the addict, frustrations will often be a marathon where the goal is just to finish, rather than to set a world record as far as what we were able to accomplish on our down time.   6.  Heart in the right place  - mind still learning discretion is the better part of caring.   7.  Meetings:   get to more than one meeting a week.  90 in 90 is a suggested application of your commitment to the program and people in it.  Yes, that may be hard, but you need to do more than one meeting a week.  It will accelerate your recovery, make it easier for the people around you, and enable you to learn much wisdom which you may depart to your dysfunctional, controling parents.  Not that I know that anyone has controlling or dysfunctional parents.  Actually many of you are/were dysfunctional, controling parents yourselves and you exhibit those characteristic in the house all too frequently.   8.  Dining room table:   obviously a work in progress, but this week we made some progress.  Start beging for chairs.   9.  Officer Handing  is very aware of the two recovery houses in the neighborhood and is telling people that are out there about it.  She is especially concerned about the people who are strings of clean and sober days and weeks, while still being on the street or in other unfortunate situation, and she will be letting them know that we are available and interested in making a place for people who are willing to get on board.  Please stress to anyone that comes over to the house, that we are on a first name basis with K9 Katie and that she drops by frequently.   10. If you are going to be out after midnight , please call - or put in on the board, when we get one up.   11.  BENDING THE RULES:   The Recovery House Rules are there to protect you and enable you to get along with each other.  If we need flexibility or a bending of the rules, get a hold of me and let me make that call.   If you do it, you are going to be accountable to the people that live across the hall from you, and that SUCKS...for you!!    If I bend a rule for some reason, I take the heat, not you, so you can be having good times with the guy across the hall from you.   12.  Disrespect:    Disrespect is a nebulous, overused term.   Everyone of us as addicts and alcoholics is guilty of disrespect if not out and out dishonor to our families, friends, communities and most importantly, Disrespect to GOD, each and every time that we gave Him the finger and went our own way.   Keep that in perspective when someone is rude to you, or criticizes you.  If they are rude, it is not because they intended to "dis" you, it is probably just that they are self absorbed, or ignorant as to how their behavior looks to other people.  If they criticize you, it is because they respect you enough to think that you are a wise person who will listen to another person's opinion and strong enough to take it for what it is worth.  I'm sure that I have left something off here......Jim?  Oh yes.........as I have mentioned to a couple of you, Jim is going to be moving up to some digs that will better suit his Ham Radio reception and a new business venture.  Having been in Jim's situation before with several, just out of treatment recovery guys in my house at one time, I completely understand the stress of on one hand being responsible for what happens with the guys, but on the other hand trying to keep your hands off, even while guys are dragging you into their little chaotic dramas.   As in most cases like this, you will not know how much you will miss him, until he no longer there every morning and every night.   His departure with necessitate more involvement on my part and more structure and organization.   You will all have to step up, lead by example and learn how to tactfully confront people.      Jim:  Please print and post this on the refrigerator.  I need everyone to read it and discuss it until they are ready to move on to other topics.  Chase Ingersoll

      I continue to admit my defects of character, you continue to point them out.  We started by discussing watching BET, now we are discussing how disgusting my behavior is.  I take a look at my stuff, you take another look at my stuff, instead of yours. (oh, you have some)  I submit the proverbial olive branch, you submit a chainsaw.  Isn't the idea of communication that it is 2 (or more) sided, not just 1?  You can't be right 100% of the time, at least that's what I have heard in meetings.

      I find that when people don't have a leg to stand on in regards to facts or logic,  they generally play it one of the two following ways:  1.  They try and change the subject to a different issue, as in this case, where they still have to address the issue as to how Vulgar Rap music is consistent with the recovery atmosphere.  I'm still waiting:  HOW IS RAP MUSIC CONSISTENT WITH THE IMAGE THE RECOVERY HOUSE IMAGE?  2.  They just call you an asshole, even when if they bothered to ask any of the people who they live with, they would find that there is pretty much a consensus that THEY are the most inconsiderate person in the house.  3.  Specific to the Recovery community, they like to make out that they have never seen anyone with that degree of recovery take sucha position or behave such a way.    What is clear, is that one person here has a higher sense of responsibility, while the other two have a higher sense of entitlement to do whatever they feel like doing regardless of how that activity might affect others.   And you still don't want to discuss your choices negative affects on specific individuals and the house as a whole.  Grow up kids!  Chase Ingersoll

      I totally disagree with that statement. In my opinion biting the hand that feeds me would be....  Remember that day when those people from placement services(IDOC) came here. Do you remember them asking me how long I had been here, and how it was going? Do you remember the two weeks before that day, and how you treated me? You cannot deny it because there are months of blogs to back this claim entirely.. Maybe you would like to take a minute to review. Regardless of how much I hated your guts, I appreciated that you let me live here with the circumstances of my financial situation. Weather you know it or not, I still am. Every staff in IDOC knows who I am. They know what happend to me, and where I came from. They all know the people in DOC that witnessed the Matt Yeater that came in to prison, and the Matt Yeater that came out. They know that they are two different people. When I first went inn they never would listen to a thing that I said, when I left they would take me outside to smoke a cigarette while we carried on a conversation. You may not want to believe this, but I am going to put it out there. If I wanted to bite the hand that fed me, I would have done it then. No, I didn't. I lied to those guys.  When they asked how things were going, I responded with "Honestly?". I heard your heart jump into your throat. It was just two days before then when you got in my face and challenged me. Do you remember? Yes, you remember. Despite all of that bull shit that went on that night, and the week before when you acted like a complete asshole when that refridgeerator door fell on my foot, I told them that things were fine. Why? I knew what you were attempting to do as far as that contract is concerned, and I was completely greatful for you allowing me to stay here. I could have asked them to have a seat, and told them of the shit that really went on here, but I didn't. Why? That would have been biting the hand that fed me.  I can sit here and think of all kinds of spiteful ways to "Bite the hand that feeds me", but I am not going to waste that time. I am not going to waste that time because I am not that kind of person today because of this program. I don't have to run around and fuck the person that has done wrong to me. Don't get me wrong, I will defend myself, but just because he said this, I don't have to say that.  I understand your position on the blasting of the music. No one planned to. What was being argued was the fact of King Chase coming into our home, and saying that we couldn't watch B.E.T. A channel that edits all of which music it plays. That is all, but you took it to a whole different level.  You speak of serenity, and how much you supposedly have. You speak of being at our grandmothers and blasting this music. I took offense to that. Who the fuck are you to make an assumption like that about me. How do you come up with all of this horse shit. Do you discuss all of this shit with your sponser? I am certain that you do not. Iff you did, if he was any type of a decent sponser at all, he would stop you from making an ass out of yourself. I cannot believe some of the things that you say.  You need to back up the truck, and take a good look at yourself. You won't though. You have a wife, home, truck, rental properties, and a heart that wants to help. You are on top of the world. A God fearing man with a boatload of morals.. There is nothing wrong with attempting to push some of those morals off on your fellow man. But that is the problem. You do not make us feel like you feel like we are your fellow. Most people feel like you look down on the rest of us. Maybe not everyone in the world, just the ones that came from a wrecked back ground, and now experiencing the consequenses of which we were raised, and have lived. There are two people that I know that says that you can do no wrong. The rest of the people that I know (many in Peoria)  that has not one good thing to say about Chase Ingersoll. Not all of them are in the recovery program. Most people deal with it accepting the carachter defect of arrogance. Then there are people like me that deal with it long enough to get to know them, then try to show them their own shit to let them know that it stinks too.  Maybe I am wrong for that, but my dad taught me a couple of things that stuck with me. "Treat people the way that you want to be treated." I think that I do. So when you feel like that I need to be called on my bullshit let me know. I appreciate it, and will look at my behavior, and do the best to change it.  There is not one person one the face of this earth that has not messed up at one time or another. We all have. Even you Chase. My mistake was getting involved with drugs. As a result, I am a drug addict who lost his vision, and chased the dope all the way into the penial system. I must live with the decisions that I made in my life. The only difference between two and half years ago, and now is that I have been sober enough to know that I have a choice to stay sober, and live a life as a free man, or get high and go back to prison, or possibly die. I choose to stay sober one day at a time. I have to ask myself one question though. Is listening to 50 cent rap about cell phones, and bullet proof vest going to trigger a relapse. No, it wont. Do I live in a house where someone may not want to hear that? Yes, I do. Do I need to respect that? Yes, I do. Will I? Yes, I will. But when no one is home will I blast the T.V. and shake my ass in the middle of the living room like I was auditioning for a Ludachrist video? Yes, I will.

      .. I've got more facts, more resources, more perspective, more recovery, and more self-discipline......and I am taking my ball and going home.  I have never heard anyone with quality recovery say anything like this. Show me in the Big Book or any other piece of recovery literature where it says that how much I have and how much I do for others by saying so is the means by which you should measure my recovery.  I am grateful and I realize the level of effort you put into helping others. All  am saying is Live and Let Live. Maybe you have seen that little slogan hanging around at Beewolf. Don't take yourself so seriously, it's ok. We love you for the person you are, and I mean that sincerely.

      Interesting observations:  1.  Nice to see you co-signing Matt's bullshit;  2.  I see that you both feel that it is perfectly okay to bite the hand that feeds you;  Most interesting in regards to the television in that both of you did not contribute a dime to its being there, but none-the-less feel completely entiled to use in in any, offensive or obnoxious way that you desire.  Try growing up a little, actually putting YOUR money where your mouth is, and see if your are not just a little resentful at people who can be absolutely oblivious to the fact that other people live, work and volunteer their time in the same place and find your particular form of entertainment to be disgusting, unhealthy and contrary to the healthy atmosphere that you are trying to create and make comfortable for as many people as possible.  By all means, keep posting your heart felt ingratitude, so that others might perhaps appropriately guard themselves and apply a more protective boundary in their relationships with you.  I'll be waiting on pins and needles to see who else is interested in cosigning your bullshit.  Some of us are actually serious about the common areas of the house being a pleasant and wholesome environment for every person that might come through the door, rather than bringing in behaviors and thoughts that we said we were going to leave out in the street.  But my guess is that both of you probably treated your own families far worse and would have had no compunction, blasting that sort of music in your grandmothers house in the middle of the day, regardless of how it would make her or her neighbors feel.   So can we really expect you to treat myself or anyone else any better?  Here is the deal.    You want to argue with Chase, you better be right.   I will not back off on a principal, especially when people are willing to make such entertaining fools of themselves trying to support an untenable position.   And in this argument, I've got more facts, more  perspective, more support, more recovery and more self discipline in my little finger than both your bodies combined.  So until you can defend the Lil Kim lyrics as somehow unoffensive to Blacks, Women and not something you would want your child to hear, please don't blast that sort of crap in the common area of the house.

      ........and get to the meat.  Shakespeare said, " All the world's a stage, all the men and women are merely players." He forgot to mention that I was the chief critic. I was always able to see the flaw in every person, every situation. And I was always glad to point it out, because I knew you wanted perfection, just as I did. AA and acceptance have taught me that there is a bit of good in the worst of us, and a bit of bad in the best of us; that we are all children of God, and we all have a right to be here. When I complain about me or you, I am complaining about God's handiwork. I am saying that I know better than God.  For years, I was sure that the worst thing that could happento a nice guy like me wouldbe that I would turn out to be an alcoholic. Today, I find that it is the best thing to ever happen to me. This proves I don't know what's good for me. And if I don't know what's good for me, then I don't know what's good or bad for anyone.  So I am better off if I don't give advice, don't figure I know what's best, and just accept life on life's terms, as it is today--especially my own life, as it actually is. Before AA,  I judged myself by my intentions, while the world was judging me by my actions.--Big Book, 3rd ed. ppg 449-450.  When I am disturbed, it is  because I find some person, place, thing, or situation-some fact of my life- unacceptable to me, and I can find no serenity until I accept that person, place, thing or situation as being exactly the way it is supposed to be at this moment. ........I need to concentrate not so much much on what needs to be changed in the world as on what needs to be changed in me and in my attitudes. --Big Book 3rd ed. p 449.  You will be most successful with alcoholics if you do not exhibit any pasion for crusade or reform. Never talk down to an alcoholic from a moral or spiritual hilltop; simply lay out the kit kit of spiritual tools for his inspection. Show him how they worked for you. Offer him friendship and fellowship. Tell him that if he wants to get well, you will do anyting to help. Big Book 3rd ed. p 95  This says to me, that I must accept life on life's terms, making changes in ME first, strive for humility, and a spirit of love for others.  For example, if I am not where you are, it is not your job to make sure I want to be you, or for you to take hostages on a trip to BELIKEME. I have many friends who (including myself) have many character defects. What works best for us is to love each other until we can love ourselves, despite our flaws. We can point them out to each other, when we can, in a way that is not condascending or based on our personal opinions.  This BET issue is a perfect example of the struggle to be right, when we forget that things work out the way they are supposed to, when we are open minded and accepting.

      You have helped me more than you know. I have so much appreciation for you that I cannot even begin to explain it. Your reasoning, and analogies are often logical, and helpful. However there are time that you are just plain full of shit. Your justification of not allowing the occupants of the recovery houses  to listen to what they wish on the first floor because they may want to decorate the that area with what ever decor they wish (refering to the two live crew poster)), is just plain nonsense. Give us a break...

      Art forms are very much of a reflection of the mindset, character and education of the patron.   Sorry, but I've seen the screwed up minds and lives that are into ghetto rap and pop music in general.  The difficulty is that the first floor is a common area.   The music should never be so loud as to vibrate the furniture or prohibit a talking voice.  Further, if we adopt the "anyone can listen to anything they want" attitude,  that can easily transpose itself into "anyone can decorate the first floor any way that they want to"  and for example someone could think nothing of posting a 2-Live Crew poster in the kitchen.  What I think you are missing is that 1016 Madison was selected very much for the class and sophitication that was built into the house and the same way certain types of people are going to find themselves incongruous with the occupants of the property, certain tastes and forms of behavior are going to lack harmony within those walls.  And I have yet to have anyone provide me with the harmonious perspective of Lil' Kims lyrics and the 12 Step Principals.  Further, it is just plain ridiculous for us to allow "niggar" and "bitches" to be blasted around the house.  If you want to hear that, put on your headphones, but don't run every polite, person with a little bit of class, out of what should be a space that you share.  Chase Ingersoll

      (I pray for love... I pray for love... I pray for love, joy, peace and happiness)Every day... and every nightMm-mm, not I, one nigga's in my eye(I pray for love... I pray for love... I pray for love, joy, peace and happiness) Every day, yo... every night.........  These are Lil Kim lyrics as well. It depends on what you look for and what you hear. As Individuals, we are going to relate to different things, from different sources. What one might hear as appalling, another may hear as soothing.  Music is an artform, and, just like all other forms of art, there are controversial pieces. Everything is not for everyone. There are mediums through which some can relate and reflect, while others will mock what they don't understand. The fact that something looks or sounds wrong to one, means nothing more than it is not for that person.  If it were up to one or a few individuals to determine what is best for everyone, we wouldnt have books,(ala Hitler), or integration(ala the South).

      Have you ever came here, and heard that type of music on the stereo with the people present that you mentioned below? No, you have not. Nor will you ever. I understand your concerns with that type of music playing in the company of guest of that nature, but why does it matter what is being played when no one is around?  It's entertainment. That is all. No one is going to listen to a LiL' Kim song then run to the kitchen to attempt to make a Sprite can disappear in their mouth, nor will they listen to Brooks and Dunn then get up and attempt to do the "Boot Scoot Boogie" right there in the living room.  It's just not going to happen.  So what's the big deal. Some what of a comprimise should be made. This type of unruly power struggle is nothing more than another brick in the wall of reasons why people don't want to spread positive messages about this place.  Rob,  Thanks for the helpful advise. Yes, I did get the web adress, but Jim took it upon his self to make a copy of it (The Big Book) and put it on disc for me. Thanks Jim.  Did you receive my e- mail about the lady that needed some work done? You never got back to me on that.

        Here is an example of a well known rap artist that is often played on BET and MTV.   Obviously some of you have just never bothered to consider what is actually being said.    Since Matt stuck his neck out on the issue, regardless of how smart he is, I think it is going to take all of your brains together to explain how you would share the downstairs of 1016 NE Madison with guests, women, children and prospective residents, and 12 Step supporters, with the following "music" coming from the stero speakers on the television.  I am perfectly open to being persuaded, as to how the message of this music is congruent with the morals and values of anyone's 12 Step program.   I'll be waiting to see who besides Matt is willing to make a fool of themselves on this issue.   Lil' Kim Player Haters    Sound of people talking in background*  Hater #1: Hey yo Hater #2: Whatup, baby? Hater #1: That little stink ass bitch, Kim, them little snake          niggaz, man, I don't like that bitch          I can't stand that bitch Hater #2: Yeah, I see that bitch Hater #1: That's my word yo, that's my word, son          But yo, on the real though, the bitch do be havin          some cheddah and the bitch be rockin some ice          Know what I'm sayin? Hater #2: I'm sayin, I see it Hater #1: I be seein her floatin with little niggaz here now          and then, know what I'm sayin? Hater #2: What, them little bitch ass M.A.F.I.A. niggaz? Hater #1: Yeah, them little faggot ass niggaz Hater #2: Them niggaz pussy, kid Hater #1: I swear to God, if I ever see them niggaz rollin down          Gates Avenue I'm gonna lay one of em on the strength          You know what I'm sayin, you know how we roll baby Hater #2: No doubt Hater #1: But, am, yo what's up, you wanna get this paper or what? Hater #2: No doubt Hater #1: Cause they, I'm sayin, I know they sweet          You know what I'm sayin? You know how they get down          Know what I'm sayin? Hater #2: No doubt Hater #1: I'ma hold them niggaz down, one a them niggaz move a          inch, I'm lacin em straight up and down, I'm puttin one in          they cabbage Hater #2: No doubt let's make it happen, kid Hater #1: Aight

      That was a lot of stuff in a short time. You guys must have been storing it up. Haven't heard from whoever is working at 1214.  Does anyone know who this is? I would like to personally thank you.  Matt did you get the link to check out the Big Book on CD?  As far as I know, this is a democratic house? So, the issues such as television programming shouldn't be an issue if the house collectively votes and is aware of the pro's and con's of the matter at hand. Obvoiusly,  X-rated movies are probably going to fall into the non-votable category, but normal cable channels should be up to residents. If I don't like BET, I can go to a meeting, for a walk, to my room, work on my steps, ad infinitum.  What you said about choosing what is best for us is true, Matt, but you might also consider that we don't always know what's best for us, or we wouldn't be where we are. Being open-minded to others' suggestions is the best route for me. I might not like it, or agree, but I can take an honest look at it, and decide for myself, HONESTLY.  Some of those with many 24 hours sober may try to suggest things based on what worked for them, or based on their opinion. Take a look at everything people say to you and bounce it off those you trust are working a good program.  Everyone that is sober or clean is not necessarily in recovery, and their behaviors havent really changed, as much as their circumstances have. You will be able to detect these people, if you already haven't, based on their ability to listen and humbly accept opposition occassionally from others. Someone who has truly surrendered to this way of life will be visible by their actions. None of us are perfect, but it is apparent who is becoming a humble, open minded, honest person, and who is a self-righteous, opinionated, word twister.  I'm sure you hear these people at meetings.  You needn't expend the energy required to combat this type of behavior, should you come across it,  just accept it, pray for them, and talk to those you trust.

      Other notes on the house meeting:  THe only person that was against the Rap station on the T.V. was Sir Chase. He claimed that he felt as though it was offensive, and that it should not be played on the T.V. As so that I doo not mis quote anyone, I will leave room for him to comment on this issue.  Classical music: Could be considered as a direct gift from God to some people. TO other people, complete waste of time that the composer could have spent polishing his 24 inch crome rims.. Cal ming, and soothing to some people. To others one more minute of listening to this crap could be a logical reason to commit suicide. SOme people claim that classical music helps with the devolopment of the brains of infants. To others it could be the reason that that infant is slamming his/ or her head off of the floor.  Rock/ heavy metal:: Well I was intending to go through all types of music and pull positive and negitive points out for each area of interest, but that would take more time than I am willing to spend on this topic. My point is that with all types of entertainment there are going to be both positive, and negative views on that specific topic. That goes with M.T.V., C.M.T., Rated R films, to simple cartoons. So why is B.E.T. being targeted?  I understand why we have the rules that we do, but I cannot understand your reasoning for this nonsense on B.E.T. Something that you may want to consider, You are the land lord. You do not live here. You are the only one that brought up your dislike of B.E.T. and that it should not be played. How are you going to push your dislikes off on everyone in this house. We are not here to be converted into the next Mozart, but a clean and sober person. Is music going to affect that? You might say yes, but we say no. We as residents ask that you keep your likes, and dislikes at your house, and we'll keep ours at ours. B.E.T. hasn't been an issue thus far, but when it is we'll blog you...

      It looks as though the regular Recovery House meeting will be Sunday at 5:00 pm, at 1016 NE Madison.  Some topics:     Telephone:  there is no black letter rule other than trying to be considerate of others.  This is a problem in my house.  When more than a couple of people are sharing a telephone, it will be a pain in the ass.   You will miss messages.  IF YOU ARE EXPECTING A CALL FROM A JOB - YOU CALL THEM.  DON'T WAIT FOR THEM TO CALL YOU AND RISK LOOSING A MESSAGE.  We are going to work on an internet voicemail message service so that every participant has their own voicemail messages which they will receive via email.   Cleanup:    If you leave a dish in the sink, it becomes very likely that the next guy will be inclined to leave one also and shortly thereafter there will be one pissed off  guy at the sink doing all the dishes, while the others stand around with their thumbs up their butts and crumbs on their faces, denying that they have eaten anything for the last two days.   Laund   ry:    Bob donated a washer and dryer.  The drain needs to be unclogged and I will have the 220 outlet up and working by the end of the day.   Computer:   the wireless router is functioning and the house computer should be up and running shortly.  It will be located in the foyer so as to be available to everyone and so as to function as a natural filter for anyone tempted with an obsession for pornography.   Jim and John will be putting together a computer curriculum and running a couple of classes at the house.    Talk and confidentiality:   Gotta be careful what you say and who you say it to.  Again, there is no rule, but we all know how people out there will twist what we say about someone.  My suggestion is to expect it to happen to you, so be prepared for it and put on an emotional umbrella.  I've been taking people into my home for years, and I don't know a one, that has never gone down the street, into meetings, etc. and not made fair game of everything that went on in my house.   But typically, there are enough other people around to set the record strait on rumors that get too out of hand.     Women's Recovery House:   MEN ARE NOT ALLOWED.   There are just too many issues and hazzards for men and women early in recovery, and those of us who could handle going over to the women's house,  need to not do it so as to reinforce this policy/principle for the horny little goofballs among us, that would want to go over their to just "hang out" .  The girls are welcome to "hang out" on the first floor of 1016, but they do not need to go upstairs and they are obviously free to use their discretion  if some guy is being pig headed, and escape back to the comfort and safety of the GALS ONLY ABODE.   The one exception is when accompanied by a board member as in the case where testosterone loaded bulk is needed to move furniture.  Obviously, those of you who have family members or friends of another gender.  If their behavior is kosher, the girls can stay at the women's and the male relatives would be welcome at the men's house......within reason.   Rules for women's recovery house are otherwise the same as the men's.   New People:   we need to be making provisions for new participants, many of whom are going to arrive without so much as a washrag or can of soup.    Exercise Equipment:    we are looking at putting that in the basement with an additional  television.  That would also be available to the women, along with the laundry in teh basement.   Dining Room:   be on the lookout for dining room chairs.  We need at least a dozen.  I will be getting a table top this week.  Chase Ingersoll

      Irrational thoughts of our feelings play a major role in this behavior. We as human beings need to feel good all the time, but this is an irrational thought process. Irrational thought process leads to relapse and continued use of drugs.  The four main feelings are Comfort,  Fairness, Approval and Success. We as human beings all have these feelings.  Some of us have irrational thoughts with respect to these feelings. Failure to satisfy these feelings  promotes anger and frustration that may lead to alcohol or drug use. The problem here is to rationally deal in a positive way with these thoughts with respect to these feelings. One-way to deal with this problem is to develop rational ways of thinking about these feelings. As an example If we feel discomfort we can learn to deal with it in the short term, realizing that it would be better to feel a little discomfort for a short term rather then to experience pain and suffering in the long term. We can tolerate discomfort because of the consequences that would occur in the long term as a result of using drugs. We can tolerate this discomfort because it’s not horrible or terrible. Sobriety is in our long term best interest because of the pain we will experience by using. It is irrational that we must have comfort, fairness, approval and success all the time. We must realize the world we live is not fair and we don’t need approval to be happy. It is also irrational to believe  that we always need success to function as a well-adjusted human being. For people like us think that when we are uncomfortable we need relief right now  We must stop and think what the consequences are if we act on these feelings in an irrational way. Acting on these irrational feelings will not be in our best long-term interest.

      I know Carl Cannon, and Jimmy Graham. Graham left the Peoria Public Housing for the Warden's position mid- April of 04 in the Peoria Adult Transition Center, believe me, I know first hand that he means business. Carl, on the other hand, I know from speaking with him side by side with him on the Choices Youth Outreach Program, and over the past year have become friends.  Needing some inside help?

      Chase,              I wasn’t calling the lack of performance disrespect. I was saying that when Mark comes home from work, and goes to prepare his lunch for the next day, and finds that someone has been maxing his shit all that day. Now Mark and I have been using each other to get through our grocery dilemma, so he ask if I ate this shit. Obviously my answer is “No”, and this leaves the burden of being labeled a thief. Mark has got a heart of gold, and all they had to do was ask, but that was not the case. By asking that could have offered him an opportunity to go to the store to get more lunch meat. Could you imagine the shock when he went to make a sandwich, and someone had robbed him blind? This is an act of total disrespect.  Let’s use an example that everyone can see, and has to acknowledge. Wow. This site for instance. Here is Chase, offering stories, and past experiences. No matter what they may be, here comes Rob firing shots at him.  Look at Robs cake comment. Ouch!!! It had to have been hard, but Chase went on dodging the missile, and offered his perspective even further. Then Robb again, asking for no extended, fluffy dialog to over take his opinion.  It is clear that Rob has a personal issue with Chase. Who know how long ago this took place, but Rob seems to be holding a resentment. That is what is happening in this home. When stuff is taking place over this site, you can shut your computer off and come back to it when you are ready to. Here you have to live with the cocksucker while he refuses to give you your messages, and eats your food.  As for the cleanliness issue, to hell with them. I clean up after myself. That is all that is expected from me, by myself. That is all that matters to me because I have learned that worrying about others has gotten me no where. As long as I hold myself responsible for my actions, and not worry about theirs, I am not creating an unneeded high stress level.  All that I am getting at is that I don’t have to live like that today because of what this program has taught me. I am truly grateful for the opportunity to post my opinion. Thanks.
