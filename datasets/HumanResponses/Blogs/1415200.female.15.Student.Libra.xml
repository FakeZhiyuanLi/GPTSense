      I have learned never to expect anything from people. They always dissapoint. Especially, I never expect anything from myself. I never accomplish when there is stress. I hate people who have expactations for me, they want so much, from so little. I'm not much of an amount for anything. I can't even accomplish the task of finding myself, let alone any thing else. Everytime I put expactations into someone I am always more than let down. People have never fulfilled anything and I dont think they ever will, when ever I think I might have found that something in that person, and I am hoping that they can live up to me, they let me down. I think they have done that so much, I can't cry anymore. I am used to the fact that people dont care enough to let me feel ok that they have let me down, they just use me and that's it. I think I have only found one person that hasnt let me down yet, and I havent talked to him enough to really see what would happen. I cant seem to find myself. I better go. Pressure calls.

      Today was the first day of marching band. It was, to say the least, ok..I wish I could have slept in more, but we all cant have what we want. I need to talk to *mention random name here* I've been thinking about something...need to talk to him.. but, non the less im getting back into the swing off stuff, so I can ease back into the school year. Although it will be weird since it's the high school and all. But I'll just hang out with some people, maybe get a boi, and have fun this year. I haventha fun in such a long time. It i'll be nice to let my hair down, (both figurativly and literally). I have my friends, and Im gonna stick to them. I dont care what anybody says. They have no more the authority over me than I have over them i dont really much care if there older than me, because I just dont care. I have a solid group, and thats all I need. There supportive of me. Im gonna go. It's getting late. I'll write tomarrow.

      This summer has been truley boring. I have been completley anti-social..and I think that I need that. I dont need people interfereing with there problems I have enough of my own. Then again..Since I havent really talked to anyone this summer, I have absolulty no clue what is going on in the "social realm" nor do I care.  Marching band starts up again in 8 short days. Which will completley throw off my sleeping sense. I will have to get up at 8:00 in teh morning, and right now I am only getting up around 11:00 in the morning, and not going to bed until atleast 2:30-3:30 in the morning. I'm goingto be a complete wreck the first few days.  I havent came to any new conclusions recently. I havent anything to conclude. I have been completly honest with myself all this summer, and I have found what I was looking for. For once I have accomplished what I set for myslelf..even with time to spare. I hope everyone else has too.. because I know what it's like if you dont.  I really dont want to go into the high school..It seems like such a big step. Plus, I have gotten so used to going to the middle school that I really dont want to leave. But I guess it's a change I have to make, although its one I dont want to come to a conclusion about but I guess i have to. Dont worry.. I'll write later.

      I realized something while I was reading over my post's..I actually depend on people. While I was upset with *insert unmentioned person here*, for stupid reasons now that I look back on it..I was truley afraid, that if I lost our friendship, then who would that  leave me to tell all my problems to, and to give me a hug when I need it. Nobody else really acts like that towards me. I mean yeah, i have a few other friends..but they would judge me. I guess he's just one of the people I need in my life. I was shocked when i thought about it..I thought i was this "Miss Independant" (no pun intended) but I really am not. Im glad I realized it though, because maybe now I wont take the best thins in life for granted anymore.   I really need another episode of Brendan Leonard. . .  Well. I better get outa here..Oh, yeah..i changed my name to rotang because it sounds so much cooler..someone save me*

      "I will not die for your government or saffer religion, I choose life" - Brandon Boyd  I hate the fact people try to force your beliefs on you. The whole time as a child and a teenager, your supposed to be finding your self, but what if you can't even see who you are. All my child hood I was never forced into religion by my parents, we never attended church and I had never saw a bible. My grandparents on the other hand, sent me a bible in the mail for me to read. I thought it was a pretty good story. That's all it was to me was a story. Then I was shunned from the people at school, because in 5th grade, the only thing you really know about your self is what you belive in. All I knew was that I had nothing to believe. In 7th grade, I had made a choice to myself that i would study diffrent types of religion, to make sure I was affirmend in my agnostic ways. At the same time there was need of participants in the local youth org. i went for 7 or 8 months. Comming to the soild conclusion I am agnostic. I had to go threw all of that just to reach a conclusion that I am havingto defend from people who were forced into it and had no choice! I think it's bullshit that these people can go around and say shit about my religion when they dont even have a clear mind of thir own. I am so pissed off about it....im gonna go clear my head...I get so worked up over this...someone save me..

      "Moral: The pathetic thing that just gets in the way of everything." Why people dwell on weather or not you have the "Idealistic" morals or not...but whats the big deal. Morals are something that should be so deeply engrained into your skull that you dont even think about them. And this is only if you have any in the first place. I think our morals are just, as my father says, "A product of your enviroment" you learn them from the people who are around you. You are never taught them.  This summer is letting me think too much. I need another episode of Brendan Leonard.   Its horrible how much people depend on other people. They act like if someone wasnt there ALL the damn time, they might go off the edge or something. I am fine by myself. Maybe it's because I never had anyone here anyways..but I dont really think that would matter. As a basic human instinct you react for yourself...by yourself.  Not have to be right there with your hand being held. I think thats something that has done almost totally away with the human race today. And thats a very sad thing.   I need to go think somemore about a few controversial topics. I will write later. I still need another episode of Brendan Leonard.  I have to go. People cant survive without me.

      OMG! The game was horrible. First of all, we didnt play, second of all, the guys didnt show up. Meaning I had to brave the world and go to the game myself. O that was great fun! I came to a good conclusion though. I can't stand hanging out with the girls. They have horrible personalities. All they care bout are 4 things. Talking about each other, Clothes, boys, and gay random things. I almost went spaztic on them tonight, but saekho was there..thats not saying much, but, I didnt want them saying stuff bout her, cause she hangs with me. Evne though I already know they dig on her and shit cause of it. I gotta go, ('rents.)

Because we dont have to march this one. *SCORE* I gotta hook ciara up with her guy..That will take sometime. I have nothing to write. I have no clue whats wrong with me. I'll write after the game.

      I hate weekends.  I need to be around everyone again. Even though it seems like I get fed up with everyone, and irritated so easily, it's better when I dont have to think about things. There's too much happening at home. So much drama, damn communication.  I hate the way I act around people. Especially family. I still can't let them in, to really know me. I don't trust them. I couldnt change it if I wanted to tho. It's like embeded into my brian. WARNING! These are the people who 'have your back' dont let them in on anything. I hate feeling like a damn robot.  I regret acting like that. Once again, I hate the weekends. Thank you.

You don't care about presents or about going to fancy placed. Hell, just hang out.

      "Please don't play with me, my paper heart will bleed" -AAR If I was a toy, I would think my wind-up key was missing. I honestly don't know what it is anymore. There's just so much, and because of that, I can't even focus on one thing. There's just too much.  I know what I want out of life, that I can't have. I think I am an Emotionally Homeless person. Im sitting on the edge of your sidewalk, and my can is out, and that's the farthest I've gotten, because I don't even have a house to call you from.  The greatest prize in life is love, but whats to do when you have no absolution of it? I couldnt belive in love. If someone paid me a million dollars, I wouldnt.  "It's a known fact, when two opposites come together, it always ends in heartache." The sad thing is, most experiance heartache before there even together. But you couldnt tell that person, because most likley your trying to cover-up the fact you have feelings for that person. And you get upset if the person does something, or acts a certian way but they can't help it, because they have no clue as to what their doing wrong.  I wish we were all dead to the emotion of love, like robots. That would just make life easier to get thru, so of coarse that would never happen.  "Cause I'd never do something intentionally just hurt you And I've stared at the sky and I've asked myself why you've become like an angel to me"    ~Allister Pain isn't planned, because it's always there. Never goes away, Never show remorse. It's like a ugly scar from a long time ago. Even the best neosporin can't take this away. I know my ramblings don't leave you to much of a plot line, but it's 10:00 in the morning, and I just cant take much more of this.

      umm... Well, to everyone who reads this damn thing, for some reason or another, I'll let you in on a little secret, today was very interesting. My bandmates and I had.."rehersal" if you want to call it that. Which was very interesting. Band sucked as usual. There's no mystery to that. The only awesome thing is, we dont have a.m. rehersal, so I get to sleep in! WOAH! Tomarrow is our first football game. And we gotta go all the way to that one place..um..Conneaut, that will be very interesting.  I really dont have anything to say. The usual people pissed me off, and thats about it. *COUGH COUGH* They know who they are. If they dont, their even bigger jackasses then I thought.   If something happens, I'll write later, if not, I'll catch you after the game.

      the bus from hell. "I hope that when you wake up, everything that you've ever wished for is dead in your arms." I hate having competitions. I'm not that kind of girl. Especially when the prize is sumthing that I should of had from the start, but the other person is...and ruined it. *cough cough* No, I am not obvious. Im just always pissed. I rarely talk about my problems, as people now know. I never did before, why start now. In all reality, I know there might be a few people who actually care and want to know..The others jut go and form a pity crowd. But Ive already been thru that explanation.  Our bus rides are very interesting..*COUGH COUGH* Our small group.. you know what I mean. And yet again, I am the only one who didnt get anything. Tear. But thats ok. Conneaut is in 2 days. Which means a hour and a half bus ride. I know who I'm sitting with..*smile cheesy grin*  School starts in about 12 days. Thats too soon for me. I need more time to listen to my 'Fuck off because the world doesnt care on the back of the bus music.' Not really..I need someone who cares.. Later..

      Misery has company.  "Today the weight of the world was on my shoulders, my life, wasnt spared. I hoped you would come, to help me out, but I found you never really cared." 8-20-03 I hate people who make assumptions about me. Not even half of the people I hang out with really know me. They know the shaded side of me. The front that I put up. If I really acted the way I am at home, I would probably sit in the back of the class, in the corner, thinking of so much, that it means nothing at all. People see the happy side of me, and they think im depressed, I would hate to see their reaction now. (and to everyone who has read this, or is reading it now, im not a mental case. dont even think about it..) I can't help it though, I try to talk to people. They all just seem to depend on me to hear there problems, and deal with the problems for them, but if I would try to talk to someone, they would just blow me off and start on some completly random subject.  I think the problem, isn't so much a 'me' thing. Everybody else is just way to self centered, to give a damn about how I feel. And if I would be sad, or angry, it's not like I could tell anyone, because I can tell that most of it, is just out of pity. I wont stoop down to that level.  On the brighter side of the rainbow.. Tonight is our first preformance, woo..(in sarcastic voice...) I really dont want to go. I just want to sleep. I mean, we march pretty good, and sound pretty good..It's just that, this means I have to see everybody,  and cover my front up again. And I am not in the mood for that. I rather slip into my emo mood and sit in the dark, while playing some music, and think more about  why I am like I am. But thats just me. I might go and try out for 'Romeo and Juliet.' KSU is doing a production, and they need a 14 yr. old. right up my ally. Plus I already have more than half memorized, so it wouldnt be too hard.  I dread the day that school starts. UGH! I'll probably end up spazing out on someone, or freaking out, and that's never too pretty. I hope I dont. But hey, im unpredictable.  After dad leaves, I think im going to go and rest. I need some sleep. I need to think and relax. This day sucks. I'll write tonight when I get home. Someone save me.

      Things are known.  Everyone is catching on to me. I have people, left, and right asking me about it. I didnt know I was like a book. I dont think im so confused now. I kinda thought things thru a little bit last night, and today. Now it's just a race against time. I can't believe her. Being so selfish like that. I should have knew it would end up this way. She'll try and beat me to the punch, I know it. So, now, I am forced into making a decision I really dont want to make. About being inqusitive or not. (you get the point.) The thing is, I dont want this to turn out like another version of No Doubt. That would just suck. I know 'other people' dont want me to, for the sake of us all, but my feelings are telling me diffrent. But sometimes there blind. I dont want to just let this sit back and take it's coarse. I am afriad of the outcome.  I need to go and stratagise. Before it's too late, and the whole situation becomes "The one that got away"

      Today was a torment, of my own hell. I havent been this confused, for over a year now. and just when I think that things are beginning to look up for me..BAM! things just hit me like a train, and I dont know what to do.. I cant just tell people my confusion, first of all, they most likley dont care and just want some dirt to burn me with later, and if they do care, they have no clue of what to say, or do to help me, which to me is absolutly pointless. So I have to sit here completly alone, and try and console myself through this, before someone makes a move. I dont want anyone to make a move..I dont want to have to regret any of my actions. I dont want to be forced into a decision I dont think I can full heartily make. Especially because I know how it feels and I dont want to be the reason for another broken heart.  I dont think I could put either one of them through that. Plus there best Friends. Now, how am I supposed to deal with that. If I would do anything with one, they would probably just turn around and go tell the other, and vice versa. And I know that that feels like an extreme kick to the chest. I wish that this would all go away. I even felt like going away to some far off place and putting thisall behind me, that way they would both come out even. Because neither one of them is better than the other.  I cant keep this all in my head though..I might just go completly insane and up a wall if I would. And for fear of someone involved in this, reading this, and getting more info then what I need for them to have, I cant write anything that they can take out of context. So to save myself from more of a head ache, and more pain..Im going to stop here..and if I can I'll write later.  pain is inevitalbe, misery is optional...enjoy the ride.

      Well, band camp was last week. As I like to call it, Hell Week. School is in 16 days, and counting. I really dont want to go. It'll be cool to be with all the guys again and stuff, but I dont want to deal with the other people. That IS going to suck.   I am really really really confused again..Thats half the reason I spazed out at band camp. I havent told anybody why yet..and I dont think Im going to. It's not the kinda thing I can just come out and tell people. Plus, it was more than just what was going thru my head. It was people pissing me off, and not caring about it. I really hope no body finds that hole in the wall that I punched... The horrible thing is, I cant even tell the guys what happened, because that would put them in such a awkward postion, and there too good of friends to do that too.   One a brighter note.. I learned tat I can unwrap a starburst in my mouth and a piece of Orbit gum. Im still working on a hershey kiss, but I know Ill be able to do that too.   I dont want to go back to band tomarrow. I only had 2 days off. Thats not enough! I need a week to recoupe. Im still kinda sick and tired from the food up in Edinboro. Damn Pizza. I dont want this school year to end. The sooner it does, the sooner I have to loose all my friends to the real world. That will just fucking suck. I better be going. I have to find out whats all going down tomarrow. Guys never tell me anything. Later.

      Well. I guess I am not so confused...and not so sad. Which is a good thing, because Im going into my second week, and we have band camp in exactly 7 days. That really sucks. That also means school is right around the corner. And personally I dont want to technically "go" into the high school. I just want to move into the grade ahed of me. My grade is just SO boring, conforming, and just like everyone else. Which is horrible in my point of view. LALALALALALA...LMAO!.. I gotta go because I have absolulty nothing to talk about and people I actually do talk to online, might be getting on shortly, or else I will have to be getting off very shortly! Either way it works..shortly!!

      Well, Its after the first week, and IM SO CONFUSED!!!! I like all the music were playing, it's really easy. And our band has been doing good. We kinda made our first song, called "Huh?" it's sweet, but we kinda wrote it in about 15 mins. We need the melody and the ska breaks now. The best song, is "Surf Wax America" by weezer. That song owns. Im horrible confused. I need still need to talk to some one.. or i might possbly go insane.  I havent seen The Brendan Leonard Show in about a week or so now. I miss it.. but I have alot of...other....things to worry about. Corey better not be acting like a jerk. He only has came to 1/2 of the practices. We need to get Dan in the band. that way someone would actually be there to play.  I cant wait for band camp...I really need to get a NEW BATHING SUIT!! Teh other one, is too, not there. And the guys will be there. Well I have to go.. I have to come up with dinner plans.

      Thank you for visting 2003, cuz 2004 herre I come!! This year's gonna be great. I know it. I can feel it. Good things are going to be comming. And its about damn time! Too many horrible things have happened to me this year. Too many to count on my fingers and toes.  Wow, im on the phone with Sarah. Were confirming our evil plans for tonight. Which include movies, pizza, watching 4 little girls, and acting like complete morons!! YeS! Thats what we defintily do best. I must say. I wonder what the guys are doing for New Years?? Oh, well. I really dont care anymore. They dont give a fuck about me, or whats going on, so why should I care about them. I take that back. One cares. Thats it. And who that is, you know who you are. and it's defintly not the obvious. Dude, the Alice 19th manga is totally awesome! I love that one. dothack was pretty good, but I seem to like Alice 19th and Love Hina more. My Aunt, Uncle, and cousin are uptown from Columbus. Thats cool. My Aunt is awesome to hang out with. My cousin is 11 and he's at the stage where he thinks he knows everything that is going on and how to do everything. And he has no fucking clue. It's hilarious, yet agrivating at the same time. I know, I know I went thru the same thing..but I wasnt obvious about any of it. Well Im gonna skidattle, haha, I cant wait to party. Im gonna go pick something out to wear, and get a tshirt for Sarah. If anyone cares have a great NY!!

      "I feel diseased Is there no sympathy, for the sun  The sky's still fire But I am safe in here, from the world outside So tell me What's the price to pay for glory" - Finch  Hate. I think Hate is a strong enough word. But maybe it's not.  I hate him. That's all there is to it. I can't stand to think about him, I can't stand to look at him, I can't even stand to say his name. So I'm not. He acts like he's my best friend, he acts like he doesnt know me. His a double-eged sword, and I sometimes wish that I never became friends...with him. But enough with that. I need some movie ideas. I gots my camcorder for xmas this year, and all the editing equipment to go along. I need to write scripts, and have willing-non-paid actors to come and be in my movies.  I get to go back to school on Monday. Not today. Next monday. Oh, joy. (sarcasim) I really dont want to go back, because that means I have to see certain people. But on the other hand I will get to see the gorgeous Jon, (see previous entry.) *smile.*  "There I am standing all alone on the Sydney Harbor Brige. And you know I would jump into the fucking ocean if it meant I was truly capable of being satisfyed. Will I ever be? Did I just give up the best thing I ever had?" The Ataris.

      Now I find out how much people really care. I've noticed that when you have to see a person repedtly, it's hard to get away from that person. It's like your addicted to them. But when your givin an oppertunity to "escape" from them for a while, people eat it right up!  Finchaholic. Atariholic. Incuaholic. I'm a very "holic" person. I absoultly love the song "What it's like to burn," by Finch. It's amazing. The construction, Lyrics, Emotion, it's all amazing. I think I've been listing to it for 2 days straight. I've also been consumed by "Megalomanic" from Incubus. It's off of their new CD thats not out yet. Also, its like there old stuff, like a mix of Science, and Make Yourself.   I hope theres no snow on the ground for xmas. That way everyone is upset and it creates major chaos. Haha. What I wouldnt give to be able to make something go wrong.   I feel bad for the Fall From Betweeners. They didnt win battle of the bands last night at peabodys. I think their egos are damaged a little. Im still planning on seeing them for New Years Eve. I want to get a picture with the group and with the almighty Jon. He's a gorgeous man. It's one of the situations, where you can look but you cant touch, not only because he's taken, but because he wouldnt spend a second of his time with the likes of me.  Belive me, I do look.  Oh well. Im on my search for something, even though the lack for motivation, isnt any help. I guess eventually someone will show up for me. Eventually isnt soon enough.  I wish I had the power to take everything back, the right and the wrong decisions that Ive made, and make it all diffrent. I dunno. I want to move and become unknown. Im gonna go. Gotta go wrapup the fucking holidae shopping.

      "Think of today as a much-deserved day of rest, dear Libra. You are usually the one people turn to when they need comfort and consolation. Today, however, in spite of the tension that's in the air, your words seem to have no effect. Good! Let other people take care of themselves for a change."  Words need no guidence. Actions do. So misconcepted. People never get what im trying to get across. They take it out of context and blow it out of proportion. I can't make a friendly gesture, with out someone taking it wrong.  Where's Brendan Leonard? ---> This was my favorite show over the summer, and it's gone! I havent seen it in months. Maybe someone thefted ABCfamily of the tapes. I think I need to place a call to the russian mafia.  Wow. It's 11:57, as I type. That means only 2 days until I can open up my x-mas presents. (Note: At the household, we open gifts on x-mas eve. Just for the simple fact were too lazy to wake up early on x-mas day, and I dont feel like waiting that long.)  No one showed up today. I tried calling but his line was busy. I think he doesnt want anything to do with me anymore. It's awefully funny (sarcasim) how they ditched us Friday, and how we havent gone anyplace just the normal 3 of us in a few weeks. I have a feeling something's up. Not like I could approch him about it though. Oh yeah I could see it now. Me: How come we never do anything anymore? Him: What do you mean? Me: Well we used to go places, walk alot and talk on the phone. We dont do any of that anymore. Him: Meh, dunno. Why do you care so much? Me: Because I still like you alot. Even though you used me, and ect..yeah. Him: WAAAH!?!? ---That would go over oh-so-smoothly. I need to move on to somebody else. Somebody better, who shows more respect, and who dosent want me to be something im not. But I have no clue who that is. Oh, well I guess Im not the like-able type because no one likes me like that. I made cookies today. Peanut Butter ones. The 'rents liked them. But I got sick both times after eating them. I think im allergic to Peanut Butter. That would suck. Oh, deary me. It's 12:08. and I gots some stuff to get yet. If I can I will write later. If not then I will tomarrow sometime. *Someone Save me.*

      Bright morning. Dim mind. I hate getting up this early on weekends. It's 9:31, and for all of you without an Ohio residence its bright, cold, and windy outside. Not too pleasent.  It is amazing to think that only 5 months ago I was laying around with friends complaining about being too hot, and thinking that I was going to die of heat damage. But I guess that just goes on to prove that time is going by so quickly we dont fully have a concept of it. I think everyones comming over today. It'll be entertaining.  I hate Christmas. I hate the corny, over the top, extent that people go thru to make it "special" yeah, it's special enough to puke over. If I was in charge of a household, I probably wouldnt even decorate. I see no sense in putting out all of this stuff, like statues, trees, tinsel, ect.. for a month out of the year, and then packing it all up so you can put yourself thru it again next year. I also hate the family get-to-gethers. Actually, I just hate family. They make to big of a deal about "how I've turned out." I think I turned out just fine thank you. I dont steal, I dont do drugs, I do really good in school, and I have alot of good friends. In my book that makes a pretty good person. Im still sick if anybody was wondering. If anyone cares.  I dont think anybody cares about me. They care about using me. They care about having someone to take their anger out on, or to get money off of. But once again, Im almost to the point where I absolutly dont care anymore...Im gonna go think about some stuff. I'll write later.

      "I just found a friend in one of your lies, to treat me so nice, I can't belive my bones."  - Ever So Sweet. The early November.  That's right folks, it's Christmas Vacation. A time of Boredom, Insomnia, Fights, and tears. I can't wait!  I know, I know..I do need this break. I need it to take time from everyone who's been driving me up the wall the past 5 months. I dont think I have anymore wall to go up with out reaching the ceiling. New Years Eve will be fun though. Sarah and I are going to go to the Section 8 show to go and see Fall From Between. Fall From Between hit Brookfield like a new boy band hits TRL. All of a sudden everyone was a emo indie kid! How amazing! Now, dont take this the wrong way, they are a pretty jazzy get together, but when everyone and there grandma are so emo-licious it gets kind of overrated.  I want to go back to New York City. That was ah-mazing. The people, the sights, it makes me feel all stuffed up and cloggy inside! Or maybe thats because I got sick again from it. Tonsilitius, Pink Eye, Ear Infecton, oh yeah i got it all. If anyone wants to be sick and miss some school, call me. I wish I had someone I could talk to. Someone I could spill my heart out to, and they would listen. I dont have anyone like that. No one will listen to me. There too self absorbed to give a damn about me. It really makes me angry, but theres nothing I can do about it. Im not a mean person. As much as everyone tells me that I dont "have" to be nice to people I just can't help it. And with that, people just walk all over me and use me as a welcome mat for there problems. Maybe thats what I can attempt to change over break. Im not going to be so willing to listen. Maybe then they will all get the hint. Just maybe. Oh well. It's not like I have a choice. I just dont care anymore.

      A void.  Things have been moving to fast to attempt to type it all. So I guess to avoid that, I will continue from now.  Situations have come and gone, but I've kept my cool and stayed the same. Bonds have broken, been fixed and broken again. But we're on a road of empires and things like that just take it's tole. Things have happened in my life these past 3 months that will mean more to me than I ever know now. Grandma dying, Break-Ups, Make-Ups and Shake ups, and I realized that some friendships are no longer there. But I guess this is just the cycle that I fell into, and not by option.  I have also been trying to figure out what people dont like about me. I've asked my camarades what they think. But they havent been able to come up with anything.  I know Im not a perfect sociable being. Something must be wrong. Im also in search of something. Something I honestly dont think Ill be able to find. I still have attachments to a certian person, and I have been trying to keep it a secret, but people are catching on. If they catch on to anything, its not Algebra, or Science, but who you have feelings for. I can't help it. I dont know what it is. I've tried everything. Like having feelings for someone new, thinking about all of these horible things they never even did, and such..but it doesnt work! It makes me so aggravated. Especially when you tell someone who you think you can trust, and it turns out to be someone who can't keep there mouth shut. Not mentioing any names or anything.  But with all of this I've decided to use the energy for a greater good. Like studying and reading Manga. Yes, you read correctly..m-a-n-g-a. That thing also known as anime. Its awesome, Im reading Love Hina, and .Hack\\Legend of the Twilight. Well, its Harry's Love Hina, but the other one is mine. Things are definitly changing and I have no clue about what to do. Im out for now. But I'll prolly write later.  ~Me.

      Sorry Im the person I am. If I could I wouldnt be me. Too Bad. Already am.  I went over to Harry's today. Then we went sledding for quiet awhile. We ran into Tom and Scott, and went sledding with them. Then we got cold and hungry and decided to head back. Then we goofed off for a while and ate some dinner.  I realized what I needed to along time ago.  Why am I the way I am? Why do I have to be the one stuck so depressed all the time, and why do I have to be the odd one out by the whole vegetarian scheme? If I was normal like every other ska-bunctious kid then maybe I wouldnt be such a problem. Thats all I am. A problem. While im deep in thought, im going to go listen to some Early November, and think about some stuff.  Nights are too long. Hope will never come.

      well. its been a few days. but ive been busy. as always. spent the weekend with my aunt in hubbard. its cold as a mother outside. I havent been in much of a mood lately. I guess that comes from thinking too much.  Loneliness is a state of mind, not a state of being. :: jaTR 3:07  ::   Wow. Isnt that a true mission statement of life.  I think later, like around noon, im going to place a call to the guys and see if they want to do anything. Im thinking sno-boarding. but its fucking-cold-ass outside and I dont know if I want to brave the weather.  Yeah, im still sick. But i dont think they know whats wrong with me. Sometimes when I eat, well after I eat, I get really cold, and really sick to my stomach all at the same time. Then I get really dizzy, almost blacked out. I dont think thats good. but thats between me and you. Im almost done reading the first vol. of  Ceres  it's pretty good. then again I like alot of Yu Watatse's works. So there you go. I know this is short, but I gotta go. Im getting really sick again, because I ate a pop-tart. I'll blog later. Maybe when the guys are here.

      Today wasnt any better. What a surprise. Mid-terms are over. I can have my brain back. Single sentance. Double sentance. Bored as hell. Always am. Depressed as a mother. Always that to.  You might think that because im cheerful in school. Im cheerful all the time.  You thought wrong. I can be deciving. Three months untill permit time, and 8 months and three days untill freedom. Forever until I get a life, and make things right. but whats new. Im gonna go, because no body cares. Well a few people might.  And, that's another story kids.

       Yeah I get it. Nobody fucking cares.   People act like im stupid and cant see thru what their doing. But to reassure those certain folks, I can. The outside shades the depths of reality.  Wow. I love this song. I've had it stuck in my head for the past week.  "It's my life," No Doubt. I kno I kno. Kinda corny, but it has a cool guitar part, and the pedals are awesome. I want a pedal. I want a life. I want some chinese food. There you have it. Three more things. Have fun. -It used to all be fun and games, until things changed. Like Ive said. I dont like change. I dont like snow. Or the artic.  I want to be a pirate.  Im sick. I think. Ive had random dizzy, nausea and tiredness spells. I dont think thats a completly normal thing. I cant tell the parents. I just got over having the flu, tonsilitus, Bronchitus and almost namonia. (_ Im not a very needy person. I only want a few things. But I cant get those. I guess I either dont have any luck. Or no one gives a fuck about me. Im thinking its a combination of both.  Im going to go before I depress all of you too much. I wouldnt want it to wear off.  I dont care anymore. cuz nobody ever did.

        Forget me. It's that simple.   You say hate is such a strong word. And yet. I use it most often.  Coming from an agnostic person, I hope you should take my theory to heart. As Ive seen more sorrow than you religious pukes will ever. I see the normal human being. They belive what they've been taught from the start of their time. God Created them. And things are fine..as long as you have absolution. Others, who are agnostic, were (most likley) not grown up on religion. We just know that we are here, and we can do what we want with it. And thats life.  Well, sitting there the other day, I realized how sad I was, and all the while I was thinking, "I bet the kid who prays before bed, has never been as down as this, and I bet he will never know what the end is like before it actually happens." Then I put into my mind the prospective that if there was a lord that heals the wounded and aids the sorrow of the world, that wouldnt this be a fitting punishment for all the disbelivers?  If I were god, I would think so.  Im not saying the whole ordeal made me into a beliver, because it didnt. But it made me think. It's still making me think.  I hate thinking.   "Its funny how I found myself, and realized how I was played upon, from your game, but its MY life, dont you forget.."

       Well  I  was  going to update yesterday, but I didnt get online untill 12:30 a.m. and by that time, I was wayyy t tired.  The guys came over yesterday, Dan, Harry, and Joe. It was fun. We tryed to figure out songs for our band..that never goes well. I think we have one song on the list, good job kids. Then we decided to act like moe-rons, and try snowboarding, even though we have no snow only mud. Then we played twister for like 3 hrs. omfg my knee hurts like a damn mofo!  It's so cold outside. I hate the cold. I hate hamburgers. I hate peppers. Yeah, now what.  I dont want to go back to school tomarrow. Nope I dont. I like the weekends. Sleep. Food. Music. How much more fun could it get. Besides not having to do fucking mid-term reviews that the bitchass teachers give us.  The parentals are bugging me about college already. They wanna know what im gonna major in, what school I wanna go to, tuiton costs...I have no clue. I want to go somewhere in New York City, Like NYU. I want to do advertising layouts for people, like musicians. That way I get to meet awesome people, and yet I get paid good money. What more could you want? I wish I lived in Cocoa Beach. That way I could surf all the time, and be really good at it. And it would rarely ever get tooooo cooold. Oh well. Not like anyone is reading this besides you. Not like anyone cares. But oh well. I dont care anymore.

All include: Dan, Harry, Pat, Bob, Jeanette, myself, and I think thats it. Then Harry, Dan, Joe are all comming over tomarrow. I think Rob is comming later. Oh well gotta go plead with mom.  --Later-- Alright. It's 9:15. Serious update time. Let's rock da socks off! Well chineese was fun. Though, Pat and Jeanette didn't show. I forgot Jen was grounded and that Pat dosent do anything without his better half. Oops. So it was just me, dan, harry, and bob. O yea. Harry's gma was there too.  I miss having our group together. Just the 4 of us. It hasnt been that way in a while. So, I guess things are just changing. Have I ever told you I dont like change? I dont like change. Gots a new sn. I didnt like the xsurfpunk07 thing. Kinda gay. Oh, well. Im gonna go. I gotta get an icon. Plus, I cant type 'hard' the mother is sleeping. and drama calls. Like ive said before. Ppl cant live without me.

Belive it or not, there's so many things that you can come up with while writing a french paper. I came with a new slanguage. Oh well. I'll write it later. My head hurts. I dont feel good.

      I got mad love for Pippen.  That movie was ah-mazing. I don't think anyone could really expect a better production themselves..except maybe Tolkin himself.  Well, today was the first day back to school. After a very long two weeks. Things, were in better condition than I expected them to be. Harry talked to me like nothing was wrong. I was completly shocked. I thought he hated me. I bet Rachel said something. She always does.  I think i'm gonna buy a few packages of twizzlers, just to attack Bob with. And yes, I still have welts on my arms. I bet Dan does too. Wow, Corey came back. It's been forever and 3ft since I've seen him. I swear to you he has grown like 3ft. Hes almost as tall as me! Thats really ah-mazing. I don't want to go back to school tomarrow. I think I'm getting sick again. I just got over being sick!! I have a theory that I need my tonsils removed. I dont want to have my tonsils removed. That scares me. . . wow. something scares me.  Theres a certan extent that you can talk to a family member, without them becoming extremly annoying, or to a pont that they know way to much about you to ignore them. because that folks is were a little thing called BlackMail comes in. And thats NOT COOL.  I need to find the Alice 19th mangas. Waldens didnt have them, but they did have .hack\\ and I'm reading that, but I like Alice 19th better.  So many social issues. So much drama. But what else is High School about?

      Alright. Don't scurry, this wont take long. I dont think I need away messages. Everytime I put up and away message, something important is asked, or happened. And by the time I check those messages, they're signed off. WTF! Yesterday, Bob wanted to get some people together and go to the movies. I have been wanting to do that for SOO long! But because my away was up, I didnt get the message, and he signed off. That fucking sucks. Then, what happens, is if I dont put up my away message, then no one will message me and I am stuck browsing the net untill I have seen everything. And people told me that it was impossible! Umph! I watched a movie yesterday. Called "The St. Francisville Experiment." It was actually really kinda cool, untill the last 10 mins. when things got totally unbelieveable. Like a ghost cutting this fucking annoying psychic up, and she just stood there like a moron, screaming, covered in blood. Or, Tim. My, my, my. I was disapointed in Tim. He was so awesome, and became my favorite, and he had the cheesiest ending. The Blair Witch kind of thing. Ryan (a girl) was really lame too. She was the most terrifyed, and also had one of the cheesiest endings. Her table started shaking, and she fell thru the floor. They all ended up in some tourcher chamber that was secretly hidden thru a closet in the house. (tim found it first) They did have some good aspects, like the chair, (hey kids, that one worked.) And the little things. But WTF! Havent you ever seen a scurry movie before!?! Alright. I get frustrated when filmaking goes wry.  Well, today Aunt Kathy and I are going to go see 'The Return of the King.' Were gonna go to the 4:00 showing. So, we problably wont get back until 8 or so. Yayy! Then I have school tomarrow. I dont wanna go!! I do, so I can get out of the house, but I dont because I dont want to have to but up with all the hysterics that are going to becoming from everyone. Oh, and I am going to re-dye my hair tonight. The red is really fading, so I got a new bottle last night. wOOt! Ok. Im out like a light. Write later. Promise.

      Friends can surprise you. You can be surprised. Everything was fun. The Band. The really crappy-gay 80's board games. Sitting at the end of her driveway at 1 a.m. The deep convos. Cold Pizza. Sparklers. "Coke-a-Cola." Yelling out the window like a retard at Ryan, Jon and T.J. Barb-b-cue Chips.  I thought. "Hey dummy, it's new years. I need resolutions. Cool resolutions." So, I thought what better place to put them but my blog-of-fame. Or, blog-of-shame. 1.) Forget about any feelings I have previously felt for *shall remain silent*  2.) Become a in-cogneto-super-hero. (anime-style. ah-hahaha.) With select powers I will list after..*grin*  3.) Become more self-confident.  4.) Loose (atleast) 10 lbs. (I kno, I had to throw it in!!)  Thats about it. I only want to make those I think I can accomplish! And I think those are pretty good. Ok. Now I'll elaborate on the super-powers. The power to fly. ( a must!) Ablity to teleport! (totally awesome) MindReading. (another must) Immortality. (^^) The power to make guys fall in love. Any guy. *wink* I think thats about all for right now. I'll for surley come up with some more later on. I'll update again then too. Ugh! School starts again in 4 days. That is Monday. Too soon. I don't want to deal with *HIS* bitchass and the problems that risen over break. Oh, well. I guess I'll say enough is enough cuz it's not comming back from him. I can't win.

      -Song- "Hands Down" Dashboard Confessional -Mood- Blah.  Yeah, I'm not angry anymore. Well not enough to mean anything to you anyways. After I posted earlier, I went for a very looong walk. For like 2 hours I was gone. I was down in the bottom, in the woods..haha I was running from the people on the quads! It was crazy-hu-ha-hu-hu-ha! I hate the way I am. I hate being so funny, and so loud. I hate it. I wish I was more quiet and serious about alot of stuff. I wish I was more studious. People can't take me seriously. I can't take my self seriously. Maybe that's the reason I can never get a boyfriend. They have infurity complexes when Im around, because Im so loud. Guys always have to be the center of attention.  I dont know what I could do to change that though. I mean I can't just change in a snap. Things take time. I never seem to have anytime. I hate this shiz. -*argh*- Oh well.  I think Im going to go on a scary movie marathon! I need one! I love those movies.  Oh, snap jesus, that kid has kicks. I need to read more some more of Edgar Allen Poe. He was such a genious for his time. He creates such atmosphere, and dramatities with words. 'The Cask of Amantillado.' Its very good. You can learn a thing or two about revenge in that short story. 0o; Well ima go. I need something. I dont know what yet. If you kno, let me know. I'll love you 4-lyfe!! Okay. Nevermind I've got something else to complain about.  I hate people. I hate people. I hate people. I hate people. I hate people. I hate people. I hate people. I hate people. I hate people.

      Hello fellow readers. This is time for another instal-ment of things that make Heather mad, and what she hates. -ding!- Okay. First of all. Alot of things have been making me mad. Dont ask me why, because I am normally a very not-mad person. Argh. Like, I can't stand it when people ask me a million bizgillion questions on the saaame topic I mind you, that I told them from the get go I dont know much about. Okay, the second thing that makes me angry is when people say that there going to do something, and they dont. When they completly blow the person off. That is really horrible. I can't stand that for the life of me. Third of all. It's really nice outside, but do you think I have anyone to go walking with, or go do something with? No. No. No. I am such a loser, that I have to spend it all inside on the computer typing in this damn blogger because no one ever wants to do anything. Ugh!  *phew* Now, onto what I hate.  I hate alot of things latley. I dont normally hate anyone/anything. I dont know whats wrong with me. Im not going to go into an extreme amount of detail, but yeah. It makes me soo aggravated because I cant say what I want to say. I always feel like Im saying something stupid. Or that something isnt right. People have that affect on me. I hate my four wheeler, because I accidently blew out one of the tires last winter, and I havent been able to ride for like 3 months now. Riding was defnintly one of my 'ska' things. That makes me so mad. I dont know what to do. But dont worry about me. Because no one ever has, and no one ever will. BaH! Im going to go before I get really mad.  Some one Save me. I will love you forever if you do!

       I thought I had everything figured out.   Yeah, go figure. Let's see. At the beginning of last week, things were good. They were actually more than good they were great.  cue *happy ska, happy ska* Than things started to turn around in simple directions. And I got lost. Did I mention I am  still  lost? Eyah.  Things suck. Charades in band was a riot tho! And for the record. My happy streak was only 10 days. Ahem.  "Anthem of our dying day," is an awesome song. I suggest all of you go out to your pc and download it. Yes. That's right.. ^^It's by Story of the Year,  if any of you were actually going to dl it. Im going to go. My head is a mess. Blah. I need someone to talk to, and a drummer. That stuff makes it possible. Holy cruton of Christ. Someone save me..I'll love you forever if you can.

      Mmmkay. It's been a few days. But my brain has been pulling a double-over time.  I need some pink lemonade.  That stuff makes it possible.  Well. My good mood, has lasted for the longest I think a good mood has ever lasted. Oh, wait. It hasn't lasted 11 days yet. *cough* Yeah. And I actually found a ska band that I can stand longer than I work out. There called 'Madness.' Well, I only hurd one song, so I dont know if I could stand them for that long, but..eyeah. I need to find a new drummer. The ska band needs one. If anyone is a drummer, and good, IM me @ xsurfpunk07 or sign the board with your info. If you do, I will have mad love for you for life and go out on a date with you (^_^)   I seriously need a life I swear. All I do is sit at home on the computer, or reading.  If anyone would like to come save me sometime, be happy to stop on over. I need some company.  Okay, I lied that good mood is kinda going away. Don't ask me why. I dont feel like going into specifics. I just need a few ears to talk it out with. Yeah. (I'll translate the Heather language into normalcey for some of you..) That means I wont talk about it because .. A. No one cares. B. Ppl who do care..dont. C. I dont like talking about my problems. There you have it folks. That makes it possible.  Im gonna go talk to some more ppl. (which means ima go aimlessly click the screen) It's gonna take more than just a flotation device to save me.

       I'm Anti-Valentines Day. What about you?   Well, it's still early in the day, so something might happen.  Woops! I lied. The guys (Harry, Dan, Joe, maybies Bob?) are comming over, and are bringing there instruments! What a first! They won't be here until noon-ish. That means I hafta practice my part and stuff before then. Yeah. I was in a really good mood yesterday.   Was.  I don't understand anything anymore. I thought I had a concept of how everything worked, but I dont. I totally have no clue.  Remember back in like 4th grade, we would have to wear nametags and go around the room saying how we felt and things like that?  I wish I could do that again.  Later when the guys leave, I am going to have a horror movie marathon. Maybies. I might call Rachel Martin and see what she's up to this Valentines Day. Then we could go TO THE MALL! Yesh! Our Plans!   For the record. My 'curse' is gone.   People are really stupid. I felt like I should make that known. Yeah I might go see Trapt on the 17th. That would be so awesome. There playing up in Struthers for $15. I dont know if I really want to go, but Dad is excited about it, and that's rad.  Track starts in less han a month. That is so kickass. I gotta go get my physical, and I hafta go get new shoes. The last pair dissapeared. I have no clue where they went. Im gonna go listen to Brand New.  Im also going to go make a Anti-Valentines Day mix. Haha! Im sucha lozer! Yay!       What is your emo band name? by  urlLink  spiralinghalo        Your band name is:    Tuesday not Monday      You sound like:    The Dismemberment Plan      You will be signed to:    Vagrant Records      Your emo lyrics are:    "I hate myself, I&#39;m going to cry now"      Name:                  Created with  urlLink   quill18  's  urlLink  MemeGen 2.0  !

      New Conclusions. My, my, my. This could get interesting.  Yeah, today we had early dismissal. That means more online time!  I have like no life. I made the amazing new discovery that I absolulty am over the past, and I could care less! It's great. I feel so happy.  I havent felt that way in a long time. (yes, that means i feel ska.) Today, when I woke up, I thought about nothing at all. I had no worries, I had no complains (except it was too early and I was still tired) no stress about anything. I found by the way a new band that is awesome. Well, they may not be new, but they are awesome. 'The Postal Service' I love it! Its like emo-trance-bright-eyes goodness!  I need some more pink lemonade. That stuff makes it possible! I'll take 'O' for the win.  Oh, we suceeded in finding my ska thing. Yeah. As odd as it may sound, it's emo music, but in the same sense it's something else. Yeah I guess you could say that. Hum. ^ there a good band too! Goodness, Sarah's rapidly increasing A.D.D case is slowly wearing off onto me. I can tell.  I cant wait. I want to make a movie, 'The true life, of ding dong ditch.' And go around and play the prank on lots of people, and have me catch it all on film. That would be ah-mazing. I was kinda depressed today. I didnt get any carnations. At all. Everyone else did, but not me. I wish I could of gotten a silly flower. Even though it will die just like everything else. But oh well! enough of the sad stuff! Im gonna skidattle. Who ever is reading this needs to sign the tagboard. Yeah. Thats right. lol.

      If I told you that today was a very eventful than I was wrong. This could GET eventful!   --Finish Later. I've got some talking to a certain person to do.--  Wow. Yeah that was awesome. Okay. Besides that. Today has been very boring. As always.  Tommarow we get out early. That will rock. I might end up riding the bus home with Sarah and spend the night over there. That would get interesting. We go absolutly crazy. haha. I dont know. I have been in a really good mood today. For some randomly odd reason. *wink* I better skidattle. Sign the tagboard thing. Its awesome. Yeah. Go kick some ass.

      Yeah. It's been a few days. Today, I realized just how much my life sucks. All I do is come home, go straight to the internet, get off, read, do homework and go to sleep. Im the ephiphany of a geek.  Theres a new kid in school. Got a good sense of humor, nice personality. Someone I need to get to know better. Yeah. Valentine's Day is in three days. Oh, joy. Another Valentines Day wasted on my own self loathing because im too big of a loser to have anyone. Go me. And me and sarah's buisness hasnt recieved any customers. Yeah. Thats what I thought. If I could see into the future when I was 6, and see just how I turned out, I would killed myself then. I'll take 'X' for the block. School does nothing but bore me anymore. The only class I actually enjoy would be Algebra because it's a challenge, Public Speaking because Kozar is a riot and the people are awesome in there. And French is above all because it owns. Dont listen to "I love you, Not" by Homegrown. Its nothing but a flashback. Yeah all my entries are like I have ADD. Random Comment here, there. There everywhere. I'm thinking about everything wayy to much again. When that happens I start feeling sick. I feel sick. Why cant anything good ever happen to me? I think I've paid my dues. Something good hasta happen. You would think. You would also think wrong.  Yeah Im gonna go. I need to work on this gay template and figure stuff out.  I dont care anymore.

      Yeah today really sucked. First of all, I didnt get enough sleep last night. Plus I was stupid and took 3 advil before I layed down. That means I'll be sick for the rest of the week. Yay, for me.  "Mistakes are misleading, you shouldnt think what youre feeling.." Death Cab for Cutie - Lightness.  Wow. That has never been any clearer to me. I need to talk to Rachel. I talked to her for quite a while online. Yeah. Were both basically in the same boat. She will be very interested in what I hafta inform her of. Yay.  "He always enjoed being the bearer of bad news.."  Igby goes Down - Olie  Same here. Wow. Maybe you should call me Igby. Lmao! O yea!

      Yeah, I know I havent written in here since, forever. Alot has been going on. Well not that you could easily tell, with my lack of communication to the outside world. Yeah I have been thinking about lots of stuff. You know, that it is never good when I think about lots of things. Such an interesting frame of mind. I dont care anymore.  I wish that I could come right out and say everything that I have ever wanted, to whoever I wanted. Maybe all of this would then go away. Everywhere I go it seems that I unleash another memory. It has almost been 6 months and I still can't seem to get a grasp on anything. Like yesterday, I went to Best Buy to get 'Death cab for Cutie' because im in love with like 4 songs off of it, and when I walked down the cd aisle I passed this guy, and at that moment I got the largest wiff of axe from him. That brings back too many itself.  Last time I said anything about it to someone, I got relayed back to him. That's not gonna happen again. I watched the greatest film that I have ever seen in a long time last night. Its called 'Igby goes down.' Wowzers. It was so powerful. It has Kieran Culkin, who is, for those of you who dont put two and two together McCaulay Culkin's younger brother..the "Home Alone" kid. Yeah... Anyways the movie held to many truths to my own life that I dont want to go into detail about and bore you with, so i'll save you from that.  Ok, I in relation to what is going on in my head I have kinda reached some questions that I cant quite seem to answer because I dont have all of the answers.  If a person reaches a point of lonliness, does that person slowly start to forget about what made them sad in the first place? Like do they get to a point where its such a culmination of a million things that they forget who or what has caused it from the start?  I think I have. I dont know. Im gonna go. Maybies I can get the guys to come over tomarrow. I hope so. Its so boring when they dont come over. Especially in the winter because there is absolutly nothing to do.

      Crammed - Packed - Never - Ending - Weekend - Of - Mayhem. Wo0o0o.  Okay. I've got nothing to rant, nor rave about this weekend, so I guess I'll just describe to you what I did. That works.  Friday - Had early dismissal. Blah. Came home, ate, went online, and sat around until about 2:45. Then I went back to school so I could go to track practice. Yeah, I was there until about 4:30. Though, all we did was streches, blocks and 3/100's. Easy practice for Saturday. After when I came home, I did nothing, but sit around. Boring. Saturday - Got up at 7, because of my loud and ingnorant father who decided to be loud when he was getting ready for class woke me up. Left at 8:30, and stopped at the gerocry store so I could get some powerade ^_^'  continued up to the school where the bus left at 9:00, got to Austintown/Fitch at 9:30, ran the 100 in 19.5 seconds, and ran the 200 in 41.3 seconds (I could of been faster in both, damn blocks!!) I didn't get home from that until 4:30. So when I came home, I was in a really good mood, and I played a little volleyball, and sat around, until randomly Harry showed up in my house, soon followed by Dan and Ryan. Then, they ubducted me, and we went down to the school, so I could film Dan trying to do a ollie over a skateboard, on a skateboard in 13 takes >  While I was down there, I called back to my house to let my mom know where I was, and I asked her if I could spend the night. So I did, and we ended up sitting around playing the 007 game, which was being gay as hell, and Harry kept using my shoulder as a pillow, so we all ended up going to bed at like 2:30.  Sunday - Woke up at 9:30, and sat in the living room because no one else was up yet. When  everyone finally got up we all watched Weird Science (except Dan, because he was still sleeping, until he left at like 10:45) and then Dazed and Confused, I left around 1:30. Came home, ate something and did some shiz on the computer.  The guys showed up at my house at like 2:00 - ish, and then we walked to downtown Sharon, where we sat around for a few hours. Walked back to my house at 5 - ish, layed around for a hour or so, and attempted to play twister until my mom came home ><. Then, they left at 6:30 - ish. Since then I have been doing a combination of computer/cleaning/dinner/bath/alias. Yeah. Well Ima go. Alias comes on in 2 mins! Woo.

      Yeah, That's right. I really hate people.  I take that back. I only hate certian person/persons.  You guessed it ladies and gents. This calls for another round of 'Things that make Heather incredibly angry.'  Round 1! Okay. Sometimes people have more than friendship feelings for somebody else. Therefor, that person wants to get closer to the other person, for this instance we'll use 'victim' in refrence to the other person. . . Kay. At the same time the 'hunter' is hoping that the 'vicim' feels the same way. Now, normally, the 'vicim' would show this by a thing called massive flirting, more than norm contact (verbally and Physically) and by many other things. We like to call that leading the 'hunter' on. If any of you are not familiar with anything I have just been ranting about, I suggest locking yourself in your room, listing to mad amounts of emo, and if you are totally lost, call Ben. . .  Continuing. Now, there are circumstances,  when the 'vicim' is, how should I put this, socially retarded. Well, Ima put this into diffrent terms. There basically users. Gay friznucking assed users. ArGh! That makes me so mad. And if you dont know who I am talking about, I honestly dont think you have any right to be reading this.  Oh well. Im going to go, were all going over to Harry's and then to the buhl club for swimming.

      Yeah. It's been a while..again! Alright. It's not like I can ask you what you want to hear first the good news or the bad news. So, I'll give you the good first. (Plus, I dont actually have bad news, other than my life.)  Good Shiz: I get my permit in a month. Which is awesome! Yeah, cuz today is the 20th and my bday is October 20th. (keep that in mind) So next month is my 15 and a half cele! w00t!  Bad Shizncking Shiz: Nothing has really changed with me so far. Other than the fact I don't like a certian person that will remain unmentioned, because of the fact, I am not "outgoing" and I am a quiet person. *cough* So I'm just calling it quits on that little project. Well, last night at the mall with the guys, (Bob/Dan/Harry/Chris/Joe-ish Tonight's gonna be fun too! Were all heading over to Bob's house (same people) and watching a few good movies! Yay! I dunno when i'll be home, Im not heading over there until 5:30-ishel. It will be another late night event! But thats okies, because I don't have track in the morining. That is awesome. I def. need a day off. But I think they are comming over tomarrow. That will be cool too. I have so much fun when I am around them. Oh well. I gotta go. Im leaving in a little, have ppl to talk ta yets. I'll write later.

Im really tired. A-Kay. People are really starting to get on my last neve. I mean, people that I thought were my best friends, are randomly starting to hide things from me. What ever happened to telling people things. Not just any people or person, your friend. I mean, you guys know me. Im a layed back person. Im not one to over react about anything..well almost anything. I don't understand you people anymore.  I take that back. I don't understand you.  Yeah, you thought it was bad right? >Wrong. Bad only justifys the skin of things. If you want to save me, I'll be endebted to you forever.

Maybe it's because I don't wanna know.There's so many things that make everything so wrong. It's too hard to concentrate on them all. I wish I could just spill my heart out to some one, but I can't find anyone who would want to listen that hasn't hurd it all before. My life is one big block of cheese. It just sits there and let's the world take it's tole without fighting back. That is soooo not pimp. I need to loose weight and fast. I also need to run some for track before it actually starts. I have been lifting though, that way when I gotta throw, I have a arm. I don't know if I want to go to that ska concert now. I might, but I dunno. I havent been feeling the slightest bit of ska latley. That is definitly not pimp. Bah Humbug. If anyone would like to come and save me one of these days, I'd be more than happy to be saved. Ima go before I get you sad. Don't feel bad. No one does anywho.

      -Song- ''All we ever needed'' The Early November -Mood-  ..umm..cheese danishes..  Um, yeah. Today was really boring. You have no clue.  I'm reading this new series, it's pretty nifty. Called 'Jing: King of Bandits' Deals with a guy called Jing and his crow/assistant named Kir. It shows a bunch of diffrent things. Theres also pirates in it. That score's it about 10 points extra.  Deary me, I am so excited. Track starts next week, that means, I HAVE to go on a diet. I need to workout more. The only problem is, I don't have determination enough to stick to any solid routine. Bah.  I havent had pop in like, a week. That is awesome. Not really. I want some now.  No, I do not have chipmunk cheeks.  I wonder what it would look like if I wrote everything backwards.. sdrawkcab gnihtyreve etorw I fi ekil kool dluow ti tahw rednow I.. ^^ That was so nifty! You know what I hate? Well, theres alot of things, but let's zoom in on one.. I hate when people use me, and then try and pull it off like they did nothing. Argh. It makes me so mad. I dont care anymore. Not anymore. bah.

      Well. I had a good day of workin' out today. -Phew!- We did 10 grovers, and a 800 meter run (two laps) then we did 100 of backpedals, knee-highs and butt-kicks. Fun for the whole family. Im really glad I joined track this year, because I've lost alot of fat. I need to loose more though, so I can be less fat.

      -Sigh- I have no clue what is going to happen. You know, I thought I was at a perfect situation. I had plenty of people that I hung out with, I had very good grades, hell, I even made it on the honor roll with a 3.9 gpa. I ran in track, and each time I ran, I got better. What could be better? Honestly. But now, I don't know. I hate where I live, the people I've hung out with don't want to hang out with me, nor talk to me. My grades in some of my classes are starting to slip because I've been doing so much, I haven't the time to study and do all my homework. It seems as though all that has ment anything to me, is just slipping away. And, of coarse it had to happen right before summer vacation. Why?. This always happens. Can't I be happy? For more than a 8 or 9 month amount of time? Seriously.  I just don't know anymore. I don't know anything.  I need to go listen to more of The Early November. Then, I need to go to sleep, where I don't realize how shizzy things have gotten. .. Way away, away from here I'll be....

      -I have had it up to here. Go take your shiz somewhere else. -  Honestly folks. I can't stand any of you anymore. Well.. maybe some of you..but only a select few! Argh.  I dont feel like talking. No one cares. I need some sleep. Go have fun with your friends.

      You know what? - I can't stand this anymore. Why can't I say what I want to say? I want to sit everyone down, and tell them exactly what I feel, why I feel it. I don't want to just play around anymore. This sucks like a mother. I still don't feel like talking. Tomarrow is gonna be fun. O yeah. I get to do the 1600, 4 X 2 relay, the 200m dash, and the longjump. Great. Yeah, so I guess Im a distance runner now. That kinda sucks. But, it's okay.  Tomarrow will be fun. As long as I think that I've got nothing to loose..right? I hope so. I need to make a new mix for track. That way I've got stuff I can think of.  Saving me from all of this, would just be too much for you. Don't bother.

      Wow. That's all I can say is wow.  Sometimes people never fail to surprize me, even now.  If you spend enough time with a person, when it's just you and them, the person can turn out to be almost completly diffrent than they normally act around you. I definitly have a new respect for someone.  Yes, that's right folks. I have absolutly no courage. None. It's definitly not there.  But I'm also lacking major in the self-esteem, self-confidence, all of the above. Yeah. I think I might need to work on that in order to aproch the aproch-ee. Yeah, about that, I'm definitly not saying anything to anyone else. Word gets out. Easily.  I'm definitly going on a hour and a half of sleep. That's so not cool man. I didn't sleep until about 9 in the morning until about 10:30. But, for some odd reason I'm okay. I mean, I had the all day track meet @ East Palestine from 7:30 a.m. until almost 6:00 p.m. when I got home, then I walked down to Harry's hung out there, came home and got my clothes, went back down and hung out all night. And, I basically just got home. Sounds like loads of fun, right? Damn right it was fun. Wow. I bet you wern't expecting me to say that, were ya? Well. So what. I can't wait to talk to someone! Seriously!  When I wasn't talking to this person, he was always online. And now that I'm not, he's not on. Go figure. That's okay.  He's still talking to me.  Does that make me Mary? Wow. I hafta talk to Rachel Martin today. I have somethings to tell her, a few updates. It'll be gravy, and she'll be mad, then she'll be sad, and it won't be gravy anymore. It will suck. But that's okay, because that's what I'm here for! I listen to everyone's problems! I don't know why, I just do. I don't like to all the time, but I honestly can't be mean. I don't have it in me. I wish that I could be mean sometimes, just to know what it's like, then I'd want to turn back because I don't think that I could go that long with out cracking a joke, or being anti-mean.  Some people think I am mean already.  I don't think I'm mean.  You know what? I am so totally just rambling on and on and on and on in this entry it's crazy shiz pimp. That's right. I guess that's what happens when you get this little of sleep, worry about everything that's going to happen, are mad hungry and kinda bored out of your mind because there is no one here besides, me and the 'rents. It's amazing that I can go from never being allowed to do anything, to actually finding that I barley spend anytime at home. Not like that's a bad thing or anything, because it's all fun and games, but I do get tired after a while. Like riight now. I'm so freaking sleepy man. Oh well. It was fun. No regrets right? I think I need to stop worrying so much. That's not good. I think it might be making me go bald. Even though I'm not going bald. It might soon if I don't stop.  Im going to go, before I ramble on even more. Blah. See YOU on the flip to the dip side.

      Alright folks. Welcome to another addition of the special brodcasts from random people's homes!!  For  this lovley Saturday night, Im talking to you from Harry's house. Everyone is basically over, it's gonna be a party! w00t. Yeah, I had  that track meet this morning at like 7:30 til about 6-ish. That was so not fun! But, I didnt get as burned as I did last weekend. Thats a good thing. Im still in a crappy mood from last night. But Im kinda better now. I guess. But not like that matters. I dont care anymore.  I have the get up kids stuck in my head, I really want to talk to somebody in perticular, and I can't which makes me mad, but im not a home, so that makes me un-mad....just a little. Im gonna go. Prolly be back later.  Somebody Save me.

      I was thinking.  What is it about me that drives people away? I'm serious as all hell about this one too.  Is there something that I do that people dont like, and they just dont tell me about? If there is, you should let me know, because I hate feeling like this. Especially when I have no one to talk to, and I'm just stuck thinking about it forever. That's never a good thing.  I just don't know. I don't think I wanna know. Please don't tell me it's because I'm 'emo'. I've hurd enough of that to last me a lifetime and then some.  I'm going to bed. Track meet tomarrow morning @ 7:30 a.m. See you there.

      I realized something today. It doesn't matter what I do.  Nothing seems to matter. The world does not care what I do. Which completly screws with the concept of this journal it's self. Never the less. I'm sure a few of you get a joy out of reading this. It just hit me. Like that.

      Wow. That's all I'm saying kids, Wow. I love that show. I want to go back. I need to go back.  I need to listen to Mustard Plug and Big D.  Can anyone help a sista out? Of you do, I'll owe you big. And I mean big.

      Well Kids. Tonight is the big show.  Actually, it's not really big.  There's only four bands, Planet Smashers, Catch 22, Mustard Plug and Big D and the kids table. That's not that many. I miss Warped Tour.  I'm taking the guys up..too bad I don't think I'm taking god up. That would rock rock rock. If god graces me with his presence tonight, I'll be a happy girl. I'll also be a happy girl if I meet some new boys. That's right. Another song you kids need is "Long Goodnight," by the get up kids, and "I belive in a thing called love," by the darkness. Those are pretty nifty selections. I actually wanted to catch some sleep before we hit the road, but I don't know if I'll be able too. Ugh. This will be interesting. Esecially because I have a high hate-tred, for ska. Yes, I know. That makes no sense, and why am I going right? Well, put it too you this way, it's a show, and It's in Cleveland, only $10 and I'm going with the guys. I've never been to a show with them. This will be fun! .. I think .. If I don't die in the pit first.  I'm going to go, if anyone wants to come along tonight, your more than welcome. Just bring some powerade and all will be fine.

      This sucks, and like everything else in life, it is going to turn out bad. Because, I'm sorry to break it to you folks, luck just doesn't happen. Luck is man made. Luck is won over and bought just like everything else in this world. I hate what society has done to society. If you watch movies from era's like the 50's, 60's and such, they all look so comfortable. Comfortable with their friends, homes, and everything that was going on around them. Why can't it be like that now? If anyone can answer that for me, I'll owe it too you, because nothing good ever happens to me.

      I'm just plain tired kids. I've got no more motivation, no energy, and no expectations. If this isn't the low life, I don't know what is. I could really care less about writing in here today, but there's nothing else too do. I might see if the guys want to help me film. I don't know. Today isn't a good day. I need someone to come over. . .If anyone would like to save me, I will love you forever. I think. </3

      Hey folks. This is a special entry, cuz Im writing from my Aunt Kathy's house. Yesterday was so long and boring I don't even know where to start.  I ended up waking up at like 6:30 yesterday, and went to track at like 10. The meet was at Mineral Ridge. We were there until seven freaking oh clock.  Not to mention I also look like a freak, since harry injured my eye with the fake sword, and I got so sunburnt that I hurt. I really need to do some filming. I only have three days left to get my video done. Now, I really feel like a director. Seriously.  I want to watch the first season of Red vs. Blue. But. I've been so freaking busy it's not even funny.  I can't belive school is almost over. We only have like less than two months left. To me, that's both sad and great at the same time. I definitly cannot wait until I graduate. That way I can leave and move to New York City. If anyone else would like to tag along with me let me know.  I honestly dont know if I want to go to California. I mean, I do. I think it would be really fun. But I dont know. I know that I need to be alone and on my own for a while.  I don't see where that would differ from now. I mean, I'm honestly like never home anymore. I'm usually always either, at School, Track, or I'm at Harry's.  And usually if I am at home, the guys  always end up stopping over or something.  My mom thinks that its odd that I only have a few friends that are girls.  I don't know why I don't. I mean, yeah, there nice to talk to and all, but I barley have anything in common with any of them. The only girls Im really friends with are Rachel and Sarah. Well, there are others, but I don't ever talk to them or hang out with them outside of school. I wonder why they took off the show, where in the world is Carmen San Diego? I don't get that. I get to have pop now. But really, I don't  want it. I just don't.  It tastes really funny and I don't feel to good after it.  You all need to go listen to Muse. I love this band. There really awesome. I mean so awesomerific that I can't even hand gesture it enough to you!  If anyone has any tips on how to woo someone, let me know. I need them desperatly. Yes, that's right folks. I said desperatly.  Well, Im going to skidattle, because this internet is really gay (I love you dsl!) and I gotta get ready to go home.  Always.

      You know what? I hate everything about this. I can't stand it anymore. I really can't. Everytime I think thimgs maybe looking up, they pull a 180, and smack me right in the head.  I can't stand any of this anymore. Why do I have to sacrifice so much, for someone, to make them a better person, when it's most likly hurting me a hundred times more. I don't get it. Maybe I just don't want to get it.  I'm ready to move now. If I had some money, I'd buy a train, plane or bus ticket now, go to NYC and forget about all of this. Start out new. That's what I need to do. I can't keep going through this. If I do, I think, in time, my head will explode. Even though death itself isn't horrible, I don't think I want to be remembered as the human bomb.  I don't get anything anymore. Life isn't life anymore. It's a system of chores, that require no thought. All anything is. A system. That has too many faults. Maybe if I was cooler, and maybe if I talked more, maybe if I was pretty, people would like me too. (When I say people I mean guys.)  I don't know. I guess I just need to change something. Cuz this system I have going for myself, isn't doing anything for me. I don't feel like talking anymore. Im going to go.

      Yeah. Yeah.  I'd say today was a pretty good day. Nothing too exciting. Haha. Rachel Martin said something to Jon before I got a chance too. I guess it went a little something like this.. Rachel- So, How's Dan? Jon - ...Ookay I guess.. Rachel- So..How's Dan and Heather..? Jon - *ponders..* HEATHER? Rachel - Well, not yet, but uhh.. Jon - Dan's a fag.   Well, if that wasn't the best ice breaker I've ever seen.. or hurd I should say, ya know. That's great.  This summer's gonna be fun. Parties. Sleepovers. Parties. Lan Parties. Sleepover-ness. Shows-nessles. Oh yeah.  I dunno. I'm rambling now. I'm skidattle. Cheers!

      Confused? Yes. Worried? A little. Extreamly Happy? Definitly. I think it'd work. Even with all the doubt floating around.  I have so much freaking stuff to do. Crazy. I have to do three algebra assignments, two are due tomarrow. One is due on Wednesday. I have a Journal, Study Guides, and and Essay due through out the week, let alone the test on the gayest book in the world..'Of Mice and Men..' horrible. I can't read it without falling asleep. Argh. Things are slowly going to start improving though. I know it.  "I've seen the smiles fall to many times before, let me ask you is this what you've been waiting for?" Eep.

      Blah-diddle Blah Blah Blah. Today has been so boring. Seriously dude. I've done nothing but work on my PS speech and VA and then I had to finish reading 'Of Mice and Men.' I hate that book with a passion. Steinback may be a very respectable author, but where the hell did he come up with an idea for that book? Crazy Bastard. And on top of that, I have to write an essay which is due tuesday, on that book. It's so not fair. I can't even read 10 pages without dozing off, or falling asleep completly. Ugh.  I want to get the guys together, and go to chineese, and then to the movies. It sounds like some fun.  I can't wait until marching this summer. It's going to be so much freaking fun. I'm going to be so sad though, because Steph, Tj, Doc, Browning, all of them are going to be senior's next year. It's not fair. When the guy's grade goes, I'm going to be so screwed. Thats why I have to make the BEST of it now. haha. O yeah. Tomarrrow's gonna be fun. Eep. I'll write either later if I get bored, or tomarrow...Cheers'

      Today has definitly been the best day that I think I've had in quite a while. I mean seriously, I think if anything..well almost anything would have been any diffrent, then I don't think I would of had that great of a time.  I'm so happy. You know that feeling you get when someone likes you, and you like them, even though you're not together, it's still so much freaking fun?  Yeah, that's what I've got right now.  I definitly have gotten to know and hang out more with a certain someone. It kinda makes me sad to know that because of a certain person, I've missed out on knowing them all of this time. Maybe something would of happened earlier if I could of but all that shiz behind me earlier. Oh well. I'm not going to let it bother me..why? Because on the rare occasion that I can honestly say I'm happy..I don't want to miss any second of it. Yeah. I'm definitly going to go to sleep now. I'm so freaking tired. Cheers and Goodnight to ya all!

      This year has gone by really fast. Like really really ridiculously fast. It stil kinda feels like the first day of school. I don't know. Maybe thats just because I'm a big weird-ball. Who knows. Oo0. I might get to play piccolo in Marching Band. That's kinda cool. I'd rather be play drums, but hey, it's not a flute. I gotta go do the Relay for Life tonight. I'm glad I'm doing it. Not only for community service, but for Grandma, Uncle Russel, and Aunt Mary. I can't belive they've all past away in the last 9 months. All from the same thing too. Lung Cancer. I hate that..so don't even get me started... Tomarrow is the band trip!! I'm so freaking excited! Harry's not going to be there, which, I mean, yeah he's like one of my best friends and all, but uhh, yeah. This will definitly give me a break. And I'll be able to hang out with Dan, without having Harry all over me. That's cool. Yeah, if Jon is reading this because he clicked the link in my profile, please talk to your brother. Seriously. wth is up with that, ya know? Thaaaaanks. Well, I'm going to go. I wanna sleep a little or do some algbra..gawd. I'll prolly write more after R.F.L or Sunday. Cheers.

      Today was such a horrible day. You have absolutly no fucking clue. I all I could do was sit there and think about all the shiz that's been going on, some of the shiz that happend last night, and everything else. It definitly sucked. Dunno. Might see what the guys are doing, since I have nothing better to do. We'll see. Have fun folks.

      You know what, after spending the weekend alone, I've came to alot of conclusions. I've realized what I've got in life, what I thought I had in life, and what I need. It's almost disappointing, but at the same time, it's motivation to work towards all of that.  I found out who I don't want anymore.  I also realized I definitly need to stop living in the past. All that shiz that went down this past summer, is all that it is..the past. Nothing more. I'm honestly trying not to care anymore. Woah. Summertime self-real-eyes-ation at it's finest folks. Hope you all enjoy.

      Today has been a good day so far. I guess. I didn't go to track today, dad didnt let me. So, I went and took the test portion of my permit thing, and I passed that. I'm so happy. But I feel sick and I'm really hungry, so you wouldnt be able to tell if you saw me. Have I ever told you how much I love Ramen. I love ramen alot. Lot's and lot's. Yup. All-Righty. I think after we get done gerocery shopping, I'm going to see what the guys are up to. Then, maybe we can hangout or whatever. Dunno. I'll write later.

      It's 7:54 in the morning and im up because, last night, I went tanning, and I've ended up looking mildly like a lobster. I hurt so bad. Also, I have track in about an hour, and I'm feeling really nauseaus. Weather it's from the tanning thing, not getting a good nights sleep, or the medicine, because I am sick, I don't know. Last night, I do know, when I got up to put lotion on, I got really dizzy and felt like I did when I passed out that one time. And that's not good because I have alot of stuff to do today. I have to get the part B thing, go to the bank, put in app. at the golf coarse, and stop in at T-Mobile. Ughhh..So much to do. So little time. I'm glad though. I'ma get my yearbook on Monday. I've got to get some -people- to sign it. Man, I think I'ma be sick. Bah. O yeah, I definitly had the weirdest dream last night. Something about aliens, and a guy, and hubbard, and random kids, bible questions, french kids. I don't know. It was too much chaos for me so I just woke up. lmao. I don't want to do anything today. I feel so blah. Oh well. I don't think anyone cares. I'ma go step outside for a few. Maybe the fresh air will help me. Hoping. I'll write in here tonight.

      I've been trying to watch this World News stuff, okay. All you see, are the little Iraqi, and Palestinian kids, throwing stuff at our boys over there, and all I have to say, are where the hell are there parents. I mean seriously dude. If I lived over there, my mom or dad would be like, Hel-l-oh get your rear in gear and get in this house, the USA is marching around Mr. Roger's neighborhood, with a few MK-40's and gernades. It's not safe to play in the street at times like these.  I want to move to Cocoa Beach. I want to surf again. I miss it. Makes me so sad.  Today wasn't a good day. For some reason, I've just been very depressed. Maybe because I've been thinking about everything. Like when I see, a few people..it's not good for me ya kno. . .Well you don't know, because. Yeah.  Its seriously hot outside. It's curently 82 in my house and it's 6:26. That's crazy. It's only May. It should be like 65 or 75. Then it would be comfortable. This d00ds, is not comfortable. My mother is driving me crazy. I was like, oh hey, I'm home and none of my friends felt like caring about me tonight, so i guess I'll speak a few words to my mother. No. Never again. Ah. And she repeats herself over and over and over again. My head is going to explode. I swear she's my source of constant headache. It's going to be impossible to stay here all summer. I hope she knows that. I'm def. going to be living at Harry, Bob or Dan's house. I don't care whose. Just as long as it's not my own.  I need a hobby besides being online I think. I spend hours on end in front of this thing. Ah-mazing. I think I've rambled enough. God, she won't shut up. Help me. If anyone can save me tonight, I'll owe you something big. Promise.

      Bah. Today was a very interesting day. I missed fifth period today, which is a shame because I love that class more than any of my other classes. I love learning foreign languages. My dad's taking a summer spanish coarse this year, he's going to teach me how to do it. That will be really nifty. Then i'll be able to speak 3 languages by the time I'm 16. Awesome. You wanna know something? I'm really sick and tired of hearing about other people's problems. I mean, sometimes, if something happens, and they need someone to talk too, yeah of coarse I'm here for them. That's what friends doo. But when every single day, and it's the same problem, it gets really aggravating. Especially when the problem could have easily been avoided if they would have just payed attention in the first place. Why else do people make mistakes? . . . Just so other people can make them too and fall into the same hole? I don't think so.  I'm so glad tomarrow is Friday. Yay. I hope we don't have Saturday practice. I really really don't want to practice on the weekend. I've already got alot planned.  1.) Get part B done 2.) Put in app. at the golf coarse.  3.) Party somewhere.  I'm sure were all going to go spend the night at someone's house this weekend. It never fails. It's all good fun though don't get me wrong.  I think I'm going to go. I've got some french and algebra to get done. ya.

      Hey there lazy chair! I figured since they reformatted Blog, I needed to have a catchy phrase. Ya know. Tac-8 Meet is tomarrow, for all of you interested, the field events start at 4:30 and the running events start at 5:00 @ Newton Falls. So if you're in the area, it's gonna take you a while ta get there. I'm running in the ever-popular 200m Dash and the 400m Dash. It's kinda sad though. That means we only have one meet left, that we all get to participate in. Reginals arn't until Thursday of next week. But, I got my pah-stah and my gatorade with water on the side..so I should be fine and dandy. Welp. I'm going to go. Stizuff to do yet. I'ma write in here later. Because I feel like it.

      Yeah. Track rocks. ShinSplints suck.  Im in like unbeliveable pain, 24/7. It's crazy. Season is almost over, along with school. This freshman year has gone by so fast.  It's like it was yesterday I was just starting to hang out with the guys, and I was so self-concious around them. And everyone else for the matter of fact. Boy. I'm still self-concious, but I think that I do a good job hiding it from everyone, so atleast it doesnt seem like I am. I've also made a few good friends along the way. Lost some too. Thats some crazy shiz right there lemme tell you. I don't think I've really changed emotionally too much though. I'm still wah. All over the place. I'm really happy, or really sad. There's not much in between.  I really need to finish watching Evangelion. I loooooooooove that anime with all my heart. Seriously. All of it. Corey is totally awesome for letting me borrow all 13 tapes of it.  I'm still single. As always. Like that is ever going to change. I'm telling you, Im going to die an old and decreped old lady whose never ever been married. So sad. Arhgg. I'm going to go and see what the guys are up too, then, I can figure out what I'm going to do tonight. I can tell you one thing, I won't be home.  Saving me would be too much charity for the likes of you.

      Would it all be better if I wasn't here?  You know, just as I thought I had things figured out, they of coarse had to go ahead and change.  I thought I knew what I wanted, where I was going in life, what I was going to do in life. I guess when you get too comfortable with that kind of thing all hell must break loose. Because it surley is causing havoc now. I mean, why the hell do I even bother anymore. It leads me no where, and always seems to dissapoint me.  I thought that I would make my move, and maybe have a slight chance at being happy. Even if it was for a moment. You think that's going to happen now? Think again. Thought I was going to New York City when I graduated. Can't. Why because fucking colleges have decided to rob their students of funds, and make it extremly unaffordable to pay your way in. $43,185 a year. Believe it. And to top it all of, I just don't know anymore. Just a hint for you all, don't take tylenole thinking it will take away enough pain. Because it doesnt, and then it sucks. I would love to express all of this to 'the group' but how many tears can you shed until it gets too old. Seriously. I know they said I have to talk to them, because that is what we do, we talk. But heres a prime example of the old saying it's easier said than done. I've been like this for 15 (almost 16) years of my life. You'd think I'd be used to it by now. I almost am.  Maybe if I dressed up everyday, wittled away my fatness to nothing, and cared about absolutly nothing in the world, just maybe then I could be happy. Is it the pessimistic side of me that scares everyone away? No one has ever seen this side of me in person. This is what I keep to myself, and what i'd hate to put onto you guys because I don't think anyone needs to go thru exactly what I am going thru, because it's not their problems. I don't know what to do with myself anymore. I don't want to have to do anything for myself. I just want to be okay. I don't care if I'm uberly happy, but I don't want to be like this. I just don't want to care anymore, because I don't care. But theres that thing in the corner of my mind, thats like, no, you must care because it is your life. You know, you  guys don't see me like this. You don't see any of it. All you see is the happy go lucky girl that is cool to be around. If you knew I was like this from the start, would you still want to be around me? I'm not a basketcase though. If that's what you're wondering. I just have no one I feel safe enough spilling all this too. And I really must say I hate all of the phoney people who pretend to care about what Im going thru. Because I hope you know that I can tell. I can see it, and I know. Let me tell you something. That's not cool d00d. not cool at all. why can't I just be able to say all of this. is it really that hard. or is it just the fact I havent found the right person to say this all too. it kills me on the inside. it really does. and i could write it all out, exactly what im feeling. when it comes to saying it though, i can't. or when i do i mess it up and everyone gets pissed off at me because i'm horrible at words. you guys wonder why i don't tell you people anything. there you go. i think what it is, is that im just not good enough. i mean, im good enough to hang out with, and too listen to everyones problems. but im just not it. how do i get like this? is it my subconcious building and building until it can't hold all of this and it spills out into my normal state of conciousness. because not long ago, i was fine. only three more years. just three. then maybe i can find what it takes to be happy. maybe i can find someone who understands me. because right now the only person i find myself to be happy around, couldnt care less about me. and hes not who you think he is. i guess it always has to come down to this, because alas this is all ive got. just me, and everything that i think about because i can't do anything else but think of things. then why the hell am i here? I dont know but i am starting to think it would all be better if I wasn't here. atleast not in brookfield. not in ohio. maybe not in the united states itself.

      K, so I typed out a really really freaking long post today before I left, and my gay computer froze, so I had to reboot without saving. Sucks right? Yeah, I thought so too.  I st around for like the first half of the day. Yeah, fun for the whole family, it's assured. Then Me and Rach went to Jon's grad party for like an hour, I was kind of bummed that we had to leave before they played (they = ffb) but, I got my pic, and one of me and dan too. So I guess all was not lost.  Then after, I came over too Joo's, and met up with the gentlemen ( Harry, Bob, Joe and Ryan .. sadfully no dan.) Sheesh. Yeah, I'm still here. I actually got to spend the night for like once in a very long time. It's been like a week. Sucks!  The parents are stil being Nazi-ans. I swear it's all the mothers doing. If she's unhappy, she wants the rest of the known and free world to be unhappy right along with her. I can't wait til Dad starts his new job, that way he's home more in the afternoon ish. I swear, because of the habit of staying up until like 3am on the pc, I can't make it past like 12 with out a computer, Muse and water. I think I will die. Hold on. Okay. I just got really really depressed all of a sudden, I have no clue why. Maybe because this is what I do when I'm at home, and I'm always depressed there. I wish I wasn't. I think all of this is taking alot of me. I mean, I'm the mediator of the group. I listen to EVERYTHING thats going on with everybody, which I can't completly say that I dont like, because thats why Im here. But whenever I try to tell them my shiz, they always have to turn it into something about them. I hate that. And all the stuff between me and dan. Well I guess I should say lack of things that are going on between me and him. I like him so much, doesn't he realize this? I mean goodness. I hate it so bad. Great there making fun of me because im a vegetarian. what the heck. jeesh. I dont know anything anymore.  I wish I could have sometime alone. I guess not. OR atleast someone to talk to. I mean really talk too. But I dont have that either. Maybe I do need to move. Get away from everything. I'm too used to this pattern of things. I need change. If I had change, I would be okay I think. Maybe thats why I never kept friends for a long amount of time. Weird. Oh well. Maybe I think about all of this stuff way too much. That could be my problem. Then again, who knows? No one because everyone has their head wrapped around there own situation and there way to busy to listen to me. I dont care anymore. at all. Actually I do but heh, you guys sure as hell wouldnt know about that.

      I didn't do much yesterday. I'm supposed to go to The Aquabats and Planet Smashers show today up at the agora. I really freaking want to go. But everyone counted on me as a ride, when I told them not too because things were up in the air, so alas, we have no ride. Dad's working up on the roof, and Mom has to be to work tomarrow at like 5 in the morning. Damn I wish I could drive. I haven't even gotten out on the road yet, when I've had my permit for about two months now. Things are startng to make me aggrivated. Maybe I need a break from people. I think that's what it is. People depend on me too much. Don't ask why. I don't know why they would be like that with me.  I'm going to go find something to do. Maybe I'll play some stuff on my guitar. Yeah, that sounds good. I'ma go jam. outz!

      "From when I was very young it would always make me forget everything around from me and come into a very blissful, or simple, state. Throughout all my life it's been an escape from everything, and as you are in that process of escape you see all those layers peel away or all those things that imprison you in your life... To me that's the only thing that is me, everything else is down to evolution and where I was on the planet - I could have been anyone, and I'm trying to find the most basic, simplistic, form of what I am. I can relate to those moments in my life when I've been playing music - it's like music is my origin of symmetry."   Okay. Too much? I never know. It sums up what music means too me, because someone, who im not mentioning, doesnt get it.

       http://www.iliekmuse.now.nu/ ^ That has to be about the funniest thing I've seen all day. I suggest you check it out, you guys may not get the jokes though.  I don't know what I'm going to do today. The guys haven't called, so I might end up staying home the whole day. I need a big serving size meal of a life. Yeah.  I want to be in a band. OF coarse the 'band' we have now hasn't done anything, and at this rate, I don't think that we will be doing anything. The brother and Lilly came over today. Dunno. I didn't hang with them much. Bill and I are too quiet. Im gonna go. Find something to do. Maybe the guys will show up at the house.

      Post 111: Everyone see the video for 'Uno' by Muse? If you have you'll know what I'm talking about. I'm so happy, I finally got my album thing up for everyone too look at. I just need more pics now. But I've got some from 'Ska is Dead,' and I'm going to that concert on Monday, hopefully *Crosses Fingers* I really wanna see The Planet Smashers! w00t.  Tomarrow is a big birthday extravaganza, Rachel Martin's turning 14 and Maggey's turning 16. That's nifty. I wish I had a summer birthday. No, mine has to be in the cold and rainey fall. Damn October 20th.   Can't wait until I turn 16, it's like in 4 months and 9 days. Something like that. Oh well. I'm definintly going to have a sweet birthday party. Atleast I hope. Might have my party in the summer. That way we can actually party. Insted of freezing lumberjack-style on the deck. I wanna have a super killer pool party. For the Cool Kids at my school. wow. i gotcha there. i got cha. do you have cha? hee hee.  That's super rad my friend.  I'm gonna go, so I can go do..well nothing but. Yeah. Ima skidattle.

      I woke up at noon.  I feel like I need more sleep though.  Today's going to be boring, I can tell. I bet you any money that they won't call. Oh well. It bothers me, but I highly doubt they want to spend everyday with me. I don't know who would.  You know, it's only June 9th, and I'm already bored. Psh. This is going to be one long summer. Wonder when there going to Kansas. Need to find that out. Maybe me and someone can spend some good time together. Sounds like a plan. =). I don't know why I try so hard. I just do. I'd like to think I'm getting somewhere. Doubt it though.  I'm gonna go. Gotta find something to do. Cheers.  btw - Happy BDay Bells!

      Up past 2 again. Sitting here, thinking way too much. I wish I didn't worry about everything the way I do. I don't know what to do about anything anymore. I try so hard, to make things go the way they should.   "and no reason why i should try to go on anymore my reason's all gone, no reason why you should try to make excuses to make me feel alright excuses call for stupid reasons and i know that it's not much that i can offer right now just give me one little second and i will try my hardest to make you feel like i'm someone else." - Pretty, Pretty. T.E.N  Understand why I love that band. I don't want anyone to think I'm something I'm not. Or that Im a certain way that I'm not. I can't help it though. You people don't want to see me sad or depressed. I'm such a person pleaser, and I'm that in a way that I don't want people to get worried, or upset over me or something that someone else did. It's not fair to them. At the same time, it's not fair to me.  Why can't people just not rely on me too feel better. I hate this. I'm going to bed.

      It's over already? I guess time fly's when you're having fun. Or not.. Yesterday was so much fun! Atleast for the first part. All I had to do was take the World History exam, then I was done. I passed it with a 97%. I'm happy. Then I walked to Joo's house and met up with him, Harry, Bob and Maggey. Yeah Dan came later. So we all hung out, Maggey left at like half - past noon-ish. Then we all just kinda sat around, trampoline, watched Bob play starcraft, a few movies, ect. Yeah. Then I called my mom and asked her if I could spend the night, so of coarse she was like, "Yeah of coarse." So she came and got me, and on the way to the house to pick stuff up for later, she was like, im seriously debating about leaving your father, and im going to look for an apartment in Niles, and ect. all while I was going to leave in a half hour to meet up with the guys. Right. So I didn't let it bother me. Then, my dad called, and was like, flipping out on me. He was like, I didnt raise you for 16 years to just run all the damn time, and you're being such a dissapointment, and blah blah blah. It didn't help, I could of probably told you and made a bet on the fact that he was drinking previously to this, as he always seems to do, every single fucking night, it never ends. I always thought he was the one I could stand the most, now, Im beginning to take it all back. Of coarse I was outside when I was talking to him, they were watching TV inside, so I was being polite. And the only person in the world who could make me cry in an instant decided to flip the fuck out on me, while I was at Joo's house. So of coarse Harry had came out too see what was wrong. I was sitting by the tiki-tourches that me and Dan had set up and  I was all like, im not going to let it get to me, Ima keep it all bottled up, but I think I had been doing that for too long because as soon as he went to give me a hug, I lost it. That's the first time I really ever let anyone see me cry, let alone comfort me. I'm really glad they were there though. Because if they werent, who knows what might of happened. So then, we went inside after like a half hour of crying and comforting, and then me bob and harry all sat down and talked for a while, which helped so freaking much. I never knew people actually cared about me. They were all worried. Why? I didn't think that I could mean anything to anybody. I guess I do. Learn something new everyday don't we? Yeah. Yesterday was quite the rollercoaster ride of emotions and events. Eep! I'll prolly end up writing later, if the mother and father arn't yelling at each other again, which I have a feeling they will, just because, they shouldn't be in the same room together. Someone save me..

      I don't know what i'm doing anymore. I really like him, I mean I really do, but am I just kidding myself? Is it actually capeable that the kid I like, likes me just the same, but also has the same mentality as i do when it comes to getting up the guts to making the first step? Could it honestly be possible?  You know, tomarrow is the last day of school. And it doesnt feel like it. At all. It feels like the middle of the year. On top of that, things have been happening, and shiz has been going down that make me want to explode. Why I constantly put up with it all is literally beyond me. I bet you anyone else in my shoes would of had a nervous break down by now.  I might loose a brother, that I never really got to know. Yeah, cuz the dummy signed up for the army a few years ago, and when Lilly came along, they put him in the reserves. Dont you know that the reserves are being called out? His group has already been activated. That scares the crap out of me. I don't want him to go. He has a kid he has to raise. He's got me, his only sister and brothers to be around. It's all too much.  And I still have one more final to go. People make too much out of nothing, and some don't make enough out of anything. This worlds a crazy place, and my mind has decided to run at it's own pace. Why can't I be the one as the center of attention?  It's not fair for me to have to fight for everything, when I've got nothing to show. Am I not fighting hard enough? Or am I just going to be alone for the rest of my life? I don't care anymore. At all. I don't fucking care.  You people don't care about what you put me through, you don't care about what I'm put through, you don't care at all. So you know what, it's time for a change.

      Interessant.  Today was the first day of finals. Whoopty-Doo. I finished my Algebra, and took the first part of my french today. It was alright. Easier than I thought. Which is good. I'm definitly not complaining. After, I left and met up with Chris and Harry at the gazeebo, sat around for a while there. Then, chris left and we decided that we were going to go and kidnap Dan. So, we went and sat under the big tree in the practice field and read, it was soo nice out! Then we commandeered him, went to Joe's, had a water fight, on a trampoline, and then I came home.   I only wished.   You know, I wish that I would have more guts, too get up the nerve sometime. It never happens. I don't think he will ever either. But if he really wants something to begin between us, I'm hoping he would say something.  Tomarrows a long day, I have Science Final, 2nd part of Francaise, and English. Yay! .. not. I get out after 2nd period on Thursday though! Last day of school! w00t!

      Yeah, I went and saw it with the gentlemen today. That was great. We went to the mall before for a while, walked over to the theater, and then we all recriuted back to Bob's house after.  The movie had some very nicely done effects and fight scenes. A few dry spots, and some questionable things. Like, where does his web shoot too, when theres nothing around him? - Confusing? I know.  Not sure what I'm doing tomarrow. I'm sure I'll be wherever they are though. Wanna know something? I don't think that I have ever been home one day completly this summer. That's okay though. I love spending time with them. Even when there's nothing to do and we just sit there making up stupid stuff. That's the best.  I hope I get some sort of a response from him soon. I'm so nervous and so confused all at the same time. But hey, that's okay. Maybe it's a good thing he's thinking about it. So, I'm not quite complaining just yet.  Well, even though I have nothing to do, I'm gonna go. I'm tired.   - I'll probably write in here laterz!

I figured that since I had a blog, and it was really depressing evertime I would go to write in it, I would make a new blog, that would be happy! So here it goes..  Yeah, since I didnt get much sleep Friday night, because we decided to be stupid and stay up all night, and I didn't go to bed last night until 3, I was so freaking tired today. Plus, Dad woke me up at 9:45 to go to breakfast with Aunt Kat, Uncle Tom and Grandpa. That was fun. I got to drive home too so that was cool. Then I went shopping with Dad for a while, after that I went to Joe's house and met up with him, Harry and Ryan. I was hoping Dan would be there, since I need to conversize with him. But he wasnt. So Yeah. I have nothing to really say since this isn't a bad mood blogger.  haha.   I'll writecha latah!

       Wow, I' m so proud of the Blogger people.    They've finally let us edit how we want our font to look. And to that I'll applaude them.    Last night I went out to eat with the family, and the Aunt and Uncleness. That was great fun.    Made me sad that I couldn't watch any of my videos last night since they lack the capeablities of DSL. I would hate the be them.    I went to the movies none the less today though. Went and saw 'Mean Girls.' It was actually a very good movie. It really shows the truths of teenage labling, and things like that. Though at some points it was quite exaggerated, but I think the whole point of films of that mannor, would be to make it dramatic.    I started to read, 'Brave New World,' by Huxley. Very good. It makes you think, yes I mean MAKES! Because in the book you have to learn everything that is going on. Since it is about genomes, stem cell cloning and human harvesting, and it was written in 1932.    Almost sad is what it is. I mean, we just cloned the first human being last year, but a single man wrote a whole novel on it, basically explaining the process back in the thirties.    I also (finally) picked up the book, 'Rule by Secrecy,' by Jim Marrs. I was so excited. I've wanted to sit down and read that book for a while now. It's basically about conspiracies, diffrent groups, truths about mass media, and things of that mannor.    It will be a good read.    Marching band starts in almost a week, more like eight days, and my Muse concert is in 18 days. So freaking excited. Its going to be the highlight of my summer by far.    Oh well. I guess that's all I have to say for now. Maybe i'll write later. Not sure though.

      Music: Darude - 'Sandstorm' vs. Robert Miles - 'Children'   I didn't do anything today.   Some stuff that people said made me rethink everything. I hate when that happens.  Nobody ever comments in this thing.  Besides Cups, so to you, I thank.  I miss talking to a few people. I'm glad I started to talk to a few again.  So I'm going to go.

      Music: Muse - "Falling Away With You"   I was talking to a couple of old friends today.  I hurd them talk about what they did yesterday, about how they get up and go to church every Sunday morning. How bizzare.  Ideas like that are just bizzare to me.  How can so many people have that much dedication to one thing, for so long?  Now, I can understand having dedication in something like that if it was say, marraige, school something along those lines but with that, it's always something new, bold and interesting.  Doesn't the church feed you the same stories that you've probably hurd since you we're a child?  I'm sorry, but repeditiveness is one of my ultimate pet peeves.   I don't exactly write off the theory of a 'greater power,' so to say, but I can't agree with something that can't give me explanation and facts. I'd rather have nothing to believe in than believe in something I can't rely on and prove.   The other thought, is the thought of having someone have control of your life. I know that you say "he doesn't control it, he just gives you options." To me it sounds too much like a buisness. And I don't want someone else to have control of anything. I've always been told, 'I'm my own person, no one can dictate me.' So I'd sure as hell like to live it that way.   Another thing, not too far off subject, but not exactly about the 'Evolution,' objection and what not, is the question of the end of the world.  The Apocalypse as it where.   Have you ever woken up, in the middle of the night, when it's pitch black, and not realizing it's only 3-ish and you thought the world was over? What would you do in the last few moments? For the brief moment of confusion, I get paniced. I realized that I haven't said half of the things I wish I would of, and that I haven't did half the things I would of liked to. But I know that in the few moments left, I could'nt get half of those accomplished. Thus, feeling regret, and sorrow. I think that's what scares me.   I'm not scared of the Apocalypse or dying for that fact. I'm scared of not doing the things I need to do, or say the things I need to say.   Thats enough of my deep thoughts for you, for now.  I'm sure I'll be back later with more.

      Music: 'Zanzibar' - Suburban Legends         'Falling without you' - Muse So.  Today wasn't so grand.  I found out that laying down on my floor, and setting the fan right in front of me on high, with all the lights off and curtians closed, listening to Muse is very relaxing. I spent most of my day doing that today. Tomarrow, I'm gonna head up to the Grove City Outlets, and do some shopping with the auntness. That should be fun.  Im so bored, and tired of this vacation crap.  I just want school to start up again. That way I don't have days like these where I just sit around and do absolutly nothing. Besides think.

      Ugh.  Today was a boring day. Little to do.  All I've done, was walk down to Harry's, where I stayed for maybe three hours and watched them play Kingdom Hearts. A beautifully made game (art wise) but a bore to sit and watch. So I left.  Still no word.  That kind of thing irritates me.  But oh well. We all can't be choosers, now can we?  Or just not me.  If I find more to detail you about, I'll make sure to write later. But don't get to hopefull.

      Haven't done anything today. Yeah, I sat around infront of the pc and wrote somethings. Rather than that and cleaning up the house a bit I've just been here.  Todays an oddish day.  Hopefully this feeling will pass by tomarrow. If it doesn't then I'll probably be worse off. I'm still extremly excited about seeing Muse, live in 27 days! That's going to be the highlight of the year by far. Especially, since it's a festivle, they most likley have a meet and greet tent out. Meaning I get to meet him. But enough of that.

      Well I spent the night over at Harry's house last night with the gentlemen. Didn't do much, played videogames, DDR, watched some anime. That was about it. Though we did walk to chinese earlier, so that was good fun. I still have no word about that letter. No one has. Kind of upsets me, but there are signs of hope.  Since Sarah had to pull out on me for Warped Tour, it's gonna be just me and pops at the annual summer concert of the year. And because he still has back troubles, he asked me if I could look at another show. So I found one. A damn good one at that. I found the Curosia Festivle with -The Cure -MUSE! -Thursday -Auf Der Maur! -Interpool -The Rapture -Mogwai -The Cooper Temple Clause.  That means, me..live and in the flesh, get to watch, and meet,  (because I will NOT leave that show without meeting him) Matthew Bellamy play infront of my very eyes! Holy Crap! That will be so freaking amazing, I might just die. He's my ideal guitar-master, and has the BEST voice I have ever hurd..out of all of the other amazing singers like, Ace Enders, Brandon Boyd, and Matt Smasher. Matthew tops them all.  Its going to be like woah. But the tix are expensive. So hopefully that will be a striking iniciative for Dad to help me in my persue of meeting him. Like I said. I won't leave until I have an autograph and a picture! hehe. It's only fair tho! At this point, I don't care about not going to Warped. So for those who were maybe looking at going with me, sorry, but Muse is definitly worth it to blow off warped for.

      Well today was a fun, but long day! Came home from Aunt Kat's house around 9:30 this morning, got changed, then Rachelness came and picked me up at a little after 10. Went to Mary's house, got party supplies, opened my present (Thanks ladies!) then we coo-bye-yah-ed down to Jenna's and started setting up in her cabin. Made many trips back and fourth. Yeah.  She was so surprised, and the cabin looked cool! Hehe, we dressed up in her little sisters play clothes, that were like, sparkley non fitting items, and went to the movie store and Pizza Hut, waved to people and got some interesting looks. O yeah, and she's getting an underground pool, oh my goodness, she has some nice looking workers! (The shell necklace guy!!)  Yea, over all between the eating of icing, the cake..me almost getting killed by Rachel, and humiliating myself in front of people..it was a good day. Catch you on the DL!!

      I woke up to the 'rents fighting. Then Aunt Kathy called and rescued me to her house.  Mom followed. > I swam with Emma and Noah for 6 hours.  I think I have chlorine poisoning because I don't feel good and my ears hurt. I came home, and they faught some more. So I sat in my room listing to Muse for a few hours. Then ventured out into the living room to go online.  I don't know where mom is.  Hm.  Tomarrow will probably be quite interesting.

      Goodness! I have had nothing to do, this whole day. Seriously, I went online for a few hours, called Bob, because all of the gentlemen were over there and found out that they were all leaving in a little bit anywho. So I stayed home the whole dang day. Fell asleep though around 2:45 until almost 6. I was quite sleepy. I'm really hoping that tomarrow will be better. But who knows what everyone is doing.  As of now I'm going to Warped Tour with just my Dad, which will suck for him, because I go into the pits, and I don't think he can. Meaning I'll have to leave him alone for most of the time that were there. That is so going to be boring for him. Maybe I can find someone to tag along. Because Sarah was supposed to go with me, until she found out she has driving and danceline that day. So I'm going alone.  Marching band starts in less than a month. 26 days to be exact. Oh, joy.  I'm guessing that I'll type more tonight. The boredom is effecting my communication skills. Ba.

      Okay,  so I found the magical wonders of xanga, and I must say, they've won me over. But I know some of you kids out there read this thing, so for the hell of it, I'll update.  So Cups, this one's for you. I think I'll start by giving you the expo on wensday, since it was rad and I heart it.  We left the house at 3:30 and go there at almost exactly 5. It was down at Blossom which was really nice. Then I found out I couldn't of taken in my camera because they don't allow it. And because it was pouring we had to take raincoats. (Yeah, it stopped raining about 20 mins afer we got in.) Then we watched Auf Der Maur. The lead, Melissa is the ex-bassist for the Smashing Pumpkins. Who,  in her age still rocked like a mother. I couldn't believe how rad she was. She is now my vanilla!  Then we watched Thursday, who is amazing live. Didn't expect that great of a job by them at all. Plus it was the last day of the tour for them, and they we're filming a rock movie called 'God's Lot,' (btw, second stage was in a parking lot.) After that (when everyone else left for a while) I stopped by and talked to him, Geoff, (lead of Thursday) for a good half hour. He's such a sweetheart, it's great how he listened to me. I wish I had more people like that around me more often. Gave me some good words of wisdom. Then came Muse. Oh dear dear me. I was so bloddy excited for them to come out. Okay so the stage wasn't more than the width of a classroom. Maybe a tad bit more. And where I was standing I was right on the baracade, and I was in front of Matt. Who I could easily drool over, let alone sweaty and with a rad guitar.  So they played, Hysteria, New Born, Butterflies and Hurricanes, The Small Print and Stockholm Syndrome. I was a bit dissapointed because I didn't get to hear 'Plug in Baby,' so what I did, was I yelled it really loud, as they were still on stage, and then the group of about 10 forigners screamed out was sounded like, "Ploog En Bah-bay" but it was just there accent. It was still great. So they stopped, looked at each other, and came back on, and played it. I was so happy. Oh yeah, after Stockholm Syndrome, and after the riff thing they played after,  Matt was on the ground right in front of me, so when he stood up he was like, 'hugs for everyone,' and so I gave him a big hug, and kissed him on the cheek! (you only live once right?) and then he looked down at me, and was like, 'alright then,' and gave me a kiss back! I thought I was going to die. but I didn't! Then we decided to catch The Cure, who by all means suck live. Its like all stoner/elevator music. Horrible. So we left after the first 2 or 3 songs. It was like, 10:30 by the time we got out, and we wanted dinner, so we went to Denny's where we ended up running into Melissa from Auf Der Maur, talked to her for like 10 mins. then ate, and came home. Sound great? Yes! It was!
