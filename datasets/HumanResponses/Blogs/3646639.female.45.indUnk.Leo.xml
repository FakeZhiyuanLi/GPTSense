      A wave of self-pity; ugly thing, that is.  The feeling of being smothered by someone else's needs; everyone else's needs.  My children need me until they are older; of that I have no doubt; I do not question this.  But when he comes home telling me that his therapist thinks it would be a great thing financially speaking if we could live separate lives in the same home, I want to scream; at him, and at her.  Oh that sounds just hunky dory, doesn't it?  Pardon me, but while you're thinking how marvelous that would be, have you bothered to even  momentarily  think that there is someone else involved in the scenario?  What if ... suppose ... I don't  want  to share a living space with him for the rest of my life?  It's okay; she's not the first to mention this.  Rose herself brought it up once ... as in "When the kids leave home ... maybe the two of you could ..."  It feels so defeating.  It feels just like suffocation.  Of my spirit; my dreams, my hopes; the truth of myself and who I am and what I want for myself, for my life.  I want to scream  Doesn't anybody get it?  I don't love this man more than as a friend!  I can't stand living with him!  I need one day to have a home; I want it with Rose; I'll take it by myself if I have to, but I can't stand the idea of living the rest of my life with this man!   Well, there.  I've had my scream.  And I know that no matter what anyone says ... if I'm crazy as a loon ... I know that I must carry on in the firm belief that I will one day lead a life beyond and outside of these circumstances of the present.  Otherwise ... well, what's the point of anything, really?  I have wants and needs.  I can't get those met in this situation.  So I need to move on from this situation as soon as the time is right for me to do so.  It will come.  It has to come.  I don't want to exist; I don't want, as a friend said recently, to "spend my days"; I want to live and exult in the living; learn all there is for me to learn; love and be loved in all my days.  I do what I can now; I find a place to go in my head ... on the bus, late in the evenings and early in the mornings, my imagination takes me where I belong.  Someday my whole self will be there for more than a couple of weeks at a time.

      Let's keep the effusive outpourings down for a while, a time, dear.  Anyone who cares to look will find ample evidence of the impact she has had on your life, your heart and soul and mind ... all of you.  Now.  You are voracious in your appetites.  You have the potential to become addicted to just about anything (or anyone) you like, let alone someone who evokes all the good things within you in a way very different from yet equal to your children, your offspring.  So tread with vigilant care, good woman.  Make no claim to anything that isn't yours to claim.  Go lightly; be soft.  Keep your voice low and your presence gentle.  The world is full of observations to be made, tasks to be tackled, information to be absorbed, learning to be discovered.  There are thoughts; philosophies; histories; visions.  There is a nation to be restored to its truth and its rights and its youthful wayward fresh dignity.  So let's lay off the gushing confessions of a besotted soul's late discovery of just how true some phrases that once seemed trite really are.  Get on with the tasks at hand, and see the generosity in the lush gardens so quietly displaying themselves in the least expected place.  The bridge; the river.  How cobblestones are such a surprising delight to walk on (don't continue on to describe the best companion for walking there).  There you go again.  Hush.  Save it for your dreams.  Build wonders with it to bring to her when you come, but ...  Again:  hush.

      Once more, Rose does it.  She fills my heart with joy and hope.  Just a mention of going out to dinner six weeks from now and I am smiling like a besotted fool.  I suppose I am that, but I don't mind.  From the very first moment I became aware of her, she has had that effect on me.  It's quite amazing, and I can't think of anyone else who ever has.  I've had crushes, I've been enthralled by people.  But no one before has ever simply made my heart feel truly as though it were a winged and strong and glorious thing.  There is this enormous difference in a day when I get some word, any communication from her, and a day without it.  Oh I censor myself something awful.  I think ... am I codependent?  Am I too needy?  I don't want to be a burden to her, and it can't be fair of me to feel this tremendous difference so deeply.  But ... I do.  I try not to let on too often.  I mean, there is a lot of distance between us physically, geographically, and she seems not to mind that much.  Then again, I think ... maybe it's best this way, seeing each other for 22 days out of the year.  I mean, she won't get too tired of me too soon then, right?  I'm quite sure I'd bore her to tears if we were together every day.  I doubt I could ever get bored by her.  I have called her my soulmate.  I think that is very arrogant of me.  To be her soulmate, of course, is something I devoutly want to be, and yet I doubt I have the soul for it.  I feel as though she fills in a world of missing things in me, things that work better and make more sense with her than without her.  Then again ... I read once, in something she wrote about herself, that she had found her soulmate.  I know that person believes the same thing.  So I think my goodness, I just want to be a soul that could be mated with hers.  Her soul is the most amazingly beautiful and loving I have ever encountered.  She is so quiet and careful.  There is so much that lies within that I need to know.  Twenty-two days a year isn't enough time; we need years together.  I know it seems impossible for us to have that, but I have to believe that there is a way.  I need to work toward a time when those years ... or at least many, many more days in each year ... can be spent together.  I used to get snarly when I would read someone writing about how someone was her/his oxygen ... the air s/he breathed.  I now know exactly what they meant.  Still I try not to let on too often.  Well, she knows she has all my love.  All my love is something three people in this world have.  Other people have some of it; a couple have much of it.  But all of my love goes out from me to only three people.  Two of them came from my body.  One of them is connected to my soul; always has been, always will be.  To think, I lived 42 years without knowing her.  To think, that though our lives are lived an ocean apart, I have come to know her.  A miraculous gift; a frustration; a dream of hope.

      Odd how Rose's voice can pick me up no matter what we talk about:  kitchen appliances, bad moods induced by bad weather and the world's insanity.  I got to hear her voice this morning, and my spirit felt so much better, although now, in the middle of the afternoon, my body and head are suddenly heavy and tired.  They keep this office too cold.  Way too cold.  Freezer locker cold.  I must see if I can't pick up an old sweater at a thrift shop this weekend.  I am writing a story.  I might just need to suffocate within my current circumstances before I can escape them (sounds melodramatic but sometimes it feels that way); but my character doesn't.  She can get on a train away from everything.  And build a new life for herself far from the things that would bind her in the wrong place.  I think my heroines will find their rainbows in unexpected ways and places.

      Recently, I have come to the conclusion (as I scribble away about all sorts of stuff that strikes me as vacuous) that it is time for me to take a break from posting every bit of vocabularic (I have no idea; I like it, I'm using it) drivel that issues from my pen.  My situation is not grand; and it is glorious.  However ...  I believe that for the next little while, I need to concentrate on tasks at hand.  The mundane things I so abhor, but that need and deserve my attention.  One thing is my job; doing the work in front of me.  Then there is my disaster area of a home.  There are four people living there.  Two need to be taught how to clean things, and why it is so important to do so.  One is beyond help, and not my responsibility to train either.  I will leave this household in a few years; before I do, I need the junior members to have the knowledge and awareness they haven't got now.  The senior member is on his own.  I wish him well, but ... I have other places to go, other things to pursue in my life.  Cast of characters?  Let's see.  There's me (first person singular should suffice there): a woman in her 40s. There is Rose: the woman I love, my soul mate, who happens to live a great distance from where I live.  Our meeting, in all its miraculousness and frustration, is attributable to the Information Superhighway, if you will.  Even if you won't. Jerry:  Why not name him that?  My husband, the father of our children, a man who I married because he was literally falling over himself in love with me.  It was a mistake in some important ways, and not a mistake because of two supremely important reasons: Alexandra (yeah, cool name):  13, oldest child, temperamental and intense and foolish, not unlike many teenagers. Andrew (once upon a time would have been the real name):  10, youngest child, outgoing, friendly, a feckless charmer of a lad to whom good things come easily just as they flow from him easily.  Various and sundry other people will come and go, named as they appear.  None of the names are real; I think it's best that way.  Maybe ... just maybe ... I will keep this journal simple and clean.  I'll do my best.

      Never mind hackers and other evil entities in cyberspace.  Never mind the slings and arrows of internet idiocy.  I wonder what I might do with a fresh start and more anonymity than I am able to maintain in another place, where in the rush of newly arriving in the Land of Online I ran madly about, making "friends."  It is nearly impossible, I think, for most human beings to present themselves honestly.  It seems to me that most people are either grandiose or self-deprecating.  I tend to both extremes myself, and no; I have never been diagnosed with bipolar disorder.  Just now, what I wonder is how honest and simple a record I might manage to keep.  This seems like as good a place as any to try that out.  With all names changed to protect the innocent, the guilty, and all those gorgeous shades of gray between.

           Category IV - The Musketeer    You have a small, highly edited social group, and you like it that way.   urlLink  What Type of Social Entity are You?    brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Okay, I don't like worrying that Rose will throw me over. But I do. I wrote an email to a mailing list to which I belong. I got an offer that is very kind, but I don't feel I can take, having to do with when I am in Belfast. I mentioned hoping to visit a man's grave, and his niece ... well, someone saying she is his niece ... has kindly sent me an email offering to take me there. As kind as this is, things being the way they are, I am fairly sure Rose won't be glad, glad, glad about this.  Oh, I wouldn't take back my post for anything; I wrote it from the heart, and am quite comfortable about what I wrote. I just ... wasn't expecting this, and then I think Rose might be cross with me for writing anything on the topic. Life can be too complicated for me.  Am I dangerous?  Am I crazy?  All I did was answer in response to something I read which was so well written in response to something else, also well written but that I didn't like, calling a singer to task for singing at someone's funeral. Who should take a singer to task for singing at the funeral of a friend? Surely not her fans. It just isn't their/our place or function. Gack ... I feel all of about 16. Again.  I need to get some sleep. Then maybe all this won't seem so very serious. Well ... the tint of fear will stay until I hear from Rose. I've asked her for advice on how to answer the email. Oh well. Being me has consequences, I suppose; and I need to see what those are.  I just want to go over there and see her and spend time with her. That's all. Just that; no more. The rest of the things I do and see while I am there will be all so wonderful, bonuses.  Well ... I hope. I just ... hope. Hope, dream; these are the things I do. I do them well. I feel sad. I feel tired, too. I hope I can sleep tonight; I really, really hope so. Then maybe things won't seem to loom so dark and threatening. I can only ... yep.

      Well all right, so a friend just got an email that should probably have just been typed here, but ... well, I check my email first thing when I get home, so ... she got the whole story.  Ninety-five percent of the time I love my job.&nbsp; That is about the percentage of the time my boss doesn't bother me; heck, sometimes we even get along.&nbsp; But ... the other five percent of the time, it's sheer hell.&nbsp; He's sheer hell.&nbsp; Not a devil, although with his increasingly right wing political bent he might be one of those as well, but ... dealing with him when he has something bugging him is ghastly.  It doesn't matter that I know I've done nothing wrong.&nbsp; It doesn't matter that I have a plan to get well ahead with my work before I leave on vacation two weeks from tomorrow, and that I am executing that plan just fine.&nbsp; None of that matters when he has decided he is going to be miserable about stuff.&nbsp; I should have taken it as a warning when people told me that on Monday they heard my coworker yelling at him (she can do that; she's the only one who can, but she's really, really good at it so that's fine).  Then I couldn't even have a little phone conversation with Rose because the atmosphere was thick with his general displeasure at something nameless but looming somehow over my head.&nbsp; I think it was because the above mentioned coworker was working at home; my other coworker is off on vacation; and there I was.&nbsp; Yep; just me, the only shmuck caught in the office on this day of his bleak mood.  Vent, vent, vent,&nbsp; Bitch, moan, complain.&nbsp; I can't wait for these two weeks to be over.

       This weekend has been taken up with the busy plans and comings and goings of youth.&nbsp; They drag me along sometimes because ... well, I think it's just because they need to have a mom around for some things.&nbsp; I really like this friendship I see forming between my daughter and the brightest young woman I know in this neighborhood.&nbsp; Most of the other girls their age don't "like" this young woman.&nbsp; She has never been untrue to herself or compromised her own values in order to gain acceptance among the larger group.&nbsp; There is no better person for my daughter to be with or learn from; I only hope she chooses to do so.&nbsp; Since she was seven she has been so desperate for social acceptance.&nbsp; She hasn't ever gone so far as to betray her principles, but she hasn't been anywhere near the person she could be.&nbsp; I hope this friendship helps her toward that.    &nbsp;  I hope that my living by my own lights more and more each day helps her to grow into the woman she is, not someone who compromises herself into the shadows.    &nbsp;  Of course, que sera sera ... what will be will be.

      It was a hard and very long day.  A load of work; I didn't leave the office until 10 hours after I'd arrived there.  No word from Rose since Monday; I know she will make some attempt to get word to me before they go away for the weekend on Friday.  Someone said today that Rose spoils me; that I am spoiled by all the ways she tries to make sure to get word to me, keep in touch with me.  I suppose it's because I wish I could spend every waking and sleeping moment with her sometimes that I don't see it that way.  I am so hungry sometimes for word from her.  And that's miserably unfair; far too much to put on a human being.  So I need to keep working at letting go; letting things and Rose be.  Do you know, I wasn't going to fill up her email inbox but ... I had to send an email last night to let her know I'd gotten home safely (I do that on Tuesday nights as usually I make a Tuesday evening meeting and she has said she needs to know I've made it here safely); then I had to send her an ecard for Bastille Day.  Right?  Of course right!  Liberty, equality, fraternity!  Allons enfants de la Patrie ...  Yeah, well, maybe I didn't actually  need  to send that.  But I did.  I had a chat with Doris's most recent conquest/broken heart.  I found out that she was called even worse names than I already knew she had been called by Doris's daughter.  Besides "bottom of the barrel" she was called ... no.  I won't put those words here.  I had a phone call from Doris herself later.  She cried.  Now, I have some compassion for her; she's in a miserable situation and cannot bring herself to tell her family that she is gay (this is giving her the benefit of the doubt and saying yeah, okay ... you're gay).  But see that's all well and good as the jury's really still out on that topic.  What I don't understand is her inability or unwillingness to say "I love this person.  Don't call her those dreadful names."  Or if those nasty terms have now been applied to me and others they have now figured out are lesbians, to say "Those women are my friends; don't say those things about them."  That is true cowardice to me; that is where her every word to everyone becomes tainted and suspect.  I hardly think it's too much just to defend people who love you, who you love; at least ... you say you do.  But do you, really?  Sorry ... this demon needs exorcising.  It's funny; the first time I read a note from Rose, I regretted that I was involved with Doris.  Now, almost two years after our "affair" ended, I actually regret that my first "relationship" with a woman was with Doris.  Well, in many ways it wasn't; it truly was over before it began, and there was so much artifice and trickery involved that those quotes are necessary.  Still ... all I can do is hope she finds some kind of peace in this life.  And be grateful that Rose stuck it out until I was disentangled enough to turn toward her and give her all I wanted to from the moment I became aware of her, through a song title and three Gaelic words.  I wish Joanie a love like I have been given.  Actually, I wish Joanie a lover who proudly proclaims her love for her.  She lives her life openly and honestly; and she should be loved in just that way.  My Rose is a careful shy woman; matters of the heart and soul and intimacy are private things.  But oh ... when we parted at the airport in January, and she called to me as I was walking up the stairs and stood there within the circle at the foot of them ... waving farewell to me ... and it was hard to stop the tears before they spilled over, but I couldn't let her know how sad her parting made me ... my brave and wonderful little Rose.  She always finds a way to make my soul soar.  Yes, I am spoiled.  And I am blessed.  And just now I am so very, very tired.

      From Doris's strange wrapped-way-too-tight daughter.  On my office voicemail.  From Sunday morning.  What were these people thinking?  This is the daughter who seems to think that some women were put on Earth for her to debase.  She did not leave any insults on my voicemail; big of her, I'm sure.  Extricating myself slowly and in ways Doris can't make out.  Whenever she does get a feeling I might be headed completely out of her life, she reaches out a claw ... well, okay, perhaps I'd be kinder to say a hook ... or ... she cannot stand the thought of truly letting me go.  So.  I merely am less and less available.  I did communicate in a very odd way for a bit with Joanie.  Because I think it disgusting that she was at the receiving end of the daughter's acid tongue when she did nothing wrong in this situation.  But that, as they say, really is that.  I got to talk to Rose today, and that was quite divine.  There was no great import in our conversation.  Just getting to hear her voice is quite wonderful.  Today is a day where there are lots of parades in Northern Ireland; so the weekend and on into today was filled with an exodus of people leaving the north and coming below the border into the Republic of Ireland.  Traffic was crazy around the neck of the teddy bear.  I had wanted to go there sooner this year, but when I told her my optional dates ... well, this weekend would have been involved, and that's not a good time to be there, especially since this trip we expect to be seeing more of Northern Ireland than last time I was there.  I hope she is sleeping well now.  It's just gone 3 in the morning there.  I'm off for a bath and a bed.  I need to write about this sanctuary I've been given by a dear and special woman, a place where I can go that is so beautiful, and unblemished by the mistakes I made when I made a mad rush into making friends all over the world.  For the most part, I have been lucky, and met some absolutely wonderful people.  Really, there was only one huge error; a few mild ones.  Still.  Unblemished is lovely.  This, here, is unblemished.  I'd like it to stay that way.  Isn't it funny; my sanctuary exists in two places, a cottage and a house of belonging.  Just noticed that writing of one, I could be writing of the other as well.  Yes indeed; I am a blessed woman.

      Doris (must be pseudonymous in this online world, of course) ran away from home on Friday.  She ran away to the home of her current lover.  While I was down doing the laundry, my daughter called to tell me that E.L., Doris's husband, had left a message for me to call him.  I waited for a while, and then finally called his number.  Doris answered; apparently she is there, having the face to face talk she promised him she would have with him.  Doris was the first woman with whom I had any sort of intimate relationship.  There was a lot wrong with it; and I knew from the moment I became aware of Rose in this world that she was more of what I wanted, offered the kind of love I truly wanted, and that what I had with Doris was something else, addictive and immature and unhealthy.  However, being rather confused myself at the time, I let things continue with Doris far past the point at which I should have ended our relationship.  Nonetheless, it will have been two years this coming September since anything we had together was officially and completely ended.  We still chat online; she calls me, frequently, on the phone.  All in the name of friendship.  Whatever.  The poor man is devastated.  Their children (the youngest of whom I believe is in her late 30s now) are reeling.  Her oldest daughter flew home from a Florida vacation a day early when told that her mother had run off.  Anyway ...  Doris told me that her family found Joanie's (pseudonym for her current lover; oh it's all such stupidity, all this making up names for people) diary.  Apparently they also "found" my diary.  These are online journaling sorts of things kept through another place and in a different format.  Umm ... okay.  What that would mean, for the most part, is that they now know that I am gay; married, a mother, and gay.  This does not fit the bayou/Roman Catholic/Cajun scheme of things.  "Laissez les bons temps rouler" is all well and good, but married women and mothers are not gay; and among Doris's family, lesbians are "carpet munchers" and other such respectful and tolerant terms.  So this would obviously change how they see me, which is all right, I suppose.  I mean ... it is sad in a way, but then I think, I never did have much in common with them; never told them about that aspect of me because it never came up, and once I had met them I knew that Doris could never give me what I wanted, and certainly for her sake, given what they didn't know about her, far be it from me to be the one to let any cat out of any bag.  I am very grateful that I am not in a situation built on deception and sneakiness such as Doris has lived in, only now to be found out in this glaring way.  I don't really think there will be any major repercussions for me, just ... some sadness, and an inability to call that home even if she winds up living there again.  I have this huge distaste for the kind of drama Doris is living out at this time.  My husband knew the moment I fully admitted to myself who I was.  Oh, he has been hurt; of course he has.  He is getting treatment for the depression and other emotional effects this has had on him.  My children know as well, and they not only have the right and ability to discuss anything about me with me, now ... I won't go running out on them, won't send them reeling off into confusion and hurt and, well,  DRAMA .  I won't be contacting Rose at all until such time as I hear from her.  In a way, this whole thing with Doris ... this is one of the odd ways my emotions work sometimes ... makes me feel tainted.  I wouldn't want Rose involved with someone who was involved, even marginally, in such an ugly situation as the one I find myself dragged into through any sort of friendship that remains between Doris and me.  I feel a bit nauseous about this.  I hope it all washes over and away.  And I hope no wild eyed Cajuns show up at my doorstep or in front of my office building; ack!  Of course, they cannot harm me, due to my blessed ability to live honestly within the very odd circumstances in which I am presently living my life.  But ... oh yuck.  Yuck, yuck, yuck.  The door really needs to close on this chapter of my life.  Enough really is enough.

      As my anticipation about my upcoming time with Rose escalates, other things come in and make things even more high strung than I already feel they are.   Fahrenheit 9/11  ... thought I knew it all, but the impact of the film has me reeling  My strange former lover who seems to still have a bit of a fixation with me leaving her husband and her home to go live with a woman who loves her and with whom she says she's in love even while she calls me from her car to tell me she's done it, she's left home.  And Rose ... dealing with a hundred small annoyances and aggravations, her tummy acting up, but still ... still we talked today and I printed out the reservation confirmation for our hotel stays ... and that was just such a wonderful gorgeous affirmation that yes, we will see each other soon ... in less than a month!  I am tense, I am tired; I am shocked, I am exultant.  I don't know what to do with myself.  Well ... paper and pen, I suppose.

      Those things add up to a sunny day in summer in New York City.  I must type in more of this story that is being told through me.  That's how it feels, somehow.  It's a strange thing.  And it's not easy finding time to do all the things I have to do, and squeezing in typing of my own work can be difficult.  Well ... at least I've got a long weekend, so I am going to grab a tall iced coffee, and get to work typing before I do myself a great kindness and make my way through cleaning and sorting out some more space in this room of my own.  I hope to get enough done on it that I can bring home from the office the three terra cotta tealight candle holders I bought recently for the express purpose of decorating this space.  I won't bring them home until this room is at least halfway ... or three-quarters ... of the way to being what I need it to be.  So far, it's about one-sixth of the way there.  So typing and more progress on this room ought to do a world of good for my hopefulness levels.  Combined with such gorgeous messages as I get from a dear friend ... well, watch out world!  A whole woman is continuing her birth process.  It's not too late; it's only just begun, and I simply need to get from here to there, and I am doing it.  It will happen.  I will be 50 and I will be whole.  I got jewelry today that I ordered on eBay.  Two bracelets and a ring. I gave one of the bracelets to my daughter; the other one and the ring are for me.  They came from Wales; inexpensive.  Bits of stone and glass linked together form the bracelet I am wearing, white quartz and amethyst and tiger eye, chips really.  My ring is blue beads with two clear ones interspersed, and at the ends little silver balls; it wraps around a couple of times and adjusts to fit my finger quite nicely.  Small decorations; important messages to myself.  As is the typing; as is this room.  Messages.  Now if only I heed them!

      One of those times when 3500 miles plus an ocean just add up to too much distance, and a lot of frustration as well.  I spoke to Rose yesterday; her tummy is very, very sick right now.  Which of course means she is sick right now.  It's driving me absolutely nuts.  I am worried, of course, which grows as it will to a certainty that this is appendicitis and unless she gets seen right away by a medical profession this could kill her (she loathes visits to the doctor).  I am also very angry and aware of my utter impotence and futility as I can do nothing to bring her any comfort or relief from where I'm sitting to where she is suffering.  She has a way of assuming I wouldn't want to be there when she is in any state but just fine; but of course I want to be there!  I want to look after her and see that she is as comfortable as can be; and take her to see a doctor, staying by her side so the visit is less scary for her, then bring her home and make sure she follows whatever directions she is given.  Or, God forbid, my crazy worries turn out not to be crazy, to stay with her as she goes to hospital and has whatever is needed done.  Then, of course, I would tend to her during her recuperation.  Yes, I know, I'm a complete idiot.  It can't be helped though, really.  It's the way I love her, and it's so complete it sometimes scares me.  Oh, the children have brought out the nurturing in me; I have found strength in dealing with their illnesses (blessedly few and hardly ever really complicated).  As a matter of fact, they would most likely need to be given the credit for alerting me to the softer, more nurturing side of my nature.  The side that is responding in frustration and a spark of rage at the distance between Rose and me.  Ah well.  She is all right with me not being there with her.  Which is good; the last thing she needs while feeling so ghastly is to experience frustration over distance, me, or anything else.  She told me not to expect to hear anything from her for a few days.  That doesn't make any of this easier, of course; but it does mean I need to leave her alone, because the last thing she needs when she is feeling better is droves of worrywart wordstuffs from me.  It will all go into prayer to a Third Party.  And I'll leave her alone.  And wait and worry and wonder until I hear from her again.  It's the nature of this long distance beast.
