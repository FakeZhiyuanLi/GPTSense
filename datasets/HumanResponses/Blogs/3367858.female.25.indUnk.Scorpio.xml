      So, I think that if we could just go back to being friends who watch horror movies together and allow our relationship to progress naturally and not rush into sex, and sleep overs, and I Love Yous, and whatever nonsense has us all in a tizzy...  Then I think we would be a perfect pair.  I worry now that we have already spoiled what was once fresh and new with too many words and too many feelings.  There is so much time in the world and so many people and the odds that we would find each other this way are so small, and all I ever wanted was for us to be together, but not like this.  Not like a couple of crazed teenagers.  Not like a one-night-stand.  I want You as my best friend.  I want You as my forever.  But I am not ready for the forever.  I never thought I would feel like this again.  I feel like maybe I am destroying what we have because it scares me.  If I allow myself to love You, I would surrender myself to You.  I want You to see to the very bottom of my heart and I want to feel all of You at once.  I want us to look into each others eyes and just know without words, or gestures what the other is thinking.  I want us to be holding hands and growing old together.  I know the love in my heart is too strong for what I am currently ready to handle.  My heart is weak and tired and all I ever wanted was a little rest.  Some R&R.  Writing this has me tearing up and I cannot see the keyboard.  All I need is time.  Why can't You see.  Maybe there will be others in my life.  Maybe even some I "like."  But there is no person on this planet that can replace You in my heart.  You are my perfect match.  I met You at the wrong time for sure, but we can make it the right time if we do this the right way.  Friendship often turns to love, but love to friendship, never.  Understand me.  Maybe letting go just a bit will help us both become better people.  When I sleep alone at night I miss You so much.  I don't want to miss You like this.  I don't think You will read this, but I almost hope You do.  All My Love.

      So here I am at the PC again and I wonder why I let You make me so sad.  I hope that the things You say to me aren't bullshit, because You ask me to not bullshit You.  I try and be frank with You.  I try and tell You that I think we are perfect together.  Destiny?  Soul-Mates?  Fuck You.  I try to say that Fools Rush In.  Do You think that I lie?  Do You think I keep You around for... what?  WHAT?!  Because I don't like You?  Because I have no other people who want to spent time with me?  Why would I make You the biggest factor in my life if I thought we were going to be over soon?  Do You really believe we are short-term.  Maybe You should try to be a little more honest with me.  i can't keep this up i keep crying alone and sad and i feel like i have nobody to talk to and nowhere to go  maybe i need to move away from all my problems like You did  if i was somewhere new and nobody knew me and i could hide from the world instead of spending the time i should be reflecting and soul searching trying to spark a love with a man who thinks i am here for his amusement  do You waste all Your time with me because You dont want to think about the things that really bother You  are You filling the void with me that You really wish You were filling with somebody else  i dont understand anymore i thought i had this under control      shit

      So, here I am drinking with my roommate and I get this bright idea to go online and check my myspace account.  Of course, I was hoping that I had heard from Him.  No such luck.  But I did read his Blog about His "ex" and it really makes me sad.  I am feeling like I got myself involved somewhere that I never belonged.  I can't get upset, I mean it was my idea that we keep it casual and just friends and maybe fuck-buddies or whatever you call it these days...  But that fact is that I am emotionally involved now.  I have felt the first twinge of pain and I know that things won't be the same between us for a while.  I don't want to feel jealousy.  I want it to be perfect and happy and never hurt or be angry.  I wish that love never had to feel like it might never had been worth all this pain.  I almost let Nicholas go today.  I couldn't.  I look at him and although I don't love him I love everything about him.  He never makes me hurt and he will love me with all his heart.  If I could learn to love him the way he loves me I know that life would be good.  But I don't think that I can.  I kiss him and my stomach doesn't make the little flip-flop it does when I kiss Him.  I hate myself for doing this.  I never wanted to be involved.  I just ended my last relationship a few weeks ago (or is it more now I can't recall...)  I am not delivering that letter that I wrote.  I don't know what I was thinking when I wrote it.  I guess that I have this over romantic view of how things are when in reality there isn't nearly the magic I pretend there is... I mean come on...  He live in a garage, with nothing to call his own and nothing to show for himself.  He is the most enigmatic person I think I have ever met and charming and funny and He is manipulating me.  What is it that I do see in you?  Maybe Alex is right?  She may be frumpy but she knows you a hell of a lot better than I do.  You called me and I don't know why I can't resist You.  I feel tired, and my heart is heavy.

      Well, here I am, supposed to be getting ready for work, but instead I'm blogging?  My first one, maybe my last who knows for sure anyways...  I slept too much last night.  It was the first night alone in my bed for several days.  I had a heating pad with me to keep me comfy and to ward off the Cramps.  I am having company again tonight I think.  I am not real sure why...  Because I said if you ever need a place to crash in Olympia you can stay here?  Awkward times.  My roommate wants me dead, we never see each other anymore.  I wrote this letter last night and I am not so sure that I am delivering it to it's intended recipient.  I was tired and maybe I said too much when I really didn't need to say anything at all.  I feel like I need to keep my guard up all the time.  I act like someone I'm not.  I feel like I am a stranger even to myself.  I wanted to take some time to get to know myself better, maybe do some soul-searching...  Maybe I'm just full of shit.  I am unable to tell if I am passing a good thing by or am I afraid because my instincts are telling me something.  I don't know you, you don't know me.  We say I love you and make love to each other almost everyday.  It's nice and peasant and happy but where are we?  We aren't "together."  That would be a mistake, Right?  Ahhh.  Time is running out and I haven't even begun to sort out all the confusion...  I am scared that I am not ready to commit to you.  What if there is someone else out there that fits me better that you?(yeah, right)  What if you are not who you seem to be?  Will I ever really know if I don't give us a chance?

      There are a few things I want to say to You and I will never speak them in person.  I know You claim to no longer be angry with me, but this may re-ignite your anger.  I figured out why I ended it with You.  Not because of the reasons I told You.  All that was bullshit.  I felt like You were "too good to be true."  Everyone puts their best foot forward so to speak.  And I found myself believing that I could really love You.  I am too afraid.  I can't wait to find out what Your bad side is.  I need You to forever be perfect in my memory the way I remember You.  We never fought about money or where to raise the kids or what kind of wedding ceremony we want.  We had this short but beautiful romance and I never want it to change from that in my mind.  I hope that You will someday be the good friend that You seemed to be to me.  But that's all I can offer You.  My true friendship.

      You called me late last night.  Spewing drunken insults and evil words.  I don't know what to say to You.  I can't tell You it's not true.  I can't tell You you are wrong.  I can say the same old bullshit that someone always says.  "I never meant to hurt You.  I never wanted it to be like this.  I am just not ready for this."  It's all true of course.  But you stopped caring.  Maybe it will be easier for me to sink into my personal misery now.  Maybe You can be that hand that pushed me under.  Kelli's home, more later.
