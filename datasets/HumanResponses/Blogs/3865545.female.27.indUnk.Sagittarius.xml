      so im on the greyhound on yet another voyage southward, and im grumpy because the guy next to me is drinking hennessey and smoking trees in the potty, giving everyone a contact high and singing that ooshee wally wally song at the top of his lungs, and i look out the window as a means of escape, and there it is!&nbsp; a billboard that says NoFatChicks.com  now, i was trying to imagine how a fraternity was able to raise funds for I-95 billboards, and i went online at work today to investigate, and it is indeed PETAs masterwork. seriously. so appearently, as i always believed, the masterminds behind cindy crawford et al naked and furless are really just trying to win support from low-selfesteemed teenage boys. now, honestly though, i live in williamsburg, and i see very few of these vegan boys surrounded by unfat, naked models.   so the lesson, as i see it, is:if models aren't going to sleep with you anyway, you might as well have a burger.  at least from my feminist, ex-vegetarian POV (models never slept with me either)

      basically, here it is:  i don't like ANYTHING anyone else likes---  i live in williamsburg (yes, brooklyn), but i don't like fashion, or contemporary indie-pop, or underground hip-hop.  i think it's insulting when upper-middle class northeasterners drink PBR.  basically, i think upper-middle class northeasterners are insulting period, and i try to avoid them at all costs.    i HATE hipsters, and yet i live among them, instead of in Yorkville (but could i really live for $425 a month in Yorkville? maybe).  they creep me out, i find them vacuous and ammoral hyper-consumers of material goods in a poor city (country, world) and underground culture when they either make 60K plus in graphic design OR live off the fam and make post-feminist panties.  however, the hipsters of northeast williamsburg have been very helpful to me during my year-long quest for meaningless sex, and i thank them for it.  even if i didn't always "have one".   i am a hardcore feminist, but i think burlesque is dumb, but i can have vaginal orgasms.  i am a hardcore feminist, anti-racist class-warfare raging sun-ofa-gun, but i only like books by dead white men.  i think southern people are less racist that northerners, except when they're burning crosses (sigh).  i love animals and i love fried chicken.  i find athesists and the religious equally foolish.  i read old riot grrrl writs and i wonder what happened to kathleen hanna's brain.  i wish there was a way to express the essense of being a woman in this world without resorting to cliches or qualifiers.   i don't think ironic 80's graphics and lesbian auxillary members necessarily make something hip or relavent.  i don't think $120 tee-shirts count as a work of art or even personal expression.  i love dolly parton non-ironically.  i drink powdered drink non-ironically.  i think eating disorders are a crisis of capitalism. it took me 27 years to stop caring what the f*#$ my dress size was.    i think polish people are the most wonderful people on earth. it is my deepest wish to become middle class and move to greenpoint.

      I’d rather be somewhere else. . .  If you were to see me now, you’d see potential wasted, a very pretty girl with eyebrows growing in three different directions, hair pulled back with rubber bands and paper clips, no shoes on because her one inch heels are too painful, pants shiny from wear, worn through in the ass with a split seam in the crouch revealing poly/cotton panties bought 3 for 99 cents at a dollar store on Delancy Street more than two years ago.  A streaky mess, papers all over the desk as she struggles to meet the demands of her administrative job, ghost-writing UN policy while answering the phones and manipulating the dulled letter opener because she’s just too mousey scared to say no.  People walk by and laugh to each other, and she sort of smiles at them, but she’s got less then two days to pull this one together, and she knows she’ll need at least 5 to read celebrity gossip websites to get her anywhere away from here.   I’d rather be somewhere else.  Now, let me tell you, when I thought about being 27 (nearly 28, yes I know Mother), I assumed I’d be famous by now, or at least married.  Everyone knew girls like me got somewhere, you just had to A) get that fall-back Bachelor of Arts degree from a top-tier liberal arts college so you could make good conversation (check) and B) move to New York, sit around in Tompkins Square Park wearing an interesting outfit (check).  3 years into New York, one Master’s degree down and one to go, I have no fame, no man, the same now ratty clothes that are no longer so interesting, and of course, no money.  I live in a tiny room in a scary part of the 718s, in walking distance to gentrified shops I can’t afford, I see beautiful men everywhere, but I can’t even bring myself to talk to them.  I feel past my prime, used up and yet never used, I somehow have become drained worn thin (or is it thick) from years of no love and no success.   There’s not enough Haagen Daz in the world to get me somewhere else.  And I’m starting to look older, while I’m still waiting for my life to begin.     I no longer want fame, or any other high level of success or glamour.  If you were to ask me what I wanted, it would be a stable boyfriend, a decent career, a pleasant apartment with matching furniture and a wardrobe of new, well-fitting tailored clothing.  But I’d be lying to you, or at least, part of me would.  Because sure, I want all of those things, but when selling out your dream is this difficult, if it doesn’t come so easily, that’s a sign.  I’m happiest when I’m writing, when I’m cracking people up with my irreverent sense of humor.  If you were to see me yesterday, I’m making even less money at my service industry job, I’m surrounded by people in their twenties with even less hope for their futures then I have, and I’m analyzing all I see, dissecting, twisting, re-shaping the death-like stasis of watching your life go by into a wit that somehow makes us the triumphant ones, over the bourgeois customers that don’t get our jokes and don’t know we’re sneering at them, laughing at them and not with them.  In this setting I’m wearing the same pants and a tight-fitting regulation tee-shirt that displays my ample bosom and I have power, over the boys I sell nachos with, over male customers twice my age and three to four times my income level. I can make girls fall over laughing as we slay and slay.  I am happy, because I am not alone.  Sometimes, when the lines are short and the weather is nice and I do not leave this job covered in butter, I wish I was still back there, instead of with my “real friends” with whom I cannot crack remark after remark about those I see on the street who have more more more.  It would be petty, adolescent, not focusing on the solution and my vision and hope.  Most people I know are too comfortable to be sharp, double-edged razors.  They can’t give as good as they get, so my barbs of insight are wasted upon them.  They are the people we mock the most, the people who come to see a Miramax films to learn something, or because they feel it says something about who they are.  They don’t have the insider knowledge to know that “independent theater” chains are part of mainstream theater chains, with special films marketed not to higher levels of consciousness or even education, but money.  Yes, we know you want to see movies where Chloe gets naked. not because you have more sophistication, but because you have more money; we can tell by your Urban Outfitters clothing.  The Sunshine is the collective of wasted potential, we’re all smart as hell, all creative geniuses as we admire each others drawings and writings in the notebooks we all bring in to pass the long slow hours.  And we’re all nowhere, laughing at the idiocy of somewhere.  But when it gets depressing, it’s depressing.  After I left, the three most special, most smart, most talented boys quit, and people were so sad to see me back, because it reinforced for them that there was no escape.  It’s cold out there, I had to tell them, there’s desk jobs and people who watch “American Idol” non-ironically and your only role models shop at Talbots, and you have no image of yourself reflected in the strip of desks around you.  You’re alone again; you have no one to laugh with and there’s nothing funny about it.  You see two paths, you can stay behind a cubicle desk and collect beanie babies, or you can succeed and become a professional and lose your edge, your sharpness, and become unfunnied.  I used to want to be a stand-up comedian like my idol Margaret Cho, which was a very pleasant fantasy when I was still pre-degree and grown-up life was not something I had to live.  Somehow, when it came to be time, I couldn’t believe that a fat, messy, broke girl could convince the world that pretty and money were funny.  Margaret, at least had had a lot of sex, and people would listen to anything to hear about lots of sex.  I was afraid of sex, and most of my funny stories about boys and nakedness just mad me look more like fat, ugly and wasted potential.  So I laughed to myself, and my secret cadre of special friends who were still nowhere after all these years, but the swallowed humor has to come out, either as slings against girls who wear stiletto heels to the movies or as tears hot and snotty in the restroom after hours and hours and hours behind a desk reading websites about Avril being sick of all the poseur bullshit.   I wanted to be a writer but not the famous kind, the kind where you have to write a certain way to make your words marketable.  Most of my life has been me swallowing my own voice, being quiet and swallowing more and more of everything.  My word on paper, on computer screens one click away from Olsen twin shopping sprees and amazon.com which I can’t afford, have to speak for me, or else I’ll cut myself.

      ok, so i'm waiting for the L train at 1:12AM on Wednesday night, 6th Ave stop.the train hasnt come in forever. im sitting on the benches, next to a busker in his middle fifties with a greying ponytail and a big acoustic guitar, who is trying to get dollar one out of the surly crowd by drawing out "landslide" for twenty minutes (about 15 min of gratutious jams: "wooooo! i said THE SNOW COVeeeered hiiiiilllls! yeah!"). no one will give him any money. we all want to die.  the train to 8th ave comes and screeches to a stop, deafening the group for a solid 2 minutes.as the screechity abates, the busker stops his song, and turns to me, and says: "the only way this could be worse is if you were ugly".  as i had been so bored at work that day that i had given my self a haircut at my desk with no mirror, i was grateful for any non-negative assessment of my charms, so i said: "thanks, i guess"  he stares at me as if i am mentally challenged, and says, at the top of his lungs: "NO, I SAID THE ONLY WAY THIS COULD BE WORSE IS IF YOU WERE UGLY!".  he then began to play steely dan. i don't remember the name of the song.  f*&amp;^ing hippies. . .

      so i'm walking home through my shitty lil neighborhood at about 10:07 PM on a Tuesday, and i see the strangest sight on the corner.  in the few months of the hipster invasion (they must be close to 10% by now) of the M train hewes street lifestyle, i have never, ever seen a whitey communicate with a member of the dominican indigenous population. but now, there was a boy who appeared to be about 12 and was no more than 4 foot 6, chit-chatting with a hipster who appeared to be about 17 but was prolly 29, who was over 6 feet and 125 pounds dripping wet. i figured from the body language, posture and general sassiness of the youth this was a pros/trick-type situation, and i crossed the street to find out and give the young man a stern talking to, but it was only a drug deal.  im so glad my fellow over-educated under-earning crackers are reaching out to appreciate the neighborhoods traditional culture and give back to make our streets safe. i guess we're not getting community park space anytime soon. . .

      ok, so lately i've been noticing more and more the pairing off of nerd men and glamor-industry wimmen. and im not talking guys in aviator sunglasses who work in "design". im talking dorks.  full. on. dorks.  this is not right. i want to see nerd couples prancing arm and arm, giggling and snorting, and staring into each others eyes all lovey. i want to see every pointless blogger guy with a master of library science candidate gal. i want to see every man with his post-post-ironic black glasses held together with safety-pins or scotch tape dating a girl with visible pantylines. i want to see order returned to the universe.  i feel this is all part of the general sense of selfish, arriviste, neo-conservatism thats sweeping society. it should really be about giving back. consider, when the jocks trash-canned you in the jr high cafeteria, who wiped the tater tots off your face with love and adoration? the stilletto-clad female who does PR for stila, or the lonely young lady who sits up nights with her morrissey bootlegs translating medieval french writs for two dollars a word?  i think you know who.  dont let the terrorists win.
