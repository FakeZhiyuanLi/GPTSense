      So I bought this Canon camcorder at the pawn show. 8mm. The stupid thing flickers and the viewfinder is all white and blurry with lines. IT worked fine for the first few times, then decided to go bad on me. It also smells like fish. I have no idea why!  You can't be too careful when purchasing things in a second hand store. Chances are  my receipt is lost, so even if I bring it back, he won't give me what I paid for it.  He remembers selling it to me and also for how much, yet he won't accept it back until I produce a receipt. He didn't even give me one and told me "I'm not a babysitter, guy, you shouldve made sure you had it when you left". This makes my blood boil. Oh well, a lesson learned. Never buy a camcorder made before 1999. You're buying a burned out iris  with a tape recorder attached to it. Basically thats it. I hope the party is fun tonight. I really need a break from things lately. Especially getting ripped off from dishonest crooks running a hock shop.

      Last night was quiet. I sipped my green tea while working on my blog. Anyone who goes through the drive-thru at the Tim Hortons donuts can see clear into my livingroom.  It's bad enough that only 2 windows open in my apartment. I can't imagine summer  without an air conditioner. Work is well. I can't imagine working anywhere else as  far as call centres. Let's move on to other things! I have a writer's block today  so maybe I'll finish this another day. Thank you to everyone who wastes time reading my useless thoughts. Check back soon. I'm due to think of something quirky and entertaining soon enough.

      Have you ever noticed how disconnected the general population is from actual important things that are happening in this world? In these post millenium years, we've all come to take for granted (or most of us) the things that are really of significance in all. Society today tries to glamourize everything, and most of reality for most people is all about money, shopping, sex, partying for no reason (which is ok once in awhile) But seriously. I watched a special last night on CBC tv about this asteroid that's going to hit the earth in the year 2088. Actual NASA employees are now starting the design to off-course the approaching asteroid so it doesn't hit our beloved earth and blow things to smithereens. The interesting thing is, in order to properly push it away from the earth, they have to first discover what the asteroid is made of. The matter of the actual thing! Some are completely carbon, some rock, some are pure metal. And big. Some of these things are as big as an entire U.S. state!  It would be hilarious if the big asteroid DID hit us and it ended up being a state-sized ball of light fluffy black soot. Cause you'd look up, say "Oh my GOD!" and then it would just  "pffouf" land gently all over everyone covering them in soot.   It's the big, steel or rock ones that are of interest. They are trying to construct an instrument to push it away. BUT... they must know the matter before designing an arm to grab it and push it out into the universe. If it was made of carbon, the latch arms would go right through it crushing it into powder form. I just think it would be hilarious to see a big  black weightless black asteroid touching down on top of a building. There wouldn't be any damage. It would just make a big fluffy mess! Hehe.

      It's a beatiful day in the neighborhood, a beatiful day in the neighborwon't you be my  ..my neighbor" Okay that was a mister Rogers quote but damn is it ever nice out  today! I am on the last day at work before my week vacation. I got the keys made earlier today for the new place; Rob and I sat around listening to the jammers in the basement; Drew's really into these new musicians Joe and the other guy, I can't  remember the drummer's name. My toothache has ceased to disable me today, unlike yesterday when the pain was so bad I had to leave work. I bought some OraJel and  codeine to deal with the pain, and keep my job. So anyway this OraJel man does it ever numb your face! It's a little ten dollar tube of novocaine that is great to have  when the dental trouble starts. Other than my painful tooth rotting out of my skull, I am doing fine. Financially everything is in order and other things seem to be  going well as well. Ever notice how when I update things, they only get more specific and not actually saying anything new? I really gotta start working harder on blog material or people are gonna start bashing this page! I can't wait to take calls  on Canada day, oh boy, it's my favorite way to spend it; talking to americans and arguing about rates with every Joe Dick and Martha on the continent. First I'm  trying to get a guy in Manhattan to assist a tow for a breakdown, then I'm on a  tirechange call for Jersey. What fun! Do the americans work on their holiday, yes! BUT...you can bet they aren't talking to Canadians on the 4th of July. That you  can count on. Oh well I suppose I'll be able to see the fireworks if I sit in the  right corner of the building, while all my friends are out with painted faces  and coolers full of beer. Suddenly I am feeling very sick!

      Well, the new place isn't too far away. I am moving in with Drew and Rob, so we can work more closely with music when we're not working. Drew is forming a band, with this wicked bass player named Joe and the drummer I forget his name at the moment. It will be fun,  living there, collaborating with them, taking time off from a band myself, just to spend every living second writing for a new album is something I've already begun, but can't wait for the moment that comes when I polish the cd and toss it in and crank it up. I love listening to the playback of stuff we recorded, it's awesome. Pj gave me news about the band thing, but somehow I feel like either Joe's overbearing sense of rocking out on stage is seeping either a good way or bad way into everyone else playing there. Time will tell. Until then, I am just a "free agent" musician living in a basement room  there for super cheap, while I work on my own stuff. We will jam but I imagine the whole  band thing with Drew and Joe will start to proceed and hopefully it doesn't collide or  damper what I am trying to do. I have nothing against any other musician, just that when some of them take sides, and snub off other musicians (who they either see as a threat because we cramp their style and show them they aren't better, or are just naturally  needing to be center of attention) I am not against anyone or anything with the people I jam with, but why does this thought keep plaguing me? Time will tell, I guess. Vacation is coming up in a few days and you guessed it, I'm moving in the middle of it! Oh joyous day, please, I can't wait to move boxes and heavy furniture; it's my favorite... :0(

      There's a funny thing with my roommate Sarah. She sleeps all the time whenever she's home, she never comes out of her room. I mean she literally hibernates. I would go nuts if I stayed in my room all day for longer than I had to. She has nothing but a bunch of  boxes and burned out candles and sleeps in a mess in the middle of her floor. It's good to have a roommate for this one month left before I move, but heck, you would think the least she would do is clean the pineapple chunks out of the glasses by the sink. Her and her friend get together and drink these great big glasses of some kind of pineapple booze I don't know if it's rum or vodka, but those damn dishes she uses sit there  and pile up. I mean everything is dried on, for weeks. That's not the worst 'cause we all let things go a little once in awhile, right? Yeah. A little. Not this much. There's hair in the drain, all over the sink, she uses all my toilet paper, and has stolen the better cigarette roller I had because hers is identical, except it doesn't work right. Guess who's rolling smokes with the wrong roller? Yup, you guessed it. She switched them and thought I wouldnt notice. Plus I bet I never see that last 10 bucks she owes for rent. This week is going to be the last week there, so I have some packing to do. Boxes of useless papers and junk I never use. I'm even thinking of leaving early so she's there with her dishes to do, and clean up her own mess. I don't care if she has to deal with the landlord. She better have a place to go. I hope for her sake she does, cause when I'm gone and she is still there the rent bill will be a 640.00 if she stays!   Peace out  Matt

      Hi everybody, thanks so much for supporting my blogs! I have read all comments to date and I have to say; this is the place for them. Remember if you're commenting to keep the profanity out, as I often check and work on this site from work in my spare time.  So the new place is just down the street, my rent is 220.00 a month everything included, and best of all, I'm sharing the duplex with my old bandmates and buddies  from years ago. We're all for it, jamming all the time, being able to crank it up late at night 'cause the basement I will live in will be soundproof. I couldn't ask for a better situation. I can't wait to get out of this current apartment! Yeah, the place that's 640.00 a month and is falling apart. There's a stinky stairwell with barking dogS in the apartment next door. Word to the wise for anyone looking for a place in Moncton: DON'T RENT A PLACE ON SAINT GEORGE STREET ACROSS FROM TIM HORTONS. IT IS A TRAP!!! Sabrina is cool, Sarah is AWOL. Anyway, the Monday night jams are going strong  at the Player's Lounge in Moncton! We have a secret "flight recorder" box we plug into the board while performing; it's a VCR recording on 4 to 8hour mode so we catch EVERYTHING (sound only, but at least we get everything without having to put in new tapes) Eventually we will go digital, but the VHS TAPES are doin'  fine for now.   SO....if you're downtown on a Monday night, say around 10:30pm, come on in to the Player's Lounge above Joe Moka coffee on main street. We will be there. Me, PJ HOWE, Andres Arsenault, and various other performers all putting on a rocking good show.  This is all for today, I have to go now. BUT! Keep on reading these blogs, and I will promise to read all comments. Also any comments you may have on comments on the site.  Bye for now! Back to roadside assistance calls...hmfm lol

      Computer please not today. Just let me publish my useless blog!   Well, summer is approaching. I could have spent the extra money on an 8-track digital, but I splurged for an old Sansui sc-2000 and I have two cardiods, Sony type. Works  better than expected because the original tape decks were built stronger, better, and sounded better for recording all together. The way I usually do it is with a small  digital recorder but I run out of time with that thing. The only thing I need now is my mixer back from the dead, and I have exactly what I need (at least for recording  the jams with Jave and friends. The Monday night jams are going really well down at  the Player's Lounge. The other day we had this idea that we could take a VCR, regular VHS and make an 8-hour taping of the whole shows. We'll start a library. I can't wait  to get the thing hooked up. It'll be an 8 hour thing where it sits in the corner in a bag and nobody knows abnout it. This is truly what we should do to keep track of  the sessions. Well work is having a jam night tonight. I just can't go because I wasn't scheduled ahead of time. That blows because I could really entertain people too. This day is not the worst, it's just a little less than the way I imagined it. Well then again what isn't. So I have to start looking for a new place soon and the landlords  are complaining about everything. I wish they'd just shove it, 'cause the rent is  always paid. They're crying because I told them the rent is high and I'm moving out.  One of them told me to 'make it look spotless' I was like are you kidding you're  an idiot, this place was dirtier when I moved in. You guys don't care, come on, don't b.s. me with that' They didn't seem to like that but like I said if the rent's paid  they take all kinds of guff from me, I mean honestly, wouldn't you, if your bedroom  was next to a bathroom with no insulation between the walls? You can hear everything  from someone sitting on the toilet to blowing their nose. They might as well be in bed with you while you're sleeping on the other side of the paperthin wall. Seriously though, it's that bad. Oh yes and the dogs. There are two of them and they like running up and down the stairs, beating their tails and chops against my back door, which also is paperthin, so you can imagine. It's like living in a kennel actually. Lately it hasn't been so bad. Well time to say goodbye for today. Keep reading the posts, keep  commenting. Tanya you need to comment!!!   - until soon again -Matt

      original blog sunday june 6 - this one underneath is TODAY'S (Thursday June 10, 2004)  So I wake up today and there's no hot water. Landlords' like "yeah, try it when you get home from work then call me in the morning." I'm like "yeah..." thinkin' 'yeah you stupid idiot' They really don't care about our building or anything just as long as they get their rent money. It's rediculous. Anyways, so my roomate has moved in and I got a first time to see her drunk. Her friend Sabrina came over and we all sat on the back porch playing "guns" with the little kid downstairs. It was all fun until the kid started to throw sharp knives at us. I went in, turned on the stereo and I think I passed out shortly after. Pretty useless night last night. At least I wasn't alone though. Working this new shift has taken it's toll on my brains and I feel it's getting better, but there's still some adjusting to do. Tomorrow's payday, and I can go get my bass guitar back from the pawn shop. Went to the store today to return some overdue VHS movies. Me, myself and Irene and another one I forget. I think it was The Skulls. The dude looks up at me and smiles; "Fifty two sixty three" and as he waited I just looked at him, speechless, motionless. I spoke up; "What, are you sure, that's a rediculous fine...sure there's no mistake?" "Nope. But I'll make you a deal. I'll clear it off for ten bucks." I was lucky! He said I was lucky to catch him in a good mood. It wasn't like I was going to pay the fifty whatever bucks anyway. Who would?  For vhs video tapes one week late? Give me a break. DVD I can understand. VHS TAPES??! And they weren't even new releases! It's 7:42pm in the middle of my shift and I'll probably get a call soon. So, I have to cut this short. Hope you enjoyed today's blog update. Stay tuned kids. More to come.

      "they don't have a clue... they're regarded as flakes"   When you work in a place where there's so many people, you have to expect gossip.  Generally there are the passives, which are the people that stay out of it, and then  there's the aggressive gossiper who tries to create problems for coworkers. My personal choice is to ignore these types of people. Some people try to act like they can read your mind or, something along the lines of thinking ' I know he likes me so I'm going to start telling people about this incident that happened..' Then they proceed to start gossiping like little children about what their perception is on person(s) and it spreads so after awhile the whole workplace had heard something about it. On the other hand, it's not hard to ignore this whole ordeal. Whenever that girl walks by that you know from your training class (who thinks you like her because you called her extension by mistake in training back when you started working there) is obviously not a stable person.   That,  or, she has to bring attention to herself so not to feel left out or unpopular. People  misinterpret me, for instance, almost every day in some way or another. I keep to myself and I don't talk about other people behind their backs. Especially when I don't even know them. A lesson can be learned by all of this. Don't give those people the satisfaction.   Make it obvious by ignoring them, avoiding eye contact too. One little hint of your  attention makes it that much easier for them to create something new. The sad part is, these people usually have more problems with themselves than anyone else.  It's quite the opposite of what they think is going on. That's the hilarious part.  So next time someone starts something about you, if at all, don't fuel the fire.  Ignore it and laugh, because you know you're the better person!

      Why is it that when you walk down the street and you live in a small city, everyone else on the sidewalk seems to think they own it. And you pass people to the left, not the right. When will people learn? Okay so I heard a Len song; "when you pass people on the sidewalk you pass 'em to the left, not the right" and that lyric stuck with me every day after hearing it whenever I'm walking on the sidewalk. I can't stand people who walk slowly and then when you go to pas them they look over their shoulder in a way that says 'hey watch it' when all you want to do is get to work faster so you won't be late, everyone else is walking like old ladies and drinking slurpees in the sun. Working nights pretty soon so I'll be able to enjoy the sun a little more. Or when you stand in line ups at the bank, or the coffee shop, or wherever, and that big dude butts in front of you, knowingly, without remorse. I often imagine myself in that moment speaking up and saying "excuse me, but you know you're not next; do you mind?!" Lately this mild rage thingy overcomes me but only outside of work. I can't stand the way people are in this city and I often think of moving. Sure we all have our good friends, some better than others, but let's face it. If you're as human as I am, it's the subtle things that get to us. And what's with those people that read comics while on the toilet? What the heck is that all about? Sure, okay, poop, but do it an' get outta there already!

      The evening was painted party grey with drinks and smoke, the room dim and the guitars rocking gently to the sound of Alice in Chains. The people on Main street sometimes throw rocks or beer bottles (the people the cops didn't catch and put in  the drunk tank overnight)at the window in the room we rehearse in. Last night was more of a jam than a rehearsal. We are getting things underway more now; Drew is going to speak to a certain someone and fair things up a little more, because we're  always finding things to replace that comes out of our pockets like guitar strings,  drum skins, the odd stolen or lost lead cord... etcetera etcetera. So the bottom  line is, the Monday night jams are getting bigger and better, but we haven't seen the result yet. We also pay our own cab and equipment costs.      So, if you're down at the jam, please don't ask to be paid to play unless you're  the feature jammer/band. We really have a lot of working things out to do before we can offer anyone, even ourselves, any form of pocket payment. Until further  notice, anyone can come up to the stage and play for free. There will also be no  cover charge until further notice. This is essential to keep people coming in, and  keep the bar sales going. Ya might think arranging a jamnight is easy and fun, and yes it is fun, but a lot of work goes into it. Set up, sound level check, final sound check, then collaborating so everyone gets a chance to get up and play/sing.  We are trying to stay away from cover songs so the evening is special with better than the usual cover tune scene. We have Nettwerk lurking in the crowd, yes, in little old Moncton, believe it or not! They drop in every other week (when she can) or when he can, as to make sure we're on the right track.  It's part of an artist development program in conjunction with the label. That doesn't mean getting famous or anything. It has to do with a bigger picture  but I don't have time to explain it now, as I'm at work and I need to start my  day pretty soon. So keep reading because I am constantly making new blogs for  everyone to enjoy. And if you're a musician, get your *ss down to Player's Lounge on Main Street in Moncton every Monday night. 10pm-2am; so be there or be square!

      Not unlike any other day, today I crawled out of bed around 1pm. I woke to the usual pitched black, windowless, humid room in the basement of our duplex where I live, but I felt strange, as if this waking up was from a dream where things happened that were significant, but I don't know what. It's like having a déja-vu moment, but it's more of a sentimental feeling rather than remembering images or surroundings from the dream(s) that I had last night. I feel like my own personality has shifted, for the better, as if something changed in me overnight. I guess that's good if it's a positive feeling, 'cause lately that's what I need to focus more on, being positive  in the little things that usually hound my brain. Friends are stopping the bad drugs, my roommate is one, I am proud of the dude, he stopped doing hard drugs and I keep telling him he should stay off any chance he has do do any, because his choice  is MDMA (or better known as ecstasy) which is the most horrible for the body, especially the amount of times he has done it.  Anyway, the day is cool, a bit cloudy, but the sun peeks through at times. It's about 5:00pm and I'm at work. I feel relaxed at work more than usual lately after having a bout of some absences/feeling like crud. I'm on an up kind of mood and I don't know why, but I like it. I guess it's cause I got my stuff "in check" as far as balancing life with work life. I hope the feeling lasts! Have you tried those  friggin Tim's iced cappucino? It's pretty Mackin'! Anyway, gotta go, keep reading everyone. It won't be long before something new and exciting happens I'm sure.

      Hey, and thank you for checking this update. I have been rather busy lately with work, being sick, and playing music. The sick part really knocked me off my feet for a few days and I'm still getting my strength back. I ended up eating something that gave me wicked horrible I won't mention what. Anywho, right now it is 15 minutes into my shift, and I haven't taken my first call yet. So I figured I'd load the blogger up and finish something here, since it's been almost a whole week. I'm only updating weekly now. That way is better since it gives a chance for things to happen and things to blog about! A complete new direction is happening with Monday nights, the house band (us) is starting to make big crowds come inside and every week gets  more and more. The back yard looks like another site for the Westmoreland county sanitary landfill, or DUMP if you will, because the crazy loud hateful people that live upstairs started biffing things they own down in the parking area in back where we sit by our patio. I ALMOST got an old broken stereo in the head in a box full og rags, and then an old rusted ironing board with cheese on it comes flying down and misses my shoulderand head. All the while these objects were flying off from the top, some lady is cursing and swearing under her breath like 'oooh you f***, oooh!" And I felt like screaming up to her; "Hey be careful you freak, you aren't even looking before you chuck that crap down here, you're messed up lady!" But, that would create a bad neighbor relations kind of thing which I want to avoid at all cost. I did manage to say "Hey what the hell, are you crazy?!" loud ebough and then the throwing of household items stopped. But the cursing didn't!

      If you had a dog, would you leave the little buddy outside all night? I wouldn't!  The people upstairs have a baby pitbull, cuter than pie, and the poor little  fellow has to sit outside all night. I think calling the SPCA might be a little much, but for god sakes, if you have a dog I hope you take care of him/her.  Anywho, so the people upstairs, that crazy family, obviously don't take care  of the poor thing.&nbsp;I was outside enjoying a beer on the underneath balcony where we always sit and play guitars outside; all of a sudden it starts to rain!  Does it though? It's the dog peeing through the cracks of the upper balcony.  So it goes in my beer, and I have to pour it out. Getting mad doesn't do any good because I swear half the people that live in and around our building carry guns and get in late night brawls all the time. Other than living around these  kinds of people, things are still going fairly well with the jamming. Monday  nights are starting to really 'take off!' I actually got approved when I asked  for switching from tues/wed off to sun/mon off. Now I won't miss any more Monday night jams! Aren't you just ecstatic for me??? Hehehe..

      Well it's halfway through summer and I haven't noticed my room getting to hot at night, pretty decent. The best thing about living in a basement apartment is that it's nice  in summer, and the worst is, in summer, floods can happen. None yet but a potential  hazard. Seen it before. Anyway, we really need a de-humidifier because there's sweat dripping off the cold water pipes. Which, in turn will eventually cause mold problems  down there. Our neighbors are crazy. At 11am when I'm not up yet still in bed, you can hear EVERYTHING through the walls. "Alright everyone dirty laundry up the stairs NOW!" A lady screaming at her kids or something, then she bangs on the wall. It's like, right on the other side of my wall and it happens every tuesday morning around 11am.  Arguing breaks out on occasion and even though they live in the duplex beside us,  we all get front row seats. So to speak. Yeah so anyway they're nuts. The father is always on something or drunk, the son comes home and his mother forces him to pay her his whole week's paycheque. This was funny, because we were standing on the deck and  enjoying the breeze when we heard foot stomps coming down the steps from their balcony above, it was the kid who's mom just told him he needed to pay her for bills, the whole cheque or something. He was cursing and beating and walking in circles scratching his head. There's a pitbull, a baby one, they treat it like crap. We're talking REAL east end city white trash; with the exception of one person in the other apartment which is  the sister of one of my roommates. Oh well, I guess you can't get away from that stuff if you keep living in the east end, at least, I can't seem to. We don't mind it so much because they never complain when we're having loud studio sessions in the basement jamroom at 4am. I often wonder if they can hear it much because we've never had any complaints yet. If you come to the jams, you might come with us after but that depends on if you're invited. If you play guitar you probably are. Until next time, thanks again for reading my useless blog update. Peace out!

      Mondays are becoming more significant; we finally broke the funk barrier and now we're into jazz and fusion jams. Other than that, we're playing our own songs  we've written or are working on. We're bringing in a helluvalotta people for  this bar, so we better get us what due us. So to speak. Anywho, Andres decided  to use his effects this coming monday, and focus more on classical and jazz.  We've played so much funk lately that it's starting to smell. Funky. So Grant's  band is starting to do well now and they are playing more than a few songs in  the upcoming monday. We don't know their name yet, but we'll keep you posted on that. Since I have to start my shift at work now, I'll finish this later. Keep visiting. You are free to comment or ask questions as you wish...bye for now!   -Matt
