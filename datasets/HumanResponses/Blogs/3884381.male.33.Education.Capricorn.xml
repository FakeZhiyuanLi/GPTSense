      In the wake of Joel Quile's  urlLink Post  on music, I began to think about the kind of&nbsp;music I like in general.&nbsp; There are a lot of bands that I am proud that I like.&nbsp; I am proud&nbsp;that I&nbsp;listen to Pillar, Sonicflood (the old lineup), Jennifer Knapp, Audio Adrenaline, and the Supertones (I actually am beginning to&nbsp; love  SKA Punk).&nbsp; I am even proud to listen to the Grateful Dead (I'll share my views on my first Dead show soon), Jimmy Buffett, and the Black Crowes.&nbsp;   I find that when you ask people what they listen to, the most common response is "everything".&nbsp; So I ask you, Mr. Everything Listener, is that really true?&nbsp; Do you listen to  everything ?&nbsp; You do?&nbsp; You routinely listen to classical?&nbsp; Gregorian Chants?&nbsp; Tejano?&nbsp; Carl Lewis singing the National Anthem?&nbsp;  Everything ?&nbsp; I don't think so.&nbsp; I know you have your favorites and that is fine.&nbsp; But you don't listen to everything.&nbsp; Show me your John Tesh CD and I might start believing you...   But, what do you listen to that you are not so proud of?&nbsp; What is the one band that you listen to that (if people knew) would be a source of ridicule?&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it Eminem or&nbsp;the Dixie Chicks?&nbsp; Is it Outkast or John Denver?&nbsp; Do you like Megadeth or Yanni?&nbsp; Who is it?&nbsp; Enquiring minds want to know.&nbsp; What gets your foot tapping that shouldn't?&nbsp; Are you man (or woman) enough to say it here?   I bet you are.   Just for clarification, I have a lot of them.&nbsp; Billy Idol.&nbsp; Prince.&nbsp; Will Smith's "Getting Jiggy Wit It".&nbsp; Every 80's Hair Metal Band out there.&nbsp; I love 'em all.&nbsp;   There you go.&nbsp; My heart on my sleeve.&nbsp;   And now that I think about it, maybe I secretly do like John Tesh...&nbsp;

      At our small group this past Sunday night, a story was told on one family's youngest child.&nbsp; It seems she had been praying, thanking God as kids do for each and every member of her family.&nbsp; As she wrapped up, her Mother wanted to encourage her to "thank God most of all for..."  "ME!", she exclaimed innocently.&nbsp;   So that got me thinking, which is always a dangerous proposition.&nbsp; Do I thank God for me?&nbsp; I know the purpose of the Mom's prodding was to have her daughter become more and more thankful for Jesus.&nbsp; I understand that.&nbsp; But that sent me down another path of thinking.&nbsp; Am I thankful that God made me who I am?  So many times I find myself trying to be someone I'm not.&nbsp; God made me who I am and I should fall on my knees and thank him for that.&nbsp; Plus, I realize that the one person that I need to imitate more is Jesus.&nbsp; That is who God made me to be like.&nbsp; The more I try to be someone else, the less I am who God made me and the less Jesus' qualities I have.&nbsp; Praise God for who I am.  Lord, you are my creator and refiner.&nbsp; Mold me and shape me into what you want me to be.&nbsp; Take my heart and make it yours.&nbsp; Send your spirit to fill me up.   Psalm 139    O Lord, you have searched me and you know me   You know when I sit and when I rise   you perceive my thoughts from afar   You discern my going out and my lying down   you are familiar with all my ways   Before a word is on my tongue   you know it completely, O Lord.    &nbsp;  You hem me in - behind and before   you have laid your hand upon me.   Such knowledge is too wonderful for me,   too lofty for me to attain.    &nbsp;  Where can I go from your spirit?   Where can I flee from your presence?   If I go up to the heavens, you are there   if I make my bed in the depths, you are there   If I rise on the wings of the dawn,   if I settle on the far side of the sea,   even there your hand will guide me,   your right hand will hold me fast.    &nbsp;  If I say, "Surely the darkness will hide me   and the light become night around me,"   even the darkness will not be dark to you   the night will shine like the day,   for darkness is as light to you.    &nbsp;  For you created my inmost being   you knit me together in my mother's womb.   I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made   your works are wonderful   I know that full well.   My frame was not hidden from you    when I was made in the secret place.   When I was woven together in the depths of the earth,   your eyes saw my unformed body.   All the days ordained for me were written in your book   before one of them came to be.    &nbsp;  How precious to me are your thoughts, O God!   How vast is the sum of them!   Were I to count them, they would outnumber the grains of sand.   When I am awake, I am still with you.    &nbsp;  If only you would slay the wicked, O God!   Away from me, you bloodthirsty men!   They speak of you with evil intent   your adversaries misuse your name.   Do I not hate those who hate you, O Lord,   and abhor those who rise up against you?   I have nothing but hatred for them   I count them my enemies.    &nbsp;  Search me, O God, and know my heart   test me and know my anxious thoughts.   See if there is any offensive way in me,   and lead me in the way everlasting.   Take a moment today to thank God for "you"...

      Well, Fox Sports Net is debuting a new show this week entitled "The Sports List".&nbsp; It will most likely be mildly entertaining.&nbsp; It&nbsp;will definitely be off the air within 3 months.&nbsp; We all know the current trend (besides thrilling "reality" T.V.) is lists.&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, if I am not mistaken, &nbsp;VH1 and ESPN Page 2 has given us every list already.&nbsp; Why do we need more?&nbsp;  &nbsp;  But, having said that, I am not one to buck a trend.&nbsp; And, since I am not going to have my own reality show soon (unless Fox picks up the hit series "I'm married and faithful to my wife and have no interest in testing that" for a second season), I will give in to the list craze.&nbsp; Therefore, I declare this the "Week of Lists" on my Blog.&nbsp; I am sure these lists&nbsp;will spark&nbsp;heated debate among, well, me, myself and I.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  So, without further delay...  &nbsp;  My Top Ten Favorite Texas Rangers of All Time  &nbsp;  1.&nbsp; Nolan Ryan  2.&nbsp; Pudge Rodriguez  3.&nbsp; Pete Incaviglia  4.&nbsp; Steve Buechele  5.&nbsp; Buddy Bell  6.&nbsp; Rafael Palmeiro  7.&nbsp; Rusty Greer  8.&nbsp; Richie Zisk  9.&nbsp; Fergie Jenkins  10.&nbsp; Frank Tanana  &nbsp;  So there you have it.&nbsp; A list that truly makes no difference in the world.&nbsp; I have accomplished all that I could have hoped for with it.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Go Strangers.&nbsp;

      I could not be more disgusted.  It's obscene.  There should be laws against it.  It's ghastly.  And I couldn't be more amazed by it.  In watching the British Open on TNT this morning, I heard the news.  Tiger's using a new driver.  How I missed this story, I'll never know.  But I learned he is using a blue graphite shafted, Nike Ignite Driver.  And, with that driver, he hit a golf ball 410 yards in a practice round.    410 Yards.    Are you kidding me?  I can't do that on concrete.  I can't do that on XBox.  I can't hit driver/5 iron 410 yards.  It is a ridiculous stat.  And, I may be the only Tiger fan left on the planet (People seem to root against him more than for him), but in my mind it only adds to his lore.  Like I said, it's obscene.  Nobody can do that.  Not even a sober John Daly.    Sure I believe the greatest golfer of our era (besides Rocco Mediate) needs to start hitting it straight or it won't matter.  But I still love to watch Tiger play.  I love the intensity.  I love the swing.  I love the emotion.  Maybe the driver can help him get on track and reclaim the golf world's love too.

      Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge recently warned our country about possible large scale terror attacks on or before the November election date.  There is much speculation that al Qaeda and other terror groups would like to impact the election. Many believe that the attacks in Spain did just that.   So I ask, in the wake of all of the discussions and announcements following that warning, has anyone thought that al Qaeda just may want Bush in power?  Could it be that these attacks are planned to unify the voters to re-elect W.?  Isn't he is the "figure head of evil" in Jihad?  Sure Bush would continue the fight, and Kerry might as well, but Islamic Militants all over the world have (in different words of course) called Bush their anti-Christ.  Doesn't that weaken their jihad stance to have him out of power?  Just a little light-hearted food for thought on a Tuesday.

      Last night was my initial viewing (and most likely not my last) of the new extremely intelligent comedy, "Anchorman".  When I say intelligent, what I really mean is completely mindless.  Rarely do I see comedies in the theatre. If I am going to part with seven to ten dollars of my hard earned money to see a movie...I want to make it count.  I want epic.  I want huge stars.  I want thought provoking.  I want a running time of over 89 minutes.  "Anchorman" was none of these.  But, oh, was it worth it.  I have never seen a comedy in the theatre where I left in pain.  "Anchorman" almost killed me.  It was an hour and change full of chuckling, tears and knee slapping.  Hysterical is an understatement.  I feel like I should recommend it.  Or should I?  They nearly pulled off this riot without the use of bad language, but alas, they gave in.  So as I comforted Kyle at 3:00 in the morning (swimming - water in his ears), I started wondering...how do I react?  I want to tell everyone how hilarious this was.  But as a Christian, can I do that?  I mean, it wasn't excessive violence, nudity or any "evil" themes.  It was just a little bad language.  And, I actually already have recommended it...I told one of good friends to go see it while in California.  Was that wrong?  Did I make a mistake?  I saw this flick with some of the people who I see as great Christian mentors in my life.  How do they react to the language?  Are we supposed to just "overlook" it?  Much prayer will follow.  So...should I "drop" the anchor?

      Well, I'm taking the plunge.  I am doing something I swore I would (or could) never do.  I started a blog. So...  Welcome to the wonderful world of my mind.  I'll give the obligatory "no one is ever going to read this but me...so why write it?  Why does it matter?"  And that could be true.  I may be typing in a vacuum only to be lost forever on the internet.  But I doubt it.    Some brave soul (like yourself) will venture into the far corners of my thoughts.  Trust me...it is a short journey.  I told one of my good friends that I was starting a blog and he couldn't have been less thrilled.  Well THAT motivated me.  But I am here anyway.   I want to thank my good friends Quile and Boone for inspiring me to do this.  You guys may never read it...but you inspire me anyway.    So until the next random thought...I bid you good weekend.

      Well, my son, Kyle turned 6 on Friday.  Someday I will post on just how old that makes me feel.  In fact, I can feel the liver spots exploding on my hands as I type.  Anyway, leave it to some of the grandparents to overwhelm him with ways to celebrate his birthday.  My son, who again is now   6,   was give $85 to spend at Geoffrey's (The Toys R' Us Superstore).  What are these people trying to do to my son?  Fry his brain?  Give him an early heart attack?  How is a 6-year-old going to decide how to spend $85 in a large retail toy outlet?  I'll tell you how.  He'll do it painfully.  It will be agonizing.  I will carry stuff all over that store, put it back, and start all over again.  Did he want Power Ranger stuff or Ninja Turtles?  Oh wait...there's a guitar!  No, wait...I want an Xbox game.   We had been there an hour and a half when I called my wife and said "We're back at Square One!".  That's right.  Ninety minutes and he had selected... nothing .  Unbelievable.  Can you imagine him trying to select colleges?  How about what tie to wear with that suit?  Which wine do I serve with fish?  I say all this to say.  I love my son very much.  And he is exactly like me.  I have learned how hard it is to actually spend money.  I got $50 from my Mom for no reason last year.  I couldn't buy anything.  I'm ridiculous.  When I was in college, I spent money like it grew on trees.  Now, I'm frugal.  I can't believe it.  I now realize I passed a learned gene to my son.  Poor kid.  When we finaly selected his items (He meticulously spent $90.84), he was ecstatic, exhausted and brain dead.  But, Kyle looked at me and said, "I don't like spending money...it's too hard."  I just hope he remembers that.   Especially when I give his son an $185 gift card to Geoffreys in 2032.
