      Kitten little is running around the computer room meowing piteously. Poor thing. Her mama is outside having some alone time without her sole offspring. I wonder as I watch this little scrap of mischief creep around the room exactly what does this all look like to her? How do our animal companions perceive us? Are we just big clumsy clomping noisy creatures to them? Or am I a mobile can opener and resident ear scratcher? I love how when I get home they all rush to the door, calling out in their very distinctive ways. It's like a class of grade school children rushing to be the first to tattle on the other. I can imagine what lies they have come to tell me.... " Mom! Wednesday knocked over an incense burner! Sam pulled my tail! Katie peed in the laundry! Yeah so! Well Fat boy scratched up the sofa you told us not to get on and Brat knocked over a whole can of paint and painted the bathroom blue.." And so on. when Chiquita was alive, she was always my first greeter. I would pick her up, rub her fuzzy grey belly and ask her how her day was and if she had been a good kitty. Then an ear scratch for my Maine Coon who does not like to be picked up. A back scratch for Katie the pissy kitty. A cuddly hug for my Wednesday. Fat boy would jump into my arms while his sister Brat would climb on my shoulders, then wrap her paws around my head and ride around the house grooming my hair. It looked like some weird old ladies be-dillied hat come to life on my head. Then we would fill the dinner dishes and I would have to stand guard over Sam's bowl. Sam, for as big as she is, is a real pussy. She has no teeth and has to eat wet food, so the other cats try to sneak into her dish. I have tried to feed her in a separate room, but that just led to Wednesday learning how to open doors by jumping onto the doorknobs and hanging on until they turned. Now there is not a room in the house with a door that opens inward which is safe from her. I am waiting for her to figure out how to operate the refrigerator door next. I dreamed about Chiquita last night. How can it be that one cat can mean so much that even 4 years after her death I still mourn her loss. I have seen small kittens which look like her at the adoption sites, but when I pick them up, there is something missing. She had a wisdom about her. She was the sort of cat the ancients would have dressed in jewels and worshiped. She was a grey and black longhaired tabby with large almond shaped sea green eyes. She maybe weighed eight pounds at her heaviest. Never having had a litter of her own, she still tried to nurse the stray kittens I brought home frequently. She ruled the roost, often putting my 70 and 90 pound dogs in their place. She was a terror on four legs. A mighty huntress of catnip mice and milk bottle tabs. The year she suffered with cancer was horrible for both of us. I knew something was wrong when she stopped greeting me at the door with such enthusiasm, but I put it down to her advanced age. After all, as I get older, I get less social too. One day, she jumped on the table in front of me, lay on her back and showed me the lump where her nipple used to be. She must have known she was dying. I took her to the vet, and I asked them to put her to sleep. The doctor on duty tried to talk me out of it, wanting to do tests, surgery, radiation treatments and other heroic efforts. I took the antibiotics he gave me and went home with her. Chiquita and I fought nightly for a week about putting the medicine on, taking the pills and not biting at the growing mass. Finally, I sat with her in the kitchen and explained to her about the vet's suggestions. I would do all those things if it would help her, but when I asked the vet if the cancer would come back, he had looked away before he said maybe. How could I torture this precious life in front of me for months just to have a maybe chance of survival? Then she put her paw on my arm and head butted me and I knew I could not do that to her. I brought out her carry case and told her it was time. She got in slowly and we went back to the vet. This time a different vet was on duty. He looked at the chart, looked at my angel and told me I had made the right choice. The cancer was too far gone for anything to fix it, and she was in a great deal of pain. I held her while he prepared the needle and when the first injection of pain medicine entered her body, I knew how much pain she was in as she relaxed for the first time in at least a month. When the euthanasia finally kicked in and her spirit let go of her body I knew it. I cried for what seemed like hours, but I knew I had done the right thing for her. It made me think about euthanasia for people. I loved my cat enough to stop her pain. Do I love my mother enough to do the same for her if the need arises? How about my partner? Could I stop being selfish long enough to ease their pain, even if it meant that I would be alone? Goddess I hope so.

      I was in the garden tonight . The Moon is full and makes the gladiolus seem to glow in the dark. I sat on the grass which was still wet with the days rain and I watched the moths and fireflies circle my yard. The sounds of the insects going full tilt formed a sort of white noise in the background and as I listened I realized that it pulsated in time with my heartbeat. At that exact moment I felt an overwhelming sense of connectedness with nature. The smell of the mint and rosemary was like exotic perfumes around me. Even the grass felt electric. everything I sit in my garden I feel peaceful and welcomed as if the plants have just wrapped hundreds of small green arms around me. I feel their feathery touches and can almost hear the green tinkle laughter of the flowers who are so glad to see me. Each plant stretches itself up , begging for my attention. " Here! Prune me! Get these weeds away from my feet! ... Yo! Woman! I need some more water! Smell me! Smell Me!!!!" I find myself talking to them, my small earthbound children, telling them each to wait their turn, I promise I will get to you next. And then I come back into the house and the reality of my household settles on me. My Son, who is old enough to take care of feeding himself has waited around all day, beak open, waiting for me to drop food down his gullet. The house is a mess and no matter how much I clean it, the gremlins bring more clutter everyday while I am at work. I wish I could live in my garden.
