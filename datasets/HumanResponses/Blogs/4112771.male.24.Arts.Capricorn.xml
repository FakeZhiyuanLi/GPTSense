       urlLink    A picture of me taking a picture of me taking a picture of myself on television. The only light falling on my hands and face is coming from the light my portrait is transmitting from the screen. This might sound complex but it is after all a self-portrait of Crisscrass.  copyright perineum productions

       urlLink    Wednesday, late evening. The Ring of Brussels. Somewhere in between. I can feel the emptiness here. The blankness between two dots. We need this empty space. So that we can find the space to fill. The one that is used. Like the small dots that will be surrounded by white, but if you look a little less closer, you will see the picture coming out of all the dots and the blankness won't be there for you to see. But it's there. And we know it. Try to forget it. But we need it. There can be no meaning without the acknowledgement that there is so much meaningless matter. We can only be because we are aware that we weren't there. Won't be there. One day. We can lose our senses trying to make sense of it all. I could do that. Not now. Not knowing what I don't know.  Today I just lean back as the guy next to is driving the car from one dot to the other. I'm sitting back and enjoy the space in between...  copyright perineum productions

       urlLink    So my little friend here was about to tell me why the famous Amanita Muscaria wasn't exactly his idea of a cosy house when all of a sudden I felt the overwhelming urge to go and do something else...  copyright perineum productions

       urlLink    I remember growing up in this city and not knowing it was an international port. I did know there was a river of course, but I guessed ports had to be at the seashore. So I always felt kind of funny waking up with the distant shriek of a lone gull circling above this vast landscape of bricks and concrete. I felt somehow as if the sea couldn't be far away. Hidden maybe, behind the shadow of a towering skyscraper. (Only later I would find out what real skysrapers look like, but back then I was just a six year old kid living a kid's life in the big city) And for a brief moment there I would taste the sharp smell of salt in the morning air...  copyright perineum productions
