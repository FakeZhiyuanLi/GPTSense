      I am seriously getting way to into art.  For the first time in ages, I started drawing again, my skills aren't that good, but the fact that I do it says something.  I've also started to randomly write down poems, and song lyrics for no apparent reason.  I guess it's good to have my slightly artistic side back, but I wonder why?  I'm not particuarly sad or happy.  I have moments of either emotion randomly but that's about it.  Speaking of which, I'm thinking if I become a  Quaker, that I'll also be Baha'i.  That seems like a very promising religion, but I can't get over the fact that the think Baha'u'llah as divine.  Oh well.... I need to read more about it anyway.  The most interesting thing I found was probubly this:  "The Bahá'í belief in one God means that the universe and all creatures and forces within it have been created by a single supernatural Being. This Being, Whom we call God, has absolute control over His creation (omnipotence) as well as perfect and complete knowledge of it (omniscience). Although we may have different concepts of God's nature, although we may pray to Him in different languages and call Him by different names--Allah or Yahweh, God or Brahma--nevertheless, we are speaking about the same unique Being. The Bahá'í belief in one God means that the universe and all creatures and forces within it have been created by a single supernatural Being. This Being, Whom we call God, has absolute control over His creation (omnipotence) as well as perfect and complete knowledge of it (omniscience). Although we may have different concepts of God's nature, although we may pray to Him in different languages and call Him by different names--Allah or Yahweh, God or Brahma--nevertheless, we are speaking about the same unique Being."   Isn't that just wonderful?  All of us over the world, praying, and worshipping the same infinitely giant God?  Doesn't it just re-usure people to know, that God is all and that only in our ignorance we'd try to make him into many, even though He is all things?  Wow, I really just felt a new zeal and conviction I haven't felt in awhile.  I feel pretty happy about that.

      Okay, I'm really confused, and I can't actually post the details, although I've considered it.  School was pretty average today, we had a boys only meet against Seton Hall Prep, which we ofcourse lost, but at least I suprisingly got to swim, my second worst event!  The 400-Yd Relay!  Needless to say, I was slow as sin, although, I got a good flip-turn the first time, according to some people.  So, I guess all things considered I'm getting better, but still not good enough.

      Everyone wants to be different.  I've always thought about that, how everyone wants to stick out, and be the unique one, among all the boring, mundane and banal.  So, I really must say, I feel sorry for most white guys when they are in High school.  Nothing stands out about most of them by default, so they have to either accept that or go out and act real strange.  I guess it's the opposite way for me, I can't pinpoint exactly what I am, unless I believed in Pan-Africanism or something....  Then I had school.  It was pretty boring as usual.  Cotters class was interesting enough though, since we went over the state of the union, even though it is annoying when some people have a completely useless hatred of Bush, like a pure out blind hatred, that seems to have no actual grounding!  I walked home, talked with Doug, but most amazing of all is that I talked with two people I rarely ever talk to, and need to talk to more.  The first one, I'd rather not mention since that's a rather personal one, I'd rather not disclose.  The second being Kim, good to know we are heading back towards bluer skies, because I was seriously an ass to her for the better part of last year, and I really regret that.  Damn, I seriously need a haircut.

      Yo, just watched State of the Union Adress, Bush is a smart Repbulican, but I still hate Republicrats.  They can all die, I'm gonna have to go live in Nigeria or Ghana or something, pretend I know what I am..... Whoa, that's to deep for today maybe tommorow.  Oh, word.  My new phrase!  Anderes al guzes?  It means "Do you want my Dick?" in Armenian, and you say it when someone ask for to much.  Funny as sin.

      First Post in my new Blog, I assume it's more effective then using an actual journal.  I'm basically going to spout my future rhetoric here, whether it be my rampant problems with girls.  My moderately peaceful Socialism, or *gasp* things I notice about Black Suburban life.(Oh big scary word phrase!).  Or even my problems with religion (I'm still a Protestant though).  So, today, I have to watch the state of the Union adress for Mr. Cotters class.  That is gonna be serious Ick, at least I don't have practice so, I'll actually do some work.  I'm gonna take some survey now out of boredom and post to results so I appear special because I'm posting about stuff.  Okay, maybe not, I'm to lazy to.  Yoga, I need to take that when swim season is over!  There is a place in town that should teach it, but I'm not sure.... Arggg... Can't swim season freakin' end!!!

      I was so down at the start of the day.  Like I felt stress, and got bad vibes about the day.  So, I go to school and this one girl smiles at me, and is like "Hi, Marcus!" and I seriously felt so much better the entire day.  It was the weirdest thing, like I guess it really made me feel better to know that the Light of God really is in each of us.    In less serious news, I printed out a page from the FBI sponsored BBP coloring book, and everyone found that funny.  In spanish I ate my 55 that I got on my Spanish quiz, and told Mrs. Lawrence it tasted like failure, then she said everyone would get 5 points to it.... so apparently it tasted like a D.  I handled that one pretty well, even though it didn't get to me.  Whatever, I guess the little things can really make a person happy.  No matter how sappy that sounds.

      I'm a strange person.  I guess I'm always happy, thats why I'm strange. The only things that have even remotely come to stress me, are temporary.  I seriously thought about that in Math today, and was like, if their is a snow day or if their isn't I'm going to be happy, because whatever happens was meant to happen, so I should go along with it..... man.  I guess it's kind of strange.  The only thing that could possibly stress me is being wrong, and even then I'm getting used to it.  I guess a person always needs to be slightly stressed and have something eating at their soul, but what's eating at my soul right now isn't that big.    School was pretty funny today.  Mat seriously made me get sick to the stomach from laughing in Algebra today.  Besides all the things he said to Mr. V, he was rapping, it was so funny. He was like "My name is Matt, I represent the white nation.  My skin may be light but I'm hung like a Haitian!" that alone still has me going.  Well, whatever.  I have work to get done, and the burning in my soul is really eating away at me right now.

      I clicked a link and it earsed my really long entry...... Dios mio, I'm angry now..... I'm gonna find some Baha'i quote that I want to remember for the day.... and then get something from the Bible, and just publish the entry.  Never click links when you have something important open.... damn.  Alright, a Quote from "Divine Philosophy". Today the enmity and rivalry existing between the religions are over mere words. It is an established fact that the followers of all the religions believe in a reality, the benefits of which are universal; which reality is a medium between God and man. The Jews call that reality Moses, the Christians Christ, the Mussulmans Mohammed, the Buddhists Buddha and the Zoroastrians  156  Zoroaster. Now mark well that none of these religionists have ever seen the founders; they have only heard his name. Could they overlook these names they would at once realize that all believe in a perfect reality which is an intermediary between the Almighty and the creatures.  	(Abdu'l-Baha, Divine Philosophy, p. 155)  Okay, that's done.  Now a proverb from a book of the same name.  I guess God let this one stand out to me, because I didn't really take time to understand this ones meaning, but I felt I should post it.  9:6 Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of understanding.  	(King James Bible, Proverbs)  I'm officially a philosophical fanatic.  I really don't have much of a life, I'm all talk....

      A Baha'i girl IMed me recently.  We talked quite a bit, and she gave me a most wonderful program.  It allowed me access by my computer to all the Baha'i holy books (Their are quite a few), and other important writtings.  It also had the Bible, Apocraphya (spelled that wrong), Letters of Saints and other important writtings.  To make it even better it had four translations of the Qu'ran, and numerous other Islamic writtings.   It is such a great program, I'll post the link for it in my next entry.  I really hope they can add the Zoroaster books, Hindi, Buddhist and maybe some Gnostic books (I guess some of the Jewish writtings are arranged differently, but to my knowledge most of the supplementry works of the Prophets found it's way into the bible).    I found a very interesting bit of knowledge from Abdul'l'Baha in "Some Answered Questions" one of the most interesting religious texts I am sure.  He explains numerous things about his beliefs, and how to logically apply many of the principles.  This quote I am posting is about why newer messengers are sent down, because of religions becoming corrupt, I couldn't help but agree with it.  "Again, consider how much the principles of the religion of Christ have been forgotten, and how many heresies have appeared. For example, Christ forbade revenge and transgression; furthermore, He commanded benevolence and mercy in return for injury and evil. Now reflect: among the Christian nations themselves how many sanguinary wars have taken place, and how much oppression, cruelty, rapacity and bloodthirstiness have occurred! Many of these wars were carried on by command of the Popes. It is then clear and evident that in the passage of time religions become entirely changed and altered. Therefore, they are renewed."  	(Abdu'l-Baha, Some Answered Questions, p. 166)  Wow, it even puts the writter and the page number for you.... That's convient.  I'm still quite iffy on considering converting, I really would need to read more, being the odd Christian I am.    The way I'm talking, it'd seem like I didn't even return from vacation today and did anything in school.  School was quite interesting today, it was perhaps the perfect day, because everything went how it was supposed.  I didn't go to far with anything, or get to bored, it was great.  I guess, perhaps most importantly, getting a 20/20 on the Cotter paper, that I thought sucked made my day, but who knows.  I'm just glad the day went so well, and I was able to crack a joke about the Black History Month Assembly being the most angry one of the year.   I'm such a strange person, I really need to be socially active after 4:00 (especially on a Friday).  I noticed how (crap I'm still talking) I always talk about doing stuff, but never do anything.  I guess I really am a person who is all talk but no movement, which really isn't that much of a suprise to me.

      Haven't updated all vacation week.    Yesterday, I went to my Aunts school (McKinney Place) to help here with her Grade K class, it was pretty fun, but most of those kids are really, really stupid. I don't even think some of those kids were even self aware, and it was really grinding away at my aunts, and many of the other teachers sanity.  I don't blame them, it only made me further want to be an Elementry school teacher though, not enough males (especially African-American males) teach the lower grades and as J. Kunjufu noted that is a serious problem.     I've gotten into some Reggea recently, and even found a good group for Swahili rap called  Kalamashaka, even though I've only heard one of their songs "Tafsiri hii" (Explain this), which is their most popular song, and I guess it kind of reflects a different mood in Africa.  Where rappers here, who are conscious talk about racial problems, these guys talk about government problems and stuff.  They said some verse like " (forget the word) hapana(no)! Polisi.... Hapana!" It's pretty cool.  And then Beenie Man and Bounty Killah, best Dancehall reggea I've heard in ages, it gives me new respect for dancehall.

      Black History Breakfast today.  The speaker was pretty good, but the food at Casta Del Soul sucks, since all the NCNW women are so delicate, they couldn't eat anything with salt, sugar, probubly vitamin A, and if it was a vegetable it was bad to.  So, it ends up we get like an English serving of potatoes, the driest piece of beef, two turkey sausages and nasty powder tasting eggs.  The speaker made up for this though, because the way she talked really played to my emotions, especially talking about the child abuse cases.  A suprising lack of talking about the war, even though she alluded to that, since all people are thinking about that now.  In the spirit of that, I found the funniest quiz on Quizilla, that needs to be more popular.    you are the ultimate homey. you're so black. mMmMm KFC. keep it real nigga. holla.    urlLink      `?!?!?!HOw BLACK are yOu?!?!     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      I'm full of regret right now.  I was talking to Kim last night about how my priorities are divided, and now that I've proven that, I really feel like an ass.  I had hoped Thomas would be getting a ride today, so I wouldn't have to worry about dividing my attention (or being selective) by walking home with Thomas and Kim who both live in the same general area.  It ended up Thomas didn't get a ride, but by that time, it was around 3:10, and I was convinced I'd wait for Kim.  So, I waited until 3:30ish, and Kim comes out from Mrs. Sommers, Thomas is still their of course pushing me along, trying to make me leave, now of course, weather makes me irritable, so I guess I sounded pretty rude towards Thomas.  After three blocks or so he just turned down the street, and walked the more direct way to his house.  I really felt bad after that, I've been divided over whether I should write it down, because I haven't felt so much regret in a very long time.  I don't even know if their is a resolution here, I'll think over break.  Maybe the Black History Breakfast tommorow will make me feel better.

      I finally got that AP Stat test out of the way.  It wasn't to bad, I wanted to walk home though but it was to damn cold.  So, I went to my Aunts house, and talked about helping her with her class.  Fun stuff, I hope I can do that Wednesday or something.  That'd be great.  I really live a  pretty boring life though, like the egg drop was the height of my day, and that was at the start.  Whooop.    foot    urlLink   What's YOUR sexual fetish?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    I cheated to get this result, but it's funny as hell.    Oh, I'm also the idealistic virgin.

      I can see why certain things are so addicting.  Looking at the Dead Prez video "Hip-Hop" I can never get over one of the Posters for the Indpum.  I can't even read all of it, but I can see "Resistance", "Genocide" and "Liberate African People".  That alone is such an addicting idea, and the hand holding up the spears only adds to that.  It makes it almost understandable why such ideas as Nazism were able to catch on easily.  Coming to "defense" of your own people even if their is no problem, always has a strong calling.  I really need to get out more, and not take that damn AP Stat test....

      Finished my Egg drop project! Yes.  Now I actually need to accomplish something worthwhile.  I spent most of my day after the egg drop, just writting my story, which I'm never going to finish, but it nice enough to write anyway.

Nia trying to do her ghetto sistah voice. 3. Travis, doing any action.  THREE THINGS I LOVE: 1. The internet 2. Angry minorities 3. I guess I should say the Bible.  THREE THINGS I HATE: 1.

      Church was so annoying today.  Mrs. Boggle, is obsessed that Kum Ba Yah, is in "African".  Besides the fact that Africans haven't ever got around to speaking the same 200 languages, I almost freaked out then, but she refuses to see it's actually English (Gullah I'm almost positive).  She can't notice the similarities between Come by Here, and Kum Ba Yah.   I mean.... Dios!  Come--> Kum, stressing the vowel oddly.  Ba --> Dropping the "Y" sound infavor of using it in the next word (even though some people say Bay-yah), and Yah although it doesn't sound like hear, it's imaginable in speak.  'ts right ova yah.    Whatever.... I don't get out enough.  Every other journal in existence is usually about people going out and doing stuff... no not me.  I'm a little Computer boy, who would become a shriveled husk without the net.  I seriously should have gone to Jamnesty yesterday.

      Finally.  This computer has been down for like a week, since whenever my father goes out fo state all electronics stop working.  He got it back up, but I can't find the damn video driver.  So, I have to restrict my activites to the internet.  Oh well, I'm still glad I have a computer in the corner to work on again.  I really don't want to think about my egg drop project, school is so boring.....

      Strangest thing, my computer deleted all my previous settings, passwords, and other stuff.  I though I'd disabled to function in 8th grade...  It's not really much of a problem for me though.  I was sick today, I could tell I was going to be last night, but suprisingly I'm already recovered, even though I sadly won't be able to swim in the meet tommorow.... Oh well, the season has been good to me anyway.  I guess it's the way life goes about.  I gotta dig up a quiz to take now, so I can post the results.      urlLink  What Was Your PastLife?    Word, that makes sense.  I love the picture in the survy, with the person going through the cycle of life, and then returning to Brahma, I love that type of art.  Almost as cool as Arabian, and Egyptian Art.  Ayyam-i-ha is in 22 days, if I want to do anything to see what Baha'i is like, I really, really should go to New York, and check it out.  Hopefully it will be a very fun, and entertaining holiday.

      Religion is alive for me once again. I've been talking to all sorts of people, and for some reason hearing all the voices talk about God, no matter what religion, has just made me happy.  I really don't know why.  My father has just left for Texas for the week, to take some class on something.  I'm not sure what it actually is, but it'll be a relief not to have to deal with his insane amount of nagging, and nagging and nagging.  Oh, and also in the world of reality Swim season is only four more days for me!  That's only two more practices!  Then I'll be free to procastinate even more, and lose my wonderfully sexy, well toned, body that I've worked so hard to get.  Even though, I still don't have giant pecks (My chest is like a damn piece of paper) , or how ever that's spelled.   Ummm.....  Ga.

                    According to the SelectSmart.com Belief System Selector, my #1 belief match is  Liberal Quakers.    What do you believe?     Visit    SelectSmart.com/RELIGION          I sort of expected this to be my number one match, since in theory, it's the religion that gives me the most mobility of thought without having to worry about the good of my immortal soul.  I guess, that's slightly re-assuring even though, I'm still pretty attracted towards Baha'i which was the religion I agree with like 80 % which would put it at third (Mainline to Liberal Protestant was my second).  I guess, comparitive religion would be something good to take in college.    Dreams of Heaven  Last Night, I had a dream. A dream. A dream of heaven.  In it, I saw a city. A city with roads that,  were always smoothe. A city, where it was always day. A city, where I never saw anyone asking for money. A city, where the town hall was a work of pure art. A city, where all houses were beautiful. A city, where everyone was rich, and never went hungry.  But, I cried, when I saw the city. A city, with no temples. A city, with no prayer. A city, without a soul. A city, where money was all anyone loved.  And then, I truly saw,  for when I said "Oh God!" It rang hollow. It rang silent. It rang with my sorrow!  For, I knew  where I was, apart from God, from hope,  and from Faith. I was in Hell.

      Oh man.  Today was Nia's birthday.  Great stuff.  Went to Willow Brook Mall, brought some Quaker book and "Lets Get Free" finally.  I got Nia this funny Bill Cosby CD as a birthday present, as a joke of course.  I'm such a joker.  This weekend kinda sucked though.  Friday, I went to some Hotel in Newark to go to some weird sort of 115th anniversy for my Grandmother's church.  It was so boring, damn black people give away to many things (This has a double meaning).  So that really sucked, but I've played WarcraftIII all weekend so it didn't matter.  Saturday was that damn play rehearsal, arrggg!!!  I hate Easter plays.  It's crap like this that makes me want to detach myself from all the other youths in my church. I have seriously taken big rolls in the plays for the past 4 or maybe 5 years.  Sick of it, only suprise is I'm not the oldest since Paul is in it also.  Thank God! But has like 4 lines.  I have 4 pages.  Mungu Mzuri! Sinaiomba hii!!! Haha.  Bi-lingualness.

      I managed to self motivate myself today.  I've never done that before so easily.  Generally, when I'm depressed I'd go to other people to solve it, but I managed to solve it internally.... It was almost to strange.  I guess it's a sign that my weird beliefs are actually giving me some stability.

      It's so much harder then it seems.  I just need to knock on the damn door and it will be opened for me, and for some reason I'm afraid to knock!  Testing today was intereting enough, it really didn't stress me at all.  Infact, I'm rather happy.  So, I spit in your face world.  Not litterally though.   I realized I'm more or less stuck in a Religious triangle.  In my times of greatest spiritual power, I think Quaker, in my times of greatest pluralism, I'm Baha'i, and in my moments of Atheism/Agnosticsm I'm Gnostic-Pantheistic.  The problem is that I'm quite sure that the Gnostic-Pantheist view, is going to become secular pantheism.... and my religious world will probubly only shirnk.  What a shame.  A shame. Adieu Adieu.    On a bright note, Ryan told me to try out for FNL next year and he was really pushing for me to be in it.  That made me feel warm and fuzzy inside.  Ryan is so cool, with his tallness, and his tight 80's band shirts for a type of music I've never listened to in my life.

      I can't even go to Che lives without being bombarded by every post from talking about Che to talking about Socialist theory and how it relates to the war in Iraq.

      Thought.  I was reading a Pantheist board on belief.net, one person brought up an especially good point.  They said, the Universe was the same thing as God, which I kind of believed, then a person said they didn't need to believe in afterlife they'd existed since the begginning of time.  There is no need for people to have souls, we've always existed as part of the Universe and even when we die we are still part of it, just not held together by conscious.  My old view of things had been that we were already dead, from the second we were born, but this view is that we always were, and always will be alive.  Nice outlook.  Modern religions are great.

      Man this weekend sucked.  If it wasn't from that Pagels book I would have gone crazy! Sadly I've finished it, so I gotta tote that Nag Hammadi book around school, and only make myself seem weirder. Oh well, I don't really care.  World is a lie.  Wisdom is truth.  Hehe.   I hate the Easter Play.... Gahhh... It's brought me so much damn stress.

      I wasn't feelin' it today.  I don't know what I was feelin' but it wasn't what I wanted.  I guess I'm stressed/angry at having to do so much stuff that I'm just expected to do.  I am so tired of having to act good, and do this and that without being asked as a courtesy and not being thanked.  It drives me insane.  I almost can't deal.  I really just need to read, that always clears my mind.  Today sucked. I'm tired, and need sleep, before this friday saps away all my energy.

      It ends up I am a selected Sophmore who has to re-take the English section in entirety.  Because I scored three points to low on one section.  I hate standardized test.  It doesn't really matter though, sure I don't like it, but I can easily deal with it.  It's not the end of the world or anything, and I still get thursday late, so its all good.  I guess this has been further alleviated by the fact that I got my Nag Hammadi Library and "The Gnostic Gospels"!  I am so happy, I started reading the Gnostic Gospels, it is so good and informative.  I love Elaine Pagels, I wonder if she actually is Gnostic or is just a good speaker on the Gnostic theories.    Protest was today.  It seemed like a bad idea, and I didn't participate.  I'm glad I didn't, firstly it's purpose was weakend by people using it as an excuse to cut school. Secondly, it was preaching to the choir.  People can talk about their voices being heard, but just because your voices aren't emancipated, they are still saying the same things.  We already know that prejudices of our parents have rubbed off onto us.  So few people actually support the war in the area, that protesting is silly.  Who protest what others around m alra see?  Come to think of it, yeah, your voice wouldn't be heard because it sounds the same as everyone elses.

      Yes! It ends up that only selected Sophmores have to take the New Standards!!!! I get to come in late again! I'm so happy about that, that I can look into the future and smile just as much as I'm smiling now.  Now if only my NHL would arrive everything would be perfect.    Clay told me today, they didn't accept me into FNL because they would have had two short skinny black guys, to much confusion.  I don't know how I'm supposed to take that.  I think, I'll just read "African World Revolution" that'll clear my mind for awhile.  I wonder why it's not spelled all Assata Shakur like (Afrika), oh well.  I don't really care.

      Whoa... Just thought of something.  Paul was going to Damascus, and he suddenly realized something about God.  That's probubly what struck him dumb....  Oh also, can't forget this.  God seems to be pretty evil in the OT..... perhaps this represents how people abuse the concept of God? I really should be writting this upstairs, but I'm to lazy.  Sorry, had to write that somewhere.

      Interesting day.  We got our student ID's.  I honestly don't like them, and think they are a bad idea, but instead of being the typical teen that only embraces change on their part, I tried to look at things slightly more objectively.  That's what I do after all.  In the short-term, I hate them.  They are a change from my already fine routine, to combat something that I'm unfamiliar with.  Then again, if one really looks at it properly, they'll realize they aren't going to go away, and most teachers will stop being so anal over them.  They'll get sick of complaining about this, just like they are sick of complaining about hats.  Whatever.  It's bad, but only because it's something new coming from someone we generally are diametrically (always wanted to use that) opposed to.  I had an interesting dream, from maybe 5:30 AM- 6:50AM this morning.  After I woke up from the repeated swim team wake up times from my alarm clock, I fell into a semi-shallow sleep.  I generally dream my strongest dreams in this semi-shallow form of sleep.  I'm a strong believer that dreams tell us something, I used to think they were something else speaking to us, but then I realized how deep a persons mind can actually get.  My dream, this time, is easy to explain here because it highlights a common fear among people.  I hate, knowing that I'm trapped for a certain amount of time to an obligation I brought upon myself, as well as the anxiousness that comes out of that.    Anyway, on to the dream.  My dream was that it was late June, and I had gone to camp early this year (I suddenly remember having numerous camp dreams, but none as strong as this since this one can bring back memories of other dreams).  It's already starting to fade, but I went to camp and no one had went.  Not even Nia.  No girls were their, except the ones who no one cares about.  Kevin was my councilor (my favorite one) and he was like "Guys, this really sucks." and it was just like me and Adam S.  Needless to say that made me depressed and made me feel trapped.  Suddenly, I was pulled out of camp because I needed to finish my final exams, which I missed by being at camp.  It gave me a feeling of regret, of needing to go back to camp (just remember another camp dream), but also a feeling of happiness to have escaped from the three weeks of being utterly bored.    Thinking about that more, it reflects a few things.  I felt this way through most of the camp session last summer.  I dwelled on the fact that most of the girls I wanted to talk to weren't there (except Sonya if she reads this) and a lot of the thrill from before was gone (I didn't sneak into a cabin once that year, besides that time we pretended to be terrorist...).  This was magnified a x100 in my dream, to the point where I see it as a fear of hating my obligations I can't back out of, and the anxiousness for stuff to just end.  The feeling I'd want to throw away 3 weeks of my life, so I could go back to doing nothing.  This suddenly brings up images of the Easter Play at church, except the emotion is more muted, and I believe that the emotion was trying to come forward in this dream.  Hmmm... I really shouldn't interpret my dreams where everyone can just read them.... oh well.

      Today was pretty nice for a Sunday.  After I returned from Chruch, which is oddly capitalized, I went to Sarah's house to work on a history project it was interesting enough.  I really don't care much about that, it was me denying a ride, and deciding to walk home that brought me real joy.  I rarely ever walk that way anymore, and it brought me great joy to see all sorts of views, and people along the way.  I was very happy as a result.  So at Chruch I had a little conundrum, to quote "Love and a bullet".  It ends up our church is now entering into a business partnership with a local carribean resturant.  Our church will be giving coupons for it, and the resturant would tithe, that is give 10% of their profits to the church.  This is bad because the church is getting involved with a business for a pure monetary purpose, but then again the good point is they are supporting a black buisiness in a logical partnership.  I don't know what to think of the entire situation, I guess that's what makes it a conundrum.  Even stranger, I was at Dunkin' Donuts and I heard this guy speaking in Arabic, and I understood him.  I was so happy, all my wasted hours let me understand a Middle Easterner saying "No, Praise God".  Oh well.

      I don't like Saturdays.  They remind me of the lack of action on Friday.  I'm seriously just sitting here listening to Ward of the State 2 by Askari X, I'm so bored I'm going to write the lyrics down and send them to Ohhla.com.   Even though the song ends in what seems to be the middle.  Community service was crazy, there was like 30 people in our section of the food bank, and it was really a small section but it was cool because their were lots of girls there.  What was really funny though, is their was these 10 or so black guys/men who were lifting all the boxes, and then these four white kids came over to help, but they were like small and these black guys were pretty big.  It looked kinda funny..... But I have a weird sense of humor.

      More thoughts I needed to put down before I forget them.  In Spanish we were working on our scripts and I was reading it with Laura, and over dramatizing it.  I sounded really evil at the end, and mumbled stuff off in Spanish, then slowly switched over to Swahili rambling.  I said something like Nataka Mbuzi, all evil sounding, and Obed started to laugh.  He was like "You want a goat?" That was pretty funny, because everyone else was like huh?  The other thing was about Buddhism, I guess most people don't realize that most religions preach the same thing practically.  I've seen that inner peace stuff in Hinduism, Gnosticism, Heremeticsm, even some in Qaballah....  Whatever, I'm to into weird stuff for my own good.  By the time I'm twenty I'll be into Aleister Crowley type of BS, and be able to summon angels by speaking Enochian or something weird like that.  All this weird stuff that exist....

      I love books.  The first thing I'm going to do when I buy a house, is devote a large portion of it to being a study.  I need to buy so many books.  I want to just re-arrange my room to make space on the shelves, so I can store decent stuff on it.  I really am the most spur of the moment type of guy though.  I guess, this rush is in response to not getting into AP Spanish, actually, I'm on the waiting list.  Speaking of which, it was really funny today in Spanish.  Laura runs in and was like "Senora! Senora! You estoy en AP!!!" and Mrs. Lawrence was like "Laura, es 'soy'!" and she started to laugh, it was pretty funny, considering how excited Laura was.   Okay, I better stop writting and eat something.  I'm pretty hungry.

      Wow, I want to post this early, while its still fresh in my mind.  Everything in life that is good, for me, seems to be met by an equal loss.  I guess, then, it's far easier to view my life as always being good then.  I waited all day to check the cast list for FNL, and I didn't get in.  I was almost sure I did, oh well.  It didn't irk me to much, because Liza got in.  She danced, didn't make any jokes.  The judges overall let in who they wanted in, and I knew that.  My only hope would be they wanted me more.  Oh well, only one black guy in FNL then.    Of course my gain was much more personal, suffice to say I was talking to a friend and it ends up, things may be falling in my favor if worked right.  Hopefully they will be.  I don't want to say much more on that strand though.

      I'm still happy.  So many peoples journals have the darkest most depressing colors.  Personally, if I knew HTML, I'd have the RBG flag as my background.... oh well.  RBG is cool even without me sporting it.  School was pretty cool today, I held myself together pretty well, considering I had lost my lab, but I figured it was in my locker, and yes, good lord, it was.  I tried out for FNL yesterday.  I think it went pretty well, being a minority automatically makes me more funny then Seinfield I guess, but that's not exactly saying a helluva lot.  It was really fun though, I really do hope I got in, but as has been proven worrying proves nothing.  I will either get in or will not get in, either way is what is supposed to happen and since I don't have any control of the situation, I'll be glad with either one.  Haha, Cop Shot just came onto my song list.  I'm gonna post the lyrics, it's so funny, yet so addictive to listen to.  Cop Shot By Dead Prez  (sound of 41 gunshots)  Pump pump pump All Malcolm X massive  (revolution man hold tight soldier ) All rudeboy, hold tight  (M-1) Cop SHOT, cop shot, cop shot, cop shot Keep shooting my people, we will shoot back Me bring the M-1 you bust the Glock ra-ta-bum-bum  on you like that 1-8-7 pon undercover COP Another dead pig knocked straight off my BLOCK Cop shot, cop shot,  cop shot Black cop, white cop, all cop  (stic.man) Every police is a punk ass bitch this is for my niggas in the streets getting frisked Gun to your head handcuffs on your wrists everywhere we at we gotta start to resist Black po' people  get no JUSTICE the courts, the judge, and the jury is fixed every ghetto you go, sick of this shit throw up your fist if you sick of this shit  (M-1) The only good cop is a dead cop police brutality must come to a STOP Dem kill Latinos dem kill more black Luima in Brooklyn, Diallo in the BRONX We spark rebellion, watch them get ROCKED self-defense is not a violent act Police MURDER budget get cut back Guilliani send his troops to ATTACK they soon retreat watch them run back  cop shot, cop shot, cop SHOT cop shot, cop shot, cop SHOT  buck, buck, buck, buck, BUCK  (stic.man) These ghetto eyes of mine ain't blind no more I'm getting ready  for guerilla war Cuz it's coming Y2K computer glitch Start running, cuz you the snitch You can catch two in yo s-t I'm not a sellout Let every nigga in a cell out I don't hate playas I hate the mayors and the police commissioners governors and senators turning my people into junkies and prisoners I rock  for the folks that's locked to break that lock It feel good when I hear Jake got shot we can take this block if you really want it Call the People's Army if you really on it I seen enough shit to turn your heart cold Life is like walking  barefoot on hot coals  (M-1) (unnngghhh) Here's a government policy: no justice, no democracy (uunnnggghhh) this a modern day slavery fire pon all country (?)  cop SHOT, cop shot, cop shot, cop shot black cop, white cop ALL COP  whoop! whoop! that's the sound of the Beast ??? dying in the street lick a shot at ?? no justice, no peace!  the real .to all my niggas in the field  all rudebwoy, lick a shot! hold tight!  something real for your radio ( ____ ?) we keep it raw for your video (ya can't test it) DP's in your stereo Motherf-kers don't hear me though  (woman's voice "Hooo" repeatedly) buck, buck, buck buck!

      Man, I guess I'm happy.  I feel like I'm forgetting something and I'm about to go to sleep without having done any homework like usual.  I'd think it was history, but the Test is Tuesday... So what did I forget?  Whatever, it's not worth worrying over.  Tommorow only happens once, may as well face it.  Sunday school was pretty funny, because Mr. Harewood, accidently implied how evil Gnosisticsm was.  That was pretty funny, because it made me cringe.  Then Mrs. Smith was telling all the little kids the purpose of Lent, and was talking about how Jesus was tempted by the devil.  That really made me think..... Why would the devil offer Jesus the earth if God, and by extension Jesus created it.  It made me think of the Gnosistic idea that the creator of Earth is actually evil, and God is completely different.  So if the creator of the Earth, I don't know how metaphorically to take it, was offering Jesus his world, it would make far more sense.... who knows.  Gnosistic writtings will drive a poor Christian crazy.  I shoul've just gone to an Abyssinian church when I had the chance.  Wow, only the most hardcore Christians can probubly understand what I'm actually saying.  Man, I really need to stop being so serious though.  I'm alienating myself more then I should.

      It's early Sunday, I'm listening to Cop Shot, just saw a great musical.  Read some stuff, but I have this burning anger I need to channel out of myself, so I can feel happy again.    Oh! Where did I leave my soul? I want to show you what's inside! Oh! Where did I leave my soul? Not in my country, because I was not from here. But then Where!  Oh! Where did I leave my soul? Austria? No. France? No. Oh! Where did I leave my soul? Brazil? No. Hawaaii? No. Oh! Where did I leave my soul? Alabama? No. Manhattan? No.  So, where is mine? I want to show it to you. So, where is mine? I'm sure my sparkles just as brightly. So, where is mine? If your soul is beauty, what am I without one?  Where? Where? Where? Where is my soul?  Oh! God where is my soul!  I guess I turned the anger into sadness, but I lost my original message.

      Going in to school late rules.  To bad tommorow is the last day I'll get to do that for awhile, probubly won't get to do it again until finals, damn.  It doesn't really matter to much, I've felt happy lately, and I guess in the long run to me being happy is the be all and end all.  I started to read the Gospel of Thomas, I seriously need to buy the rest of the Gnostic Books, they have some pretty heavy sayings of Jesus, much better then the ones in the Gospel.  No wonder the early church tried to burn these books......  6) His disciples questioned Him and said to Him, "Do you want us to fast? How shall we pray? Shall we give alms? What diet shall we observe?" Jesus said, "Do not tell lies, and do not do what you hate, for all things are plain in the sight of Heaven. For nothing hidden will not become manifest, and nothing covered will remain without being uncovered."  -"Gospel of Thomas"  Anyway.  I really need to work on my social life, I'm a little to in the clouds for my own good.

      Meh... Thomas wanted to get mentioned.  Well he was talking his new age mumbo jumbo about Tarot and the secerets of the cards.... First time I've actually understood what being religiously intolerant meant, haha!  Spirituality is quite strange, I need to read some of the Gnostic Gospels perhaps, maybe also read up on some Baha'i stuff.... Such strangeness.  I'm glad I get to go in late tommorow.

      Music Marathon today.  Fun stuff.  I bought MoO3, but it's confusing.  I need to play it more to get the hang of it.  Besides that nothing special really happened today.  I started to read "The Joy of Sects" yesterday, but it's so boring at points.  I guess I'm pretty boring, when I look at it, even though on the surface I had a lot of fun.... Just not enough.  Oh something weird.  My parents think I was friends with Liza W. in Preschool or something, even though I can't remember who she is at all.  I dunno, weird stuff.

      Another entry in the continuing "Dialogue of Thomas with the Savior".    It was the third year, after the Saviors ascension, when I had been approached by the hypocrites of the Temple.  They questioned me, and made me lament over many things.  It was that night that I sat awaiting the voice of the Savior.  He came to me on the Third hour.  "Why do you lament in my namesake?" The Savior spoke to me.  "I fear many things of the flesh, when you only spoke of the spirit.  What of the old laws? The old ways?"  I questioned Him.  The Savior became silent, and I sat for another three hours in complete silence, until the Savior returned to me.  "You already know these answers.  Do not lie to yourself, and always know your own face." Upon hearing this, I grew confused and answered him in frustration.  "Lord, again, you speak of how to make myself strong in spirit, but how do I follow the laws of the temple?" The Savior left me again, and again for three hours I sat in silence.  The Savior returned to me.  "The Pharisees do not speak of your Temple, for God does not live in only one Temple."  With this the Savior dissappeared again.  I sat for three more hours, but this time the Savior did not need to return, for I realized that he'd never left.   I changed it to reflect a different feeling.

      Spanish Video was shown today.  People loved it.  New Message Board, it cuts off some text, oh well.  Worked on a project with Allie, Neema and Sarah. Finished filming my part, editing will be done.  Two subs today.  What more could I ask for?  Great day.  No need to even speak fancy of it.  Baha'i stuff is so hard not to read.

      Okay now really.  I was sitting in the car yesterday, and something odd just came to me.    As I, Thomas who am called doubting, sat talking to Jesus, in his last days before my ressurection, He explained to me the ways to the Kingdom of the Father. He said unto me "When man can make two-and-two into three and of those three combine them as one, then he shall find passage into the kingdom of the father." Being an doubting man, I questioned him saying "But Lord, Why do not the rituals of the priest reflect this?" The Lord answered me, "Oh ye of little knowledge!  You look to the sky for the father, and ritual for his voice!  Surely man is not buried in the ground because God is closer to the ground, nor do the birds fly in the sky to be closer to God.  For if two-and-two were made into the three-and-one on Earth, then why would man need to look for God?"  At this moment the words of the Savior became clear to me and I understood, and the way to the place where the Saints live became clear to me if only for a second.   This isn't exactly what came to me.  Only the first "quote" of "Jesus" came to me like that, and I thought of elaborating it a bit, to resemble a passage from  The Gospel of Thomas .  It makes me wonder if that Gospel really was quoting Jesus.

      Haha.  Talking in Swahili is so fun.    Me-  Haya, Saa kwa Kiswahili. RA, Umesoma na Umefunda kwa "Teach Yourself: Swahili" je? Ikiwa Tutasema Kiswahili hapa, Tanafunda tena.   RebelAfrika-  Hapana. Ninajifunza Kiswahili kwa Mwalimu "Ika" pa Chuo Kiku cha Compton.  Sinafahamu. Im still "very much" at a beginners level...forgive me when I don't understand.   Haha.  He's pretending I don't suck at Swahili.  I invented that grammer.   Dead Prez has finally started to release songs for their Sophmore Album.  Great stuff, but they sound to ready for the revolution in the stuff.  Makes me wanna burn an American Flag (or put up an Esperanto flag because those are happy).  Speaking of which, I really do mean that "Mi frandzis via patrino".  Ofcourse that implies I only did "that" to one persons mother.... So assume I'm speaking you my one reader.

      So here is every Marcus fans non-dry dream.  Day 1 (Good Friday 18th of April 2003)- Peliculas y Llegar por la Viaje  	So, technically our day started off at 2 AM.  Me and Nia watched the Ring, scared the crap outta me (Ive seen it in the theatre) Nia was barely shaken though.  She says maybe Ringu will scare her.  I finished packing two things, then we both fell asleep watching Platinum.  It was alright, but it cant last on UPN, because they gotta hold themselves back on that channel.  	Anyway, mom woke us up around 4:30ish, and Mr. Spence drove us to the airport.  We got through all the boring stuff really easy.  Took a plane to St. Louis, all boring nothing really to note about that flight.  I didnt even see anything nice.  We got off at SL, went to buy souveniors (pues, no me) and then went to Cinnabon.  I got sick from eating those things. Then after we got on the plane to Cancun.  It was pretty boring as well, and I was able to force myself to sleep, until we arrived close to Cancun, when I started looking out at the ocean, until we passed near the shallow waters, the hotels, and then town.  We landed, and went through customs (Oldivemos las formas), but it took awhile.  I saw Liza Wengner and Carly Brodsky, weird.  Then we met the travel guy, who spoke nice English and I said my only Spanish of the day muy pocito when he asked if we spoke Spanish.  Went to the Hotel, another family was in the van and they spoke Spanish as well.   	 	We finally got to the Hotel, had a problem getting our room and then we waited for a bit.  Some kids ran up to the lady at the counter, and started yelling stuff at her in Spanish about there room and the key.  She quickly answered.  I began to realize that Chicanos come here (Cancun) for vacation as well (Debo parce que cuando la pilot habla en Espanol).  When we got our room, me and Nia changed and went down to the beach.  Jumped around some, and then ate dinner.  We got back to the room around six, and I decided it was time to sleep some more.  So I kept waking up and falling asleep until it was the next day.  Day 2- Timeshares y ir de comprar!  	Today was much more interesting, one could say.  We started off the day by going to a free breakfast that was promised to us at the Moon Palace Hotel, it was pretty nice, and our host Roberto would show us around afterwards.  We talked about casual stuff until we were all finished eating.  Then he started comparing buying stock in the MPH with buying a timeshare.  Blah, blah. After many trials and tribulations we went to see the palatial presidential suite, which was quite nice, if a little excessive and their huge mile long snaking pool.  Then came the business part where he tried to have his boss sell us this quasi-timeshare.  His boss unfortunately was an old white man who looked like he burned easily.  His attitude was similar to his appearance, and despite how good the offer may have sounded we fortunately were not sold.  He then had his Latin boss try to sell us.  It didnt work either.  So regardless we got money for cabs back to the hotel and free t-shirts.  Waste of time? 	Afterwards, we returned to the hotel and went out to the beach and splashed around, then lied on the lawn chairs where I fell into deepthinking and I felt a feeling of hatred of the trip.  It was very strange.  Then ofcourse came the days other main event the mall.  It was pretty boring, all the stores were ultra-capitalistic clothe stores.  So I stayed mostly out of them.  Ask me about the Spanish man and girl who approached me and proved I cant speak Spanish under pressure. All in all though, the day was good.  Day 3- Chichen Itza  	I hate heat.  Mexicans are extremely strong if they can live in this unbearable heat. Today we went to Chichen Itza its an old Mayan city, with tons of ruins, but the ride there was interesting .  We needed to get up real early, to take a long bus ride.  Most of the people on the bus spoke Spanish, and were from varied countries.  It was especially weird to have girls from Costa Rica on vacation here (in Mexico).  We stopped a lot, first to a store where a guy around my age had a nice sales pitch of saying dude.    	Then we visted a Mayan village, that was pretty fun.  It was also depressing at the same time.  I saw some girls with kids dressed in some major brand of fresh new jeans in an old looking sunbaked house, without windows and kids in rags.  I hate capitalism.  	Finally after more crap.  We arrived at Chichen Itza and went on tour.  Our guide was great but the British people with us were so dumb and asked the dumbest questions (was the blood real or symbolic?)  After they had left we finished off the tour, and me, Nia and Dad did the dumb thing of climbing the pyramid.  It was a long way up and getting down was so hard, it scared the crap outta me.  Finally after all that we went to the bus, and dad was the last one on due to major CP time.  We drove home, most of the people sleeping and got back to the hotel.  Pictures say a thousand words.  Day 4- Tuluum and Xel-ha (and some racism?)  	The day started the same as yesterday, woke up early and went to the bus.  It was a similar bus except most of the people on it spoke English this time.  Not half and half.   We stopped only at once rest stop where they did this cool thing of crafting obsidian, the stuff can cut class apparently.  Pictures speak louder then words.  After that we went to Tuluum which was a Mayan  city from during the end of Pre-hispanic times.  The guide was a Mayan, but he said only the lower class of Mayans has survived.  I didnt like the site as much as Chichen Itza, but it was pretty cool.  Especially some of the designs on the buildings.  	Then we went to a tourist trap, I guess it could count for an amusement park of sorts, it was called Xel-ha (shelha) some weird Mayan word.  The only thing I wanted to do was snorkel though, and snorkel I did.  One could get a raft or just  swim with or w/o a life jacket.  I choose neither knowing theyd only seek to inhibit me.  It was pretty fun, their was one point where you could jump two or three meters off a cliff into the water, and afterwards scale the cliff.  Me and Nia did both, while at the same time dad got into an argument with this Spanish guy over Nias inner tube.  Then one of the workers their came over to my dad and started asking if he made a deposit.  Assuming the guy was telling the worker all this in Spanish, it was annoying how he took his side in believing my father was a thief while his wife had the inner tube, and my dad was trying to tell him.  My father was rightfully pretty pissed, and we left that area and continued along the course.  We finished the course shortly after.  We ate dinner, and then got on the bus and went home.  I got back to the hotel in time to watch BP but it wasnt on.  American Idol was.  I was gonna cry, because the guy joked about people tuning into watch BP.  Gah!  Read the something from Thunder: Perfect Mind weird hymn apparently its related to the writings in the Gitas/ Upashanids then the Judeo-Christian stuff.  Religion never leaves me.   Day 5-  Viaje a Isla de las Mujeres y Two drunk Gay guys  	Today, fun stuff.  We went on our free timeshare trip.  It was to Isla Mujeres, this small Island off the coast of Quintana Roo.  It felt a lot like Marthas vineyard.  The first place we stopped was a beach town.  We had a choice of expensive activities, but me and dad didnt feel like paying so we went and got some free food instead.  The food was pretty good, and then I started talking with the cook there he looked about 17 to 20.  And he told me I looked like a New Yorker.  Funny.  	Went to sleep after that, Nia and Mom were lounging on the beach so I follow suite and slept for about two hours.  From about twelve to two.  We got on the boat afterwards, and went up the Island. Fortunately dad was able to get us on a snorkeling expedition.  So when we got to the North of the island we got on a small fishing boat.  Two guys were there.  One driving the boat, the other diving with us.  My father asked if others were coming and if they were men or women.  The guy looked confused and said neutral I thought it was because he didnt know.  	It ended up the other two guys were drunk gay latinos.  They got on the boat after finishing way to many tequilas.  It didnt help that they talked with high voices in English,  but also drunk voices.  Quite funny.  Ask me to do my impression of them.  When we got in, I being a minor, had to wear a life jacket.  It was still great, and may dad almost had a heart-attack from the excitement of seeing some many barracuda.  I didnt realize they were canivorus so they just looked like big fish to me.  It was fun, and we got back on the boat.  Where the drunk Cuban was talking about how he never swam before and it was like a perrito he tried to explain it in English without being blunt.  My dad didnt understand fortunately.  Im not gonna make him aware.  	Afterwards we got back on shore.  Rented a golf cart, picked up Nia and Mom and started to drive around.  My dad let me drive, but I almost crashed the thing.  So he continued to drive, and I took pictures.  Stuff would have slowed down when we returned the cart and got back on the boat back to Cancun, but the guys on the boat had a party.  It was insanity for such a small boat.  I even got a shot of tequila it was watered down.  My father was right, even though he was drunk, I could agree with him that it was like Kool-Aid.  Im sure I need to only drink a bit more alcohol in my life, before I can hate it enough never to drink again. I agree with Claude Brown, you need to know what your missing to truly abstain from it.  Its like that with pork now, I tasted it twice on this trip and I hate the taste.  Its so overly greasy and nasty.  I doubt Ill ever be able to do that with other meats because I cant convince myself that they are slave foods.  Day 6- Scuba!  When I woke up today the first thing on my mind was leaving.  I just wanted to go home, but the day managed to unfold quite well.  I signed up for a morning scuba class, with no guarentee of going on a dive after, but I didn't care.  The lesson was great, and it was taught by this British lady who somehow was able to speak Spanish fluently with a British accent.  The class was great, except my fins were far to big, so my legs got tired out.  This didn't much matter though, because the artifical reef in the diving tank was cool, combined with the interesting sensation of breathing underwater (it was a lot easier then I thought).  Me and dad went to the Beachwalk resturant after, and ate lunch.  I was about to go swimming when a woman from Aqua World ran up to me, and said "Their's Space on a Scuba run, someone just canceled but it's in less then half an hour!"  Me and dad rushed to get our stuff together hurried and got a Cab over to Aqua World,  we made it to the boat just before it left.  The scuba diving trip was unique and probubly my favorite element of the trip.  From the guy showing us the Scuba signal for "Bullshit", and the amazement of seeing all the undersea life and the reefs, I really must admit it was great.  The other three in our group had no problems, and it was so fun.  Sadly when I got out, the boat was rocking and I almost threw up, so I had to sit looking green all the way back.  It was still good.    When we got back to the hotel we debated on what mall to go to, and ended up just going to Kukulkan Plaza Mall to buy some Tequilla for my father.  Then we took the bus back to Aqua World, got our pictures (which mom thought were crap, and oh crap I've just changed the tense) and got back to the Hotel.  At the Hotel we ate at a resturant, our final meal before we left.  Good stuff.     I don't care to mention the journey home.  Boring.  Now your Marcus fans can relax.

      Favorite Dead Prez Songs- 1. Cop Shot 2. Food, Clothes, and Shelter II 3. Mind Sex 4. Hip-Hop 5. Sellin' Dope (Wolves doesn't count)  I woke up to hear "Mind Sex" this morning, and despite the fact most people say it is one of DP's weak points on "Lets Get Free" it's one of my favorite songs from it.  It really has a deep spiritual feeling to it, that although Dead Prez is Atheist, refreshes my soul just to hear.    "It's time for some mind sex, we ain't got to take our clothes off yet We can burn the incense, and just chat Relax, I got the good vibrations Before we make love let's have a good conversation"  The Chorus makes them seem sorta soft, but the song is really good, and the Poem from the LP guy makes me wanna cry because he says it so well, that I gotta listen to it at least twice every night.  "She smiles, I smile She walks, no she glides softly by me changing night into day She opens her mouth to speak, and so sounds ring in my head She speaks, and i want to dance to her rhythm She moves ever so gently, increasing my desires,  As i place my arms around her waist,  Hold and squeeze unto me, I want to melt into her body, and discover the base of her warmth Her beautiful black body that, no human mind could ever conceive She's love She's truth She's real, as real as the stars that shine in the heavens As real as the sun that bathes her body, As real as the moon that glows and the birds that sing and the rose That blossoms in spring for she is that rose And not just any rose, But a black rose, Black rose stands tall and stronger than any other plant A black rose, that stands as creator, of nations of Black rose That never loses her petals, and blossoms all year round Black rose, Sweet rose, Thornless rose Eternal rose Please look my way, Please look my way Please look my way Black rose"  Oh man.  Now this set the tone for my day with all the Negro-ness.  Case in point being history.  I'm extremely torn on the video we are doing.  How are we going to handle it?  Maybe I don't want to touch an issue I've never talked about with non-black people, but it really seems strange.   I don't know what exactly to think about it, because my mind was further broken because as I was talking to the group the words "Jah" came into my mind, even the letters.  The thought was extremely strong, and it really broke my concentration for awhile.  I'm a weird ass.  Then after school I had that damn Spanish video project.  I pray that gets done tommorow.

      Funny stuff today.  On the way to school, we were driving past this old man, and he spits on our car.  Nia was like "Did that white man just spit on our car?" and her friend Nicole was like "Oh yeah, he must looove niggers!" that was pretty funny, but my mom got all Betty Shabazz on them, and was like "Look how your defining yourselves!" but she thought it was pretty funny to.  Had to of been there.  Then yet another black reference, or maybe moment of truth would be a better word.  We are starting to working on our slavery project in History.  I think Cotter did this for two reasons A.) It's not covered well in the book.  B.) There are three black people in the class (inclusive) and I seriously doubt anyone else knows anything about slavery but us (and Cotter), so I assume it's to spread knowledge.  I wanna see how people handle it.  Anyway, I'm pulling away from the point.  I was sitting in our Louis and Clarke group, and suddenly I was like "Shit, this is me.  This is the story of my ancestors and profound jumping the broom and all that jazz."  I guess maybe it's odd because I don't relate this stuff back to people who are related to me most of the time, but this is something I know I had my family knee deep in.... not like anyone cares.  Has anyone noticed how being spontaneous is something that can happen?  I tottally didn't think it true, but I dived into a situation I tottally wasn't ready to face before I had random junk food in my veins.  That was pretty weird, and I felt kinda like an ass, because I'm doing a typical guy thing, which totally ruins my "60% Gay, 40% Fat" persona..... Only a few people actually understand what   I mean but it's really not important.  Then there was that GAIA thing, A-laad, those are some devoted peoples.  I mean these guys go pretty far to protect the local enviornment, feels a helluva a lot more involved then Amnesty is.  Like Amnesty is like "Ayatollah Khomeni, stop killing people please, or we'll send you another nice letter!" but Gaia is like "People dump trash in the river, we're gonna write them up, and harass them, and make them feel stupid!"  Oh well, it was kinda weird how it was mostly underclassmen.  Neema ran the whole meeting, because none of the upper echelon were there.  It was a pretty nice club though, a lot of kids I don't know all that well, yet I know all of them.  Then I got home and logged onto the Esperanto "Babilejo" that was pretty boring since people talk about nothing really interesting.  All I did was greet people, and listened to them argue over grammer, it was rather odd considering I couldn't translate half of what they were saying.  Like some of the stuff people say way to much crap for example- T LuisBr Mi iris al paltalk, shajnas simpatia retejo.    T LuisBr mi nun devas fori&#285;i, horo iri dormi. &#284;is al la amikoj.    Long entry.

      Crap.  I really got sick of studying Arabic.  It's just to difficult, and I'm not going to plan on doing foreign study to much in the Mid-East, I guess.  So for the next few weeks, I'm closing the big red notebook, not looking in the dictionary, and not scribbling Arabic all over my crap.  I'm gonna play it "cool" and do the Esperanto thang.  Even though not one of my loyal reads really cares about me  Atakalam Arabbiyyah Bi-Talaq  Or  Me Parlos Esperanton bone  but oh well.  School.  Nothing to say.  I tried to get all pantheistic and green and go to Gaia, but it wasn't today.  Sucha shame.  I really gotta log of though, as it's late.   Such a short entry.

      Dream, not a particurally strong dream, but I think the dream had to do with something.  When my psyche is in doubt, and my deeper sub-conscious mind speaks one of the choices, I began to wonder if that is what is what my soul finds as right.  I'm hesitant on going with that though, because I'm not sure if it is my soul speaking to me, or just random thoughts, thrown together in a pattern that pleases me.  Poor me. Poor, Poor me.  Today, I went to to the mall with Nia and mom.  I first checked out the game store, got two games I wanna get in the near future.  Then I went to my eye exam, I saw the doctor who knows alicia again.  weird.  Then I went to the book store, and looked up and down the religion section, and using my new random and mutating spiritual mind, I dared to look at the new age section.  Most of the stuff was utter crap, but they throw every non-Christian/Jewish/Muslim/Buddhist book there. I saw some book on Shiva there, and was like "Whoa, that's a disgrace, putting this book with devangari all over it in the New age section" but I let that off my mind and looked at the really interesting book on I-Ching.  I really wanna learn more about that.  Then I passed by this very interesting book title "Is God the Sun?" very interesting thought in a modern context.  Enough about books!  My sister had a pre-liminary confirmation service.  I was like the only confirmed child there, so I kinda walked around in the fellowship hall.  Mr. Harewood saw me, and was nice as usual.  He asked me if I could drive, and I said "No" he started to laugh, and Mr. Gooding started to talk about how he could drive when he was 12 in Jamaica.  It is so nice how those guys treat me with respect, and don't talk down to me.  It really made me feel good.  The service itself was slightly boring until they got up to the foot washing.  The assistant pastor, who is the leader of the confirmation class, washed every confirmee's left foot.  Then each of them washed the right foot of the person to their right.  The significance of the ritual has practical application.  As Joe said "I liked having my feet washed, but didn't like to wash others feet." and the Asst. Pastor said "If it was hard for you, imagine the significance of Jesus humbling himself."  Interesting.   Syracuse won, Lauren came over to watch.  It's gonna be Kansas/Syracuse in the Finals, but sadly Kansas is gonna take all.

      After reading some DJ's and a certain person's oh so depressing blog entries, I felt strange not to answer, if only to myself.  It seems that everyone finds themselves stressed, and caught in the process our parents tell us about.  It's odd, to see it happen, and especially when it happens to your person.  It's a strange phenomena.  Today I told Laura, I should just write in abstract emotions, and she said lust.  Well, I'm not feeling the lusty writting, so instead I'm going to do something extremely easy, and tap into my happiness right now, and try to write down that emotion.  This is going to be very fragmented.  I just deleted what I wrote.  It'll only confuse me in the future.  Right now, I'm feeling pretty nihilistic if anything.  I'm about to play viedo games for a few hours to clear my mind out.

      I found this quote on The-Gnosis-Site, and I really, really like it.  The Death Penalty is nothing less than human sacrifice. It has ritual, religion and it is to appease the God of vengeance. This society accuses the Aztecs of human sacrifice when they practice human sacrifice in virtually every state in the Union.  ~ Russell Means ... June 2, 1997  People always worship gods, almost always unwillingly.  As I told someone "It's easier to just have faith in yourself, it's not to hard." That's where the "light" is anyway.

      Today was run of the mill.  I made it to friday, and Easter is quickly approaching which saddly means I am going to be shipped off to Cancun for Spring Break, dammit.  That'll really suck, I'm starting to hate going on family vactions for weeks on end now.  Even though, I'll have loved wasting my spring break when I return.    Spanish was great today, so somehow it cleared my mind.  We were working on our scrips today, and then Mrs. Lawrence came over, so I started talking about "La Partido de Independencia de Puerto Rico" or something like that.  She thought that was pretty funny, but sort of ignored me until I started talking about  La Brujah  who is a Latina poet.  She knew all about her, and was pretty happy to hear that.  Then we continued to work on trudging through our god-awful long script.  Weird.  Then comes math, where everyone is convinced that I have no social life, which is partly true.  It was pretty funny, because I sped through my homework at Lunch and Mrs. Mastellone was pretty pissed about that and I don't think she gave me credit.  Then she got pissed at me for talking.  That was pretty annoying, but I guess that's pretty normal for me.  And to add to all this Israelis are coming into our history class tommorow.  Second year I get to do this jazz, I should wear some Un-PC shirt, but alas, I have none.

      It turns out I'm my second favorite person, if I were a dictator!  Kill white people and non-bantus!!!           You answer the question: "what if Hitler was black?" A power-mad little shit that will do anything to keep your backside in the presidential seat, that's what! Sadly, no matter how much you persecute your populace, they are getting sick of you! When given the option of starving to death because of the piss poor economy you created or stringing you up by the nearest lamppost, more and more find the later more attractive! Also shave that stupid, little moustache off! It makes you look like an even bigger tit then you are already!   What tin-pot dictator are you?

      It was a good day like every other one, and I really feel like I've moved and done something.  Like I feel like I'm not in the same routine as usual. Something like that happened to me on monday, come to think of it.  I'd walked into school, and was half way to my locker when it actually occured to me, I wasn't thinking, I was just following routine.  No thought entered my mind, until I heard the oh so lovely sound of a black girl screaming at some guy and suddenly snapped back into conciousnes.  It really had me irked the start of first period.  But that was yesterday.  Today, I really actually changed routine.  So I'm glad, it sounds like I'm crazy, because I don't want to go into detail, but needless to say, I'm looking forward to a very happy week.  Oh yeah.  I'm such a strange person.  Naiomba.

      I haven't written this in a while.  If you don't care and try to understand the message, just scroll down.  I'll be writting more then just this entry into  The Dialogue of Thomas with the Savior :   The Great Teacher, spoke to me one day as we were fishing.  "Thomas," said the Savior "Why do you want to worship me?" I looked at the Lord confused, for I had long prayed in his name.  "But Lord, did you not say you were the son of God?" I asked him, quite confused.  The lord then spoke thus unto me, having great annoyance.  "Your ears hear, but your soul does not listen.  First man worshipped statues, but then they found the Father.  Then they found me, and started to call me the Statue, but now I've passes the statue into you."  I sat in silence, staring out across the sea, before I asked the Lord, "Rabbi, what do you mean?  Isn't it said not to worship statues and treat them such as you?".  The lord answered, "But you have no need for idols, you see them as false.  It took me to make you realize that the blood burned in the temple is given to one who is fake.  Now people worship me, but I come to say that you are the one to be worshipped for you have been had the Divine Wisdom (Gnosis) delivered unto you."  I continued to fish, not fully understanding all the words that the Lord had said.  "But Lord, who are you then to me if I am already worthy of praise?"  The Lord moved away from me, but before he left, I heard him say "You have drank from my mouth, and become such as me.  You have no need to worship your equal, for you already have seen God, and God has already seen you.  So who are you praying to?"  With that the Lord was gone, and I sat thinking over these things all the days of my life until I ruled over all I saw.   Okay now that that is done..... I kind of have stayed away from politics recently, although now I've been slipping back into Maoism a bit.  The soft-core type, like the Black Panthers followed, not like Chairman Mao, hard-core pure Maoism.  I don't know why, because I'm a pacifist, but it's hard core stuff.  Next on the order of business.  I really just need to say this in a more open method so it's no longer bottled up.  Why oh why do people throw around the term "anti-semite" so much..... If I was anti-anything I guess I'd be anti-facist, but I do have a strong dislike of Zionism, does that make me an anti-semite?  Apparently......Whatever, everyone instinctively is defensive of their own race.  So I guess it's understandable.  Wow, already feel better, don't have to have this rant evolve.

      I'm really starting to wonder about myself.  I saw a survey about Evolution it asked where does evolution comes from or something like that.  I've never been a creationist, so that option was out but then it asked if God had created/is guiding evolution or if Religion has nothing to do with it.  I've been in my Pantheistic mindset (which to all non-atheist makes me an atheist), so I really didn't know what to put, and I actually felt under a bit of stress.  Oh well.    Carry on then.

      Long time no post.  Just got back from Maryland early, it's a shame because I could have gone to the Memorial Day Parade for Marching band.... oh well.  Not that it really matters, I hate band.  Yeah so whatever.  The trip.  Got there Friday night just slept.  Then Saturday was Mall day.  Went to Tysons Corner supposedly the 8th biggest mall in the United States.  It's in North VA.  We stayed till about four, went to this Sea food place that I haven't been to in years.  Food was good as always, but I ate to much.  I had a bowl of Chowder, and then a sample of fried flounder, fried cod, and fried shrimp.  After that I felt like I was gonna die, and sink into Hell.  So we went back to the Hotel, then dad took us out to the crowded Mall in Baltimore to get Ice Cream.  Needless to say it was ungodly crowded.  Anyway we got our Ice Cream, and we got to see some weird Austrialian preformer preforming in the preforming space.  Sure he was talented but the drunk black kids made it good!  It was funny seeing some of the people around them edge away, and then leave.  Next day, which is technically today.  We checked out.  Drove to my Aunt Vivians, who I'd never met before, and got the added bonus of meeting my Uncle Carlos, and his family.  Also got to play the new Matrix game there.  I want to pick that up tommorow, it has footage of Jada that wasn't in the Movie, and everyone looooves Jada.  Anyway, we left and drove down to DC which was like 10 minutes away, to check out Howard.  It was in the middle of the real Chocalate City that they don't want to show tourist.  Damn, the area around the college looked worse then any part of Newark I've ever seen.  But Howard is still cool, and I want to really go there.    That's pretty much the extent of my trip.  It was a short one, but good.

      I've blown away my entire evening reaping the fruits of fixing this computer slightly.  Ever since this system seemed to go blank on itself, I've been trying to recover all this important stuff.  So it ends up, I managed to finally figure out why the Codecs for half my video files weren't working, and managed to reinstall them (I forgot windows was reinstalled, so it had a new directory).  Anyway, this let me watch "Friday" which I'd spent the last few days trying to download.  It's a pretty good movie, nice waste of time for me.  While it's still fresh in my mind, I kind of have really began to understand Corey Booker from a larger perspective. I can understand his critics more now, and I've come to identify him strongly with black public figures like Tony Brown, and Johnathan Fareley.  The thing I find most interesting about the later two is that they are symbols of the black upper-class (don't wanna use the commie word for it), having grown up their entire life in privelege.  What's most unique to them though, is they always seemed to know they were black and "work with it".  While people like Amiri Baraka, for example, would go "Oh damn! I'm black!".  This would seem to give them a good outlook, but their viewpoint is slightly off kilter.  They have had reinforcement from their parents, but it would seem the social element of "race" is gone.  It seems to show in Bookers politics, but it also seems to isolate him from the rest of the black community that he's trying to defend.  It's quite ironic, because to be in his posistion is to lose quite a bit for progress.  In an ideal society he'd be the symbol of success, but the reality is this guy is a member of the black upper class, and unlike the Early 20th century where people like DuBois would be the leaders, people now wants leaders they can relate to.  It would seem a prophets are bad with timing.  I'm going to count sheep now.

      Semi-Decent weekend all things considered.  Friday was same-ol-same-ol, I was sitting around and Thomas called and says "Hey, can I come over?" So he comes over and stayed until 9.  Ofcourse guys hanging out really doesn't mean anything considering we talked about "empty" topic (alot like empty calories).  Saturday was better, my Father ordered tickets online for the Matrix, and we drove Idris and Co. to the Theatre.  We came the show before the actual rush, so we managed to get in no problem and get good seats.  I was pretty jittery during the movie, like my neck wouldn't stay still, and even the slightest noise would make me visibly tense up.  I guess maybe because I was cold (I don't remember being anxious about the movie).  For anyone who hasn't seen Matrix Reloaded, it's good, but also keep in mind good is a broad definition.  The plot?  What plot? It's to confusing to understand watching it once, and is probubly one of those movies you need to watch in the whole triology to actually feel it properly.  Also if you haven't seen it yet, wait until after the credits to see the trailor for the last movie in the triology.  It looks like it has even more special effects, and will be all about insane amounts of violence and all that poo-lah.   Today, we had to go to Church early because Nia was dancing in the girls dance troupe (actually it's THE dance troupe, but it doesn't really matter does it?).  They were really good at dancing, and the music was one of the best contemporary Christian pieces I've heard in ages.  The service following the dance I didn't like.  We had some overly "urban" guest minister who did the sterotypical baptist movements, and yelling and all of that stuff that would bother a little Methodist boy like me (considering most Methodist minister aren't known for screaming to the point where they need to gasp for air).  He didn't even really say anything, he based his sermon off a Letter of Paul (which he probubly didn't even write) and it was about having joy. Then he starts complaining about other churches Ushers..... Whatever.  I really need to become a more secular christian.  Of course staying to see the dancing again, in the later service I realized why I don't plan on it.  So many hot girls, like the type that you can't look at to long without twitching.  Haha.  That's a real hopeless romantic quote.  Now here I am waiting for around 7 to go to a Synagogue to hear Corey Booker talk about what he always does, because I love him so.

      What I can't stand, is the "old" generation of black people.  Those war-era kids.  I mean, I used to think my grandmothers both had some serious perspective, but it's old perspective.  I can't stand it. I got one Grandmother talking about how she hates guys with "that messy stuff on their heads" I guess that means she hates guys have any other hair style besides short hair.  I mean she probubly couldn't even stand Afro's, but here is a woman who straightens her hair...... I mean, damn at least they aren't doing what guys used to do and straightening their hair.  That's a serious throwback attitude....  Then I got the other grandmother, who I'd assume was worldly, but is almost as bad.  She didn't think we should eat at Mazar because they were Afghani's (and to a lesser extent probubly Muslims) so they might put SARS in our food(?)! What type of BS is that?  Thats a serious problem, it pisses me off to no end.  Then you got all the "old" black people with their crazy form of Christianity, that can't except anything new.  I don't see how they got over complaining about TV's and Movies to even have time to complain about Rap music (but Rap music is what parents are meant to complain about I guess).  That's why I can at least understand Muslim guys, at least they change more with the time.  Majority of the really religious rappers are Muslims, because their down to earth on stuff.  Not up into "I'm gonna go read Sura Wahid to Ashra."  Whatever.  I'm just on a rant.  Speaking of that, I really gotta go to Howard (or GWU) or some school in DC.  I so wanna get in on that DC scene.

      Got pictures I took afterschool today.  I'm so happy about that, considering now I actually have quite a few friends captured on paper.  That's pretty cool.  School sucked, considering I forgot to go to Novemsky to get make-up work, and I have to take a quiz for Mastellone that I haven't even studied for during study (which is when I usually study for math).  School sucks the most at the end of the year, because the sense of time completely slows down or speeds up to such a degree that I don't realize what's going on.  I really don't expect people to understand this, but it was the poem that I had in my mind today from the "Last Poets".   Niggers Are Scared of Revolution  Niggers are scared of revolution But niggers shouldn't be scared of revolution Because revolution is nothing but change And all niggers do is change  Niggers come in from work and change into pimping clothes and hit the streets to make some quick change  Niggers change their hair from black to red to blond and hope like hell their looks will change  Nigger kill other niggers Just because one didn't receive the correct change  Niggers change from men to women, from women to men Niggers change, change, change  You hear niggers say          Things are changing?  Things are changing? Yeah, things are changing Niggers change into 'Black' nigger things Black nigger things that go through all kinds of changes The change in the day that makes them rant and rave          Black Power!  Black Power! And the change that comes over them at night, as they sigh and moan:          White thighs, ooh, white thighs  Niggers always goin' through bullshit change But when it comes for real change, Niggers are scared of revolution    Niggers are actors, niggers are actors Niggers act like they are in a hurry to catch the first act of the 'Great White Hope'  Niggers try to act like Malcolm And when the white man doesn't react  toward them like he did Malcolm Niggers want to act violently  Niggers act so coooool and slick causing white people to say: What makes you niggers act like that? Niggers act like you ain't never seen nobody act before But when it comes to acting out revolution Niggers say: 'I can't dig them actions!' Niggers are scared of revolution   Niggers are very untogether people Niggers talk about getting high and riding around in 'els' Niggers should get high and ride to hell Niggers talk about pimping          Pimping that, pimping what          Pimping yours, pimping mine          Just to be pimping, is a helluva line  Niggers are very untogether people Niggers talk about the mind Talk about: My mind is stronger than yours "I got that bitch's mind uptight!" Niggers don't know a damn thing about the mind Or they'd be right Niggers are scared of revolution   Niggers fuck.  Niggers fuck, fuck, fuck Niggers love the word fuck They think it's so fuckin' cute They fuck you around The first thing they say when they're mad: 'Fuck it' You play a little too much with them They say 'Fuck you' When it's time to TCB, Niggers are somewhere fucking Try to be nice to them, they fuck over you  Niggers don't realize while they doin' all this fucking They're getting fucked around And when they do realize it's too late So niggers just get fucked up  Niggers talk about fucking Fuckin' that, fuckin' this, fuckin' yours, fuckin' my sis Not knowing what they're fucking for They ain't fucking for love and appreciation Just fucking to be fucking.  Niggers fuck white thighs, black thighs, yellow thighs, brown thighs Niggers fuck ankles when they run out of thighs          Niggers fuck Sally, Linda, and Sue          And if you don't watch out          Niggers will fuck you! Niggers would fuck 'Fuck' if it could be fucked But when it comes to fucking for revolutionary causes Niggers say 'Fuck revolution!' Niggers are scared of revolution   Niggers are players, niggers are players, are players Niggers play football, baseball and basketball while the white man cuttin' off their balls  When the nigger's play ain't tight enough to play with some black thighs, Niggers play with white thighs to see if they still have some play left And when there ain't no white thighs to play with Niggers play with themselves  Niggers tell you they're ready to be liberated But when you say 'Let's go take our liberation' Niggers reply: 'I was just playin' Niggers are playing with revolution and losing Niggers are scared of revolution   Niggers do a lot of shootin' Niggers do a lot of shootin'  Niggers shoot off at the mouth Niggers shoot pool, niggers shoot craps Niggers cut around the corner and shoot down the street Niggers shoot sharp glances at white women Niggers shoot dope into their arm  Niggers shoot guns and rifles on New Year's Eve A new year that is coming in The white police will do more shooting at them Where are niggers when the revolution needs some shots!? Yeah, you know.  Niggers are somewhere shootin' the shit Niggers are scared of revolution   Niggers are lovers, niggers are lovers are lovers Niggers love to see Clark Gable make love to Marilyn Monroe Niggers love to see Tarzan fuck all the natives Niggers love to hear the Lone Ranger yell "Heigh Ho Silver!"  Niggers love commercials, niggers love commercials Oh how niggers love commercials: "You can take niggers out of the country, but  you can't take the country out of niggers"  Niggers are lovers, are lovers, are lovers Niggers loved to hear Malcolm rap But they didn't love Malcolm Niggers love everything but themselves  But I'm a lover too, yes I'm a lover too I love niggers, I love niggers, I love niggers  Because niggers are me And I should only love that which is me I love to see niggers go through changes Love to see niggers act Love to see niggers make them plays and shoot the shit  But there is one thing about niggers I do not love Niggers are scared of revolution.   It really is a pretty heavy poem.  My mom was suprised I listened to the Poets considering it was big when she was in High School.... Oh well, I'm a throwback to the 70's.

      Perhaps it's stuff like this from the Dead Prez forums-  From 4tune: Re: Wifey Material??? (No pics, just questions)  Posted: May 12, 2003 6:12 PM   Reply     He is a fuckin' fool. I think he is trying to force the image of white women on us. Nothin new. His ancestors have been doing it for a while now. Let him have his fun. The whole wide universe knows that African women are waaay more superior than white women. Strength, looks, lips, hips, tone of voice, warmth..... Please, I can go on and on.    White women??? Nah. Thats okay. I'll pass     This was in response to some troll coming in and posting naked pictures.  I didn't see them, but according to him these were pictures of white women.  Now, I'm not thinking the overly racially pumped philosophy behind this, but the deeper spiritual part of it reminded me of myself.  I think Sabrina and Rebecca were bothering me (all in good fun) after school, the halls were pretty empty, and this group of black people walked by and looked at me.  I tried to avoid their gaze, but I felt like the biggest sell-out ever with the look they gave me.  Ever since then, I've been hesistant to even be talking to any white girls at all in the halls because I feel like a million eyes are on me, and I guess they sort of are.   Damn.  I really shouldn't be posting something like that.

      How is it I suddenly get so conscious of everything?  Doesn't really matter.    I got picture crazy today, and managed to blow a whole roll of film in maybe 4 minutes.  Then I dropped it off at Rite-Aid to get developed.  Yesterday, I was talking to Aunt Susan about how I'm going to Howard to save me from myself.  She laughed at that, and said I'll end up marrying a white woman right after I leave college then.  Funny stuff.

      So I'm at the link on this page that says "Wisdom".  I was reading something about subpersonalities, and being bored, I tried to find my subpersonality of humor.  I got far more then I bargained for, and wrote it all down in my offline journal before I could forget.  Needless to say it was a rather interesting experience having something that takes shape in your mind "speak for itself".  I probubly sound insane, but it needs to be experienced before one can actually understand.  School, boring.  SOMS School in Action night?  Fun.  I saw how four of Mrs. Winklers kids did Malcolm X in the same style as I did originally!  Yay! I'm an inspiration.  Then I talked to Mrs. Miller and Mrs. Wiggins, that was equally fun.  In general it made my day fun.  I started up again with Arabic, everyone says Esperanto is pretty useless, so I'll stop being idealogical and be practical.  Although I still have two more chapters until I can read a part of "Sinbad the Sailor" in Arabic.  That's like one of the best characters in "1001 Arabian Nights", anyone who hasn't read that book should.  It's the best non-religious Arabic book (I'm not familiar with comtemporary Arabic writting) that one can hope to find.

      High Rate Of Incarceration Is A Challenge To Us All By Cynthia Tucker,  April 28, 2003   With little protest from its crime-weary citizens, the United States has become the prison camp of the Western world, locking up 2 million of its population.   Young black men are a disproportionate number of the inmates. Among men between 20 and 34, 1.4 percent of white men and 4 percent of Hispanic men are behind bars. But 12 percent of black men in that same age group are incarcerated, according to the Justice Department.    That is a stunning statistic. No community can survive the effective loss of so many of its young men.    And the 12 percent figure manages to minimize the crisis, since it is a snapshot of the prison population over any given day. According to Allen Beck, chief demographer for the Bureau of Justice Statistics, nearly 30 percent of black men will be incarcerated during their lives.    Yet you hear little outcry from civil rights advocates. Al Sharpton has campaigned against slavery in Sudan. Jesse Jackson battles gender segregation at Augusta National. Georgia civil rights activist Tyrone Brooks protests the possible return of the Confederate battle flag to the state Capitol.    But the high rate of incarceration -- which is decimating the black working class -- is not the central focus of civil rights advocates. How could that be? It is the single most daunting challenge to black America today because it creates the conditions that lead to other failures.    Already, nearly 70 percent of black children are born outside the bonds of marriage -- leaving those children more vulnerable to educational failure, drug abuse and early parenthood themselves. A community is in trouble when children born to two-parent families represent a minority.    But with so many men of marriageable age behind bars, there is little hope for rebuilding the black family structure. Even when released from prison, those men will make poor prospects for marriage. With criminal histories, they will not easily find good jobs. Moreover, hard time in prison often turns a bad criminal into a worse one -- a man who will be disinclined to rejoin society on any but the most destructive terms.    Clearly, there are among black prisoners many violent felons who deserve their sentences. They are men who rob, murder, rape and maim, making war zones of their neighborhoods. The presence of violent predators not only endangers the lives of law-abiding citizens, but it also ruins economic prospects. Down-at-the-heels neighborhoods have a chance at rebirth only when their streets are safe.    But America's criminal justice system does a poor job of separating the hardened criminal from the minor offender with a shot at rehabilitation -- especially if the offenders are black. Research shows that black men are more likely to be imprisoned for minor offenses, while white men are more likely to be given probation for the same crimes.    This impulse to imprison black men now stretches to include the man-child. Frightened by a few highly publicized juvenile crimes, politicians began imposing harsher sanctions on juvenile offenders in the early 1990s. Predictably, the lash has fallen more frequently on black and brown boys than white.    Among young people who have never been to a juvenile prison, blacks are more than six times as likely as whites to be sentenced by juvenile courts to prison time, according to a 2000 report, "And Justice for Some," issued by the Justice Department and several foundations. For those charged with drug offenses, black youths are 48 times more likely than whites to be sentenced to juvenile prisons, the report said.    It is now possible to visit black neighborhoods where most of the young men have disappeared, where families spend their Sundays visiting their incarcerated loved ones, where boys believe going to prison is a rite of manhood. Those neighborhoods cannot hope to offer their residents a route into the American mainstream.    The epidemic of incarceration ought to be the full-time preoccupation of every civil rights group -- indeed, every human rights group -- in the country. It represents a grave threat to the future not only of black America but to all of America.  from-  urlLink http://www.guerrillafunk.com

      My father will drive me insane.  He comes up with crap at the worst moments.  Like he comes in today, when I felt like my soul was lacking any life, and says "Oh, clean the litter box, and we're going to your grandmothers in half an hour."  That was an hour ago.  I dropped what I was doing, made my grandmother a birthday card and put off just calling her.  Then I made another card.  All por nada so far and it's only getting later.  He's so dumb at times....   Torpey has a pretty cool website on the bright side.  It's so business like.  Then Kirills Xanga... man... they must teach those guys some heavy computer stuff in Russia, because his Xanga is the most together one I've yet to see.

      "Afrikan Sunrise", I guess that has a lot of meaing, but it just fits after paging through J. Henrick Clarke again.  After school (and Gaia), I walked out towards Rite-Aid, when my Aunt drove by and picked me up.  She asked if I wanted to go to Kings and I was like "What the Hell".  So I asked her why she doesn't go to PathMark and she says because she needs a rest after work.  So, we go to Kings get her stuff, and she starts arguing with the Cashier.  That was slightly funny, but she was annoyed because she didn't want to be treated "black" by a black woman. Oh well.  Got my camp pictures.  No pictures of any girls!  Dammit! Oh well.....   So today I noticed something, and am like "Well this is the end of that...." That's cool though.  I can deal with that the problem is previous obligations.... I can deal though.  I'm a happy person.  Why the hell does this crap always happen in the Spring?

      People are crazy.   I ate some crap, read, watched Tv, ate dinner, read, watched Boston Public, Finished reading, and now here I am.  Still here.  Nothing has changed except it's gotten later, and what's bothering me still wants to stay.  The best part, is their is no answer I can really get from anyone else that'll make me happy.  It's one of those situations where everything is entirely in my control like I always want it, and now that I have that, I hate it.  Damn.    I posted on an Occult forum for fun.  I seriously need to learn how to do that Out of Body stuff, that'd probubly make me crazy enough to be happy.  Even though it's all probubly just a bunch of BS.   I get involved in to much crazy stuff.  Kwa Nini Mungu?

      Dreamless night.  I guess in the long run that was good.  I seriously need to have my heart broken though, using my Platonic Allegory (I learned that word in English today!) I'll explain, I have this storm cloud hanging over my head and it's been here for months, but it hasn't rained.  It's only sitting there, and I hate it because I want to be rained on so the cloud can go away and I can finally see the sun again.  On the bright side Thomas gave me this RBG button with something about Anti-War and Reperations.  That's pretty funny.  Listening to "Thinking about Home" By The Delinquents.  So touching.  I really need to find a hobby that actually can keep my attention because my mind is just wandering around to much. I'm dabbling in all types of crap most people don't have time to bother with.

      Before I went tottally crazy I watched "Empire" With Leguizomo. Good movie.  Although I still felt strange, so after dinner, I started delving deep into the Occult and I'm probubly gonna mingle with that Magic crap until I realize it's all a joke.  It's slightly disturbing how many people play around with that type of stuff though..... Whatever that's just my confusion speaking out.

      I've been having recurring dreams.  The same general thing for the past three or four nights, with maybe something a little different.  Never having had a recurring dream (not nightmare) it has kind of disturbed me.  Last Nights dream was the strangest, since the person in it actually ended up seeming more like Devon/Rene(Two cousins) then who they were supposed to be.  I'm assuming I had this dream, which I don't want to elaborate on, because I went to sleep around 9 on a Saturday which is extremely early for me, and didn't get up until 9 today.  It was pretty weird, I've been pretty anti-Christian for the past few days and today I really just didn't want to be dragged to church.  Fortunately I wasn't, so instead I could waste my day at home.  Great trade off.   I've been really feeling strange for the last three days, and I have no clue why.  Probubly those dreams have something to do with it, but they are usually a reflection of something I'm already thinking of or that is weighing down on my mind.  But why now and not months ago?

      Why does my father drag me around everywhere?  He seems to not understand that since I don't complain, it doesn't mean I want to do stuff with him.  He's pretty silly though, so what can I expect?  River Cleanup today.  It was pretty good, especially since I met a girl who knows my cousin pretty well.  That's always cool.  I walked home from it, happy after I left but then sad realizing that was all I was doing that day.  I'm definitely not going to the night of stars, that's just a bad idea.  Whatever.... So I'm gonna sit and regret not doing anything this weekend when I could have.  I really do not want to go to Church tommorow, I'm getting pretty bored with that since we really don't learn anything overly important.  I get to hear how Pastor doesn't like Bush and how to be good to your wife in the actual service, then the good stuff really starts! Mr. Harewood talks about how Paul was friends with Timothy.  Wow, that'll help me get into heaven.   In the days that others would call Pentacost, I lived apart from many of the others, offering where I could, and taking as little as possible.  It was after doing this for sometime, that the Savior returned from the Heaven of the Tenth to speak to me.  "Why do you stay silent?" The Lord said unto me, for I had not spoken for sometime out of regret.  "Lord, you shed your blood for all of our sins, but why is it me and the Others who recieved your Soul after death?"  The Lord answered, "Why do you look to my death as granting you a gift?  If I was to die, I would have already been dead when I was born, so must have already been resurrected and have gained eternal life before the crucifixition.  For the Crucifixion wasn't murder, rather it was my soul feeding the Tree of Knowledge that grows in the center of paradise.  Rather it was me allowing the Tree of Knowledge to bloom again, so all may taste the fruit like I had."  I sat, and thought of these things for two and one more hour before I responded "But Lord, was it not the price you paid that allowed man to taste your Soul in Death, but for me and the Others to taste your spirit during life?"  The Lord grew angry hearing this, "Ye of little Knowledge! Surely trees do not grow all their fruit in an instant and drop it all of at once for the animals to eat.  The twelve have all tasted only the ripest fruit that still remains on the Tree of Knowledge.  Joyus will the day be when all the fruit can be fresh enough for all of man to enjoy as you have!"  The Lord left and did not return after this.  Some time after an Angel of the blind one whom some call Sameal came down, trying to sow the seeds of faith in the blind one in me but Sameal had not tasted of the Tree of Knowledge.

      River Cleanup in like 10 hours.  Instead of sleeping I dug up a Baha'i prayer (since the Gnostic ones are way to scary, and the only "Christian" ones are Catholic, and well... they aren't my style.) for tommorows great day of work  O Thou Whose tests are a healing medicine to such as are nigh unto Thee, Whose sword is the ardent desire of all them that love Thee, Whose dart is the dearest wish of those hearts that yearn after Thee, Whose decree is the sole hope of them that have recognized Thy truth!  I implore Thee, by Thy divine sweetness and by the splendors of the glory of Thy face, to send down upon us from Thy retreats on high that which will enable us to draw nigh unto Thee.  Set, then, our feet firm, O my God, in Thy Cause, and enlighten our hearts with the effulgence of Thy knowledge, and illumine our breasts with the brightness of Thy names.    -Baha'u'llah

      I have stuff I want to do, but I'm bored.  I had another entry of my continuing Dialogue, but I'm to lazy to do heavy writting or thinking.  I guess I'm just tired, but I don't want to fall asleep.  It's a weird kind of boredom, that knows what it wants to do, but doesn't because some deeper emotion that I'm pushing away is finally getting in the way.  Worked on our projected today.  Weird stuff.  Lot of people at Gaia to.  Weird stuff.

      Wow, I had a purely Gnostic moment today.  I think it had something to do with pregnancy, which is a pretty foreign concept to a little nino like me, but I had a complete mental shift from that for a second.  Pretty strange.  Speaking of a Gnostic moment, it all became clear.  The story I was writting, I could continue it in a second story with the most obvious thing? The Illumanati!  I'd better starting writting it soon before I hate the idea, considering my bi-polar nation.  Even better, tommorow I got like 50 bucks headed my way.  Life is good.

      Okay,  so the orientation was today.  It was pretty fun.  I, being the lunatic I am, volunteered for the pre-school along with a college girl and a college bound Columbia girl.  Suprisingly my mother was impressed I volunteered for doing pre-school daycare, because it's not much of a "guy" thing.  I don't know how to take that in the actual dealings of things.  It all starts Monday, and I'll find out if I actually made a wise choice.

      Okay, New blog setup up great.    Now that the Preamble is out of the way: "Without a people's army the people have nothing.  "On Coalition Government" (April 24, 1945), Selected Works,  Vol. III, pp. 296-97"  This can explain why I'm so nervous now.  I don't have an army.  Or it could be my job orientation is tonight, and I really hope I don't freak out and I'm at a camp with people I know.  I'm pretty sure Lauren is working their, and if we're lucky we can be at the same site so I have a guarenteed ride todos los dias.    I just played Freedom Force for about 4 hours.  Don't you love how I randomly switch topics? This was ofcourse after I read a short Chapter in Count Zero, one of the most hard to follow books ever.  So many characters.....  Signing off. I'll say how the orientation went later.

      Okay, I was considering having this entry reveal what my Blogs title means.  But I'm not going to.  So anyway, it's summer and I'm bored as Hell.  Fortunately I got an orientation meeting for camp tommorow (or was it Thursday?), and I can finally get towards working with ninos!   My Uncle left today.  So yesterday we went to Ruby Tuesday's.  He's been obsessed with that place, since they don't have them in California.  He's been eating these spicy ribs there like non-stop.  Crazy stuff. So were eating, talking about games and movies and all that good stuff.  He says after he picks up this demo tape from this guy he wanted to come over and play the Matrix game.  Okay, that's cool with me.  I was tired as sin, but it was still cool.   So he comes over and is like "Do y'all have any peptobismol, my stomach is really feeling bad... Probubly from eating those spicy ribs for five days" Okay, laugh.  It was pretty funny.  He threw up like ten times though, and it sounds pretty distressing to hear a grown man throwing up. Anyway, he stayed over until midnight-ish.  Before he left he was like I got a studio recording at like 10AM tommorow, wanna come? So ofcourse I said Okay, what time do I need to be up.  He goes "Nine" and I was like whoa... Damn... sorry no. I'm not gonna be awake that early.  Today I woke up at 11.  Proof I know myself. I tried to play the computer but I was so bored most of the day.  Considering it's 7PM now, I guess I survived, and I'm going to have a job to worry about next week.  So it's all good.

      So did I finish the school year? I think I did.  It's all over, Insha Allah.  I'm good, and I really don't think the gravity of it has hit me yet.  I'm thinking way too long range, I've already got Junior year planned out. This summer is gonna suck, that's why.  I can feel it. Sure I get to see the cousins and all, but that's not gonna float me forever.  I'll come up with something to do.  Maybe listen to myself, and stop hiding behind all those jokes.  Wow, that was pure Gnostic moment.  Anyway.  Black Nationalism. Afro-Centrism.  Black Radical.  All that is the Deadprez board.  It is so seriously bad for my health to fill my mind with that type of crap over the summer.  I mean, I turned a socialist last summer from reading too much weird stuff.  Okay, I've fallen off topic.  I'd make an entry into my Gospel, but considering no one understands it, and I'm lazy right now I don't feel like writting another entry.

I'm glad for my sake that I didn't post. Then we have those nuts who go to raisethefist.... Oh Allah, I was only further pissed from that.  So I'm currently needing to stay away from most things that involve race, or else I will simply explode from the anger.    Who knew the internet could cause such anger?

Zend-Avetas Scary stuff.  Judaism and Christianity stole half their crap from these dudes.  Crazy.  Random Political thought- How is Democracy not Tyranny of the majority in it's ideal form?

      One final outta the way.  So that leaves me like 5 Finals.... Maybe even less then that since I don't really give a damn about the band final because I already got a 78 on it without taking the final.  Whatever, I got another year of being passive under my belt, even though I have that loud aura.  I guess everyone has some social handicap.    I'm going to listen to loud reggea and pretend to be West Indian to feel better.  Because I'm a real raggamuffin fi real fi real. Gotta study for physics though.

      I've come to terms with the general topic of religion.  Atheism really never was the way of thinking that I could ever work with, because it's even more exculsive then Christianity.  Atheist think they've found the truth with their weird mind games, when really it's just a mindset settling for less.  Science can always explain how things happen, that's not the problem but atheist seem to think "how" is the only thing that's important.  The "Why" of a situation is of equal important, unfortunately that's always harder to explain.  Atheism seems to graze over it, that's the problem.  Christianity ask why, Judaism ask why, Islam ask why, Hinduism ask why, Buddhism ask why.... I mean, they may have problems along the way, but they still try to ask why.    Whatever.  I think something talked to me yesterday.  I was lying down, trying to tune the outside world out, and focus inward.  That's not the easiest thing, because the slightest noise would drag my attention away.  But finally I managed to zone out, into pretty abstract thoughts, then suddenly either it was a thought or a voice seemed to speak clearly into my ears.  It said something like "Now how do we divide your brain" I wrote it in my theories journal, but I had already forgotten it, when I broke off the meditating.  It was a seriously strange experience, not because it hasn't happened before, because it has happened in the past.  It was strange, because I was doing something abstract hoping to only get mundane results, and got something crazy.  But then again, yo estoy muy tonto.... Pero sabes esta!

      Listening to "Dem Crazy" by Dead Prez.  It's always good to open up with the song I'm listening to, for some reason It's sort of like saying "well...ummm" before I start speaking.     Anyway.  End of school.  Here. Now.  Having got a call from Mr. Brady.... probubly means I didn't get the job.  Unless I should wait for tommorow.... who knows.  The job isn't the most important thing to me, I'm pretty sure I'll fare well without it.  But finals, I hate studying, and I'm going to need to study this year for mucho clases porque Senora Pollack crea que giving muchos finals will actually accomplish something.  Why the hell does she have to get so involved in stuff?  I remember  Neutral Nation, talked about a boss has less productive workers if it (he/she) doesn't get involved with it's workers.  I'm starting to see why he said this.  I'm really uptight though.  I gotta start doing some of that heavy meditation stuff.  See if I can enter into a mental cocoon.  Maybe come to terms with how my mind is set up.  Yeah, I'm the Moderate Christian turned ultraliberal christian (even though I can't even conform to the Apostle's Creed to well.)

      I basically have two stories that I'm currently writting.  The first one  Something was Not Right  I was really into writting for awhile, but then the idea fell apart.  It was pretty hard to think of stuff for a kid with ESP to actually do.  So I put that idea on hold and started to write  The Day before Armageddeon  Really bad idea, if only because I can't invent an entire danm setting for all my characters and since this story is supposed to take place over 200 years in the future it had it's problems.  So now I've got a third idea that I really like with a mix of things from Neuromancer, and numerous other sources.  I considered making a "not to distant" future setting with people dying in the Matrix, and having their souls linger, but then I thought of something cooler.  Using my interest in the Occult could give this story a unique edge.   My general overview for the story would be a small business figures out a scientific procedure that reduces astral projection down to a science.  This makes it possible for nearly anyone to project themselves, but at the same time opens them up to long explorations of the Astral world, which isn't what it seems when the realize they are only touching the surface, which is full of only emotions. Long and short of it, is they discover that "below" this world of emotions lies land of the dead of sorts.  It's a general Pandoras Box theme, I guess maybe a little bit of horror.  It has some potential, but I really need to flesh out this "astral world" idea.  So, that's proof of my artistic little heart at work.

      If you haven't already download "Tabula Rasa II" by Freundeskreis.  It's the sickest song ever! I wanna go to Germany after hearing it.... Damn, Europe's got some great Music. Never thought I'd ever say that.  Zapitista Nationalista, that's me.   Libre para Todos, Nada para Nosotros.   I went to Park West for dinner.  Finished my project earlier after working on it for two and a half hours today, I really don't like artistic projects.  The Spanish department is a bunch of  putas .  That's about as much spanish as anyone gets to hear me speak.

      This is from  Thunder:Perfect Mind  in the Nag Hammadi-   Why, you who hate me, do you love me,  and hate those who love me?  You who deny me, confess me,  and you who confess me, deny me.  You who tell the truth about me, lie about me,  and you who have lied about me, tell the truth about me.  You who know me, be ignorant of me,  and those who have not known me, let them know me.   For I am knowledge and ignorance.  I am shame and boldness.  I am shameless; I am ashamed.  I am strength and I am fear.  I am war and peace.  Give heed to me.  I am the one who is disgraced and the great one

      Depression really is sinking in over this Spanish project.  I wanted to make a collage and after two hours of cutting out pictures I realized my idea didn't come together in a way I wanted.  So when I went to Anita's party it was on my mind the entire damn time.  I couldn't think straight and was pretty on the edge because of that I guess.  I guess that and the sugar is what made me so jittery to the point where people jokingly asked if I was high.....  Whatever.  More funny stuff.  Kim seems to have some sudden dire hatred of me.  That's perfectly fine, but she seems to be more blunt towards me suddenly.  I guess not talking to a person really can get them pissed at you months later.

      How is it that when I'm depressed I take up the Ultra-Lefitst black-reactionary stance to everything? I actually was reading MalcolmX speaks, and was tempted to listen to him.  Then I went to Raisethefist, and feel like I'm falling back into anarchy again.  Whatever... I'm just strange.

      I hate sports, I'm to into them for my own good.  I felt physically sick when the Nets started to lose their lead, and knew I couldn't sleep unless I either saw them win or stopped watching the game. Well, being the wuss I am, I saw them blow a 5 point lead and go 8 in debt..... So I decided I'll just watch hockey tommorow.  I can deal with the Devils losing.  They've already had a cup.    Anyway.... You can go back to your little reality now.

      Conner is seriously going to be the death of me.  I have never really had so much bottled up rage towards anyone, maybe it's my desire for independent thinking in all my kids doesn't get through to this guy.  Maybe it's because he doesn't talk about "intelligent" things.  I have Jacob talking to me about TV shows, and his friends.  Then I got Eli talking about his Parents......... I better stop with all this detail.  The thing is, I need a way to deal with this.  So today, I was on the Gnostic sub-forum of the Occult forum and it made me think.  As much as I'd like to use some Thelemic Ritual and upon a Gateway and have him dissappear, I realize that A. I don't have that amount of belief. B. I think it's impossible.  C. Even if it was possible, how many people can actually do that?  So then, the Gnostic thing pops up.  I did this before, I tried to clear my mind and hopefully have my mind deliever me an answer.  Bad idea though!  I swear I heard a voice last time I did that, and I've been pretty scared of doing that since.  Especially because I haven't heard a straight answer, and have been trying to assume it was my psyche talking in some overly Jungian fashion.  So, I may sound like a tottal freak, being a dabbler in the Occult, and actually believing some of this mystic garbage to be real, but I don't know.  I really see a moral problem with turning to the Occult to solve minor problems while others talk about Astral Death, Terrestrial Disturbances and all that good stuff.  So maybe I am insane, maybe it's the fact that I'm tired and stressed because of a brat.  Who knows? Me? "Seek and ye shall find" Maybe I'm afraid to seek? Whatever, I'll sleep and be better in the morning.

      Okay.  Good last few days up until one of the Twins peed on me today.  Saturday my mother hosted the staff-parish relations meeting at our house. So we had a BBQ!! That was amazingly (suprisingly?) fun.  Cousins from Dover, and there kids also came over, they really complain to much, but whatever, this is the first time in a long time that they've been over.  So that day went well, infact once I'm done writting I'm going to get some left over steak.  Yummm......    So yesterday, we got to see the Cousins from Washington, w00t.  They'd come in Saturday, but we gave them that day to settle into NYC.  Lucky them, because the Make-a-Wish Foundation put them up in the Hilton in Times Square!  I can only think of two Hotels that are better and that'd be the Marriot and the Plaza (and the Plaza is to Bougie...).  So we saw them, walked around a bit, and finally settled on this one tiny resturant around 50th Street and 7th Ave.  It was pretty nice eating there, got to catch up with the Cousins.  Then we walked back to the Hotel, passing by Times Square and having my dad point at certain sites.  Like eighteen guys approached Scott trying to sell him stuff.  I liked the guy who walked by him casually and asked if he wanted a bag of Hip-Hop and R&B CD's.  So we got back to the Hotel eventually, and bid them good day until Tuesday (Sarah is going to St. Barnabus for some treatment).  So we walked across the street to the Coldstone Creamery, to see what this place is all about (they're opening one in SO).  It was pretty good stuff, but they treat Ice Cream like an art there, and it's very formal (I guess that'd be a good word).

      From www.guerillafunk.com  Amerikkka Eats It's Young By Paris,  July 7, 2003   A recent report was released which critiqued the performance of students in the Oakland Unified School District. It was alarming, to say the least. If the stats are to be believed, 40% of four-year students who enter the 9th grade in that district dont graduate out of high school. Yes, you read it correctly - 40%! Of those who do graduate, only 7% have enough credits to be admitted to the state university or U.C. systems. The numbers are even worse for African-American students -- only 4% graduate with enough class credit to attend college. Of course, whether or not those who are able can afford to go is another question entirely.   School officials say the number-one problem is lack of reading skills, with many students not reading by the third grade. In case you dont know, students in the Oakland Unified School District are primarily African-American. No doubt, this same poor scenario is being repeated in numerous inner-city school districts nationwide.   These new statistics further confirm a belief that Ive held for some time now -- that we are, quite simply, AT WAR.   Not with another country. Not with foreign terrorists. Not with Muslims, Anthrax or dirty bombs. Not against the SARS epidemic, MonkeyPox, snipers, Mexican child-abductors, gang members, mad cow, african bees, medflys or any other fear inducing topic or group that the U.S. media continuously spooks us about. No, the real war is being waged right here at home by the system against us -- against people of color. Thats why its now more important than ever to reject bullshit thats fed to us daily as truth and stay focused.   Focused on what, you may ask? Focused on each other. Focused on goals, achievement and education. Focused on progression within our own communities. On enlightenment. On the collective good of all of us. On the come up.   We are taught to fear each other, act ignorantly (as if ignorance = ghetto -- it doesnt), be distrusting of all that is black and accept our faulty condition with a smile. So very little is now expected of us as a people that we often fail to aspire to achieve at all. This must change.   When asked what career goals they had, the majority of students questioned in the above-mentioned report said they either want to be rappers or atheletes. Its a sad fact, but its no surprise, really. A good portion of their parents had the same aspirations. Besides, they seem to be the only career choices for us reinforced by the media. But remember that its parents, not teachers or the media, that should play the most important role in children's education. Every black parent ought to insist on academic excellence, and they must combat the perverse view among many black kids that serious scholarship is "a white thing." Remember that millions of people in this country survive and succeed in life in professions outside of music and sports. We all cant rap or play ball -- its not for everybody.   But thats the power of the media and entertainment. White-owned companies dictate our tastes through art and sell an often unobtainable dream to us everyday -- the $400,000 cars, the genocidal diamond-encrusted jewelry, and the lavish multi-million dollar homes -- all supposedly the rewards for bad behavior through music. But what they dont tell us is that it is a lie more often than not. Many of the homes seen on Cribs and How Im Livin are rented by record companies to give the audience the impression that artists are doing better than the really are financially. Cars are leased, and the oh-so-fine sistas we see in the videos parading around half-naked are rented from model agencies. Dont believe the hype. In an industry that supposedly values keepin it real they are the most plastic of all. And sadly, rather than protest and demand more ownership and money for what they create, many artists would rather front and play the role of affluence. Damn.   It is all a part of a very elaborate and well-thought out plan that emphasizes and glorifies our self-destruction. More mature and dangerously-influential artists (in the eyes of white companies) like myself are effectively prevented from reaching the people with messages that would surely enlighten. Instead, these companies opt for the young and dumb, with anything goes imagery that severely affects black youth negatively. Dont be a statistic. How many advertisements for the military do you see while watching BET? While reading The Source? Its no secret that the U.S. military recruits many college-eligible black men -- men that, in this day and age, end up being cannon-fodder for war-mongering rich white folks. And while its true that many black teenage boys start out as bright and disciplined pupils in elementary school, they often begin to drift toward mediocrity -- if not delinquency -- by the time they reach junior high. Nationally, only 34 percent of black male high school graduates go on to college. Add to this the disturbing trend of racist whites and self-hating selfish house niggas like Clarence (Uncle) Thomas and Ward Connerly to repeal affirmative action legislation and the picture gets grim indeed.   So what do we do? Well, we have to get right. The answer really is simple. Each one of us has to take the initiative to positively influence those who need direction. Sometimes parents are ill-equipped to handle the task, so its up to other individuals to set the correct example. Even though college is dismissed as being white or uncool by many in our communities who dont know any better, its no secret that higher education affords more opportunities to those who have it. We must not allow ourselves to be excluded from the game out of the gate because we dont have the proper credentials.

      I had a pretty good day today, until I read some ignorant crap about Affrimative Action, and realized I wanted to keep my blood pressure low.    Preschool is getting easier.  I'm enjoying it.  Now, all I need to do is focus.  And then go see my Spike Lee movie day.   School Daze, Do the Right Thing and Jungle Fever......  That'll be great.  Especially Larry Fishburne (aka Morpheus) in School Daze, man, that guy is a good actor.

      When I often wondered if being gay actually came with advantages, I couldn't think of any and I laughed and said "Haha, Gays only get magical music from behind."  Sadly, I was wrong.  After the second day of my job, I began to realize that straight males can't do everything women can do.  I probubly should have seen Daddy Daycare, before I decided to work the preschool.  It was seriously one of the dumber choices I made.  Firstly, I'm the only male.  Secondly, the second youngest person there is going into her Freshmen year in Highschool.  Another girl into her Sophmore, and the other three girls (I guess that'd be the term) are teachers in there mid-20's.  They can deal with this motherly changing kids clothes type of thing, and talk about colleges.  While I just sort of saunter around pretending I didn't make a bad choice.  Don't get me wrong, doing preschool has it's moments but I really don't have the femine type of skills needed to do it effectively.   But on the bright side, I have seen one advantage of this today.  One of the black kids mothers was observing the daycare to see if her son would like it yesterday and I started to talk to her a bit.  She was really nice, and I could clearly tell she was overjoyed to have a black guy working at the daycare her son would be going to.  Today when she picked up her son, she was introducing me to her husband, and telling me about her son and honestly I felt good.  I hadn't felt that needed all day at it was quite a welcome feeling.  Especially with the aura that seems to surround the other counselors when they're around me.  Sort of a  "What is he doing here?" type of Aura, which doesn't help with my "What am  I  doing here Aura. I don't know, I generally don't enjoy the things I do but I'll learn to cope.  Besides if I ever plan on having kids this can be useful.  But damn, these kids can't even go to the bathroom alone.  Let alone the fact that I can't even talk to them about the most basic things (unless I was talking about there sock colors or something).

      I hate facial hair sooo, sooo much.  I'm not lucky enough actually have a beard, I have like 5 damn hairs on my chin, that I pluck everday, but are fully grown by the next day! It's making me insane! I will seriously die, when I actually have a beard.  On a more serious note.  I've completed two stories this summer.  Now I have "Senses" and "The Dreamer" under my belt.  Lo ironico, that no one has read them yet.  Oh well, I've still accomplished something.

I don't plan on finishing it all before I go to Virginia beach next week, but I at least want to have all the damn essays done.  I'm the master of CP time....  Whatever though.  Stuff'll get done.    Also, has anyone else started to feel old yet?  I can already feel the slight pressure from the years pilling up, and I'm what? Sixteen?

      Besides nearly finishing my outlining for US History (I'll be done with the outlines tommorow) I've been writting quite a bit.  I spent yesterday, doing some much needed editing to my next short story "The Dreamer".  It's going pretty well, and I guess I've discovered something about writting (at least for me) a good story is like a baby, it's generally not all planned for, and grows quickly on it's own.  It has it's own life, it's own mind and it's own soul.  The writters job is to jot down what the story has to say.  A bit of philosophy for y'all there.  But seriously.  The story has hit me with writters block, I don't know whether to wrap up the plot, and just end the story, or if to continue on.  Logically, I could continue it into a second day, but I'm not sure where I want to climax of the story to be, and I do believe I've already hit a good one.  Also, continuing would change the entire mood of the story, from something of personal discovery, and self-control, to something far more cosmic like Responsibility, or some other crazy word they peddle to us in English class.   Not like you, dear reader (which is likely just two people), even care much about this.   So I'll move on.  Michael, Thomas and Idris came over today.  We did our stupid, we're so cool, even without watching TV guyish type of things.  Magically this occupied over five hours, que bueno, no? Then I played Dungeon Keeper until the old fashion graphics with their glaring colors made my eyes start to water.  So I just said "F'it" and logged out, and now I'm about to burn new CD, and probubly play that while I outline.  But who knows, I'm tired still from outlining the Civil War Chapter Yesterday (and I still need to mark down all the major battles).  All this while Cotter flee off to Bongoland to have little kids run up to him and say "Mzee"! and "Mzungu"! and numerous other happy things in Swahili.  I can imagine Cotter with a phrase book now looking for a Teksi "Teksi! Teksi! Hundi za Posta?" But with a distinctive Cotter tone.

      Okay so I'm not going out tonight, and Nia did.  Whatever, I know the real reason I want to go out, and my ideal Friday night is unlikely to happen this summer.  So I went and started my AP history assignment, outlined the first of four chapters, and browsed all the DBQ documents.    I feel slightly better knowing work is over, but somehow something about it, that I can't put my finger on.  Really, really bothers me about it ending.  Like I forgot something?  I don't know....

      I hate this feeling, I often get it.  It's like this empty void in my stomach, that I know I have no way of filling in the near future, and if I get the chance to fill it I won't.  It's the feeling of my teenage years slipping away, and I just watch it happening.  I mean, I'm living "the good life" to outside observers, but to me I know I'm missing out.  I know I'm wasting time.  Maybe this is the feeling of getting old, striking prematurely.  who knows?

      I don't think I can ever read a school book about AIDS and not be permanently stressed.  Everything about the disease worries me, and bothers me even moreso.  I can't get over the fact it seems to have originated in Central Africa in supposedly the 50's, despite the fact it was agreed upon as originating in the 70's for much longer.  Next thing that bothers me, if it originated in Central Africa then why is it so prevelant among African-Americans? By the same logic it should be a huge problem with British blacks, and Brazilian blacks because they come into quite a bit of contact with Native Africans as well.  Then we have the gay community being big on AIDS, that makes ABSOLUTELY no sense at all, why them? Aren't their other tight knight communities that have sex?   So I've come to one of two conclusions.  The first, being the most likely.  We have a disease that came about after the destruction of smallpox, although that is now being denied.  Why is it being denied now? Could it be possible, since most humans on the planet were vaccinated, that a disease could have been planted in the Small Pox Vaccine? That could explain why it's prevelant in not only Central Africa (and with Modernization, such as the multi-national highways, and roadside prostitutes, couldn't a disease becoming wide spread in the Southern become a logical conclusion?) but also with the Gay community.  Many of our parents were given the Small Pox vaccine.  How easy would it have been to slip a disease in that way.  Even more, with the advances in medicine at the time, isn't it easy to imagine AIDS being an intentional mutation of a far older African disease? People suspect it's been around for a long while, but the older cases could be a different (and likely isolated strain) of primative AIDS.  If it was mixed with another disease, wouldn't this change it's genetic material, and as such how it worked?  So many holes in the story.... For example, wouldn't it have spread to China?  Why isn't it devastating India?  It can't be marriage traditions, because cities of millions old ways die quickly.  So what could it be?

      Talib Kweli is a genius.  I've been listening to him and Dialated Peoples alot recently.  The way Dead Prez is acting right now confuses me quite a bit, and I'm assuming it's all that weed that's go to their heads.  Whatever, I ain't tryin' to understand that one.  On a more down to earth note, Nia has arrived home today.  How exciting, we went out and ate Mexican food as a result.  Yum.  Now everything is more or less back to normal.  Nia adjust to being back in the suburbs quite well.

      "Democracy Is Under Attack - Let's Take it Back" Cynthia McKinney,  August 6, 2003   A note from our friend Mike Ruppert: As the credibility of the U.S. government unravels across the board, former Georgia Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney, now completely vindicated in her open questions about the government's account of 9/11, is making her presence felt throughout America. Currently in the midst of a lawsuit that may well see her returned to Congress with full seniority, she has become a living reminder for politicians around the country that there are questions to be answered and that undefeated and dedicated voices with growing strength on the political battlefield are not afraid to demand full accountability.   The truth never disappears.    In a recent speech in Harlem, McKinney offered some sobering and very direct observations about race relations in America, 9/11, civil liberties, independent media, From The Wilderness and our national ad campaign [in which GNN listed - ed.] which is encountering stiff, unethical, and unconstitutional resistance from major publications which seem to be continually resetting the height of the bar we must clear in order to get the ads run. To clarify one point: While papers like the Boston Globe and the Atlanta Journal Constitution have refused to run the ad after checks were written to the brokerage firm and AFTER the papers had approved the it, no check has yet been written for The New York Times. The Times has simply reneged on a prior approval and agreement to run the ad. Each time FTW passes a new test, another one mysteriously appears. The powers that be are afraid of these ads. Yet they have seen nothing compared to the price they will pay when the stench of censorship becomes so blatant and obvious that the people realize that the most precious right of every American has been taken away.   Such censorship is not going unnoticed. The right of free speech and equal access is not one that can be violated without a reaction.  MCR, August 5, 2003   "Democracy Is Under Attack - Let's Take it Back" - Cynthia McKinney, Harlem, USA - July 31, 2003    How proud I am to stand at Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem USA!    Thank you Reverend Butts, Bob, Ruby Dee, Ossie Davis, Sonia Sanchez, Ralph Carter, Hakim, the Coalition of Artists and Activists, and all who worked hard to put this rally together. And thank you for inviting me.    How appropriate that we gather here at this Church, with all its rich history of proud resistance and indignant defiance of a social order that relegated the giants of their day to second class citizenship.    And what an honor for me, to stand among the giants of our day, if only for a moment, and see America's landscape from their gaze.    What this rally means, is that America's vista has now become as ravaged in its pristine hillside villas as it has always been for those of us who muddle behind the cities' shadows.    Our people are dying.    On the streets of America our people are dying.    Gathered tonight in this room are people from all walks of life; and for that reason, this is a very dangerous meeting for the powers that be.    They would like to see us divided.    I'm not just saying that. They wrote that in their COINTELPRO papers; about how they would keep blacks separated from each other, and separated from Africans, and separated from other people of color, and most importantly, separated from progressive activist whites. They wrote that they would discredit black activists so they would lose favor within their community and within our American community. They also wrote that they would replace authentic black leaders with what they called "clean Negroes" whom they had groomed to be more loyal to them than to us. Those aren't my words, they're their words.    Well, they were silly enough to write it down, and we were smart enough to read it. So we're not fooled.    But the Coalition of Artists and Activists has come together to show us that now is the time for us to get busy. And take our country back.    I, for one, can say that I am tired of burying innocent black and Latino people who die at the hands of this unjust system.    New Yorkers have buried too many loved ones and shed too many tears.    But sadly, every major city in America can probably call a roll: Ousmane Zongo, Alberta Spruill, Patrick Dorismond, Amadou Diallo; and those are just the names I know.    Not too far from here, the streets of Benton Harbor, Michigan exploded because they got tired of adding names to their roll. It wasn't enough that Terrance Shurn and Arthur Patterson, young adults, were on the list, but those names only topped off 16-year old Eric McGinnis and 7-year old Trent Patterson, who had also made the list.    I read that the NAACP called for calm and dialogue.    I'm sorry, but I can't be calm if my baby is going to be shot or hurt by out-of-control police.    I can't be calm when I drive through sections of Atlanta that look more like Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo than America.    I cannot be calm.    Dialogue must be followed by swift and deliberate action to root out racism at its very core. From a California gas station to a Mississippi Lockheed plant; from Cincinnati, Ohio to Benton Harbor, Michigan; to New York City, New York. And in Belle Glade, Florida where a young black man was found hanging from a tree, with his hands tied behind his back and the authorities call it suicide. In the 21st Century, America's trees still bear Strange Fruit.    How much injustice can any community absorb before an eruption of extraordinary proportions occurs?    And yes, we have our list in Georgia, too.    And so, placing troops in Cincinnati Ohio or in Benton Harbor to restore calm and "protect property" is about as helpful for the resolution of the problems of Ohio, or Michigan, or for that matter Black America as it is to place US troops in Liberia to resolve the problems on West Africa's oil-rich shore.    Or, for that matter, in the hot, oil-rich desert sands of Iraq.    And while the South Bend Tribune blared on its editorial page that Benton Harbor rioters must be held accountable, who will blare, if not us, that America must be held accountable for the sick and depraved conditions under which millions of our people now live.    Moreover, since that newspaper called for "accountability," I wonder, have I ever seen that word in the corporate press when describing the Bush Administration?    Now it is a fact that it was the Ashcroft Justice Department that gave law enforcement officials authority to use the no-knock warrant, like the one that resulted in the death of Mrs. Spruill.    But, I'm wondering where are the no-knock warrants for the Carlyle Group, Enron, DynCorp, Halliburton, Worldcom, HealthSouth, all the off-shore companies that fled our country to avoid paying taxes yet continue to get billions in federal contracts?    Where are their no-knock warrants?    And further, on this matter of accountability.    George Tenet recently "fell on the sword" as they say and took responsibility for the 16 untrue words that happened to find their way into George Bush's State of the Union Address.    But who among this Administration will take responsibility for the tragic events of September 11th and the tremendous intelligence failures that cost the lives of thousands of people who live and work in New York City?    Interestingly, I was the one who called for an investigation of September 11th asking the fully appropriate question, What did the Bush Administration know and when did it know it, about the tragic events of September 11th?    Both President Bush and Vice President Cheney asked Tom Daschle not to investigate what went wrong on September 11th. An Australian newspaper ran the headline, "Bosses so lax, agents felt they were spies." They were describing our FBI.    "Bosses so lax, agents felt they were spies."    To this day that I know of no one in any decision-making position in the whole of this Administration has accepted responsibility for failing the American people. Instead, from this Administration we have obstruction, obfuscation, dissembling, and deception.    And yet, the one who did her homework, and told the truth to the American people, that our investment of trillions of dollars in the defense and intelligence infrastructures of our country should not have all failed simultaneously four times on a single day and since they did, we deserve to know why they did. . .    Well, that's the person who got fired.    Meanwhile, George Bush and Dick Cheney, who remain in office, have the nerve to launch two simultaneous wars, at least one that is against international law; award no bid contracts to their friends in the defense industry; erode our Constitution and our Bill of Rights; put Paul Wolfowitz in charge of military tribunals (that same travesty of justice that we have excoriated other countries for in the past); put a felon, convicted of lying to Congress, in charge of our privacy; and lie about the rescue of Jessica Lynch, as well as the landing of America's top gunGeorge W.--on the deck of the USS Abraham Lincoln, which supposedly was out at sea, but that was really in San Diego harbor.    And this all comes after they stole the Presidency on the uncounted chads of black and Latino voters in a scheme that was orchestrated at the top.    Republicans rewarded Katherine Harris with a Congressional seat.    In Georgia, 48,000 Republicans crossed over and voted in the Democratic Primary for the black woman Republican that they had drafted to run in my Democratic Primary. Georgia and national Democrats failed to protect the integrity of their own primary. Terry McAuliffe crows today about protecting Gray Davis from any Democratic challenge in a primary, but where was he when he could have protected this black loyal Democratic woman from a known Republican shill acting for the Bush Administration?    And it's not enough for this Administration to accept responsibility for failing the American people. So too must the corporate media. Including the New York Times.    As you may know, I'm involved with Mike Ruppert of From the Wilderness in a national campaign that is placing anti-Bush ads in newspapers all across the country. Sadly, many newspapers are saying no to the paid ad or are giving us a hard time after they've accepted the money. The New York Times is no exception.    At the top of the ad is a cartoon. It features the big corporate media being "played" from behind the curtain by the great big, huge, Wizard. Like in the Wizard of Oz. But there, ever so small, at the bottom of the cartoon, is Toto, the little dog, pulling open the curtain and exposing the truth about the big, corporate mediakinda like BAI does here. And the alternative media do all over our country. Well, in the cartoon, Toto is the alternative media--getting the truth out to the people.    The text mentions oil, missing money from DoD and HUD accounts, the impeachment clause of the Constitution, the lawsuit that has been filed against the crossover voting in my election, and a special message from me.    My special message in the ad is this:    "Beware the Land of Oz. For it is only in the land of Oz that a handful of vainglorious men could send hundreds of thousands of young soldiers off to fight in an illegal war. And only in the Land of Oz can The Grand Wizard erode basic civil rights and call it enhanced security. And where but in Oz could a felon, convicted of lying in public, be put in charge of Total Information Awareness? 75 million Americans had no health insurance in 2001 or 2002. Unemployment is at an 8-year high. Meanwhile, at the Wizard's court, men of dubious reputation gorge themselves at the people's expense. Expose the Grand Wizard; this is our America, not Oz."    Now, just a few days ago, I received a message through the ad agency placing the ad that before The New York Times will run it, I need to prove that what I say about Oz is true. Can you believe. . . The New York Times is fact-checking cartoons now?    Or is it just this cartoon?   They didn't bother to fact-check their story about me that's recounted in Greg Palast's book, "The Best Democracy Money Can Buy." They just printed lies about me in an effort to make sure that a black Republican woman from New York City who is anti-affirmative action and anti-reparations would sit at the table of the Congressional Black Caucus and represent you in Washington, DC.    In 1776, it was King George III who drove the titans of the American colony to write our Declaration of Independence. They wrote that there are certain unalienable rights and that it is the responsibility of government to protect, preserve, and promote these rights. However, in the words of its signers,    "when a long train of abuses and usurpations, . . . evinces a design to reduce [a people to life] under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security."    And with that, a rebellion became a revolution.   My mother didn't want me to give this speech tonight. I'm sure it's hard for her to read the terrible things the corporate press and right-wing activists write about me.    In today's America, she's right. I will probably get in trouble for what I've said to you tonight. But it won't be the first time I get in trouble for telling the truth. And I'll continue to tell the truth. As I have said before, I won't sit down and I won't shut up.    I agree with Dead Prez: We need a revolution!   And it needs to start with us.    Thank you so much for inviting me to be with you tonight.

      Ward Connerly and Proposition 54 By David Muhammad,  August 5, 2003   Claiming to be building a colorblind California, Ward Connerly has launched another racially charged ballot initiative to ban public agencies from collecting data on race and ethnicity in California. The author of Proposition 209, the statewide initiative voters passed in 1996 banning affirmative action in state institutions, Connerly says race is irrelevant.   Proposition 54 is the number assigned Monday to the new measure. It will appear on the ballot in just a little over two months, on Oct. 7, along with the questions of whether Gov. Gray Davis should be recalled and who should replace him.   Connerly, an African American former University of California official and his organization, the American Civil Rights Institute, has spent nearly $2 million to garner the needed signatures to place the initiative on a statewide ballot to be decided on by the voters. The initiative would prohibit state, county and local government agencies from asking about race on all forms and documents, including statistics on hate crimes, health care, education, the judicial system and others.   This state has become increasingly diverse but also has huge economical, educational and health disparities - which we know about because we have the data. With this initiative, we would not have that data, said Maria Blanca, national senior counsel for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF).   The most populous state in the nation, California is also to the most diverse, recently becoming predominately non-white, according to the 2000 census.   Blanca and other opponents of the initiative gathered at a forum hosted by New California Media, a coalition of ethnic media agencies, at the San Francisco Commonwealth Club. The participants represented various fields that would be affected by the pending proposition: schools, hospitals, researchers, law enforcement and more.   African American and Latino youth are more likely to be sent to state correctional institutions than white youth for the same crime, and in San Francisco, Black students are four times more likely to be suspended and expelled than white students, said Maya Harris West, project director for the ACLUs Racial Project.   In Alameda County, with Oakland as its major city, Blacks make up just 17 percent of the overall population, but Blacks make up a startling 70 percent of the incarcerated youth, according to recent study by Huskey & Associates. Such data would be illegal to collect in Connerlys colorblind state.   State agencies responsible for enforcing Civil Rights would be prohibited from collecting data on race - what sense does that make, asked Ted Wang, executive director of Chinese for Affirmative Action.   The disparities in the state, which are similar throughout the country, are glaring for Blacks: AIDS rates, incarceration rates, school dropout rates, poverty rates and many others show that Blacks face a much harsher reality than most other people.   African Americans have the highest rate of infant mortality in the state. But if this initiative passed, we would know that infant mortality was 5.4 per 1,000 infants in the state, but we would not know that for African Americans it is more than double - 12.8 per 1,000, said Vivian Huang, senior policy analyst for California Primary Care Association.   They create the environment that produces these deplorable conditions for Blacks then outlaw the ability to document, make public and expose the condition, said Martin Jacks, founder of The Mentoring Center, an organization that serves incarcerated youth and relies on data that charts disproportionate incarceration rates for Blacks.   With Latinos surpassing Blacks as the largest ethnic group in the country and soon to be the majority population in the state, Connerly says Latinos should not benefit from Affirmative Action   Connerly told the Washington Post, Latinos want to see affirmative action policies remain so they can take advantage of them. They want to claim minority status when, in fact, they will soon be a majority in California.   Here is a man claiming to be colorblind but is fanning the flames of racial divisiveness, said Blanca.

      Rappers' Glorification of Pimps Deserves Disdain By DeWayne Wickham,  August 5, 2003   This fall, not too long after kids go back to school, a new animated movie will appear in theaters across the country. It is the latest in a genre of films that use the voices of well-known actors to bring life to a series of drawings. Labeled a comedy, this movie is nothing to laugh about.   It is the story of a 9-year-old pimp. That's right, I said pimp--as in one of those degenerates who peddle female flesh for a living. Lil' Pimp, as this film is called, is the cinematic manifestation of a pop-cultural attempt to glamorize this repugnant lifestyle.   In the twisted world of this movie's story line, the young pimp is a good guy, and the mayor of its imaginary city is sleazy. Not surprisingly, the voices of several of the characters belong to some of rap music's raunchiest acts.   Rap music has a love affair with pimps. And it is the broad appeal of rap artists who glorify pimping that has likely convinced Hollywood that there's a profit to be made in a movie about a pre-pubescence boy "who hustles his ho's around the neighborhood."   For years, rap artists have spiked their salacious lyrics with talk of these bottom feeders.   But recently some have gone from talking about pimps to acting like them. In their latest video titled P.I.M.P. rappers 50 Cent and Snoop Dogg prance before the camera in the flashy, gaudy attire of a pimp.   Video Just The Latest   Their video is just the latest in what has become a steady stream of rap songs that celebrate pimps as hot-dressing, slick-talking, women-running men and ignore both the cruelty and criminality of the profession.   "I think it (rap artists' infatuation with pimps) has sort of dumbed down rap music and its constituency," said DeVone Holt, whose book Hip-Hop Slop: The Impact of a Dysfunctional Culture, will be published next month. "They've surrendered their authentic artistic traits and settled for the less-demanding challenge of selling sex. That probably takes the least amount of talent when you're selling sex because you're just appealing to folks' natural desires."   Holt, 30, who grew up on a steady diet of rap music, said that it's not what it used to be. "The traits that drew me to hip-hop are the same ones that are drawing kids today," Holt said. "Hip-hop and rap music are a rebellious music, a rebellious culture. But in the days when I grew up listening to it, hip-hop and rap rebelled against oppressive institutions. Today, they just rebel against traditional values."   Redefining Culture   More to the point, a growing number of rap performers are trying to redefine the culture by turning one of society's dregs the pimp into an acceptable lifestyle. In his recent music video titled Pimp Juice, rapper Nelly gave cameo roles to Max Julien, an aging actor who played a pimp in the 1973 movie, The Mack, and a one-time, real-life pimp named Bishop Don "Magic" Juan.   Snoop Dogg not only sings about pimping, he said he wants to be a pimp. A former Los Angeles-area gang member, Snoop says he has given up his gang-bangin' days for pimping because pimps live longer.   Now that's dysfunctional. Like too many rappers, Snoop has a big bankroll and low self-esteem. Rather than aspire to be something more than his great musical skills helped him to escape, Snoop wants to emulate the high-living style of a lowlife.   While Snoop's immense talent has lifted him out of the ghetto, it hasn't taken the ghetto out of him.   "If it's wrong to call a woman a b with $2 in your pocket," Holt said of the language pimps regularly use to describe women, "it's wrong to call a woman a b with $2 million in your pocket."   He's right. Rap stars who glamorize the pimp lifestyle deserve our disdain. And movie producers who try to profit, hopefully, will lose their shirts.

      I've been hesistant to ever compare the United States government to facism, but after looking at the Patriot Act in action, I can say, with authority, that our country is moving down the road to Ultra-Nationalism.  By definition, that means we are going to be living in an increasingly facist state.  Wonder why I say this?  Read-  From-  www.raisethefist.com   SHERMAN AUSTIN SENTENCED TO ONE YEAR IN FEDERAL PRISON   Sherman Austin, webmaster of RaisetheFist.com, was sentenced today, August 4, 2003, to one year in federal prison, with three years of probation. Judge Wilson shocked the courtroom when he went against the recommendation of not only the prosecution, but the FBI and the Justice Department, who had asked that Austin be sentenced to 4 months in prison, and 4 months in a half-way house, with 3 years of probation.   Austin's probation stipulates, among other things, that (1) he cannot possess or access a computer of any kind without prior approval of his probation officer, (2) if his probation officer gives permission, the equipment is subject to monitoring and is subject to search and seizure at any time, without notice, (3) he cannot alter any of the software or hardware on any computer he uses, (4) he must surrender his phone, DSL, electric, and satellite bills, (5) he cannot associate with any person or group that seeks to change the government in any way (be that environmental, social justice, political, economic, etc.), and (6) he must pay over $2,000 in fines and restitution. Austin must surrender himself to the Federal Bureau of Prisons by September 3, 2003.   To contact sherman, email keepfistraised@yahoo.com   FROM SHERMAN AUSTIN:   On Jan 24, 2002 , my home was surrounded and raided by approximately 25 heavily armed FBI and Secret Service agents in one of the governments first attempts to exercise the new US Patriot Act. I was interrogated for several hours while they ransacked my room and they seized a network of computers which I used to run my web site raisethefist.com. They also seized protest signs, and political literature. Their excuse was a protest guide (which I didn't author) that was posted to my site which a small portion contained information on explosives. The FBI had been monitoring the site long before this was ever posted, and long before Sept 11. The "explosives information" on my site (again which I didn't author) doesn't compare to what you an find on any other web sites such as howthingswork.com, Loompanics.com, Bombshock.com, Totse.com, Amazon.com, or the many neo nazi web sites which cover everything from assassinations, explosives, fraud and firearms. It's obvious a web surfer interested in making a bomb or taking part in other extra-illegal activities would not have to rely on Raisethefist.com. So how could the "bomb making information" on raisethefist.com be a concern to authorities? It wasn't a concern, it was simply used an excuse to exercise the new Patriot Act and take down the site. And that's what they did when federal agents spent 5-6 hours interrogating me while they disassembled each computer one by one , mirrored each hard drive, then loaded everything into a big white truck. During this whole process I was told I wasn't going to be arrested, and that I could even leave if I wanted to. Once the agents finished packing everything up, Special Agent John I. Pi, who was conducting the investigation and raid said that I had crossed a line, and as long as I got back on the other side of that line I'd be okay.   A week later despite what happened I still continued with my plans to attend the demonstration against the World Economic Forum in NY. As I was waiting for the march to begin, a swarm of NYPD officers rushed straight at me and scooped up about 26 people, one of which was me. We sat on a bus for 7 hours before being taken to Brooklyn Navy Yard Jail. I was there for about 30 hours before I was taken out of my cell and put into a backroom in handcuffs and interrogated once again by the FBI and Secret Service for several hours. They asked me questions such as if I was a terrorist or involved in any terrorist organizations. During the interrogation I noticed more and more agents walking through the room. I was told I wouldn't leave custody unless they searched my car. I said I had nothing to hide and simply wanted to go home. Stressed and aggravated, I signed over my keys. A few minutes later I was driven to the court and released. As I was waiting for someone to pick me up, about 5 FBI agents entered the court and said I was arrested for "distribution of information related to explosives over the internet". One of the agents grabbed my neck and told me to shut the fuck up while I tried to tell one of the legal observers I was being arrested. I was hurried out of the court house into a black SUV where I was driven to a federal building. I was then taken to lower Manhattan MCC maximum security 24 hour lockdown federal jail facility. At my bail hearing the FBI called me a "man on a mission" and said I drove 3,000 miles to carry out my alleged "plot". The judge said I was a "threat to the community" and denied me bail, and I was to be extradited back to California to face my charges. After 11 days I was shackled and taken to an airforce base where federal inmates are boarded onto planes surrounded by guards with M16's and shot guns, like prisoners of war, and flown to a federal jail "hub" in Oklahoma. Once I got there, I learned the next day that the prosecutors decided not to file an indictment. I was released after spending 13 days in custody. When I got back to Los Angeles I put raisethefist.com back up almost immediately. I continued my political organizing within the community, as well as my work with Raise the Fist which developed into a Direct Action Network with chapters setup around the world. 6 months later prosecutors contacted my lawyer and said they found nothing to prosecute me for on my computers, but didn't want to "let me off the hook". They offered me a pre-indictment binding plea agreement which was initially 1 month in jail, and 5 months in a "community corrections facility". I rejected the plea at first, wanting to go to trial until we discovered the case was eligible for a terrorism enhancement, which could have added 20 years to my sentence.   I therefore decided to enter a plea. I played months of legal limbo until I finally expected to get sentenced to 4 months in jail and 4 months in a community corrections facility based on the final pre-sentencing report written by the USPO. The judge rejected the 4 months saying what kind of an example would it set for "future revolutionaries" wanting to act in the same manner. He stated he wanted to give me at least 8-10 months but first wanted the opinion of the Justice Department and the Director of the FBI in Washington, DC (Robert Muller). My sentencing was rescheduled several times until August 4th. I was convicted for felony; distribution of information related to explosives with intent, and sentenced to 1 year in federal prison with 3 years supervised release.   Distribution of information related to explosives is not illegal.. What's illegal is the INTENT part. They have to prove you have intent to use the information to cause further crime of violence .. and how do they prove intent? I think Bush made it clear when he said "you're either with me or against me".   Remember, fascism and a police state doesn't come all at once, it comes piece by piece. How far will we allow it go until we are all locked up in concentration camps.   If we don't take matters into our own hands and do something about this now, then we are already prisoners of war.   Raisethefist.com is not shutting down, and the RTF Direct Action Network will continue to grow and remain active. A 1 year sentence is not the end of this. It's just the begining.

      I don't see why I bother to write everything that's on my mind.  Even moreso, I disguise really interesting stuff in odd Christian metaphorical stories.  Oh well, it's a method of speaking, but I can't write currently.  I've seriously contemplated writting a million things, but I can't, something is eating away at me, and I really don't know what it is.  It's like this burning sensation down in the pit of my stomach.  Damn, I really need to just do something pointless.

      I knew this would happen.  I returned to camp to vist Nia, and I liked it.  I'd been afraid of returning because I knew this would happen, I knew I'd want to come back if I went.  I knew it, I knew it, I knew it.  To tell the truth, I don't know what t think.  I've felt empty since I left there this afternoon, just not like myself.  I really don't want to write much more about it, but it's just burning into me, and I don't know what to think.

      The "Quaker Reader" is seriously some heavy reading that'll put you on your ass.  I'm pretty convinced after reading their writtings that many of them did actually communicate with God on a normal basis.  This one guy goes up to a really high class noble woman, who got him out of jail to try and convince him to accept the Church of England just falsly.  You know the first thing he said to her "Woman what do you want?"    These guys were insane.   This one woman in New England was banned from entering Boston ever again on threat od Death because she was a Quaker, but she believed in Religious Freedom she went back up to either make them rennounce the law or to have herself hung so others would question the law.  She goes up there, and they are about to hang her and refuse, and send her back to Virginia or something.  So now she's convinced that if they kill her, it will force tolerance down their throats.  So she goes to New England again and is hanged.  I was just like "Damn!" that's conviction.  Well, I'm going to vist Nia tommorow at Camp.  That'll be fun.  Signing off.

      So Aunt Susan died.  Bam, she goes from having a flu to being dead.  Died of the same thing my Uncle did four years ago.  It doesn't suck as much for me, as it does for everyone else.  I mean, she was my absolute favorite relative, and saying some melodramatic bullshit like "Oh, I'll remember the good moments" is some serious bullshit.  I didn't like her for good things, I liked her because she spoke her mind, and she'd do it consistently.  I'd leave her house feeling pretty good sometimes, and I'd leave it feeling like shit sometimes.    That's not what I'm worried about.  I feel bad when I see other people sad about it.  Nia seems to just be getting that through, I know Moms been falling apart.  Dad's known Aunt Susan since High School (infact he knew her before he knew my mom) and Grammy lost one of her own kids.  But the real person I feel sad thinking about is Lauren.  Fortunately, she's out of college, but she's been orphaned at 20, which puts her in an extremely awkward posistion.    To add to the sucking, most of my friends knew her as well.  I mean, if you knew her and are reading this you probubly feel a bit sucky as well.  So tommorow, when I tell my teachers I could do no homework, I'll have to accept there pity for my aunt dying.  I don't want pity, I didn't die and it's no one's fault.  Of anything, I'm feeling slightly, bitter, which could just be me expressing emotions.  I've thought about it all day, how I should react if she were to die, I figured being emotionless about it would be pointless, and crying accomplishes nothing, but being angry, I guess it drives me to accomplish things.  Pissed off people get stuff done.    The funeral, I don't really want to attend.  My moms side of the family doesn't get cremated, so I probubly would feel worse seeing my aunt's dead face.  That would seriously suck, considering she was lively enough on Saturday.  Being the so called "Chaplan" of the family, I know I'm going to have to give a bible verse, which I'm not going to do.  I'm not going to just say "God let's us suffer, accept it, be happy, worship, suffer, die."  I've not been like that for awhile.  I'm going to be a realist.  I don't believe, and haven't believed, that "God" is some perfect omnipotent being in the sky.  A perfect God, makes a perfect Universe.  An imperfect God, makes an imperfect universe.  Anyone who can show me how pain and suffering fit into God's divine plan please tell me.  Please tell me why, we have to suffer under some sick form of Chattel Slavery, because some woman wanted to elevate her level of intelligence, and bring her man along for the ride.  Just explain to me, how us gaining wisdom is a bad thing?  Whatever.   I'll plan up what I'm going to say on Thursday, and if I'm lucky, I'll get to see Jacob (who was fortunately spurred on by Aunt Susan to go to College).

      I just did a variation of some Peter Carrol-esque method of gaining gnosis.  To be honest the results were pretty frightening, but the joy of it actually working seems to cover it up.   I intentionally tried to shut off my psyche, and it worked more or less.  The problem with not having any rational thought is that nothing really goes into memory.  I did the process twice because I barely remember the first time.   It was in short, me straining my arms first, and then getting light headed, and then tensing all my muscles towards my lungs and then standing up and whhooosh. I'm out.  It was alot like how we'd pass out at camp, but this time it had a purpose.  I remember thinking as I held my breath and lay on the bed that it wasn't working.  Then something, something I couldn't remember the insant I regained consciousness.  It was something in a circle of blackness both times, and I know it was something material, but because of the fact that my normal brain processes weren't going on I retained none of it, other then knowing something important happened.  Pretty strange, and apparently not the way to retain much of anything.  Anyone who does weed, should try it, and see if it's anything like it.

      The leaf, that damn leaf.  It's been all I've been thinking of all season.  I was so sad when the people who owned bush cut most of it's branches off and it was leafless, now the leaves have finally all grown back, and the leaf I see has something wrong with one half of it.  Why?  Why does life have to be like that?  Is it part of some divine plan to make some things painfully imperfect?

      I was walking home from school today, and turned into my neighborhood.  Normally, I pull random leaves off this bush that I walk by, it's my "leaf pulling bush" if you will.  So I saw one leave that caught my eye, it was slightly torn on one side.  So against my better judgement I grabbed for it as I walked by.  I ended up getting three leaves, one was torn completely to shreds.  So I dropped that one.  The other one was tiny, and didn't have a central vein yet, so I dropped that one. The final leaf was the original one I wanted.    The leaf didn't look overly significant, I guess.  It was a green leaf, normal for a bush.  It had a central vein running up the center, and had a pointed tip.  The cut in it's right side is what bothered me.  It's better half was cut.  I looked at it, I'd already plucked it, so I knew it would wither away soon, but could the leaf ever have been fixed?  Or was the leaf ruined from the start?  I thought about that for a bit, looked at the leaf somemore, and realized, their was no easy answer.  I'd either throw the leaf away, or continue to hold onto it wanting to find a way to fix it.  In the end I dropped it.

      Friday is tommorow.  Joy.  The thing I've always loved about fiction is that you can talk about stuff indirectly.  So you feel you've said something to the whole world, but at the same time none of them consciously understand.    Football game to day?  Depressing, especially with the huge turn out.  Work? So much of it to do.    New story idea (since the last story I posted will remain incomplete), about biting nails and negative emotions around a person.  Something very relevant, and far deeper then it'd seem.    Eye itches.  Weekend?  What the hell am I doing this weekend?    Gaia, crazy stuff.  Crazy, crazy stuff.  It's pretty fun stuff now that we have an audience of Freshmen to talk strangely about.  While they all group together into some strange little cabal (not unlike us...)  sounds like a microcasm.  Johnson and Afghanistan-Solider teacher having a love affair?  Hmmmm....

      Okay Seneca in Toronto is my dream school.  I'm pretty sick of America is it is, so why not go to one of the four countries that are pretty damn close to being America?  The other three of course being England, Australia, and New Zealand.  But seriously, Seneca looks to good to be true only 8000 dollars for two semesters?  Holy shit.  That's perfectamente, largest college in Canada as well, and they like international students.  Damn, it looks so perfect.  Then I've got McGill on the list as well, because, it's also in Canada.  Then my two American choices would be Brown (I wish) and University of Virginia.

      Dear Marcus,  Read your computer journal if your searching these archives.  I know you wrote something.  -Marcus   Anyway, I'm listening to "Ward of the StateII", and it still puts me on my ass.  I've never heard any song that can actually evoke an emotional response other then this song.  It's just... damn, it's just a heavy song.  It has alot more angst then other rap, and the fact that it's justified from first hand experience only makes it heavier.  Yeah, I'm holding my tongue for awhile.  It's bad not to let off pressure, especially of the mental/social type, but whatever.  I'm holding this one in vatos, so take a hit of this and go home.

      This is from a girl named "Blkbtrfly" on Deadprez.net/Deadprez.com  Someone reposted it recently, and it's a pretty heavy piece, I've always thought:  When I was five years old, I loved to sit in the kitchen and watch my sisters straighten their hair. It seemed so magical to watch those nasty naps disappear to be replaced by beautiful, long, straight, black hair. My favorite past time as I grew up was going with my mama to the beauty shop to watch all those women sit all day to have their kitchens fixed with a hot combed or some hot stuff that made them scream after a while. I laughed until my sides ached when hey would yell, Take it off! Take it off! You better get this shit off my head before my hair fall out!  I loved those days so much that I used to dream of the day that I would someday stand in the kitchen asking somebody to hold my ear or sit for hours at the hair shop to get my hair fixed. I even dreamed of being a hairdresser. My day finally arrived when the choir director at my church said that nobody could wear cornrows for the concert. My dad had never let me get my hair permed or straightened, but on this day we went straight to the shop to get me a Jerry Curl! I was so cool! My hair was longer than I had ever seen it, and those naps that made me cry, when my sister braided my hair each Friday night, were gone. I had long, shiny curls. It was the happiest day in my life, I thought.  As life goes for the average black woman living in the U.S., I went from Jerry Curl to Soft and Beautiful, Bone Straight, Luster Silk, Hawaiian Silky, Dudleys, Creme of Nature, Sheenique, Motions...you know the line up! I even followed my dreams through and became a hairdresser. I followed the part to a T! I told black women how nappy their hair was when I saw them, convinced them that I could get rid of that problem by fixing their hair with a hot comb or a perm. Yeh, I fixed them, I fixed them alright........  Though I didnt know why at the time, I left the hair straightening industry after three short years.  So about five years ago, I decided I was tired of burning my scalp and my ears, so I started braiding my hair. I hated how nappy it got in just a few days, however. I would texturize some of it just to make it manageable sometimes. About 3 years ago, I got heavily into hip-hop and my own Afrikan history. I began to discover the essence of being true to oneself, you know... Keeping it Real! While keeping it real meant different things to different people, what it meant to me was that I could do whatever I wanted with myself, so I did. I stopped changing the texture of my hair!  bell hooks visited my area about a year ago and we had a chance to discuss one of her new books, Sisters of the Yam: Black Women and Self-Recovery. This book changed my life in a couple of ways. While hooks always indicts the white, supremacist, capitalist patriarchy so eloquently, she most touched me with her ideas about black nihilism. I have looked closely at how historical inequality and oppression manifests itself among our community. One of the key tactics of this covert warfare being waged against Afrikans living in the U.S. is nihilism, which leads our people to adopt mainstream values and traditions that are senseless and useless to our communities. In essence, we are killing ourselves through self-hate and community mutilation. While this is obvious in scenarios of extreme crack infestations, black-on-black crime, objectification and rejection of black women and so on, it is also dangerous, as it is pervasive in the very foundations of who were are--OUR HAIR!  When I first started wearing my hair natural, my people were outraged and offended. Of course, there was an occasional brotha or sista with locks that felt me, but in general, I encountered harsh reactions.   Please process this slowly....We were born with locks and have been trained to hate them, therefore hate ourselves and others who keep them! When I went to church with my hair natural, the children ran up to me and said, You need a perm! An eight-year-old girl had already been indoctrinated to hate herself to the point that she was advising me on how to make in this world. I cried for her that night.  Our recovery has to begin with who we are and if you are a black woman or know any black women, then you know that our hair is a big part of who were are. I now know that I stopped doing hair and stopped straightening my own because of the war going on inside of me.   We have been trained to hate ourselves, but its not natural. If we surround ourselves in self-loving, conscious-raising environments, before long we can all come to this realization.  ____________________________________________________________________  Seriomente.

      Here's a random entry from "The Devil You Know", it's before the pliot really sets off, and the main character, who's name I don't really care about, writes about his experiences for reasons he doesn't understand.  In this entry he comes to terms with his reasons for writting.  He has recently got into a fight with his parents about him dropping out his senior year, and he's moving out.  December 31, 1999  	Holy shit.  Its Y2K, another fucking conspiracy to throw people into a panic so more black people can get lynched in Louisiana or some other fucking farm state.  Me, Ive almost completely moved out.  This is the last entry Im writing stuck up in this damn house.  I got work starting at Checkers on Monday, and Ive sold all my shit to give me money to move out ahead of schedule.  I might deal, but that shit doesnt pull in enough money for the risk, only people wholl buy second hand shit from me are white kids, and they dont pay shit.  Why the fuck cant I live in the BX?  Shit.  At least it could be like that movie Empire Id be one rich vato that way.    	Fuck.  I couldnt finish all my papers, Ill just get a damn GED or some shit in May or something. Ill study for that shit later. Education doesnt mean shit anyway.   Its just some bullshit they fill your head with, so the feds can convince you to vote. Bullshit.  I went out with Kaaliyah yesterday, we needed to build up some tolerance for tonight, since I know Im gonna get fucked at Rahims party tonight.    	How much do I wanna bet the pigs are gonna bust that shit?  How much?  And then Kaaliyah, shes way to serious for a drinking buddy.  Shes a freak when she gets drunk, not like Im gonna just lay down and fuck with her, because shes been with like a dozen guys.  Its just its like all this shit they teach us in school is to put on a mask this proper mask of some fucking European idol of perfection, but its all bullshit.  Were all fucking monster, who only eat, sleep, shit and fuck.  Thats why when people start doing that shit everyone else gets afraid and says Fucking put back on your fucking mask!  Its all for shit.  Seriously.  Im only gonna get older and die.  This shit is why I made myself a journal maybe one day Ill go all Malcolm X and have this autobiography that everyone reads. I wish.

      And I still got a sinking feeling in my stomach, and it's not from the bad food I ate.  It's this feeling of anxiousness, mixed with fear.  Something I want because it'll make me happy, and something I fear won't.  Something. Normally, I would have written today, given an explict entry in my story of pent-up anger in a person manifesting itself in the worst ways... but you know what?  I couldn't write.  When I was pissed to be doing hard labor, ideas, so many ideas swarmed through my head, and I knew this, but just as quickly they were all forgotten.  In an instant.  In a heart beat, poof, bi-allah al-ra'is al-na'im is gone!

      I prefer not to write chronologically, it's not completely how a persons mind works.  Your personality is shaped by your experiences, so those are always the first things on your mine.  I went to Cold Stone with Nia and Dad at the end of the day.  Anita was there with Sarah, she told me Columbia beat Seton Hall.  I wanted to go to the game but my dear Grandma had me doing a shitload of hard labor, if only I had an excuse you could have actually hired a strong man to do it, rather then wiry little me.  Whatever, I got 20 bucks, and she bought me dinner, so I can't really complain.  Just looked on Guerillafunk.com, and saw he, Paris, had the Lyrics up for one of the songs on his Album.  "Evil" is the name.  I really need to get it.  Evil  They dont mind you givin the latest rap They dont mind your being hoes They dont mind your being bitches They dont mind you being whatever image that Viacom and BET can come up with But what they dont want you to know... Is that youre the ones that can redefine civilization if you take time to do it   Its a Guerrilla Funk-orchestrated counter-attack Formulate and infiltrate em so the people react See if I was wicked I would pick and stick to a plan To rule the world and trick em, this is how itd begin   See Id have to find a way to keep the people enslaved Behave, teach the babies its my way or the grave And start with the body, workin labor for free And give em fake religion so they worshippin me   And see and when the free labor play out, Id let it go But only after I made enough to control Then Id tell em that the Afterlife is better than this And that they should love their enemies when faced with contempt   Id persist with some history that I would rewrite In a school system where Id keep the money too tight Id let em all know just where they belong in my world Turn the boys into felons, makin hookers of girls  Swirled up in my plan, build jails to keep All my prisons full of niggas, have em workin for free See with ghetto-economics in check, Id keep em broke Teach em only to respect sports, music and dope  Control the content of lyrics, now only the sound Of sex, dope and murder in a song is allowed Tell em Niggas aint shit every move that they make And that black is dirty so they never try to be great  Can you relate? Id laugh, watch em murder for scraps Set it up so theyd die over crack I provide Do it right, and Id see they try to be like me Try to be the biggest G up in these murderous streets  Id teach, manhood means how many women ya fuck How many babies you can make, responsibility ducked Fuck a job, real men are pimps, thats what Id teach And if bitches wanna trip, then them bitches get beat  Id see it all through, never lose and pass a new law Give em 3 strikes so the men are constantly gone Yeah, if I was evil they would think I do no wrong See its lethal how I keep em in their place so long, believe  Chorus: I got my eyes upon you, and all the things that you do Some close they eyes but mine can see, all the evil surroundin me So what Im posed ta do, when I can see right through? Expose the lies and snatch the sheets, fight the evil surroundin me  After all is said and done here and I could afford Id concentrate deeply on controllin abroad And think about a way to take control of they land Id create a virus made to murder people en masse  Last time was Tuskegee, but now its for real House Bill 15090 would just kill With germs that would murder with sperm and blood drips And kill em all worser than burned, theyd die quick  See to understand, you could witness the plan Through the green-monkey sham they would think it began And while we argue over the cost, theyd all die With generations all being lost with no fight  Id continue with the pain, make it oh-so plain Id manipulate the market for my capital gain Keep the people all broke and confused and underclass Give my homies all executive bonuses through the crash  And if the heat get too hot, Id plant a bomb Or wreck a plane, just like Hitler back in the day And scare all the people, theyd forget about me Theyd forget about elections and the way that we cheated  See me blame it on a foreigner and non-white men Celebrate my gestapo with a positive spin Then manipulate the media - its U.S. first Get the stupid-ass public to agree with my words  Then Id make the play, takin all their freedoms away Incarcerate anybody thatll get in my way Make em censor any media that challenge the mold Give em bullshitty shows just like Anna Nicoles  Control the message in the music - its gangsta fo sho Give em diamonds, never tell em bout the conflict zones Never tell em bout the murder in Sierra Leone Never tell em how the diamonds make em murder their own  Its all too easy, if I was evil thats how Id rock it Make sure that my propaganda wont ever stop it Got 120 channels, but its nothin to watch Now 11:55 be the time on the clock, believe...

      So much Television.  I watched Boston Public today, but seriomente it's getting old.  I mean why the hell is Steven going out with Marilyn?  Why is the new physics teacher sexy.... Like... huh?  To much over the top stuff is starting to happen and it's getting pretty ugly.  Oh, and Degrassi Crash Course, JT finally looks like a man, rather then a ten year old boy.  Sort of like what happened to Roger on Sister-Sister.    Work at Grandma's tommorow.  She's trying to claim I'm learning something from this, but in reality, despite the fact she has money, and lives in a house that could house a 10 person family, she still wants me to do the shit work outside the house.  She may not understand, but I have school, and at the same time due to stupid black family values, I'm completely unable to say "no" to half the outlandish and crazy request she makes.  It makes no sense! None.

      How the hell is one supposed to react when someone calls them hot? Lots of indirect usage of pronouns there chicos.  Speaking of Spanish, Mun2 is such a great channel.  I feel the  Latino -ness just watching that channel for a few minutes.  It's like a Spanish MTV on Cable (not Sattelite to my knowledge), it's designed for  Los Jovenes Espanoles  and is soo... good.  Most of the shows are in English, but like  Siempre de los commericiales y mucho videos musicales son en Espanol  and yes I do think Spanish looks sexier in Italics.  Like one of the shows reminds me of MTV Hip-Hop or A bit like Rap City (the better of the two mentioned shows because it's not on M-oh-yeah-now-T-we-want-black-people-to-watch-us-V) with a female host as well.  It's pretty ugly, in a good way, and I seriously am going over to Aunty Claires (joke) to watch that all the time.  Oh.  Check out Guerillafunk.com, "Evil" the song is really tight.  You gotta hear it, the album is out in like six days.  And in the words of Dead Prez, "One thing about Music when it hits you feel no pain."

      Off of Guerilla Funk.com.  Dammmit, Dammit, Dammit.  I forgot to post my story today, and am to lazy to go upstairs and copy it to a disk.  So I guess it'll have to wait another day or so.  Whose War? By Andrew Gumbel,  September 16, 2003   With the casualty rate in Iraq growing by the day and President George Bush's worldwide "war on terrorism" showing no signs of abating, a stretched United States military is turning increasingly to Latinos - including tens of thousands of non-citizen immigrants - to do the fighting and dying on its behalf.  Senior Pentagon officials have identified Latinos as by far the most promising ethnic group for recruitment, because their numbers are growing rapidly in the US and they include a plentiful supply of low-income men of military age with few other job or educational prospects.  Recruitment efforts have also extended to non-citizens, who have been told by the Bush administration that they can apply for citizenship the day they join up, rather than waiting the standard five years after receiving their green card. More than 37,000 non-citizens, almost all Latino, are currently enlisted. Recruiters have even crossed the border into Mexico - to the fury of the Mexican authorities - to look for school-leavers who may have US residency papers.  The aim, according to Pentagon officials, is to boost the Latino numbers in the military from roughly 10 per cent to as much as 22 per cent. That was the figure cited recently by John McLaurin, a deputy assistant secretary of the army, as the size of the "Hispanic ... recruiting market", and it has also been bandied about in the pages of the Army Times.  But while officials praise the willingness of Mexican Americans and other Latinos, the strategy has been denounced by anti-war groups as a cynical exploitation of impoverished young men who are lined up to be little more than cannon fodder.  Rick Jahnkow, of the Committee Opposed to Militarism and the Draft, said: "They are vulnerable economically. That's why they are targeting them. [These people are] going to provide them with the means to carry out future wars."  Recent statistics from the Pew Hispanic Centre, a non-partisan think-tank, show that Latinos are already doing the most dangerous combat jobs in disproportionate numbers. While they are still under- represented in the armed forces as a whole - they made up 9.4 per cent of enlisted men in 2001, compared with 13.4 per cent of the general population - they are over-represented in jobs that involve handling weapons (17.7 per cent).  In Iraq, the first US casualty was a Latino non- citizen, a Guatemalan orphan raised in Los Angeles called Jose Gutierrez. Although a precise breakdown of ethnic numbers is not available, the Pentagon's list of dead and wounded has included dozens of Spanish names. At least 10 out of almost 300 dead have been non-citizens.  An ethnic group has never before been the target of such a recruitment drive.  In the Vietnam war, when the US military was still conscripting soldiers for compulsory service, the de facto characteristic of the men who did the fighting and dying was class. Poor people - whether black, white or Mexican - were much more likely to be drafted, and more likely to find themselves in the front lines.  Now the military operates what Mr Jahnkow calls a "poverty draft" - selling itself as an attractive career option or stepping stone to further education in communities that have few other options. In the poorer parts of the country, army recruiters talk to children as early as primary school. At a predominantly Latino high school in east Los Angeles, students became so exasperated by the presence of army recruiters at careers fairs that they began a campaign to get rid of them with the slogan "students not soldiers".  Such activities are apparently common even across the border. A recruiter in San Diego told an Army radio show: "It's more or less common practice that some recruiters go to Tijuana to distribute pamphlets, or in some cases they look for someone to help distribute the information on the Mexican side." A recruiter who visited a technical high school in Tijuana in May triggered a diplomatic incident after the headmaster threw him out and the Mexican government protested vehemently to Washington. The army subsequently sought to deny that this was standard practice.

      I love being angry.  It's great to write when your angry, it just bottles up the emotion.  I was planning on putting an entry of what I wrote yesterday here.  I think I was gonna call the story "The Devil You know" in reference to the phrase "The Devil you know is worse then the Devil you Don't" but alas fucking psat classes ruined that.  Why am I cursing so much? Maybe it's the stress of being herded into some stupid exploitive system, of giving a test that is more geared for people with money to succeed and most American colleges are based around.  It's the thing of the rich getting richer, and the poor getting poorer.  Filthy rich capitalist with their blood money.  Makes me sick.  If God Wills it (insha allah), so says the confused mystic (it's a Quaker word), maybe school will be flooded out tommorow although I doubt God has ever been quite so nice.  Except with Floyd, I would pray for it,  but I have objections with praying just like I have objections with swearing oaths. For example- If your praying that means you don't aknowledge your always in communication with God, similar to if your taking an oath, it says your not normally truthful.

      Tonight, I'm gonna start writting tonight.   Why does writting make me happy?  Like, some people get happy over girls (I do to, but it's far to passive), some people get happy over sports.... Blah, blah, blah.  Me?  I get happy over writting.  Typing makes me happy.  Seeing my thoughts transcribed into letters, and seeing that take shape.  It's like gardening.... Or something.    Random topic change.  "Or something" in some class (maybe African Studies) I was in a group, and  I'm talking and ended, and didn't get a response so I says to them says "Ah sumthin'." And I swear they (the group) all nodded.  "Prestigious black man" Mai huun?

      Weekend is over.  Back so slaving my life away.  Work. Work. Work. Sleep. Work. Work. Work. Sleep.  Work. Work. Work. Sex. Sleep. Sex. Work. Work. Work. Work. Die.  Bullshit.  Serious bullshit.  We've created this overly complex "civilized" system, and we're still no better then neandrethals, except the fact we haven't all died off.   This just goes with that beast thing, we're all flawed.  We have this outer layer of neutrality, we could be good or evil, but on the inside we have this desire to undo all progress, despite what our  "Neo-cortex" or some bullshit tells us, our "Reptile brain" is still the thing that affects all our actions the most subtely.  All this crap we put up, is like painting a rotting house.  It'll just barely cover up the problems, but they'll become increasingly worse until the problems become so great, we are already at the point of no return.    Damn.  Okay, Enemies.com, to all my oh so loyal readers, has finally had those sidebars updated.  So now you are "free" to look at a few of the articles Reverend Maximus has up.  The one on Pre-Creation is pretty good, and a few clips of some of his new art are equally nice.

      Writting, writting, writting.  It's always seemed more powerful then talking, I can say stuff I'd never tell people, and none of the stuff has to be direct.  It's just so much better, I remember I was thinking about two different story ideas, although one of them is far more relevant to the now, and it's been burning under the skin in my fingers to be written.  I've never really talked about it for fear of people thinking it applied to me, but it's something more in general.  I know very little about Freud but from what I do understand, he had this thing called the "id" which essentially is the evil part of your personality lurking in the background.  It seems that this is some ancient sort of "reptile brain" lower function to me, but with all the civilization it seems so many of us descend into that part of the brain.  I was thinking of mixing that with Kuandalini-type of serpent fun.  Some guy who's awakened the serpent in himself, but instead of ascending, it descended.  So the guy is being controlled by his Id, and he can do nothing about it?  Except, I never liked the idea of being controlled.  No one is ever controlled to do everything, we all choose to do everything ourselves and I have an obsession with first person.  So this guy, you'd need to feel for him, but at the same time hate him for what he does.... but how?  I really gotta start crackin' on this, but my dad is shrooming.

      Ahlad.  Crazy punk concert today, actually made my day better, although only marginally.  I wouldn't normally consider spending my time in a small room with sweaty underclassman moshing.  Oh well, Samone showed up which would have been an excellante thing, except Chris had bought tickets to some other concert in NYC, and Monie just bounced.  It really sucked, although I stayed a bit longer.  It was about as boring as a Jack and Jill dance is awkward.  So, ehhh....  Silly Monie just bouncing.   Whatever, I wasted the rest of my time hanging out with Zach and Aaron, and we walked around like crazy.   Then we came back, and the more I stood around, the more I was like "Damn, no girls I want to talk to (besides Allie and Co. of course), I better bounce. "  So after talking to Alec, I got a ride home from him, and now I feel like crap, as expected.

      School is driving me into the ground.  At the preschool my depression was different, since the work seemed self inflicted, and had money at the end.  School doesn't have that, it just fills me with an empty feeling at the end of the day, which subsides by the next morning in school and only returns at the end of the day when I realize I have to come back.  Okay, fuck that, straight up.   More interesting things.  Tommorow that weird punk concert is (the grammer is based off of my Chemistry saying today "Glue-all-like").  I normally wouldn't go, considering I have two songs that are rock related on my computer (not counting the other 4 limp bizkit songs), but Samone (Monie?) is going so hey camp friend! Maybe I can convince Allie to come as well, so I don't feel like a total geek (even though I may as well be considering half the shit I listen to is rap).  So I guess that I'm looking forward to that, I really wish I could take some pictures, but alas, I'll need to buy a disposable camera, and will that be easy?  I don't know.  Maybe I can barter some money off of mi mama, para que es un problema porque ella me querara trabajar en la casa y  I don't like trabajar en casa.  Robles was talking about that today..... But whatever, I should leave with some deep analysis of my favorite Nag Hammadi Book.  Light and Darkness, life and death, right and left, are brothers of one another. They are inseparable. Because of this neither are the good good, nor evil evil, nor is life life, nor death death. For this reason each one will dissolve into its earliest origin. But those who are exalted above the world are indissoluble, eternal. -Gospel of Philip  This one is equally disturbing and uplifting at the same time and reflects a HUGE portion of "traditional" , if such a word exist, Christian Gnostic thought IMHO.  This essentially, in reference to the fixation most Christians have with dying, reflects how dying doesn't really gain you much.  Heaven and Hell aren't very far apart, and achieving either one of them is no accomplishment if you can become exalted above that.  Why would you want to worry about Life after Death, when you could simply transcend life-and-death?  Essentially, the entire universe is a circle.  Everything exist within the circle, but there is also  something  outside the Universe.  Even more this then ties into the theme of the world we percieve with our five senses to be a complete lie.

      "Seeing that everybody, gods of the world and mankind, says that nothing existed prior to chaos, I, in distinction to them, shall demonstrate that they are all mistaken, because they are not acquainted with the origin of chaos, nor with its root. Here is the demonstration.   How well it suits all men, on the subject of chaos, to say that it is a kind of darkness! But in fact it comes from a shadow, which has been called by the name 'darkness'. And the shadow comes from a product that has existed since the beginning. It is, moreover, clear that it existed before chaos came into being, and that the latter is posterior to the first product. Let us therefore concern ourselves with the facts of the matter; and furthermore, with the first product, from which chaos was projected. And in this way the truth will be clearly demonstrated. "  -On the Origons of the World

      African (or should I say Afrikan) Studies/History today, was so great.  Gaines got pissed off because no one in the class knew who DuBois was.  I thought it was pretty funny, but not really wanting to show off I kept my mouth shut until Gaines got really pissed and I had to speak up.   I did the same thing for Kush/Nubia when he was talking about it, maybe I have a better grasp on African (aka Afrikan) history then I thought, or else, like Algebra last year, no one else knows shit so I appear to know a lot by comparisson.    I get more and more bothered with who I waste high school with.  I realize it's slightly late in my high school career to make new friends, but each year I usually get stuck around a crowd of people I don't like.  This really does apply to Michael, Idris and Thomas, who I've been friends with before high school, nor the numerous girls I've been friends with before high school.  But this new damn crowd of people I'm wasting my time with just isn't working, I mean, nothing is wrong with them completely, I guess they are all good people in their own right, I just don't fit in with anyone I hang out with and the gap seems to grow day by day.  I mean there is nothing wrong with hanging around a huge amount of white kids (and like five other black guys) but our interest are totally different that's the thing.   Very few of my friends listen to Rap, much less underground/ultra-left wing Rap.  Then add to that the fact I think in an overly philosophical manner I really feel out of touch.  Granted, I'm planning on going to a punk concert Friday, but is my heart really in it?  No, I just want to see a camp friend, that's about it.  I guess this is one of the reason I've been hesistant to go out of the house with anyone, I just feel my interest have moved to far away from everyone elses.    Does anyone else know what I'm trying to communicate?  It just feels like Sophmore year saw me making this huge rift, and it's grown to the point where I can't ignore the rift any longer.  Maybe it's just arrogance, but I really try not to think of myself as being better then anyone, because everyone has a purpose.  So could it just be I'm stressing to much? Could this be the real source of my stress? I assume that only I can truly discover that, but I hate it at the same time.  I can't create a clear path for myself anymore, it's not good enough to just be happy without a reason.  It's not good enough to just be happy being complacent.  Throughout this entire summer, I felt this year would bear "first fruits" (to anyone who understands Kwanzaa) but so far all I am is impatient for that, and it's burning me up.    I don't mean to carry on day-after-day, but I figure I've always been to closed mouth about myself, and I've known it for months.  In the past, I'd rarely have hada  venue to talk, and even if I did, ideas made me happy.  They were important enough to share, then I was joking that was good enough.  But I guess joking is a way of hiding, I love seeing people laugh, and I guess that's the best emotion I can ever think of.  I mean, do you ever get your heart broken laughing?  Has anyone ever commited a horrible crime because they thought someone was funny? I really doubt it.  I'm still ramballing though, and I think I could be getting Carpel-Tunnel in my left wrist, so I better slow it down for now.

      Yes, I did Frandzis via Patrino.  You know who you are out there, my dear Esperantulino.  Anyway.  First monday of school, God damn.  I CAN wait for this event.  Then I've been crapping my pants about homecoming, am I really going to go and would I go alone? With someone? Should I just go senior year and not know what to expect?  School seems to be a bastion of completely un-due stress, that you want to rush through the entire time, but once your through your filled with regrets and significantly older then when you started.  That seems to be how most of life is, you rush through it, and then finally your nearly dead, and wonder where the hell all the time went.  But the time has always been there, you just haven't been paying attention to it.  I guess this is the thing that has depressed people for centuries, not the fact of death being inevitable, but that we unconsciously are racing towards death our entire lives.  Then we get to hung up in the point that we'll die, that we start making up our own lies about it.  Sort of like my favorite quote from the Nag Hammadi   "...God created humanity; [but now human beings] create God. That is the way it is in the world- human beings make gods, and worship their creation. It would be more appropriate for the gods to worship human beings! -Gospel of Phillip 71.35-72.4"  We waste so much time creating our own gods to fear, that we forget that God is actually closer then we think.  Heaven and Hell, life and death shouldn't be such a big concern, because those things that are true "are insoluble, eternal".  To quote the Gospel of Phillip somemore.   I guess this is one of the intentions of formal schooling, to learn lifes hard lessons through depression and struggle.  If school was supposed to make us completely happy, we'd be accepting a lie as the truth, which is far worse then anything else.  That's the thought provoking part of today.   My Uncle is in town yet again, he's been spending time at the recording studio but he dropped by about 9:30 tonight with one of his friends in the music industry, and they and my father went out drinking.  My uncle is still pretty admirable though, anyone who's been that famous and lives that comfortable and doesn't let it get to his head is pretty cool in my book.  He's pretty much stepped down from fame and is just doing what he likes and I can really respect that.

      A lot of thinking.  Two heavy dreams, a new level of understanding.  So much stuff, all in the course of one day.  Mental development comes in waves, not gradually.  The two dreams, are of a rather personal nature, and one of them I've already forgotten.  Then comes yet another thing, which is gossip about certain people, and my observations about them, that'd I'd rather not say at the risk of alienating many of them, if you really want to know ask me in person or online.  Then I've got African Studies, not realizing Juniors usually don't take that class, I'm the only Junior.  Not all that bad all things considered, since I can't be the loudest person in the class since everyone, except for one guy, is black.  For once since my homerooms I'm in a class with mostly black people, how amazing, I can't express how dissappointed this is how the leveling works.  Mr. Gaines is pretty enlightend about it, he believes in letting us place ourselves.  That's the good stuff right there.  But after school I was pissed, depressed, sad, all at the same time.  I still don't know why I accepted a baby sitting job feeling like crap, but at least I got my Pre calc done.  Okay okay.  So that was pretty cool, except the anger and the stress which I couldn't focus on anything.  It was just general stres, and anger, and numerous other bottled up negative emotions I usually push to the side.  To make things better Mrs. S didn't get home until late so I had to deal with little home boy there playing Grand Turismo III for 5+ horas.  Then I get home, and get pissed at my dad for latching the door, because he's to dumb to realize I wasn't home (or at dinner for that matter).  So I kind of blacked on him a bit, then I came downstairs, and I read the Boondocks which made no sense, and somehow felt better knowing I'm a complete and total loser.  Maybe it's because I hate where I am, and realize it's to late to change it.... I really don't know, but I have a feeling I'm gonna need to make things change before I go crazy.

      I was listening to DJ Mr. C on Hot97 last night.  He said the funniest thing, since they can get away with things of that sort on late night radio.  He says "Dale! Say it! Say it! Say 'I'm proud to live with niggers!' Say 'I'm proud to stand on the value with a rag on my head and make the property values drop down.' Say 'I'm proud to drink malt liquor and smoke weed!'" etc.  He went on like that for a few more minutes and I was seriously cracking up, but this was like 11:30 or 12 at night so I was waking my parents up.... Just talking online and that came to my mind.  Thought it should be written down, because I looooove to write every random thought down.  Thoughts have value, you know?

      Gah.  Paris put a new song on his website, but my web is screwed up so I can't DL it currently.  I'm seriously whillin' out over that.  I need his Album, but have to wait an extra 19 days.  On that note! Everyone buy that album, I'll print out 100 flyers if that'd convince two people to buy it, and tell 2 more people to buy it.  It's gonna be the hottest Album of 2003 when it drops.  Seriously.  Remember the name "Sonic Jihad", the media is scared of it!

      First day of school.  Two weird classes in a row, one with a weird new young guy (my math class), who makes himself just seem odd.  The other with a middle aged Castilliano who hates english y habla con un accento... Bleh... El Accento Castilliano no esta buena.  So much lisping! The Lisping and the lisping! It sounds so odd to hear it actually spoken, since I've only read about how it sounds in text books.  It just interrupts the flow of it with the lisp.

      Okay, after my extremely artistic speech about the joys of facial hair, I would have posted something but well.. damn the DSL went out! Then I went to VB, and up until today the internet didn't get fixed.  Whatever, I'm happy with how things are.  My schedule kicks ass (Only 8 periods!) and I have 7th Lunch again (Allah Akbar!).  Not like anyone really cares.  I'm just ramabaling, because I'm a narcissist, or however that crap is spelled.

      Best day in ages.  Me and Asha finally got to hang out away from school, and actually have any bit of fun, that was great.  Great enough to make me really consider my weekend plans, party or the concert?  I just don't know.  But yeah, fun day.    Then Max Payne2 as well.... So much goodness.  It's ironic that I can still have this core of badness eating away at my soul regardless.  Proves a point, that happiness really is relative.  If you have less, it's easier to become happy.

      How is it that whenever I get depressed I fall into the Occult?  I'm back into the heavy Gnostic stuff a bit, which has irked me a bit, until I actually go to church and realize how much I hate hearing the minister always talk about money.  It's the most annoying thing ever.  I guess the wise thing to do would be to read the great works of the Quakers Masters, but you know what?  Hearing about Christians being killed by other Christians in the name of religious freedom is far too odd for it's own good.   Yeah, Asha thing, it's over.  Amazing.  I don't think that's the core of the depression (who knows why I usually get depressed) I think it's more like a number of mental factors combining together in a plethora of wonderfulness.  Yes, SAT word.  I think it's more the cellphone crap, and Allie giving me her crazy version of AZN kill American Sars.  The itching!  I swear, I keeps spreading up and down, and I was worried it'd spread up too far on my leg, you can imagine what would happen with that.  Yeah... Okay it didn't though, it dropped back down to the bend of my knee.  Not that anyone cares about my itchy legs.

      Messengers of Black Cultural Awareness meeting today.  It was pretty good with Bill's presentation.  It really added some perspective to the hardline anti-leveling view.  He brought up some good points, but it was really funny when he mentioned Socialism.  Half the  pendajos   there were like oh yeah.  That's the good stuff.  Haha.  It was pretty great.  But it got out at like damn 5 pm, and I had to walk.  So I got home like 5:40, later then I've ever gotten home walking, but the  vatos  at Seton Hall must really have assumed I was a student there, being there that late.  So it's all good.    The Asha thing, I feel pretty on and off about it.  I really don't know what to feel, probubly the result of "disharmony between my multiple consciousness" or some crazy thing like that, but I'm pretty confused on which road to take.

      If you can actually stand the Bullshit, Peter Carroll is a genius.    "It is easy to see how other people and cultures are the victims of their own beliefs. The horrors of Islam and the ghasty state of politics in sub-Saharan Africa, are obvious examples, but we rarely pause to consider the extent to which we are the victims of our own beliefs, and the ability we have to modify them if we wish.  It is perhaps worth considering the recent history of belief in Western cultures before mounting an attack on the very foundations of the contemporary world view. For about a millenia and a half the existence of "God" was an incontrovertible fact of life in Christendom. It was never questioned or thought to be questionable. Hideous wars and persecutions were conducted to support one interpretation of deity against another. Learned men wrote thousands of books of theoology debating points which seem utterly tedious and idiotic to us now, but the central question of the existence of "God" was never considered. Yet now, the belief in "God" as the author of most of what goes on in the world has been almost competely abandoned, and belief in even the existence of an absentee "God" is in most places fading. Satanism as an anti-religious gesture is now a waste of iconoclastic talent. The alchemists, sorcerers and scientists of the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance won a stupendous posthumous victory. Their questioning of the medieval world view started a rot that brought the whole edifice down eventually.  We can laugh looking back on it now, but I assert that we now live under a collective obsession which is even more powerful and will appear equally limiting and ridiculous to future historians.  Since the eighteenth century European enlightment, a belief has grown to the point where it is now so all-pervasive, and so fundamental a part of the Western world view, that one is generally considered mad if one questions it. This is a belief that has proved so powerful and useful that virtually everyone in the Western world accept it without question. Even those who try to maintain a belief in "God" tend to place more actual faith in this new belief for most practical purposes.  I am about to reveal what this fundamental contemporary belief is. Most of you will think it is so obvious a fact that it can, hardly be called a belief. That, however, is a meassure of its extrordinary power over us. Most of you will think me a madman or a fool to even question it. Few of you will be able to imagine what it would be like not to believe it, or that it would be possible to replace it with something else. Here it is: the dominant belief in all Western Cultures is that this universe runs on material causality and is thus comprehensible to reason. Virtually everyone also maintains a secondary belief that contradicts this - the belief that they have something called free will, although they are unable to specify what this is - but I will deal with that later.  We spend billions every year indoctrinating our young with the primary belief in material causality in our schools. Our language, our logic, and most of our machines, are built largely upon this belief. We regard it as more reliable than "God"." -Carroll

      Funeral today.  I really don't want to elaborate now, because seeing Aunt Susan's corpse still disturbs me, in a way I can hardly explain.  It was beyond tears, it was just a body without a soul/spark of life.  It just seemed so alien, like it wasn't Aunt Susan because it wasn't alive.  See, I'm even reffering to her body like a transcendentalist.... Whoa.  I really gotta sleep, maybe post tommorow.

      Okay, nice Article in the previous entry.    I'm so horribly bored, it's hard for me to even comprehend correctly.  I guess it's because my XBOX is fucked up, and I can't just play "True Crime" for hours on end. I've considered just watching TV, I can't.  I tried playing on the Computer, no fun.  It's just like everything's dried up for me.  Like I have this huge void I need to fill.    Then I also have to hold in stuff.  Wrap it up and hold it in.    At least on the bright side, I saw J Reilly!!! OOOOH shit.  Allie, I have seen the Lord God.  Tim was with him too.  To make things even better I saw little Coltrane, he's the greatest and on the same job related note I saw Jen.  Oh lord.  She was smoking some really weird cigarette.  I never would have guessed she smoked.  But we talked for a hot second, then she drove off in her expensive as hell car.

      Eminem, Racism & Hip-Hop By Davey D,  November 24, 2003   Eminem? Who gives a fuck? Ive always assumed that nigga leaves his lips often behind closed doors anyway - 10-year-old tape or not. Shame on hip-hop for bein suckered by the hype. In general I make it a rule of thumb not to comment on other artists. What we need to focus on instead is the bigger picture. The entire industry now seems to be built on the degradation of black women and the pimping of our culture. The Source is just as guilty of this as Em and a host of others. BET, MTV, Innerscope, Def Jam, Aftermath, So So Def, Murder Inc., Tha Row, Bad Boy, Clear Channel, Viacom - pick one - theyre ALL guilty. All this negative fake gangsta wanna be pimp-Gotti bullshit is as phony as it gets - especially in an industry that supposed to pride itself on keepin it real. Dont focus on what this white boy said when niggas clown black women all of the time. Focus on ALL of these sorry ass artists and the white labels that profit by giving them a voice. -Paris   This morning, I had an opportunity to peep the song by Eminem in which he makes some extremely disparaging remarks about Black women. To say the least, what he said, whether or not he was 16 or 21, as the Source Magazine claims, is indefensible. He should own up to it and apologize.  He should do it, not because Dave Mays, Benzino and The Source are pressuring him. He shouldn't apologize because of all the negative publicity that may erode some of his fan base and market share. He shouldn't apologize because Interscope Records, XXL, Rollingstone, Radio and video outlets that play his music, Dr. Dre and any other person or institution financially connected to Em will be questioned about their judgment or lack thereof. He should apologize because what he said was offensive and hurtful.   And while, I understand, he may have been hurting himself when he made his songs, he still should apologize. As far as I'm concerned Black women deserve to hear that. If Em does do that and he is as sincere and forthcoming with his feelings as he is in his other songs, he will be several steps ahead of a whole lot of people who dis Black women and support the dissing of Black women everyday.   For example, notice, how MTV never apologized for inviting Snoop Dogg to come on their awards show holding sistas strapped to dog leashes. That image was shown all over the world. Nor did MTV apologize for 50 Cent coming on stage with a cadre of real life pimps-which was also shown around the world. Notice how BET never apologized for that offensive stereotypical cartoon Cita? Has Bob Johnson ever apologized for the hours of videos depicting gyrating women who get beer poured on them in videos.   To my knowledge no major radio conglomerate - from Clear Channel to Radio One - has gone on record to publicly apologize for the hours upon hours of music they play that regularly degrades Black women. The words 'Ho' and 'Bitch' - which was once peeped out from songs - is heard so much that it is now left in for all to hear on the record labels official 'radio edits'.   To my knowledge no major radio outlet or video outlet for that matter has apologized for the hours upon hours of airtime they have granted to artists who have inflicted physical abuse upon Black women. We still hear R. Kelly songs, Ike Turner is lauded as a musical genius, and Rick James is a staple on your oldies station. Dr Dre is a Hip Hop icon.   Here in Cali, Sugar Free who candidly admits to his pimping background and makes no bones about returning to the game if need be gets played all the time. Alongside Sugar Free are scores of wanna be pimps ranging from Nick Cannon to Nelly. Pimping sistas is big business in the music biz nowadays and I'm not quite sure which is more offensive, Eminem's racist song or the predominantly white media executives who give the final green light as to what gets played and doesn't get played to the masses via mainstream media outlets.   All I know is that not only is anyone NOT apologizing to sistas, very few are making a concerted effort to curtail this bad behavior or even offer a balanced perspective. I'm still running into artists who are frustrated because their music is being pushed to the side by non-black program and music directors as well as a few black folks who bought into the nonsense that in order to be hip and happening in 2003, you have to be gully and keep your music pimpish. I say we use this situation involving Eminem to end the daily barrage of offensive material depicting Black women.   I'm saying all this because I think its important that we don't lose sight of the bigger picture. Let's not get sidetracked by a discussion around Eminem who basically said what Black artist say everyday in their music. Black women have become 'whores', 'gold diggers', 'bitches' and every other negative stereotype in our entertainment. Lets focus on those powerful folks behind the scenes who call the shots. These are the same media folks who allow a two hour discussion about Eminem, complete with interviews from the Source owners Dave Mays and Benzino and an airing of the song during morning and evening drive time, but will shut the discussion down when the topic turns to questioning our involvement in the war, the Partriot Act, police brutality or the difference in treatment and amount of attention paid to white war hero Jessica Lynch and Black war hero' Soshana Johnson. Heck radio stations in LA that are knee deep in the discussion about Eminem couldnt hold equally compelling discussions when Daz, WC, RBX and numerous other gangsta rappers came together to do an anti-war song. In fact some stations like KKBT instructed their listeners to remove the song from the airwaves.  As we think about some these things, we should also pay close attention to how this plays out and see what sort of double standards emerge. To this day Chuck D and Public Enemy are still getting flack for statements made by Professor Griff over 10 years ago which were deemed anti-semitic. There was never any forgiveness. Cypress Hill saw their records get banned by Bay Area radio stations after one of the members of an opening act to their tour 10 years ago asked a San Francisco audience if they were men or fags. Def Jeff found himself shut out from doing nightclubs when he shouted all the people with aids be quiet!. The list goes on. Will Eminems offensive remarks be overlooked and forgiven? Will radio stations stop playing his songs? Will his videos be banned? If Ems callous remarks from 10 years can be forgiven will we finally forgive Public Enemy or even Jessie Jackson for racially insensitive statements they made 10 and 20 years ago? Will Bill OReilly, who often expresses his concern about the divisive and offensive aspect of rapper's material, lead the charge to boycott Eminem? Will he instruct all those working class viewers to boycott Eminem like he did with Ludacris? We cant have it both ways.   If the issue is really about Em making disparaging remarks about Black women, will all of us in Hip Hop challenge ourselves and demand apologies from every artist who disses Black women? Will we hold their feet to the fire? Will we finally end the mass pimping that dominates the game right now? Better yet, forget the artists - will those of us who can decide what to play or not to play stop playing this offensive material? Maybe its me, but after hearing one on-air discussion about Eminem and his offensive behavior toward Black women, a few minutes later I heard an R. Kelly song. I kept thinking to myself, didnt he pee on an underage black woman in a child porno video?   Something to think about...

      Mad people didn't like today.  I don't know why, I guess I had fun, although I'm mad exhausted.  I don't really feel like writting it all down now, but it was pretty good.  I do feel kind of guilty about talking about myself, likes and dislikes in people, because most people don't actually understand what I'm really like.  I guess that works out well in the end.  I really don't get how I had a cup of espresso and I'm tired as hell.  It had no effect!

      Take this article as you want, but I find the Arab rappers hit pretty close to home so I've been freaking out about that.  With all that good stuff.  But yeah, I guess you could take this as anti- or pro-Zionist (but only one way is right).   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Israeli hip-hop takes on Mideast politics By Joshua Mitnick, Special for USA TODAY  story.news.yahoo.com/news...y/11941611  Thousands of teenagers shrieking at the sight of Israel's hottest pop idol packed a soccer field in this Tel Aviv suburb late this summer, two days after twin suicide bombings killed 15 and wounded dozens.   Wearing baggy sweat pants, a baseball cap pushed off-center and a glittering, rhinestone-studded Star of David necklace, Kobi Shimoni (known by the stage name Subliminal) swaggered on stage as if he were the Israeli incarnation of Eminem (news - web sites). With a booming rhythm track and an Israeli flag draped from the DJ stand, the show turned out to be as much a patriotic pep rally as a rapper's delight.   "Who has an Israeli army dog tag, put your hands in the air!" Subliminal called out in a mix of Hebrew and English. Hundreds of hands shot up. "Who is proud to be a Zionist in the state of Israel, put your hands in the air! Hell yeah!"   The patriotic appeal at the concert won chants of support from the rocking crowd, mostly adolescents grappling with weekly terrorist attacks and a crippling economic recession.   With sidekick Yoav Eliasi (aka The Shadow), Subliminal has parlayed nationalist themes into a chart-topping album, transformed the Star of David into a fashion statement and helped integrate the music of urban America into the fold of Israeli pop.   A voice for teens    For Subliminal, the music has generated tens of thousands of record sales. For Israeli teens, it has given voice to their outrage at the state of affairs in their country. Hip-hop, a quintessentially American art form, is helping bolster national morale in a country bruised by three years of fighting between Israelis and Palestinians.   For most of the past decade, Israeli hip-hop artists operated on the margins of mainstream Israeli music, which has generally been a mix of Hebrew-language rock and Mediterranean crooning. But when hopes for Israeli-Arab peace disintegrated three years ago amid a violent Palestinian uprising, rappers such as Subliminal moved beyond schoolyard party lyrics to rail about the turbulence overwhelming their country.   "Before I started listening to him, I wanted to move to Canada," said Eden Yair, 12. The braces-wearing youngster leaned over a police barrier in hopes of getting a glimpse of the rap star before the show. "We need something that will encourage us. He sings that there's still hope," she said.   Subliminal is not the only Israeli rapper preaching politics. Mook E, whose rap is soaked in reggae phrasing, scored a breakthrough Israeli hit with a song called Talking About Peace. The song bemoans the difficulties of rapprochement while warning about the threat of "fingers on the trigger." A funk outfit whose nonsensical Hebrew name translates to "Snake Fish" predicts the inevitability of a Palestinian state.   Filling a void    Music critics say the hip-hop lyrics have filled a void left by Israel's top pop artists, who have shied away from mixing music and politics for fear of losing their audience.   Hip-hop "made a revolution because before them Israeli music wasn't honest. It was escapist music," says Sagi Bin-Nun, a music writer for the daily Ha'aretz newspaper. "The songs talked in clues, and people hid their honest feelings. People spoke in metaphors." With hip-hop, Israeli rappers get a chance to offer their own narrative of current events, which makes the music a kind of "CNN of the people," Bin-Nun says.   Of the top hip-hop acts, Subliminal's grim prognosis seems most in sync with the nationalistic shift in Israeli sentiment over the years. On the cover of his hit album The Light and the Shadow, an inferno engulfs Subliminal's head. In the song Divide and Conquer, Subliminal and The Shadow sneer at the 1990s peace accords that aspired to create a Palestinian state, and capture the outrage over the violence that erupted three years ago:   To think that an olive branch symbolizes peace.   Sorry, it doesn't live here anymore.   It's been kidnapped, or murdered.      There was peace, my friend.  Handshakes, fake smiles.  Treaties signed in blood.  Where is God?  The angry lyrics and Subliminal's right-wing political convictions have drawn fire from Israeli cultural critics, who call him a militarist and a fascist. Subliminal, whose fluent English is peppered with slang imported from the USA, rejects the labels. He says his songs reflect the daily realities and feelings of Israeli youth.  "In America, hip-hop is the fastest way to get rich, to talk about the 'bitches, cars and money,' " he says. "In Israel the words are very militant, like the situation we're living in. You open the newspaper in the morning in Israel, and this is what you get."  The appeal of hip-hop has crossed the country's ethnic boundaries. Young Israeli Arabs alienated by the Jewish majority glorify African-American rappers as kindred spirits in the struggle against discrimination. Tamer Nafer, an Israeli Arab from the Tel Aviv suburb of Lod, was one of the first to begin rhyming in Arabic after years of listening to Tupac Shakur.   "I said, 'Damn, if we removed the word n- - - and you put (in) the word Arab, it's like singing about us,' " says Nafer, whose hybrid Hebrew and Arabic lyrics challenge Jewish stereotypes of Arabs as terrorists. "It's delivering the message to a younger generation. Politicians don't talk to our generation. But politics is the way of our life, so I'm bringing the way of our life in their language."  With a trio of best-selling albums in the last year and hourly radio play on Israeli pop radio, hip hop has established a beachhead on the local music scene.  Record companies say they've been swamped with demos from artists hoping to become the next Subliminal. But because politics has become an inseparable ingredient of the genre, record executives say they judge new talent on the manifesto as much as the music.  "There's no reason to release an album of hip-hop unless it has something to say. If the artists don't establish an identity, I won't release it," says Gadi Gidor, an artists-and-repertoire executive at Helicon, the label that produced Subliminal's album. "Let's move the debate away from the parliament and onto the streets. If we're not going to say anything, let's go back to Mozart and Bach."   --------------------

      Sonya got mad pissed at me today.  She was like "You smoked Pot?!" and so a conversation ensued.  But seriously, just her getting that pissed.  I was like "Damn, never ever ever again."  So just like pork this is another chapter in the book of life that I'm ending early.  Really, it's a bad idea.  I don't agree with it being illegal, but I don't want to become considered in that verse of "Giants Vs. Giants"  'The drugs, the cocaine, the white man bring, make a brain go insane, and that's another black down the drain' I really do need to look at that.  I remember talking with a guy on the DPZ board who said something about how he's keeping his body and mind pure for "da war" and "da coming stormz".  I thought that was pretty true, maybe I can dig up what he said.

      Video Games are like drugs.  I feel like I'm in another world as long as I'm thinking about video games.  So true for life.  Most people are supressed by something.  Most poor people are kept from revolting because of work being so stressful.  Most of us in school are too involved socially to actually be as serious as we should be scholarly.  It's like humans evolved from things that eat, sleep, and have lots of pointless sex.  We built a building around this primative stuff (called Civilization), and we go to the highest floors, hoping to stay as far away from the stuff at the bottom.  But at the same time, the stuff our civilization is built around, is what we most love.  So strange.

      I think best when I walk alone.  I notice that, I've done it for years but never really written it down.  I guess, that could be considered an advantage of living so far from school, I really get mad time to think.    So I was thinking about sex.  Yes, Marcus isn't completely asexual, so I'm allowed to think about sex.  It's a natural addiction that people have, I guess more of a mental addiction then a physical addiction.  The only problem with it, is that unlike food, which we are born desireing and probubly desire until we die, sex is a desire that comes later, and more unexpected.  Most people can't comprehend it well, because it's not something we're born with and it scares them.  That's why religions are controlling about it.  That's why people are scared to mention it, but really, the desire to have sex is no worse then eating it's just a natural process.  The thing that really makes it bad though, is that's it's largely reflexive.  St.  Augustine, I believe, said that before Adam ate from the tree of knowledge, he had full controll over ALL his appendages.  Which brings up yet another point, but now I'm just ramballing.

      Things I learned on my trip to Syracuse:  1. Road Kill.  Brutal Roadkill is horrifying.  I saw animals with blood and intestines strewn across the highway, and at one point, I saw this huge patch of blood and muscle but no carcass.  2. I need to go to a big University, that melds well with the surrounding city.  After seeing the huge city rise up out of nowhere, and only part of it actually being the college, I was amazed.  3. I can't go to school where it's cold.  Nuf'said.  4. Lauren getting sick in the middle of the night, is not an excuse for me to shit my pants.  If you've been following my life, and know who Lauren is related to, you can understand why I was so panicked when my parents left the hotel at 11:30 at night.  5. Black Liberation is not a game.  It's not.  Syracuse has a horribly depressed Black Community of townies.  The student run paper "The Black Voice" is insane.  I seriously shit my pants a second time when I read it, and it's a weekly so Lauren has to send me them weekly.  It's great stuff.  Especially their seven point program.  I NEED to go to a school with angry black people like that.  Since I can't keep that up forever.  6. Tire tracks are scary as hell.  I saw some skid marks, well I saw alot, but I saw this one pair that scared the shit out of me, and made me glad I didn't have a permit since my father would have made me drive.  These skid marks went from the left lane, all the way to the ditch on the right side of the road.  You knew their was a crash there, but the world had just as soon forgot it.  Scary shit.  Especially because I knew it was a popped tire.

      My life is seriously a spiral towards hell mixed with a tornado.    That what it is.  I have alot, I have nothing, I have alot, I have nothing.  The cycle continues on and on.  So much badness.  That's why leaving town annoys me, it'll just leave the wound open.  I felt vaguely the same on the Boston trip, because I knew it'd not repair the wound.  I don't know.  "Genius of the hole" No matter how high you climb up, you always manage to fall back in deeper.

      SLEIGHT OF MIND IN DEMONOLOGY A surprise addition. "Liber Boomerang"       A god ignored is a demon born.   Think you to hypertrophy some selves at the expense of others?   That which is denied gains power, and seeks strange and unexpected forms of manifestation.   Deny Death and other forms of Suicide will arise.   Deny Sex and bizzarre forms of its expression will torment you.   Deny Love and absurd sentimentalities will disable you.     Deny Aggression only to stare eventually at the bloody Knife in your shaking hand.   Deny honest Fear and Desire only to create senseless neuroticism and avarice.   Deny Laughter and the world laughs at you.   Deny Magic only to become a confused robot, inexplicable even unto yourself.

      Esperanto.  Confusion.    I'm going up to Syracuse tommorow, I really don't want to.  I'm just growing more and more sick of actually having to live with my family.  Whatever.  Life is a prison, and dying doesn't give you any form of release.  It just gives you a fresh new term to serve.  Haha.  Gnostic masters, I love you all.    I'll make some good out of it.  I'll make some good out of this upcoming week as well.  Otherwise I'll go insane.

      Hooo Txeos! Mi vido estas fek!   Seriously, I can see all my problems from far away, but I'm still stuck in my damn body.  It's like how a person feels when they get high, they feel seperate from themselves, like they are greater then their bodies, but at the same time still stuck in it.  That's the story of my life, and I have no clue where it's going.    It's like having a road put in front of you, but it  is completely covered by grass and winds through a forest.  It's like when Sophia descends into the void.  It's like when Jesus was about to be betrayed.  It's like that.  You don't know what the hell is going to happen to you other then it that it'll be something different that'll change you forever.  I don't have any single useful extra-curricular going for me.  So I'm damned to be a fucking Newspaper editor if I want to go for the big league schools.  This is such bullshit.  It's all because Aunt Susan died too.  That's why I've been acting so crazy, and having absolutely NO MORAL COMPASS.  None!    Okay whoa.  I'm not even thinking much now.  This is a late night confessional, and fortunately, I've stepped out of my body and realized that for an instant.  Okay.  Remember what A-tak said.  Hehe.  Best quote ever.  "I don't do... I wasn't doing drugs!" Haha.  She'll kill me, even with my undying love for her.

      Oh man.  Today was semi-fun.  It lost it's cool because I haven't talked to Asha since school.  And I'm plain bored, and want to write something but am far to lazy to write anything of importance on my laptop.  I forgot to retake my Stine test afterschool, so I'm gonna have a B in his class when I could've had an A.  Whatever, I'm not freaking out about it, I'm not looking for an UBER-insane college.  So yeah....  RBG solider.  Smell the Gunsmoke.  I don't know.  I guess I should write on my "hard" journal.  Whatever.  I think everyone needs to read "Thunder:Perfect Mind Again"  I was sent forth from the power,  and I have come to those who reflect upon me,  and I have been found among those who seek after me.  Look upon me, you who reflect upon me,  and you hearers, hear me.  You who are waiting for me, take me to yourselves.  And do not banish me from your sight.  And do not make your voice hate me, nor your hearing.  Do not be ignorant of me anywhere or any time. Be on your guard!  Do not be ignorant of me.   For I am the first and the last.  I am the honored one and the scorned one.  I am the whore and the holy one.  I am the wife and the virgin.  I am and the daughter.  I am the members of my mother.  I am the barren one  and many are her sons.   I am she whose wedding is great,  and I have not taken a husband.  I am the midwife and she who does not bear.  I am the solace of my labor pains.  I am the bride and the bridegroom,  and it is my husband who begot me.   I am the mother of my father  and the sister of my husband  and he is my offspring.  I am the slave of him who prepared me.   I am the ruler of my offspring.  But he is the one who begot me before the time on a birthday.  And he is my offspring in (due) time,  and my power is from him.  I am the staff of his power in his youth,  and he is the rod of my old age.  And whatever he wills happens to me.   I am the silence that is incomprehensible  and the idea whose remembrance is frequent.  I am the voice whose sound is manifold  and the word whose appearance is multiple.  I am the utterance of my name.   Why, you who hate me, do you love me,  and hate those who love me?  You who deny me, confess me,  and you who confess me, deny me.  You who tell the truth about me, lie about me,  and you who have lied about me, tell the truth about me.  You who know me, be ignorant of me,  and those who have not known me, let them know me.   For I am knowledge and ignorance.  I am shame and boldness.  I am shameless; I am ashamed.  I am strength and I am fear.  I am war and peace.  Give heed to me.  I am the one who is disgraced and the great one.   Give heed to my poverty and my wealth.  Do not be arrogant to me when I am cast out upon the earth,  and you will find me in those that are to come.  And do not look upon me on the dung-heap  nor go and leave me cast out,  and you will find me in the kingdoms.  And do not look upon me when I am cast out among those who  are disgraced and in the least places,  nor laugh at me.  And do not cast me out among those who are slain in violence.  But I, I am compassionate and I am cruel.   Be on your guard!  Do not hate my obedience  and do not love my self-control.  In my weakness, do not forsake me,  and do not be afraid of my power.  For why do you despise my fear  and curse my pride?  But I am she who exists in all fears  and strength in trembling.  I am she who is weak,  and I am well in a pleasant place.  I am senseless and I am wise.   Why have you hated me in your counsels?  For I shall be silent among those who are silent,  and I shall appear and speak,  Why then have you hated me, you Greeks?  Because I am a barbarian among the barbarians?  For I am the wisdom of the Greeks  and the knowledge of the barbarians.   I am the judgement of the Greeks and of the barbarians.  I am the one whose image is great in Egypt  and the one who has no image among the barbarians.  I am the one who has been hated everywhere  and who has been loved everywhere.  I am the one whom they call Life,  and you have called Death.   I am the one whom they call Law,  and you have called Lawlessness.  I am the one whom you have pursued,  and I am the one whom you have seized.  I am the one whom you have scattered,  and you have gathered me together.  I am the one before whom you have been ashamed,  and you have been shameless to me.  I am she who does not keep festival,  and I am she whose festivals are many.   I, I am godless,  and I am the one whose God is great.  I am the one whom you have reflected upon,  and you have scorned me.  I am unlearned,  and they learn from me.  I am the one that you have despised,  and you reflect upon me.   I am the one whom you have hidden from,  and you appear to me.  But whenever you hide yourselves,  I myself will appear.  For whenever you appear,  I myself will hide from you.  Those who have [...] to it [...] senselessly [...].   Take me [... understanding] from grief.  and take me to yourselves from understanding and grief.  And take me to yourselves from places that are ugly and in ruin,  and rob from those which are good even though in ugliness.  Out of shame, take me to yourselves shamelessly;  and out of shamelessness and shame,  upbraid my members in yourselves.   And come forward to me, you who know me  and you who know my members,  and establish the great ones among the small first creatures.  Come forward to childhood,  and do not despise it because it is small and it is little.  And do not turn away greatnesses in some parts from the smallnesses,  for the smallnesses are known from the greatnesses.   Why do you curse me and honor me?  You have wounded and you have had mercy.  Do not separate me from the first ones whom you have known.  And do not cast anyone out nor turn anyone away  [...] turn you away and [... know] him not.  [...].  What is mine [...].  I know the first ones and those after them know me.   But I am the mind of [...] and the rest of [...].  I am the knowledge of my inquiry,  and the finding of those who seek after me,  and the command of those who ask of me,  and the power of the powers in my knowledge  of the angels, who have been sent at my word,  and of gods in their seasons by my counsel,  and of spirits of every man who exists with me,  and of women who dwell within me.  I am the one who is honored, and who is praised,  and who is despised scornfully.  I am peace,  and war has come because of me.  And I am an alien and a citizen.  I am the substance and the one who has no substance.   Those who are without association with me are ignorant of me,  and those who are in my substance are the ones who know me.  Those who are close to me have been ignorant of me,  and those who are far away from me are the ones who have known me.  On the day when I am close to you, you are far away from me,  and on the day when I am far away from you, I am close to you.   [I am ...] within.  [I am ...] of the natures.  I am [...] of the creation of the spirits.  [...] request of the souls.  I am control and the uncontrollable.  I am the union and the dissolution.  I am the abiding and I am the dissolution.  I am the one below,  and they come up to me.   I am the judgment and the acquittal.  I, I am sinless,  and the root of sin derives from me.  I am lust in (outward) appearance,  and interior self-control exists within me.  I am the hearing which is attainable to everyone  and the speech which cannot be grasped.  I am a mute who does not speak,  and great is my multitude of words.   Hear me in gentleness, and learn of me in roughness.  I am she who cries out,  and I am cast forth upon the face of the earth.  I prepare the bread and my mind within.  I am the knowledge of my name.  I am the one who cries out,  and I listen.  I appear and [...] walk in [...] seal of my [...].  I am [...] the defense [...].  I am the one who is called Truth  and iniquity [...].   You honor me [...] and you whisper against me.  You who are vanquished, judge them (who vanquish you)  before they give judgment against you,  because the judge and partiality exist in you.  If you are condemned by this one, who will acquit you?  Or, if you are acquitted by him, who will be able to detain you?  For what is inside of you is what is outside of you,  and the one who fashions you on the outside  is the one who shaped the inside of you.  And what you see outside of you, you see inside of you;  it is visible and it is your garment.   Hear me, you hearers  and learn of my words, you who know me.  I am the hearing that is attainable to everything;  I am the speech that cannot be grasped.  I am the name of the sound  and the sound of the name.  I am the sign of the letter  and the designation of the division.   And I [...].  (3 lines missing)  [...] light [...].  [...] hearers [...] to you  [...] the great power.  And [...] will not move the name.  [...] to the one who created me.  And I will speak his name.   Look then at his words  and all the writings which have been completed.  Give heed then, you hearers  and you also, the angels and those who have been sent,  and you spirits who have arisen from the dead.  For I am the one who alone exists,  and I have no one who will judge me.   For many are the pleasant forms which exist in numerous sins,  and incontinencies,  and disgraceful passions,  and fleeting pleasures,  which (men) embrace until they become sober  and go up to their resting place.  And they will find me there,  and they will live,  and they will not die again.

      Funny stuff.  I dressed up in a Jersey and some weird baggy shirt, and I answered the door for halloween (actually I also had a black bandana on) and some kids from Newark (I guess since they looked old enough to be in High School and I'd never seen them around) asked if I was a blood, and if I was wearing a throwback.  Wow.  Remind me never to dress up in crazy hip-hop clothes again.  Please, remind me.  No talking to Asha this weekend.  I think her parents were pissed at her or something.  So sad.  So sad.  And Degrassi this weekend.  Holy Madre de Dios in Heaven.  It was crazy, Craig has a falling out with Ashley (they were gonna have Sex, but Ash is bipolar) so he ends up screwing with Manny in his garage (not litterally screwing) but you get the point.  Haha, and Allie was concerned about my Jamaican weed comment.  I'll make everyone aware, that I've never smoked Jamaican weed, or for that matter anything from Jamaica.

      Tuesday, December 30, 2003 more on lifestylism A new wrinkle in the lifestyle politics discussion: Greg drops a line and extends this to some of the trends we see in communities of color, too:  Gangsterism and criminality: You don't have to sell crack, strong arm old people, pimp your sister, beat up your momma, and shoot folks you barely know (for fun and 'props') to survive. Even worse are the POC in the 'burbs (and their wigger homies) who do all the above, minus the gunplay.  Afrocentricism/cultural nationalism: Just 'cause you don't eat pork, pray to an invisible mystery spook besides Jesus whose name most cannot pronounce (or you pray to a black Jesus), or you only eat itals doesn't make you a sufferah, a rasta, a muslim, or a revolutionary.  Buying "black", "La Raza", etc; I've been buying black for a long time, for some things I still do, yet I am no freer; neither are the folks I buy from. It feels good, looks good, but still we live in bigger cages with longer chains. The only real affirmative action is that you will do more time if your skin is dark. And god help you if you're from another country.  posted by ernesto @ 8:43 PM Monday, December 29, 2003 more on complacency politics Since I threw down the 25 Deciembre comments on lifestyle politics, I've had numerous intriguing messages, interactions and comments. I wanted to sum up and elaborate on a few points.  The fault of lifestyle politics, I just wrote, is that it dumbs down political action to what's small, easy or convenient. It also assumes people are inherently stupid, lazy and middle class. The lifestylist approach becomes an end unto itself; one where action starts at not buying a given product, and eventually ends there, because it's assumed that lifestylism (anything from boycotting X-store to using granola soaps) is where people have to start, with no coherent strategy for building beyond it. Lifestylism is complacency politics, and I am no doubt pointing out the obvious.  Angus, who's got a mad nice site here mentioned that he met a person who used the term "food liberals" to describe this affliction. Can I get a witness?  Just so it's out there, I'm not writing about anyone in particular, save the white male who wanted to lecture me about Colombians (and I got a few irritated white folks complaining about me pointing out his race, which is another commentary someday). I post these things for people of color to think about our objective conditions and what it will take to win our liberation. To be truthful, I expect most white activists to be into lifestyle politics, because many are privileged enough where to drink or not drink Coke is a major personal decision (contrast with miseducation of one's people's history, one's family members going to the pen because of racist cops, and denial of land). However, I expect people of color to be more critical, because our survival depends on it. Too many of us who link in with the white left accept mental colonialism happily. We need to think outside of dominant-culture conventions. Lord knows it's gotten the white left nowhere in the last 30 years.  posted by ernesto @ 11:07 PM

      Black people overload.    Okay, I can deal with James and Gennine, their dash of West Orange collaquialism is fine, but when I have to then try and interpret the parlance of my 20ish year old cousins as well it gets most frustrating.  Add in the stress of the twang of a Southern member of my family and the confusion only grows.  The nuances of this were further exacerabted on Christmas day.  Since my dearest Aunt Susan has, regrettablly, passed away, my wisest goodest grandmother dictated that we shant fret because our annually (in accordance with the sun and the good calendar of our lord and savior) held brunch would still convene.  The symposium was brief, and members in attendance were similar as the previous eve.  The addition were two aquaintances of my dearest goodest grandmother, both of whom added their southern vernacular to the linguistic soup around the table.     At this time, going home my current mental state was quite nebulous, so to further aggravate this state of affairs we traveled to Dover, to see my wonderful distant cousins new abode.   I wasn't feeling loquacious in any form, so instead I sat watching television (a game of hoops naturally) and feeling the resonance of those around. I finally was summoned to the central eating chamber, and networked with my great uncle (being that he is the brother of my fathers mother) about the things that had transpired in the year of which I still hold residence.  These effects percipated a great mental change in me this morning.  After promptly waking up to find my house abandoned, I walked to the room in which my family holds cooking in common.  Not wishing for any commercialized type of ceral, I pulled out a few frozen together patties, and rapidly changed their internal temperature via a heating apparatus.  Afterwards, I percieved a contained aptly containing dried cornmeal.  I added water to a small portion, and proceded to heat it until it turned to a thick paste, at which point I ate it.  This was my current day, up until now.

      I'm back.  I saw Bamboozled in the Library on Monday.  It gets more interesting every time I see it.  It also worked perfectly with me having done the dumb thing of reading "African World Revolution" that is the one book that could actually pull me away from Socialism if I read it in one sitting.  Speaking of which, Thomas showed me a "Bloomcounty" which bothered me.  It was talking about how "Ebony" is an all black magazine, and that if a similar all white magazine existed it'd be labelled racist.  The same problem comes up on the egroup I am part of "Anarchist People of Color".  People seem to think that the minority can't have it's own groups, but being in the majority means the minority can't be stretched thin enough to be included... If that makes any sense.  This may continue on.  I've tended to notice, especially after Bamboozled a pretty bothering trend.  Michael Rappaport, the CEO of CNS in the Movie, says "Nigga, nigga, nigga, I don't care what Spike Lee says, I agree with Tarantino, it's just a word."  I let that sink in, and that general speech that followed.  I can't really put it into words, because my opinion is strongly lacking.  I tend to notice people laugh at me when I say I want to be a teacher of elementry school.  Most people consider that a "low job" only fit for women and gay men (I wasn't gay last time I saw a naked guy, then again the last naked guy I saw was myself).  This is clearly horseshit, and is a serious problem.  Mrs. Skeete (should I say Doctor Wise) was saying that she had a program in Patterson trying to get students to return to the district as teachers because their is a huge lack.  Going to Newark, I tend to see this, especially with the blonde hair, blue-eyed, Aryan principal at McKinney (or whatever the hell it was called).  That really explains alot, that means these kids have their brains completely reduced to mush at a young age especially the males, and especially the males who don't have fathers.  The only black men they are gonna see are on the streets (which usually means that's another black down the drain), on Television (I hate tv as a rule), or as the damn janitor.  Please tell me you see the problem.  Then you have white teachers, who are mostly women, bearing down on these children trying to give them education.  The first effect is that these people are foreign if the area your from is mostly black, and  Mestizos .  So you've got Black guys who see white women as the smartest people in the world from a young age.  So that means even if they get educated, they aren't going to see black girls as worthy.  Then you have black girls who seeing how smart their wonderful white teacher is, figure they can't get a smart black guy because he'll want the smart black girl, so they end up with some trashy ass wanna-be thug.  I can even see that at Columbia, please tell me someone else is bothered by girls who settle for less.  This is one of the reason I feel a need to be a teacher.  Although I generally consider working for the government a bad thing, I tend to have marginally more faith in local government.    Okay, my fingers want me to type more.  I usually don't confront people on this, I've only done it twice.  People generally say, "Marcus, your so white."  What the hell does that mean?  If you can find a definition that shows that our country hasn't diluted your mind with racism please, tell me.  The way I see it is, because I don't follow anything of what's shown on tv, and I act more how I choose (well I guess I do appear to fit in a certain niche),  then I'm suddenly "not down".    Wow.  I guess I usually never say something because I'm comfortable with my identity.  Gangs.  This is a key issue in our community that really pisses me off.  It's some fantastical bullshit.  We have the wonders of white flight playing out fullswing in the High School, and suddenly when black people start doing funny handshakes, or acting like thugs then suddenly we have a gang problem.  What the hell does the gang do? Steal cars? Nope.  Sell drugs? No, other people already have that market.  Then what the hell do they do?  Even more then that, this issue of gangs seems to be playing into alot of fights.  Nia tells me about the same thing in middle school, and fortunately the rage she feels from seeing black people always fighting each other has surfaced.  I can agree. Nothing pains me more then seeing black people physically fight each other.  It says something, since I can expect to see some form of a fight everyday at lunch or hear about the aftermath of one.  Who sees this?  Who forms opinions about this?  What does that say you think about yourself?  Fuck game.  I'm sick of typing.

      Bush Signs Bill Extending FBI Powers   Associated Press   WASHINGTON -- President Bush has signed legislation making it easier for FBI agents investigating terrorism to demand financial records from casinos, car dealerships, and other businesses.   The changes were included in a bill authorizing 2004 intelligence programs. Most of the details of the bill are secret, including the total cost of the programs, which are estimated to be about $40 billion. That would be slightly more than Bush had requested.   Bush signed the bill Saturday, the White House announced.   The bill expands the number of businesses from which the FBI and other US authorities conducting intelligence work can demand financial records without seeking court approval.   Under current law, "national security letters" can be issued to traditional financial institutions, such as banks and credit unions, to require them to turn over information. The bill expands the definition of financial institution to include other businesses that deal with large amounts of cash.   Supporters of the change say it will help authorities identify money laundering and other activities that fund terrorism. But some lawmakers and civil liberties advocates say the change does not provide enough safeguards to ensure that authorities will not violate the privacy of innocent people.   In other provisions, the bill:   Requires the CIA director to prepare a report as soon as possible on what intelligence agencies have learned from their experiences in Iraq.   Creates a Treasury Department office to work with intelligence agencies on fighting terrorist financing.   Creates pilot programs to share raw data between agencies.   Authorizes agencies to continue research on computerized terrorism surveillance suspended by the Pentagon.

      Got home.  Watched "Jackie Brown".  Pam Grier, even in her 40's is one of the best looking women I'll ever see in my life.  I'm going to go watch some of her blacksploitation movies.  Oh man.  Fun stuff.  Dreams.  I'm the only person who get's pissed when they wake up and realized they forgot what they dreamt about.  It causes me the worst type of stress, but if I do remember my dreams I'm set for the day.  Weird stuff.

      Black On Black Violence - Real Talk By Paris,  December 6, 2003   What is it with us? Why do we kill each other at a rate thats disproportionately higher than that of other people? Sure, weve heard the excuses before - that were prone to crime, violent by nature and poor and oppressed - but what are the real causes?   Here we are, in 2003, countless articles & news reports later, and our precious communities are still in a state of distress. It seems the problem of black on black crime doesnt seem to be improving, but rather steadily getting worse by the day. But whats really going on?   Its apparent to this observant eye that more often than not were acting out the way were expected to act -- that is, fulfiling a role in society that has been decided upon and encouraged by people other than us. All we need to do is look at the television or listen to the radio to experience the sobering statistics or the self-hating bullshit that now passes as black entertainment on the evidently racist major networks to confirm this fact. Thuggishness and gangsterism, misogyny, brutality and ignorance have become synonymous with black life in the eyes of many, both inside and outside of our communities, as a result of both our actions and of corporate Amerikkkas sanctioning and glorification of negative imagery and behavior. Our worst attributes are always awarded, paraded and celebrated by those whose job it is to keep us in a state of distress. Harsh, you say? Hardly. Fear of non-whites is big business in Amerikkka, and shows like COPS and virtually any news broadcast aid in the manifestation of that fear and the acceptance of its remedies - increased police presence, new prison construction and the passage of tougher laws. Besides, do you think black life really matters to them? That they care if we kill each other off?   Understand that our focus and priorities need to change, and that nobody can be relied upon to care about us but us. This should be obvious to all of us by now. Things that many of us seem too often to be concerned with (game, pimpin, the life, etc.) are of little importance to others. So let me say it for the record - fuck game. Do you think the bank, the phone company or a prospective employer care about game? Care about pimpin? Life goes on without it. And while game may make you cute in the eyes of shallow folks, nowadays what you know is more important than how you look or act. Contrary to popular belief, nigga-slick is out of fashion. Only through education and hard work will we move beyond simply surviving to success.   But back to the point. While the violence we see and hear on TV, films, and in black music remains a contributing factor that keeps us on our self-destructive path, it is by no means the sole reason. Many of us have a pent-up rage that easily triggers aggression -- aggression that often results from a combustible blend of cultural and racial baggage that many of us carry.   What we need to do now is break out of the mold of acting out in ways expected of us. Angry black men without focus arent a threat to anyone but themselves, and have become the targets of ridicule by those outside of our communities. Again, who cares if we kill each other off? We must care.   It can be argued that black life is viewed by many as being worthless, and it should come as no surprise that many studies have confirmed that the punishment blacks receive when the victims of violent crime are white is far more severe than if the victims are black. Add to this the lack of opportunity, sense of deprivation, powerlessness and alienation that many of us experience since birth and the picture becomes all-too-clear -- that society is not set up for our benefit. We have to make our own way, and in order to get there we must first respect ourselves and each other. Easier said than done, you say? Why? Everything is easier when we get along, especially since it appears that many others dont want us to. The name of the game now is to be focused. Stay focused on not only the present, but on your future too. How many young folks today cant envision themselves older than 25? How many plan for the future at all?   The devaluation of black life by systematic racism and the media has encouraged many of us to have disrespect for life and to act out our aggressions onto others -- often with the victims being women and other black males. When this happens, we all lose.   And what about gangs and drugs? The introduction of crack cocaine by the CIA into our communities during the 1980's made black youth gangs bigger and more dangerous than they had ever been before. The illicit profits of drug trafficking provided, and continues to provide, vicious incentives for those of us without direction, immediate opportunity or hope to murder ourselves. In fact, much of the recent escalation in the murder rates can be directly traced to busted drug deals, competition over markets, disputes over turf and bruised egos.   So what must we do? We must take responsibility, first and foremost, for both ourselves as individuals and as a collective. We must understand that our brothers and sisters are not our enemies. Again, we have no one to look out for us but us. When you see wrong, speak on it. Intervene. Reach out to your friends and family if they are at risk, and be receptive to other peoples points of view if you are feeling like violence is your only alternative. You might just save your life or the life of someone you know.

      I really shouldn't be writting this stuff down for just anyone to read.  But whatever.  My two current goals (like my Froshie goals of Learning to nasema Kiswahili wa Atakalam Arabiiyah bi-talaqah, or my Sophmore goal of becoming a complete and total Socialist revolutionary) are to- Firstly, be able to have control of my dreams.  Secondly, to be able to astrally project (Out of Body Experience).  Internal, but they have practical applications to reality, and I believe enough people have talked about them for me to think them real.  Lot of effort though.  School.  Ick.

      So I thought about it.  Magic crap is generally BS, and even if it existed, I don't see much of a reason to pursue anything that leads to external power, when I can't even understand my own mind yet.  So you know.  I figure, I'll just work on my dreams, and psyche all the stuff that's important.  If I can understand that, what the hell can't I understand.  I started my dream journal.  Cleared out my closet, to give myself some freespace.  Then I updated my other writtings.  I'm thinking, maybe I can change my other story.  I forget the name.  But it really had a lot of potential if it was more grounded in reality.

      Mind you, I don't actually believe this.  But then again, it's Chaos, why would anyone believe it?  Nothing is true.  Everything is permitted.  This is about the difference between religious thinking, and materialist thinking.  It essentially tries to find problems with both "Atheism" and "Theism", and shows why neither have much grounding.  "Transcendental philosophies are basically religious and manifest in a spectrum stretching from the fringes of primitive spirits through pagan polytheism to the monotheism of the Judaeo-Christian- Islamic traditions and the theoretical non-theistic systems of Buddhism and Taoism. In each case it is believed that some form of consciousness or spirit created and maintains the universe and that human, other living organisms, contain some fragment of this consciousness or spirit, which underlies the veil, or illusion of matter. The essence of Transcendentalism is belief in spiritual beings greater than oneself or states of spiritual being superior to that which currently one enjoys. Earthly life is frequently seen merely as a form of dialogue between oneself and one's deity or deities, or perhaps some impersonal form of higher force. The material world is a theatre for the spirit or soul or consciousness that created it. Spirit is the ultimate reality to the transcendentalist.     In the Materialist paradigm the universe is believed to consist fundamentally and entirely of matter. Energy is but a form of matter and together they subtend space and time within which all change occurs strictly on the basis of cause and effect. Human behaviour is reducible to biology, biology is reducible to chemistry, chemistry is reducible to physics and physics is reducible to mathematics. Mind and consciousness are thus merely electrochemical events in the brain and spirit is a word without objective content. The causes of some events are likely to remain obscure perhaps indefinitely, but there is an underlying faith that sufficient material cause must exist for any event. All human acts can be categorized as serving some biological need or as expressions of previously applied conditioning or merely as malfunction. The goal of materialist who eschews suicide is the pursuit of personal satisfaction including altruistic satisfactions if desired. "  -Liber Kaos

      I was going to Thomas' house yesterday, and Mike drives by me.  I was like "Holy crap!", so he comes back around and gave me a ride to Tom's.  It was some good stuff.  It almost, but doesn't, make me feel bad about not getting my permit yet, but fortunately, my extreme mental prowess allows me to rationalize the fact that all I'll be doing until August is working a few blocks from where I live, or going to school.  So, I'm waiting until February break to get my Permit.  That's like three weeks.  So anyway.  Swim meet today.  I sucked, and I have overly high standards for myself, which makes me feel even worse.  I swam the five hundred today, which is 20 laps to those who don't know swimming, and sucked.  I came in last by like 30seconds to a minute.  Whatever.  I've been going uphill this year, so I guess I can redeem myself.  And school.  I don't like school.  I want to run away to the foreign land of LA, and work in Stephen Hoellers church and learn the ways of Orthodox Gnositicism from him.  Hell, maybe I could run away to a Thelemic enclave and learn Thelema.  The sky's the limit.

      Now here comes the stuff I don't usually talk about.  I was walking home today, and it was friggin' cold.  It saw Abby walking by, infact we almost walked into each other a corner and we both talked about our fear of the evil history exam, while we both stood shivering.  It's funny how when we were talking, it's like we both wanted to just nod and walk away, but you need to formally break off a conversation.  Funny.  Even more funny, which I realized when I was walking away, is that I was crazy over Abby last year.  Like I really didn't advertise that, but oh man, it was insanity stuff.  Today, I thought about that, before I got into actual crazy relationship crap this year, Sophmore year was all like "I wish I had a girlfriend." and I was all happy despite that since I didn't really have any person I needed to worry about besides myself.  This year, I'm just getting fucked up, to put it nice and square.  Zack was smoking today, and I swear, I inhaled so much of his clove smoke I may as well have lit up a clove myself.  I mean, jeez, I'm getting myself messed up in too short a span of time.

      Yet another excerpt from the Great and Holy Principia Discordia:  Some excerpts from an interview with Malaclypse the Younger by THE GREATER METROPOLITAN YORBA LINDA HERALD-NEWS-SUN-TRIBUNE-JOURNAL-DISPATCH-POST AND SAN FRANCISCO DISCORDIAN SOCIETY CABAL BULLETIN AND INTERGALACTIC REPORT & POPE POOP. GREATER POOP: Are you really serious or what? MAL-2: Sometimes I take humor seriously. Sometimes I take seriousness humorously. Either way it is irrelevant.  GP: Maybe you are just crazy. M2: Indeed! But do not reject these teaching as false because I am crazy. The reason that I am crazy is because they are true.  GP: Is Eris true? M2: Everything is true. GP: Even false things? M2: Even false things are true. GP: How can that be? M2: I don't know man, I didn't do it.  GP: Why do you deal with so many negatives? M2: To dissolve them. GP: Will you develop that point? M2: No.  GP: Is there an essential meaning behind POEE? M2: There is a Zen Story about a student who asked a Master to explain the meaning of Buddhism. The Master's reply was "Three pounds of flax." GP: Is that the answer to my question? M2: No, of course not. That is just illustrative. The answer to your question is FIVE TONS OF FLAX!

      I'm really an idiot.  I'll do the oddest stuff simply because I can.  I guess it could be an affect of those "gosh darn rebellious teenage years" but I'm starting to wonder.  Like today, during 9th period we were going to the Pizza shop, and Zack was smoking cloves.  So he says "Hey, you want one?" and I'm thinking "Well... I have a swim meet today...."  but nooooo....  So I say, "I'll just take a hit."  Now, this is one of the only smart things I learned in Health class about smoking.  Your not supposed to gulp smoke, this isn't a drug that's supposed to mess you up.  So I just took the smoke into my mouth, let it sit for a second and blew out.  It honestly wasn't much of anything, and it has a dull aftertaste which is similar to how it smells (cloves do smell better then cigs).  I do have to admit it was fun blowing the smoke out, and Zack spent most of his time messing around with blowing the smoke out.  So, lesson?  Don't smoke.  I've essentially proven that to myself completely.  It has absolutely not advantages to it.  I was hearing some people talk about smoking later, and they said the craving never goes away either.  So, me, I'm like "Glad I don't smoke." haha.  Yeah.  So take my advice, and if you get too curious don't bring the smoke into your lungs, just keep it in your mouth.    Thomas says I experiment with drugs to much.  Not true, haha.

      From the most Holy "Principia Discordia"  The PENTABARF was discovered by the hermit Apostle Zarathud in the Fifth Year of The Caterpillar. He found them carved in gilded stone, while building a sun deck for his cave, but their import was lost for they were written in a mysterious cypher. However, after 10 weeks & 11 hours of intensive scrutiny he discerned that the message could be read by standing on his head and viewing it upside down.  KNOW YE THIS O MAN OF FAITH!  I - There is no Goddess but Goddess and She is Your Goddess. There is no Erisian Movement but The Erisian Movement and it is The Erisian Movement. And every Golden Apple Corps is the beloved home of a Golden Worm. II - A Discordian Shall Always use the Official Discordian Document Numbering System.  III - A Discordian is Required during his early Illumination to Go Off Alone & Partake Joyously of a Hot Dog on a Friday; this Devotive Ceremony to Remonstrate against the popular Paganisms of the Day: of Catholic Christendom (no meat on Friday), of Judaism (no meat of Pork), of Hindic Peoples (no meat of Beef), of Buddhists (no meat of animal), and of Discordians (no Hot Dog Buns).  IV - A Discordian shall Partake of No Hot Dog Buns, for Such was the Solace of Our Goddess when She was Confronted with The Original Snub.  V - A Discordian is Prohibited of Believing what he reads.

      Very scary thought I just had.  I've been changed.  I've had some aliens remove my mind as it was copy it, and alter it to be loyal to them.  It explains everything, and makes me realize how fragile "being you" actually is.  I mean, what does "you" count as?

      Hyperventilating until you pass out has some pretty healing effects on the mind, most people don't realize.   It seems dangerous, but that's not the point.  When you black out like that, your memory just goes off, and it's like a million years pass in some abstract realm of free thought and then bam! your suddenly back in your body.  The thing is when you wake up, whatever the hell just happened makes you laugh.  For no real reason you just laugh, and then try and go about your day like normal.  Crazy?  Possible.  I was sitting here, and then suddenly something occured to me.  "Holy Shit, the world is actually moving right now!" It's more profound then I thought.  I was reading Laura's blog, and she was talking about her boyfriend, and I just felt like "Damn.  Other people." I really can't explain what the hell that means short of that now I've gone back into my occultic shell that I retreat into when I'm depressed.

      Allie begged me for an update.  I love it when girls beg.  Mwahahaha.    Disclaimer-  No Kelly and No Asha it's not like that.  I was re-reading Neuromancer, and holy crap.  That book is pretty crazy when you actually think about some of the stuff that goes on.  Especially how the main character subjects some people to police brutality, and how clipped peoples emotions are towards things.    After re-reading that, I've decided weird books are the best.  So hopefully, tommorow, I'll go to the Library and get "Snow Crash" (which I learned about via the Library Website).  A book about a guy who works for the Mafia controlled Pizza Delivery Chain "La Cosa Nostra" and is the best Sword Fighter in the World, while also being one of the best people in the Matrix.  I mean, that seems normal enough.  Shrimp.  It's been a contest between that and Toaster Struddles.  I think I've decided that Toaster Struddles win.  I guess I decided that at legal sea food yesterday....   BRINE SHRIMP.   Okay, I'm better.  But sea food in general is weird, but anything for daddy dearest birthday.   Una otra punto de vista  Dad bought the other two boondocks books but being who he is he has hoarded them.  Weirdo.    I really wish I could write like Gibson, or R. A. Wilson.  But alas, I don't have the white people writting powers.  So, I guess I'll have to settle for those African writers like umm... Achebe and that guy who wrote "Wretched of the Earth".

      Counties were today for swimming.    I only choose to swim one event, 100 Breastroke (or is it two words?), I didn't realize up until this year how horrible my time would be for the start of the season.  It was a whopping 2:06.  To give you an idea of how bad that is, Justin (the best Breast swimmer in the county) has 1:03.  So, I was pretty nervous since I was stacked against people who were better then me.  Naturally, my Nubian powers helped, I used my pent up black rage and was able to get ahead at the start.  But being me, I've only done about four or so single events in two years (the rest were relays) so I was shocked at how quiet the pool was, either I was ahead of all these people of I had false started.  I began to panic even as I swam.  So, I convinced myself that something must be wrong, and as I did my open-turn, I stopped (foot touched the bottom) to glance down the pool.  Shit.  I would have been ahead if I hadn't flinched, I lost the lead, and had to swim like a crazy Neolithic farmer to try and gain the lead back.  I got a time of 1:40 or was it 1:38, which is almost thirty seconds better.  But sadly, I got disqualified, which I figured.  It was a learning experience though, because I never felt what it was like to be in the front, and now I know not to panic.  Crap, I'm still shaking.  I've also, been really debating with picking up some heavy ancestor worship, although I don't know how I'd get started with it.

      I was reading, something I normally do, and came to an interesting conclusion that ironically gave me a fair amount of religious insight.  Kwanzaa, isn't normally religious in nature, it's far more spiritual.  I was reading an article on belief.net, and it suggested something even greater.  It did mention how Kwanzaa held many socially uplifting beliefs, but at the same time, it promotes ancestor worship very subtlely.  I can't remember the exact words, but their is a point (in formal Kwanzaa precedings) where you pass around a "Unity Cup" (I forget all the proper terms), and you take a drink from it (usually symbolically) sort of like offering libaitions, you speak the name of someone who died, and everyone says "Harambe" (I forget the meaning).  It's a way to connect people back with their ancestors, and in a way maintain a fair amount of culture.    Why am I saying this of course?  Well the scariest teacher, Mrs. Cooper, is Yoruba (the religion).  It shares alot in common with Santeria (as most Caribbean Hispanics call it)/Voodoo/Obeah (Jamaica, and British West Indies)/Candomble (Brazil) what ever else you want to call it.  Well, Mrs. Cooper, at least I got the sense, has the sort of gaze of a Mambo (don't even try to keep up with me) that a typical person in Haiti is taught to avoid.  I swear, randomly in the hall, I looked at her, she looked at me, and seriously, her eyes have been burned into my mind.  It was the creepiest gaze, like it had power or something.  So all I can think about is Yoruba, or things related to African "traditional" religion.

      www.urbandictionary.com is a site created by some guy who wanted to allow the definitions of slang words into his dictionary.  He doesn't add any, random visitors will come, and add their definitions of words.  It's similar to raisethefist.com in it's decentralized nature but without the redeeming values.  Granted, a white man has a right to own the site 'urban dictionary' and he even has the right to pronounce Kelis wrong (he used a soft 'i') and call her a rapper (since all black music is rap).  But he let's people post some serious trash, that he doesn't bother to delete.  I was more horrified when I found out that many people agreed with the persons definition.  So here is what I'm fuming about.  NAACP  National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.  They do more harm than good.  Not everything has to be a racist issue.  "The NAACP is always causing problems,  this is why we have prejudice."   I seriously wonder why even bother fight for equality, when we could seriously just agree to not like each other if this is how things are going.  Even moreso, I know a person like that is anti-Affirmative Action.  This is why progress is next to impossible here in the US of A.

      I never knew the full deal about the conflict in Haiti.  This is from APOC.  Support Haitian People! no U.S. intervention no IMF and World Bank Embargo  200 years ago, Haitians fought for and achieved Independence from France, and established the World's first Black Republic.  Today, Transnational companies, such as NIKE, DISNEY AND LEVI¹S and other clothes and textile manufacturers benefit from inhumanely low wages of workers which Haitians get paid in the 'Free Trade Zones' established under IMF and World Bank 'advice'.  These transnational companies, as well as large landowners in Haiti, are supporting attempts to overthrow the elected President Jean Bertrand Aristide and moderate programs of reform and wealth distribution.Some of the armed insurgents are former members of the 30 Duvalier Dictatorship, and some are convicted participants in massacres.  The United States, who occupied the country for nearly 30 years this century, who sponsored and supported the brutal Duvalier dictatorship, are considering Military Intervention to continue exploiting Haitians for their resources and labour.  Conscientious people of the World should stop another imperialist intervention.  Haiti should work for Haitians, not for Transnational companies!

      Saw "Tv's Illest Minority Moments" on VH-1 yesterday with the mother and the Nia.  That was a really good show, Aaron McGruder (creator of the Boondocks) is now my idol.  He's like me, but artistic, and far funnier and he doesn't even look like he's thirty.  It's great stuff, and not to mention the show.  It really showed all these things I'd never even heard of from Tv's past, and put together you really realize how racist American TV has been and still is.  It really struck me painful to see how black people are treated as undesirable on reality shows.  Like Real World LA (1993), they kicked the black guy out because they didn't feel safe.   Holy God.  I hadn't even realized the thing that white America does to Asian women and Latinas on TV.  It overly sexifies them, after watching Allie McBeal I'd figure most Asian women are the ultra-sexy dragon ladies, and all latinas are horny sex machines who are overly open about everything to do with sex, I can't honestly say if I openly know if Latino culture is more open about sex then say, black people (we really aren't open about it though.... okay nevermind), but the thing is how the males are portrayed in turn.  Latino males are portrayed as usually being silly, sly, seductive or drunk/high.  While Asian men, oh lord.  Find me a show that actually uses real asian men that aren't short, buck toothed, with the coke bottle glasses, an insane accent for being American, or something along those lines.  Crazy stuff, but the show was amazing, I have it recorded.  Yeah, so it's all going well.  Went driving lessoning yesterday.  It got insanely easy in the course of 10 minutes after I pulled off.  Infact, it was hard not to speed it was so easy.  I still have one more lesson on sunday, so I should have my permit (finally) in a week.  Oh, and Nangila poetry reading.  Marcus jumped at the chance to read at it when I told him about it.  I swear this dudes eyes lit up.  It was some good stuff.  It seems like it'll blow over pretty well, I just need to meet the fellow people in this organization.

      Okay.  Long time no update.  I currently have my head slanted because I'm on the phone with the Killah Kelz.  She was sleepy but suddenly she's alert and perky as usual.  I tend to like words like perky, because they imply a metrosexual terminology to my common vernacular.  Kelz thought that was a funny thing to type.  In later news.  Black History breakfast.  Tommorow.  I get to keep in touch with my millitant African American heritage and further express our struggles in the African Diaspora.  Hell yeah, that sounded radical.  I'm pissed because the pigs (aka jakes, 5-0, Mr. Charlie, the Man, Heat, po-po, coppers, et cetera) killed another black man in Brooklyn, and the terrorist who killed him got away.  Mind control.  Psychology.  So, in respect for our fallen comrade, I will post again my favorite poem.  Niggers are scared of revolution But niggers shouldn't be scared of revolution Because revolution is nothing but change And all niggers do is change  Niggers come in from work and change into pimping clothes and hit the streets to make some quick change  Niggers change their hair from black to red to blond and hope like hell their looks will change  Nigger kill other niggers Just because one didn't receive the correct change  Niggers change from men to women, from women to men Niggers change, change, change  You hear niggers say          Things are changing?  Things are changing? Yeah, things are changing Niggers change into 'Black' nigger things Black nigger things that go through all kinds of changes The change in the day that makes them rant and rave          Black Power!  Black Power! And the change that comes over them at night, as they sigh and moan:          White thighs, ooh, white thighs  Niggers always goin' through bullshit change But when it comes for real change, Niggers are scared of revolution    Niggers are actors, niggers are actors Niggers act like they are in a hurry to catch the first act of the 'Great White Hope'  Niggers try to act like Malcolm And when the white man doesn't react  toward them like he did Malcolm Niggers want to act violently  Niggers act so coooool and slick causing white people to say: What makes you niggers act like that? Niggers act like you ain't never seen nobody act before But when it comes to acting out revolution Niggers say: 'I can't dig them actions!' Niggers are scared of revolution   Niggers are very untogether people Niggers talk about getting high and riding around in 'els' Niggers should get high and ride to hell Niggers talk about pimping          Pimping that, pimping what          Pimping yours, pimping mine          Just to be pimping, is a helluva line  Niggers are very untogether people Niggers talk about the mind Talk about: My mind is stronger than yours "I got that bitch's mind uptight!" Niggers don't know a damn thing about the mind Or they'd be right Niggers are scared of revolution   Niggers fuck.  Niggers fuck, fuck, fuck Niggers love the word fuck They think it's so fuckin' cute They fuck you around The first thing they say when they're mad: 'Fuck it' You play a little too much with them They say 'Fuck you' When it's time to TCB, Niggers are somewhere fucking Try to be nice to them, they fuck over you  Niggers don't realize while they doin' all this fucking They're getting fucked around And when they do realize it's too late So niggers just get fucked up  Niggers talk about fucking Fuckin' that, fuckin' this, fuckin' yours, fuckin' my sis Not knowing what they're fucking for They ain't fucking for love and appreciation Just fucking to be fucking.  Niggers fuck white thighs, black thighs, yellow thighs, brown thighs Niggers fuck ankles when they run out of thighs          Niggers fuck Sally, Linda, and Sue          And if you don't watch out          Niggers will fuck you! Niggers would fuck 'Fuck' if it could be fucked But when it comes to fucking for revolutionary causes Niggers say 'Fuck revolution!' Niggers are scared of revolution   Niggers are players, niggers are players, are players Niggers play football, baseball and basketball while the white man cuttin' off their balls  When the nigger's play ain't tight enough to play with some black thighs, Niggers play with white thighs to see if they still have some play left And when there ain't no white thighs to play with Niggers play with themselves  Niggers tell you they're ready to be liberated But when you say 'Let's go take our liberation' Niggers reply: 'I was just playin' Niggers are playing with revolution and losing Niggers are scared of revolution   Niggers do a lot of shootin' Niggers do a lot of shootin'  Niggers shoot off at the mouth Niggers shoot pool, niggers shoot craps Niggers cut around the corner and shoot down the street Niggers shoot sharp glances at white women Niggers shoot dope into their arm  Niggers shoot guns and rifles on New Year's Eve A new year that is coming in The white police will do more shooting at them Where are niggers when the revolution needs some shots!? Yeah, you know.  Niggers are somewhere shootin' the shit Niggers are scared of revolution   Niggers are lovers, niggers are lovers are lovers Niggers love to see Clark Gable make love to Marilyn Monroe Niggers love to see Tarzan fuck all the natives Niggers love to hear the Lone Ranger yell "Heigh Ho Silver!"  Niggers love commercials, niggers love commercials Oh how niggers love commercials: "You can take niggers out of the country, but  you can't take the country out of niggers"  Niggers are lovers, are lovers, are lovers Niggers loved to hear Malcolm rap But they didn't love Malcolm Niggers love everything but themselves  But I'm a lover too, yes I'm a lover too I love niggers, I love niggers, I love niggers  Because niggers are me And I should only love that which is me I love to see niggers go through changes Love to see niggers act Love to see niggers make them plays and shoot the shit  But there is one thing about niggers I do not love Niggers are scared of revolution  -The Last Poets   On a far brighter note.  I started driving lessons, and a week from monday should be good for me to get my permit.  I'll likely schedule a road test in Early September.  I don't actually care that much though, because what the hell am I going to be doing this summer?  Nothing como usual.  Alright.  I am outtie.

      City of God (Cidade De Deus) is by far my favorite movie of all time.  It seemed problematic at first because it was subtitled, but I really got alot out of it.  It was hardcore non-stop pulse pounding coolness.  I want to see it again with some friends, I saw it with my dad, so they can sit in shock as well.  It's really a crazy picture.  I found a dialogue from the movie I liked-  CABELEIRA -  Hey Berenice. Listen, I've got something real important to say. Tell me, you ever heard of love at first sight? BERENICE - Sure but bums don't fall in love, they just get horny.   CABELEIRA - C'mon, you cut everything I say to pieces. BERENICE - Bums don't talk, they just vomit words. CABELEIRA - Jesus, I'm gonna stop wasting my saliva on you, you sure ain't easy. BERENICE - Bums never stop, they just take a break. CABELEIRA - Jeez Berenice, talking about love with you is pretty complicated, isn't it? BERENICE - Love, you gotta be kidding. You're just leading me on.  CABELEIRA - But it's just that this jerk here loves you.  It was funny because this was a reccuring theme in the movie.    Seriously.  It's playing in Maplewood, you need to see it.

      "If only one fifth of your spells work you have real power. If only one fifth of your divinations work you have a serious disability." - Peter J.

      When I'm stressed, I hate it.  I mean, everyone hates being stressed, but I hate the actual feeling with this passion that I usually end up feeling more pissed then sad.  This is equally bad, because I can't be mad at an emotion.  I need to be mad at something less abstract.  It usually ends up that I try to take my mind off things by thinking of something else.  I started looking at BlackPlanet.com, wow, that was a mistake.  I'm starting to hate everything to do with hip-hop culture.  I mean, it's bad enough that Uncle Sam and The Man decided to give us AIDS, and allow us to be poor (I'm a strong believer in "umoja" your problems are my problems), but then we have to get a huge corporate system that feeds off pure ignorance and rewards people for it.  Damn.  I'm pretty pissed off, and some good people fromthe surrounding towns get caught up in that bs as well.   Wow.  Then church.  Granted, I'm not an agnostic, I believe in the One and I believe in The Truth, but besides that it's iffy.  I hate Church, black and white churches I have different reasons for hating.  Black churches, somehow, try to act like the voice of black liberation will teaching opression, and completely ignoring extremely important things that are native in most African cultures (ancestor worship, which I've even known non-religious people to do), hell even the Carribeans didn't completely let it die out.  I guess it's the whole "Well, I'm a minster, my job is in the church" type of thing that annoys me firstly.  Yes, you have a degree in administrating a church, and doing all sorts of social activities, oh and you have a degree in reading the bible (I am over simplifying matters, because I don't know enough about the subject), but why do you suddenly act like you have the voice of a god reverands?  I don't care if god gave you a vision about giving money to the church, I didn't get that vision, so it wasn't all that important.   Then, I have to go to church until I'm 18 and move out according to my mother.  That wouldn't seem that extreme, except I expressed a desire to go to another church, and pointed out that I'm confirmed.  I am free to do what I want in matters of my spiritual growth, it's no longer her responsibility.  That really burns me up, add to the stress, and all I can hang onto for stability is anger.

      This concept is so important, and I'm going to be using it alot, so don't be suprised.  I'm in shock that this isn't the first word we're taught in school since with the advent of a digital society it'll become more and more relevant.    MEME (n)- A unit of cultural information, such as a cultural practice or idea, that is transmitted verbally or by repeated action from one mind to another.  It's pronounced like dream.

      Long day of school.    Amir is one of the funniest people.  He came over to our table at lunch today and says to us says "Yo, I'm mad amped! We're about to get a latino heritage club.  People are organizing without the elitist people at the top telling us too!" and being the pesissimist I am I says to him says "What about COINTELPRO?" hahaha.  Only a minority could love that.

      Poetry reading.  Dirty Backpack crowd as I expected.  Alot of nice poets (one especially disturbing poem), and a decent crowd (18 people showed up who didn't help add to the helpers and we had like 25ish people).   The Feature Poet, Jamal St. John, was particurally good.  I'm pissed that I was the only person holding down CHS though, that's pretty annoying since mad pendajos says to me says "Yeah, I wanna go."  Pendajos.  It was mostly girls, except me, and the other NNB member (I'm not talented enough to spell his name) and Chris the OG Nangila member.  Most of the girls were pretty, so everything was made up for with that and the content of what they said.  Before that, we did an FNL filming.  Quite cold, but quite funny.  You'll have to wait for the show to see that.  It was good stuff.

      Note on mortality.  Has anyone considered what it was like before they were born?  You were like that for almost an infinity, but somehow that's not exactly scary.  It was sensationless, and when I look back on it, that doesn't really bother me.  I just didn't exist, but at the same time all the parts of my body existed, all the blood that circulates in it now, existed.  So was I really born?  Or was I formed together?  So, really, this is just a current state we're in, and I find it hard to believe an afterlife exist, and if it did without your body would you really be the same person?  First FNL practice today.  Imagine a room filled with people who love to be the center of attention.  Yeah, pretty nuts.

      Oh, btw, I got into FNL.    This event was so momentous I, that I actually did my homework.    On the note of homework I talked to Michelle today, the person I was obsessed over in 7th grade (when I had no social skills to speak of), it's always nice to network with someone you haven't talked to in awhile.  That's why college is really gonna suck.  Am I gonna still just talk to my high school friends over IM?  Are we just gonna fall out of contact?  Some of us have been together since Kindergarden, and soon after 13 years of contact, we're gonna more-or-less just stop talking.  Just scatter to the far corners of the Earth.  That's a reason I'm hesistant about going to California for college, the thought recently entered my mind, and it seemed better when it snowed today, but still I don't want to move on to a completely new group of friends just yet.

      I ended up trying out for FNL, just to try and busy up my schedule.  I don't really care if I got in or not, since it's only four weeks of hell.  But whatever, I hope I got in.  The tryouts were great to watch and all.  Oooh, and Becky was pretty zealous about handing out flyers for me (everyone wants to help) and I thought that was pretty cool.    So, school proper wasn't anything special.  It never is.  Pictures though, you digital pictures are crazy.   You can find out so much about people by looking at their pictures, and it's so funny to see them on the internet.  People will usually hold in a lot when you meet them face to face, but on the internet your personality is all you are, so your more or less free.  I guess that sounds rather cryptic.  My eyes are seriously sore.

      I missed the FNL Auditions, but I honestly don't care.  I have Nangila stuff to worry about now.  I've ironically avoided talking about it, for ummm... Racial reasons, because we don't want it to turn into a DPZ concert.  Since no one understands the reference, no one is offended.  Ask me if your interested.

      This is a long article, but it's quite relevant.  It's written by a Black Gay Man, who has seen a disturbing trend in the media.  Enjoy.   Is Gay Marriage Anti-Black? By Kenyon Farrow   I was in Atlanta on business when I saw the Sunday, Feb. 29th edition of the Atlanta Journal Constitution that featured as its cover story the issue of gay marriage. Georgia is one of the states prepared to add some additional language to its state constitution that bans same sex marriages (though the state already defines marriage between a man and a woman, so the legislation is completely symbolic as it is political). What struck me about the front page story was the fact that all of the average Atlanta citizens whom were pictured that opposed gay marriages were black people. This is not to single out the Atlanta Journal Constitution, as I have noticed in all of the recent coverage and hubbub over gay marriage that the media has been real crucial in playing up the racial politics of the debate. For example, the people who are in San Francisco getting married are almost exclusively white whereas many of the people who are shown opposing it are black. And it is more black people than typically shown in the evening news (not in handcuffs). This leaves me with several questions: Is gay marriage a black/white issue? Are the Gay Community and the Black Community natural allies or sworn enemies? And where does that leave me, a black gay man, who does not want to get married?  Same-sex Marriage and Race Politics My sister really believes that this push for gay marriage is actually not being controlled by gays & lesbians. She believes it is actually being tested in various states by the Far Right in disguise, in an effort to cause major fractures in the Democratic Party to distract from all the possible roadblocks to re-election for George W. in November such as an unpopular war and occupation, the continued loss of jobs, and growing revelations of the Bush administrations ties to corporate scandals.  Whatever the case, it is important to remember that gay marriage rights are fraught with racial politics, and that there is no question that the public opposition to same-sex marriages is in large part being financially backed by various right-wing Christian groups like the Christian Coalition and Family Research Council. Both groups have histories and overlapping staff ties to white supremacist groups and solidly oppose affirmative action but play up some sort of Christian allegiance to the black Community when the gay marriage issue is involved. For example, in 1990s the Traditional Values Coalition produced a short documentary called Gay Rights, Special Rights, which was targeted at black churches to paint non-heterosexual people as only white and upper class, and as sexual pariahs, while painting black people as pure, chaste, and morally superior. The video juxtaposed images of white gay men for the leather/S&M community with the voice of Dr. Martin Luther Kings I Have a Dream speech, leaving conservative black viewers with the fear that the Civil Rights Movement was being taken over by morally debased human beings. And since black people continue to be represented as hyper sexual beings and sexual predators in both pop culture and the mass media (pimps & players, hoochies & hos, rapists of white women & tempters of white men), conservative black people often cling to the other image white America hoists onto black people as well ­ asexual and morally superior (as seen in the role of the black talk show host and the role of the black sage/savior-of-white people used in so many Hollywood movies, like In America and The Green Mile, which are all traceable to Mammy and Uncle Remus-type caricatures).  Since the Christian Right has money and access to corporate media, they set the racial/sexual paradigm that much of America gets in this debate, which is that homos are rich and white and do not need any such special protections and that black people are black ­ a homogeneous group who, in this case, are Christian, asexual (or hetero-normative), morally superior, and have the right type of family values. This, even though black families are consistently painted as dysfunctional and are treated as such in the mass media and in public policy, which has devastating effects on black self-esteem, and urban and rural black communities ability to be self-supporting, self-sustaining, and self determining. The lack of control over economic resources, high un/underemployment, lack of adequate funding for targeted effective HIV prevention and treatment, and the large numbers of black people in prison (nearly one million of the 2.2 million U.S. prison population) are all ways that black families (which include non-heterosexuals) are undermined by public policies often fueled by right wing tough on crime and war on drugs rhetoric.  Given all of these social problems that largely plague the black community (and thinking about my sisters theory), one has to wonder why this issue would rise to the surface in an election year, just when the Democratic ticket is unifying. And it is an issue, according to the polls anyway, that could potentially strip the Democratic Party of it solid support from African-American communities. And even though several old-guard civil rights leaders (including Coretta Scott King, John Lewis, Revs. Al Sharpton, and Jesse Jackson) have long supported equal protection under the law for the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community (which usually, but not always means support of same-sex marriage), the right wing continues to pit gay marriage (and by extension, gay civil rights) against black political interests, by relying on conservative black people to publicly speak out against it (and a lot has been written about how several black ministers received monies from right-wing organizations to speak out against same-sex marriages in their pulpits). But many black leaders, including some Ive been able to catch on television recently despite the right-wings spin on the matter, have made the argument that they know too well the dangers that lie in separate but equal rhetoric. So, if many of our black leaders vocally support same-sex marriage, how has the Christian Right been able to create such a wedge between the black community and the gay community?  Homophobia in Black Popular Culture Some of the ways that the Christian Right-wing has been so successful in using same-sex marriage as a wedge issue is by both exploiting homophobia in the black community and also racism in the gay community. In regards to homophobia in the black community the focus of conversation has been about the Black Churches stance on homosexuality. It has been said many times that while many black churches remain somewhat hostile places for non-heterosexual parishioners, it is also where you will in fact find many black gays and lesbians. Many of them are in positions of power and leadership within the church ­ ushers, choir members/directors, musicians, and even preachers themselves. But let me debunk the myth that the Black Church is the black community. The black community is in no way monolithic, nor are black Christians. The vast majority of black people who identify as Christian do not attend any church whatsoever. Many black Americans have been Muslim for over a century and there are larger numbers of black people who are proudly identifying as Yoruba, Santero/a, and atheists as well. The black community in America is also growing more ethnically diverse, with a larger, more visible presence of Africans, West Indians, and Afro-Latinos amongst our ranks. We have always been politically diverse, with conservatives, liberals, radicals and revolutionaries alike (and politics do not necessarily align with what religion you may identify as your own). It is also true that we are and have always been sexually diverse and multi-gendered. Many of our well-known Black History Month favorites were in fact Gay, Bisexual, Lesbian, or Transgender.  Despite our internal diversity, we are at a time (for the last 30 years) when black people are portrayed in the mass mediamostly through hip-hop cultureas being hyper-sexual and hyper-heterosexual to be specific.   Nowhere is the performance of black masculinity more prevalent than in hip-hop culture, which is where the most palpable form of homophobia in American culture currently resides. This of course is due largely to the white record industrys notions of who we are, which they also sell to non-black people. Remember pop culture has for the last 150 years been presenting blackness to the world ­ initially as white performers in blackface, to black performers in black face, and currently to white, black and other racial groups performing blackness as something that connotes sexual potency and a propensity for violent behavior, which are also performed as heterosexuality.  And with the music video, performance is important (if not more) than song content. As black hip-hop artists perform gangsta and Black Nationalist revolutionary forms of masculinity alike, so follows overt homophobia and hostility to queer people, gay men in particular. Recently, DMXs video and song Where the Hood At? contained some of the most blatant and hateful homophobic lyrics and images I have seen in about a decade. The song suggests that the faggot can and will never be part of the hood for he is not a man. The song and video are particularly targeted at black men who are not out of the closet, and considered on the down low. Although challenged by DMX, the image of the down low brother is another form of performance of black masculinity, regardless of actual sexual preference.  But its not just commercial rap artists being homophobic. Conscious hip­hop artists such as Common, Dead Prez and Mos Def have also promoted homophobia through their lyrics, mostly around notions of strong black families, and since gay black men (in theory) do not have children, we are somehow anti-family and antithetical to what a strong black man should be. Lesbians (who are not interested in performing sex acts for the pleasure of men voyeurs) are also seen as anti-family, and not a part of the black community. A woman not wanting dick in a nation where black dick is the only tangible power symbol for black men is seen as just plain crazy, which is also expressed in many hip-hop tunes. None of these artists interrogate their representations of masculinity in their music, but merely perform them for street credibility. And for white market consumption.  It cannot be taken lightly that white men are in control of the record industry as a whole (even with a few black entrepreneurs), and control what images get played. Young white suburban males are the largest consumer of hip-hop music. So performance of black masculinity (or black sexuality as a whole) is created by white men for white men. And since white men have always portrayed black men as sexually dangerous and black women as always sexually available (and sexual violence against black women is rarely taken seriously), simplistic representations of black sexuality as hyper-heterosexual are important to maintaining white supremacy and patriarchy, and control of black bodies. Black people are merely the unfortunate middlemen in an exchange between white men. We consume the representations like the rest of America. And the more that black people are willing to accept these representations as fact rather than racist fiction, the more heightened homophobia in our communities tends to be.  Race and the Gay Community While homophobia in the black community is certainly an issue we need to address, blacks of all sexualities experience the reality that many white gays and lesbians think that because theyre gay, they understand oppression, and therefore could not be racist like their heterosexual counterparts. Bullshit. America is first built on the privilege of whiteness, and as long as you have white skin, you have a level of agency and access above and beyond people of color, period. White women and white non-heteros included. There is a white gay man named Charles Knipp who roams this nation performing drag in blackface to sold-out houses, north and south alike. Just this past Valentines day weekend, he performed at the Slide Bar in NYs east village to a packed house of white queer folks eager to see him perform Shirley Q Liquor, a welfare mother with 19 kids. And havent all of the popular culture gay images on TV shows like Will & Grace, Queer as Folk, etc., been exclusively white? No matter how many black divas wail over club beats in white gay clubs all over America (Mammy goes disco!) with gay men appropriating language and other black cultural norms (specifically from black women), white gay men continue to function as cultural imperialists the same way straight white boys appropriate hip-hop (and lets not ignore that white women have been in on the act, largely a result of Madonna bringing white women into the game.).  There have always been racial tensions in the gay community as long as there have been racial tensions in America, but in the 1990s, the white gay community went mainstream, further pushing non-hetero people of color from the movement.  The reason for this schism is that in order to be mainstream in America, one has to be seen as white. And since white is normative, one has to interrogate what other labels or institutions are seen as normative in our society: family, marriage, and military service, to name a few. It is then no surprise that a movement that goes for normality would then end up in a battle over a dubious institution like marriage (and hetero-normative family structures by extension). And debates over family values, no matter how broad or narrow you look at them, always have whiteness at the center, and are almost always anti-black. As articulated by Robin D.G. Kelley in his book Yo Mamas Dysfunktional, the infamous Moynihan report is the most egregious of examples of how the black family structure has been portrayed as dysfunctional, an image that still has influence on the way in which black families are discussed in the media and controlled by law enforcement and public policy. Since black families are in fact presented and treated as dysfunctional, this explains the large numbers of black children in the hands of the state through foster care, and increasingly, prisons (so-called youth detention centers). In many cases, trans-racial adoptions are the result. Many white same-sex unions take advantage of the states treatment of black families; after all, white queer couples are known for adopting black children since they are so readily available and also not considered as attractive or healthy compared to white, Asian and Latino/a kids. If black families were not labeled as dysfunctional or de-stabilized by prison expansion and welfare reform, our children would not be removed from their homes at the numbers they are, and there would be no need for adoption or foster care in the first place. So the fact that the white gay community continues to use white images of same-sex families is no accident, since the black family, heterosexual, same sex or otherwise, is always portrayed as dysfunctional.  I also think the white gay communitys supposed understanding of racism is what has caused them to appropriate language and ideology of the Black Civil Rights Movement, which has led to the bitter divide between the two communities. This is where I as a black gay man, am forced to intervene in a debate that I find problematic on all sides.  Black Community and Gay Community ­ Natural Allies or Sworn Enemies? As the gay community moved more to the right in the 1990s, they also began to talk about Gay Rights as Civil Rights. Even today in this gay marriage debate, I have heard countless well-groomed, well-fed white gays and lesbians on TV referring to themselves as second-class citizens. Jason West, the white mayor of New Paltz, NY, who started marrying gay couples was quoted as saying, The same people who dont want to see gays and lesbians get married are the same people who would have made Rosa Parks go to the back of the bus." Its these comparisons that piss black people off. While the anger of black heteros is sometimes expressed in ways that are in fact homophobic, the truth of the matter is that black folks are tired of seeing other people hijack their shit for their own gains, and getting nothing in return. Black non-heteros share this anger of having our blackness and black political rhetoric and struggle stolen for other peoples gains. The hijacking of Rosa Parks for their campaigns clearly ignores the fact that white gays and lesbians who lived in Montgomery, AL and elsewhere probably gladly made many a black person go to the back of the bus. James Baldwin wrote in his long essay No Name in the Street about how he was felt up by a white sheriff in a small southern town when on a visit during the civil rights era.  These comparisons of Gay Civil Rights as equal to Black Civil Rights really began in the early 1990s, and largely responsible for this was Human Rights Campaign (HRC) and a few other mostly-white gay organizations. This push from HRC, without any visible black leadership or tangible support from black allies (straight and queer), to equate these movements did several things: 1) Piss off the black community for the white gay movements cultural appropriation, and making the straight black community question non-hetero black peoples allegiances, resulting in our further isolation. 2) Giving the (white) Christian Right ammunition to build relationships with black ministers to denounce gay rights from their pulpits based on the HRCs cultural appropriation. 3) Create a scenario in their effort to go mainstream that equates gay and lesbian with upper-class and white. This meant that the only visibility of non-hetero poor people and people of color wound up on Jerry Springer, where non-heteros who are poor and of color are encouraged (and paid) to act out, and are therefore only represented as dishonest, violent, and pathological.  So, given this difficult history and problematic working relationship of the black community and the gay community, how can the gay community now, at its most crucial hour, expect large scale support of same-sex marriage by the black community when there has been no real work done to build strategic allies with us? A new coalition has formed of black people, non-hetero and hetero, to promote same-sex marriage equality to the black community, and I assume to effectively bridge that disconnect, and to in effect, say that gay marriage aint just a white thing. Or is it?  Is Gay Marriage Anti ­ Black? I, as a black gay man, do not support this push for same-sex marriage. Although I dont claim to represent all black gay people, I do believe that the manner in which this campaign has been handled has put black people in the middle of essentially two white groups of people, who are trying to manipulate us one way or the other. The Christian right, which is in fact anti-black, has tried to create a false alliance between themselves and blacks through religion to push forward their homophobic, fascist agenda. The white gay civil rights groups are also anti-black, however they want black people to see this struggle for same-sex unions as tantamount to separate but equal Jim Crow laws. Yet any close examination reveals that histories of terror imposed upon generations of all black people in this country do not in any way compare to what appears to be the very last barrier between white gays and lesbians access to what bell hooks describes as christian capitalist patriarchy. That system is inherently anti-black, and no amount of civil rights will ever get black people any real liberation from it. For, in what is now a good 40 years of civil rights, nothing has intrinsically changed or altered in the American power structure, and a few black faces in inherently racist institutions is hardly progress.  Given the current white hetero-normative constructions of family and how the institutions of marriage and nuclear families have been used against black people, I do think that to support same-sex marriage is in fact, anti-black (I also believe the institution of marriage to be historically anti-woman, and dont support it for those reasons as well). At this point I dont know if I am totally opposed to the institution of marriage altogether, but I do know that the campaign would have to happen on very different terms for me to support same-sex marriages. At this point, the white gay community is as much to blame as the Christian right for the way they have constructed the campaign, including who is represented, and their appropriation of black civil rights language.  Along with how the campaign is currently devised, I struggle with same-sex marriage because, given the level of homophobia in our society (specifically in the black community), and racism as well, I think that even if same-sex marriage becomes legal, white people will access that privilege far more than black people. This is especially the case with poor black people, who regardless of sexual preference or gender, are struggling with the most critical of needs (housing, food, gainful employment), which are not at all met by same-sex marriage. Some black people (men in particular) might not try to access same-sex marriage because they do not even identify as gay partly because of homophobia in the black community, but also because of the fact that racist white queer people continue to dominate the public discourse of what gay is, which does not include black people of the hip-hop generation by and large.  I do fully understand that non-heteros of all races and classes may cheer this effort for they want their love to be recognized, and may want to reap some of the practical benefits that a marriage entitlement would bring ­ health care (if one of you gets health care from your job in the first place) for your spouse, hospital visits without drama or scrutiny, and control over a deceased partners estate. But, gay marriage, in and of itself, is not a move towards real, and systemic liberation. It does not address my most critical need as a black gay man to be able to walk down the streets of my community with my lover, spouse or trick, and not be subjected to ridicule, assault or even murder. Gay marriage does not adequately address homophobia or transphobia, for same-sex marriage still implies binary opposite thinking, and transgender folks are not at all addressed in this debate.  What does gay marriage mean for all Black people? But what does that mean for black people? For black non-heteros, specifically? Am I supposed to get behind this effort, and convince heterosexual black people to do the same, especially when I know the racist manner in which this campaign has been carried out for over ten years? And especially when I know that the vast majority of issues that my communityThe Black Community, of all orientations and gendersare not taken nearly this seriously when it comes to crucial life and death issues that we face daily like inadequate housing and health care, HIV/AIDS, police brutality, and the wholesale lockdown of an entire generation in Americas grotesquely large prison system. How do those of us who are non-heterosexual and black use this as an opportunity to deal with homophobia, transphobia and misogyny in our communities, and heal those larger wounds of isolation, marginalization and fear that plague us regardless of marital status? It is the undoing of systems of domination and control that will lead to liberation for all of ourselves, and all of us as a whole.  In the end, I am down for black people who oppose gay marriageother folks in the life as well as straight, feminists, Christians, Muslims, and the like. But I want more than just quotes from Leviticus or other religious and moral posturing. I want to engage in a meaningful critical conversation of what this means for all of us, which means that I must not be afraid to be me in our community, and you must not be afraid of me. I will struggle alongside you, but I must know that you will also have my back.

      Weekend Report-  What has it been with me since the end of Sophomore Year?  I've tottally changed the people I hung around.  I don't even think the same way, it's only a shame I started this late.    Like the Nangila Poetry Reading thing.  I never actually considered that I'd be helping organize some type of Poetry Reading for some angry black people.  It just never seemed like my type of thing, and I was hesistant at first, but the wonderfulness of Kelz sisters oratory skills gave me a new perspective, so there I am.  Besides that?  Nothing really special.  I guess I could talk about the Music Marathon, but nothing really to say since we came and went and today I spent half my damn waking hours taking a Kaplan SAT.  Gah.

      This will be important later.   U.S. Denies Iran Report Of Bin Laden's Capture  By Reuters,  March 4, 2004   The U.S. Department of Defense recently denied reports by Iran's official IRNA news agency on Saturday that al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden has been captured.   IRNA quoted a story on Iran's state radio Pashtun service which reported "a very reliable source" as saying bin Laden had been captured in a tribal area of Pakistan.   A senior U.S. defense official denied the report, telling Reuters it was "another piece of stray voltage that's passing around out there."   And Pakistan's Foreign Minister Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri told a news conference he was aware of the Iranian report, but added: "We cannot confirm it at all."   Washington says bin Laden masterminded the September 11, 2001, suicide hijack attacks in the United States, which killed nearly 3,000 people.   The Iranian correspondent responsible for the report told Reuters the radio had also reported bin Laden's capture a year ago. But said a new source had told him on Friday the al Qaeda leader had been seized "a long time ago."   "It could be one month ago, it could be one year, but he has been arrested," he said.   While declining to reveal his source or how his source knew of the capture, he said: "My source said it and he knows it."   Pakistani troops earlier this week arrested 20 suspects in an operation against al Qaeda and Taliban militants in South Waziristan. Officials said none were leading al Qaeda militants.   The U.S. military said this month that U.S.-led troops in Afghanistan were moving toward coordinated operations along the border -- "a hammer and anvil approach" -- to prevent fleeing al Qaeda fighters from escaping simply by crossing from one country into the other.   Pakistan, a key ally in the U.S.-led war on terror, has stepped up efforts in recent weeks against al Qaeda and Taliban fighters as the 10,600-strong U.S. force in Afghanistan gears up for a spring offensive against Islamic militants.  .

      Although quite about was experienced by me this weekend, one thing remains the most important.  Kelly, despite everything I've thought about her, is infact not an Asian.  I may have been quite fooled by her facade during the play, and I think it'd be funny to go through my though process as I watched her dance in her school musical (Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat brought to you by Oak Knoll).  Here is how it started upon first seeing her (she had a black wig on, and the hair was straight mind you add in that she took away her glasses as well):  "Wow, that Asian girl sure looks good."  "Oooh my goodness, no.  Only black girls look good! Must enforce social engineering on myself!"  "Hmmm... She looks like she's Fillippino or something.  That would explain the dark skin."  Time passed by, I noticed some Semetic-Hindic looking people walk by, a decent number.  "Wow, sure are alot of Indian (Or Arab) people at this school.  Oooh snap! That girl is Arab or Indian that explains everything."  Kelly's sister comes and sits in front of me.  I don't really pay attention to her pointing Kelly out (I instantly knew it was Kelly's sister).    "Oooh wait.  That girl isn't Asian, it's Kelly!"  Lo and behold it was.  That's the amazingness of my thought process.   Next order of business.  I hadn't really thought about it until today, I've suddenly started to hang out with far more black people then usual.  I think it's that identity crisis thing that hits people in high school, at least minorities.  Abby pointed it out once, that most of the black people in our journalism class sit on one side of the room.  This is of course true, and ironically, I believe I unconsciously gravitated towards that side.    That's not the point though.  I even intentionally changed where I sat at lunch to get a better look at certain people's booties.  Ahaahaha.  I said booty. Well, this guy, I think his name was Brandon, he comes and sits at our table today.  This guy wasn't exactly 'hard' but he was more or less hardened by Black Pop Culture into the media image he's supposed to be.  Some of his friends came over, I only knew one of them and they started talking about a dance at Seton Hall (I'll assume it was the Jack and Jill one) and you know "Shuckin' and Jivin'' (I love Hot97).  It was at that point I realized something about DuBois and his talented 10th philosophy.  Not only is it correct, but when you see Black people who are more or less sheep and feel pain about it, you need to realize that most people by nature are sheep.  It really depends on the people who are leading them.  This is why democracy doesn't really work too well, most people are sheep.  That's why so people vote today, no real care.  Hell, most people only need to know they can have minimal input in the government to believe democracy works.  Now what does this have to do with my revolutionary black philosophy?  Well, most leaders seem to start in the wrong place.  It's the idea of 'memes' or information in a human population working like a virus or dna.  Over time it spreads throughtout the population.  Popular culture is an extremely virulent meme, especially 'racial images'.   Most sheep can usually by caught by those in a second, and speaking directly to the sheep usually isn't as effective as changing the primary viral stuff.  That's why alot of movements for social change are doomed for failure.  Now of course, many will say I'm being a conspiracy theorist, but like the exploitation done under Capitalism, I don't believe the opressors are fully aware of it.  So, what's the solution?  Do a group of people who believe they have control, try and control everyone else?  Yes and no.  We've fought throughout history over who has the right to rule, that's why we let god adjudicate.  Of course we needed to create a god, that would rule over us... "..God created humanity; [but now human beings] create God.  That is the way it is in the world- human beings make gods, and worship their creation.  It would be more appropriate for the gods to worship human beings!"-Gospel of Phillip.  I guess things are still like that, people can't force their views directly so we create things that are more powerful then us to give our commandments down.    This puts anyone seeking liberation into a ---  Well I'm running too long with theory and not enough about social things most of which I neglected to mention, like the fact I met Jodie.  Or that one of Kelly's sexually appealing (!) blonde friends who wonders where Cahoots is, thinks I'm cute (because I am like Wayne Brady white people love me).  But that's just a rumor, and I really don't show love to homothugs, I mean rumors.

      Interesting day.  This weekend makes me want to murder myself, only alleviated by the fact I was wise enough NOT to take the SAT's this weekend.  I have a journalism research paper, which in theory shouldn't be that bad, I've already started, but realized I didn't note my research so the writting of the paper is becoming really stop and go, but I can deal with that aspect of the research.  It'll just take forever to write, and it'll come out sub-par, I'll end up worrying about it, and Mrs. McGrane will just give a B (possibly with a plus or minus as garnish) regardless of how well I write it (that's not true at all).  I had a black people bonding moment today.  It made me feeel all grown up.  This lady was trying to pick up her grandson from SHU and she couldn't find him so she was panicking and asking me for directions.  I told her to call him, but neither her or her grandson had a cell phone, so I let her use mine.  I had to get in her car (she was an old black church lady though, so it was all good) and guide her to the place, and it ended up we missed her grandson who had to run around the block to catch her.  But no worries, it's all good, because he came and I got a ride home.  The whole community thing that goes on with black people is always nice, and I feel glad to know I contributed something positive too it.  The funny thing, since I try to cut down on the amount of parent-personal life dialogue, I don't plan on ever telling them about it.  I'm strange I guess.

      Today was interesting.  Project Adventure.  Scary ish.  I didn't even go up today because I was shaking too much from the wind and/or the thought of being suspended 30 feet in the air.  So that was failure.  Next, school day was fine, I resisted the urge to cut economics.  I convinced myself somehow that it would be worthwhile, we got a huge packet for break.  So that was a wise move.    Afterschool.  Walked home, glad that stage of my life is coming to an end.  Next I took a shower, mainly because I felt grimes since I couldn't remember the last time I took one.  Which probubly meant Thursday morning was the last time, considering how bad my memory is.  So then we went to pick up Nia, who just got braces.  Funny.  Train station to go to Morristown too see Sonya.  I almost got on the Gladstone line, but fortunately I found out last minute.  So I arrived in Morristown sometime later.  No Sonya.  Oh no, I thought.  Maybe she played me for a fool! So I began to overanalyze the situation and paced back and forth.  People were walking by and speaking Spanish! What a hectic language when your stressed! But anyway, somehow living in Morristown didn't dilute her sense of CPT.  So she showed up along with her friend Jen.  Coffee Shop.  Rain.  Burger King.  Home.  It was far more detailed then that, but that's the basic rundown.    Why is it that people from other towns universally seem to look older then people from SOM (S.O. Maplewood)? I noticed that at first in Cancun, but also, Sonya and Jen both look like I'd expect high school students to look like, and even talk like.  At Columbia something just seems different, everything feels like bitter Middle Schoolers, even if I can't remember much of middle school.  That was just a side note of course.  Train situation going back was the best.  I said adios, and got on the train.  The lady said "Next stop, Morris Plains."  Shit.  Morris Plains was taking me even farther away from home.  The lady asked where I was going, and I says to her says SO.  She frowned and said we were going the other way, and I'd have to wait until we got to Dover for the train to turn around.  Fair enough.  That took forever mind you, but it happened.  As a side note, a huge amount of colored people use the trains, it seems so strangely disproportional since everywhere we went we were picking up Latinos, Blacks or Indians.  But anyway, I had to get off at Summit because it was direct to Broad Street.  I stood around the station in the cold, got on the train, came to SO.  Stood around in the cold, and then dad picked me up.  Now the fun began anew.  We're going to Florida at 6:00AM TODAY.  It's currently 1AM, and I'm trying to stay up in the hopes it'll weaken me for the flight.  I'm not coming back until Thursday, but my dad is a jet setter so I should be on and off the internet over the next few days.  I'm just that cool.

      Two major thoughts.    First the school related one.  Perhaps I'm the only person who thinks this way, but in my Math class some other dark skinned(ed) guy joined.  I'm assuming his black or a moreno or both.  It doesn't really matter.  The thing is between me and him we're the only colored guys in the class, unless Chad counts, but meh... Calling azns colored always feels awkward even if it's proper.  As a side note, when I use the word colored I usually mean anyone who isn't white.  White is a very general term though.  Some arabs could be counted as white, and the aryans who live in central Asia/India/Iran etc. many of them could also be considered white.  But everyone else, and I do mean everyone else  technically  is colored.  Middle Aged to Older black people will often use this to mean exclusively black people.  Anyway, I found the mass class situation interesting, since I've always been bothered by being the only colored fella.  Secondly, chruch, oh church.  It's one of the strongest enforces of memes it's kind of insane.  It can spread so insanely fast, and I just can't understand why education hasn't taken a few pages from religion, just look how easy it is to learn a religion and spread it to someone else.

      I really can't get over this one question.  Is gay marriage really anti-black?  That's one issue they don't talk about on Week-In-Review, best show on AM1600 WWRL.  I think Spike Lee even had one of the guys from it in Bamboozled.  They were talking about Bush's middle east policy today, and they started talking about my boy Mommar Al-Gaddaffi. The current coolest Arab/African leader (he is clearly an ethnic Arab).  They were talking about how the rest of the Arab world marginalizes Palestine, and how that's causing alot of sides to fragment over one Arab state.  Big things.

      Now for your viewing enjoyment, the angry white people article from WOHS made during black history month in it's entirety.  Courtesy of Thomas-   Constantly Risking Absurdity By: Caitlin O'Keeffe  I declared, rather loudly, to one of the two black students in my environmental science class that he was not really black. I had no intention of upsetting him at all, for some strange reason, I almost thought that it would make him happy, or at least make the other things that I said, which I realize in retrospect were extremely racist, not hurt him as much. I understand completely that he is a young black man, but from the few classes that we've shared over the years, I formed the opinion that he acted white, not black. I can't say that I was particularly prejudice, because I formed my opinion, that he was not really black after some conversations and basic interaction with him. But I can say that I cam to the opinion through some rather distorted logic.  This boy didn't conduct himself in a loud, disruptive manner. He was one of the best students in this honors level class, and any other class that I had with him. He attended Boy's State and Governor's School, not even I got to do those things! He said "Hello" rather than the stereotypical "Yo" that I would have expected to hear from him. He always asked questions, never "ax-ing" them, and he celebrated birthdays, never once having a "birfday". His attire is always exemplary, never having pants hanging around his ankles or white tee's that are five sizes to big. To my knowledge, he's never sat in lunch with a big bucket of fried chicken and collard greens, licking his fingers after every bite. There are no suspensions on his records for fighting with his classmates or disrespecting his teachers. He's not one of those "baby daddies", fathering more children than he can support.  I quickly realized, after the words left my mouth, that I had offended him and the other black student that was in the class. Their jaws hit the floor, mine froze. I knew my friend Hannah, who was standing next to me, agreed with me but I was in this one on my own. I tried to justify myself by telling him that he simply didn't do the things other black people did, and he tried to explain to me that, that doesn't make him any less black. I didn't get it. I couldn't see past the fact that he simply acted white, at leas by my standards. We walked out of the class and went our separate ways. He didn't seem to hear me shouting apologies, or maybe he knew that I wasn't sure why I was apologizing. I kept on walking in a daze, Hannah beside me the whole time, talking with me really hearing her.  Trying to get to gym relatively on time, I got rather frustrated when I stumbled across a group of black students, who were making their presence known to everyone that was within earshot of them. Still being in shock from the incident that had just occurred I bit my tongue, rather than mumbling my usual obscenities, and walked on. To my horrible surprise, the next traffic jam I encountered in the hallway, after the bell had rung, was a group of white kids! People that I know and that I am friends with, not nameless faces. The fact that they were being loud shocked me even more. I never noticed that it wasn't just the usual black kids that were obnoxious in the halls but white kids, me included do it too.

      My dad let me drive his car, that was a major plus.  I only gave him a fright once when I didn't stop until I was right on top of the bumper of a car.  Granted,  I stopped without completely lurching the car forward... but details....  So that was fun.  Grandparents came over.  Watched Chappelle (TiVo'd) with mother.  Cried at the funniness factor.  Came back into the basement, played video games.  Got bored, quit.  Thought about FNL, got sad again. Talked to Kelly, no Sonya (!), felt more sad.  So I searched around the web, looked at Alex's forum, then my friendster stuff, and now I'm writting.   On the bright side I'm seeing Kill Bill Vol. 2 tommorow.

      I'm so depressed, it's almost funny.  FNL was yesterday, and we had practice the entire school day.  Needless to say, it was great bonding time, especially the extra-long lunch.  I could go on and on, but it was sooo much fun, it completely eclipses the New York trip in the fun-ness factor.  The show itself was so filled with running back and forth, and stress, but it was all good.  I was really hyped after, and eating dinner after didn't even get rid of the hype.  So when I got home at around 10:40, I watched an hour of TV and tried to sleep, but every time I was about to doze off I'd flashback to FNL and be wide awake.    So today I was pretty sad.  I guess consolation was that I was able to talk to Sonya.

      Fun fun fun.  Christian Holiday.  I enjoyed it as usual, the stress of the Easter program, and the interrogation about my own religious practices.  Meh.  Christianity is completely off from how I see it, and yet it works in the manner that it should.  So messed up.     Funny thing was going out to Dover to spend time with the Cousins.  That was fun, Ginn was telling us about her job at Deleware State, and her future plans.  She doesn't seem like the type of person on the surface, but she's a real genius.  This of course makes you wonder about some of the stuff she does, like letting my sister drink some of her concotion 'Jesus Juice'.  Ice Cream, and some good stuff....   Meh.  I'm tottally forgetting to do any work this weekend, and it'll come back to bite me in the ass, but I really could care less about now.  I just need to read one more chapter for cotter, and I'll feel good and sexy.

      FNL Show today, it was just the preview, but it went well.  We got hella people laughing, and hella people were there.  Needless to say, everyone had a good time.  School-in-Action-Night is probubly the best school event we do.  It's the only time I can get heavy RBGness (I forgot to buy a wrist band) and then go hang out with Guild Script kids down the hall.  Great stuff.

      Talked to dad today, guess I got what I wanted to hear.  I guess, sad thing, is now that he explained it, I realized I really can't talk about it, and that most things in life tend to be conspiratol.  Damn.  I could look deeper into it, but trust me, it goes pretty deep.  Hmmm... let's change to philosophy for a second.  I was thinking, as I often do, what's the point of life.  Why did life evolve into progressively more complicated forms.  The easy answer is, our way of thinking is wrong, and that they're less complicated, or something else that wouldn't make sense from our perceptions angle.  But the one that made sense to me, is that everyone wants to be immortal.  That's why single cells multiply, and don't just starve and die off.  Life wants to replicate itself, so that it'll continue forever.  The thing about a single cell is that it's easy to kill.  So I'm assuming cells originally joined together for protection, but in the process they lost themselves as individuals.    So what's the point of that?  Cells could die out, so can more difficult life related things.  So that's why, I think, all life forms are so content on reproducing, the cells want to live on forever.  It's hella more complicated then that, but since all cells descended from the same cell, or cells, it's logical to assume that all living things came from a few cells that wanted to live forever.  Interesting, I guess.   Also, FNL Preview at School in Action Night tommorow.  It's gonna be hot, and they're gonna be mad girls with the fatties and packed booties man.  So come.

      Oye, the security guards really pissed me off today.  Perhaps it's that completely irrational anger, that I'm prone to, but it really bothered me how they not only did the hall sweep, which I got 'caught' in while trying to return to class with my formally lockered text book.    So, white people were freaking out, that the hall sweeps didn't just apply to black people and I was about to get swept up in the hysteria, until I realized it was kind of pointless to be mad at the people doing the hall sweeps, since it wasn't their genius idea, and they wouldn't change anything.  I'm leaving, though, and mr. flatop (who sent me in the office in the first place) starts trying to do his "I was hired cause I'm a scary black dude" thing, and I'm trying to explain to this pendajo that my pass was in my hand, but apparently to him I was only talking back.  Taldy (Tall Bald Security Guard) had to convince him that yes, indeed I was carrying the 8.5x11 piece of yellow paper in my hand.  What a jack ass, but I've had him yelling at me before (for asking questions) funny.  Oh man, and then throughout the day white people are like "Yeah, they bother you cause your black", I find that slightly hard to believe.  I think it's more a matter of, how many black people are around.  We seem to attract trouble in larger numbers, rather then being singled out directly.  But some of the stories people tell me just piss me off, to see how easily white people, hell just about anyone who has few black characteristics, do actually get off the hook with the black security guards.  Now, I don't want to go all Stef (from the Cafeteria incident last year) and call the Security Guards Uncle Toms but something definitely doesn't sit right.  Okay, and my mystery has only gotten more confusing.  It's funny how things in real life tend to as mysterious as they are in fiction.

      Friday is going to suck.   If I remember frosh year for anything, it's that I did stuff.  I seriously never go out on Friday's anymore, it didn't occur to me last year, but it's really bothering me now, because somehow the end of the year brings up this unbearable depression in me.  Whatever.  "Before I blow this verse Let's Explain the name first Ambassador because fame ain't a game no more I be the senior representative that game from abroad Wanderlust inherited from MA to Stuggart State of the art Southern parts To top of the charts Set it off strike target headed straight for your heart Mark my words We got soliders marching in herds Who solved the murder? Condelence to the martyr James Bryd On towards Addis Abbaba to the Badme border area. Black on black wars from Ethiopia to Eritrea." -Freundeskreis "Tabula Rasa"  I'm really feeling more like mobilizing right now, if I could convince anyone to go the Palestinian Meeting that's in Clifton.  Free Palestine, and all that jazz.  I'll just attribute this to end of the year depression, compounded with some other random factors.  Too much work, and all that ish too.  I'll figure out something.

      School, it shows how many oppurtunities that Marcus can squander.  Regardless, I won't dwell on that.  I learn enough in school everyday to make up for things.  First things first, never miss an oppurtunity because you think you may have another one.   The second one is more personal.  I see why it's easier to be friends with girls, and it's not that I'm gay.  I've come to see, that usually guys will inspire each other to act more 'guyish' or 'manish' (I just realized I use 'guy' because 'man' carries alot more weight) while girls of course don't make this happen.  If I was around a lot of girls who were smoking, no desire to smoke even if they were best friends, now if my best guy friends (or any guys I was friendly with) were smoking, you better believe I'd be lighting up! I felt this at lunch today, if I saw a person who liked nice (bangin'?) I'd normally just divert my eyes.  Not at lunch, at lunch it's more of a stare, followed by a coughing, choking (on juice) or screaming (because I scream alot).    On the matter of girls, it's funny the assumptions about race'joe-average-middle-class-black-guy' thinks.  For example, I brought up at lunch, 'aren't black girls assumed to just like black guys more?' Not too irrational, since most black guys are likely married to black girls.  But at the same time, you could point around the table and say "He likes white girls" or "He likes Spanish girls" or "He only likes black girls" It's sort of that double standard thing black people have going on, interesting, right?

      Is it just me, or is driving overly stressful?  Maybe it's just driving with my dad, but it really sucks.  Like today we went to the dump twice, had to wait in line for like an hour.  Then I took the most complicated ways home, just so he could stress out about stress that 'almost happened'.  Definitely not fun, am I strange for not enjoying driving?  No matter.  Thesis paper is bothering me even more.  I'm convinced on the need to change my topic, and just gave up on Native Americans, it's far to late in the year to do this amount of digging for scraps of information to build a thesis paper from.  I'm just throwing in the towel and going to work with black people I guess, I'll dig into the house library, as well as the public one and hopefully make good out of what's good.   What else.... Oh, driving sucks.  I drove to Taco Bell afterwards, sucked.  I drove to Pathmark, sucked even more.  It just isn't cool, it's like convincing myself marching band is fun. haha.

      Another day another dollar.  The thing is, my life isn't particurally interesting.  It is usually most interesting in the time between just before I have a girlfriend, which is only fun in hindsight, to the time where I have the girlfriend, and then the confusion after I break up.  This has really only happened twice, that'd be important, and I can tell I'm getting to the end of the ensuing confusion phase.   I go through a whole pregnancy cycle, re-birth I guess, before I actually start REALLY looking outwards again.  Poetic, yes.  Lauren, oh Lauren, Lauren, Lauren.  Why must you be under so much stress?  I really worry about my cousin dearest.  Holy Demiurge, I guess the Demiurge is holy since he calls himself holy... Whatever, I shouldn't use that phrase.  Great Aeons, Rulers of the Universe! I just realized that BLD (Black Liberation Day) is tommorow as well as Malcolm X's birthday.  I guess that means I'm going to sit outside, or isolate myself somehow, and listen to Malcolm X speak for about 40 minutes.  I won't watch any TV, which means I'll put off watching 'Half-and-Half' until Thursday.  And anyone who laughs at me watching 'Half-and-Half' is wasting their life, Dee-Dee and Mona are both SOOOOOO hot, and they dress so well! Not to mention that everyone the mothers, their occasional boyfriend, Spencer (who Mona is obsessed with but dated this 'older woman' from Britain), I could go on.  The problem is the token gay guy (since it's a black people show, no token black people) is a Filippino who is so overly flagrant, and so unattractive that you really feel sorry for how Asian men get the shaft in the good looks department.  Whatever, I'll ignore the racism for the moment.  Must clear my mind for tommorow.  Ha-Ha.

      Okay I do have something on my mind.  Should I go to Howard?  I know I could get in, and old black women would forever love me.  Is it worth it though?  The thing about black colleges, is they understanbly aren't THAT competitive.  Howard has pretty low admission standard, IMHO, but I'm sure they have quite a few dedicated students.  Is it worth it though?    Gah! That's one I'm never going to be sure about.  My mom was kind of pushing Morehouse though, but that's in Atlanta.  I don't know if I honestly could deal with being in the South, but then again guys who graduate there are bound for success.  Soooo hard to say.

      70. Jesus said, "If you bring forth what is within you, what you have will save you. If you do not have that within you, what you do not have within you [will] kill you."  -Gospel of Thomas  Can't really think of an update, so I'll just leave it at this.  Oh yeah, I don't like Kerry, almost as much as I don't like Bush.  In some ways I'm glad I don't have to give myself up too the two party system since I'll miss the election by 5 months.

      Moammar is my boy, no joke.    It's a shame he's old, because he's one of the greatest world leaders especially when it comes to attracting attention.    Moammar  - We have a nuclear weapons program... UN- Oh my lord, you do! Bush- Let's kill the damn sand niggers! Moammar-...Which we are stopping immedietly in the interest of international peace. UN- Phew! Bush- Yee-haaw! Moammar- And to insure further peace, we encourage the US to follow our example. Bush- What.....  Granted, he financed international terrorism, and blew a plane up over Scotland, but he was younger then.  He was allowed one hot headed action.  But these people who gave AIDs to children.... Ooooh.  I'm so glad they got sentenced to die, hopefully in a very painful way.  Biowar In Africa By AP Newswire,  May 7, 2004   A Libyan court has sentenced five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor to death for infecting hundreds of children with the AIDS virus in an attempt to find a cure for the disease.  Bulgaria condemned the "unfair and absurd" verdicts delivered on Thursday and called for a strong reaction from its Western partners -- the European Union, NATO and the United States. The verdicts will be appealed, defense lawyers said.  The issue is a hurdle to Libya joining the economic Euro-Mediterranean partnership. Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi promised action in the dispute during his ground-breaking visit to the EU headquarters last week, Reuters said.  The health workers, detained in early 1999, were convicted of infecting 426 Libyan children at a Benghazi hospital with blood products contaminated with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.  The court in the town of Benghazi sentenced the five female nurses and a male Palestinian doctor to death by firing squad.  Another Bulgarian doctor, Zdravko Georgiev, was jailed for four years for changing foreign currency on the black market, lawyers said. Court officials had originally said all six Bulgarians received death sentences.  Dr. Georgiev had also stood trial for infecting patients with AIDS, but the verdict did not mention that charge, and no explanation was given for the change.  One defence lawyer told Reuters: "The confusion about the sentences came from the way the judge announced the verdicts."  All six had pleaded innocent, with experts for the defense arguing that poor medical hygiene probably led to the contamination.  The European Union, Amnesty International and other organizations had criticized the case.  Bulgarian Foreign Minister Solomon Pasi claimed the medics were tortured while they were in the custody, according to The Associated Press.  Bulgarians had expected some leniency after Gadhafi's recent efforts to renew ties with the West.  "I'm shocked by the verdicts. The government's official position is that we're not going to accept them. Such verdicts are unfair and without grounds," Bulgarian Justice Minister Anton Stankov told Reuters in Sofia.  "We expect a strong reaction from all our partners, especially the European Union, the United States and NATO, who have all put forth efforts to ensure a fair trial," Stankov said.  In contrast, relatives of the infected children were happy.  "The verdict is fair. What they did is a crime against humanity. They planted a bomb inside our children," Ramdane Ali Mohamed, whose little sister Hiba died of AIDS, told the news agency.  Families of the medics were stunned and unwilling to talk to the media. But Bulgarian Parliament Speaker Ognyan Gerdzhikov said he believed the death sentences would not be carried out.  "First, they can be appealed. Secondly, Libya has not executed death sentences in nine years, and I'd be very surprised if they start now. Thirdly, I expect Gaddafi to act like a humanist to win certain political credit, which he needs from world public opinion," he told national radio.  Libya has recently emerged from international isolation after scrapping its nuclear arms program in December.  It also agreed to pay damages to relatives of passengers killed in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over the Scottish village of Lockerbie and the 1989 bombing of a French airliner.

      I'm an idiot.  I forgot to sign up for the SATI's in June, so I'll have to take them in October (or whenever).  Ehhh, not so much of a problem I guess.  I'm still registered for the SATII's in June, so I'm good.  Ginnene's graduation as I previously mentioned.

      Nia told me this today.  If you ask a black child (and probubly most black people in general) to say a sentence and end it in "I am.." you will usually get the answer "I am black."  She claims this is because black people are always aware that they are black, while white people are not always aware that they are white.  So true.  More on race, I heard Cotter (and Cooper) on npr today.  Cousin, whoes name is French and difficult to spell, is graduating tommorow.  So we are taking a carvan trip down to Delware State to see to her comencement.

      This new format somehow doesn't feel HTML friendly.  Anyway, I just got of this way to long call with Kelly.  Not that talking to Kelly is a problem, it was simply a very long conversation, and it was very enlightening.  You see, Kelly is part of my secret ultra-black people lifestyle, that I secretly hide from everyone else.  We were scheduled to do a Nangila (our test organization) poetry reading on May 29, but we haven't planned.  So Kelz calls Keisha and Quan, and we were talking about it for awhile and eventually we settled on cancelling it.  So Keisha and Quan hung up and me and Kelly were talking.  I'd mentioned to Jodie earlier, that I hadn't talked to Kelly for ages.  She said I should stop being so stoic with Kelly, which Kelly echoed when I was talking to her.  She said I seemed to be in my own cute little box.  Never really thought about that, but I guess it was true, and yes they did use the word stoic.  Sadly, we cancelled the reading, and are also considering just stopping Nangila.  I guess it was a good run, but we aren't the original Nangila people nor do we have the devotion or time necessary to devote to it.  So I guess we're going to put it down.

      Today sucked.  I wanted to call Kelly, but never go around too it.  I woke up at around noon or so.  I still haven't gotten even halfway through the class reading so all tommorow is that book.  Then what else.... saw Van Helsing with my dad.  I'm sooo out of it.  What junior spends their weekend with their dad?  Whatever, the movie sucked too.  That added to the badness factor.  Besides all that depressing stuff, I'm not dead.  So I can't exactly complain.

      I can't stand MTV, hell even Fuse (Fuze) managed to F hip hop up.    I guess it's not fully their fault.  Hip-hop, like all things black people, is confused.  It doesn't know where to go.  Q-Tip had declared Hip Hop dead at one point.  I think it's at more of a singularity, it's changing too fast to understand what's going on with it.  I guess hip-hop's in a dark age, it's renaissance was in '88 and since then it's been in a sharp decline.  Take for example 'sucka free sunday' on MTV.  The whole damn thing is devoted to hip-hop, and it would seem great, especially the best of 'sucka free sunday'.  The host was this reasonable (as I'm talking about just body) looking girl.  Who was reasonably, if archaicly (looked kinda 80's with her shirt and earrings), dressed.  Don't get me wrong though she was really pretty, no perm or any of that straight garbage, I guess I'll call the hair style bi-racial (as in black-white) hair, since that was it's texture.  So she shows all these interviews, says community alot.  Then suddenly it switches to G-Unit.  If you don't know me, then I guess my hatred of G-unit isn't known to you.  50cent was what? A crack dealer?  I mentioned previously that I think all crack dealers should be murdered in the most painful way.  But if that's not bad enough, excuse my language, but this guy goes and niggerizes (oh it's a word) these women in his video.  He has two black girls on a damn leesh, and the whole song is about him being a motherfucking PIMP....  I can't stand that.  I really can't stand treatment of women in rap videos, since it's almost exclusively black women who are having their image torn apart.  What eludes me even more is why the black feminist movement isn't strong at all.  They have plenty to mobilize against, and our community has a huge amount of internal improvement that it needs to go through before we can actually sue for change in the greater society as a whole.  But somehow, the black women in the community don't seem to be attacking the issue hard enough.  Are black women's psyche's that damaged from this attack on their meme complex?

      I'm not feeling like myself.  I didn't want to watch City of God all the way through for the first time in awhile! Could I have watched the movie too many times?  Nah....   Rocket- "I need a joint." Tiago- "Instead of smoking, man, You should snort coke.  It's really far out." Angelica- "You snort Tiago? I prefer a good toke." Rocket- "If you like I can get it for you." Tiago  - "You can? Well go on. Move your ass." Tiago- "But the choice stuff is coke. That's a real nercotic." Rocket and Angelica- "Narcotic!"  It's really funyn because in portugese he says  "intoxin" or something like that and Angelica and Rocket are like "Intoxico!" Haha.  And it's even better because Tiago is seriously high through the entire movie.  It's even better because seriously, that movie makes you want to smoke weed, EVERYONE and I do mean EVERYONE smoked weed in that movie.  Rocket and his friend (Stringy?) hitch hiked with this guy from Sao Paulo, and he gave them weed.  Rocket went home with this lady she smoked weed.  Angelica smoked weed.  The Tender Trio smoked weed.  Carrot Smoked Weed.  Blacky smoked weed.  Li'l Dice smoked weed.  Everyone in that movie smoked weed, except the hot girl in the bakery who they only showed for like 2 seconds, but I'm sure she smoked weed on the weekends.  Ain't it funny?

      Idris' xanga is really well written.  Brutally honest, but the way he writes is slightly humorous.  Good stuff.  USAP test today.  I'm not gonna front and say it was easy, but I hadn't expected that.  Nor am I going to say it was hard.  Most people freaked out about it, and were happy when it was simple.  Me, I hadn't expected much, and got something.  Not to bad though, I kind of lost my will to write by the last essay.  People were overjoyed about the DBQ though.  I guess that's enough though.  I don't need ETS coming after me.  Let's see, what else?    Ooh colleges.  I think I may just apply to Howard (The #2 best Historically Black College in my opinion second only to Spelman/Morehouse (since they are ladies and men only respectively) to see if I can get in.  The only problem is, to accomodate to most black people who desire to go their the standards are lower to get in, because they want to attract as many black people of all intellectual and social standings to hopefully create the New Black Generation.  I guess they succeeded too, my great-grandfather (my Grammy's father) graduated from Howard and went on to become a doctor.  One of the first black doctors too, and during the depression.  Does that make me a Bougie Negro?  But besides that, where I want to go-  1. NYU 2. UVA 3. U. SoCal (yeah right) 4. UMD 5. Loyola 6. Rutgers 7. Cornell (or any of those 'last name' schools in NY)

      I don't know how to explain it, but I looked at some old pictures of people.  It's like, some proof that you've grown older but it's hard to nail down.  I call it 'hardening of features'.  It happend to alot of people from 8th or 9th grade up until now.  I can't explain it though, it's just creepy to look at old pictures of people and see that process had happened.

      Perception is really everything.  Yo, Samone was telling me an anecdote today, and it really made me depressed.  I don't know.... Life's a bitch and it's too short I guess.  But at the same time, I guess we'd never be happy if we couldn't be majorily depressed.    Just rambling.

      "Dude Marcus you have abs, you should tottally be getting laid!" -Emma after I proved that yes, I still do have abs.  I just thought that was funny.  I didn't really have much of a response either.  I read on the DPZ board some guys set of morals and I basically took those as gospel.  One of them was "No promiscuous sex" and he explained it, and I saw the logic in that.    Which I thought was funny.  Since most of my friends are virgins regardless, I still somehow feel the peer pressure "have sex" meme.  Funny.

      I'm about to set it off society, watch me while I do it.  If you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem.  So many drugs.  I really can't stand drugs.  I can pretend to think of all the coolness in Poua, Liquid Gold, and Duji, but it's all a lie.  I can say that maybe some pharmaceutical drugs that are purely chemical, and not physically addictive aka Liquid Gold (Poppers), aren't as bad, but still they are horrible.  They ruin people, and the people they don't ruin end up usually ruining someone else.  Let's start with an example.  Heroin dealers are the scum of the earth.  Any human being that would willingly sell heroin to someone else, deserves to be murdered in the most painful way possible.  Then you have crack dealers, for those who don't know crack is like a bit of Coke mixed with a base... I'm assuming Baking Soda.  Crack is cheaper then ciggarettes in some respects, but VERY addictive.  It's common among urban poor black people, although when it first appeared in the mid to late 80's it was the biggest thing ever.  Quite a few rappers got their start in Crack, and it was basically cool to sell it, but not to use it. As I said, crack dealers are almost on par with heroin dealers.  Then we have the less bad people.  People who sell weed.  Americans who sell weed from a really far off source are usually just in it for money.  But Weed is terrible to grow, second only to growing Coke.  Weed makes farmers in South America, grow it rather then food because of it's huge demand world wide.  It kills soil, and since the people rarely rotate crops huge tracts are rainforest are torn down.  Weed trade in the United States might be light, but too the people South of us who are involved with it's direct production... It's not a game.  I don't know why I just typed all of this.  It's impossible to change any pot heads mind, and since their are so many of them, who I see every day, and act like are so normal, I guess I'm being a hypocrite.  Oh well.

      "Red Mars" by Kim Stanley Robinson.    I've been reading alot more "hard-sci-fi" recently.  I guess I got sick of always reading about religion.    Anyway, this book is about the first people to travel to Mars to colonize it.  It starts of in 2026, and although the technology doesn't seem to have advanced all that much (the book was made in 1993) it has quite a few interesting things.  First, the book is hyper-realistic.  The way Robinson describes Mars, he makes it seem like your actually their.  This was before we were positive that life lived on Mars though, but besides this minor faux-pas which brings you back to reality, he'll say things like "we never knew about these things from Space".    What's even color is that the book shows Stanley's view of the future of humanity.  He basically believes, one can assume from his book, that people are the only form of intelligent life that is relevant to us.  So it's our job to spread around the entire universe, and create life in worlds that are largely dead.  Very interesting stuff.  I'm not even up to the part where they start to Terraform mars yet.  I hadn't thought I'd enjoy the book, but I think I'm going to buy the follow ups of "Green Mars" and "Blue Mars".

      I get bored way to easily.  I suppose that's a problem of mine.  I'm feeling depressed, because I feel I have nothing to do.  So the only things that leaves me to do is try to find an identity, which never works, which leaves me feeling more depressed.    The worst part about it, is it's not even normal depression.  It's like this mild empty feeling I get in my stomach.  Maybe it's also because I'm tired, because whenever I feel like that it usually goes away by the next time I'm in school.  Maybe it's the repressed virgin in me crying out in pain? Haha. Yeah, that's a good way to view depression.

      "Light and Darkness, life and death, right and left, are brothers of one another. They are inseparable. Because of this neither are the good good, nor evil evil, nor is life life, nor death death. For this reason each one will dissolve into its earliest origin. But those who are exalted above the world are indissoluble, eternal." -The Gospel According to Phillip  It's not that I'm anti-religious.  I think I have the mind of an Atheist, but the soul of a Saint.  I hate religion because of what it does to people, but I hate people who aren't religious because I find them ignorant.  I suppose that's because I've yet to meet anyone who thinks like me in the least.  But who would?  I change between all sorts of fringe religious beliefs like they're clothes.  I guess I realized that sitting in church, a very interesting situation, or when that black lady I helped Friday said "Keep going to church."    Maybe it's not even that.  I guess I don't hate what religion does to people, I hate what religion does to black people.  Yeah, that's more to the point.  I can't shake the concept that religion, actually Christianity, is nothing more then a slave religion.  I remember I was talking to Kelz and she said one of her friends worships her ancestors, and I was thinking "Far out, some kids still do have some sense." I really don't know though, I haven't really thought all day.  I've just labored for school, and for the household, and slept.  I still have another 40 note cards to do, but I'm not sure I want to do them.  I woke up in the middle of the night scared shitless about the Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  I think that's pretty damn funny, it didn't do shit until I woke up at 5AM, and just thought about stupid white people being murdered because they were stupid in that movie.  Then I thought about a million other things, and I felt worse/better.  Haha.  All I can say is that after this week, I will do something so horribly stupid that the rest of my life will pale in comparisson.

      Just saw Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003).  Meh.  Besides the fact it's late at night and I'm sitting alone in my basement, it really wasn't a scary movie.  Well, it WAS scary, but it was soooo slasherish and had all the crappy things in it.  I figure that black people (or Iroquois!) must have come up with slashers.  They make white people into the dumbest things alive.  At one point, I stopped even trying to feel fear because this girl was so fucking dumb.  Whatever, she gets cool points because she hot wired a car.

      At the moment I'm sick, but unfortunately still can't miss work.    Today was an interesting first day. At the start of the day Mike and Katie, the directors, told us to come up with an all camp signal to get everyones attention.  The Pre-K lady had given crazy ideas at staff training on Thursday, but they were very childish to an extent that was... umm... silly?  So anyway, Micah comes up with one.  He says to us says "Let's do the Li'l John thing." So Mitchell, one of the head counselors (shannon is the other), says that's pretty cool.  Only Cameron could make that into something rated G.  It's really funny because the little kids loved it.  Later in the day at the park when we Mitchell screams "YEAHHHH!" All the little kids said "OKAY!!!"and ran to their counselors.  Only us.  Only us.  Best thing about the job is being with people my own age.  The average age is 17.  The youngest is 16, and the oldest is 19 or 22 (I didn't hear Christine when she said her age).  So yeah, it's all good, except the bad things.  75 kids in one place is a bad thing.  15 kids between me and Camille is also a bad thing.

      I took a 7 hour course today at the Baird Center.  I learned how to do CPR, use an AED and provide basic first aid, and am now certified.  It was soo long and drawn out though, with me and all the other counselors over 17 (me and this girl I don't really know from school were the only people who were actually 17).  It was still pretty cool, I got to bond with alot of people I wouldn't usually talk to.  It seems like Monday is going to be some good stuff, hopefully.  Anything else?....  Fox has me watching it again.  The Simple Life 2, is definitely a guilty pleasure.  Besides, Nicole (who is bi-racial) looks like my Cousin Sara.  I'll find a good picture of just Sara sometime, and post it and then one of Nicole.  It's kinda eerie.    Then Method and Red, I really like that show.  It makes fun of it's own black ignorance by making it insanely opulent.  They had a champagne cooler (like a water cooler) with disposable cups (which were really goblets spackled with rubies).  And they have an obsession with Asian women, that's funny too.  And Method man's mom lives in the house with them.  It's really a much better show then I thought it'd be.  It's already had two episodes, and a third one is planned for next week.  It might have staying power.

      Mass Incarceration And Rape By Blackcommentator.com,  June 21, 2004   Mass incarceration is by far the greatest crisis facing Black America, ultimately eclipsing all others. It is an overarching reality that colors and distorts every aspect of African American political, economic and cultural life, smothering the human  and humane  aspirations of the community. Even the boundless creativity of youth cannot escape the chains that stretch from the Gulag into virtually every Black social space. We hear prison, talk prison, wear prison and  to a horrific degree  have become inured to the all-enveloping presence of prison in virtually every Black neighborhood and extended family.   After more than three decades of mass Black incarceration as national policy, Black America teeters at the edge of an abyss, unable to muster more than a small fraction of its collective energies to advance its agenda in housing, employment and education. The community has been poisoned by massive, ever increasing infusions of the prison experience  a debasement that now permeates much of the fabric of Black life.   Yet mass Black incarceration is not a political priority for much of what passes for Black leadership. A deep and historical current in Black America feels far more shame than anger at the ever lengthening line of march through the prison gates. For others, the incremental blending of community and prison through the constant human traffic between the two, seems like a natural state of affairs. Associate Editor Bruce A. Dixon writes:   Much as black Americans of two and three generations ago adjusted to pervasive segregation as a normal condition of life, many in our communities have learned to treat the phenomenon of mass incarceration like we do the weather. It's hot in the summer, cold in the winter, and a third of the black males between 18 and 30 are in jails and prisons, on parole or probation. It's life. Get over it.   When Black anger does erupt, it is too often directed only at those who are already paying for having been caught up in the induction mechanisms of the Prison Nation. Although it is true that few inmates are political prisoners in the narrow sense of the term, Americas rise as the worlds prison superpower was certainly the result of calculated political decision-making. Mass incarceration was the national response to the Civil Rights and Black Power Movements, a white societal reaction to Black intrusions onto white space, wrote , March 18. White society clearly approves of the results: massively disproportionate Black and Latino incarceration.   Since 1971, U.S. prisons and jails have grown ten-fold  from less then 200,000 inmates to 2.1 million  while whites have dwindled to only 30 percent of the prison population. With only five percent of the worlds people, the U.S. accounts for 25 percent of the planets prisoners  fully half of them Black. One out of eight prisoners on Earth is African American. Thats race politics with a vengeance.   The U.S. broke with historical patterns of incarceration  a little over 100 prisoners per 100,000 population  in the mid-Seventies. Then, with roughly equal fervor, Presidents Reagan, Bush, Sr. and Clinton and each of the states methodically assembled the worlds largest Gulag. As the Justice Policy Institute reported in 2001, the Black prison population exploded.   From 1980 to 1992, the African American incarceration rate increased by an average of 138.4 per 100,000 per year. Still, despite a more than doubling of the African American incarceration rate in the 12 years prior to President Clintons term in office, the African American incarceration rate continued to increase by an average rate of 100.4 per 100,000 per year. In total, between 1980 and 1999, the incarceration rate for African Americans more than tripled from 1156 per 100,000 to 3,620 per 100,000.   The Institute notes that, In 1986 and 1988, two federal sentencing laws were enacted that made the punishment for distributing crack cocaine 100 times greater than the punishment for powder cocaine. No, Black crack dealers and users are not political prisoners  but they are imprisoned for long stretches and in huge numbers for what are clearly political reasons.   Unless there exists a Black prison gene, politics is the reason that 12 percent of African-American men ages 20 to 34 are in jail or prison. The evidence is irrefutable: mass incarceration of African Americans is national policy.   Last month the U.S. Justice Department announced that the U.S. incarceration rate had risen to 715 per 100,000  up from 703 the previous year, and seven-times the levels that existed before mass incarceration of Blacks became national policy. Crime rates remain historically low  a disconnect that Attorney General John Ashcroft rationalized, this way: "It is no accident that violent crime is at a 30-year low while prison population is up. Violent and recidivist criminals are getting tough sentences while law-abiding Americans are enjoying unprecedented safety."   Thus, the engines of mass Black incarceration keep turning, faster and faster every year, whether crime is up or down. The only constant: more Blacks in prison.   Misplaced Rage   National policies are far more powerful than conspiracies, which tend to die with the men who hatch them. The U.S. policy to imprison ever higher proportions of the Black population, is open-ended  there appears to be no limit. Yet, as the incarceration machinery grinds away at Black society, internal voices full of hatred for other Black people join the racists in turning reality on its head, blaming African American culture for the relentless warehousing of Black men, women and juveniles. Clearly, the reverse is true: prison has worked its corrosive effects on Black culture.   African American culture has been profoundly victimized by three decades of mass incarceration. This is largely the fault of those Blacks who failed (or refused) for all these years to mount sufficient political resistance to the prison body-snatchers. It is both cruel and redundant to heap more scorn on people who are, quite literally, besieged by a hostile state.   By the mid-Eighties, only a (culturally) blind person could have failed to see that the prison experience had reached critical mass among Black youth in Americas big cities. The ill-fitting pants without belts, the unlaced or lace-less footgear  that was the culturally shared prison experience, manifesting. The hip hop sensibility cannot be separated from the pervasiveness of prison  its presence in ghetto life. It is the now-inescapable influence  the logical cultural product of objective facts.   Many of the same Black opinion-molders who ignored (or even encouraged) the states criminalization of entire neighborhoods, in favor of celebrating the escape of people like themselves from these neighborhoods, now express shock at the crudity, violence and raw aggression of some hip hop performers on- and off-stage behavior. Lyrical misogyny is blamed on failures of parenting and other deviations from traditional Black culture. Preaching and moralizing is prescribed, rather than a race-wide mobilization against a state policy of mass Black incarceration, the primary vector of Black street culture.   There is much more horror in the prison pipeline, which empties directly into the reservoir of Black life. Self-righteous howls of indignation at the warping of Black culture are irrelevant to the millions of African Americans who have been made witness, victim or perpetrator of rape  a near-universal experience in the Black American Gulag. In such a world, everything and everyone is a bitch.   Prison Rape Pervasive   At least 90% of assaults are not even reported to staff. The units with the younger offenders seem to carry by far the higher rates of sexual assaults.  Texas inmate R.B. to Human Rights Watch   I have seen or heard of rapes on a weekly basis at the least. Mostly it is a daily occurrence. Rapes are a very common occurrence due to the fact of coercion being "played" on ignorant first timers. Once someone is violated sexually and there is no consequences on the perpetrators, that person who was violated then becomes a mark or marked. That means he's fair game.  Indiana inmate M.B.   Each year, hundreds of thousands of young Black men and boys (and record numbers of women and girls) are immersed in the most intensely coercive environment imaginable. Older inmates and ex-prisoners uniformly report that prison rape has become exponentially more prevalent, with gangs dominating the closed world behind the bars. Human Rights Watch activist and lawyer Joanne Mariner, writing in FindLaw, reported extraordinary levels of sexual assault.   In December 2000, the Prison Journal published a study of inmates in seven men's prison facilities in four states. It found that 21 percent of the inmates had experienced at least one episode of pressured or forced sexual contact since being incarcerated, and nearly one out of ten had been raped.   An earlier study of the Nebraska prison system produced similar findings, with 22 percent of male inmates reporting that they had been pressured or forced to have sexual contact against their will while incarcerated. Of these, over 50 percent had submitted to forced anal sex at least once.   Mariner spent three years soliciting over a thousand letters about rape from prison inmates, which she compiled in a book, No Escape: Male Rape in U.S. Prisons. Human Rights Watch and Stop Prison Rape found allies in strange places  among white Southern Baptists, born again Watergate convict Charles Colson, and the rightwing Hudson Institute. In the end, a coalition of 32 groups, ranging from the NAACP to the National Council of La Raza and the National Association of Evangelicals, won congressional passage of the Prison Rape Elimination Act, signed into law by President Bush last September.   Pat Nolan, Vice President of former Nixon aide Charles Colsons Prison Fellowship, wrote:   "For too long prison rape has been accepted as a normal part of prison life, subjecting inmates, many of them nonviolent offenders, to brutal and repeated rapes that not only scar them physically and emotionally for life but in many cases expose them to AIDS, with a resulting death sentence. No crime, no matter how terrible, carries a sentence of rape."   The legislation provides $40 million in grants for rape prevention  the bulk of which are likely to be awarded to religious groups associated with the bills conservative supporters  authorizes a Department of Justice panel to subpoena officials at prisons with high sexual assault rates, and creates an independent, nine-person commission on prison rape. The Department of Justice in March released a report on its preliminary discussions for implementing the legislation.   For all its good intentions, however, the bill is ill-equipped to deal with the prison rape horror.   The same congressional conservatives who embraced the Prison Rape Elimination Act in 2003, were also responsible for passage in the Nineties of legislation that effectively denied prison inmates access to the federal courts. They can be abused, tortured, raped without effective recourse to law, said Anthony Lewis, in an April, 2001 column:   One statute bars poverty lawyers who get federal funds from representing prisoners. Another sets the fees so low for private lawyers who sue successfully that few can afford to take on prison cases.   Harshest of all is the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1996, passed by a Republican Congress and signed by President Clinton. Among other things it requires prisoners to exhaust a prison's administrative remedies for mistreatment before they can sue. They may have as little as five days to do that; they may not know how, and they may face retaliation if they complain. If they fail that barrier, they have waived their rights.   Without basic constitutional rights, inmates remain at the mercy of the prison bureaucracy  the very men who oversee and orchestrate the barbarity.   Lords Of Discipline   They wanted to humiliate us. It was disgusting. They covered our heads with plastic bags and hit our backs with sharp objects, which added to our wounds. They then took off all our clothes, made us stand next to the wall and carried out immoral acts that I cannot even talk about. Women soldiers took pictures of naked men and did not care.  Iraqi former prisoner Hashim Muhsin, speaking to Al Jazeera   Charles was just filled with the glee of opportunity to go over there, because he said as we're walking down the corridor, "I can't wait to go kill some sand niggers." That smile he showed, he showed best when he was getting some prisoner to lose it, to snap, to lose his mind and scream at Charles. He loved it.  Former death row inmate Nicholas Yarris, recalling to CNN his memories of prison guard Charles Graner, later charged with abusing prisoners at Abu Ghraib.   Texas prison inmates continue to live in fear. More vulnerable inmates are raped, beaten, owned, and sold by more powerful ones. Despite their pleas to prison officials, they are often refused protection. Instead, they pay for protection, in money, services, or sex.  Texas Judge William Wayne Justice, after hearing lengthy expert and inmate testimony on prison conditions.   The Black clergy did not take the lead in championing the Prison Rape Elimination Act. And it was factors wholly external to the African American community  the Iraqi prisoner abuse scandal  that indirectly brought media attention to the savagery of U.S. prisons, where the Iraq malefactors learned their psycho-sexual torture skills.   In a May 8 New York Times article, Fox Butterfield drew a direct line between Abu Ghraib and the American Gulag.   In Pennsylvania and some other states, inmates are routinely stripped in front of other inmates before being moved to a new prison or a new unit within their prison. In Arizona, male inmates at the Maricopa County jail in Phoenix are made to wear women's pink underwear as a form of humiliation.   At Virginia's Wallens Ridge maximum security prison, new inmates have reported being forced to wear black hoods, in theory to keep them from spitting on guards, and said they were often beaten and cursed at by guards and made to crawl.   Fellow Timesman Bob Herbert, in a May 31 column, described a 1996 Georgia Department of Corrections raid on inmates' living quarters at Dooly State Prison:   Officers opened cell doors and ordered the inmates, all males, to run outside and strip. With female prison staff members looking on, and at times laughing, several inmates were subjected to extensive and wholly unnecessary body cavity searches. The inmates were ordered to lift their genitals, to squat, to bend over and display themselves, etc.   One inmate who was suspected of being gay was told that if he ever said anything about the way he was being treated, he would be locked up and beaten until he wouldn't want to be gay anymore. An officer who was staring at another naked inmate said, I bet you can tap dance. The inmate was forced to dance, and then had his body cavities searched. An inmate in a dormitory identified as J-2 was slapped in the face and ordered to bend over and show himself to his cellmate. The raiding party apparently found that to be hilarious.   Scenes of Iraqi torture miraculously gave media credibility to long-ignored pleas for justice in the U.S. prison system. The Newark Star Ledger gave space to a letter from Bonnie Kerness, of the Quakers Prison Watch Project:   The children in juvenile detention facilities talk about being physically and sexually abused. They tell us that children as young as 12 are placed in isolation, with one youngster noting that the guards call you names. If they dont physically abuse you, they mentally abuse you. One guard was calling me names and I didnt even know what they meant. Another said, two guards in intake told me to strip naked and then they watched me. Another talked about being 14 years old when he was placed in the hole where it was freezing and dirty.   We hear from women in prisons testifying about being forced to engage in sexual acts or as one woman put it, this was not part of my sentence to engage in oral sex. Another woman wrote that the guards sprayed me with pepper spray because I wouldnt take my clothes off in front of five male guards. The women report racism, being beaten and being gynecologically examined every time Im searched.   We hear from men who have been sprayed with pepper spray and then put out into the sun so the chemical agent continues to re-activate. One letter from a social worker to us said, John was directed to leave the strip cell and a urine soaked pillow case was placed over his head. He was walked, shackled and hooded to a different cell where he was placed in a device called the chair, where he was kept for over 30 hours resulting in extreme physical and emotional suffering. I am currently working with a number of people who have been held in sensory deprivation cells in American prisons for over 20 years!   The plight of Iraqis, who will one day soon be rid of their racist, exually twisted American guards, inadvertently invigorated discussion of American prison practices. It took an international spotlight on Iraq to shed temporary light on an American story that is older than the nation, itself  as old as slavery.   Prison Teaches "Assertiveness"   As Philip Weiss wrote in the June 17 issue of the New York Observer, prison rape is deeply ingrained in the culture, and were all inured to it. Theres contempt for prisoners, and its also a hugely uncomfortable topic for men to think about."   More accurately, white society considers Black prisoners to be animals beyond the reach of civilization. In the popular imagination, prison rape is what happens to white boys unfortunate enough to wind up behind bars despite the odds. In reality, since rape is a tool of coercion, every prisoner is vulnerable  and every inmate is deeply harmed by his/her experience in such an environment.   The American prison system is a vast enterprise in social engineering  it turns out damaged people. Arizona prison warden Bill Gaspar is truly a mad social scientist. The threat of rape has a salutary effect, in his mind:   "All inmates face a challenge when they come to prison. They're coming to an environment where they have to learn how to carry themselves so that they don't present as victims or in some way call attention to themselves."   The warden thinks prison teaches inmates to assert themselves.   Some liberal politicians share the same worldview as the troglodytes, regarding prison rape. California Attorney General Bill Lockyer wants to punish Enrons Ken Lay for bilking the state of billions in electricity overcharges. "I would love to personally escort Lay to an 8-by-10 cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says, 'Hi, my name is Spike, honey.'" The states top law enforcement officer approves of nonjudicial punishment by rape.   The words cruel and unusual do not exist for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. Human Rights Watch prisons activist Joanne Mariner writes:   Justice Thomas apparently believes that rape in prison is inevitable. In his dissent [to a 1994 decision], he stated that "[p]risons are necessarily dangerous places; they house society's most antisocial and violent people in close proximity with one another. Regrettably, some level of brutality and sexual aggression among [prisoners] is inevitable no matter what the guards dounless all prisoners are locked in their cells 24 hours a day and sedated."   Consumed By Prison   Youth are not at fault for the social disarray in Black America. Young people in all cultures cope with society as it is presented to them. Black youth  male and female  face a state that is eager to consume them in its criminalizing, mass Black incarceration machinery. The only meaningful choice available is to organize as never before to dismantle the savage machine, so that another generation will not be irrevocably damaged. Young people by the millions would join in such a mobilization  to save themselves.   It has been projected that, by 2010, the number of Americans with experience in prison will rise to 7.7 million, up from 5.6 million in 2003. About 4 million of them will be African American  unless we stop the clock through concerted political action.

      La 'ila la'llah  Today was insane.  Degrassi on Friday was also insane.  Jimmy is finally going out with Hazel though, does that prove A. being politcally correct by having the two black people date or B. even when they are in a horrible minority people of the same race always seem to be attracted to each other.  Beyond the point, Teri got knocked into a coma.  How's that for a plot twist?  And I'm rambling to all you losers who don't watch Degrassi.  So we have the graduation thing at church.  This dude B. Smith graduated.  I always sat behind him in church and wondered how old he was.  He really looks different.  The the eccentric Kevin Grant, who already knows Chinese, Japanese, French and German.  He spent a year in Germany (sophmore year?).  Completely insane.  Then the lovely Farrah, Nefertiti, and LaDonna were graduating as well.  Sad to see them go.  Insha'llah.  We went to this ultra posh resturant for Father's day.  The bill was over 700 dollars for 12 people, but I suppose it was worth it for the rich people food at The Manor.  My dad over indulged in Oysters saying they are really expensive, I had one.  It tasted like I remembered, like seawater.  More rich people food, and 2 hours later everyone is full so we returned home.  Dad says "Oh no, I left my bag at the place, Marcus come on, I need you to run inside!"  I sighed, a trek back to west orange.  So we get off 280 and stop at a light. My dad jumps out of the car in the middle of the street and is like "you drive!" so I quickly try to change the seat into a more comfortable posistion and all that jazz.  Then we drive off.  We get to the place, and my dad tells me to stop in an awkward place in the parking lot, and then runs inside.  So one of the guys is like "move your car more over there." So, I'm thinking, I'm about to break the law by driving without my dad in the car, but hell this guy doesn't know that.  So I pull across the parking lot no prob.  Dad comes back we do the long drive home (he was convinced going down northfield with me would be easier then going down 280, and considering how absent minded I am I suppose he was right).  Now he says I'll be driving part way to MV this summer.... GAH!!! It'll be like 2AM and I'll be 'shit-ass-tired'.  Whatever, as long as he brings the wireless card, I can use the 'net when he's driving.

      Chumvi Mtembezi- Swahili for a Pinch of salt.  I need my life to have a pinch of salt in it.  For the past few months my computer has been fucked up, to say the least.  It was only yesterday (actually Friday, since it's technically Sunday) when trying to figure out what was wrong with my network connection, that my dad realized he needed to fix this computer.  So blah blah blah, 40 some odd hours later, I have XP installed on this computer.  The internet still wasn't up, dad claimed some problems still existed, notably no virus scan! So I waited until he went up to plug in the network cable.  Here I am.  School's out.  Work starts soon.  It'll be alot more serious then last year *sigh*, and I'm working at a camp with freakin' 75 kids.  That'll be stressful, unless that hot girl from last year is working there, then it'll be much less stressful.  On the issue of stress.... Today I had to help down take down our (being me and Nia's) old treehouse.  It was backbreaking work with a reciprocating saw and a ratchet wrench.  He offered to take me to a movie afterward, but that mentally and physically drained me.  I didn't even go to the concert at the Baird Center (no major loss Samone said she was outta town).  So here I am at the moment, tried and about to go to sleep.

      I'm avoiding doing work, and feeling Transhumanist again (perhaps a Transhuman is above doing work?) so I spent more time on my favorite place in the Universe (that isn't religious, unless you consider secular humanism a religion) Anders Transhuman Page! Fuck you last page of a the thesis paper! Foxwoods can wait!  "Memetics is the study of ideas and concepts viewed as "living" organisms, capable of reproduction and evolution in an "Ideosphere" (similar to the Biosphere) consisting of the collective of human minds. Memes reproduce by spreading to new hosts, who will spread them further (typical examples are jokes, catchphrases or politicial ideas).   At present memetics is somewhat controversial. Partly this is due to misunderstandings about what it means, leading to claims that it excludes human free will, creativity and progress, and that it is bad science. This will likely change in time, as the field matures." -Anders Transhuman Page  It's really funny because Snow Crash was written about memetic warfare, but they never called it that.  Snow Crash, in the book, was a religion, a virus, and a computer virus.  No to mention it was also a drug, I believe.    I guess the paragraph explains itself, except the point about it claiming people have free will.  Silly modern science, thinking we have free will.  I'm going to go laugh at all people who think we have free will right now. Then I'm going to listen to Dead Prez sing "Everywhere the white man go, he bring misery, allthroughtout history, look it up."  Then I'm going to try to finish my thesis paper.  Stop working for a few hours, and then do Journalism.

      "I will live forever, or die trying.  One of the most important tasks of Transhumanism is the pursuit of Life Extension and eventual immortality, since aging and death represents are two of the most immediate hinders for total self-transformation and personal freedom. Overcoming death is also a social and psychological problem, since most of human culture is based on the assumption of the eventual death of every person. A final argument for the pursuit of Life Extension and Cryonics is that many of the visions of Transhumanism will probably not be possible within our (unaugumented) lifetimes." -Anders Transhumanism Page  "Red Mars" touches on this concept.  It doesn't deal with it in the Transhuman context directly.  So living forever sounds good, but it has some unintended consequences.  Even without trying too, most people who read this can expect to live well into their 80's, and by 2060 or 2070, does it seem impossible that people would be living to be 100?  Doesn't that mean those people were born in the  1960's and 1970's !   Rambling... I'll post more thoughts later.

      What a day.  Let's start it from it's earliest.  I woke up to my mom saying "Help my move this piece!" She was reffering to moving stuff around in her room, it ends up she wanted to change the furniture arangement and needed me and Nia to help.  We did it mostly without big burly man's help, by that I mean my dad.  Next, I go on the computer briefly but then my dad decides to clean out the garage.  That's only like three years of visible garbage (fortunately we ran out of storage space only three years ago), unfortunately my dad has the psychological disorder where he can't throw away any of his stuff.  That was pretty infuriating, and besides that I tend to get mad at him way to easily.  On my part, I suppose that's unfair.  So my mom is able to convince him to make me stop working so I can get some stuff for Tatiana's party that night.  So we go out to Joy-see Gardens (Me, Nia, Dad, and Grammy).  Mom explains her fight with Lauren escalating to me, really annoying stuff.  At the mall, mom is about to buy me two shirts, but dad is adamant against it "Why are we buying shirts here?" "Because I like them, dad." "No, we're going to Burlington Coat Factory."  Okay that was a little weird, but mom says to me says "Don't fight with him about it, he hates not being incharge."  So we go to Burlington Coat Factory.  After some fussing around this Indian guy, who must have been ultra-Dravidian because he looked completely black down to the bone structure until he talked, took my measurements.  Then I go find some nice shirts, my dad is insistent I pick more then one.  Then I get some pants.  Easy enough. Bought him his father's day gift early.  We needed to go to Short Hills for a gift certificate though.  So that was another trek.  We quickly buy the certificate and leave for home.  Things got weird once I got home.  My dad seriously picked out which clothes I was wearing, and it took my forever to convince him against it.  So after that, I felt kinda weird, he's never cared that much about me going to a party in the past.  At the party.  Tatiana's Ethiopian family *drool*.  Food, I really only had the sea food, and salad but it was tre yum.  We were at the Essex House in, to quote Kelz, Wo-Town.  It was pretty calm at first, some music from all over the ethnic and genre spectrum playing.  A few people were dancing not to a huge amount of black people there.  Still, awkward, I don't much like to dance.  So I sat around looking weird for awhile, and danced very little.  Haha, and the only reason I danced is because so few black people were there, I knew I wouldn't be heckled.  Haha.  Yeah, I need to learn the word for fear of new social situations.  That's me mos def.  But yeah, party was pretty cool, I'll upload the few good pictures I took tommorow.  Also, I have to prep for finals.  Robles is out to get me, so I have a shitload of stuff to do for his freakin' final.

      The thing that kills me when I imagine life in a few years is how I'll really see how race plays a major factor after college.   It's not so much a direct thing about racism either.  People usually talk about Irvington, Newark, and sometimes East Orange (hell even Orange!) in tones that lead you to think they are some of the roughest towns in the country (while in reality they may be the toughest in... the county! harharhar).  So, assuming I'm not married by the time I'm 25 (I do intend to get married younger then my dad did, which was 27), actually let me rephrase that, assuming I'm not married to a non-black person, I really KNOW I'm going to be living in a place like that.  My mom was explaining the whole process, she grew up in Maplewood and her and her other black friends from Maplewood went through the same process.  Get out of college, move to Newark/East Orange/Irvington or some other black people enclave, then work your way out and move to South Orange, West Orange, Somewhere else in Newark/East Orange, or Montclair.  It's a really interesting process, and hopefully it'll keep me from falling into the rut that alot of kids who live a life of privelege fall into (which is the slap in the face after college when you need to try and maintain your old lifestyle).    Infact, I'm willing to bet most black people's parents lived elsewhere before they moved to South Orange or Maplewood.  Anyone wanna take me up on that?

      First off, let me shout out to Laura.  I admire her life resembling 'I Love Lucy' except her parents have two lovely kids, her mom doesn't have red hair, and they are neo-conservatives.  But besides that, they're pretty similar.  Memory-  Another one about camp.  Sneaking out, is more or less a rite of passage at camp.  It's something the oldest seniors are almost expected to do.  I hear people do this at all boys camps, or all girls camps, but I think the meaning of it is lost then.  The whole reason we'd do it would be to get girls, usually not to do anything other then talk on our cabins porch (the Senior boys had a Cabin that was on a hill, so it's entrace had stairs leading up to it.  At the top of the stairs was 'The Porch' which younger kids weren't allowed on.).  I'd never done it before one night, but Adam (Coney Island, son) convinced me to come out one night.  Fun stuff, what can I say.  He first showed me the art of actually getting a girl to come out of her cabin, you'd do this complicated lookout thing as you quietly moved into the well lit girls unit (I swear they used halogen lights).  You'd carefully sneak into the cabin, tap who you wanted to wake up, hoping you remembered their bed right, hoping they didn't make any loud noises, and then quietly sneak out.  But regardless, Adam is showing me as he gets this one girl up, I think it was Aurellia, the Italian bombshell who somehow had a mom that lived in South Orange, and a dad that lived in Italy.  I could rave about how hot she was, because her image is forever etched in my mind, but that's beyond the point.  So Adam is like "Marcus, go get Fran."  So I try to play it off cool, but I was soo nervous.  I sneak into the cabin, people asleep all around me, I narrowly avoid knocking their fan over.  I look over at the counselor's bunk, she's asleep.  I tap Fran.  "Fran... Fran...Wanna sneak out?"  She mumbles something in a semi-groggy haze, but get's her shoes on and walks out.  Easy right?  We walk back to our cabin, since this wasn't a planned makeout night, I have a sad story about that *sobsob*.  So we go up to the porch, talking commences, around 3 or 4 AM we start to see what might be light in the sky, so we take the girls back to their cabin, and that was it.  I snuck out maybe two more times, but the year after that somehow it lost it's appeal.  I guess the adrenaline made it worth it.

      I just pulled a hair out from under my chin, I didn't even know I had hair growing under my chin.  About an hour ago, I pulled this stray hair (whisker?) from my sideburns (or the fuzz that passes for sideburns).  So annoying, because I'll just poke and prod long hairs on my fair until they come out.  I'M ADDICTED TO THE PAIN!!!!!!  Memory-  Terrence, Anita, and I used to always hang out.  This was around 9th grade, when I used to have a social life and be out on Friday.  So anyway, the three of us go to the videostore one night to get a movie.  We're feeling pretty bored so we get "O" not knowing much about it.    What can I say?  That movie, similar to Bamboozled, is a movie I'd never want to watch around white people.  Too make it worse, it was Marcus and Terrence two black guys, and Anita who is white.  Now check this, this movie is about a dude who is dating a white girl at a private school, and long in short he chokes her to death in the end.  Makes a dramatic speech about being a crazy black dude, then shoots himself (the DVD froze oddly at the moment he shot himself.  So you see the muzzle flash, and he buckles in but it stays like that for 10 seconds) needless to say we didn't talk about the movie.  Anita went and got the phone, and one of our parents drove us home.    It was a funny experience, because we didn't talk about it for months.  I guess the movie spoke for itself!  If anyone has seen "O" I'm sure they know what I'm talking about.

      Listening to George Benson's  "What you won't do for love".  Nice Jazzy song.  Julia, I hadn't actually meant that incident in particular (because it was a drop in the pond) but hell I already talked to you online.  Hard to express in words.   Worked fuckin' 7 fuckin' hours today.  Cleared out a damn house.  I try not to have any anger at Lauren for being at all involved in the closing on this house, but it's really pissing me off.  It's bad enough she's taken an 'extended vacation' from school, and her boyfriend/fiance/husband's family is where her life is now, but the least she could do was help clean up her own damn stuff!  Maybe I'm just tired.  Song just changed to KRS-ONE's "Get yourself up".  'How you think you free when you act like property?' Great line.  SATII US History is a must take for anyone who took the AP US test, it'll be a sinch.  Speaking of AP US I have my work cut out for me in that class, not to mention my letter for Robles this weekend, and Lit. Journalism for McGrane.  If it's the end of the year, why do I not feel happy?  Song changed again.  Askari X's (Soldier X) "Ward of the StateII" one of my favorite songs.  "...and the tears that I wiped away from the eyes of my mother and my woman every time they cried.  When it's they finally said goodbye at the end of my visit, and I wonder what is it, that keep a young brother like me...."  Oh, good news though.  I got money for working, 10 dollars an hour, but besides that I have more money coming in! I got the job at the summer program, 2nd year working there.  Hopefully I'll get stationed at Cameron, because it was awful odd being so young and the only guy doing the preschool.  Although now that I'm seventeen (and can 'legally' buy games rated M and see NC-17 movies) I somehow feel like I'm sooooooo much older, even though I'm really not.  I don't even have a liscense!  So, I guess that managed to brighten my day.  Okay, I could recollect, or I could ramble.  Samone has lime disease,  que triste .  I realized I really really really can't stand black religious people.  I can deal with it in church, because it's a place where the disease (too much Snow Crash!) is actually spread and I need to spend my own time resisting it, but at lunch for example:  Frosh:   Anyone want a Velocity [magazine]? Dan & Greg: Nah, don't have any money. Me: Hold on sounds interesting... Dan: Here we go again... Me: How much is it? Frosh: One dollar.   Here you go.    Me:   Bad grammar... Too [tree-hugging] liberal... Dan: Can I see?     See I agree with President Bush on the gay marriage thing but I'm still a democrat.  WHY THE HELL ARE BLACK PEOPLE SO BLIND!!!!!!! This guy has watched Lesbian pornos before, what guy hasn't?, and he has the nerve to say 'Being gay is wrong'.  I couldn't even bring this up, I wasn't trying to hold back the urge I had at that moment to bore half (actually more then half) of the Christian garbage (granted not all of Christianity is garbage, but that's true of all religion) out of his head with a broken snapple bottle.  Actually that's not true at all, but needless to say I'm dumbfounded by how powerful Christian evangelist (which is the polite word for zealots/fundamentalist) can actually think (do they think?) these type of things.  I better back down.  I'm no atheist myself, nor do I see any wisdom in being one.... I'm so religiously confused I guess I just gave up.  Sorry to all the really Christian people who read this.

      I remember in confirmation class, see I can dislike my religion since it's my own affair now!, how Mrs. Fuller (teacher of the class) had told us never to laugh at any racist joke, because then people would assume that it's fine to tell them around you.  SOOOOOOO true.  I could name specific incidents, and specific people, but it happens so much around me, that it's almost pointless.  Usually the jokes are all the same, "      nigger  " and I really can't laugh.  I just feel awkward, because this is always in a group of white people.  It bothers me more when I think of how much people must say 'nigger' when I'm not around... But that isn't the point.  The point is that it's one of the few words in English that will make me cringe.... Actually that's not fair.  At my lunch table, Greg get's mad at people (Craig) for saying it, but that's about it.  And when Craig, who is black says it, much of the sting is lost.  It just sound ignorant when he says it, but when I hear it in a joke.... Wow, I can't express how it makes me feel.  It's not sad, and it's not angry.  It's sort of like, I should do something, but I really don't want to go off on my friends an alienate myself.  Thus starts the memetic pollution!  I guess that was what was on my mind.  I have hella-work for next week, and I can't focus.

      Two things, then maybe some rambling.  The first is about 'Race not mattering' like that awful piece of writting we read for Journalism 'Family Portrait in Black and White'.  It was basically about this white guy who married a black woman and was trying to prove how race was meaningless.  The only flaw of the philosophy, is that REAL racist don't believe it.  But whatever.  What's even worse is unconscious racism.  Like today, "I was driving through Irvington, that's like the Ghetto.  It wasn't too much of a problem though, I kept my windows rolled up."  "Yeah it's not a problem as long as your just driving through, and don't stop or anything."  What the hell is that supposed to mean? Why would any right minded student think that backwards.  Oooh snap son, I was driving through the town that borders us, and their are so many niggers there, I really hope none of them decide to harrass and kill me.  *Rolling of eyes*    Next, story time.  I was recollecting camp, as I often do, and remembered this girl I was obsessed with.  I think I was about 13 at the time of this, my first year being a 'senior' at camp.  Our sister cabin, we got along with decently, but I hung out with three girls.  One of them was Christina, who I was friends with my last three years of camp (I only went 4), one of her friends who's name I can't rember, and Felipa (I spelled that wrong) Hernandaz.  I became completely hung up with Felipa.  She was same age (I think) maybe 12 at the time, didn't really matter. Oh, and she was Mexican! She wasn't seriously hot, I mean she was 12 at the time (I was 13, I wasn't a pervert!), but that's beyond the point.  I was obsessed with her, and somehow didn't tell her this the entire time while I was at camp despite the fact info travels fast among 200 or so people.  So I told one of her friends, hoping the rumor would spread to her.  Silence a few days.... Then one day I was going to Wikappeck (a cabin with appliances!) to get my laundry, and Filly (her nickname) was there.  Someone, I forget who, said something like "Do you like Marcus?" when I was around and she said "No,  ."  The thing is I forget what she said after no, but I just recall, oddly, not being crushed.  Strange.  She never came back to camp.  That's fairly odd, but stranger is that was over 4 years ago.  Oooh actually, come to think of it that was also the first year I met Sonya and Samone, but details.  I just find it strange that has been on my mind all day, and that I've never talked about that.  Enough rambling.

      Alright change of tattoo plans.&nbsp; I originally wanted an Ouroboros (snake eating it's tail) that would wrap around my arm.&nbsp; That's a no-no now.&nbsp;   Now I think the best thing would be either to get that African symbol "There is nothing to fear but God" despite my millitant 'I dunno' world view.&nbsp; Or else I could get a Vever drawing for Legba or if I was lucky I could find one for Oggun, Chango, or a Ghede (Baron Samedi?).&nbsp; If you didn't figure that out Vever drawings are drawings used in voodoo ceremonies.&nbsp; I don't know if they like tattooing but voodoo is pretty damn open about things.

      I   am   going to live forever or die trying.  Agnostic/Pantheistic thought-  Dying shouldn't be significant, since death isn't really death.&nbsp; Before you were born, you were some molecules scattered all over the place, and had no mind.&nbsp; How is that time before life different then the time afterlife?&nbsp; To a larger extent, you've always existed, and always will exist, but a miniscule amount of that time is spent being alive as the person you currently are.  &nbsp; I can't think of anything non-philosophical.

That'd be pretty tight.

      I'm still pretty damn depressed from talking to Geninne.&nbsp; She talked alot about Grandma and was right about most of the things she said as I unfortunately found out. &nbsp; On Saturday morning my parents left early to go to Art's Fest in Baltimore.&nbsp; They do that yearly but they were going to let me and nia stay home alone.&nbsp; No problems yet. I was supposed to go over to Grandma's house at 10AM, I woke up 12 something.&nbsp; I figured she would have come by so I went down ate breakfast, and called her.&nbsp; She wasn't home.&nbsp; Fine, life goes on.&nbsp; Tom wants to come over, Tom comes over.  &nbsp; Grandama calls around 2 or 3.&nbsp; "Marcus I'm coming by."&nbsp; "Well Grandma, one of my friends is over." She comes by seems slightly annoyed that her, to quote her, 'Favorite Grandson' is playing video games with his friend rather then boarding up her windows.&nbsp; So Nia is glad to go, and make some money.&nbsp; Grandma calls around 2 or 2 1/2 hours later.&nbsp; "Where do you want to go for dinner?"&nbsp; "Tom is still over."&nbsp; "When is he going? I don't feel confortable with you having friends over when your parents aren't home."&nbsp; I just rolled my eyes, and told him he should go my grandma was acting psycho. &nbsp; So we eat at Eagle Rock.&nbsp; She starts talking about this courtcase she was on the jury for where some kid invited his friend over and did something, she speaks far to generally to understand when she tells stories.&nbsp; So I'm thinking "Grandma, I'm 17, not 10.&nbsp; I should be able to handle simple things like this." But of course, you just bite your tongue around grandma.&nbsp; She said some other stuff that got to me, stuff about people's hair not looking right, and how Gennine wasn't going to get a job with all her holes in her ear, and her tongue pierced.&nbsp; Ironically she did get the with dyfs (whatever the acronym is), and is far more successful then Grandma would lead me to believe.... &nbsp; To much of a rant.&nbsp; But that's all I do isn't it?

Here are some Jersey laws:  New Jersey  -You cannot pump your own gas. All gas stations are full service and full service only.  -On a highway you can not park under a bridge.  -It is against the law to "frown" at a police officer.  -If you have been convicted of driving while intoxicated, you may never again apply for personalized license plates.  -It is illegal to offer whiskey or cigarettes to animals at the local zoo.  -Raw hamburger may not be sold.

      Hip Hop with Ms. Jen, I don't know why I say that she's my age, today.  Of course I insisted on going, because I love to dance.  Camille went also.  On that note, Camille was talking to me today, and I saw a blue speck on her tongue.  So I scream "Oh my gawd! You've got your tongue pierced!"  I shouldn't have said that around little kids, she had to pretend it was gum and take it out lol.  Needless to say she was pissed.  Ewwww... Tongue piercings look so painful.   Speaking of body modifications does anyone know what a Babolonyian (SP?) tattoo is?  It's nickname is "barking" like bark on a tree.  It's seriously nasty stuff, that's another thing I hope never to see.  Memes man!

      I got back from Martha's Vineyard a few hours ago.  Besides dad being a jerk, which I'll detail later, It went pretty well.  It would have been unremarkable if not for a trip we took while on the Island.  Idris' dad is a Greek, Omega Psi Phi, and saw another brother (in two ways).  So he got invited to a barbeque at his house.  Dad dropped him off we went about our business, we come back to pick Mr. Evans up and ended up staying awhile ourselves.  Naturally everyone was talking to me about college.  This one guy who was trying to convince my mom to move out to Somerset so more black people would be out there, had went to Rutgers and then UC: Berkley for gradschool. He was talking about Rutgers.  Then this other lady, who was a Delta (the Delta call is great stuff), started talking about Howard, and she seriously got me to reconsider it again.   For those who don't know I've been batting this school around since mid-10th grade, and had said no to it for awhile.  She comes along and proves all my misconceptions wrong about it.  So.... hell, if they have elementry education (what black school wouldn't?) as a major, I'd definitely go there.    She had one really good point.  She said, if you don't go to a black school you are going to struggle to fit in, and your going to be overly concerned with what the people you hang out with look like.  She said that doesn't happen so much at Howard, and you can focus on actually knowing people.  That selling point rang pretty true, and hell, Great-Grandpa Robinson (or was it Chislom?) went there.

      Oh I also forgot.  Hip Hop with Ms. Jennifer DaSilva was today.  She apparently is 18, but must not have gone to Columbia because I don't remember seeing her around school, and she's pretty too so I find it even stranger I never saw her before.  It was funny explaining to kids what hip hop was.  "Imagine everything wonderful mixed into a dance."  "So we are going to be watching it?"  "No! We get to do it!"  It was hella fun, and since I had to do it (needing to keep my black liscense) anyway, I tried to have a good time until one of my kids needed to go back to Ms. Carmen for a water bottle.

      My parents went to the Black Film Festival in the Newark Museum yesterday to see "The Spook who Sat By the Door".  I've wanted to see the movie, but I had no desire to go with my parents to see it.  Fortunately, my parents loved it enough to buy a DVD copy of it.  Apparently the movie was so controversial when it came out in the 1970's that the Fed's supposedly 'removed' most of the copies.  The only way to get it until recently was from bad bootlegs of it.  Fortunately, it was found in some Hollywood vault recently and digitally remastered and all that jazz.  I really have to say, for any revolutionary thinking person, this movie is really heavy.  It starts off with a Senator wanting to get elected president, but he'll lose by a narrow margin unless he gets the black vote.  So he decides to prove himself pro-negro by integrating the CIA.  Long story short one guy becomes a key agent in the CIA, but quits.   He uses his training from the CIA to train street gangs to fight a Guerilla war against the United States.  Coming from an anarchist perspective, I almost cried.  The director of the movie clearly researched things well when he made the movie, and explained sooo many things about guerilla warfare.  For example, this one guy is testing distances and the former CIA guy tells him "Street Lamps are placed 30 feet apart, use that as a reference point for distance."    The movie also had a strong message about race.  The whites in the movie were all clearly evil, and even some of the blacks, it's not really like that in real life.  But besides that, the main character stresses it's "not about hating whitey, but loving freedom."   Oh, and to top it all off one of the quotes from the Dead Prez Album "Let's Get Free" comes from that.   After being told he and the other light-skinned gang members are to rob a bank]  Pretty Willie: All the yellow nigga's, right?  [His anger coming to a slow boil]  Pretty Willie: Man, I am TIRED of that! I am not passing! I am BLACK! Do you hear me, man? I am BLACK! I am a NIGGA', you understand me? I was BORN Black, I -LIVE- Black, and I'm gonna die, prob'ly -BECAUSE- I'm Black, because some Cracker who -KNOWS- I'm Black, better than -YOU-, Nigga', is prob'ly gonna put a BULLET in the back of my head!     Okay now real business.  I'm not talking about work, it's fine nothing really to say.  In two hours, we're getting into the car and driving up to Cape Cod, and then taking a ferry to Martha's Vineyard.  I haven't really decided what I personally am going to do there.  We're there all weekend, till monday, so we'll be there during the highest volume of the year.  Beautiful.  La illa la-llah  Speaking of skin color, based on the previous quote (I'll start talking about work)., I thought it was funny how Carmen (the art director) was mad at us for almost letting a kid get sunburn.  Haha, I realized at that point that sunburn was really a foreign concept to me, since I usually use (lighter) people to gauge when I need to get out of the sun.  But ewwww... yet again I wish I was darker, because my skin doesn't tan nicely, it gets darker but it also brings out my red undertone and just looks strange.  A moment it'd be good to be haitian or some other black groups that is known for being dark, would be now.    Oh, and I tied a bandana around my head randomly, and Nia said I look Mexican.  Hahaha.

      I'm feeling stress/ anxiety.  I don't really know why.   Camp was crazy fun at the start of the day.  The big kids came over with water guns and drenched our kids on Tuesday.  We told our kids we'd get the big kids back on Thursday.  Wednesday was the Bronx Zoo trip, which should have been hell but I only had three kids.  Can you say relief?  Then today we really went overboard with the water fight at the start of the day.  Nigel, Steve and Me went ahead of our camp over to meadowlands (which is just across the street and parking lot, but they stay in the teen center so our two camps don't see each other).  Nigel gets the idea to drive over, and Steve let him drive the car up the hill.  We got the people by suprise, but they were getting ready to attack us so we got wet.  So we run back to Steve's car, but we forgot to lock the doors... So Steve's car got soaked, as well as the three of us.  Then our campers came over, it was hectic for a while.  Then we went back to camp.   The Trio (of us) tried to do another sneak attack, but the co-director mike yelled at us, and said Big Kate (she's Mr. Brady's second in command, while Little Kate is the director.  This has nothing to do with their size, Big Kate isn't physically large) had yelled at him for us doing the sneak attacks on each other.  Regardless it was late in the day, and we didn't figure we had the time for an organized water fight.  So we just let camp fizzle out, until one of my campers said he lost his shoes.  The kid was slow so I wasn't sure if his shoes really had been stolen.  It ends up two kids did take them, and I had to talk to their parents....  Whatever.  I still don't know why I'm feeling stress.  I'm almost done with the 2nd Euro book, and I have plenty of time to write the two essays.  Besides that all I have to do in the next month is do the first two chapters of the AP Statistics book (although I've yet to crack the book open).  Oooh! My paycheck came (3rd one) it was for $240!!! Great stuff.  Hmmm.... Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas looks hot.  Go to gamespot.com, and read the preview, I mos def want to preorder it.  Not much else to say.  I saw a showing of Afro-Punk is going to be in South Manhattan on the 19th.  I need to find someone to go with now.
