      Time brushed away so quick, it feels as if everything had happened by one blink of an eye.  I felt a little sad after my mom left from Lax yesterday. Although, it isn't forever good-bye, it is always sad to say good-bye with people you love.  I kind of wished that only Steve, my mom, and I would go and not Amanda's family. I mean it was fun with them too, but I just hoped that us three could've have done more together. But its ok, I have next time.  I can see why people get addicted to gambling. It could be entertaining but it can also destroy your life.  I feel a little sick after I came back from Vegas. The air at the hotel was pretty bad. Because people smoked almost everywhere the air was hard to breathe.  We stopped by at the Redondo Beach on Sunday after picking my mom up from the airport. It was very nice. I loved the sensation of breeze blowing my hair and my face. And we ate at this seafood place. I'm not so fond of seafood but it was ok.  The whole morning I've been cleaning. I have few lundries and have to pack again for Saturday. I'll be on the flight for about 6 hours. That's very killing. I very much dislike being in the sky.  I'll go to Walmart later to pick up some stuff for my trip to New Jersey.  I need a bath... A very good one! Its hot outside but I want to take a warm bubble  bath. It'll help me recover from my tireness...

      Got up at 6:30 this morning. We are leaving to Lax around 10. I have forgotten to set the alarm clock but fortunately I got up early enough.  There were few things to do that were left over from yesterday: cleaning the guest bathroom, washing the towels, and sweeping the kitchen floor. Steve mowed the lawn and is watering the garden. Its a little cool and beautiful morning.  My mom insists on eating dinner with my cousin Ester. I haven't seen her for decades and I think my mom had been keeping contact with her. She's about 3 years older than I. We used to play together when we were young but as we grew older, we never appeared to connect with each other. Actually, I've tried to be close to her since I have no sisters and always envied my friends who has one and her age was closest to mine out of my other cousins. Anyway, now she is about to leave to another country to do her volunteer as a missionary. My mom wants to give her some money. The other day I argued with my mom about that. She asked me to offer her some money since she has very little. I know my mom was right but inside me, I couldn't stop myself thinking how much she had hurt me in the past and hated to do anything that is related to her. But few days ago, I agreed to meet with her for dinner. Its going to be so awkward.  For a long time, I've been having hard time letting go of my thoughts and feelings. Its very painful and I wish I know how to throw away everything about it. I'm a bad person... I shouldn't do this but my heart doesn't listen to me. Steve is so wonderful to me and I really care about him. But very deep inside of my heart, I feel the aching. I just want to know if he is doing ok... Even, without me... I wish I know if he's happy... He's supposed to go to a grad school soon, and I wish I know which school he has chosen... I wish I don't do this, I wish I can let go of it...

      My mom is coming to visit me on Sunday. We'll drive about 1 and half hour to LAX to pick her up. It is always nice to see my mom, especially, because we can't be with each other so often anymore.   Steve is taking off his 3 days of work to stay with us. This time we're going to Vegas with Steve's sister and her family. Its going to be fun.   I've been there in Jan. for the first time and gambled for the first time in my life. hehe I had my&nbsp;beginner's luck! I had won $250.00 after playing with&nbsp;few bucks out of my own pocket. Not bad huh? keekee   I noticed I've lost few pounds since I've been on my medication. When I wear my shorts or pants, I could tell its more loose around my waist. Few days ago I picked out some new clothes and tried on size 6 and wanted to try size 4 this time. It was a little tight but I was so happy. Oohoo!   I was going to stop by my new school today to take a look but decided to postpone that plan to next Friday before I leave to NJ. I'll be pretty busy this weekend.   I usually wake up between 6 and 7 in the morning, but I slept several more hours today. When I got up, it was already 9. I get this stupid guilt when I over-do something like sleeping. Over-sleeping makes me feel more tired through out the day.

      Grace and I had a meeting at 3 today earlier. She is my new case-worker and she'll be working with me through my academic years and until I enter my profession.  I really like her. When I met her for the first time about few weeks ago, I could tell she will be someone wonderful to work with. She seem to love her career and is happy with what she is doing. I could see her enthusiasm and it was good to know that she is a hearty person.  Its been a year since I've moved to California and I'm extremely glad that I'll finally be in school again this fall! I couldn't start school right away last year because I had to earn my residency due to the high college tuition and other related expense. Also, I needed some time to get adjusted to a new environment.  I have no clue what the heck I was thinking last  year deciding to move all the way from Ohio to this place so suddenly. I used to live here very long time ago so I didn't feel totally strange to this new place.  I did regret sometimes during this past year leaving my friends and family behind and having guts to start my life over again. Maybe I was crazy. I don't feel so upset now and plus its something I started. No one pushed me to do anything, it was my own decision.  Even before I met Steve, I often thought about moving to a new location; particularly to California. I knew I would move one day regardless of my father's disapproval. I never had or have any intention to hurt my parents' feelings nor disobey then in any ways. But I always believed that I should be the one who is in charge of my life. So I have and always I will be...  And when I met Steve, everything changed everything. I never, never even predicted my life with Steve, but here I am, with help from Steve, I moved. I didn't ever think of me moving or doing something because of someone but it turned out this way unexpectedly.  Life is a huge mystery. I'm glad I don't know tomorrow because if I knew every day what would happen tomorrow, it'll be no fun. I love mysteries! And I'm enjoying my mysterious tomorrows.
