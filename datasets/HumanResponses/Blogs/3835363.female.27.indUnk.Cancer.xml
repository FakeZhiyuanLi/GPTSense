      Went to the gym and did a big workout this am.  Waited around all morning for Sabrina--we were supposed to go shopping. Eventually we did.  Bought two cute outfits.. spent $100. But now I have something to wear with my new sandals.  Peja called when I was shopping and cancelled on me.  Poker night with the boys I guess.  Ah well. I have work to do anyway.   I went over to Matt's house and dropped off a bunch of lube. Wanted to see him with a shaved head again anyway.  God I love that boy.  Went home for Simpsons night and envelope stuffing.    It's kind of nice having the house all to myself all the time...

      Went with Peja to set up our joint account.  Thought it was going to be a fun day. It wasn't.  I'm suddenly in check systems for the stolen credit card problem.  I have to call Mario Diaz in SF-an exec at Wells--and see if he can pull some strings for me.   My car wasn't ready until later in the afternoon, so Peja dropped me off, I gave him his paperwork from the Department of Homeland Security, an insurance bill and one of Kelly's CD's.  Sabrina came over a little later and we got a mani/pedi.  My nails and toes look fantastic.  She dropped me off to get my car, and then I went shopping for some shoes.  Got a really cute pair of Tiffany blue thongs with a cute flower on em. And a tiny $4 purse. And some toe rings for my new cute feet.  (They need all the help they can get.)  When I came home, made dinner and tried to watch tv over the roar at Ed's house. He came over and was mad that I didn't stop over for dinner there.    Then Peja called.  He was just getting out of the shower.  I love that at least half of the times I talk to him on the phone, he's naked.  I'm not sure what makes him think of me when he's either hot and sweaty and heading in the shower, or naked and toweling off.  But it's the best conditioning I could hope for.  Association.  Seemed like he wanted to perhaps do something, but was tired after 2 hours in the gym.  I invited him over.. he said that if he went out he'd call me and perhaps come over to hang with us at Ed's. He didn't though.  So I went next door.  Heidi and Louise, Karen and (it was their 5th Anniversary--you wouldn't know--they were so bitchy to each other.) and Karen and Chad (ug) and Heidi's manager (double ugg.  can't believe I hooked up with her.)After everyone else left, Ed and I got stoned and drank wine.   Laura never came home from her Hollywood Bowl 'Sound of Music' singalong... went over to Matthew's and spent the night.  They had sex for the first time.  She's completely in love.  She fucked up again and didn't use condoms. "We did the first time... He's going to be my boyfriend anyway..."  Oh lord.  Who doesn't have condoms??  I mean really?  I hope she keeps her head clear for this recording session.  She really needs this.  I think Danny can really make this finally happen.  So exciting... I'm giddy inside about it.

      Walked from work to the bank, to home, to CSW, and back home again. Whew!  When I was at CSW doing late-night work, I chatted with Matt.  We joked about what I want for my birthday.  I think he's getting me the Elsa Peretti ring I've always wanted. If he does, I'll die.   When I finally got home, Laura & Ed were having beers.  Apparently they were doing some blow earlier.  Thank god I wasn't there for that. Kelly Mantle came over a little later.  It was his birthday. He doesn't celebrate them.  Ever.  Wouldn't tell us how old he was either. His CD was finished, artwork and all.  It sounds good.  And inside, he listed Laura and I in the special thanks.  Sniff.  Love him.

      This morning I woke to my TV on (as usual) and swear I was dreaming of Kenneth Lay getting arrested.  When I really woke, there was a pending press conference staged on the set.  It was a podium, blue backdrop for the department of homeland security.  Delay delay delay in the press confernce.  What is this all about? Maybe I wasn't dreaming and something big is going on with Enron's Kenny. Eventually I heard, while waiting for Tom Ridge to hit the stage, that he was indited on 11 charges by the SEC.  But then the press conference starts and it's another fucking Bush ploy.  All of sudden they're warning us that they have credible information that Al Queda plans to initiate another terrorist attack, possibly before the election. Where? Don't know. When? Don't know. Why? Don't know.  Did they raise the color of terror from yellow to orange?  NO. Bullshit.  There was nothing on the news all day about Enron because Bush makes up this fucking shit about new and yet unsubstantiated claims.  I can't believe they get away with it!  I was supposed to meet Irene at Runyon Canyon for our weekly hike at 8:30am. I wound up being a few minutes late, called her to let her know, but got her vm.  When I got there she was't there. Waited a while, and by 9:50 I decided to head back. I had to get ready, pack my lunch, and get Woody down to Karmie's garage. Irene drove by me on her way up the hill, stopped to apologize, and I guess did the walk by herself.    Karmie told me he'd take my time with my car and make sure everything was all good.  He's so fantastic.  I walked from the Mobile station on Santa Monica back to the gallery at Hollywood and Wilcox. That's quite a walk. But it was nice.   Danny called me this afternoon to say hi. He's flying in on my birthday, but into Long Beach.  Maybe Laura and I will do something down there and pick him up since it's my birthday. Can't wait to see him. God I love that man.   Sabrina stopped by the gallery later to give me my CSW check. I have to get to the bank with Peja.  I have over $2000 in checks on me right now.  And $3 in cash to my name. Took the bus home.  Ate way too many salt and vinegar chips.  It's like fucking crack to me. So I cleaned the bathroom.  Made some salmon for dinner, and cleaned the bathroom again. So here I am writing as a distraction.   I should smoke some herb and get to bed. I really have to get to the CSW office and finish up Michael's auction mailing.

      I met Julie tonight for dinner at Chan Dara on Cahuenga. It's cute, though the Thai girls in bikini tops and super-minis for some reason make you feel gluttonous about slurping down their amazing pad thai.   Julie and I talked about all the projects we've been working on lately.  She was really impressed that I pulled off the gay pride parade, and even though I told her it was a nightmare, she said it looked really pristigious.  She just got back from France visiting her sister and kids, and had some funny stories about how fun Paris was.  I need to get there before I'm 30 for buddha's sake.   She's doing PR for this exhibit at the California Science Center. It's called Body Worlds... "BODY WORLDS is unlike any exhibition that has ever come before. It explores bodily performance at a depth never before possible on such a comprehensive scale. Thanks to the breakthrough process of plastination, more than 200 real human specimens are displayed to reveal an extraordinary new look inside the human body."  Essentially, an artist/scientist/researcher took donated cadavers, and peeled away all their muscles, skin, etc. to reveal singluar systems. There's one of just the nervous system, one with all muscles and he's holding his own skin, a woman with a fetus.. I've got to go. I think Lori and Laura and I will go see it. That was really the highlight of dinner, oddly enough!  Mark and her friend Corrine joined us then we headed to the Burgundy Room for a quick drink before walking down to Club Lingerie to see Beth Hart's show.  She was really amazing. Sounded like Janis Joplin without the heroin.  I'll have to look for her cds at Amoeba.    After the show, whose sound system was much too loud--my ears are still ringing--we met another couple that Julie and Mark are friends with, Paula and Greg.  We all went to the Cat & the Fiddle for yet another drink and some good ole English fried food.  One of the few places you can go to get fries and malted vinegar. We got an order of battered & fried vegetables, and one of the vegetable types was carrot.  Who in their right mind would make a fried carrot. It was hard and disgusting.  Even those who like carrots would agree with me.  Mushrooms, zucchini, yams, onion rings, even eggplant, yes.  BUT carrots?  NO!  Why don't you just do celery too?  That would probably taste better. Just something to ponder.    Anyway, Greg went to Carnegie Mellon from 94-98. Funny huh?  One year off of my stint in the burgh.  So we bonded over that for a while.  Loved Uncle Sams...Primante Bros. Apparently he's a filmmaker, whose film is being distributed in just about every country but the US.  11:14 is the title. Dark comedy.  I'm intrigued.   Julie and Mark dropped me off at the house--since I kept my promise to Peja and didn't drive.  I'm actully proud of myself for doing that.  I really had no intention of keeping my word at the time. I have to take it into the shop tomorrow morning.  Karmie is the best. Going to fix it cheap for me. Hopefully I can pass smog and get a new starter for under a grand in repairs...  When I came home, Laura was on the phone with Matthew.  I sat in the living room as she talked, or rather responded only to his side of the conversation. It was wierd.  Distinctly felt like she was uncomfortable having me in the room, but didn't make any move toward privacy.  And the conversation seemed benign.  I smoked a bowl and a cigarette, and went up to bed.  From my bedroom, I immediately noticed that when I left the room her convesation changed. She was back to actually talking.  Strange.  Wonder what she's hiding.  Or not hiding, but self-conscious of.  I turned on the TV and fell asleep.

      Peja called me this afternoon, and there was an uneasy tone in his voice.  We had talked about my birthday weeks ago. Originally he had plans to go to Hawaii for Mick and Alice's wedding. But when we were at Griffith Park for the crazy Sweedish picnic, he told me that he wasn't going to be able to go.  His jeep had problems again, and he didn't have the money to go.  So I figured he'd be in town for my birthday.  Still bad news that he couldn't go to Hawaii.. but anyway...   "Remember when you told me about your birthday party, and I kept thinking and thinking about why that date stuck out in my head? Well I just figured out what day that is.  It's Mick & Alice's wedding."   "I thought you weren't going Hawaii."   "I'm not.  But they're having a Korean ceremony here on the 17th, and then a big reception.  It's here in LA. And  then  they go to Hawaii."   "Oh, well... I mean.. I was thinking about changing the date anyway. I.."  "No, I'll be there regardless.  I just won't be able to get there until later.  Let me find out what time everything is.  I think it's early.  Don't.."   "No, there were a whole bunch of conflicts... Charles is having a party, a girl from the gallery is having a party.  A bunch of my friends are out of town. I'll just--"  "Well, it's definitely up to you. Do what you think is best--but I'll be there regardless."   So he told me to let him know whatever I decided to do.  Then I told him that I was going to call him about something. Couldn't remember what though. And we chatted some more and some more. Still couldn't remember. Still can't remember now.  But he asked me about my car. And got really stern with me.  It was cute, acutally.  But he really gets upset that I'm driving my Jeep without insurance. (Have to get a new carburetor so I can pass smog before they'll finish my registration and thus insure me.) LA really sucks that way.  It's impossible to drive an old car.  I'd say it was good but it's just another patriarchial conspiracy to keep those with less down. If you can afford a new Audi, no problem.  Hummers?  Oh yeah, they'll pass.  But my poor old Jeep that was made before we knew what ozone was..  no way.  Off the roads, madam.   But he made me promise him that I wouldn't drive my car.  I said I only drive it to work.  And he kept at it.   "Promise, me Kellie," He said. Silence from me. "Promise me.  I'm serious. Promise me."  Silence.  "You don't know what might happen.  Remeber when I had that little thing happen. Three years.  Three years to get that... you know about that.. Please." Silence.  "Kellie, I can't let you.. Promise me, please."    "Okay. Okay," I said.   "Say it," he said. "Tell me you won't drive your car. Promise me."   "Okay, I promise.  But I have to get it home first."   "Kellie, I'm serious.  Take a cab to work tomorrow, take the bus.  It's not very far.  Just don't drive.  I mean it."   "Okay, I promise. I won't drive. I'll make my appointment today to get my Jeep fixed."   "Okay, thank you."   I told him I wouldn't drive. And I guess I'm going to really try to stick to that.  But I'm not sure I can.  There are some things that I really need to do.  I mean, I have no cash. I have to go to the bank.  I'm not sure I even will have enough money to get to work and back. Well, I will, but...   I hate making promises I can keep.  And I want him to trust me.  And it's really nice that he cares so much that he got really upset about it.  And wouldn't let me go without hearing me promise him.  Shit.  I really need to get my car fixed.

      Peja asked me to go to Loews Beachfront Hotel yesterday to finish off the 4th of July weekend.  Part of me wishes I had gone, but I was crampy, and wasn't sure I wanted to baste in the sun all day.    In the end, it wound up being nicer anyway. He called me from the pool and said he was starving and on his way home soon. I was going to ask him over for dinner anyway, but it seemed like the perfect idea now.  So he called me when he got home, and like usual, had to get in the shower... (I don't know what it is about him, but it's like he just HAS to talk to me every time he's getting naked.  Going in the shower, all hot and sticky from the gym, coming out of the shower, drying off from the shower... torture.)   Skip ahead, he asks me what I'm making for dinner. I told him I was thinking about making salmon. (I found an amazing recipe for salmon with black bean and roasted banana mash, with a coconut and serrano chile broth.)  So I had this all planned. Had the butcher cut me a  beautiful fillet, got the chilis, lemon grass. He tells me, "Oh no. I hate salmon. But that's okay."  I told him that it obviously wasn't okay.  I wasn't going to make him an extravagant meal that he'd hate.    So I figured this was an important conversation to have.  "Do you just hate salmon?  Or do you not eat fish?"  "Well, I'm not a big fish fan.  I really hate salmon, but I do eat some good white fish.  Sea bass, if it's cooked really well."    Oh no, I'm thinking.  How could I have married a man who doesn't eat fish?!  It was almost comical to me.  I used to think that there were two really important (and terribly odd) qualities I wanted in the man I'd wind up marrying.  1) I have this thing against circumcizing my kid, should I have a boy.  Always wanted to have that big conversation with any prospective dad. Not that I don't like 'em cut.  But they're much better as is.  And I just couldn't mame my son in the name of some conservative American tradition.  2.) The second one is a little less odd--gotta love sushi.  It gives me such a high. I can't imagine not sharing that with my husband.  Who would've thought I'd get the FIRST one in the bag??  Anyway, I digress.  I wound up making chicken breast stuffed with spinach, shittake mushrooms and blue brie, with a couscous and a sweet pepper eggplant ragu.  Found a bottle of Pelligrino; I always like to have Italian bottled water when I cook for him. He seemed to like dinner.  Ate it all in about 2 minutes.  No, he did tell tell me it was delicious, at least three times.  When he ate it so quickly, I had to ask if he was still hungry.  Peja enthusiastically asked if there was more.  Then I felt silly, saying no, that there was not.  So I made him a turkey sandwich.  He thought that the sandwich was delicious too.  Shrug.  Note to self: he can eat a lot.  I mean a lot.  He seemed proud of his stomach capacity, so I indulged him in his moment of machismo.  During dinner, we watched my new found channel addition, Comedy Central, and his FAVORITE show, 'Reno 911.'  It really is as funny as he's been telling me.   The cutest though was that he brought over 'Along Came Polly' on DVD. He was chilly because his back was sunburnt, so I got him a blanket and he got all cuddled up on the sofa.  The movie was hilarious.  One of the funniest I've seen in a long time. We laughed and laughed and laughed. And you know how sometimes, when you start getting comfortable with someone, even the smallest things can feel so good? Well, soon enough he changed positions, and our bodies were touching for the rest of the movie.  Such a small, and perhaps completely insignifant thing.  But one of the subconscious triggers that makes you feel safe.    What's funny about that, is the same thing started with Rob and I.  We would be together so much in our circle, just hanging out. And yeah, we had occasional moments of hooking up, once a year or so.  But it was always unspoken, you know.  Even between the two of us.  But that was always the catalyst.  We sit next to each other, our thighs touching, a light brush against the back of my palm. The extended hug, a kiss on the lips.  It's kind of odd that I'm making an analogy between Rob and Peja.  I still can't figure out what I think or want when it comes to Rob.  Suppose the same is true of Peja.  I guess they're just healthy distractions while I figure out how to love myself first.

      I met Sabrina and her friend Taz for breakfast at Highland Grounds this morning.  Laura had just gotten back from her 36 hour date with Matthew; we talked only briefly because she had to get to the Grounds for her shift.  So that's the reason we picked our venue.   It's crazy how love can be so intoxicating.  Even viciously. I meant to type vicariously, but thought I'd leave my stream of consiousness unedited. Maybe it's the Wellbutrin, but I'm so excited for her.  Renews the hope that there really are those amazing men out there... somewhere.   So we got to talking about the events planned for my birthday.  Guess Sabrina and Laura finally came up with a theme, and I like it.  We're going to start off the day with early cocktails at Powerhouse--the best dive bar in all of LA.  I was just there with my old high school friend, Pat, who now teaches at UCLA, and we found out it's closing in the end of July.  So this will kind of be a farewell celebration to the best damn place to get a pitcher of Natty Light.  Maybe they'll give me one of the scary clown paintings since it's my birthday.   Then we're heading back to the house.  The theme is everything 1977.  Sabrina wants to do a video confessional for me.  We're going to hipp-ify the house; put a little tent up in the living room; tie-dye everywhere; patchouli soaked air; a little memorial to elvis in the corner; and everyone will hopefully dress as they remember 1977.  What the hell else happend in '77 besides Elvis kicking it?  I should do some research.   I'm hoping a lot of people start jamming..  How cute to have a little hippie fest, right in the comfort of my own home. "Make Love Not War" never sounded so timely to me.  Maybe Michael Moore will stop by.

      Last night my roommate and I went to a Birthday party for someone we didn't know. In fact, we hardly knew the guy who invited us.  But a party is a party.  When we showed up, with a purse of Budweiser, we were initially surprised by how nice the house was. Then we walked to the back, as were the directions on the front door, and were greeted by a moroccan lounge and a giant inflatable bouncy room.  You know, the kind that they have in kiddie parks?  When was the last time you did that? As an adult?  Oh yeah, good times.   The birthday boy, Matthew, was adorably cute.  Laura thought he was gay.  I said no. And reminded her that straight guys can wear glitter--especially if it's his birthday.  Well, skip ahead, they fell in love.  Couldn't separate the two of them. He's apparently a fantastic drummer, friends with Darren, think he has his own studio.  She could do much worse. We'll see what happens next.   And fire dancing!! Who has fire dancers and bongos at their birthday party?  Someone with really great friends, I guess.  Can't even explain how incredible the pyrotricks were, but I've got photos.  One more reason to have a camera phone. You never know when it might come in handy.  I feel kind of bad because I got really bitchy when I left. It was 5am by the time I finally got out of there. Laura had said that she wasn't staying at the house..  I was really bored for the last few hours, they ran out of booze..  But then she decided to spend the night.  I wound up walking from El Centro to Highland before I could hail a cab.  That sucked, but at least I wasn't abducted that time.  Now what in the hell do I do at MY birthday party?
