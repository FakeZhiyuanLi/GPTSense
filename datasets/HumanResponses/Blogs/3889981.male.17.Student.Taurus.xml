       The yellowed parchment crumpled in the gnarled hand and bony fingers that closed upon it. The paper was malleable in its own sense, yet brittle if approached in the wrong way. Flakes of brown parchment flitted in the soft breeze that circulated the room, as creases, some a darker shade of yellow, others dark brown, appeared where they had not been before. The hand opened, veins showing clearly in skin wrapped so thinly over bone that sometimes there was more white than pale that could be seen, and the paper whisked upwards and around the room haphazardly, most guided by the wind, but leaving behind the core of what is dancing above the palm of the hand. It was no longer just one piece of paper as the message had come to him, nor merely just the random bits of paper that broke off with age, but the shape and size of each separate bit of paper that floated above his palm had a specific way that it blew in the wind, all in all presenting a very different message than that had been written.   Janadas.   The name had not been spoken, not least for the last century since the old man had lived in the room. Neither had he been disturbed, for the age-old enchantment on an elliptical, reflective rune sitting on its obsidian pedestal in the middle of its study prevented anybody from intruding upon his privacy. He frowned, unhappy with the casual way he had been addressed, inferring the disrespect that came with the name. The frown did not do much than add its own creases to the already wrinkled with age skin, as the wizard’s eyes gleamed with the yellow light characteristic of all powerful wizards who have approached their Prime, the time period where the ability manifested itself to its maximum, still with as much intensity as they were decades ago. Even the slightest apprentice failed to lose his power with age, except the physical sense of spell casting, but for the old man the eyes were the only features he had managed to retain from his youth.  The papers danced their message above his palm, continuing its magical relaying as he made out the words in the dim light. The grotesque stump of beeswax candle burned faintly, its meager flame flickered and guttered, leaving acrobats of shadow where its light did not reach. The faint glow left much to be desired in the way of light for a commoner, yet he had long grown accustomed to the dim settings. The weak glow illuminated the archmage’s study, his arcane sanctuary. Tomes of unspoken power, bound with all sorts of hide, even human, adorned the rows upon rows of shelves that lined the circular room. The shelves were a wonder by themselves, their exquisite workmanship evident in the failing light, where magical designs prevented the wrong hands from getting to the shelves without permission. All that, and much more, had been acquired during the great mage’s adventuring days. Now he lived sequestered deep in his tower where young aspiring magi came for tutelage. Powerful magics had been drawn in the construction of the tower, for the blocks of black granite that had been hewn from the mountain face of the Daishain Mountains a thousand miles away had been carried with an unerring precision that outdid any mortal’s work, as arcane glyphs and sigils engraved upon the impregnable stone walls interweaved and twined together, forming intricate designs that defied the eye, making even the finest lace seem drab. Even a century after its construction, the tower still prickled with fey energies from the residue of its making.  The man focused his eyes, the yellow gleam still undiminished with age, upon the bits of parchment that still danced their message. His initial irritation was soon smoothed over as the message unfurled its contents. The frown dissipated, leaving only the wrinkles of age, as his facial muscles twitched in a smile. Excitement added its own gleam to the magical yellowness in his eyes, an emotion so seldom associated with the man even in his younger days, but he could have been a different man then, as he nodded his head in what seemed like agreement.  As the final word played itself out, the man threw his head back and roared in maniacal laughter, the sound traveling through the entrance to his study, past the enchanted arch that served as the trans-dimensional walkway, bouncing off the walls yet never reducing its magnitude, where startled servants dropped pots and apprentices glanced out their quarters cautiously, wondering what monster had been the source of that laugh. Other acclaimed wizards looked in the direction of the laughter with puzzled expressions, wondering if he had finally gone mad, although that could not have been technically true as he was already half mad at best.

      I swear that from this day onwards I shall treat my blog like a revered god, for providing me with the privilege of using it as an alternative form of communication. It is only my second day with retainers but I might as well be mute - Ms Lee says that I "talk too softly" and Dong accusingly said something on the line of me being insolent.  The week in general has been rainy. Raindrops HAVE been falling on my head in great volume - not the watery kind that gifts you the common cold, but more of the mental kind. The kind that takes its form in bad things that happen.  I think the greatest woe I have had this week is the thought of struggling through my retainers. It's been sickening. I just don't want to think about it, but it's difficult to forget that it's the contraption that is almost choking you in the mouth every day.  Mind block.  I will be back. I promise.

      Don't ever  try  to dabble in orthodontics, let alone put on braces - it has been a devilish few years of torture for me, and after today it looks set to continue for at least another year.  I had a great week, and like any other person recently released from the bondage of metal-in-mouth I had a fantastic time eating anything I wanted. Sticky, spicy, jelly - I enjoyed them the most in this week.  Then came something that would spoil my less-than-perfect week.  Retainers.  Firstly, it didn't taste very good. I am in no position to complain on taste of orthodontic material, but trust me, that wasn't the most sickening part.  15 minutes after my debut wearing the retainers - I took the transparent one, since, being the cheapskate, it was the least expensive - I began to feel my lips drying up.  All the saliva was stuck on the retainers. Urgh.  Worst of all - my articulation is now terrible. Ash in, my articulashun ish naw terrible.  And the dentist says it'll be another half-a-year until she determines if I still require my retainersh. She isn't optimistic about my chances though - I'd most probably have to wear them till the end of next year.  &)^&amp;*^&*%(%&amp;%(%&$^$@#$!#$%!#$%!#$%   The following was too difficult to interpret for the human ear. Upon machinery interpretation it seems that the blogger was attempting to utter a string of profanities about the last part of orthodontic treatment - the retainers.

      I'm sorry for saying earlier somewhere in my life that Michael Bublé is a not-so-good singer. I take that back. Seriously. Lately I'm getting addicted to his "Moondance" song, and for those who think that Clay Aiken is the only guy that can sing, check out this guy. And he doesn't need powerful vocals to express himself.  Back to my life. Someone said today that my blog is too confusing to read. In fact, almost literary. I apologise for that too, but it is my style and I like the way I'm handling this blog, though it's boring since I have only text, text and more text to show.   I won't forget the last time I had slight depression, and I don't think I will ever hit that level of emotion again, but lately stuff hasn't been going my way and it is unfortunate to know that most of it has been my fault.  Contradictory to popular belief, I am not a calm person - I am in fact struggling inside.  Surely things will get better.

      Imagine talking with half of the working part of your brain that's shut down.  Yes, I'm doing that now. Right now.  I believe there are some necessary corrections that have to be made to the recent article on The Establishment. The first, of course, is about the inaccuracy of the membership of the ALC. I did state in the previous article that the membership is 24, but it is of course incorrect, since unless we expand the ALC it is impossible to achieve such a number since, of course, we only have a maximum of 24 people in the class.  And, yes, there are people who, for some reason, prefer to stay Neutral - with a capital N to denote that they aren't really neutrals - by not joining THE club of the moment. Thus for the mathematically-inclined (or not), the membership of the club is definitely less than the abovementioned number.  So I believe that I have made adequate corrections to my previous article.

      Elton John has a suggestion.  SAD SONGS (Say So Much) Music by Elton John, Lyrics by Bernie Taupin (Performed by Elton John)  Guess there are times when we all need to share a little pain And ironing out the rough spots Is the hardest part when memories remain And it's times like these when we all need to hear the radio Cause from the lips of some old singer We share the troubles we already know  Chorus Turn 'em on, turn 'em on Turn on those sad songs When all hope is gone Why don't you tune in and turn them on  They reach into your room Just feel their gentle touch When all hope is gone Sad songs say so much  If someone else is suffering enough to write it down When every single word makes sense Then it's easier to have those songs around The kick inside is in the line that finally gets to you And it feels so good to hurt so bad And suffer just enough to sing the blues  Chorus Sad songs they say, sad songs they say Sad songs they say, sad songs they say so much Chorus  ------------  I love this song because of its rhythm and the way the lyrics fit into life. Ever since I started listening to songs (not just oldies) I've been trying to find how these songs fit into any aspect of our lives. Some do, most don't, but this fits just like a missing piece of a jigsaw.

      The above word isn't defined as something similar to the word 'crack', if you know what I mean - what I mean is, I'm taking a well-deserved rest, away from the hustle and bustle of freelance imagination journalism.  Of course that's not my full-time job; I am, unfortunately, still a junior college student (and a poor one at that). But recently I have burnt myself out with all my nonsensical things that I am busying myself with.  The time is 10.40pm and I have just returned from a day spent in the Scout Lore Quest. For tenderfeet (that's the term for non-Scouts), the Scout Lore Quest is some sort of trivia quiz where we pit our knowledge against one another. In the finals there were four teams - Anglican High, Anglo-Chinese (Barker), Raffles Institution 02, and Holy Innocent's.  The first round was nicely done - we had 8 points, sharing the lead with ACS Barker. But it appeared that we had "taken advantage" of the situation - to quote a HI Venture, saying that we had spent more than 30 seconds on the three questions, because the timekeeper had apparently confused the timings for each question - and he demanded that something was done to recoup their losses. (For your information HI was at 2 points at round 1.)  The judges agreed with that suggestion, and declared that round 1 be repeated except that we would not get to take part since we had "taken advantage" of the situation.  By then ACS Barker had taken the lead - 13 to 8.  The end of the quiz came quick - and ACS Barker had&nbsp;built up a substantial lead to land them the champions' trophy.   We were the 1st runner-up, and though we are satisfied with the result I can't say that I was exactly happy about what happened on stage today.  Well, if life was about fairness I'd look like a Caucasian by now.

      I did hear today from someone that I'm unfit to go for PSA.  That's as good as saying that I suck.  To that I say, fine. Fine. It is after all your choice whether you think I'm good or not.

      Wasn't the best start to the morning today, what with yet another downpour and the freezing conditions of the bus.  I couldn't believe I lived to tell the tale of what happened today.  Actually, nothing happened. But that was probably the best thing that could happen.  Ms Lee basically didn't ask us why we had disappeared yesterday; in fact she did not even ask us for proof of our illness, excuses or goodness-knows-what.  What was interesting about today? Bala paraded with his traditional Indian costume for Racial Harmony Day with the company of two (quote) "cooperative" girls - he can't get the Civics thing out of his head, I think.  A narrow majority separated Bala and Ms Ng for the fashion parade (Ms Ng had a very neat baju kurong on herself), but in the end Bala had the best of both worlds - the two girls and the victory of the parade.  Then, of course, a magnificent performance from the Chinese Orchestra. Actually, it was only the flutes that were performing.  Then a very memorable performance by the Malay Cultural Society - if you were there you would have agreed, surely. Whilst doing their dance one of the dancers - who, apparently in her excitement, failed to keep her hair down, literally. One of the dancers probably failed to keep her artificial long hair-tied-into-a-bun properly tied, and what happened was that the next moment we saw a bun of hair on the stage floor and the dancers doing their thing around it.  If that wasn't real hair, at least it provided us with some really good laughs.  The day sailed by quickly, but was probably because I was distracted by the psychadelic fashion parade (and some wardrobe malfunctions) in the lecture theatre.  Certainly, it's easy to forget Maggie - her voice may not be the sweetest, but she fades quickly into the background of my attention.  GP lecture was, as usual, the most interesting one - if only Econs lecturers were that fantastic.  Not that I got a wonderful distinction anyway for my GP.  What's ironic is, I passed Economics.

      Imagine skipping school to do project work.  &nbsp;  I did exactly that and I must admit it left me pondering what good it did.  &nbsp;  You see, our group is admittedly the busiest group, with&nbsp;each person having personal external commitments that can force us to our limits sometimes.  &nbsp;  Especially when your group can only meet up once in the most important month of project work - report writing - and you haven't sorted out those surveys and evaluations yet.  &nbsp;  PW is terrible. The work of the devil.  &nbsp;  Maybe not that bad, but it's pretty much like the inverse of a light-year away.  &nbsp;  Then again, the day wasn't that badly spent. In fact I must say that we were more productive than we were the past few meetings (possibly because everyone was actually present).  &nbsp;  Try to&nbsp;picture this: tomorrow we go to school and we explain our absence by saying that we did project work because we cannot find a suitable day to meet. And Ms Lee accepts it.  &nbsp;  I just can't picture that.  &nbsp;  I predict that the dormant volcano will do some sneezing tomorrow. And it's not just flu. It's full-fledged lava-pneumonia.  &nbsp;  Let's hope I live to update this blog the next day.  And the next.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      I should have predicted it would happen. &nbsp; This morning was a long one. It wasn't just the 5km jog, nor the 1st lap of the 6km walk that I walked and decided to give up halfway because it just wasn't realistic - I said something that I shouldn't have, but was something that I had realised that could happen. &nbsp; Well, Ms Wong gave me the scolding I deserved. But being the idiot that can't seem to open or close his mouth at the right time, I just couldn't open my mouth to apologise. &nbsp; This teacher is no ordinary teacher. She has brought me through four years of Scouting, given me lessons that I will never forget in my life. &nbsp; But it seems that if there was one lesson she hadn't given me, it was for talking without thinking. &nbsp; I rarely spoke to give my opinion during meetings last year, but it was probably a good decision - I'd never make good in ANY useful meeting anyway. &nbsp; How could I have spoken of our batch this way? What right do I have to declare that there is a segregation between President's Scout Award candidates and non-PSA? How could I have even dreamed that the batch would sneer at us? &nbsp; Am I even suitable to take up this responsibility? Do I even have the right to represent the unit to become a candidate? &nbsp; How can a guy that has a phobia of swimming even think of landing it as a PSA holder? &nbsp; I have been too immature, too naive to think that I could ever make it. &nbsp; It has always been my dream, of course, and I will continue to pursue it - but I pray my mouth -and I - can start growing up for a change.

      It looms near.  Tomorrow I will have my first report card from this institution.  I can't say that I am exactly looking forward to it; after all there is nothing exciting about my report card unless you put E equals to exciting. Or O for outstanding and so on.  People are staring again - they think they are looking at the exterior of a great brain at work, but unfortunately I will have to disappoint them yet again. Don't judge a book by its cover, though my cover's pretty tattered - so is my brain, actually.

      Welcome to the real world.  The Monday world.  The world where compositions are but a matter of evidence and words that I appear to lack in my General Paper essay.  Mr. Tony Tan said I was blowing 'hot air' throughout the entire essay, but tell me how not to when you have just finished your lunch and you are on the verge of dozing off on the piece of paper which you seem to mistake to be a piece of white pillow. With green lines of course.  So it's an incredible 18/50 for my essay, which, compared to my Economics essay, is heaven on earth. Try getting 11.  Economics is an intriguing subject, a subject no matter how much I try to dabble in I never seem to be able to get my desired (or even less than desired) mark.  Yet the intrigue seems to be preventing me to fill in a drop-form just yet.  I'll hold out.

      D-Day looms near and I haven't got anything in order.  That's a typical scene on a typical Sunday, though. Well, something happened out of the blue today - I conducted a 40-person survey for the first time in my life.  STOP! You can keep the medal for yourself, thank you very much. It was no great feat. But the start was incredibly difficult. Imagine people just walking past you, thinking that every step you take towards them your aura will pull them towards the Dark Side...   Of course excuses start flooding with their saliva in their mouths. "Busy..." some mutter from the corner of their lips. Some just smile and say "Thanks" when they should have taken the form and giving me the chance to reply. But most prefer to blend into the crowd, knowing that they have absolutely no chance of lowering their conspicuity whatsoever.  Doing surveys at fast-food restaurants is a great idea (of course, if you are lucky enough not to get chased out for doing the same to their customers). Firstly, those people can't possibly run away since they are either waiting for or enjoying their meal.  Secondly, the air conditioner in the restaurant seem to keep the temperature - and their tempers - cool so they don't spit and shout at the poor survey conductor. Believe me, scenarios like the abovementioned become much more common at food centres where the fans are negligible and cigarette smoke gives people adrenaline rushes.  So, I managed to complete the survey drool-free. Then I proceeded to Ling Yi's house, where Hun Ning and I did some pre-class preparations for Sci-Fi and Fantasy elective.  Yeah, you guessed it. We watched Star Wars Episode V and VI. Han Solo is the man, and C-3PO... should be murdered. Then again, droids are usually irritating.

      This wasn't done directly from my mouth, because the original one was cleared away by the site (due to some technical glitches).  As I was saying my head is beginning to pound more nowadays, what with the increased investment in food and the frequency of looking at others' examination results. Only recently I had a headache so bad I can't seem to remember anything that happened on that day.  That was Friday.  The headache seemed to coincide with a terrible day.  All I remember about yesterday was that I broke my test-tube immediately after purchase. Fantastic. Oh yes, and I remember the quote of the day upon telling them of my plight - "So fast?"  They say speed is a virtue, after all. Why you looking at me like that?  Lately I've been more contradicting than usual - yes, the problems that come with immaturity, and I say IM with small I and M. I can't seem to fully concentrate on what I want to do. The worst thing is, sometimes I don't know what I am saying or doing.  The feeling is something like sitting down for the General Paper and thinking of all the points for a Chinese composition.  And I was only rubbishing the idea of open diaries just today. Well, my opinions change rapidly.

      Actually, it's not the head that has caused any pain. You know what I am talking about.  The June holidays have just slipped away like how good things usually go, but HAVE June holidays been good, now? I've been besieged by some crazy fools who prefer to believe in fantasy and trust their hearts instead of their heads.   Barring any unforeseen circumstances, I shouldn't be able to pass my Economics JCT. Dearest Maggie had told the cohort that those that attempted the question on prices - the topic which she only gave out the lecture notes AFTER the test, what a pleasant woman - would have failed, and flunked with magnitude at that.  Rrrrrrright. Yes, headaches.

      Whilst scratching my poor scalp on what would be a more efficent method (or so I thought) of keeping all those previous links that I had visited that would be of use for my Project Work, I decided to create a blog.  I breezed through the first part, what with all the username and password and email address, then got stuck at what is arguably the most important part of the blog - the site name itself. I took some precious time out and, with the aid of the Encarta Dictionary, decided to choose "happenchance".  Happenchance?!?!?!  It doesn't sound the least bit familiar.  It actually means something that happens by chance - the Encarta dictionary defines it as a chance occurrence or event - and like this blog it did happen by chance.  So let's pray that my inspiration doesn't run out here.

      I went for pioneering training today (pioneering is building structures out of wooden poles and manila rope lashing, but it's much more complicated than that), and I realised that those old friendships aren't as strong anymore. Something must have happened, because that inseparable secondary school gang had disappeared. I only saw four individuals instead of four stalwart friends yesterday at dinner, and even so, we seemed more concerned with ourselves than with our peers.  It is difficult to maintain friendships, but it saddens me that such things are unfortunately inevitable.  Such a coincidence; I had to get hold of this song by Keane today.  EVERYBODY'S CHANGING (Keane)  {VERSE} You say you wander your own land But when I think about it I don't see how you can You're aching, you're breaking And I can see the pain in your eyes Says everybody's changing And I don't know why  {CHORUS} So little time Try to understand that I'm Trying to make a move just to stay in the game I try to stay awake and remember my name But everybody's changing and I don't feel the same  (instrumental)  {VERSE} You're gone from here Soon you will disappear Fading into beautiful light 'cos everybody's changing And I don't feel right {CHORUS} So little time Try to understand that I'm Trying to make a move just to stay in the game I try to stay awake and remember my name But everybody's changing and I don't feel the same  So little time Try to understand that I'm Trying to make a move just to stay in the game I try to stay awake and remember my name But everybody's changing and I don't feel the same  ---  Well, maybe it  is  just me. Or is it me that has changed? I need to think about that.

      It's been a long time since I sent in my last actual entry.  To that I apologise to those ardent followers of my blog - those few that I can count with half a finger. I thank you.  In any case, it is terrible to assume that I have been lazing my time away while I have been away from this blog.  It should never be assumed also that I have been using my time with maximised efficiency because that would have been a lie.  Singapore Idol - the first two episodes have been, unfortunately, like its American predecessor - putting almost as much camera-zoom focus on the uncut, uncensored and untalented compared to those that has the power and the vocals.  I'm going back to my seat though.

Excitement added its own gleam to the magical yellowness in his eyes, an emotion so seldom associated with the man even in his younger days, but he could have been a different man then, as he nodded his head in what seemed like agreement.

      Dear Reader,  The first point I would like to make in this article is that I had never wanted to cause grief to anyone - and that my blog is purely entertainment in reading.  My earlier attempts at freelance imagination journalism have been just that - imagination, nothing more.  To prevent others from thinking that I have conflicting ideas, I have hence decided to remove the article on The Establishment.  The second point is, of course, that I would like to apologise to those who have found me irritating, lame, short, ugly, and those bad points, of course. I will give my all to try to reduce the first two properties that I seem to have, but I can't do anything about the latter, though. I can't afford plastic surgery, you know.  I don't make enough money on writing articles on this blog. On the contrary, I think I may get sued and fined.  That's about all for amendments. Thank you for your understanding.

      Like the late founder of Scouting, Lord Baden-Powell did, I am now writing a letter to the world just in case anything happens. It's not really pessimism - I think there have been so many people in my life that I have met and made a difference and I believe that it is time for them to stand out and be recognised.  Firstly, to the part I've been living in - Singapore has been a wonderful home. Yes, ERP, fines and whatnot, but hey, no catastrophes, no war - I'm well-fed, and I'm happy. Thank you so much for giving me the chance to grow and be a part of the culture here.  Then, a tribute to my parents - it's been seventeen years of utterly brilliant education, and most part from your patient teaching. Dad, the canings still hurt, but they will constantly remind me of what I should strive for and what I shouldn't. Mum, you may be 44, but every day I see you I know that my Dad has great taste. To date you are still beautiful to us and your cooking is fantastic as ever.  To my late grandfather - your disease didn't allow you to have a clear mind when you went, and I always blame myself why I did not give you the respect you deserved before you died. Before his struggle with Alzheimer's, he was a tenacious man who married a prominent member of one of the clans in Hainan. Wherever you are now, I hope you will forgive me.  To my primary school teachers - you raised a child who was deemed 'smart' but had 'much room for improvement', and probably you should have added 'incorrigible attitude problem' beside those remarks too. Thank you for all the guidance even when at times those advice you gave seemed negligible, especially Mrs. Ang B.L. and Mr. Michael Lim.  To my primary school friends - I express my warmest heartfelt gratitude to several classmates who have had to withstand my temper and bad behaviour, some for as long as six years. Leonard - who is still in contact with me - was my best friend in primary school and is still one of my closest buddies.  To all who have been mentoring me in Scouting in one way or another - I apologise for giving up on my pursuit for the Chief Commissioner's Award, and I know I wouldn't want to slip up on my last chance now. Ms Wong, you have been amazing in being the compass North in my life.  To my ex-classmates in 1E/2E/3J and 4J - how are all of you doing? It's been a long time since we had a class gathering. My fault that I didn't organise one earlier. It is impossible to name everyone since every single person has made an impact in my life, and not just the most vocal one (yes, Yuan Qing...)  To my current classmates in CG 12/04 in Temasek Junior College - live on and live your lives with passion, purpose and drive. Ms Lee, to be frank, I did not really enjoy your classes during the first three months of JC, but I have slowly grew accustomed and I have grown to respect and like you. You are a good civics tutor and you will thrive in teaching as long as they permit you to stay so.  Mr Chin, thanks for the snooker club and all the enjoyment that we had spending our spare time (and sometimes not) in it.  It may be too little for a letter, so at this point I pray you will forgive my anxiety to complete this; I just want to dedicate this to all who have helped me, and that I am sorry for not including their names in this letter.  TAN WAH CHEN OWEN Signing off (for now) 12.04am, Aug 03 2004
