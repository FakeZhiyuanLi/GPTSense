           I cannot love you because I still love my X. I told you before that I won't go for       a new love if it will not surpass the intensity of the last love I felt.       Don't you even wonder why everytime you ask me if I love you I couldn't give you a       straight answer?       I know... I figured that out cos everytime I'd ask you during our mushy moments       if you love me, all you'd tell me is am happy when I'm with you.       What do you want from me? Tell me.       I don't know. Companionship. I'm not sure. I'm confused.       I told myself... there's a nice guy who's sweet, caring and is offering me a love       that is faithful. But I cannot reciprocate. What's wrong?!       You know why? Cos you still love your X. You can't possibly give something you do not       have.        So what am I then? A shock absorber.       No! No you're not.        Topic sequed to something else...       What if the time doesn't come? And I realized that I cannot love you?       Tell me straight. Just be honest       Will you hate me?       Of course not. I will definitely be hurt. Being rejected is no joke you know. But I       will never hate you.        Will I ever see you again?       You will... In time.       I just need to get over you.       I don't want you to hate me.       I can and will never hate you. All you did was to be honest with me and I appreciate       that.       Let's just see what'll happen next...

      i was offered love,  trust, understanding and fidelity  by the three most wonderful people i came across with...  but still i wandered.  the love i gave  was in many diffferent ways reciprocated at times it was more than what i gave overwhelmed i was... but still i wandered  i am once again offered love... a different love...  a love bordering on romance and friendship a love that is thrustworthy but cannot promise fidelity...

      07.06.Friday  it was my girl friends send-off gathering. she's off to bangkok for work and uncertain when she'll come back. gary v. had a concert on that same day. i was supposed to follow but my other girl friends weren't there yet (whom i haven't seen fora time). oh and the ex was there with his boy. being the honest partner i was, i told HIM who i was with and where i was. surprisingly, HE got pissed. major pissed! he refused to see me told me to go home and don't wana see me. call me a martyr but i'm not into letting a day pass without fixing conflicts. i went home to HIS condo hoping he'd be there after several text messages begging HIM to go home and talk. i got at the condo at around 12mn... texted him begging over and over... intervals: explaining my side. received some harsh replies. still i waited. HE got home at around 5am from bed. fuming mad as if i did something wrong.  he refused to talk about it...   the next morning, he was rubbing it in like it was my fault my ex was there. he didn't give in. i ended up texting my ex telling him for us not to talk... for the eman time. i know it was unfair cos we both moved on already and we're both good friends.  i do not understand how can some people refuse to accept facts. and how they can manage to make it look like it wasn't their fault.  at times i wonder...  is this really worth it...
