      Ugh, why do people get so peety about the frekking things?!  So many people have argued and bitched about the frekking things, myself being one of the many. But it's so annoying, as people can't see anything beyond their own asses. ROAR!  Ugh, first rant over, onto second.  Why is Manhunt being taken off the shelves? It's a playable film, nothing else. If you ban Manhunt, ban Sonic the hedgehog, because it has probably made somebody jump on their best mates head as they can't work out the difference between fiction and reality! MY GOD! THIS WHOLE SITUATION IS BULL! Why can't people open their eyes and stop using computer games as scapegoats...I'm not letting this go.  ROARRRRRRRRR!!!!  ...I'm done.

      Ever tried knocking in a cricket bat?   No, thought not. It's simple, you have a rounded wooden mallet, you have a cricket bat,, yout hit them together. Easy concept yes?   One problem, to fuly knock it in, it needs 12 hours....12 FREAKIN' HOURS! Do you know how boring it gets after the first hour?! MY GOD it hurts my mind!!!   in other news, work experience was cool in the end, builders are really lazy, we were meant to move these pc's from the old surgery to the new one, however it was still a building site. Wondering why it was behind scheduale, I soon found out why...   We were testing all the phone lines up there (because we couldn't obviously move the pcs)   let me set the scene, e-fed roleplay style...    Builder one and builder two were laying stone slabs for a patio. Once they had placed all the full size slabs in place, which took them 20 minutes, they brang over the first slab that needed to be cut using an angle-grinder.     &nbsp;   Builder one then cuts this slab on his wooden blocks, and lays it, taking 5 minutes. Then he turns to builder two and sits down.     &nbsp;  B#1: Gives us a fag mate.   B#2: There yer go, I'll have me a cigar I thinks...    And so the two builders have a chat whilst having a smoke, this lasts for ten minutes, before they finally trot off and get the next slab, and the process is repeated.     &nbsp;  And they wonder why they're behind? Ugh.

      I'll keep this short...  It's really really REALLY bad. Seriously, I've learnt almost nothing, apart from how to network printers. Oh, and how to make decant cups of tea...  ..Yeah, get my point? The only thing so far I could really take with me is how to patch a phone system, not easy, however, gimmie the kit and we'll see how long it takes me to get blown up.  Oh, random news, down the school where I play cricket (About 1min walk from my house) there was a grenade...on my cricket pitch, when I heard them blowing it up I almst cried...luckily they moved it into the sandpit so the pitch was intact!  I'll tell y'all more about when i see you though.

      Well now I have no excuses for breaks, school is OVER!!!!!!!11111111111oneoneoneoneoneone &nbsp; Well, right after i complete my work experience next week, but at least there's not much homework. Apart from a few tasks that involve me running my printing ink dry to the bone, and work, I have nothing left to do. &nbsp; However there is always a flipside, an oppertunity cost if you will. This is the fact that I'm on my own pretty much, for 6 weeks. &nbsp; No Ellie, Becky, Dre, nobody. Seeing them on the off-chance is prbably being hopefull and nieve, and arranging a meet-up is almost impossible. I now have 6 weeks being contained within&nbsp;solitary; cricket and work being my only sanctuaries.  &nbsp; I really am struggling to live this down, as I could have added effort in arranging a meet-up, but it was always flawed.  &nbsp; Hey-ho, now I have time to do stuff I suppose.  &nbsp; Yes...Stuff. &nbsp; &nbsp;

      Well, I'm still having a break from everything. Mainly because I can. I have only two pieces of interest today really...  1. I'm moving back to top set science..ugh, the pressure.  2. Somebody suggested I meet up with you guys, and I laughed at first, but it doesn't seem that bad an idea, so I wrote a small segment of the meeting.  Rob is sat by the CD player, looking very conserved, he wants to turn it on and change the CD, but he knows that his life will be in limbo if he does. Meanwhile, Baha is on a pc, playing on Starcraft, or something like that. Chi, Blitzy, jd and probably Urza are all debateing over music...or another random topic. Zefer is asleep, and Cori is um...well...Cori is doing..something? yeah, something.  After a while, a debate spreads out over another random topic, this time the whole group is involved. After ten minutes, Rob punches Baha, and decides to have a less stressful arguement with anybody else...other than Zefer, he just gets an evil eye.

      After my post yesterday I started to do stuff...like whats on my list, and do you know what? I feel much less stressed out! It's great fun...  Now, let's get on with MotW, and CWA stuffage, wheee... That's the first time I've said that for a while.  Oh yes, on a strange/funny note, my workmate got accidentaly shut in the the cold store today. She's not too clever to know where the release hatch is...when we heard the banging a minute later (she only JUST worked out she got shut in the poxy little store) and let her back out...Very funny experience.

      I have countless things to do right now, this isn't really one of them.  Which makes me ask the question: Why do we hold the most important things off until last?  I mean, look at me, I have the following things to be done:  1. IT coursework- In for Wednesday 2. Graphics Coursework -In for next Friday 3. French Coursework- In for Monday 4. Maths homework- For wednesday  Then  5. CWA match writing 6. More CWA things.  And what am I doing? Playing games, like bootleggers, why?! Ugh, I'm getting so pissed off about all this right now...I blame the summer...even if it is very wet and windy...and thundering. Wow, even summer sucks right now.

      Well these last few days have been eventful.  Heart-wrenching, funny, full of experience, I can't think of too many emotions that have been left out.  However, I'm bored being deeply philisophical, I'm going to talk about fun stuff!!!  Starting with Shrek 2! I mean, come on, it's sooooooooooo cool, it's got loads of big names, a quality donkey, and a loveable puddy-cat! What more could you ask for? Wel;l, a better place to view it, Wells film centre really is...well...ugh...poor...yeah.  Anyway, I was also thinking about this place, you know, the internet? It's just that you can do almost anything now online...and considering how much time I spend on it, how important is it really to an average person's lifestyle? Almost everything is done this way now...taking it away would be mental..no?  Ah screw it, I'm getting to deep again.

      Ok, ok I lied. I know that the weekend has past, but I don't care, I'm not allowed to make deadlines.   So here we go, right now I'm in a good mood, simply because nothing's going wrong, apart from anything to do with Bristol City.  It's crazy is this football. You can play it and not gte worked up, you can watch other teams on the telly, but when it comes to your team, it changes. You become strictly tied to them, and you show emotion, why is this? I can't understand why I can like thios, how many fans around the globe can get like this...strange really.  Wow, that was terribly deep, I should stop doing that.  Anyway, once I've done this coursework, I'll be with y'all.

      Wow, so here we go, the beginning of it all, my life...wow, i can't really see sucess in this, but i'll try anyway.  If this fails it is all Urza's fault, so nyeh.  I will begin tomorrow, if I remember, and if I don't, shoot me, I've wasted good web space, so i hould be shot.  Do I have anything left to say? Not for a while.

Why am i even starting this conversation with you? why am i asking idiotic questions I can't be bothered to answer?  Except that one, that's because I have nothing to say...again.  Apart from wheee, Portugal in a few days!

      Yeah so, I'm probably going to go play it now...Yeah, that sounds like fun.  But if it rains, you have to stop, which sucks...It's not like football, you can play that in all seasons...    Yes...I have nothing to talk about, go away.
