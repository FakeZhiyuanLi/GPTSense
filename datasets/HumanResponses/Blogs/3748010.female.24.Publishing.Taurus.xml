                                         LOS ROQUES  When we thought to talk about a paradise, it was impossible to imagine a wonderful place located in the middle of the Caribbean sea, its name is Los Roques. It’s a place with a huge extension of peaceful waters, small islands and beaches with white sand and crystalline waters with different types of  blue.  Los Roques is an archipelago of Venezuela, located at 168 km (100 miles), north of  La Guaira. In this place you can find 50 coral islands and numerous low reefs. The most important activities are swimming, snorkelling, scuba diving, windsurfing, sailing or just lazing in the sun.  The days are very hot and sunny all year around. The lifestyle is very simple, people visitors stay in small hotel (posadas). Its principal island is call Gran Roque and is the only inhabited island in the archipelago. It has a little fishing village with only three sandy streets of cottages, a nice dive centre, a few little shops.  A ideal guesthouse stay in Los Roques:    Day 1  Take the very early a.m. flight from Caracas to Gran Roques where you will be met and helped transfer to your guesthouse for a two nights stay on a full board basis. Once you’ve dropped off your luggage you head out by boat with a cool box, sun umbrella and deck chairs to explore the archipelago. You are dropped off a pristine beach on one of the nearby islands for swimming, sunbathing and optional snorkelling. In the mid afternoon the boat will return to collect you and transfer you back to Gran Roque. Day 2  Second full day relaxing at Los Roques, transfer by boat to a different part of the island chain for more swimming, sunbathing and optional snorkelling. If you have a PADI or NAUI diving licence you can upgrade this excursion to a day’s diving, two immersions, for an additional charge. Day 3  Third day at Los Roques, taking the boat for a morning of swimming, sunbathing and optional snorkelling before being transferred back to Gran Roque in time for your late afternoon flight back to Caracas. (Arrives too late to connect with most international flights.)
