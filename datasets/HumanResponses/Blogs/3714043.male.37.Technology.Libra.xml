      From the endless sources of frustration...  being kept on hold over 50 minutes on the phone while waiting for 'the next available representative, thank you'...  being yelled at by the nth customer upset with the 'issues' within the software your supposed to defend and support...  from the 40 mph driver your stuck behind on the 65 mph highway your traveling down...  including the aches of a cold mixed well with the short-tempered reactions of a touch of insomnia...  being blown off by friends who wanted to catch the $3.00 cheaper showing(that you cant make) of a movie that you've all waited months and months to go see and now have to see it alone if at all.  Comes a feeling that if you had a little red button that would blow up the world in a fiery glory of brimstone and sulpher, you'd slam that candy-apple red button down without a second thought.  Then in walks my little two year old 'nephew' (really my best friend's son) yelling 'uncle Dave!', with his arms open wide and a huge smile on his face.  Spilling out all his little matchbox cars on the floor and pulling me to the ground next to him. Driving them around on the carpet, handing them to me one by one. Laughing, giggling... Getting up every now and then to where his mom put down his french fries, grabbing one in each hand, walking back to me and the cars, eating one fry and giving me the other. Climbing on me, asking me to put on musica on the computer, playing peek-a-boo, grabbing his favorite book (goodnight moon) and climbing into my lap so I can read it to him, trying to lift the couch pillows and falling on his butt when the weight gets too much and laughing some more, trying to tell little stories about his toys to me in his not-yet-understandable child speak, talking to my bird and calling her beedoo because he cant say bijou yet, running in circles wanting to be chased, climbing under the coffee table and peeking out...  well... It all melts away, it all disappears, life is good again, happy.  I look forward to when I can have some of my own.   urlLink    My instant cheer&nbsp; urlLink

      There have been times in my life when I've thought I've come up with something interesting, something me.  And then something pops up to show how unoriginal I am, how I think like so many before me.  And I just get depressed at the thought that maybe there just isn't anything 'original' to think up anymore.  Sure, there are variations of what's already out there, but nothing original.  I remember one time when I was stoned with some friends, one of them said something that stuck with me.  We were listening to music, and when you're stoned, music is one of the highest places you can go.  He turned to me, and said...  "it's kind of sad about music, there's only a finite amount of compositions you can come up with."  When I was younger I wrote this, sort of, series of fantasy stories centering around a story teller in an inn.  I worked hard on it, long and hard.  I lovingly put a lot of detail in the center piece of the story... And wrote a serial of stories that, although individual, made up a larger story.  I showed it to my friend.  His reply... "Oh, I like this, but it's almost exactly like this book...."  And proceeded to hand me a book off his bookshelf, one I've never read or even seen before.  FUCK!  So what brought this back to mind... I'm going through a little insomnia lately, what having a cold, and working a midnight shift, and wanted to find a picture on the web that sort of captured this feeling, throw it in a post, and write about what insomnia felt like to me...  Well, I must of found about a dozen other blogs called 'the voices in my head' as well as several other blogs that had it's description as 'the voices in my head'.  I know it's not an original idea, hell, it's not even uncommon.  But I thought it would be mine.  Be me.  Be a little different.  Maybe this is what it feels like when you get the first phone book you're going to be in, and your last name is Smith.  I wonder what is was like to see a rose for the first time, and got to be able to name it 'rose'.  Is there any originality left?   urlLink    blah!&nbsp; urlLink

      As I sit here with deliruim setting in from some Nyquil i've taken for a nasty little cold I picked up the other night, I think about how the world would be if imagination could ~bleed~ into the fabric of reality.  If by mere thought realities would change, time-lines shift, alternate lifetimes splinter off...  and nothing helps me indulge more in this fun thinking than the photo below.    urlLink    .&nbsp; urlLink     What if the fantasy could splice into the reality when most unexpected.  Isn't it fun to believe in the absurd and impossible even if just for a little while.  Haven't you ever wished you could go to Jurassic Park for real?  Visit a haunted mansion with ghostly apparitions flying about?  Watch a real UFO with brilliant lights and sounds orchastrated by John Williams come gliding out of the sky to land nearby to visit?  Fly at breakneck speeds through a busy metropolis wearing only a skin tight suit and a cape?  Zombie outbreaks... Magic Carpets... Interstellar spaceships... Time travel...  People wonder why I get so sad sometimes.  There's no ghosts in my computer terminal at work, no aliens landing outside my dreary office, no dinosaurs walking past the windows.  No gremlins on the other end of the phone... just upset customers with computer problems.  Sometimes I envy the coma patient who can live in the constant state of dream.

      Well, being new to the world of blogging, I'm going to jump head first into this.  Throwing open the thickly draped windows of my mind to the unsuspecting world.  And I have to say, one thought just keeps flashing in my mind.    And that's the message in bottle.    The message thats scrawled out on a large tree pond,  scribbled with some available liquid, stuffed into  an old green bottle and capped with thick long cork.  Will anyone ever find this floating in the endless waves of digital data that's slowly engulfing our world?  Let's find out.  Here's to the great Gilligan Experiment. Will someone find me?  Or will I be stuck playing with Harlem Globtrotters in some badly drawn cartoon on my own digital island.  For now, I'll leave you with a link...   urlLink (Click here)

      I see the road before me, but have no clue where it leads.   Pretty much like everything else in my life.  It's a pretty fucked up road.    Come join me as my brain spills misfired synapses.  I promise you this, at times it'll be funny, at times it will be sad, at times it will be exciting, and at times it will be a bore...    So come, take my hand, walk with me...  There's no earthly way of knowing Which direction they are going! There's no knowing where they're rowing, Or which way they river's flowing! Not a speck of light is showing, So the danger must be growing, For the rowers keep on rowing, And they're certainly not showing Any signs that they are slowing...                       -Roald Dahl

      It's been a little bit since I've posted my last update here, and well, other than seeing subterranean, not much has been happening.  I've kinda been in a little bit of a limbo lately.  Work, trying to sleep, watching TV, rinse, repeat.  On the bad side, works been getting kinda crappy.  It's tough when your managers are your friends and the company is going through a rough spot.  One of my managers, who has been a friend of mine for about, I don't know, 10+ years now has thrown himself into his work so much, that that is all he is now.  You cant have a 2 minute conversation with him without it being focused on work.  It's like the friend I had was scooped out inside and replaces with a corporate pamphlet... and you know how fun those are to read in your spare time.  I used to hang out with him a lot, just chill, go for a bite, watch TV.... and I know this sounds crappy, but I don't even want to get phone calls from him anymore cause all we do is talk/bicker/complain about work.  It's like any possible conversation about anything else gets sucked into a black hole the moment the possibility of it gets near us.  I'm getting sick of work, the last thing I want to do is talk about it after work, during meal, in car rides, emails... My company has stolen my friend's soul, and I want it back.      urlLink    Corporate Life&nbsp; urlLink
