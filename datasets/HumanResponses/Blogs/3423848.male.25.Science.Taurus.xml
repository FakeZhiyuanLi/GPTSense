       After four days of my pasta survivor challenge it comes to an end! I must admit that I was having a hard time, knowing that I had to endure another 3 days of a daily diet consisting entirely of 500g of pasta and an enormous amount of tea!  The reason why my little experiment ended was due to a kind friend and co-worker. We were talking about something that has to do with phones?(I can't really remember) but in this course of conversation, he asked whether or not I had straightened things out with payroll and so I told him about my imposed mini-survivor and how excruciating it was to eat pasta and ketchup for breakfast every morning. Well, he felt sorry for me and offered to loan me some cash. So I had to make the choice of breaking of my experiment, and bowing down to fleshly temptation, or continuing, and thereby proving the superiority of my mental powers over my physical desires. Needless to say I ended up borrowing money from him. So tonight I am going to live the life of a high roller and have noodles for dinner or maybe even some sort of microwave dish! Yes, I know it sounds extravagant but I think I deserve it!  The sorry state of my finances gave another, and more unpleasant, kick back today. I have been waiting for 6 weeks now for Amazon UK to get hold of  urlLink Dane Cook 's CD/DVD "Harmful if swallowed" and of course they choose to get hold of it while I am broke! So today I received an email saying that the payment were cancelled. DAMN! I hope that when I am able to pay, hopefully on Tuesday, I don't have to wait another 6 weeks. If you don't know who Dane Cook is then check out his site, link above, or some of his apperances on  urlLink Comedy Central . He's awesome, dude!  And now for something completely different...  urlLink This  most be one of the weirdest stories that happend this week! Come on.. his 10 years old!  And to stay on the same course, it is quite comforting to know that the world is run by competent and  urlLink sober leaders  in a time of crisis!

       Once again the university administration messed up my pay :( Arghhhh... So now I haven't been paid since March! So these days my diet consists mostly of pasta, ketchup and pesto. Hopefully they will figure it out before the weekend... Until then I am approaching this as my newest experiment ; observing the human mind under the stress of an insufficient diet! My own personal survivor! I think the experiment will end with me either crying or over-eating, depending on whether I will be paid soon or not.  Other than the initial disappointment of still being poor, today was actually a very good and nice day:-) I went to Cambridge for a meeting... wow! what a sight! The exact opposite of Mile End. Green and clean! And to make things even more exciting I had lunch at the same table as sir  urlLink Tony Hoare ! He had lunch with my supervisor (and some other Cambridge and Intel people) and I was placed only 3 seats from him! So don't believe them when they say nothing happens in the life of Erik Arne! I wanted to say something smart and really clever, while he was around, but all I could come up with was a joke about Transformers, which by the way sucked.. big time!  Jesus! I am tired! I had to get up at 7.30 this morning to catch the 010 National Express from Mile End to Cambridge :-| So if I want to able to do anything useful tomorrow I should probably head home and get some sleep...  Btw Royal Mail rules! :  urlLink http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/oxfordshire/3746925.stm  Apparently an elderly couple became unpopular with the RM for not given them a tip :)  This only makes things worse for RM after the uproar following the ITV undercover show, aired about a month ago :  urlLink http://www.guardian.co.uk/post/story/0,11489,1206702,00.html

       Finally I did something with my homepage. This time around I have updated the blog and calendar section, even though the calendar is still empty. I have decided not to work out the synchronization palm online-calendar by myself, but instead simply use Yahoo's calendar. I am probably going to synchronize the thing sometime next week, when (hopefully) my new laptop arrives :) I also got rid of my old homemade blog and instead I went with Goggle's "blogger.com", which is actually quite nice. I am thinking about changing the layout of page, but I am probably not going to do it, due to laziness :)  Anyway, that's it for now. Just wanted to get something blogged. But expect frequent blogs from now on...
