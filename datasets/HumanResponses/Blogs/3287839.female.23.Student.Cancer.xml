      I don't know what I'm going to do about her. My little sister born of different blood. Maybe I chose to help out the wrong person. You can't help anyone who doesn't want to be helped. But she's 17, lonely...And everyone has given up on her. I won't do that. What's her main problem? Her mouth, she doesn't know when to close it. Never thinks before she talks. My experiment shows that even she can make a mountain out of a molehill. My experiment...   I feel bad about it. But I must say, gotta protect myself before I can help another...Or maybe that's protect another. I don't know. So I vent to her...Men problems, but not really a big problem. Just a test. And she failed big time. She told everyone MY kool-aid. No she didn't tell exactly just acted...With her mouth. Now I have to clean up spilt kool-aid. And sugar's not fun to clean up...Sticky. Imagine what it would have been like if I actually told her something important. Red wine on White carpet. We don't like those messes. But at least I know now...Thank God I didn't tell her a secret. I couldn't imagine what would've gone wrong.   But now I'm blabbering. So what do I do? I already told her my 2 mottos... 1) I can either be your best friend or your worst enemy & 2) To screw our relationship all you gotta do is mess w/ my money or mess with my man...She's skirting the edge of the latter. So what do I do? Continue to help her of course, I can't be like the others and give up on her. Be strong. I just can't tell her anything. Stick with weather, school, her love life (which is completely sickening as it is...But I'll get into that later), and well her problems. That's it.  CASE: 17 year old female. 5'2" 280lbs. Dirty Blonde...Green eyes.  She reminds me of myself at that age. Ugly inside. Listening to the hurtful words of my peers. "You're a fat B*tch." "You're ugly." "You're a big mouth whore." Nothing that is going to lift her up and help her conquer the world as she sees fit. Yes, I see myself in her...Superimposed. My job? To help her feel worthy...Starting on the inside out. It's a tough job, but someone has to do it.  So I take her under my wing. Help boost her spirits...But they seem to plunge when she's not around me. She hides under a mask. A strong mask of protection. She's a B*tch because she bottles up all her pain, pretends it doesn't exist. Tries to act tough...But she's all gooey inside. A pain filled goo, but goo all the same. I don't lie to her...Because if I lie...Then I'm like the rest of them. So I'm real. A real friend. And I know I can help her because I went through the exact same struggle with my weight...Went from 310 lbs. To 150lbs. But I started with my inner self before I started on the outside. And now I'm a mentor...And I don't know if I can handle this one. Hits close to home...Although I'll learn a great deal more about myself through this journey as well as helping out a pretty girl who doesn't realize her worth. Right now I'm at a loss for personal strength though. She's crossing all sorts of lines and my patience is wearing thin. I need a break. But life never gives breaks.   So what do I do?
