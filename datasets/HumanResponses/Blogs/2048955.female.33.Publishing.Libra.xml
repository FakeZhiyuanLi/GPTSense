      1. allowing people to do, say, or believe something without criticizing or punishing them 2. to be able to accept something unpleasant unpleasant or difficult, even though you do not like it  Example sentence: President Bush vowed earlier this year that he would never tolerate a nuclear North Korea.   Is it possible that in recent months (while Saddam was being dealt with-to ensure he never realized any nuclear capabilities), North Korea has produced one, two , or as many as eight nuclear weapons? I wonder how Mr. Bush defines tolerate?  But more importantly, this doesn't mean I have to put off my planned vacation in Pyongyang, does it?

      Every day I return to my Taipei home, I am greeted by the sight of  Soggy Shubert, the piano. It brings back memories of piano and ballet lessons where I received the same criticism... if only you could learn to count! I CAN count and I could then, too! However, I remember how fun it was to just play without thinking/counting, dance without memorizing steps... it felt like flying!   When I see Shubert, I remember how I could lose myself and my stress in the music and think I should start playing again... but every time I sit down with Shubert, he laughs at me. His former owner, my landlady, left him several humid summers with no air conditioner, no dehumidifier and his sound-board got wet. Now, even after tuning, it is only a matter of weeks before the pegs loosen and... well you can imagine. It is less like flying and more like crawling through...  Anyway, instead of playing the piano, I go dancing at salsa clubs. Well, unfortunately, the Taiwanese way is to take lessons, memorize steps and count in my ear. I'd rather feel the music have "sweet nothings" whispered in my ear (even if I dance badly), but whatever... at least I can leave the counting /memorizing to someone else.

      I am just keeping it short today because I am busy wasting time in other ways! One of my online hobbies (for both personal and professional use) is checking/editing/translating using online dictionaries and translation tools.  My favorite translation site is  urlLink Babel Fish . You can translate from several languages into several other languages. I tried this one with Korean first. I typed in simple phrases and the translations were almost always nearly perfect... even deleting subject pronouns as Korean speakers would... Complicated sentences are another story, however.   Now I use it for other languages, too... languages new to me like Spanish. Unfortunately, not all languages are represented. If you want to translate Serbian, you are out of luck! However, there are always ways around this. Just email me with your Serbian language needs and I will send them to Slovenian friend and translator extraordinaire (I hear she also does Croatian, Italian, German... ) or sign up for  urlLink  on-line Serbian lessons ! This one is fun as you can drag your cursor over the word and hear the meaning... or click the speech bubble to hear the phrase spoken...  Click below to translate this page!

      On October 10th, 1911, the Manchu government was overthrown and the Republic of China was born (in other words-Taiwan). This is a significant holiday here... and lucky for me, due to the fact that my office is kitty-corner to the  urlLink presidential office  (where the festivities and parades are held), the whole building is closed from the evening of the 9th until after the festivities. Unfortunatly I will miss the double ten day events as I don't want to go to my work neighborhood on a day off... particularly not when there will be crowds of people and traffic jams.  Today, however, I got to see the soldiers and police out in full force and various martial arts and other local dance groups practicing for the big day!

      As much as I LOVE my job-I mean I must love it seeing as I am still here after more than two years of overwork and stress- I sometimes want to pack it all up and leave the country. In particularly, during busy periods (like now) I occasionally stop and take time to ponder,  Why is it that the more I have to do, the more I stress and the more I stress, the more I procrastinate?  This is truly perverse as procrastination doesn''t solve the problem of "Will I ever finish?" and results in there being even more to stress about.    I will be sure to put "procrastinate" on my  WHAT NOT TO DO IN MY NEXT LIFE  list!

      Why is it that as as soon as you get "settled" into a new place, either you or your friends move to a new locale and the whole adjusting process starts again? While it is difficult to constantly be saying goodbye, the negative is balanced somewhat by the happy thought that the world shrinks just a little more as the number of places where you have friends grows.     I moved to Taiwan in the winter of 2001. The first person I met was a fellow Canadian waiting for the airport bus into Taipei. We sat together on the airport bus and I discovered she had just transfered to Taipei and was working in the field I was coming here to explore. Who'd have thought 6 months later, I would be working at the same company? Funnier still is that a month into the job, she received a letter from a friend she met on one of her many travels. This friend said that her neighbor's daughter was also working in Taipei and that the neighbor said her daughter was the most responsible, hard-working, blah blah blah girl you'd ever want to meet! How embarrassing it is that it turned out to be MY MOTHER!  It's truly already a small world!    Now that friend is living in Vancouver. Ironically enough, I moved here from Vanouver, but almost none of my University friends remain there anymore and most of the people I know that live in "Vancouver proper" are all people I met in Taiwan! My former Vancouver friends/family are now in LA, London, Toronto, Barbados, etc.    This makes it hard to just call up one of my old (longer-term) friends and meet up for coffee... but it makes planning vacations more interesting. Since one (or more) party will have to travel anyway, we can pick some exotic destination neither has as yet visited. I think it was the Dalai Lama that said that one should try to visit a place one has never been to occasionally... I probably it in one of those annoying PowerPoint chain-mail slide shows that people keep circulating. Hmmm...

      Although I sometimes find it quite amusing to read editorials and news in the  urlLink China Post  or the  urlLink Taipei Times , I feel sometimes that we in Taiwan might be slightly underpriviledged in the limited quantity and quality of news we receive that is NOT related to Taiwan.  I rather miss witty editorials and news magazine articles (who can afford to buy news magazines regularly in Asia at US$10 a pop?)complete with forecasts for the future and maybe even some posed solutions.  Looking for such kind of information, I came across the  urlLink World Press Review Directory of Think-Tanks and NGOs . It has a number of sites with interesting articles on current international topics of interest. You can read about the same issues on different country's think tanks' pages and see the problem from a variety of different viewpoints.  Feeling somewhat removed from Canada these days, I will likely start with the commentary section of the  urlLink Canadian Institute of Strategic Studies .

      Over the weekend, I had the pleasure of joining some other expats at Saint's and Sinners Pub for the going away party for one of our acquaintances. Saints and Sinner's is your typical  American pub ... so generic, it could be picked up and dropped into just about any airport in the world and it wouldn't be misplaced! You know the type - with those old-fashioned American ads that someone obviously produces just for pubs like this one! Anyway, we all ordered. I must say that I must have been in Asia for too long, because I no longer notice if there is mayonnaise and asparagus on my pizza or hello kitty fishcakes floating in my soup. Peanut butter on a ham and egg sandwich? No problem!  This was not the case for some of the others. 3 people ordered cheeseburgers. Two of them ate half before decided the rest wasn't worthy of consumption. The third cheeseburger diner; however, decided this was NOT ACCEPTABLE. Being quite fluent in Chinese, she called over the waiter and ranted at him for about 15 minutes re: the poor quality of the stuff stuck between the two fluffy halves of the bun: What kind of filler was used? What kind of humiliation was inflicted on that ground beef? At first, I watched/listened in morbid fascination! Then a Wendy's commercial from the '80s came to mind and I had to laugh!  urlLink "Where's the beef?"

      Deferral... Why when I hear that word do I feel guilty instead of relieved? Is it because of the close relationship between it's definition (the act of delaying)and that of procrastination?  Anyway, this is the second deferral of the first year of my MA. A word to the wise, do NOT start a distance MA from a University that actually expects you to study if you hold a "company" job anywhere in Taipei as you will likely NEVER find the time. If you are the type to procrastinate (synonym: see delay... Synonym: see defer), don't even think about it! Save your money, quit your job and enroll in an on-campus program. Not only will it be easier, you'll have more fun!  Anyway, my  urlLink university  has been most kind and understanding and I am grateful. Perhaps I will actually manage to complete the assigments this year and spend summer of 2005 in the UK!

                   For the past few months, I have seen a number of dance performances, but NOTHING like what I witnessed tonight! At about 11:30 pm, about 12-15 young Taiwanese women wearing white mini-dresses, white boots, and white masks strutted into the salsa bar. They all moved to one corner, each pulled out a package of cigarettes and struck a pose. They stayed there for about 5 minutes, then strutted to another corner of the bar where they struck another pose. They continued like this until they had covered the whole room. Then the dance floor cleared... probably because the salsa stopped and a dance number came on... The girls filed onto the floor and began their "performance." They took turns doing runway-like struts with turns interspersed with awkward dancing which I think was supposed to look sexy. This continued for about another 5-10 minutes and then they all left the floor single-file and continued on out of the bar.   In Taipei, we are used to the occasional gold-lame Hennesy girl doing the rounds and encouraging people to buy Hennesy... or even the Budweiser girls in their tight tops emblazoned with Budweiser logos and ads. "Hi, care for some beer? Buy 3, get 1 free," etc... but I have NEVER seen anything like this! I doubt a single carton of cigarettes was sold. All the patrons were too busy staring incredulously or laughing. If I were one of those women, I'd be wearing a mask too.

      Well... It has been an interesting waste of time trying to figure out how other people manage to do the things they do on their weblogs. There was a former colleague who showed me how to post pictures... Then, a web-designer friend offered to show me how to make clickable picture thumbnails on a given webpage. Well, I started out trying to find cafes with free wireless internet for our first tutorial... (We went to one far away, but I now know that many cafes in the Shida area -incuding cafe Odeon - have wireless). We met and I discovered I was missing key software - a working version of Photoshop (mine was an expired trial version) and Fireworks. SO... I went to the mac shop to fix this and ended up buying more RAM, installing MORE software and updating my system to the newest spiffiest OS I have used yet! Mac OS 10.3.4  Now I have succeeded in inserting my first clickable thumbnail! Please click on the swimwear picture in the entry on shopping below... Then congratulate me!

      When dancing with someone who is smiling, singing along with the music, and leading gently, it can feel like flying. I love salsa! That said, I am a terrible dancer. My steps are too big. I can rarely spin more than once on the spot without losing balance. And although I don't feel shy to shake and roll my hips in a Latin bar, I feel silly whipping my head and flourishing my hands about in a roomful of serious salsa students.  While I am aware I should learn to follow better, dance with more style and technique- the problem comes with choosing a style and a teacher. I have not yet met a teacher here in Taipei that made me think, "Wow! I want to look like THAT when I dance!" Seeing as I am in Taiwan, I guess I would even settle for a teacher who was nice and focused on helping everyone enjoy themselves. Somehow, it seems so much of the FUN is sucked out by current locale's instructors' infighting and grappling to make money. It seems that even if you are not somebody's paying student, you should still feel welcome in the salsa clubs.   I also don't think people should close themselves to learning new things, trying new styles (especially instructors). Why not learn them all if you have the chance? It can only make you better. Last weekend I had a "salsa experience" that made me want to take lessons in LISTENING!  Listening to music is a whole brain activity. They say that melody is processed in the right hemisphere of  the brain and the beat in the left; but that can be broken down even more to rhythm (left) and meter (right). Students who listen to/play music often score better in school. I dance to the melody, but it  seems to me, percussion is strategic to understanding. After listening, I tried successfully (!!!) dancing on the 2 and it made such logic! It was fluid and gentle. Can't wait to try again.

                         For the first time since1986, I have  lived in the same house for over three years! Ironically,         Taipei        is a place I anticipated only staying in for about 6 months… so I rented a  furnished house as a temporary base. It came complete with all the former  family’s trappings. As you enter the apartment, your eye is struck by a HUGE  family shrine. It sits under a massive triptych of important Buddhist (?)  figures… One that must be    Guanyin , one that appears to be  Damou  ( Daruma  in Japanese)  and  another… all rendered in big black brushstrokes with finer detailing  in read and gold. The effect is quite imposing… if I can get my digital camera  fixed, I will attach a photo at some point. You MUST see this! It is no ordinary  household shrine. The closets are also stuffed with various boxes, trophies,  photos and other old things. The bookshelves contain old piano sheet music, an  assortment of Chinese literature and, funnily enough, a small English  collection: medical books, and a few erotic novels accompanied by some sensual  massage/sex manuals. Actually, the initial attraction to the apartment was the  piano sheet music and the piano (see October archives – soggy soundboards…), but  about 6 months ago, the landlady’s youngest sister took the piano away.             &nbsp;     The rest of the apartment is very  spacious and open: high ceilings, white walls, ceilings and ceramic floor tiles…  big windows. The furnishings consist of a  hodge   podge  of old style bamboo and wood varieties. I rent a room  and the other rooms are rented out to other women (currently one woman from       Southern  Taiwan      and one Japanese woman). The  landlady feels it is still her home and enters unannounced when she feels like  it…. Recently not so often, but more regularly when her parents visit (they live  in LA) as her mother comes to pray at the shrine. Funnily enough, I don’t mind  this, the mother is old enough that she has survived Japanese rule and we can  communicate easily using Japanese. She is friendly and reasonable. Her  daughters, on the other hand, are stingy and difficult. Maybe that is why the  parents choose to live in LA.          &nbsp;     Anyway, the youngest daughter- the  one who “stole” the piano- wants to save money by moving her family to her  parents’ home. So that means we all have to vacate. I hate to move again with so  little time left in       Taiwan      …  as usual, I have the dilemma of whether to think of this as temporary or… Truth  be told, I find I live more happily when I think of my residence as   home   rather  than   temporary dwelling  place  . But if work doesn’t slow down, I may have to use an agency to  do my house hunting for me… or move to a business hotel. Not  good!

      Click on thumbnail to view larger image.                 Let me preface this by stating that I believe in shopping therapy. A new gadget for one's computer, a time-saving kitchen tool, a silly gift to mail an overseas friend, an item of clothing that makes you look years younger and pounds slimmer... whatever! It can take the edge off a bad week.  However, somehow shopping for swimwear seems to have the oposite effect! Nothing theraputic about it. Nothing fits, everything looks terrible under fluorescent lighting, and the horrifying part is you have to come out of the change room to really get a good look... Add to this that if you are a western woman living in Asia and happen to be larger than size 2, you might as well give up now! They probably don't have your size!  Some people I know here in Taiwan shop online, but aside from Amazon.com and Victoria Secrets (I like these ones because you can save money by not ordering, but saving everything in a wish list instead.), I have never really tried as I get frustrated by companies (like Nike) who let you complete the ordering process before telling you that they don't ship to addresses outside the US... nor do they accept foreign credit cards.   Well, this week I discovered virtual shopping. I went to the virtual  urlLink Dressing Room  and tried on several swimsuits before contacting  urlLink Everything But Water  and placing my order. Painless! There are only a few clothing shops doing this, but there should be more! One of my friends says this model looks a bit like me... and hers looks lots like her. I wonder if this will catch on... and what other activities we will be able to do next?

        Note: This silver mama-chari was not mine... just a random picture posted by some happy owner.                 If you have lived in Japan, you probably know what  a  mama-chari  is. It is one of those upright bikes designed so that you  can ride it a skirt of any length with relative ease. They are primarily  black... although in Taiwan, you can get them in pink and lavendar as well (see  the Valentine's Day sale pages of any discount store)! They have a bell attached  to the right handlebar and a big basket in front. They often also have spokes  protruding from the centers of the back wheel for people to stand on when the  owner wants to take on "passengers". If there are no spokes, that is probably  because&nbsp;the bike is already equipt with a "rat trap" over the back wheel  for other ladies in skirts to sit on. (If you have a choice, go for the rat  trap... I once caught my skirt on the spokes and it ripped to shreds before I  could stop the bike. It was a pretty embarrassing&nbsp;ride home.)     I used to enjoy passengering my dignified friend  from Shanghai around Yokohama in this fashion.&nbsp;I went everywhere by   mama chari : Yokohama station, work, home, to the bars, grocery  shopping... etc. &nbsp;Everyone use to warn me that bicycles in Japan are like  umbrellas- interchangeable and pretty much the only item you own likely to be  stolen (aside from underwear - DO not hang your pretty skivies out to dry).  However, in all my 3 years, I never had my bike stolen. I guess I never left it  outside a bar after last call.     Anyway, the title of this entry is "NOT a   mama-chari ". That is because the last FIVE bikes I owned have NOT been   mama-charis  and all of them were stolen: 3 from various places in  Korea... and 2 from MY HOME in Taiwan... and YES they were locked!      I would like to take a little space on this page to  apologize to those bikes for not being even MORE careful. Perhaps I should have  carried them up to the warm dry haven of my apartment every day instead of  leaving them outside to be rained on and rust. Two of five had titanium frames  precisely to allow me to do that. The second to last one was a heavy steel job,  but that one survived being repeatedly driven over by a motor-scooter (someone  must have been having a bad day)... and one crash.     I love having a bike. And by the way, almost ALL  BIKES COME FROM TAIWAN. Hence, you can buy almost any kind of mountain bike here  and go cycling in the less polluted mountaineous&nbsp;outskirts of the smoggy  basin that is Taipei on weekends. So maybe you can understand why&nbsp;I feel  conflicted...&nbsp; Is the trick to buy a  mama-chari  that no one else  would want... or actually just to really carry&nbsp;a better, lighter  bike&nbsp;up 4 flights of stairs every night? Or should I just give up on  bicycles the way I have had to give up on watches? I won't even tell you how  many of those I have lost in the past year.

                     What is the language of love? Some say love needs  no language... or that between two people who are meant to be together, no  language beyond the language of love is needed.&nbsp;Are we to understand  that&nbsp;this language is made up up entirely&nbsp;of glances, gestures, and  other non-verbal kinds of communication?&nbsp;It    all seems very romantic, but I wonder...       &nbsp;    Recently I attended a birthday party for a  Spanish-speaking&nbsp;student celebrating with 50 of his closest friends and his  Japanese girlfriend. She sat leaning against him for most of the early part of  the evening. She spent most on the evening just sitting, only occasionally  punctuating her silence to chat with her girlfriends in Japanese, or to look at  bf with big doe eyes and exchange a few kisses. I asked her if she was studying  Spanish or English... but she said she wasn't - only Chinese... well, this is  Taiwan after all... but neither is he studying Japanese (and she admits she  can't understand his Chinese). Seeing as there really is no common spoken  language they can share, that chemistry must be pretty strong and the language  of love speaking volumes...&nbsp; Certain he said volumes after a bottle of  champagne when he stood up and declared his love for her to the whole room.  Hmmm....      &nbsp;    How important it is to share a language with your  partner? Who should learn whose language... or should the couple both learn the  other's language... or a third/neutral language? Or&nbsp;is it different for  everyone? Are there people who really can communicate without language?        &nbsp;    I remember my first year in Korea. I guess most  people who have lived in a foreign country have had the experience of going on a  few dates with someone who doesn't share&nbsp;their language. I remember the  pleasure and pride of stringing together a sentence and having it be understood  by the other party... drawing pictures, charts and diagrams to make  communication... How flattering it feels when someone has made the effort to  learn a few words/phrases in your language.       &nbsp;    I also remember how frustrating it was not to be  able&nbsp;to&nbsp;learn fast enough... repeatedly try to explain something and  the frustrations mounting to a point where&nbsp;one just has to giggle and give  up... And the profound disappointment on having&nbsp;the achievement  of&nbsp;having sucessfully reached a certain proficiency in the target language  marred by the realization that&nbsp;not only do you have absolutely nothing in  common with your sweetheart... he stands for everything you are against! Hmmm...  ok, maybe it is not always so extreme, but for me... communication is extremely  important.&nbsp;       &nbsp;    I have more to say about this, but I will hold off  until I can update you on the saga of the above birthday boy... Perhaps I will  be able to report that she has learned fluent Spanish from  his&nbsp;friends,&nbsp;that his Japanese is coming right along, and they have  already&nbsp;started&nbsp;teaching their unborn baby Chinese, Japanese, Spanish  AND English.       &nbsp;    Well, this is too long so I will stop here, but  perhaps one day we can also share ideas on  love and language  exchanges .       &nbsp;    &nbsp;

                     Computer troubles! I had to to visit the mac shop  last night. Please don't ask me why I use a mac... I KNOW they are more  expensive (but the  industrial design  is  so... appealing) and I also know that there is less software, less hardware,  less everything designed for this kind of machine... I also know that I don't  fit the mac user profile... (someone who spends long hours getting to know their  machine intimately, who cares enough to completely personalize their machine and  who can speak several kinds of computer languages...&nbsp;).     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forget the computer languages...  for&nbsp;me, I am too&nbsp; busy trying to&nbsp;learn other languages...  namely&nbsp;enough Chinese to get me to my favorite mac shop (on Jin Hua road  between Jinshan and ShingSheng); the one where the customers take in food and  sit around at the counters chatting, using the wireless internet and getting the  staff to teach them a variety of useful things. When I burned a hole in my  motherboard, the staff here managed to scrape the burned bits off and soder on  new ones!     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, this time my problem is  that Dreamweaver (what a great name!), Fireworks and well, all of the Macromedia  package just WON'T install! Last night, we managed to update my system, update  and get Photoshop working again... and consume several green tea cream puffs and  some passion fruit ice cream... but we DIDN'T get the Macromedia package to  install.      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appears I may have to go back  again tonight and leave the laptop there (after creating more space by burning  and deleting all of my photos/music. So annoying... The guy there kept  complaining about how SLOW my machine is... It is only about 3 years old, but of  course all the lastest software is made for all the latest hardware... and hence  that means...  It will soon be time to update  ! This is  the worst part of living in Asia - you&nbsp;pretty much&nbsp;HAVE to keep  updated or you are not compatible! However, this only applied to techno-toys...  In terms of educational philosophies (among other philosophies), it seems many  feel it is much better to stick to the old  ways!

                     Always in search of new sites to get ideas for  work... I LOVE books, sites with quizzes. Ok... so I may use them for a boring  purpose... to make teaching materials, but some are fun in their own right. A  few years ago, I started using  E-mode &nbsp;to get ideas... I think everyone  REALLY needs to know which breed of dog they are (Can it really be possible that  I am a chihuahua?) And as for me, I am glad to know that if I were an umbrella  drink, I would be a daquairi! I also found out that I am right brained, my true  color is green (but the color of my aura is orange). My strongest Chakra is the  5th one (that&nbsp;governing truth and honesty).&nbsp;In my past life, I was a  dog named Scooter living in Iowa.My best quality is my independence...&nbsp;and  the INKBLOT test reveals my subconscious mind is driven by  curiosity.      &nbsp;    However, E-mode has CHANGED! This is very sad  because now it's focus appears not to be&nbsp;on providing quizzes for  the&nbsp;Egoist looking for ways to waste time, but&nbsp;on running an on-line  match-making service and on making money. A couple years ago, all these tests  were free... even the&nbsp;more rigorous ones (like the Briggs Myers inspired  ones etc). Now you only get the initial result free and have to pay for the  details... Paying for the results&nbsp;might seem to&nbsp;indicate that one  takes the results a little too seriously! So&nbsp; now I am on the lookout for  new quiz sites.       &nbsp;    Quizilla is the one I checked out today! I tried a  test to find out which movie I belong in... The surprise is that it is a movie I have  never even seen. But glad to know Jack's creative world fits my curiosity and imagination.       &nbsp;       Nightmare Before Christmas!    urlLink   What movie Do you Belong in?(many different outcomes!)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla   This site is okay, but I am going to keep looking  as I would like to find one that is a little slicker and has fewer typos. I  realize this&nbsp;reveals insidious things&nbsp;about my personality, but I  don't care. Anyway, if anyone can reccommend a god quiz site, please post a  comment. Thanks.

      This is an ancient Chinese Proverb! I have nothing to say about this proverb, but I would like to save it here until it is needed.

        Hezachan,I see you have joined this weblog, but I have yet to see you post! How is Korea these days? Taiwan is getting hotter and more humid every day! Summer is upon us and me still with no summer vacation in sight.     Anyway, what are you up to this weekend? Any exciting plans? I am off to the office soon, so am unlikely to do anything too terribly exciting beyond keeping my office chair rooted to the floor. (Wouldn't want it to float away). Tonight, however, (if not too tired) I may try to get a little exercise - either at the gym or on the dance floor.     Tomorrow, I am looking forward to a wonderful day of grocery shopping and laundry! I still have a package of  kimchi , some  genip , one tub of walnut and anchovy side-dish (don&#8217;t be disgusted), and a container of  samjang  from when I was in Korea last... So I was thinking about actually eating dinner at home! Novetly of novelties!     Why do I never cook? It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t have a kitchen here - it&#8217;s just that I can never find the right utensils, I don&#8217;t have a properly working rice cooker, of course there is no oven &#8211;like Korea, only 2 gas burners... and most importantly, I have NO time. I wonder if I can even remember how to cook. I think the last time was December 2000 in Vancouver! I even made fruitcake that year to celebrate having an oven during the holidays!     Too bad my sojourn back in North America was only 6 months... &nbsp;Do you think the culture shock of being in a place where I could understand what everyone was saying might have been too great? Do you think I will ever truly be able to leave Asia?     Well, hope to hear from you soon...

        Note: Logo copied here without permission.                Do you remember the  Oracle of Starbucks ? Did  you know that the woman who appears to have developed the&nbsp;Oracle&nbsp;also  has a personal weblog? You may also remember that all of the possible outcomes  of drinking ANYTHING at Starbucks is BAD! The sad thing is the Oracle of  Starbucks states that I drink sparkling water and shop in designer grocery  stores... and&nbsp;both of these are true! However, as I don't always drink the  same thing at Starbucks, in addition to&nbsp;my heinous habits,&nbsp;I am also  lame and&nbsp;an asshat (whatever that means). Well,&nbsp;you have to be all  those things&nbsp;to waste $90+ (local currency) every time you drink coffee.  For only $50, you can purchase coffee AND breakfast at the other places.  Luckily, I can drink things not recognized by the Oracle to avoid  categorization: tall double low-fat no-foam half-sweet caramel ice latte;  shaken, no ice!   An accountant I know adviced me  that rather than DRINK Starbucks, I should purchase it! Her stock has doubled!  If only I knew how to do that! Anyway, the point of this blog was not to remind  you of the shame you felt the first time you visited the Oracle, but to point  out that the developer's (if I have miscredited... please correct me)  personal&nbsp;weblog  is as interesting as  the website. The&nbsp;entry&nbsp; a guide to understanding  writers  sounds like me the first time I tried writing something here in  current place of employment!

                     Wednesday Nite, May 12 - Salsa Party at Patio -  9:00pm!    &nbsp;    A friend and I arranged to meet at  Patio   (in the Neo 19 building near  Warner  Village )&nbsp;at 8:00 for dinner followed by a night of dancing.&nbsp;Patio  is across&nbsp;the city from my office, so I&nbsp;left 30 minutes&nbsp;before  the meeting time...&nbsp;One&nbsp;taxi ride later, I&nbsp;arrived to&nbsp;find  out that I had caught my shirt on something and unravelled the bottom hem.  Having come straight from work, I was already looking considerably less than  salsa-sexy!&nbsp; I ran to the nearest shop ( Mango ) to find a quick replacement. As Taiwan  stocks only smaller sizes... and being as a few years in Taiwan (everything  tastes better with a little pork fat, you know?)&nbsp;has increased my dress  size, my options are limited.&nbsp;5 minutes later and with my wallet  considerably lighter, I run to Patio to see if G is there yet. She isn't. The  host leads me to my table. We descend into a sunken retro pit! She shows me to  my circular gray fuzzy chair with a view of the geometric white balastrades and  the light patterns being projected on the ceiling. She also informs me that the  live salsa band won't start until 10:00- an hour later than advertised! (On weeknights, every hour is precious)       &nbsp;    G arrives and we order. The food was only mediocre, the prices were what I have come to expect in Taipei, but the  service... Well I would really like to know what the service charge was for! Not  only did the waiter repeatedly give the wrong dish to the wrong person and  forget to bring us various necessary items, he dropped food in my friend's lap  when clearing the table. Hmmm...      &nbsp;    Anyway, 10:00 arrived (as did many of our "salsa  friends") and we moved into the red lounge area to hear the "live salsa band".  Hmmm... (again). In the first set, the band did not play a single salsa song!  They started with&nbsp;a love balad, then&nbsp;a cumbia number, followed by cha  cha cha and a Ricky Martin cover! We were actually looking forward to the band  taking a break so we could have some salsa.... but it turns out the DJ didn't  have even 1 salsa CD! Salsa Party indeed! We moved the party to  Barrio   before the second set started! And for all you Barrio fans, Barrio has started  charging cover on Wednesday nights! ($300 NT)      &nbsp;    Next Wednesday, I think I'll stay home and dance in  front of the mirror to my iTunes collection.      &nbsp;     &nbsp;     &nbsp;

         Above photo from: urlLink filmographie des serials    Theories like fingerprints... everybody has them .  Money talks. When money talk, few are deaf .  One enemy one too many .  Suspicion is only toy of fools .  To describe bitter medicine will not improve its flavor .  Too soon to count chickens until eggs are in nest .  To speak without thinking is to shoot without aiming .   Wheel of fate has many spokes .  Truth like oil, will in time rise to surface .  Small things sometimes tell big stories.   Problems rarely wait for clearing weather .   Praise in any language very sweet .   Make haste only when withdrawing hand from mouth of tiger .  These are some of Charlie's aphorisms. Actually, I don't know much about Charlie Chan and neither do my Taiwanese teacher friends. Yesterday evening was spend in a meeting in the office with our teacher friends reviewing unit 2. It startes off with a detective story. In every unit, we try to include some interesting fact about something related the the story before we move into more boring grammar exercises. In this unit, we chose a quote from Charlie Chan... but judging from the reactions, perhaps the teachers and students in Taiwan either have never hear of Charlie Chan... or are getting sick of overseas Chinese appearances: Henry C. Lee, Bruce Lee, etc... Is Sherlock Holmes more interesting? Or some fictional teen character: Hardy boys? Nancy Drew? Or the fact that there was no Caroline Keene (author of Nancy Drew) - the books were written by ghost writers? NO ideas what detectives are known to teenagers in Taiwan? Scooby Doo? How difficult might it be to obtain copyright to have a cameo appearance by Scooby Doo? Ideas anyone?

         Well, I am home now listening to Great Big Sea... furthering my education on Maritime music culture! Wow! Very local. The picture above was taken at the Nanaimo Ferry Terminal... but I haven't been to the Atlantic for awhile, so the Pacific will have to do. I can feel the salt water around my ankles as I listen to this. The sounds of Great Big Sea are sounds of skipping stones, but also of running through fields of Goldenrod, maybe throw in some thistles and a few dragonflies... there might also be a twilight whiskey party thrown in for good measure - simple, optimistic, and slightly colonial (can I say that?) Imagine acoustic guitars and concertinas... Together!

      Don't you hate those quizzes entitled, "You know you're ____ when..."? I especially hate it when I read them and find that I am obviously NOT what someone somewhere thought I might be. (Does that make any sense?) After 10 years of living abroad, this often happens. I mean, I only discovered that 24-7 wasn't the name of new convenience store about a year ago! And I don't know the names of any sitcoms that started after 1993 (aside from Sex in the City - HBO airs in Taiwan).  However, just today a repatriated expat (and true Canadian) now living in Vancouver sent me a CD by Great Big Sea. Item 27 on the "You know you're Canadian when..." list runs thusly:  You think Great Big Sea isn't maritime-centric enough.  Have you ever heard of a band from Newfoundland called Great Big Sea? I can't wait to get home and listen to it! I will review it on tomorrow's posting!

      Well, truth be told, I think weblogging is a little hokey! I thought I would try this in order to have a means of keeping a journal... a task I am supposed to do for my Master's degree... and a pursuit I have had on hold now for nearing 2 years. Now over half a year has passed since I made my last entry and NONE of the entries have been about what I am studying! I was excited by blogging only when I found out that html coding was easy enough even for me - self-proclaimed technophobe.   Well, anyway, here I am again. The problem is that I have absolutely nothing profound to offer. I can only offer recent thoughts. Although I am no longer trying to learn Serbian online, I was searching for information on history and the arts in Eastern Europe (after having lengthy conversations re: such with the Russian wife of an American diplomat). Instead I came upon a story of  urlLink Elizabeth Bathory , the Blood Queen of (what was then) Transylvania - a woman who believed the blood of young maidens was the secret to youth.  This was a timely discovery as the movie Van Helsing just opened in Taipei. Normally, I dislike violent movies, but I am always interested to see in which new direction they will take the story each time. I am given pause to wonder what Romanians and Hungarians and all those living near the Carpathians think about what stories Irish Author Bram Stoker and the American film industry have saddled them with.

      A new intern in my office, another person serious about learning languages, recommended this site to me. I use lots of English online dictionaries, but hadn't found a good English-Chinese one yet. (Babelfish only translates...) This site is a GREAT discovery. A new character will appear every few minutes. I have posted that section in my sidebar for all those of you who'd like to learn some Chinese characters. You can click  urlLink here  to go to the main site and use the dictionary/tranlation functions. Or click on a flag in the Babelfish box in the sidebar to translate this whole page into your chosen language.

       Following taken from Knowledge NEWS:    Plato, under the influence of Pythagoras, believed that beauty, architectural and otherwise, was expressed by a mathematical formula called the Golden Section. The formula demanded that the ratio of the shorter part of a given unit to the longer part equal the ratio of the longer part to the whole. And this perfect ratio boils down to 1:1.61803 (about the length of your hand relative to the length of your forearm).  Phidias, Greece's most acclaimed sculptor, applied the Golden Section to his statues of the gods, with divine results. In 1509, Leonardo da Vinci's close chum, the mathematician Luca Pacioli, wrote a three-volume book called De Divina Proportione, which argued that the equation was the cornerstone of all aesthetic endeavor. Some art scholars even believe that Leonardo's Mona Lisa conforms to a version of the formula called the Golden Rectangle.  The 1:1.61803 ratio refuses to go away. In the 1860s, German psychologist Gustav Theodor Fechner put ten rectangles varying in their length-to-width ratios in front of people and asked them to select the most pleasing one. Guess which rectangles ruled? In 1994, a London-based orthodontist updated the experiment, measuring the faces of fashion models. He determined that they satisfied the Greeks' perfect ratio far more closely than the average face.  The latest, most user-friendly incarnation of the theory belongs to retired plastic surgeon Stephen Marquardt. He's devised a mask for applying the Greeks' Golden Section to the face. The closer your features conform to the lines of the mask, the prettier your face, supposedly. As you might imagine, supermodels like Cindy Crawford and Linda Evangelista fit gorgeously. Other folks don't fare so well.

                     In the future, Taiwan plans to  add&nbsp;fingerprints to the backs of ID cards. In some countries this is  already standard.&nbsp;In my&nbsp;second year of Japanese residence, this  feature was added to the alien resgistration cards. I remember feeling slightly  like a criminal as I stood there having my prints taken. (I don't know if  Japanese nationals have fingerprints on theirs). However, in retrospect, it was  more like stamping something with your chop as it wasn't a&nbsp;complete  "fingerprinting". In Korea, my prints were taken&nbsp;properly (although not  reproduced on my card).       &nbsp;       Many Taiwanese are against having their prints on  thier ID card. Recently there has been a scandal over a personal data leak.  Financial agencies and credit investigation agencies leaking personal  date;&nbsp;government investigation agencies bugging telecommunications lines  and searching records... and law enforcement agents abusing power by selling  data gleaned. I am still not sure exactly how and to what extent the "victims"  suffered losses... but they are demanding compensation. There are some calling  up just to find out if they were victimized without their knowledge. Anyway,  people are now asking how they can give&nbsp; their fingerprints to a government  that cannot prevent data leaks.        &nbsp;    Although Taiwan, like much of Asia, is somewhat  cash oriented, the use of credit cards is already more widespread than in other  countries.&nbsp;Many of my Taiwanese&nbsp;have as many as 5 or 6 (they can shift  their debt from one to the other each month to avoid paying any interest). But  what happens when all of society goes plastic and you can pay directly out of  your account as in North America... and&nbsp;a&nbsp;NEC sensor that read prints  directly from your digits rather than relying on ink prints is used as the ID  method rather than a password (the police in Japan&nbsp;is now using this system  of IDing)... or when all personal data is contained on one biometric "smart  card"? Gattica here we come: Identification and passwords which check features  such as irises, veins, vocal pattterns and handwriting.&nbsp;Who knows... maybe  the biomentric smart card will be more secure?

      Seems that this summer I may have to give a seminar re: teaching "festivals" in class. Each time I do one of these I find that I am unable to answer the multitude of questions. A few years ago, I ended up learning lots about Celt history in relation to Halloween. But the questions I received were not about history. People asked things like, "What kind of costumes are popular? Do they all have to be scary?" I wanted to be prepared this time, so I did a little research and it seems the inspiration mostly comes from Holleywood. I mean this is so obvious, but I never noticed before as my friends would dress up as wierd and wacky random things fashioned from whatever materials were at hand. (Plus I have been overseas for 11 years now).  Internet sources say that adults are as much into costumes as kids these days... and that people spend an average of US $55.00 per costume.  Costume sites say that the trend this year will be less gory and more sexy (sexy-classy, stylish). I wonder if 2004 Holleywood costumes below have anything to do with it.          I searched for costumes priced in the $40-$60 dollar range and It would appear they don't even come close to thier Holleywood counterparts. I am thinking that if I am lucky enough to get home for October, I will make my own costume. Maybe I can steal a character from a local producer's film (although NOT from Ang Lee's Hulk!)

                   Last week a friend and I bought a block of tickets for Warner Village (buy 10 and the price is only NT$270 with popcorn and warm, flat soda - as opposed to NT$290 without)! Last year, the popcorn was the best part of most of my movie-going excursions.  This time, however, was different. We used up our first two tickets to see Troy. I have to say, if I had seen this movie before reading the Iliad in high school, I probably wouldn't have found it so hard to struggle through. I would have been too busy picturing Brad Pitt as Achilles (although I don't really remember Achilles having that big a role in Homer's version). The movie was too long and had too many battle scenes for my liking (I have a short attention span), but the battle scenes (and random almost nude scenes) were what Brad did best in this film... I found him unconvincing wherever dialog was involved.  Seeing as mostly only the biggest most mainstream of movies come to Taiwan, I don't feel my critiquing ability to be all that sharp... I will watch anything that's in English (or has English subtitles). However, I thought Troy was completely watchable. Orlando Bloom and Eric Bana  brought plenty of personality to their characters and if the kids in the row behind us hadn't gotten up ever 10 minutes to go to the bathroom, I might have cried when Hector (Bana), and later Priam (Peter O'Toole), died. Somehow, I wasn't quite as moved by Diane Kruger's performance... but WOW! What a wardrobe!  Wasn't Helen supposed to die too? High school was too long ago for me to remember. Anyway, what will really stick with me is the imagery... I guess is that this is what all that big budget was spent on; creating huge armies, ships, etc. etc. The Trojan Horse was more formidable and impressive than I could have imagined. I always pictured a friendlier horse as I thought it was given as a gift... Anyway, click on the pictures above/below (no permission to reproduce these here) for a better view... or rent it when it comes out on DVD. Our next Warner trip takes place tomorrow: Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.

            FAQ: Although standard jewellery in many parts of  the worlds, why do people still question me about my choice of jewellery?    Questions:  1. What do you call that thing?   2. Doesn't it hurt? 3. Do you ever take it out?   4. What do you do if you have a cold?  Can you blow your nose?  5. Why do you wear it? 6. Do you have any other piercings?  My answers:  1. It is called a nose pin.   2. No more than getting your ears  pierced. 3. Of course... got to shine the  diamonds. 4. Note the curving post. This lies  flat inside the nose. That means you can blow your nose with ease.  5. I think it's pretty. Plus, being  as my nose is my best feature, why    shouldn't I draw attention to it? Think of it  as a beauty mark. 6. As if that were anybody's business!
