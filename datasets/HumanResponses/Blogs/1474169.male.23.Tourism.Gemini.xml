The whirlpool is all of my sin, all of my anger that's stored in  bin, all of my hatred, all of my pain, living this lie and going slowly insane.   My life has been a lie, a joke, a shame and I need to remind myself again and again that there's a point to life that I cannot explain, my sin has come back on me it is too late, i cannot get out, i am to blame.   Being sucked down, the water above my head, unable to hear, unable to see, unleashing a scream that will never be heard, a tear coming from under the seam.   Water in my mouth, my nose, my ears, the sin washing over me from the wasted years.

It's a story of abuse, hate, and, sadness, but it's also a story of the love I've found with  Beatific Man .  Hope to post again soon.

         Part 1 Auto-biography     My given name is Derrick Justin Frank, I was born in the early hours of June 8th, 1981 at Holy Cross Hospital in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.  I have only the vaguest memories of my life before I was 6 years old.     I don't remember much of playschool, the thing I remember most is the kindest teacher I had ever had, Mrs. Hopf.  I had trouble associating with my peers and I often did thing alone. I don't know what it was, but i was always too shy to do group activities.    I don't know exactly what age I was when I started grade school, but it was a good experience until I turned six. When I turned six, my life was turned upside down.  My community held a block party and that's where it all began for me.  It began with a friendship, and ended up with me making 4 serious suuicide attempts and almost dying twice.  At the block party, I was having a blast.  I was meeting the neighborhood kids, playing with dogs, and taking in the smells of people cooking on their BBQ's. One boy, who was a few years older than I was, seemed to take an instant liking to me.  Patrick and I started a friendship.  While petting one of the dogs, I was bitten and had to be taken to the hospital for stitches.  Several weeks went by where I saw Patrick almost every day, we'd go to the corner store and he'd buy me toys and candies and junk food. I felt and still sometimes feel that he was the first person in my life to REALLY like me.  I was still six when the first incident happened.  I didn't know exactly what was happening, I didn't se the harm in allowing him to touch my body until i was too late.  I had never learned about appropriate and inappropriate touching and so I thought that it was okay for him to touch me wherever he wanted.  I was sexually abused and raped by Patrick for six years, until I was 12 years old.      During that six years and beyond, my life was a living hell.  At school, my grades were flling, i went from a B+ average to a D, I was having a tough time making friends, I was the kid sitting at the back of the class, because I was being raped, i had a soiling problem and that didn't help too much.  I was being taunted, teased, bullied, and i often ended up running home from school b4 the end of the day, in tears.  I'd come running up the front steps, my mom would see me and it tore her to pieces.  I'd go running to my room and slam the door, and after 10 mins or so, she'd come in and put her arms around me and ask what was wrong, and I'd tell her between sobs.  A lot of the time, neither of my parents were home and so I ran to Patrick's because it seemed like he was always around no matter what.  I'd always end up in his room naked. I didn't realize the effect the sexual abuse was having on me until it was too late, I didn't realize that that's why my grades were falling, why I soiled myself, why I had such a hard time making friends, I thought it was because of  me .  Because of my personality, because I was stupid, it was  never  Patrick's fault.      My first consensual sexual encounter was when I was eight years old.  I was at Camp Gardner with my boy scout troop, and one of the other boys was feeling sick.  Everyone but me and him wer out playing a game, and he said he was  really  cold and he asked if i would get into his sleeping bag with him.  I won't go into too much detail, but things happened.  Just last year, I tried to get in touch with a few of my childhood friends, him being one of them, but he was too ashamed of what had happened between us to talk to me, I can understand where he was coming from though.  He was my best friend when we were kids, but after Camp Gardener we went our seperate ways.      From about grade 3 on, I was called a "sissy" and a "faggot" because I wasn't as aggressive as the other boys, and because of the wasy I tlaked, dressed, and acted.  From grade 2 on, I was a loner, a scapegoat, an outcast.  A lot of the kids in my class didn't even know what they were saying, it was the older kids that were influencing them.       When I was nine years old, Patrick introduced me to some of his "friends", the youngest was 16 and the oldest 24.  There were five of them and they all paid Patrick to have sex with me, all five of them took turns.  Patrick made $600 that night and there was more where that came from.  I "turned tricks" until I was 12 and made Patrick over $3000, i never saw more than $5 of that.    I remember an incident when I was nine, where, Kathryn, Patrick's sister nearly walked in while Patrick was molesting me.  We were in Patrick's bedroom when we heard someone coming down the stairs, Patrick was in bed with me, naked.  We both sat there, I was  really  scared because Ididn't want to get Patrick in trouble, he told me he'd be in  big    trouble if we ever got caught or if I told anyone.  I was scared for myself oo, Patrick told me that I could get in deep trouble if anyone found out.  We heard someone coming down the stairs and Patrick covered us up.  I heard the doorknob turn, but the door didn't open.  There was a soft knock on the door and Patrick said that he was changing, she said "with Derrick in there?", and as she walked away, she said something like boys will be boys.    I liked sports as a kid, and I signed up for hockey when I was 9 and a half years old.   At this time, I was  really  struggling with some things.  I thought of Patrick as my brother, I thought he cared, and even though it sometimes hurt when he touched me, I thought it was normal.  My biological brother started beating me when I was eight, he was eleven.  Rod, my "brother", was always an aggressive kid, he was one of the kids at school encouraging other kids to pick on and bully me, he also sexually abused me.  It started when I was eight, and went untill I was sixteen, by this time, I was too afraid of him to do anything about it,     Whenever I had a hockey game, I'd look at my teammates bodies and wonder where the bruises were.  One day, i got up the courage to ask one of them, whom I knew had a brother, why he didn't have any bruises, and didn't his brother ever hit him, he replied that his brother never laid a finger on him.  The other reason I looked at my teammates bodies, was because I was fascinated with them.    When I was ten, I remember one specific game where my parents and grandparents were in the stands, proud as peacocks of their little goalie.  I was tired that night as I had not slept well the night before, and by the middle of the second period, I was exhausted.  There was a stoppage in play and a faceoff, the puck went to the other end of the ice.  So I laid down on the ice to rest, and got up when the puck came back my way.  I still remeber my parents, my grandparents, a teammates parents, and my coach yelling for me to get up.  That's one of the best memories I have of my life.  In the two years I played hockey, the beatings by my "brother" worsened, because it would "toughen" me up.     I remeber playing "doctor" and other sexual games with my friends before I was eleven, and my second consensual sexual experience when I was eleven.  When I was ten and eleven, I remember having my first sexual responses to the abuse, and to other boys' bodies.    The worst memory I have occured when I was eleven, I watched my best friend committ suicide.  He was thirteen and I often went to his house after school, he often talked about death.  I remember a few days before when he asked me what death was like, how it felt to be dead, he often wondered about things like that out loud even though he knew I didn't have the answer.  On that day, we ate lunch together at school.  All of his friends used the garage door rather then the front door.  I got to the side of the house and noticed that the door was open a little ways so I thought that his dad was working on something.  I pushed the door a little bit and heard the loudest   bang   I had ever heard.  I remember seeing him fall, half of the back of his head gone, the gun in his hand.  I saw blood and some kind of greyish almost jelly with chips of white in it.  I ran to him, cradled him in my arms, and screamed.  Eventually, one of the neighbors came into the garage and saw what had happened, he ran back out, called 911, came back, and put his arm around my shoulders.  I was still screaming when the police and ambulance showed up, someone tried to pull me away, but I wouldn't let go.  They finally pried my grip from my friend but I wouldn't let go.  I kept repeating his name over and over again, gasping for breath.  I finally went to sleep for a little while, and when I woke up, his family was in the next room talking to the police, his little brother, Ryan, came into the room and I started crying.  Ryan got up onto the couch with me, put his arms around me, and cried with me.  I was crushed inside, didn't know which way was up, but I was also aroused because Ryan had his head on my shoulder, and my arms were around him.  Over the next few days, I spent a lot of time at my friend's house, being interviewed by the police.  Ryan was with me the whole time and whenever I started to cry, he put his arms around me and I'd feel  so  good inside,  After a while, I drifted apart from the family, I didn't talk to Ryan but once a month, and finally I stopped talking to him altogether.  This was two months after my eleventh birthday,  It wasn't until I was nearly twelve that I stopped talking to Ryan, when I stopped talking to everyone I loved: my parents, my friends, my teachers, everyone.  I started  isolating myself, locking myself in my room for days at a time.  I hated what was happening to me, I was feeling things and doing things that the church said were wrong.  I learned from my health teacher what homosexuality meant and when I read about it in the Bible, it said all these horrible things would happen if I was gay.  I didn't fully understand it at the time, but I knew enough that I could go to hell because of it.  I didn't tell anyone what was going on, about the thoughts and feelings I was having for other boys.       When I was twelve, a number of significant things were happening.  I was being raped by Patrickm beaten and molested by my "brother", my grades were falling below a D average, I was being picked on and bullied at school, I had maybe two friends to my name, my parents announced that they were getting a divorce (which I blamed myself for), and I was having these very conflicting, confusing thoughts and feelings for other boys.  I was coming into my own, and I started discreetly researching homosexuality, I found more and more supportive literature that told me I was gay.  When I was nearly thirteen, I attempted suicide for the first time.  My dad came home from work to find me near death, hanging from a support beam in the garage.

       Chains               Bound by the chains of my iniquity,          I've had no luck with serendipity,       I live my life wallowing in pity.     Sitting by the ruins of impending doom, my life has been full of darkness and gloom, it's not something you can sweep up with a broom, the pieces too big for a vacuum. I've listened to the tales of peaceful bliss, but fate has not dealt me the fatal kiss, that will let me die without facing this. I've hidden so much, i cannot carry on, until it's dealt with there will be no new dawn, no new chapter of my life, no way i can move on, I've decided I'm going to do my best, to put myself fully to the test, i know it won't be easy, but I have no regrets. There is not going to be an easy way out, no bribe i can make to a person with clout, noo easy road without a doubt.  This is a poem I wrote when I was somewhat depressed and it won me a contest and was published in a magazine.  There are a lot of things in life that I've had to deal with and it hasn't been an easy road, but things are slowly, but surely starting to come together.     I promised that i would post "my story" and I will at some point, i just need to do some thinking and praying about all this.I don't yet know if I am ready to publish some of the details, but I will hopefully be able to bring myself to that point sometime soon.    Beatific Man and I had a good day today, we went to Canmore and had supper and had a view of the Three Sisters Mountain from the restaurant we ate at.  I wanted to get pictures, but neglected to ask a friend, who drove us out there, if he would bring his digital camera.  Anyway I think I'm done for now, but there is more forthcoming.

       Hey Everyone,    This is an email I receieved today, thought it was interesting.    End the Homosexual Genetics Debate  by Wendy Lawrence  Liberals like to complain about a lot of things. Especially liberals here at Swarthmore. But I don't think it is just an inherent desire to whine, I think there's a lot of stuff that's just plain wrong. I'm going to talk about something today that I think is just plain wrong. In a nutshell, I want to discuss why straight people make me mad. Not all of them, of course - my boyfriend's straight and that makes me happy - but a lot of them. Specifically, those who think it is their God-given right to think of homosexuals as less moral, less religious, less qualified, or my personal favorite, less "natural." Even more specifically, I hate the way they have tried to frame the issues surrounding the homosexual rights movement.  I find the argument "it might be genetic" fairly insulting. By itself, it certainly is an interesting question, as I think almost any question about inheritable traits is. But outside of a scientific inquiry, the question of inheritable traits could lead to an answer with serious political and moral consequences. Standing firmly behind the idea that genetic issues do not belong in the political or moral realm, I would go so far as to say that no good at all can come from the current murmurs of "is it genetic?" The most obvious evidence of this comes directly from those who ask the question, the ways in which it is asked and the connotations it carries. Rarely is a group of people sitting around discussing the latest advances in genetics, wondering if our personalities, our emotions our sexual orientation are genetically inheritable.  More likely, it is an excuse. "Well maybe it's in their genes."  As if they really meant "Maybe it isn't their fault."  And this is where I have a big problem. Because the issue of fault should never be considered. Fault, by definition, implies bad.  I would agree that these questions are probably asked by some of the more liberal of the straight population, those at least willing to lend an ear to the issue. And they are even asked by members of the homosexual population. The problem comes when this assumption begins to frame the political movement, as I fear it has.  I love my boyfriend. I'll call him "Jay" for the rest of this article, because well, that's his name. So here I am, loving Jay, and I don't have to be ashamed to say that in a published newsletter. I don't have to be afraid to be seen with him in public.  I doubt that there is a "Jay" gene somewhere in the double helix of nucleotides that makes me who I am. And yet, this should come as a shock to those who ask the genetic question about homosexuals, I'm still allowed to go out with him! Fascinating isn't it, what a liberal world we inhabit?  Some of us, that is....The homosexual movement will go nowhere arguing "it's not their fault, it's genetic." An author in the latest issue of Common Sense makes this clear by arguing that our freedom to choose to get an abortion combined with our knowledge of genetics might someday lead people to abort homosexual children. A fine argument, but a misguided conclusion. That isn't an anti-abortion argument, it's an argument in favor of the acceptance of homosexuals. In a world where homosexuals were accepted, this wouldn't be an issue; the baby would be the child of proud parents. Going on the assumption that aborting children because they are homosexual is not a good thing, a reader of that article must conclude that homosexuals must be accepted in our society.  We cannot accept a society that accepts homosexuals simply because it is "not their fault" - regardless of whether a gene is found or not. Not only does this belief have horrid implications for a world with increasing capabilities of genetic engineering, but it has severe consequences in terms of the ways in which these people are treated in everyday society.  Can you imagine if the African-American rights movement of the 1960's had phrased its ideology in the terms "it's not their fault, it's genetic"? The stalled progress, the misunderstandings, and the misguided attempts to ameliorate racism would have set race relations back twenty years.  Maybe I'm afraid. Afraid of a world where, in order to be Jay's girlfriend I'd have to (a) sequence my DNA for the elusive "Jay" gene, or (b) give up my job, friends, and life. One option sounds impossible, the other ridiculous. And vice-versa.  If you think the above situation sounds ridiculous, you are right. But it's happening. The fact that it wouldn't happen to me does not mean I am morally good, religious, or have particularly superior DNA. It means I'm lucky.  Lucky to be accepted in a society that likes to pick on random groups of people that it deems worth picking on. From a moral standpoint, I don't intend to use my luck to the advantage of others. From a selfish standpoint, I don't want to set a precedent for Uncle Sam in the bedroom.  He seems to get enough of this as it is.

        Part 2 Autobiography      I was barely comatose when he found me and I was ninety seconds from being dead.  In the aftermath of my suicide attempt, I never once revealed any of the abuse.   My parents were finalizing their divorce when we moved out of my childhood home.  I only saw Patrick once afterwe moved on a bus when I was seventeen.  The beatings and molestation by my brother continued.  My heart was torn into a million pieces when my mom moved out.  Eventually, I went with my mom and my brother stayed behind at my dad's.  I often stayed overnight at my dad's on the weekends, so my brother still had plenty of access to me.   I want to go back to when I was ten years old for a moment.  I started stealing and at first, it was a dollar here and there from my parents, but by the time I was thirteen, I had a problem, it got to be five, ten, and twenty dollar bills, not just from my parents, but from my brother, my friends' parents and later on, from extended family.   My first encounter with the law was when I was fourteen.  I had sexually molested a six year old boy behind the church I grew up going to, his dad caught me, and my parens took me to the police station.  The detective we spoke with told me not to do it again and sent me home, that was a  BIG  mistake.  I obviously had problems and wasn't dealing with them appropriately, but I was not offered any counselling or any kind of help for my problems at all, not even a list of counsellors or agencies that could have helped me.  I feel that if I had been given some kind of help at that time, I would not have reoffended.  I had a total of ten offences when I was seventeen, the police know about all of them, but I was only charged for four.   When I was fifteen, I knew I was gay, there was no doubt in my mind.  I joined up with R.C.S.C.C. (Royal Canadian Sea Cadet Corp) Undaunted at H.M.C.S Tehcumseh.  We went on an O.C. (Ordinary Cadet) training camp, which was mandatory if we wanted to get to L.C. (Leading Cadet), the next step up the ladder.  While we were in our cabins "sleeping", I lay awake fantasizing about one of the other cadets.  This cadet just happened to be in the bunk right next to mine.  I crawled over to his bunk and molested him, he woke up, but didn't say anything or do anything to fight me off, I took that as implied consent.  During the summer of 1997, I molested two more boys, aged six and eight.  bout a month later, I slit my wrist because I felt so bad for what I had done.  I committed other offences when I was fifteen and sixteen,but I've suppressed most of the memories.  I attempted suicide twice more by O.D. of my medications (an anti-depressant and an anti-psychotic).  I committed my last offence when I was seventeen.  I had a "relationship" with a thirteen year old boy in a treatment program I was in and they found out about it and had me charged because he was underage.  I haven't had an offence in four years.    When I was eighteen, I attempted suicide again by O.D., I took a bunch of my anti-depressants and some sleeping pills.  I was rushed to the hospital by my brother, who had walked in as I was taking a handfull of pills.    From when I was fifteen, I was hooked on the internet.  I often looked at gay porn, and I was  always  in the chat rooms.  When questioned by my dad about the porn he was finding on his computer, I said I had accidentally stumbled on these sites.  When I was sixteen, I finally laid everything out on the table for my parents, I told them I was gay and that the porn wasn't an accident.  It felt     SO   good to get that off my shoulders after hiding it for so long.  There was no more need to lie about the "friends" I was bringing hoime, about the porn, about who I am.  It was such an overwhelming relief to tell them.  My dad rejected it, but my mom told me that I could bring my boyfriends home for dinner.   Nothing too significant happened when I was nineteenb and twenty, relationships came and went, I attempted suicide again, and I was in and out of jail for breaches of probation.  For the past four years, I've been in and out of jail.  The reasons I keep doing things to sabotage myself are that 1. I felt so guilty for the things I did, I felt like I needed to punish myself, and 2. I was scared of myself, I didn't feel comnfident enough that I wouldn't do it again.   I live my life in fear, especially scince learning that one of my friends was betaen to death (it was a gay bashing incident).  I'm constantly looking over my shoulder wondering who's going to recognize me from those days, wondering where the next blow will come from.  I've considered moving to another province, but I don't want it to seem like I'm running away from my problems, I don't want to live my life in fear, I just want to be left alone.  I've done things in my life that I regret doing, everyone has at some point, but people don't understand that, they don't understand that I hate what I did, they don't understand the pain that I live with because of what I've done.  I'm not saying that my victims don't feel pain, I know all to well that they do, and I'm not trying to take away from that pain or minimize it by what I just said, I'm just being honest with my feelings.  If I could go back and take back everything I did and do it all over, I would.  I've had a hard time coming to terms with the things I've done, the suicide attempts and me going back to jail show that.  There's some days where I don't want to get out of bed in the morning, where I don't want to face the day ahead.  There's nights where I go to sleep wishing that I won't wake up in the morning, but I keep plugging away at life because I know there'll be a day where I'll wake up and say, "It's the start of a new life, I am who I am, I've done what I've done, but that's in the past.  That's what was, not what is," and I know that day is coming soon.   I am now twenty-two years old, and I've realized that there's a   LOT   more to life than steel bars, a toilet, and a bed all in the same toom.  There's a world of opportunites out there and a lot of years left in my life.  It's time that I stop dwelling on the past, and use the opportunites I'm presented with to my advantage.   Well, this is my life.  If you hate me foe it, too bad, you're missing out on a good friendship.  I've changed a   LOT   from what I was, I've gotten the help I need and I'm damn proud that I can say I haven't had an offence in more than four years.  I would enjoy seeing people's feedback on my Shout Outs when they're back up and I hope to be on the net a little more often.

       Two cents  Derrick gave me access to his blog several weeks ago, but I haven't felt the need to comment much...but I thought I'd put in my two cents worth as his partner. Call me weird, but I can't help but hope someone is helped by Justin's story...  He is a man of contradictions, it is true, and he's done things that no one should ever be proud of (as have, if we were to be fully truthful with ourselves, all human beings). But I wanted to put my two cents in and tell you how  I  see him.  I don't think anyone who is comfortable with admitting it can deny that he is one of the cutest young guys you'll ever see. (Mind you, I am biased, but plenty of people agree with me.) He is a sweet, simple guy with an almost childish, teasing manner, and he can't help but flirt! His smile is genuine, and his face is expressive. His eyes are the best part--they twinkle in impish delight, harden in anger, widen in surprise or panic, and smoulder with passion.  He is a very bright person, but he hides his knowledge of literature and the world--or maybe tones it down so as not to alienate others. He can think with the best, but keeps his opinions to himself. He is empathetic, and is street smart in very odd and sometimes profound ways.  Derrick is very wounded, and has difficulty forgiving himself for actual and imagined crimes against humanity. He can be manipulative and narcissistic. He loves others deeply, and yet cannot really bring himself to believe that anyone would find him lovable. He exudes both innocence and experienced sexuality, but sometimes this becomes a problem when the ghosts from his past haunt him.  His experiences have given him, in many ways, a soft heart. I have to say, I am very proud of him for how far he's come, and how much his responses to tricky situations have changed. I believe he underestimates his own healing and how much potential he has. He believes he'll do great things in the world, and so bites off more than he can chew, convinced he can make a real difference; and yet, he is so fragile, prone to despair at the odds that are placed against him.  My own relationship with him has been rocky, in part because of restrictions placed on him by the justice system of the province. I can only pray that both of us will continuously renew our patience and loyalty, doing the best we can to move forward as individuals so that when there is freedom to do so, we can come fully back together.  I wanted to comment, lastly, that my partner loves Jesus Christ, although this is not reflected explicitly in his writings as of yet. He is an accepted child and forgiven son of the Most High God. Some people, reading his biography, may decide in their hearts that Derrick is irredeemable and sick, and what am I doing in his life? But the hope of the Good News that Jesus Christ brought from the Father is that he cares about the ones who are so broken that society wrings its hands in anger or despair, the ones who have been abused and the ones who have been abusers, the ones who have been theives and swindlers and addicts. Jesus Christ lifts those kinds of people out of muck and remakes them as Children and Heirs of the promises of God. This is the man that Derrick is becoming, slowly and painfully true, but I think I'll have fun watching him become himself, and then give the grace in his heart away to others who are just like he was. Watch. It'll happen.  Derrick, I love you.

       Joke!!     This is a joke I found on the net.    A priest, a doctor, and an engineer     A priest, a doctor, and an engineer were waiting at the third tee (par3, 185 yards, slight left dogleg, water hazard on the right) while a particularly slow group of golfers were flailing away ahead of them.       Engineer: What's with these guys? We've been waiting for 15 miutes!       Doctor: I don't know but I've never seen such ineptitude!       Priest: Hey here comes the greens keeper.  Let's have a word with him.       Priest: Hi George. Say George, what's with that group ahead of us? They're reather slow aren't they?       George: Oh yes.  That's a group of blind firefighters.  They lost their sight while saving our clubhouse last year.  So we let them play here anytime free of charge!       Doctor: Wow! Thanks for the scoop George.       Priest: That's so sad.  I think I'll say a special prayer for them tonight.       Doctor: Good idea.  And I'm going to contact my opthamologist buddy and see if there's anything he can do for them.       After a short pause........       Engineer: Why can't these guys play at night?

      Kevin....  I've been waiting for a guy like Kevin for 8 years, pretty much since I came out.  Kevin's a wonderful guy and I can't wait to see what happens with him, he's completely turned my life around.  Before I met him, I was miserable, my life was going down the toilet in a torrent of water, but he's made me feel happy again and I can't thank him enough for it.  In November, I'm taking a BIG trip, but I don't exactly know where I want to go yet.  If things develop, I may go out to Brantford and see him, but right now I need to get to know him better.  I have feelings that I can't even begin to describe for him, and I know that may sound weird, but I haven't met anyone in all the years I've known I'm gay who makes me feel the way he does, I can't describe it, there are no words.   Kevin, I know you may be wondering why I'm writing about you and talking about you and all that.  I like you a LOT and I'm hoping that soon, I can say that you are my Wolfie.  You're a great friend, and I know that I could easily fall in love with you over time.  Talk to you soon.

       The most wonderful thing happened this week.......    Last week was a SHITTY week, got gay bashed, and lost my job because of it, but this week has been AWESOME!!!....I've met the most wonderful guy that I could think of to meet, and I don't yet know where it's gonna go.  He lives in Brantford, Ontario, and I live in Calgary, Alberta, a little distance between us.  I honestly feel like it could work if things develop, but I'm not too sure, all the long distance relationships I've had before have always ended in a lot of pain, but there's something different about this one.  He's smart and funny, and he always manages to make me smile even when I feel like shit.  I get shivers down my spine when I talk to him and I can't stop thinking about him at times.  All day at work today, I was thinking about him and I've been SOOOO happy all day.  I kinda wish we lived in closer proximity, but circumstances are such that it's not possible at the moment.  I was planning to take a trip to Ontario in November anyways, but the person I'm going there to see is now going to be someone different.  The person I'm now going to be meeting is someone that I hope will be a VERY important, even integral part of my life and I hope that circumstances will change to such that either he can eventually move out here, or I out there.  I don't know, it feels like he may be someone that I could build a meaningful relationship with.
