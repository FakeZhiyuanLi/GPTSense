      So I've spent the past 6 hours helping my mother in law clean up her wreck of a basement...There's still HUGE piles left everywhere.  I don't know how they're going to get it all done in the next week.  Okay. Time for a mini-rant, boys and girls.  Can you say pissed off?  J's brother's wedding is June 5th.  J is the best man, her sister is the matron of honor.  Among many other friends etc... her brother in law is also a groomsman.  I am J's brother's sister in law, obviously.  I am the ONLY family member not in the wedding.  The fact that I'm not a bridesmaid isn't what bothers me. What bothers me is that I'm the only family member not involved. I've been completely left out. I cannot ride in the limo with everyone, and I have to spend the day alone.  My husband will be away from me during the ENTIRE night, as he is sitting at the head table and I'm not, and he also is supposed to be dancing with the matron of honor (though he claims he will NOT under any circumstances).  So. I won't sit with him or be with him during the wedding, I can't ride with him to reception as the wedding party is going to the lake for pictures, I don't get to sit with him for dinner, and I don't get to dance with him.  I think it's really crappy that I'm so left out.  Okay, I AM singing in the wedding-the only person to sing.  I'd rather be doing that than standing up as a bridesmaid.  But I don't understand why I can't be included. A letter arrived yesterday for J saying where he had to be and when and, with regards to the limo for after-pictures, that spouses were NOT allowed to ride along.  Maybe I'm just grumpy.  Who knows. /endrant  Okay.  Tomorrow the window is fixed in the bathroom and we are to have the kitchen table and chairs delivered. I certainly hope that I don't have a class scheduled for when they are supposed to arrive! I'm going to be really pissed.  Not much I can do though...and...I'M GETTING A TABLE AND CHAIRS!!! HALLELUJAH!! :)  Okay. I think I'm done for now. Hooray!

      How do you forget you have a blog?  I don't know but I did.  Anyway, I got my Sheriff's badge today from the re-election campain that says:   Wrangler  Re-elect  Bush  Cheney  2004  or something like that.  anyway, I wore it tonight out. I love it!  I can't wait for someone to make some snide comment...and I can knock them over by telling them I've already donated to his campaign and am about to again.  ha!  Anyway.  Been doing a lot of organizing before the family gets here next weekend.  My brother-in-law's wedding is on Saturday the 5th of June and my parents, brother, and sister-in-law will be here this coming Saturday or Sunday or something.  I got all the closets organized, the basement shelving unit fixed up so everything fits on it, the pantry organized, and ... and oh...laundry!  Tomorrow I'd love to get the valances for the family room done...or rather, re-done.  I did one and, according to J, it looks like a hotel room valance. :)  So much for doing them THAT way then. :) I'm trying to come up with another way to use the fabric I already used on this one without wasting it.  Let's see...anything else? School's done in 2 1/2 weeks...hooray!  Then I start summer school...taking a class twice a week for 4 hours.  I may also get to work for the Johnson's Wax daycare center this summer teaching their kindergarten and first graders French.  It should be fun :).  I get paid whatever I ask for...and I get to work as often as I want.  Hooray extra cash! :)  Well, I think I'm out of time.  Enjoy and have a good night.

      Well.  Here I am.  Posting the first post.  Not much to say except that my old Blog is DEAD...completely DEAD.  I took it down.  So here I am, starting anew....Yup. Don't know what to say.  I'm singing in my brother-in-law's wedding in June. I went to practice the music for the first time tonight and I must say that it's going to be quite easy if I look at it at least once between now and then. :)  Today at work while I was in the middle of having my Kindergarteners do the pledge, the power went out.  Evidently there was some sailboat that clipped a power line and took out power to the entire ghetto.  We were only without for about 30 seconds or so but most of the neighborhood was out for the afternoon.  Hm. What else?  House is doing great.  We've got all the blinds up and curtains up everywhere.  I just have valances to finish for the kitchen and our living room.  Well...start, that is, not finish. :)  I think that's it for now.  If I think of anything else interesting I shall let you know. Fer Sher, Man. :)

      The furniture arrives today, sometime between 10 and 6...and of course, here I am, still lying in the floor-bed. :)  Oh well. I have plenty of time to move stuff and vaccuum to make sure the floor's nice and clean. :)  My weekend started yesterday at about 11am or so...and I have nothing planned.  Except playing with money to figure out how much we can send to the various bills.  What fun! :) NOT.  The only money we have spent in this last 2 weeks has been on gas and food...I'm hoping to be able to do the same thing for the next couple months and send as much as possible to the credit cards so we can get them paid down...They're not that high (we have two with money on them-one is mine, one is his) but we've got other things that need to be put on there...So here we go.    Hm. Not much else to report.  I went to try and pick up my brother and sister-in-law's mail but there was none on either day when I went. I have a feeling my mother-in-law got it herself.  She never trusts me to do anything.  Figures.  I think I'm going to make pasta fagioli soup tonight. I haven't decided for sure. It all depends on if it's raining or not by the time the day is done.  I don't want to feed J hot soup if it's 80 out.  Right now it's 55 and really cloudy. Last night we had some nasty storms come through and he was up well after 11pm. He's normally up until 10 at the latest. :(  Someone from the Tricourse tournament contacted J to see if he'd be interested in playing this year.  This is a tournament where they play at one of the pub links courses in town and the next two days at each of the country clubs.  One year he placed 9th so they called him to see if he'd play again. I personally think it's because they're low on entrants.  Either way, it was neat that they actually called him to see if he'd play!  I hope he does well.  The last time I walked the tournament with him, he didn't do very well...it wasn't "bad" but I think he placed in the 30's or 50's or something.  It was a rough year. He's not played since then because we were living in Seattle or outside Racine County.  Hm. Anything else?  Not really. I really should get up and get a shower, move the bed out and all that garbage...I'm so unmotivated!!!  woooooooooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOooooooooooooooooOOOOOOOOO. ahem. :)  bye bye.

      Well,another weekend draws to a close. Nevermind the fact that my weekends have turned into 4 1/2 day entertainment extravaganzas. :) This was a pretty good weekend. J came home early on Friday and we hung out and watched golf. Yesterday we drove down to the Chicago suburbs to go to a golf shop and IKEA. I got some organizers for my scrapbooking stuff and kitchen drawers, while J got a shaft extracter and some tees. He's going to be reshafting all of his golf clubs whenever the shafts are ordered and delivered. :)  Yay. Another thing to blow $500 on.  As if we haven't spent enough money in the last 3 months, and as if we don't have enough to spend over the next year...blah.  Today we went over to his parent's house for a bit for Father's Day since his dad was leaving town at 1pm for work.  We came home and have been watching the U.S. Open golf tournament ever since.  Phil Mickelson and Retief Goosen are taking turns at who's in the lead at the moment. I can't stand it!  This should be a really quiet week. I have class on Monday and Wednesday morning and I plan on calling the furniture place to find out why it's taken our 8 wk max delivery furniture 13  1/2 weeks to arrive...and it's still not here yet. I'm going to see if they'll give us a discount on what we bought.  No other news to report.  :) Dinner tonight was grilled stuffed burritos...home made. :) Hooray!

      Hooray! It's Friday!  At least for me.  Today was my last day of the week I had any plans. On the REAL Friday they are coming to replace a few things at the house but not until 1pm so I can at least sleep in all I want.  This whole getting up at 7am thing sucks. Bad.  My class is so far quite easy, though I may change my mind after the first test.  We have to write an 8-10 page paper and do a presentation in class-the ONE THING I didn't want to do.  Yesterday I went up to Stritch to register for my fall class (that ONE class will cost me almost 1500 bucks! GAH!).  It was a pleasant trip until the ride home hit a ONE HOUR delay because a semi driver had an asthma attack and flipped his truck on the highway...Oops.  I could've gone a different way but I had no other plans for the day and the morbid curiosity bug hit me...so I stayed and got to see the show first hand. Luckily, the driver was fine after a short trip to the hospital to treat his asthma.  Not much else to report.  I have been taking naps every day for the last week...mmm...naps. :)  My back has gotten worse but better-more spots showed up but they're not as red and not quite as itchy and painful now... I hope they go away soon. I've heard every diagnosis from poison ivy/oak to shingles. Who knows!   urlLink My back...2 days ago (it's a bit better now)   the PW is Gen if it won't let you in.  WAHA. :)

      Well. I had a fun weekend. Sort of.  But. Tomorrow, school starts. Yes, that was a short summer vacation, wasn't it?  I am taking a class at a local school that I have already taken but that I have to take to keep my emergency teaching license. It meets every Monday and Wednesday from 8-12 from now until the first part of August.  I'm NOT looking forward to getting up before 7am twice a week just to take this silly class but there's not much I can do.  In other news...  I have some NASTY looking bug bites. I'm not sure exactly what I did or how they got there, but I believe they're spider related...View the horror:   urlLink My nasty bites...   It's gotten so bad now that it actually hurts to move my left side (that picture's taken in the mirror-reverse image).  I can't bend over, I can't stretch, and I can't turn.  I hope this doesn't last forever. (PS-like my flowered PJ shorts??)  Went to one of J's friend's weddings yesterday. He's an old college buddy and BOY did we feel out of place!  We left the reception (that had started at 5) just after 7pm and dinner. :)  Hm. Not much else to report.  I hope that this 4 hour class isn't as boring as I think it's going to be and I certainly hope they give us breaks or at least let us have food to eat while we're there.  So. Until later...toodle-oo :)

      Well, Hallelujah. It's OVER.  I've never been happier for something to be done.  I survived yesterday but it was a really sucky day, if I may say so. I sang fine and the ceremony went great.  I ended up in 2 pictures of the like 500 the guy took.  J said he'd ride with me behind the limo bus to the photo place by the lake.  He didn't.  After the photos, he said he'd ride with me to the reception.  He didn't.  He said at the reception that he wasn't dancing with the matron of honor during the wedding party dance. He did.  I realize he had to do these things. I knew that from the beginning.  I just couldn't handle it though. From the lake where they took photos to the reception, I cried the entire way...and I was the one driving. By myself.    So we get to the reception, he sits up at the head table and I sit with my family, another family and one of J's co-workers, dubbed my "date" by me. After the dinner was over, J came and hung out with us the rest of the night except where he had to get on all fours for the bride to sit on his back while the groom took off her garter (insert a snorting noise here).  Sooooo...my parents left, J's co-worker got plastered and made us laugh all night.  We moved closer to the dance floor as the table we were at was in the opposite corner of the room, and just watched.  We stayed until about midnight and then took his friend to a local bar and dropped his car at another friend's house.  We had a great time once all the crap got out of the way...Some photos are on here somehwere...   urlLink J and me at the reception   urlLink J and me at the rehearsal dinner   urlLink With the bride and groom   urlLink J's co-worker enjoys his fourth bottle of spumanti...   My family has all left. Thank goodness.  I don't mind them being here but there was just too much going on to have everyone at the house at once.  We went this afternoon to Sears to get $100 back on the grill we bought a few weeks back-it went on sale! Hooray! :0  Annnnndddd... I'm spent.

      Well, Well, Well.  It's Wednesday. Again.  My family is in town (parents, brother, and his wife) but sort of not. They got here on Sunday and have been in and out the entire time they've been here.  Yesterday they went to Chicago, today to Madison. My parents will come back tonight but bro and sister in law will not be back until tomorrow night.    My brother-in-law's wedding is this Saturday. I'm going to go practice my singing tonight for the last time before the wedding. I certainly hope I don't screw things up!  I'm beginning to wonder if I'm going to be able to make it through the ceremony without my voice cracking or wavering...I certainly hope I can do it.  I need to get the papers put together on something better so they don't go flying while I'm trying to sing. That would be a BAD thing. :)  Still bothered that I'm not considered "wedding party" but there's nothing I can do about it.  We got our new kitchen table last Friday and it looks awesome.  I wonder if I have brain enough figure out how to put a picture up. Hm.  Perhaps look here for a link at the end.  If it asks for a password, it's Gen.  Aside from all that, there's really not a whole lot going on.  Tomorrow and Friday I am having parties for my first grade French students.  We should have a good time-I am introducing them to some French foods and we're going to play games like pin the flag on the eiffel tower and the like. Hooray! :)  Time to go...J's almost home and he'll be hungry...   urlLink My table, half the chairs recovered

      I've been sorta busy. Sorry.  :)  My class's last meeting is tomorrow (hooray!) and I have been working on my paper among other things.  We painted the living room and I got some really nice frames for the pictures I had up there so look soon for some pictures of the livingroom!  We also got our tables in. Finally!    In other news... uhm...there is none! That I can think of... Hm. Our birthdays went well, got money toward our landscaping...and this afternoon...our NEIGHBOR..mowed our WEEDS. Swear to goodness. There he was, on his riding lawn mower, going to town in our back yard.  He was checking for low spots because he had extra fill dirt or something. I dunno. Either way, he did our whole yard...so now we have a weed lawn! yay! :)    end of story. :) I'm spent. :)

      I stayed up until 3 last night... I looked like this when my mother in law woke me up at 8:30 with the phone:  >_  Went to the parade (yay!), came home and had lunch, finished J's golf clubs, went to the store to buy fabric, made a CUTE new purse!   Linky--> urlLink Outside!  Linky--> urlLink Inside!   I can't wait to make more and do things like add POCKETS and stuff...change the ways the purse strap goes, different closures etc... :)  Sorry folks, if you want the new password, you have to IM me.  Stalkers are idiots. SO if you don't have my IM, you can't get the password. :P  Yay, me! :)  Other than that, I have nothing new to say. ;)  We're not going to the fireworks this evening but that's okay...because it is 58 frickin' degrees out here. It never topped 65 degrees today...stupid 4th of July weekend Wisconsin weather. :( boo.

      Hello, everybody!  I wasn't expecting to have quite the day I did. I woke up this morning, intending on going to summerfest...Instead, we ended up having J's family and his co-worker (see an earlier post-the guy with the bottle).  Didn't even decide to do it until about 2:30...so we hit the grocery store, dropped 60 bucks, came home, and started making stuff.  I made a yellow cake with chocolate frosting, we had cole slaw, potato salad, baked beans, fruit salad, burgers, hot dogs, chips, and Rotel dip.  All in all, it was pretty good.  I don't have class tomorrow because of the holidays, but J has to work for about half a day.  I plan on going to the parade, probably with my mother-in-law, partly to see J's co-worker on the Modine parade float.  He'll be the only guy among 20 women or so!! Ha!    I've been trying to practice for my French exam I have to take in September. I'm NOT lookig forward to it, and I'm half scared I will fail.  It's a VERY difficult test it seems-listening to a non-native speaker say a sentence in French (with no visual help) and figuring out what their error was.  Ugh.  Please please, dear God, let me pass this test-if I don't, I can't student teach in the spring which means no license for me.  Let's see, what else?  I think that's it, really. Yay.

I only broke 1 needle, 1 presser foot (the embroidery one during the topstitching), and the plate that covers the feed dogs....figures.
