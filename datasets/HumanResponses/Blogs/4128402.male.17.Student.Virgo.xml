      Before i start, im completely pished, so i apologise for my poor spelling and crap grammer, and the fact tht everything im about to say will be indeciferable (is tht a word???).  Right well, the night was decent. Got very pished, had a few laughs wae cooney and many little asides about the pish my family talks. But.. the real shock came with a couple of texts from both danny and, gasp, claire.  Danny and johann had wemt to ashleighs party but it ended early i imagine so they text ,e and asked to cp,e to my brothers thing, to which i obliged. So they both came and it was all good. But then,, claire text me and asked if her, pauline (!!!!) and carolann cld come as well, to which i jumped at the chance as u wld imagine. So they turned up and my night was complete. I was already slaughterred by the time they got there and i dont even remember what i was saying at all but it was cool, dont think i made too much of an arse of myself. Anyway, after the night was over and they all went home i was completely abandoned by my family and left with some obscure family members tht i dont really know, which was rather uncomfortable. I was meant to be going to Capos with all of them but seeing as i dint know them i decided jst to go home, prob much to the annoyance of the ppl i was with who wanted to continue the night and not be stuck with a wee guy like me. Does any of this make sense? I cant even read this back to myself so ill not even try. Ill wake in the morning and try to decifer this but to no avail. Bye anyway.

      And lo i make my illustrious return to your screens after 3 days of exile. And no my lack of blogging was not the result of an unfortunate smelting incident, kidnap by a flange of baboons or because i had gone to ground after the events of this past saturday, but merely my computer is jobbies and refused to comply with my commands this past week. But now all is well and my stream of consciousness can resume. So, what have i been up to during my exodus i hear you ask with baited breath? Fuck all comes the loud reply. I went to glasgow yesterday to look at guitars well out of my price range and i spent my evenings watching the Godfather trilogy, which was rather good i must say, although part 3 is largely testes. Tomorrow im being taken against my will and better judgement to some family shindig which i can tell you right now will be pish. My family are not the best people to gather together in the one room. There will be serious bitching behind backs, false smiles and eyes of daggers. Its total hypocracy and im going to be sitting there witnessing it all, and of course the next day it wont be mentioned, all the back stabbing will be swept under the carpet and people will pretend as usual that its all rosy. What pish. I would be so much happier if everyone in the world who doesnt like someone else, rather than put on some facade or worse, be honest to each other and have a full blown fight thereby embarrassing themselves and me, just to ignore each other. Dont even make eye contact. Of such things my dreams are made. But the reality is that my brothers girlfriend (who is a tad older than him) will be the focus of most of said backstabbing seeing as my mother does not approve of the age difference, or, god forbid, my auntie shows up like she did the other night. It will be war i promise you. In an attempt to make tomorrow night more bearable i started asking around for some friends to go but i gave up when the first 2 i asked had prior engagments, poking bum or otherwise (tashleighs party) and just as i had resigned myself to defeat young nickolai stepped up to the plate and said he would accompany me. Joy, rapture. At least now although i shant be a total nigel, my turning up with a friend rather than a date will attract awkward looks from family members as they jump to conclusions as regards my (in their opinion) already ambiguous sexuality. A fun filled evening indeed. It might not be as bad as i fear, but i'll ready the battalion for the worst nonetheless. By the way im quitting my job. As soon as i find something else im upping sticks. The managers are fannies, they dont care about their staff and dont heed their questions or complaints, so fuck them. Young Downey has also joined the unemployed masses after he told them where to go when they refused him a night off for some shitey reason, they blamed him for a mistake being made that wasnt his fault so he left, and a round of applause was garnered. My main reason for leaving is that even though i've asked twice now for any overtime available to be sent my way they've bypassed my pleas and gave the work to Robert as always, that boy might as well live there he spends so much time in the place, im sure he really lives in a tent in the carpark and just returns home for a shower now and again, its unbelievable. So if they dont care for my work ethic enough to send some extra hours my way they can jump up my arse and die. The job hunt begins in earnest this monday. Well im offski, i'll regail my tale of woe from tomorrow night soon no doubt.

      A reflective entry tonight as last nights ramblings were a tad disjointed/bollocks. So yes it is true, last night was good. Despite getting a bit fucked up over Ms H the night was a success. I got twatted, had a laugh and a bit of a singsong, played in the adventure playground, got eyed up many a time by the police and even negotiated a pishy lookin roll up with ease. Result. Anyway I wont go into further detail about my thoughts and whatnot on said girl, trying to rebuff all that these days, I was doing so well! Anyhoo, executing a swift change of subject, the Libertines are number 2 in the charts as we speak, fucking amazing.  Hopefully now when i try to recruit more disciples to the cause i wont get as many blank expressions as a reply.  The Libertines are gospel and all heathens shall be punished in hell, the chart placing is surely testament to not only the bands solid fanbase but also to their amazing songwriting and ability to pen a classic pop song. I can just pray they keep it together long enough to witness their successes rather than acheive cult status after the death of Pete which, it must be said, is only a matter of time, unfortunately.  I had a hangover this morning, thats the first in a long time, didnt have my staple breakfast of Rice Krispies, thats how bad i was feeling! Only in times of crisis do I skip the ever-present cereal in the morning. As a result im starving the now so i'll go seek nourishment. Ta-ra.

      It seems that i have fallen back into  my bad old ways. Tonight we all went for a bit of a knees up at Franklyns and, although it was a class nite and everyone seemed to have a good time, i found myself once again infatuated with a young femme fatale by the name of....well most of you know already so i shant divulge the name so as to avoid further embarassment in the morning when i realise what ive done. Anyway, all you really need to know is that in 6th year i got completely fucked up coz i thought this girl was amazing and tonight all those thoughts came aflooding back, she really did look great tonight though so its to be expected. Anyway as soon as i saw her i knew i was going to get really depressed tonight so i thought i would counteract this depression by getting monged out my tits on various alcoholic beverages, and in most ways i succeeded. So after many a southern comfort/miller/vodka/ medouri (dunno how to spell tht) im here at home barely able to see straight and im well tired so ill retire to my chamber. None of this will make sense to those who read it i know and most likely ill wonder what the fuck i was on about in the the morning so pay it no heed. I hink downey and vosilius were talkin pish about me to some lassie tonight tht darren knows jst coz i said tht she was nice looking or something, i dunno im sloshed. Apologies if this actually happened, im away cya.

      The night out that never was. Tonight WILL give new meaning to the word anti-climax. I had my suspicions that the night would end up blowing goats, but never could i have forseen such blowage.  We were meant to be going to young Breebs' birthday bash at Rileys but when we showed up we noticed that half of those who were meant to be there hadn't got in as they had no membership and those who did get in were largely bawbags so we decided to make a sneaky exit and head to Franklyns. Imagine the dismay when we discovered that people were being ID'd. IN FRANKLYNS????????!!!!!!! The world had cleary gone topsy-turvy, so Captain Downey suggested we go back to his house for a few seeing as he has an empty, a novel idea we all thought.  However...Downey is clearly holding fort under aforementioned thumb and as soon as the wife cracked the whip all bets were off, plans were changed and it was now him and the missus goin back to his while me and Darren were left in the lurch a peach in Bellshill at half 11 with nowhere to go and no drink.  GIMP! I wouldnt even have minded so much if he had said at the start "sorry lads im going off with Lisa i'll see you later" but the fact that he asked us first then did a 180 as soon as the chance to poke the toalie-hole was offered up was just wide. Thats the kind of shit that really gets my goat, so to speak. FUCKING HELL. Ended up back at Darrens where we had a few beers, even phoned dial a drink but they were taking AGES and as i left at around 4 they still hadnt showed, compliants will be lodged, then watched some predictable teen comedy fluff before heading home. Plans being changed do not sit well!!! Especially when they turn out pure shite as tonights did. So ill end my little diatribe of Downey with a quote from sir Winston Churchill: "GROW SOME BALLS MY MAN!" Must dash, ta-ra.

      An unexpected end to the day indeed. As you can see im not writing this at my usual 12:30 in the morning time. This is because I only got in a half hour ago for reasons i shall divulge to you all....now. The day started off pure shite as always, and i was desperately searching for anything at all to do to fill my time until i was tired enough to go to bed. I ended up just watching some pish on the Greek myths and playing the guitar for a wee bit. A phonecall from one Danny Bombscare soon changed my fortune. "Fancy coming up to mine for a wee drink or something?" and of course the answer was yes. A "wee drink or something" was not all we had however. We soon ran out of beer coz we are cheap and had minimum supplies, so Danny had the first-class idea of phoning up Gay Burn to see if he wanted to join in the fun with some of his famous Morrocan herbs. And, legend that the Gay is, true to his word he showed up and not only supplied us with some fucking mental hash but also taught us how to roll as well for nowt!! No denerio was needed, what a guy, hats off to the man. Me and Coongay ended up staggering from Dannys house in Mossend to the petrol station in Bellshill at half four in the morning looking for some juice and crisps, singing many Libertines songs on the empty streets of Bellshill. We were pretty monged. It's weird to think that about 7 hours earlier i had fuck all to do that night and was pleading with the clock to turn quicker so that i could retire after yet another day of routine boredom. I don't normally like it when things take a turn into the unknown, when things dont go the way theyre planned i tend to panic and worry a bit, especially around virtual strangers, I mean i dont even know Burn but he turned out to be bang on and I much prefer the way the night turned out. We were supposed to be going out somewhere tonight as well, originally we were meant to go to Dannys again coz his parents werent going to be in but it turns out they are, so then we were going to go out to a pub in Mossend but after last night it looks doubtful, im well tired (got about 3 and a half hours sleep on dannys wee brothers bed) and i still have to brave work tonight, i'll die if i have as much to do as i have had in recent evenings, shite job. So this is a testimonial to Mr Gary Burn, Bearded Bringer Of The Hashish. I salute you...and your beard.

      Yes it's true, my old routine of saying that im going to do piss poor in an exam only to get a decent mark has come to pass once again. My results were alright it must be said, especially seeing as the amount of time and effort i out in this year.  Adv English C, Modies A (gasps!), Info Systems B and Psychology B (yet more, louder gasps, almost could be described as a guffaw). Quite chuffed, it seems that most people this year did 'ok' in their exams, except Cooney who as always bends the exams over and gives them it royally from the rear.  Some people narrowly missed out on what they needed but will still get into Uni through clearences, so its all good really, the posse will not be beaten just yet! So the last thing tying me to high school is over and im now completely done and my days as a Newman Punter have ceased to be. Ahh tis a sorrowful day indeed, i didnt enjoy being at school by no means (well the final year anyway, previous years were ok, 4th was alright etc) but i dont adapt well to change and this is one of the biggest iv faced, the move from high school to university, it wont be pretty i tell you.  Ive also made a drastic decision as regards my dilemma of whether or not to go for that job interview: no suprises here when you learn that i pussied out of it as always. But i had solid reasons for not going for this job, as it will most likey interfere with Uni more than i would be able to handle and the job itself is mince, not my cup of Lapsang Souchong.  So Scotmid it is then, but i really do need a new job soon, i hate that place, its fucking pish and several of my co-workers (and customers, oh the dreaded customers) are little shits or else just annoy me by being themselves (ie wankers). I'll just look for something a little closer to home and a little more applicable to my shakey list of attributes.  Good luck finding that right? Bye then.

      The final thing connecting me to a very stressful final year at high school comes to an end tomorrow as my exam results for 6th year saunter their way to my abode, and although i dont really need these results for any reason other than personal well-being, being a pretentious and greedy bastard i want to do well, so im brickin it a peach.  It only hit me last week that i still had results to get but im not as nervous as i was this time last year, where i was in the foetal position round about now.  Most people know that ive had a bit of a shite year for one reason or another and during that time exams were not really high on my list of troubles, so i took a much more lackadaisical attidude to my studies than in years gone by.  As a result i dont imagine i've done as well as in previous years, so i'll give you my predictions: Advanced English C or Fail, Modies B or C, Info Systems C or Fail, Psychology Fail.  Although id love to do well its not really important and i dont claim to be as in bad shape as some of my comrades whose entire futures will be decided in just a few hours, so i'll shut up now as a mark of respect.  I will however wish said comrades the best of luck as it reaches the zero hour.  So, on with more pressing matters... why is it that parents these days bequeath upon their children ever more outlandish names. There is simply nothing more hilarious than a beast of a woman with tattoos and a thick Scottish accent yelling at the top of her huge lung capacity the name 'NIKITA!!!' or 'AINSLIE!!!'. Genius! Do they think it will make their offspring more sophisticated? Do they really think the names are pretty or that it gives the child class in some way? I would go back to school if i could just to make fun of the new breed of amusingly monikered youth. Good times would be had. Anyway,  another entry will follow tomorrow to tell of how i fared in my exams. Cheerio.

      Hello. Before my intended little rabble i'll try to settle a debate. The site  urlLink www.bigbetty.tk  was supposed to jst be a bunch of ppl talking utter pish about nothing in particular in an attempt to have a bit of a laugh, it has since turned into downey and darren abusing celtic and rangers respectively. This will not do, whats the point? There is now a 'im not contributing until its neutral' debate so i say why not make it neutral and have NO football on it to save all the shite.   Right, now thats over with, on with the pish for which this site was intended... Downey suggested that i get my own page so i can talk about music but i dont fancy it really, anything iv got to say about anything i'll put on here, including music, which i will do now.  Last nite i got my computer to finally do something productive and download a full live concert by the Libertines (find this at  urlLink www.babyshambles.com/pissed  ).  The concert is amazing and the band are incredible, if you have not heard this band do so now, you'll either love it or hate it but if you are part of the former group it will change your life.  If I was to get a tattoo (which ssems quite tempting these days) i'd get the word 'Libertine' on my arm, much the same as the one Carl from said group has emblazoned on his bicep.  The Libertines mean freedom, love, an escape from the mundane lives we lead and tell you its alright to be whatever you want so long as ur happy, and whats wrong with that??? However theres trouble aboard the good ship Albion, as singer Pete Doherty has become a drug riddled fool and has been told not to contact the rest of the band till hes kicked his habit, which it seems he is unable to do.  So the Libertines may not exist for much longer, which is a right bitch cause they are genius.  The Libertines have a fan base unlike any other because they actually make an effort to get close with them, they play gigs in fans living rooms and invite fans back to theirs for a bit of a singsong and a few giggles. Can you see Kylie doing that? Craig David having a knees up with his fan? It wouldnt happen which is why Libertines fans are solid and want Pete to get better so he can join his friends and do a gig in my house!!! The band once played a gig in a pub for free because a fan asked them too, and then Pete asked if he could stay in the place coz he didnt have a hotel for that night. AMAZING! Anyway, heed these words, the Libertines are the future (if they stay together that long), ive seen it. Download some tracks (notably What A Waster, Time For Heroes, Up the Bracket, Tell the King, or anything else it doesnt matter Dont Look Back Into the Sun is another) The new self titled album is released August 30th and their debut is out now, get it, you shall not be disappointed, and you'll never be the same again!

      I had already started typing one of my famous and exceedingly witty little diatribe on the awfulness of life, however my computer is currently running the Intel Pentium 4000BC processor, ergo it's testes, and i got cut off. So i shall waffle on about an unrelated issue, my current dilemma: whether or not to go for an interview for a new job. I have been invited to an interview at some call centre hingymajig in airdre and the question is to go or not. Points for: i loathe my current employ, better money, easier work, i think i might as well go seeing as i already have an interview in keeping with my 'try everything, and if you dont die, you win' dictum, etc. Points against: its far away (airdre is 3 buses from my house), might not be viable when i go to uni as the hours are gammy, scary interview where i have to do 'role playing' (shudders), it involes an early rise on saturdays (shudders). So i am at a loss. I know not what to do. Should i go for a beast of an interview for a job which i really wont like or be good at as it involves telephones which im told i am not a master of as i dont talk, or should i stay in a job which i hate because its the most menial soul sucking crap in the world, ever. Decisions, decisions. I might hold out and see if i can get a job in a place i would like, such as HMV or a bookshop or Global Video or something which i know a lot about. I dont know. I also have to decide whether or not to get driving lessons for my 18th which im unsure about coz i cant afford a car once i pass or insurance, which thus renders driving lessons a pointless excercise. Ive now realised that i analyse things way too much and i should stop thinking and have more beer to dumb down my thoughts and make me think of less complicated matters such as bluebells and cockleshells and pretty maids all in a row. Bye now.

      Bad news kids, the third summer of love could be coming to an abrupt halt. Just as i start getting into, shall we say, alternative forms of stimulation, the pesky folks in parliament start changing the law so that its now either illegal or else just more difficult to get hold of (the law is vague). I remember it well when it was realised that so long as you didnt prepare magic mushrooms in anyway, they were perfectly legal and you could shovel fields of the stuff into your gob without any legal repercussions, only psychological ones, whereby the cows start dancing and the hills really do come alive with the sound of music. It appears that, just as with cannabis, the government dont want our youth doing any kind of drugs which they dont make somesort of profit on (VAT), leaving only cigarettes and alcohol for us kids to consume. So, after just one highly enjoyable halucinogenic experience, my experiments with the humble psilocybe may be brought to a premature close. So if im not going to get any sort of legal high, might as well start smoking crack then eh?

      Dont have anything to say the now, nor will i ever but anyhoo, im just trying to get the grips with the technical difficulies of all this new fangled contraption, it'll never catch on i tell you. Hopefully soon you'll be able to take a peek inside the exciting, freaky and often boring as fuck mind of one young chappie from a place you never want to visit and never will, tune in later for some accounts of what i do with my days in tht in-between phase where im not in school and not in uni yet, spending countless hours watching utter shite on the tv, talking utter shite on msn and thinking strange thoughts of a various nature including, but not limited to: squirrels and other woodland creatures, bewinged harbingers of doom and a 5o foot plutonium bum. Ciao.
