      The obvious point is that it’s nearly impossible to focus solely on the aesthetic elements of a work, since a context always exists (even if that context is your own experience). (I say "obvious" partially because I’ve been making this point for the last five years, but most evaluative criticism also seems to bear it out.) But I’m less sure about what to do about that: do you try to focus on the aesthetic elements, anyway, or do you embrace the context? With the former, my concern is that you’d lose sight of whatever extra-textual stuff might significantly deepen the experience (e.g., watching  Far From Heaven  as any other drama, without thinking about the imitative aspect of the film). With the latter, the risk is ignoring the aesthetic properties of the object altogether while critiquing the artist, the hype, the cultural phenomenon, etc.  Or, maybe more of what I’m getting at, you start conflating aesthetic and non-aesthetic properties. "The smooth saxophone solo is bad because smooth jazz is a soulless genre for soccer moms." "Interpol is bad because they sound too much like Joy Division." The demographics of music consumption and the historical precedents for bands’ styles are certainly interesting, but can they validly support a value judgment?

      1.  How similar is O’Rourke’s attitude on  Eureka  to Todd Haynes’ in  Far   From Heaven ?  2.  Was Nick Drake able to get away with a smooth saxophone solo on "The Chime of a City Clock" because there was no smooth-jazz radio to negatively associate it with in 1969? How does our inevitable familiarity with smooth-jazz radio affect our current response? Would Drake not have done the solo today?

      After mulling it over, here’s my basic thought re: the negative connotation of smooth saxophone solos. It’s because they go against two common values in rock discourse: a) unpretentiousness and b) authenticity. The saxophone solo is read as pretentious partially to the extent that all rock solos can be self-indulgent -- but perhaps even more so in that the sax is seen as the instrument of the hipster jazz-cat, and the solo as a pandering attempt to give the song some "jazz cred." This might still be okay if it were Charlie Parker hopped up on skag, blowing the fuck out of his horn to exorcise his demons: that’s art. But the  smooth  saxophone sound is purposefully polished, slick, and often anonymous, and thus it’s also coded as inauthentic. After the 1980s, it’s especially difficult to hear a smooth saxophone solo in any context without immediately associating it with Smooth Jazz, a genre derided for corrupting the vitality of jazz and turning it into background music for upscale cafes and corporate cubicles.        Jim O’Rourke knowingly plays with these associations in his song "Through the Night Softly" (from  Eureka ), which features an out-of-nowhere smooth saxophone solo courtesy Ken Vandermark. O’Rourke  urlLink admits  that the solo, which actually resembles the ending credits theme to  Saturday Night Live,  is supposed to sound corny: "That’s 100 percent what I was going for. I remember recording it and saying "No, Ken, stupider… stupider. " What’s really intriguing about it, though, is that even though O’Rourke is intellectually interested in the genre appropriation as cultural signifier, he also claims to genuinely enjoy the solo. Not only does it work musically within the song, he says, but he was attracted to it because he "like[s] stupid stuff." One reason I appreciate O’Rourke’s records so much is because they understand that "cheesy" and "enjoyable" are not contradictory. (The first time I heard  Eureka,  O’Rourke’s cover of "Something Big," by Burt Bacharach, actually made me laugh out loud. It was so ridiculous and so good all at once.)  Because he’s also done serious avant-garde records and plays with Sonic Youth (the epitome of NYC cool), O’Rourke can put out a song like "Through the Night Softly," with its "stupid" solo, and not risk instant dismissal. But if it sounds so much like G.E. Smith, why can’t we then appreciate G.E. Smith? Since when are artistic self-awareness and "indie cred" valid aesthetic criteria?

      I’m thinking about how certain aesthetic elements have become, for some people, automatic signifiers of badness. For example, I’ve always thought of my fondness for Steely Dan as a guilty pleasure insofar as there’s a common perception (among my peers) of the band as "cheesy." So I was pleased that there was so much  urlLink Steely Dan love  on ILM a few weeks back. And yet some participants also couldn’t quite defend certain elements of the band’s sound, especially on  Gaucho.  One person fretted about having "to readjust [his] aesthetic values [to] accommodate that sort of lite-jazz rhythm section," admitting that he can’t ordinarily say anything interesting about "this sort of music." For me, it’s not so much the rhythm section as the general glossy production and, perhaps most obviously, the smooth saxophone solos. But that’s what I mean: a smooth saxophone solo is frequently thought of as an irredeemable feature in a song, and so why is that exactly? What makes that particular sound bad? Or is it more of a contextual issue than we’d like to think – i.e., do we say it’s the sax when we mean something else?

      This actually may be all I have to say for now (I didn't mean to get so carried away!):  ...Lap-pop, on the other hand, approaches song composition from a fundamentally electronic perspective. Meaning that even when organic elements like guitars are central to the mix, they are treated no differently from the computer-generated pops and clicks. Each sound is a discrete texture -- the composer’s job is to arrange the textures in such a way where they can all breathe. This, in a nutshell, is IDM: Squarepusher playing around with jazz guitar on messy, breakbeat-riddled tracks; Aphex Twin prettying it up with pizzicato strings. Where lap-pop goes IDM one further is in taking one of these typical sonic landscapes, finding a hook, smoothing out the edges, and opening itself up for a pop vocal line. Hence, “vocal IDM.” But sometimes so pop it’s more like New Wave with better technology: if there were gently skittering beats in 1982, wouldn’t Spandau Ballet have used them?

      Obviously, I'm going to use this site to write about music occasionally, especially if ILM continues to inspire thoughts. Lately, what I've been getting excited about, as a listener, is the trend variously referred to as  urlLink "lap-pop"  or "vocal IDM." It’s clear that an impulse to wed vocals with electronics is in the air, as evidenced by all the hype that electroclash has been getting. But I haven’t been too keen on electroclash, based on my limited experiences with Le Tigre, Tracy + the Plastics, and Fischerspooner. I think it’s because a) the programmed percussion is very cold, all smacks and slaps, and b) the vocals tend to be too shouty and monotone for my tastes. (This is why I prefer Fischerspooner’s "The 15th"  to "Emerge" – it sounds more like New Order.) Whereas lap-pop – which I’m going to define through The Notwist, The Postal Service, and Schneider TM – is more often warmer, or at least less emotionally distant. Right now, I’m listening to Schneider TM’s "Reality Check"  and realizing that the vocal line isn’t all that interesting – and yet it’s underpinned by this gorgeous acoustic guitar figure, swirling synths, and skittering (but subtle) beats. And the voice itself is given a vocoder treatment so there’s automatically more harmony and richness.   But I also want to define this sound against ordinary pop or rock songs that use samples or other electronic flourishes. Like, a few years ago (circa 1997-98), a lot of rock acts took hints from the sudden worldwide popularity of The Chemical Brothers and Fatboy Slim, and released their "techno albums" (U2’s  Pop,  Smashing Pumpkins’  Adore,  even Bowie’s  Earthling ). That was sort of exciting at first, just to see where it would all lead, what it meant for the "death of rock" and all that. (Obviously, it led nowhere: the Pumpkins inched toward irrelevancy and broke up; the failure of  Pop  paved the way for U2’s celebrated return to earnest, no-frills rock on  All That You Can’t Leave Behind. ) But too often the marriage of guitars and techno beats felt forced, and the common complaint was that the electronics created a sense of detachment; they robbed the music of any emotion or human connection.   In fact, in a lot of people’s eyes, electronic beats and textures are  always  aesthetic signifiers of detached emotion. Leave it to  urlLink Bjork  to point out the fallacy of that argument: "People keep telling me that technology is cold, that computers are the death of feeling in music and that it's only music if it has guitars or violins," she says.  "But how can you blame a computer for that?  Who is supposed to put the soul in the music?   I mean, you don't look at a guitar and expect it to jump up and write a tune for you. A computer is just a tool.  Every decision is made by the artist using that tool." The problem, I think, becomes when you graft electronics onto an already structured song, as so many rock bands have done. With so little room to affect the basic landscape of the song, the electronic component comes across as a signifier of style (sexy! cold!) rather than a palette from which to build something new.   Next: Lap-pop and New Wave.

      Hey, so first post. This blog is something I've been meaning to do for a while now, but two things have sort of gotten the ball rolling: 1) I recently read some of my writing in public, which made me realize that the contents of my journal, the poems and mini-essays and all that, don't actually have to languish privately just because they're kinda messy or brief or whatever -- people still like it! 2) I've been posting to ILX regularly now, which has a) increased my belief in the value of web-publishing in general, and b) made me more comfortable with the whole blog format for my own writing. I'm hoping to post some of what I've written there on this site, and vice versa.   Here goes nothin'!

      I’ve been working on a mini-essay about popular music’s lack of academic institutionalization, but I’ve had a hard time getting a handle on it. I think the topic is probably bigger than I’d like to make it.   My thesis so far: Popular music is not treated as a substantive field of study (i.e., beyond pop-culture studies) because a) unlike novelists and visual artists, who study the history of their discipline as a matter of course, popular musicians are not seen as "intellectuals" participating in an unique discourse; b) while the notion of the auteur (still a contentious issue) allowed the academy to see film studies at its inception as analogous to existing studies of artists and writers, it is perhaps even less applicable to popular music; c) there is a relative absence of legitimizing institutions (like the gallery complex) or gatekeepers (respected novelist-critics) to isolate significant works for study; d) compared to literary and artistic "themes," the focus of much academic inquiry, it is not always obvious what popular music is "about" (it is often more functional); and e) while the lines between popular and high-culture art and literature are quite blurry (cf. the  urlLink Jonathan Franzen debacle ), thus giving more leeway for popular works to sneak into syllabi, they are much more stark with respect to music (composition or bust).  I realize some of these causes may actually be symptoms, which is what makes the whole subject so difficult. As a sideline, I also want to discuss how libraries give popular music the short shrift. (One nice thing I did discover in my research to date: one of my favorite academics, Michael Berube, has started a  urlLink blog .)

      Last night, I was reading some blogs from ILM folks (mostly  urlLink this ), and whaddaya know, came across Michael Daddino's  urlLink review  of  Elevator Music.

       Just mention the words  Muzak, easy-listening,  or even  contemporary instrumental,  and many critics will lash out with judgments such as “boring,” “dehumanized,” “vapid,” “cheesy,” and (insult of insults) “elevator music.” But such reactions appear to be based more on cultural prejudice than honest musical appraisal. ... After decades of rock, rhythm and blues, folk, heavy metal, and rap, a desensitived population seems to assume that if music is not hot, heavy, bubbling with jackhammer rhythms and steaming with emotion or anger, it is somehow less than good or (worse) less than art.   				                                                          -- Joseph Lanza,  Elevator Music  (1994)  Predictably, I’m sympathetic to Lanza’s project: to rescue easy-listening from the “categorical pejorative” it’s become. (That’s partly out of a willingness to take any genre seriously, but also because I do like a lot of the music discussed -- Les Baxter, for instance.) But I guess I’d like the book to actually investigate those cultural prejudices rather than simply persuading the reader that the music is valuable despite them.   As Lanza relates the history of elevator music, there’s one idea he treats with some significance -- that what set this music apart from the dominant genres of the early twentieth century (both classical and jazz) was the lack of listening attention it required. Full attention, in fact, was practically discouraged: this was music made to dine to, work to, make love to. Lanza goes out of his way to articulate the heavenly beauty of music meant specifically to be unobtrusive, rhapsodizing about the harmonious harps and swelling strings. And if other critics have failed to notice the sweetness of this sound, perhaps it’s because they can’t take it on these terms: the very nature of the critical enterprise demands an attention this music wasn’t made for.   But in taking on a more functional role, elevator music was also more obviously designed, or manufactured, than other music of its day. What Lanza doesn’t adequately explore is the ways in which easy-listening signifies not just blandness but inauthenticity. In other words, the emotions are not just neutral, they're fake. Only after re-reading the excerpt above did I realize “folk” is included, oddly, in a list of genres described as “hot, heavy, [and] bubbling with jackhammer rhythms.” If contemporary critics can abide folk music and not easy-listening (though both are subdued), it’s because the former is seen as genuine, individualistic artistic expression among critics who still place a high value on “authenticity.”   I’m also interested in how the principles of elevator music, such as the emphasis on mood and environment, play out in music not necessarily related to the middlebrow lounge and soundtrack records Lanza spotlights. For instance: the Beach Boys, who aren’t even mentioned. There is an Eno section (which I haven’t read yet), but it doesn’t seem like contemporary electronic sounds are considered in any depth. I’d also (naturally) be curious to see a discussion of contemporary acts that plumb easy-listening styles, such as Stereolab, the High Llamas, or even Tortoise. How does the music change when it’s mixed with more propulsive rhythms or glitchy sound effects?

      Mother’s Day 2003 Mix CD:   Beach Boys, “Our Prayer”	 The Beatles, “Martha My Dear”	 The Kinks, “Afternoon Tea”			 Beach Boys, “Little Bird”				 Neil Young, “I Am a Child”				 Nick Drake, “Cello Song”				 Pullman, “Two Parts Water”				 Rachel's, “Kentucky Nocturne”		 Wilco, “Jesus, Etc.”					 Yo La Tengo, “Tears Are in Your Eyes”			 Iron and Wine, “Bird Stealing Bread”			 Kings of Convenience, “Leaning Against the Wall”	 Antonio Carlos Jobim, “Triste”				 Maxwell, “Seguranca”			 Chet Baker, “But Not For Me”			 Ella Fitzgerald, “Azure”				 Joni Mitchell, “River”  So there are basically three sections: Oldies, Newer Acoustic, and Jazz, with segues that I think work pretty well. It struck me, though, that most of the mix has a melancholy vibe -- which wasn’t the intention, necessarily, but probably the result of the fact that the music I find the most “pleasant” (my general criterion here) also tends to be sort of sad. Stark and simple is okay, but stark, simple, and sorrowful can be gorgeous to me. So she’s limited by this bias of mine: oh well.   (When I gave my mom the CD, she seemed to get the most excited about the Ella Fitzgerald song, saying she’s been on a vocal-jazz kick lately. But I’ve yet to hear any thoughts since she’s actually heard it.)

      Two potential pitfalls Lukas Moodysson neatly avoids in  Lilya 4-Ever :   1. Wallowing in Lilya’s misery. This is a girl whose family abandons her in cold, poverty-stricken Russia and who is eventually raped and exploited as a prostitute. And yet rarely do we ever feel like the film is a recitation of suffering, one misery after the other to prove that Life Sucks. I’m sympathetic to Jonathan Rosenbaum’s frustration with films that offer  urlLink sadism posing as humanism , but I don’t think that this film should be put in that camp. While the first fifteen minutes seem to tug in that direction (Mom leaves! Mud on the dress! Aunt is a bitch! New flat is decrepit!), it’s worth noting that none of the later sexual violence is dwelt upon. It just happens, confusingly. And Lilya’s friendship with Volodya  is ultimately about love and hope.   2. Exploitation. Larry Clark defends the nudity in  Bully  as being true to these kids’ lives. If we are shocked, then all the better: we’ve faced the disturbing reality of American teenage sexuality. But I’ve yet to see a compelling justification for the camera shots that intrude and linger upon the girls’ crotches. Not only does  Lilya 4-Ever  avoid this kind of overt salaciousness, it refuses to sexualize Lilya at all. In none of the handful of sex scenes do we ever see more than her face, which usually tells us all we need to know. (An unsettling montage late in the film is shown entirely from Lilya’s POV: all sweaty men mechanically heaving above her.) You don’t have to be a radical feminist to appreciate how this affects our view of the character. With no place for us to take even a small delight in Lilya’s body, as an object, we remain strictly with her, as a person. And we are with her all the way.

      Top five songs right now (in alphabetical order):   1. Iron and Wine, “Bird Stealing Bread” 2. Stephen Malkmus and The Jicks, "Dynamic Calories" 3. Snoop Dogg, "Beautiful" 4. Steely Dan, "My Old School" 5. Justin Timberlake, “Rock Your Body”  I'm conscious, of course, that  urlLink these kinds of lists  are often designed to show off their maker’s eclecticism, and that my list could be used as a case in point. But fuck it -- all those songs are great. The Malkmus song, which comes from an EP packaged with  Pig Lib,  is better than anything actually on the album: it sounds like early Sea and Cake. And I’m enjoying “My Old School” as a new-ish Steely Dan song. (When I dubbed  A Decade of Steely Dan  onto cassette eight years ago, that was one of the songs I had to cut for space. So the other day, when I heard it on the radio, it sounded fresh and great, with thoughts of Nicolas and Joel when they mention “Annandale.” Luckily, I just borrowed my dad’s CD of  Decade,  so I’ve been able to replay it.)   “Bird Stealing Bread,” one of the few songs to have made me cry, is on my mind because I’m putting it on a mix CD for my mom for Mother’s Day. I’ll post the full tracklisting when I’m done, but it’s been an interesting challenge. Some songs are easy to guess she’ll like (Beatles, Jobim), while others I can’t tell at all. For whatever reason, I’m feeling super-sensitive about vocals: it’s suddenly striking me that singers like Georgia Hubley and Stuart Murdoch, who I’ve never minded, don’t have the greatest voices. But what should I do? I’m dead set on getting this 53-year-old hospital administrator into indie pop!

      I saw  Night of the Hunter  this week. This may be an absurd comparison (it no longer sits with me as well as it did the other day), but the film initially reminded me of Terrence Malick’s films from the 1970’s:  1. Similarities between Harry Powell (Robert Mitchum) and Kit Carruthers (Martin Sheen in  Badlands ): Both are charismatic, cocksure, but ultimately lonely criminals in the 1950’s who ingratiate themselves to others through the sheer popularity of their personae: Powell as a righteous preacher and Kit as a James Dean figure. Most interestingly, neither character is presented psychologically; there is no attempt to fill out their back-stories or delve into their motivations. I find this particularly notable in the 1955  Night of the Hunter,  since even Hitchcock, five years later, felt it necessary to explain away Norman Bates at the end of  Psycho.  We leave  Hunter  still asking, "Is he truly deranged, or is it all an elaborate act? Or both?"   2. Children as figures of audience identification: Malick’s 1970’s films are both narrated by adolescents – Sissy Spacek in  Badlands  and Linda Manz in  Days of Heaven  – and so we see the world principally through their eyes. In  Night of the Hunter,  we empathize most strongly with nine-year-old John Harper (Billy Chapin), as he’s the only one who’s consistently suspicious of the villainous Powell. The use of children has a similar effect, I think, of flattening the film’s perspective. The kids aren’t wise or confident enough to provide insight – Holly’s narration in  Badlands  is coolly objective; John is mostly silent (even in the company of his friendly uncle) and fairly single-minded in his stubbornness toward Powell (he just wants to keep a promise to his father). And so if these are the only characters with whom we can affiliate ourselves, there’s something unsettling about the strangeness or complexity of the events simply not being remarked upon.    3. Nature imagery: As soon as John and Pearl run away,  Night of the Hunter  becomes littered with close-ups of animals – frogs, owls, and rabbits along the river banks; cows in a barn where the children take shelter. Malick similarly lingers on  urlLink shots of animals  throughout  Badlands  and  Days of Heaven.  And yet in this case, the cinematic function clearly differs. For Malick, the wealth of attention paid to grasshoppers, grazing deer, etc., in  Heaven  is all in the name of naturalism, both literally and figuratively. That is, he minimizes the structured human drama (the love triangle) in favor of the bigger, transcendental, natural world outside (those huge Midwestern skies). But  Night of the Hunter  operates in a much more theatrical, expressionist style. There is nothing outside the world of the narrative: the animals, like the sky full of stars, seem to exist solely to watch over the children. Whereas Malick uses nature to direct our attention away from the plot, Charles Laughton uses it to deepen the plot’s significance. Here, it’s part of the set design.

      I’ve been writing about music a lot lately, so I wanted to reprint this e-mail I wrote BT back in March about  All the Real Girls,  one of my favorite films of 2003 so far:   "On one hand, I found  All the Real Girls  to be somewhat uneven. The older characters -- Leland and Elvira -- seem underdeveloped, more like sketches. And though I appreciate Green's impulse toward a loose, documentary style of filmmaking, I think his films could benefit from more judicious editing. There's an early scene with Feng-Shui on Leland's shoulders as they walk silently through a field -- the cut to the scene is oddly abrupt, and the camera lingers on them for way too long. These moments add up.   On the other hand, the movie had a profound impact on me, like almost nothing else I've seen. I dwelled on it all last week, writing about it several times in my journal, and coming to new understandings each time. And I saw it again the other day. I'm still thinking about it.   I think it affected me so strongly because it worked on two levels. As a movie fan, I absolutely love anything that's naturalistic and episodic. I smiled at scenes like the conversation between Noel and Bust-Ass about food expanding in the stomach -- it's such a goofy dialogue, but so right on with its small-talk awkwardness. And, as Green says, moments like these are nothing that a "witty screenwriter" could've come up with, or else it'd feel contrived. (He says this, in  NewCity,  about Noel whispering "hellohellohello" in Paul's ear -- Zooey did it spontaneously.)   So I can champion the film in a "more movies like this, please!" way. But it also emotionally devastated me, which I think has to do with the psychological complexity of the characters. You can see how genuinely Paul and Noel love each other, how well they get along -- but they are in totally different places in their lives, and they can't understand how significantly that affects their relationship. The tragedy of their story is that they  are  the "best boy and girl for each other" at that moment, and that they do still have feelings for each other, despite everything that happens.   Where these two levels come together is in remarkable scenes like the motel room -- from the tension-diffusing pillow fight to Noel's soul-baring story about her scar. If that's not among the most remarkable performances I've seen from an actress, I don't know what is -- in ten minutes, she goes from nervousness (about being there) to playfulness (the pillow fight) to pain (the scar story) and then joyful love (at being able to share it with Paul). She cries and laughs at the same time. She expresses volumes with just the way her mouth moves. She says lines like, "Tip doesn't even know about this" in an off-handed way, as if she just thought to bring it up.   Now, I'll admit to finding parts of the film uniquely resonant because a) their relationship bears similarities to relationships I've had, and so certain scenes were more poignant than they otherwise might be, and b) Noel is totally my kinda gal (particularly since Zooey is so beautiful), and so I felt like I loved her, too. In other words, there's surely a subjective component to my feelings about the movie. Just so you know. But I can defend it all, too.   As for the [meaning of the] title, I think I've cheated by having read almost every single interview or article about David Gordon Green available online in the last week. Although I guess the only comment I found from Green himself was that it originated as the title of a song that a friend of his wrote -- he didn't say any more than that. The suggestion I actually like best -- I don't remember where I read it -- is that it's a dedication: (To) All the Real Girls. Especially when you consider that Green and Schneider co-wrote this film, inspired by their own past relationships and aiming to present a "real" image of young love for once. To all the real girls who inspired this movie."

       Based strictly on its packaging, Radiohead’s  Hail to the Thief  is a much more logocentric album than its two predecessors. (I haven’t seen the packaging for anything before  Kid A. ) Not only are the lyrics printed inside, but the artwork is a painted map of Manhattan covered, magnetic-poetry style, in "evocative" words and phrases (many of which surface in the lyrics).   I do like that this use of words seems to point up the chaos and indeterminacy of language: the map is a jumble; all of the songs have alternate titles. I especially like the double-meaning of "There There"  (the record’s first single and possibly best song), which I’d never before considered. On one hand, it’s a phrase spoken to sooth someone; on the other hand, when it shows up on the map, as a "place," it’s hard not to think of the famous Gertrude Stein quote about Oakland.  In the first case, the words "there there" are nonsensical; in the second, they’re paradoxical. Ah, language.  And yet I don’t like how Radiohead has invited this attention to words and politics. (What the words on the map evoke, mostly, are things like globalization and post-9/11 attitudes.) Because it’s precisely this kind of thing that seduces critics into praising bands as Important Artists without having to reflect much on the actual experience of listening to them.   Radiohead’s music is surely interesting enough to be taken on its own terms, whether it’s to explore their usage of  urlLink pivot tones  or even to demonstrate that their sound is  urlLink not as progressive  as contemporary hip-hop. For what it’s worth, I disagree with Sasha Frere-Jones’ claim that there’s   urlLink "little … trace of punk, hip-hop, or beat-oriented club music"  in Radiohead’s sound (In "Where I End and You Begin,"  from  Hail to the Thief,  I hear both Depeche Mode and Gang of Four.) But I admire his desire to unpack "what people like when they like Radiohead," since for many I think it does have to do with silly ideas about Thom Yorke’s tortured genius persona, the band’s mystical politics (borrowed from  Adbusters ), and the very  fact  of their Warp influence (rather than how it’s put into practice).   In short, there’s a place for the kind of analysis I performed in those first two paragraphs – but sometimes it seems too easy (words being naturally easier to write about than music), and the temptation to go that route is often at the expense of interesting phenomenological criticism.

      The Pinefox  urlLink responds  to my post from 5/30 (scroll down). Even though I'm currently reading Simon Frith's interesting  Performing Rites: On the Value of Popular Music,  I'm no longer sure I want to write about this whole topic. At least not now.

      My Top 5 Musical Moments (May 2003):  1. High as a kite at a party, and 2pac’s "California Love" came on the stereo. The only context I’d ever heard this song was in a remix of Beck’s "Where It’s At," and I didn’t even know where the sample came from. (I desperately need to school myself on post-1993 hip-hop and dance.) Dancing wildly to the original song, I was amazed at how prominent that vocoder is – it’s the whole chorus. I shouted, "I love it! How come more people don’t use the vocoder?!" And then I did the robot, and then some dandy swagger, and then just jumped up and down to the endless beats.  2. In Michigan, on a sunny, windy afternoon, Matt introduced me to Life Without Buildings. "Wait, why did you think I would like it again?" I said. "It’s sorta like Pavement, and it’s sorta like the Sugarcubes, and…" Oh yeah! The guitars get on a frenetic groove, driving but swerving and falling down stairs, forming sevenths, like Sleater-Kinney at their best ("Get Up"). And Sue Tompkins shouts girl-like, repetitious, like a sugar rush. I was air-drumming immediately and begging others to hear. This was post-punk but fun!    3. Adrian Crowley at the Empty Bottle, May 17: In between two women, a skinny rock-chick bass player and a plain, long-haired cellist, this Irishman picked up his electric guitar and just strummed and sang. I don’t always know when simple repetition will work for me: last night, a Smog song I wanted to like sounded tedious. But I think it has to do with tension: what I loved about Crowley was the way those basic chords, played fast and amplified, surrounded by low end, became a hypnotic blur that fell in and out of noise.   4. "Magic Stick," Lil’ Kim feat. 50 Cent. My favorite new radio single. The best part is the unexpected melody of that second descending "ma-a-gic (uh-huh, uh-huh)" in the chorus. Until that point, there’s only four notes, highlighted by a single minor triad: "I can hit once / I can hit twice" ascends the chord; "magic stick" and "baddest chick" descend it. But the second "ma-a-gic" pivots on the middle note and drops down to form a major triad – and with such sparse instrumentation, it’s unsettling: 50 Cent as a zombie. What? What?    5. The North Atlantic at the Prodigal Son, May 31: The show was disappointing insofar as they only played five songs (the bar’s fault), and I still haven’t cottoned to their new, more hardcore sound. But I was pleased because a) those boys move around on stage like nobody else (Jason R. seeming to straddle his bass, Jason H. in an absolute frenzy); b) Jason H. wants to revive Pico de Ohio (our ambient-folk duo) when he moves to Chicago; and c) we all went back to Mark’s place after the show and listened to the amazing  Hail to the Thief  bootleg. And so I felt happy about the future of music.

      One of the nice things about listening to pop music more regularly is that I’ve been able to develop more of a critical faculty for it, instead of dismissing it all out of hand or only liking it ironically. An example:  For Squeezed, I made a mix CD of songs from last summer, to play in between performers. I had some indie stuff, obviously, but I also wanted to include more pop radio hits, to make it more zeitgeisty for the crowd. So, with the help of Brooke D. and Matt P. and Ryan R., I was able to mash together some hip-hop, modern rock, and dance-pop, and though I’m still annoyed that I couldn’t find anyone who had Nelly’s “Hot in Herre” (the defining single of last summer!), I like how the CD turned out. (Full track listing below.)   The song I probably like the least is Pink’s “Just Like a Pill”: the verse is muddled and unmemorable, and the chorus is anthemic in a pretty tired way (Before “you’re just like a pill,” she sings this pick-up, “and I swear,” with the exact same notes as Medley/Warnes use for that phrase in “(I’ve Had) The Time of My Life” and All-4-One uses in “I Swear.”) But while listening to all of  Missundaztood,  I realized that her previous single, “Let’s Get This Party Started,” is sleek and sexy and a lot more fun. In the past, I might’ve heard “Just Like a Pill” and thought, “Typical bland radio shit.” But in context now, I think: “Not one of her better singles; maybe she should stick to a dancier style.”  Or, last summer, I jumped on the Jimmy-Eat-World-are-sellouts bandwagon out of some stupid  urlLink indie instinct.  I hadn’t even really heard the band much, apart from one night in Kalamazoo a few years ago, when Chris S. blared them from  urlLink Mike D.’s  truck, and I wasn’t even into emo then, so they barely made an impression. But now they were all over Q101, and they sounded so slick and produced, it made me unable to take them seriously. A year later, I put “The Middle” on this CD, and Jesus, it’s actually hard to stop listening to it: the song, after all, is super-tight and incredibly catchy. On the radio, next to sludge-metal, the band is easy to mock; when their sound suddenly seems more immediate and affirming than Sonic Youth (whom they precede on the mix), you have to give them some props.   LAST SUMMER MIX  1. Eminem, “Without Me” 2. Queens of the Stone Age, “No One Knows” 3. Ludacris, “Move B****” 4. Moby, “We Are All Made of Stars” 5. Wilco, “Heavy Metal Drummer” 6. Kylie Minogue, “Love at First Sight” 7. Flaming Lips, “Do You Realize??” 8. Avril Lavigne, “Complicated” 9. Jimmy Eat World, “The Middle” 10. Sonic Youth, “The Empty Page” 11. Pink, “Just Like a Pill” 12. Red Hot Chili Peppers, “By the Way” 13. DJ Shadow, “Six Days”

      I read this on Tuesday night at  Squeezed,  the new monthly variety show sponsored by  urlLink Tangerine Arts Group.  The fact that I played each of these songs on CD to accompany my words was a big reason, I think, that it went over so well. Apologies I can’t do the same here.  “Tennessee”: Arrested Development (4:32)   Hip-hop leaves the urban streets and throws a family reunion down south, a barbecue with cornbread and watermelon, climbing trees and tossing horseshoes. To a 13-year-old white kid from the suburbs, what’s fresh is the down-home earthiness of it all, with funky horns and church wails you can wallow in. It also doesn’t hurt that its Afrocentrism is the right kind of racial sentiment for a young liberal like me, who only has crushes on black girls: it’s political but positive. And so I bring it to a backyard birthday party this summer -- a summer I spend playing driveway basketball with my dorky best friend, watching  urlLink Dominique Dawes  do flips at the Olympics, memorizing the words to the real hot-weather hit, “Baby Got Back.” I’m happy-go-lucky. And I begin high school in a month.   “Maiden Voyage”: Herbie Hancock (7:58)  Jazz in no hurry. You don’t even hear the trade-off between the solos: those light piano clusters and brushed cymbals give it a flow that feels dreamy and timeless. The open sea. At the age of fourteen, I like to lie on the sofa, by the window lighting up the living-room dust, and close my eyes to this tune. I’m attracted to its sophistication in the same way I saw  Howard’s End  by myself, but I’m beginning to feel something, too. Just barely. Tomorrow, I’ll do a crossword puzzle in record time and ride my bike to Downers Grove. The next day, I’ll write a short play marked by pop culture and in-jokes. But three years later, this incredibly cute girl I know tells me she likes me, only a week before I leave for college. I’m ecstatic and ruined, all at once. The last time I see her, on a breezy late-summer afternoon, we lie on her bed listening to her favorite musician, Benny Goodman. When I go home, all I want to hear is this.  “Sporting Life”: The Sea and Cake (4:54)  Sam Prekop keeps it soft like a pillow, and the synthesizers sigh underneath. But listen to those bubbling rhythms, the restless bass. The first time I spend the night at a girl’s house, I’m eighteen and this is on the stereo. There’s a full moon outside her bedroom, crickets buzzing to the slow hot haze of summer nights. At twenty, I’m painting dorm rooms for money, getting sweaty with sawdust, and I spend nights with a different girl. We mix gin-and-tonics and wrap ourselves in sheets. But this is what I sleep in. After midnight, I turn over in bed and slip into these sounds.

      The first CD I ever bought, in early 1992, when I was not yet thirteen, was P.M. Dawn’s  Of the Heart, of the Cross and of the Soul: The Utopian Experience.  It was also the first record I owned that I actually felt protective of. Though the single (the willowy “Set Adrift on Memory Bliss”) hit the top ten, the record wasn’t multi-platinum like the cassettes I had by Boyz II Men and C+C Music Factory and Paula Abdul. And my friend Steve was the only other person I knew that I’d heard praise the laid-back rap duo (he’d bought me the “Set Adrift” cassingle for Christmas ‘91). So there was something private about my fandom: I considered them  my group.   Months later, after picking up Arrested Development’s  3 Years, 5 Months, and 2 Days in the Life of...  and (especially) Digable Planets’  Reachin’: A New Refutation of Time and Space  (dig those long album titles!), I figured that what I was into was “alternative hip-hop.” And so that -- a natural coinage at the start of the alt-rock phenomenon -- became the first musical subgenre, music beyond the radio, that I actively sought out.   It’s hard to remember what was specifically appealing about alt-rap. Critics usually pitted fluffy rap acts like P.M. Dawn against the obviously harder-edged Public Enemy or N.W.A. But it’s not like I had much experience with that music to reject it: I was still by and large listening to Top 40.   The cynical take would be that I had found a way to apply my interest in African-American culture (which in seventh grade English class meant essays about Jesse Owens and Josh Gibson, and a short story based on the Watts riots) to something sufficiently “safe” -- i.e., not so in-your-face with its blackness. But that both denies the genuine Afrocentrism of an act like Arrested Development (“Okay, the way kids are livin’ is 100% European / African boys and girls, set down your Nintendo joysticks right now.”) and paints 13-year-old me as being far more concerned about what-I’m-supposed-to-like than I probably was. I mean, at the same time, I had fun with the bump-and-grind anthem “Doo Doo Brown.”   What I’d like to believe, in retrospect, is that I gravitated toward artists that simply seemed more musically adventurous than most. It didn’t always work out: Us3 sampled Blue Note, like Digable Planets, but had none of the Planets’ clever rhymes and chill vibe; I barely remember the acoustic-guitar-led rap (yes, before Beck!) of Me Phi Me. But I liked the idea of these cross-pollinations: before I was any kind of expert in hip-hop, I couldn’t wait to see it mix with jazz, merge with folk.  I’m thinking about this now as I find myself more interested in hip-hop than I have been in ten years. In high school and college, I listened mostly to indie rock and electronic music, and basically shut hip-hop out of my life (it lingered only in boho kitchen-sink acts like Cibo Matto and Soul Coughing). But last year I heard Prefuse 73’s (mostly) instrumental hip-hop record,  Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives , and started to marvel at the thickness of the beats, the lush assembly of sounds, how compact it all felt, and I wondered why I’d turned my back in the first place. Lately, it’s all I’ve been wanting to hear: some of my favorite post-rock albums suddenly sound thin, and so I replay Aesop Rock’s catchy, flute-looped “Daylight,” Blackalicious’s hypnotic “First in Flight” (feat. Gil Scott-Heron), and Cherrywine’s pervy electro-funk “Girlcrazy.” Of course, I like the circularity there: back in the day, Cherrywine was known as Butterfly, of Digable Planets, and in the summer of 1993 I was replaying “Where I’m From” and “Femme Fetale.”

      There’s something liberating about the list format Matos uses in " urlLink 100 Things ." In a more conventional form, his non-sequiturs would seem either rambling or disjointed. But with the list, a statement like #88 (“I use Right Guard Sport stick. It’s about the only thing that works.) can exist in its own space, without the pressure to cohere. You can take your time with each discrete thought, or let a few of them build into a rhythm. I think this is the idea behind  urlLink David Markson’s  similarly fragmented books, but the high-culture references and overly philosophical bent of  This is Not a Novel  left me cold.

      (If both Dylan and Reich demand fuller attention than I’m otherwise used to, the difference is that Dylan wants to be interpreted, understood, and Reich wants to be experienced, attuned to. In general, I’m more attracted to the latter way of listening.)

      One of the things that interests me about music is how it can be experienced in a remarkable number of ways. You can dance to it at a club; you can space out in your bedroom with headphones; or you can sing along in a car, with the windows rolled down. You can listen to a whole album straight through; you can play your favorite song over and over; or you can set your radio on scan and hear only fragments. You can even create new contexts through mixtapes. Whereas a medium like film seems to hold the darkened movie theater as its ideal mode of viewing, it’s hard to argue that any mode of music-listening is universally preferable. Different kinds of music and situations support different listening styles.   Lately, I’ve been thinking about the variability of “attention” in listening experiences. Ninety-five percent of the time I listen to music, I’m also doing something else: cooking or showering, perhaps, but also more intellectually focused activities like reading or editing textbooks at work. And so I tend to value music that doesn’t require my full attention to have an impact. You might consider this a sacrifice, except it’s actually something that music is uniquely equipped to do: to affect you on a subconscious level, so that you wake up humming a song you can’t place. And above all, this music still has the full ability to function as mood; it is still  suggestive.    Recalling Brian Eno’s  urlLink story  of how he was inspired to create “ambient music,” I like music that I can play at low volume, in the corner of the room, and still be affected by. Hearing Air’s “La Femme D’Argent” anywhere could make me feel slinky and chic (or as my friend Kelsey says, “like I’m in a seventies porn film”). The hushed vocals and delicately plucked guitars of Kings of Convenience are equally transporting, no matter how I hear them: I’m lying in a meadow, or curled up in a cabin at dusk. And this, perhaps, is why I still haven’t warmed up to Bob Dylan: with the key to the songs residing so strongly in the lyrics and narrative, his music doesn’t work in ambient situations. All I hear is standard blues chord progressions; all it suggests is folk festivals and sixties protest documentaries. I’m obviously not used to listening in the way that Dylan seems to demand -- that is, more intently -- but I’m not quite ready to change my habits for him, either.   And yet there is one record I own that summons my attention in a way others don’t. The opening movement of Steve Reich’s  Music for 18 Musicians   -- those four minutes of pulsating chords --  always  makes me want to sit still and just listen. By the time the marimbas hit, I’m locked into the rhythm. I close my eyes; my mind floats; I make up words for each repetitive phrase (“Cigarette wouldn’t talk to you / cigarette wouldn’t talk to you / cigarette wouldn’t talk to you / cigarette” or “But it’s really good for me / but it’s really good for me”). Or I imagine things: a city in winter, a window crying with rain, wind striking the back of a neck. When I listen to it now, as I’m writing this, it even feels like a betrayal: it’s too special, too serious to just throw on the stereo, lights on, phone ringing.

      Since I was sixteen, I’ve been interested in poetry that uses language in ways that defy conventional, objective meaning. During dull moments at my first job, in an insurance office, I’d surreptitiously scribble nonsense phrases that came to mind -- “schizou gangster taps,” for instance -- and then string them together into loose poems. These first poems were mostly word detritus, but I liked the way some of the words sounded next to each other, and I turned the best examples into song lyrics. Over the next year, the associative wordplay I encountered on Soul Coughing’s  Ruby Vroom  and Beck’s  Odelay  seemed to validate my surrealist techniques: I loved how lines like “mouthwash jukebox gasoline” and “full-tilt chromosome cowboy” didn’t seem to mean anything: their enjoyment depended exclusively on their aesthetic properties.   As I continued to write, I grew interested in the visual dimension of language as well, and assembled stanzas with a preponderance of certain letters, using the alphabet as a palette. When I was able to keep the poems focused and concise, they seemed to take on moods and colors. Which then seemed to be the point: writing not for understanding but for experiencing; writing as abstract art.   All of which is to say, for those who have wondered: “Seaworthy Southeast Thesaurus” is one of those “meaningless” phrases. In this case, the words didn’t come to me outright, but appeared one after the other in an anagram dictionary I own (AEHORSTWY, AEHOSSTTU, AEHRSSTUU). I wanted to build a poem around all the words on that page but had some trouble connecting that phrase to “summarize mannequin pneumonia.” So I was stuck with a title. In any event, there’s something about its lack of literalness that I think I like for a weblog that’s been mostly about music, a fundamentally (though not strictly) non-representational form.

      Wondering last night, as I looked through the sixteen new records I’ve heard this year(1), whether I’ll ever be overwhelmed by a record at first listen like I was with  Dots and Loops.  Even Interpol last year, which by year’s end seemed so solidly my number one, took a little while to grow on me.(2)   But in the fall of 1997, I put on the new Stereolab album in my dorm room, lights dim, and everything clicked into place. The sing-song melodies I liked on  Emperor Tomato Ketchup  were still around, but in place of that album’s detached  motorik  beat and funk affectations, there were sweetly shuffling jazz rhythms and warm beds of sad electronic sounds. It felt like a blanket. Or like it was all underwater, the bass deep and prowling the ocean floor, the beats gurgling, the strings like light shimmering in(3).  I was mesmerized.  It’s curious to hear from Stereolab fans who consider  Dots and Loops  the band’s first misstep, a weightless lounge record that doesn’t hold up to the krautrock-inspired energy of their earlier material. Not to say Stereolab doesn’t sometimes falter in this way: I could certainly criticize  Sound-Dust,  the band’s most recent album, for sounding anemic in parts. But although I liked the minimalism of the acclaimed  Transient Random Noise-Bursts (4), which I’d bought that summer,  Dots and Loops  perfected the band in my ears: perfected music period, I sometimes thought.   And so I waited for buses in St. Louis, wearing my new corduroy coat, singing fragments of songs caught in my head in the cold air. I grumbled I couldn’t go to the show (with Mouse on Mars) and was jealous of the shiny concert tee that Summer brought back.  I lit up when the album was played at  urlLink Blake’s Diner  and for the first time counted the time signatures of each track, thrilling at the variations. I played the drum-and-bassish “Parsec” at a party in my suite, disappointed that people dancing couldn’t move to the 5/4. When Rachel at Blake’s asked what it was, I stammered, “Only, like, my favorite album of all time.”    urlLink Josh  thinks what makes  Dots and Loops  unique, even compared to its successors, is that it uses beats in a way that’s more akin to hip-hop or electronic/dance styles than to rock or orchestral pop -- a matter, basically, of how rhythms are integrated into the overall sound.(5) This maybe explains why it works better as ambience than other Stereolab records: it has a continuous hypnotic feel that surrounds you nicely while reading or making tea. The instruments, as Josh points out, don’t always call attention to themselves as horns or synths or whatever: they’re “deployed as sounds.”(6) And yet, unlike many strictly electronic artists, the band is still writing catchy, complex songs. This, for me, was the winning combination.  What I’m wondering, I guess, is whether I’ve gotten to a point where I’ve heard enough music so that I’m no longer struck like that. Like I’ve found the answer. I remember thinking in high school that a really great music would mix jazz with rock in a way that didn’t sound like Blood, Sweat and Tears or Steely Dan. When I eventually discovered Chicago post-rock, I loved it. But these days, what haven’t I already heard, in some form at least?     (1) An unusually high amount for me in August, though I’ve only actually bought seven.  (2) I think I’m naturally suspicious of low male vocals. The first time I saw the Aluminum Group, while working for Minty Fresh, John’s voice actually reminded me of the Barenaked Ladies; I hadn’t yet noticed its campiness.  (3) I like music that drags me under the surface somehow: DJ Shadow’s “Mashin' on the Motorway” interrupts a perfectly good head-nodding record ( The Private Press ) with a nervous vocal track accented with chaotic car horns. Let’s take it back down, man.   (4) Especially “Jenny Ondioline,” which I used to listen to while shaving -- the opening 40 seconds of distortion I spent lathering my face, and by the time the drums kicked in, my razor was ready to go.   (5) Since it’s the only Stereolab album that Andi Toma (of Mouse on Mars) has co-produced, it’s tempting to credit him with this feel -- and yet I just looked at the liner notes and he only actually worked on three tracks (and not necessarily the ones you’d expect).   (6) Currently listening to “The Flower Called Nowhere,” and I realize that I’ve always heard the main rhythmic instrument as a harpsichord, but it’s not all that prominent, and who knows, it could be a high-pitched, ringing acoustic guitar.

      [Read earlier tonight at Squeezed]  I’m nine years old and sleeping over at my friend George’s house. We’re playing Scrabble. George hestitates, then spells out B-I-T-C-H. Bitch. “Heh. It’s my only play.” I look at my tiles and smile. I play TITS. “Me too,” I say. “I just can’t play anything else!” This is plainly a lie. There are plenty of other words I could form. But I’m secretly pleased with this opportunity to talk dirty for a moment. Because, of course, I have an excuse: “I’m just trying to win. I’m just playing the game.”  Eight years later, I’m sleeping over at my friend Chris’s house, where we’ve just finished watching a bootleg video of  Kids , the Larry Clark film about teenage sex. For the past year and a half, I’ve had a terrible crush on Chris and figure tonight’s finally the night to seduce him. When we’re bored with his rock collection, he agrees to play Truth or Dare. Eager to do his bidding, I choose Dare early on, and am forced to drink a whole glass of milk, which he knows I hate. Not quite what I had in mind. But soon enough, I’m asking him Truth: whether he’d ever considered making out with me. And then it’s 4 AM, and his dirty, sweet-smelling hair is in my face, and my right hand is down the front of his boxers.   There’s a fundamental attraction to games like Truth or Dare and Spin the Bottle. They’re borne out of sexual desire, and they even hold the potential to release sexual tension -- but because they’re games, with artificial structures and rules, they also leave an out for their participants. If we can say we’re only playing, then we don’t have to really mean it. We like to believe that these games breed intimacy, but it’s a detached form of intimacy, one in which we’re still in control.   * * *   At some point, Chris puts on Sonic Youth’s album, Experimental Jet Set, Trash and No Star. Until now, I’ve never realized just how sexy the song "Skink" is. Coming off the swirling squall of "Starfield Road," "Skink" opens with a tense, single-note guitar line, and Kim Gordon breathing simple directions: "Here. There." Part of it’s that the song gives me space: Kim growls a little, slinks around the reverb, but also waits for me to hold his shoulder, brush my lips against his. And yet her sing-song is so teasing, too. As she coos "I love" and shrieks "you," I get lost in the thought of some gauzy, cotton-candy-colored slip she’d step out of. "Kinda hazy," she sings, "kinda messy, too."  It’s a few years later before I discover music similarly girlish and unhurried, in the solo records of Tara Jane O’Neil. In a song like "Just Calling,' Tara’s soft, languorous voice spills over what  urlLink David Cozen  calls "slow rinse-cycle guitars": these sad, circular figures that never fail to mesmerize. Even listening to her alone, I understand few of her words -- they’re either too quiet or too obscure -- but I feel enclosed somehow, spun into a mood of lonely charm and slow heartbreak. David  urlLink says  it’s music for feeling crushed: I take this to mean both depressed and in love.  There are certain songs so stark and pretty that they pull us close to them, cheek to cheek in bed. But how much can we really touch, when they’re not even about us, anyway? Can we still feel connected, when all we do is use them, conveniently, when we’re "in the mood"? Do we still feel attached when she comes off the stage with her girlfriend, all drunk and distracted? And is art then nothing more than wandering around our own hearts?

      Twice in the last week I’ve been confronted with a kind of musical critique for which I have little patience anymore. First, I made a mix for a party last weekend that included “Rock Your Body.” The fact that I could barely contain my enthusiasm while playing it (“The bridge is perfect!”) led my friend Rachel to shake her head and sigh, “I don’t see why it’s so great. Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder did this kind of thing much, much better.” Then, the other day at work, a co-worker remarked that she hoped that Madonna “gets her comeuppance in the end.” When I asked her what was so loathesome about Madonna -- who I’ve never much cared for but certainly don’t wish ill upon! --  she recited the typical complaints about “manufactured” pop: “She doesn’t even write her own songs,” “It’s all about the image.” Ho-hum.  What bothers me is that these outright dismissals are always made without any inquiry into the music’s potential pleasure. My first response is always, “Okay, but does it sound good?” (as anyone who’s argued with me about the Strokes or Interpol will remember). I’m not saying that there’s no place for extra-aesthetic criticism of music. I mean, I’ll happily rail against Clear Channel’s depressing homogenization of radio. But even if the new Beyonce single is part of that commercial radio landscape, there’s no reason for my opinion of the song itself to consider the corporate interests that made it happen. Or at least not initially. When I first hear it, it’s just an aesthetic reaction: "Oooh, horns!"    And maybe that’s what I want out of other people. I want them to cast aside their fetishization of the past (or of “authentic” black artists) and just admit, “You know, that Justin Timberlake song  is  pretty tight.” I want them to give up their outdated media critique for just a second to say, “Well, but Madonna  is  fun to dance to.” And if they  really  don’t like it, even on that basic level, I want them to give a genuine aesthetic reason for it: “There’s no hook,” “His voice is too thin,” “It goes on for too long.” I realize, of course, that aesthetic reactions can never be completely pure, and that an expression such as “too thin” often implies an  a priori  ideal (like “not as rich as Michael Jackson’s voice”), but at least it seems more honest: “It just doesn’t work for me.”

      Another troubling quote from that O'Rourke interview, re: Slint's  Spiderland : "Oh, how can you not cry when you hear that record? It's completely indigenous." O'Rourke seems to imply that Slint's indigenous emotion is what makes him cry -- but from another perspective, his crying came first, with "the music = indigenous" merely a convenient rhetoric he used to make sense of that reaction. Yeah, I'm getting a headache.

      What does it mean to say an artwork is contrived? Jim O’Rourke  urlLink claims  to dislike Rachel’s because their music feels bereft of indigenous emotion; the sadness we hear is merely a signifier, a “coded gesture.” But how do you defend a statement like this, when there’s nothing within the work to point toward? (Or is there?) What bothers me is that talk of “contrivance,” even when we’re ostensibly referring only to our immediate reaction (“It feels contrived”), seems to make a presumption about the artist and/or the process of creation. And it’s a slippery slope before accusations of contrivance become part of a cynical predisposition against the work, as in, “Can you believe these indie kids are actually attempting to make serious music?” At a very basic level, Rachel’s simply don’t work for O’Rourke; is there a better way to explain how?

      Singles Reviews (Highly Anticipated Albums Edition)   1.  urlLink Basement Jaxx ft. JC Chasez, "Plug it In" (from  Kish Kash )   Not being much of a dance aficionado, the only other Jaxx track I’ve heard is "Red Alert," which impressed me with its shake-your-ass disco beats and infectious bass. (I’m beginning to think I’m a sucker for disco: the guitar figure in Timberlake’s "Rock Your Body," one of my favorite singles this year, could come straight from Chic.) And while initially this didn’t seem to live up to the sheer fun of that song, I’m finding new, exciting sounds the more I play it:  drippy synths tripping over fuzzed-out power chords, a break with suddenly ethereal voices. It’s dense, man. And especially since I like my beats thick these days, I can see this really taking hold.   2.  urlLink Belle and Sebastian, "Stay Loose" (from  Dear Catastrophe Waitress )    Yeah, it’s too long at 6:41, with a verse-chorus tediously repeated three times. And the melody isn’t nearly as strong as most of their catalog. But Belle and Sebastian are taking enough genuine chances here that it’s cured me of my recent boredom with the band and has me very curious about the new record. Momus is  urlLink right  about the influences ("The Police, Elvis Costello, Joe Jackson, Squeeze"): you can hear echoes of the late seventies in Stuart Murdoch’s affected, reverbed voice, and in the reggae-style delay of the tinny guitar. The hands-down catchiest part of the song, though, is the guitar solo (!), especially as it takes shapes at the end; its most obvious B&S antecedent, oddly enough, is the band’s cover of "The Boys Are Back in Town" that they played on tour last year.   3.  urlLink Outkast, "Hey Ya" (from  Speakerboxxx/The Love Below )    Wow. The first time I heard this song, thanks to a guest-DJ spot Radiohead did on Q101, I could barely contain myself. Mixing crude acoustic, watery bass, and music-box twinkles into an exuberant shout-along, it’s the kind of hip-hop track Wayne Coyne would love. Andre 3000 even outdoes Coyne’s famous charisma – from the very top, when he boasts "My baby don’t mess around," to all those "allrightallrightallrights" to the dazzling break: you’ve got to "shake it like a Polaroid picture!" Single of the year? So far, yes.

      Sometimes, I have trouble getting excited about new records by old favorites, especially if those old favorites are lo-fi, cardigan-wearing indie rockers and these days my curiosity is piqued most by glossy, bass-thumpin’ pop, electronic, and hip-hop. The High Llamas just released an album with practically no drums, much less glitchy flourishes, and even though Sean O’Hagan may be the best performer I’ve ever seen with nothing more than an acoustic guitar, I’m not in the mood for it.  Even though I’ve never quite agreed with the oft-repeated claim that Belle & Sebastian has been all downhill since  Tigermilk,  I was worried that  Dear Catastrophe Waitress  might still feature the kind of earnest yet plodding songs (“Seymour Stein,” “The Chalet Line”), recorded at a weirdly low volume, that didn’t quite work then and are exactly what I want to avoid now.   Fortunately, this isn’t the case. In fact, the last few times I’ve listened to the record, the thought that sticks with me is that some of these songs sound like they should be in a musical! The band has always had that hand-clapping sixties pop feel, but with a few exceptions, they’ve traded in their bedroom melancholy for a bigger, more cleverly arranged, and downright playful sound. And strangely, what that often approaches is the sound of post-sixties musicals like  Jesus Christ Superstar  or even  Hedwig and the Angry Inch,  inspired by the primitive energy of rock and roll but still orchestrated, both musically (there’s a brass section) and theatrically (it’s more self-aware).   “Step into My Office, Baby,” for instance, the album’s lead-off track and single, could be the opening number to a 1950’s workplace comedy ( How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying ?), with its punchy beat, lyrics consisting of silly sexual euphemisms, and two moments where I imagine the dancers on stage freeze and the spotlight narrows on our lead, Stuart, whose sweet tenor solo lifts toward the rafters just before the drums pick up again. This song is immediately followed by the title track, with its rapidly swirling strings, bleating trumpet, and huge cymbal crashes straight out of a Leonard Bernstein overture.  But it’s “Roy Walker” that really takes the cake. First, a mixed-gender chorus cheerily coos, “I wondered all night about you / I’ve been here for years, just wanderin’ around the neighborhood.” (Is it just me, or does the word  neighborhood  makes it ten times more like a musical?) Then, our second male lead, Stevie, sings his solo while the cast snaps their fingers in a circle around him; the verses are crammed with syllables, Sondheim-like. And before long, it’s the eight-bar instrumental break, with woodblocks, noisemakers, and an electric guitar solo: I like to picture the snappily dressed men tossing their female dance partners in the air and catching them; I half expect to hear improvised whoops and cheers.    Or maybe, as some have suggested, this is just a 1970’s AM pop sound, akin to the Carpenters or the Osmonds. In either case, it’s a step in the right direction.

      "...I think most of us can hardly avoid being critical, either by the amount of time we give to art, or by our lack of time, what we trouble to learn about it, or forget about it, what we choose to value or to ignore. Well, a writer shares this natural critical behavior with all spectators. But when he starts to write, the normalcy of the critical spirit transforms itself, I think, into the perversity of the critical act. For it is only in writing about his artistic experiences that a man realizes how unrecoverable they are and, worse still, that he is a professional handler or at least observer of his own feelings. He must tamper in some manner with his reactions in order to externalize them. It is a very nervous-making proposition."  --Max Kozloff, "Critical Schizophrenia and the Intentionalist Method" (1965)

      Another piece for  urlLink Squeezed.    (Because of both length constraints and the nature of the audience, some of this may seem elementary. My two regrets: 1. That I gloss over the history of sampling pre- Paul's Boutique  and thus give the Beastie Boys too much credit. 2. That I couldn't incorporate mash-ups/bootlegs into the piece [though I did include "Smells Like Booty" and "A Stroke of Genie-us" on a mix CD I made for the occasion, to much general amusement].)       Robert Rauschenberg,  Retroactive II   The idea of sampling -- appropriating previously recorded music into new contexts -- has existed almost as long as recorded music itself. In the 1930s, John Cage was writing symphonies for twelve record players, and in the 50s he created mixes of environmental noise. But it wasn't until the second wave of hip-hop in the late 80s that a popular record was so purposefully built around gathering eclectic source material;  Paul's Boutique   by the Beastie Boys became famous for layering nonstop clips of the Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Sly and the Family Stone, and James Brown under the rappers' nasal rhymes. Here, the sample wasn't just a hook, as it was with other hip-hop records, it was a barrage of noises bumping against one another: it was texture. And it stood as a promise that a hip-hop song could be something like the pop artist Robert Rauschenberg's visual collages, where photos of army helicopters in Vietnam are  urlLink juxtaposed  with 17th-century engravings and actual paint smears in a busy, colorful display.  Because of the vast potential that groups like the Beastie Boys and De La Soul hinted at, many consider Gilbert O'Sullivan's successful 1991  urlLink lawsuit  against Biz Markie, for sampling without permission, to have put an end to an art form that was just getting started. Certainly, having to pay for samples meant fewer recognizable songs in the mix; something from the Beatles catalogue, after all, now cost millions of dollars. But I like to think it also forced hip-hoppers to be more judicious with their appropriation, to find even more unusual sounds to build raps around. Even those who could afford expensive samples looked further afield -- in 1998, Jay-Z scored a hit with "Hard-Knock Life," with a chorus from the musical  Annie.   In the mid-nineties, three of my favorite records were Soul Coughing's  Ruby Vroom,  Cibo Matto's  Viva! La Woman,  and Beck's  Odelay,  and what I loved most were the left-field samples: empty spaces were crammed with Warner Bros. cartoon music, 1940's girl groups, Duke Ellington big band, spaghetti western soundtracks, and obscure funk, not to mention squeaky doors and braying donkeys. The fact that none of these albums were  really hip-hop albums, either, was even more exciting. Though the artists certainly drew inspiration from hip-hop, it was less a framework and more just another style, an added element in the mix. Any sense of a framework at all was rapidly disappearing: it was all just sound.  As a budding musician myself, this was all immensely appealing to me. When I began writing my own songs in 1995, samples were very much part of my musical M.O. Without the proper technology, however, this mostly consisted of cueing a record to play for the duration of the song, underneath my voice and Yamaha keyboard, and relying on happy accidents of synchronicity -- the climax of a keyboard solo, for instance, coinciding with a shrill, hissing violin from a ragtime record.  A couple years later, I started to focus exclusively on the samples. I had already taught myself a basic wave-editing program so I could loop sound through my computer speakers; now I got interested in manipulating the samples in more interesting ways, especially mixing several samples together. For my very first entirely electronic composition, I spliced the guitar riff from Blur's "Song 2" with some meandering jazz piano and a WXRT radio promo. Another track featured Malcolm X shouting over the intro to "Girlfriend in a Coma" until interrupted by a Ben Folds Five drum break.   Soon I was creating three-minute collages with, like, a dozen samples, Sonic Youth's dissonant guitar waves bleeding into Branford Marsalis noodling on the sax, and then suddenly, a Korean newscast I taped off the TV, set to a funk beat. Of course, it was all incredibly sloppy, but I didn't care. Interestingly enough, my friend Chris was also making audio collages at the time, but in a completely different style -- he would take very small bites of music and then speed them up, slow them down, reverse them, do whatever he could so that they were basically unrecognizable: the mix became either abstract noise or fucked-up beats. I was impressed with his technique, but I had a hard time enjoying his music. I realized that the potential I saw in this art lay in matching different kinds of sounds, different genres of music, to create new combinations -- but part of the fun in that was that these elements were also distinct, could be picked apart and identified. I liked being able to marvel at how well the puzzle pieces fit.  This seems to be a key distinction between different types of sample-based music: whether the seams are visible or invisible. But I'd argue that musicians need not even process their samples as thoroughly as Chris did to merit inclusion in the invisible-seams camp. What's remarkable about someone like DJ Shadow, whose 1996 record  Endtroducing  is said to have been the first hip-hop record composed entirely of samples, is that we hear the funky drumming and spooky piano as distinct entities yet feel as if they were made for each other, not culled from two separate sources. Shadow's tastes are wide-ranging enough that he's as likely to sample Tangerine Dream as he is James Brown, but his interest in creating moods and soundscapes -- his music is often described as "cinematic" -- means that you'll rarely hear "wacky juxtapositions" on his records. Listening to artists like DJ Shadow, you don't so much wonder, "Where'd that sample come from?" You wonder, "How'd he create that whole sound?"  On the other hand, listening to a song like "Frontier Psychiatrist," by the Avalanches, you're constantly conscious that the sounds are found material, scrounged from piles of vinyl. Part of this is because the juxtapositions are meant to be somewhat incongruous and therefore funny, as in a horse whinnying alongside alarming mariachi horns. Part of it's also because so many of the samples are speech-based, and when we're used to music with a single lead voice, hearing a dozen random blips of dialogue automatically seems fragmentary -- even if the Avalanches do make them rhyme: "He was white as a sheet / And he also made false teeth." One reason a sampling artist might make the seams visible like this is to use sound as  signifiers.  I get the impression that the Avalanches are interested in the actual words "frontier psychiatrist" and what such a concept might entail; they use samples as a means of suggesting it through association: the call of the nebbish doctor, for instance, answered by the Yosemite Sam-like sheriff. It's an excellent example of collage, although I sometimes think of the Avalanches' whole album,  Since I Left You,  with supposedly over 900 samples strewn throughout, as more of a bright, messy painting -- each color separate but streaking and jumping over the whole canvas, filling every last corner with cherry-red or lime-green or gold.

      Keith Harris now has a  urlLink blog.  This is very good news, as he's one of the funniest  and  most dead-on music writers I've read lately. If you don't believe me, check out  urlLink this  piece, and especially  urlLink this  one, which describes Jimmy Eat World thusly: "You know, the sort of post-Blink pop-punk bounce so tuneful, disposable, and insistent that, as it fades out, you expect to see Tara Reid packing up stuffed animals and exclaiming, 'Can you believe we're finally graduating from college?'"  More soon, I promise.

         1. Last night, I watched  Style Wars,  a great documentary on the whole graffiti scene in early 80s NYC, and one thing that struck me was how multicultural the movement was. Because it's so tied to hip-hop culture -- it's one of the original four elements of hip-hop (along with rapping, DJing, and breakdancing) -- you think of graffiti as a predominantly black (or Hispanic) art form. But not only did whites participate in subway bombings, they sometimes, as in the case of  urlLink Min One , joined crews with black kids. I'm especially curious about this historical moment, when these kinds of cross-racial assocations were no longer a big deal, politically, and so cultures had room to clash, merge, and disappear in more interesting ways. For me, Min One stands out as probably the earliest "wigger" I've seen on film.  2. In Jonathan Lethem's new novel,  The Fortress of Solitude,  Dylan Ebdus, a white kid in mid-1970s Brooklyn, runs around bombing the city with his black friend, Mingus Rude. (Their common tag, "Dose," echoes real-life tagger  urlLink Doze .) But by the end of that decade, Dylan's given up graffiti and gotten into punk, into Devo and the Talking Heads. When he becomes a music journalist later in life, it's not rap he's nostalgic for, but the soul and early funk records that Mingus's father recorded. If the birth of graffiti culture can be dated to 1971 (when  urlLink Taki 183  was written about in the  New York Times ), and the birth of rap to 1979 (when the Sugarhill Gang's "Rapper's Delight" was released), is that window meaningful? (Or is it erased by people like Dylan's friend Arthur Lomb, probably the earliest "wigger" I've encountered in fiction?)   3. I wish that  urlLink Sasha Frere-Jones  had made good on his  urlLink promise  to write more about the music in  The Fortress of Solitude  -- mostly because I suspect that hip-hop played a more integral role in his childhood than in Lethem's (if we can assume that Dylan is, at least somewhat, a stand-in for the author), and I'd be curious to see how their experiences compare. (Frere-Jones also grew up in Brooklyn and is three years younger than Lethem; this gap doesn't seem that wide, except it's the difference between hearing "Rapper's Delight" when you're fifteen and treating it like a novelty record, and hearing it when you're twelve and not being able to remember much before it.) I guess there's just something disappointing about the adult Dylan Ebdus turning into a boomer critic like Nick Hornby, romanticizing black music but never anything after 1980. (And disappointing not in a moral sense so much as I just want to read serious fiction that mentions Kurtis Blow!)

      Right around the end of November each year, I start to fret at the prospect of composing a year-end top-ten list. For one, I never feel like I hear enough new albums for such a list to even be meaningful. (This year, it was 30.) But mostly, I can never quite figure out the right criteria to use. I’m usually torn as to which should get preference: the imperfect record that really spoke to me, or the (more) perfect record that didn’t as much. (Let’s ignore the can of worms that the word "perfect" suggests there.)  But a few weeks ago, I happened upon Sasha Frere-Jones’s  urlLink justification  for rating  Liz Phair  as his #1: "My list is based as closely as possible on the semi-empirical: how many times I listened to the thing. iTunes helped me track this, and my family and feeble memory filled in the blanks." This seemed like a perfectly reasonable approach, and one that neatly avoided all those internal objective/subjective debates, not to mention the inevitable last-minute changes of heart.   Now, I haven’t followed SFJ’s method to the T (doesn’t it unfairly punish end-of-year releases?), but I’ve attempted to ground my list in a similar rationale. What follows are the ten records that positively impacted me the most in 2003, records I listened to repeatedly, but also just records I cared about. As the new year settles in, I’ll probably have a better idea of what constitutes my "favorites," and I’m sure the rankings will shift. This is all I can do for now.  (Note: This entry is for #10-#6. I’ll be posting #5-#1 later this week. Enjoy!)   10. Schneider TM,  6 Peace EP  (Mute)   Okay, so it’s kind of a cop-out -- half of these songs have appeared elsewhere, and the ones that haven’t are merely remixes of tracks from last year’s  Zoomer.  But there were probably a half dozen records hovering just below this top ten, and when I remembered how  urlLink smitten  I was the first time I heard this EP, I figured it deserved the final place. Like his German compatriots the Notwist*, Schneider TM transgresses the boundaries between electronic and organic music, mixing gently strummed guitars with glitchy beats and a bittersweet pop sheen. Now that I’ve heard the full-length, I admire "Frogstears" (a remix of "Frogtoise") even more: stripped down to harmonica, acoustic guitar, and digital vocals, the song’s absurd dream narrative becomes unexpectedly soulful.   *The Notwist’s  Neon Golden  received a U.S. release in 2003, but since I had the fortune of hearing it in 2002, it’s not on this list.    9. The North Atlantic,  Wires in the Walls  (Stay In Get Down)   Full disclosure: I’m friends with this  urlLink band . Good enough that they’ve stayed at my house when they’ve played Chicago. But when I first heard material from this album live, two years ago, I was disappointed -- their previous release, an endearingly amateurish emo record indebted to Braid and American Football, had sported these super-catchy clean guitar lines that seemed to disappear once their second guitarist quit the band. Only after really spending time with  Wires in the Walls  did it become apparent that this record not only far outshines its precedessor, it’s one of my favorite rock albums of 2003. Songs built around throaty vocals and big, confident riffs routinely descend into dance-punk explosions, complete with loping bass and whammy bar. And the bitterness and desperation evident in songs like "Scientist Girl" and "The Bottom of This Town" are complemented by unexpected pop flavors (keyboards! singalongs!). Somebody sign these boys already.   8. Broken Social Scene,  You Forgot it in People  (Arts & Crafts/Paper Bag)   At the Empty Bottle in July, Broken Social Scene put on probably my favorite show of the year. With at least half a dozen musicians on stage, including three guitarists in a parallel line up front, the Canadian collective performed with so much unchecked exuberance, it was hard not to swagger along with them. Hard to imagine for a band whose first record was a mostly unnoticed ambient affair, but  You Forgot it in People  neatly marries the loosely repetitive structures of post-rock bands like Do Make Say Think (with whom BSS shares a member) with joyful Strokes-ian noise pop. Although the record loses steam toward the end, the fuzzy bass line that snakes through "Stars and Sons" and the mesmerizing helium-and-banjo duet of "Anthems for a Seventeen-Year-Old Girl" kept me hitting repeat.   7. The Postal Service,  Give Up  (Sub Pop)   I liked going to parties in the last few months of 2003, because as soon as "Hey Ya!" came on (as it inevitably did),  everyone  -- emo kids, pop fans, bearded alt-country listeners -- sang along and dutifully shook it like a Polaroid picture. There was something heartwarming about such  urlLink near-universal appeal , a sense of being part of a common culture at a time when the traditional gestures no longer suffice. The Postal Service didn’t quite make it to No. 1 on  Billboard,  but among indie-friendly crowds, it seemed to have a similarly unifying effect. Fans of Ben Gibbard’s smart, sincere lyrics danced with folks who dug Jimmy Tamborello’s swirling electronic textures; lovers of new wave everywhere climbed on board. Even as some of the songs do sound like early 80s pop (cf. the Human League), there’s a pleasing novelty in the up-to-date IDM beats; it’s entirely possible, as my friend Matt suggested, that this will shape up to be among the year’s most influential records. And yeah, I guess I liked it, too.   6. M83,  Dead Cities, Red Seas, and Lost Ghosts  (Gooom/Labels)   I’ve never gotten into My Bloody Valentine. I have  Loveless  on cassette somewhere, but whenever I play it, the supposedly transcendent squall sounds like someone singing underneath a vacuum cleaner, and I shut it off. But I want to like it, because I’m sympathetic to the premise: noise so constant and otherworldly it becomes something gorgeous and pure. M83 makes music like this, with the same ethereal drone and muffled drums as shoegazer bands like MBV, but composed entirely on synthesizers, with lots of ridiculous sawtooth waves. (In  urlLink Jess Harvell’s  words, " Loveless  remade by Vangelis.") And maybe that’s the key distinction for me, because as soon as I heard this album, no more than a month ago, I fell in love with it. There’s an inescapable beauty in the way "Unrecorded" shifts suddenly from dizzying Eurotechno to a pastoral landscape of ambient gurgles and then the relentless thrum of "Run Into Flowers," or the way the warm, drifting organs of "Church" are overlaid with synths at once screeching and serene. This album could even be higher on the list, but in light of its newness, I wanted to stay conservative.

      Wishes and lists, for the last month of the year:   Phil Collins, "Another Day in Paradise" (1989)   We rode down to Peoria with car windows frozen, boys in the backseat reading baseball paperbacks, playing Tiger electronic handheld soccer, restless. The radio interspersed alerts of the U.S. invasion of Panama as I drew on the windows, trying to see out. Were we at war? Cool. On the nameless lonely highways of central Illinois, we scanned the FM dial, and there was Billy Joel, hepped up about rock n' roller cola wars and trouble in the Suez, a song I liked because it was just a list! Which, not only did I love lists period, but it was such a crazy way to structure a pop song, revolutionary even; I walked out of the barber shop hearing it for the first time stunned. But later, when the car glided into the valley at last, it was on a sheet of sleepy keyboards, sharp drum-machine kicks, and an echoing melancholy voice. I had a vague notion that underneath the exuberance of "We Didn't Start the Fire" was some broad  urlLink statement  about history and politics, but there was no mistaking the serious tenor of "Another Day in Paradise." Phil Collins painted a stark portrait of the homeless crisis, a woman in trouble ignored by her fellow man, and struck a suitably concerned note: "Is there nothing more anybody can do?" Since I never actually understood the  urlLink subtext   of Suzanne Vega's "Luka," this was probably one of the first social-issue songs I consciously liked. And despite the fact that it was precisely the kind of simple faux-gravitas that would later lead me to write bad poems about inner-city violence and AIDS, on that late December day, the chill in its chiming melody, its moody bass, felt right.   The Cardigans, "Lovefool" (1996)   A week before I left for college, I fell in love with this amazingly cute girl from home. In the months before I returned for winter break, we wrote each other daily e-mails, we talked softly on the phone when my suitemates were rowdy on vodka and football, she invited me to Homecoming, she completely ignored me at Homecoming, we broke off whatever we actually had, and a few weeks later she started dating one of my best friends. On Christmas Eve, I sat in a cubicle and drew a cartoon of the two of them, captioned "my favorite couple," even though when I accompanied them to  urlLink  Jerry Maguire   a few days before, and she sat between us, I wanted nothing more than to hold her hand. It started snowing. People were leaving. There was this empty stretch of road between this hospital I worked at over the holidays and the place I was now learning to call "my parents' house," and I would drive through its darkness that month, listening to Q101's  urlLink Top 5 at 5 : #4, Soul Coughing, "Super Bon Bon"; #3, Counting Crows, "A Long December"; #2, Bloodhound Gang, "Fire Water Burn"; and #1, the Cardigans, "Lovefool." I had a big soft spot for lounge music, so I was happy to hear the Cardigans on rock radio, as I turned up those lightly insistent synths, the straight beat, the cheery chorus sounding more like ABBA than anything they'd ever done. Against that sunny backdrop, Nina Persson's kittenish complaints felt immaterial. "I wonder what I could have done in another way to make you stay," she cooed. I gripped the steering wheel and sang along. Only years later did I realize I'd actually been singing along to my life.

      I don't want to be an elitist indie kid about this, but there's something disconcerting about the fact that half the comments on Dave Pajo's  urlLink LiveJournal  are from users with names like BillyCorgan_Fan or Pumpkins4Ever. These are people, I suspect, who first heard of Pajo through his involvement with Zwan (a band I'm convinced was only created to play at rock-radio festivals) -- and they accordingly treat him like a "rock star," rather than the  urlLink prolific  but fairly low-profile post-rocker I've always known him as. I do have to say, though, that he and Paz Lenchantin make a  urlLink cute couple .

      I'm pretty sure that the first blog I ever came across, several years ago, was  urlLink josh blog , a collection of thoughts on music and philosophy written by a student at Iowa State University named Josh Kortbein. At the time, it was a real revelation, and not just for the novelty of the blog format. In short, I was extremely sympathetic to Josh's  urlLink main reason  for starting the blog. In wanting to write about the arts myself, I had also felt uncomfortable about the aesthetic problems raised by the typical approach to writing reviews, and was frustrated by the limitations of academic essays. With its brilliant stray thoughts and semi-narratives, josh blog encouraged my belief that there was a value in the personal response and the margin-scribbled insight. I also fucking loved that Josh was seriously interested in the phenomenology of aesthetic experiences: he'd write about what it was like to hear a piece of music on headphones compared to in a distant room; he'd evaluate why he was drawn to particular records and not others. I even discovered  urlLink ILM  through his site (although, to be honest, I forgot about it until I went Googling for "pazz and jop" a while later).   So it's with some sadness that I've discovered that the blog (which my last post just linked to, even) is no longer running. In its place is a short message from Josh: "I've closed up in order to take care of myself. Thanks for reading and occasionally writing." I sure hope he's okay. Thanks for the inspiration.

      Sometimes I write about music; sometimes I write about the  urlLink philosophical implications  of words. (Oh no, I'm turning into  urlLink Josh !)    Notes on Hello   1. There’s a moment in  urlLink  All the Real Girls  , last year’s remarkable film about young love, where 18-year-old Noel leans into her new older boyfriend, Paul, and says, "Come here, let me tell you a secret." When he puts his ear up to her mouth, she simply whispers, "Hello hello hello hello." In this incipient romance, the first real relationship he’s had after years of empty sex, and her first relationship ever, those "hellos" act simultaneously as a "sweet nothing" (words words words) and as a wake-up call. Here she is. No:  here she is.    2. Because the word doesn’t really mean anything. We can define it in terms of its context of usage -- "used as a greeting," "used especially on the telephone" -- but there’s no actual reference, nothing it signifies. It’s like defining "table" as "a word used in kitchen situations," with no mention of flat surfaces or legs. And so, without any anchor to the physical world, "hello" slips into babble, becomes a word to fill space. Asked to test a microphone or otherwise showcase our voice, we resort to hellos: "Hello, hello, is this thing on?" We answer the phone with "hello" because we have to say something. It doesn’t really matter what.  3. But when a word that signifies nothing external is used repetitively like that, it  does  begin to reference something. Even without meaningful content, what’s still there is the voice, the speaker,  you.   And so "hello" becomes a statement of existence. On the phone, where you’re physically absent from your interlocutor, "hello" is really what summons you, calls you into being. Silence. "Hello?" You appear. When Jim Morrison announces all at once, "Hello, I love you, won’t you tell me your name?" the seemingly superfluous word at the beginning is used to set the scene: "Here I am." It’s the equivalent of stage directions:  Jim Morrison enters  … and thus becomes a character, a part of the world.   4. Of course, most of the time, "hello" is not  merely  a statement of existence. If the reason we speak is to communicate, it is also an engagement, an attempt at connection. Lost in the forest, or in the dark, we shout "Hello out there!" to anyone who might be around. In other words: "I’m here. Are you?" In both  All the Real Girls  and the Doors song, in contexts of love, it carries the implication, "Please notice me as I’ve noticed you."  And in conversation, when our partner is no longer on the same wavelength, how do we shock them into understanding us again? "Uh, hel- lo ?"  Whereas words like "hi" or "hey" usually function as simple nods of recognition, "hello" has a greater purpose: a declaration, a proposition, a communion.

      M. H. Abrams’s  Glossary of Literary Terms  (5th ed.) defines  enjambement  as a poetic situation in which "the pressure of the incomplete syntactic unit toward closure carries on over the end of the verse-line." For example, note the ends of lines 2–4 in Keats’s  Endymion :   A thing of beauty is a joy forever: Its loveliness increases; it will never Pass into nothingness, but still will keep A bower quiet for us, and a sleep Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing.   I learned the term in 12th-grade English class, after inadvertently employing it in an irreverent poem about our assistant principal. But recently, I’ve noticed that it’s one of Jay-Z’s favorite tricks. Here’s "Change Clothes," the first single from  The Black Album :   He and the boy Pharrell make beautiful music / He is to the East Coast what Snoop is / To the West Coast, what Face is to Houston   Or his guest rap on Beyonce’s "Crazy in Love":   Ol’ G, big homey, the one and only / Stick bony, but the pocket is fat like Tony / Soprano, the ROC handle like Van Axel   It’s a useful technique, clever even, but I’m unsure about the way Jay-Z still pauses at the end of the line instead of rapping straight through. (Or at least he does in these examples; I haven’t actually heard 90% of his recorded output.) When reading poetry aloud in school, I always made a point of avoiding the simplistic sing-songiness of rhyming couplets. With Shakespeare especially, it seemed important to preserve the natural rhythms of speech; if the couplets weren’t immediately identifiable, one still felt an inherent musicality in the language. Plus, it just seems like it would be more impressive for the man who considers himself the best rapper on the planet to demonstrate a bit more verbal dexterity. Or am I expecting too much?

      (Continued)   5. Basement Jaxx,  Kish Kash  (Astralwerks)   So, I’m one of those people who refused to take anything resembling house music seriously until quite recently, figuring it was probably fun to dance to (that is, if you were even into dancing) but not inspired or inventive enough to warrant appreciation on a more attentive level. Which is stupid, because I’ve always held a soft spot for disco, which is as rhythmically straight-forward and diva-centered as house. But so once I realized that  urlLink ILM  was a de facto Basement Jaxx  urlLink fan club , I came around to the British dance act’s newest record,  Kish Kash.  What I liked almost immediately was the playful, falsetto-topped bounce of "Hot 'N Cold," on the album’s more downtempo second half. But those first three songs, which at first blush seemed too dense and in-your-face chaotic -- Cockney rapper Dizzee Rascal shouting over sexy moaning and hard beats in a crowded Persian bazaar ("Lucky Star") -- now feel like a beautiful knock-out punch.   4. Belle and Sebastian,  Dear Catastrophe Waitress  (Rough Trade)    I like what I wrote  urlLink here . And I especially like what  urlLink Kenan  wrote in agreement (though I never even said the G-word!): "Jaymc nailed it when he said it sounds like they're moving away from the dour retro poppy Scottish kind of gayness and into the Broadway musical kind of gayness. It's still pretty gay. I like it."  The most consistently good pop album of the year.   3. Prefuse 73,  One Word Extinguisher  and  Extinguished: Outtakes  (Warp)    Scott Herren’s new material under the name Prefuse 73 is certainly more restless than his 2001 debut --  One Word Extinguisher  spans 22 songs in an hour; the outtakes collection,  Extinguished  offers 23 in half that time -- but what it provides him is greater emotional range. The full-length runs from a busy, boisterous rap, courtesy rising star Diverse, to cuts like "Detchibe," sounding like mellow 70s jazz played by a band of modems, and "Why I Love You," featuring samples of R&B melisma fractured so as to sound almost sinister (and a perfect segue to a Da Brat song on a mix CD I made). But throughout the two records are these thick, stuttering beats and shards of melody that satisfied both my newfound need for bangin’ rhythms and my time-tested interest in head-nodding, space-out sounds.    2. Radiohead,  Hail to the Thief  (Capitol)   The day after the release of  Hail to the Thief  -- the first new Radiohead album since I officially became a fan of the band -- I went over to Matt’s and we put it on at full blast, leaned back, got high, and closed our eyes. By the end of "Sit Down, Stand Up," with Thom shouting "the raindrops!" as if he was on a constantly accelerating treadmill, caught in the midst of electronic precipitation and alien phaser gunfire, I was already blown away.  It struck me as a beautiful blend of the minor-key experimentalism of  Kid Amnesiac  and the bombast of  OK Computer : arpeggiated guitar lines actually opening into tight, jagged riffs underneath millions of brilliant effects. A fantastic listening experience, and yet recently when I’ve put it on, for some reason, I’ve barely been able to get through the first few tracks -- the life suddenly seems sucked out. And I wonder if Radiohead made a record so meticulously impressive that it lacks the kind of human breath or space we need in order to connect over time. Maybe, but still...   1. OutKast,  Speakerboxxx/The Love Below  (Arista)   The main criticism of this record is that the separate discs supposedly dilute the brilliance of Big Boi and Andre 3000’s partnership, and that straying from that winning dynamic results in missteps and filler. Okay, but I don’t care. Maybe it’s because one of my New Year’s resolutions for 2003 was to get into more hip-hop, and after a few brief excursions into indie rap, this record -- as lyrically engaging as indie, as outright catchy as R&B and funk, and as slick and bouncy as mainstream rap -- was exactly what I need to hear. Or maybe it’s because in this age of mp3s (I installed iTunes at home late last year), I became less interested in the integrity of albums and more in great individual tracks -- which, everything else aside, this record has in droves. (Even an understated number like "Reset," buried near the end of  Speakerboxxx,  has these breathy female harmonies that, next to the guttural rhymes, sound amazingly sad and hypnotic.) I mean, for those who sneer, "Well, it’d make an all-right single album" (and surely it would), then start uploading and get to work! And then show me an album where the hits keep coming for longer.

      There's an  urlLink article  in  The New Yorker  last week by classical music critic Alex Ross that talks at one point about the promise of the iPod as a new mode of listening to music. With an entire CD collection uploaded and shuffle mode on, you can bounce from one song to the next, finding unexpected connections among artists of wildly different genres or styles. Ross writes about this development as a potentially good thing for classical music: if today’s listeners seek to mix and integrate a range of recordings, outside of the context of albums or radio stations or performance spaces, then much of the negative cachet of classical -- the hushed reverential tones of classical DJs, the bourgeois affect of the gown-and-tuxedoed opera-goer, whatever else ghettoizes the genre -- can disappear.  "On the iPod," Ross writes, "music is freed from all fatuous self-definitions and delusions of significance. ... Instead, music is music."  I don’t listen to much classical music, but my iTunes playlist regularly careens from the Beach Boys to Aphex Twin to R. Kelly and the  Muppet Movie  soundtrack, and I’d wager that the same leveling effect that Ross mentions has shaped the way I listen to commercial pop music. A few years ago, it seemed like most of what I paid attention to was smart and somewhat sedate hipster bands like Stereolab and Tortoise, and it didn’t bother me that I no longer knew any of the current songs in the  urlLink  Billboard  Top 40 . As much as I spoke of the sheer beauty of my favorite music, I used taste as a means of identity formation, too. And as I saw it, pop music was antithetical to who I was. As a lifelong liberal and budding intellectual, I couldn’t quite cotton to songs that presented insipid understandings of love and relationships, especially when mass-marketed by greedy corporations to uncritical teenagers. I also found some of the music’s primitive sexual politics faintly embarrassing. There  was  one song that broke through --  I couldn’t resist the bouncy harpsichord and witty internal rhymes of "The Real Slim Shady," and I was fascinated by Eminem’s carefully manipulated public persona, which was hotly debated in the press. But I couldn’t bring myself to buy the record, as I just couldn’t imagine something with a glossy booklet and Parental Advisory sticker occupying shelf space next to my cardboard-sleeved indie-rock discs.    About a year or so ago, a few things transpired to change my mind. For one, I was already starting to feel bored with my same-old interests. Then I happened upon an  urlLink online message board  full of intelligent published music critics who unexpectedly yawned at Wilco and fawned over Jay-Z. And while flipping through the radio in my car one day, I caught the end of Justin Timberlake's "Cry Me a River," and marveled at it how slick and dense and catchy it sounded; in another  New Yorker   urlLink article , from last summer, Alex Ross calls it ''the most polyphonically complex teenybopper ballad in history." That was it. I added Power 92 and B96 and Kiss 103.5 to my radio presets. After ten years, I was back on pop's side.   If you've been at a party with me in the last twelve months, chances are you've heard me rave about Justin Timberlake at one time or other. For me, Justin is Exhibit A of commercial pop's potential, the artist I cite for those friends who are skeptical of anything played on MTV. (And somewhat sadly, I seek those people out, because as we all know, there's none as zealous as the recently converted.) For my money, "Cry Me a River" isn't even his best song; there are some days I actually consider it the least satisfying of the four singles on the album, next to the shimmering disco of "Rock Your Body," the darkly sexual, Spanish-guitar-inflected "Like I Love You," and the freewheeling, almost Afro-Cuban feel of "Senorita," with a call-and-response section reminiscent of early hip-hop -- you know, turntables set up on asphalt in the summer and everyone eating ice cream and singing along. There's also just something incredibly charismatic about the dude. If you saw "Senorita" on the Grammys last week, with Justin on the Fender Rhodes piano and backed up by Arturo Sandoval's band, you got a pretty good sense of his infectious energy, as he and the jazz great traded off improvised vocal wails and trumpet bleats.     I first heard my man JT on the radio, but as the singles slipped down the charts, I still had them on my iTunes, as mp3s. And I'd listen to them the way great pop songs should be listened to: spontaneously, in short bursts, with the volume turned up. I'd get the urge to hear "Rock Your Body" and I’d swivel my chair over to the computer and press play. People are busy  urlLink complaining  that the proliferation of mp3s will lead to the death of the album, but there's no mistaking it’s a fantastic way, maybe the best way, to listen to singles. With no context required, you can create your own context. You can give pop songs a chance.   Toward the end of last year, when I was a little tired of Justin and the ubiquitous "Hey Ya!" seemed to have run its course, I caught wind of a pop song a few weeks away from being released to radio. Although the first single from the new Britney Spears record ("Me Against the Music," ft. Madonna) struck me as forced and bland, I downloaded "Toxic" and found myself amazed. Justin’s former sweetheart sounded like a breathy machine, getting light-headed on an Eastern scale amidst swooping Bernard Herrmann strings and stuttering 007 twang-guitar. Even though it’s currently on B96 and Kiss 103.5 (climbing the charts last week to #22), it's still what I play at home when I need a sugar rush. Although in the grand scheme of things, liking Britney seems even more suspect than liking Justin, given how prefab her pop-star persona is, the mp3 never reminds me of that. When it’s dropped between, say, Basement Jaxx and Philip Glass, music is music.  Bonus link:  urlLink Sasha Frere-Jones asks, "Why are some writers so afraid of Justin Timberlake?"

      Apologies, of course, for the blogging drought. I was on vacation in San Francisco earlier this month, enjoying the beautiful weather (70s and sunny the whole time), and only now am I feeling really settled again. Anyway.  There's a scene toward the end of  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind  that I keep thinking about. [SPOILER ALERT] Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet), who believe they've just met and fallen in love, have each received cassettes in the mail on which they badmouth the other in the context of a prolonged, unhappy relationship. (At this point in the film, we clearly understand how this is possible; the characters don't, or are just learning.) Clementine sits on Joel's couch for seemingly the first time, sharing glances with this sweetly shy man she's just met, but the tape he's received is also playing in the background: an embarrassing succession of complaints he's made against her, laced with weariness and bitter resentment. It's a remarkable scene in the way it sketches the entire scope of their relationship, the present and the future (although it's really the recent past), in one moment. It presents the eager, generous sentiment of puppy love -- "I would never hurt you" -- in the same space as the inevitably hurtful realities of long-term relationships.   And this, I think, is the film's major accomplishment: it uses its narrative experimentation, its sci-fi logic to reach an emotional truth about love that couldn't be ascertained otherwise. I'm reminded of Rick Moody's short story "Boys," collected in  Demonology  ( urlLink PDF ;  urlLink RealAudio ). The story is about a family with a pair of sons, and the narrative gimmick is that almost every sentence is structured as a variation on the basic line, "boys enter the house." But within a few short pages, Moody hurtles from boys entering the house crying to their mommy to boys entering the house to prepare for weddings of childhood friends, like a flipped-through photo album, pausing to take in the more vivid shots. And so, though these boys obviously grow up and change, the story's brevity and the repetition of that phrase -- "boys enter the house" -- suggest with great poignancy that  these are the same boys , even when they're adults. As with  Eternal Sunshine , time is compressed. We see them at every age at once.   Oddly enough, both  urlLink Charlie Kaufman  and Rick Moody have reputations for being, as the British say, too clever by half. Their reliance on gimmicks and smarty-pants irony, it's said, masks an inability to tell a good, emotionally driven story. With Moody, I'm inclined to agree to some extent, as some of his riskier experiments do seem indulgent and impenetrable. (I've never had issue with Kaufman because his films are always nothing if not tremendously entertaining.) But regardless of where you stand, these two works are powerful exceptions.

      A week or two ago, I noticed that  urlLink Scott M. , who I haven't seen in months, said something on his  urlLink Friendster  profile about winning some Beach Boys albums on  urlLink eBay . I asked him which ones, which led to a nice little back-and-forth. Originally, I was waiting to post this until I could edit it, but fuck that. It's fine how it is. (And Scott's given me permission.)  SCOTT:  I believe I won every single album leading up to Beach Boys Today!  ?  I'm a fucking Beach Boys geek, John....so I'm going to go off on a tangent right now.  :)  Hopefully, you're a BB geek as well.  So few people I know can handle them, so I get excited when friends express any sort of interest in the music of Wilson.  It's all your fault!    I have a lot of Beach Boys on CD (and a decent version of Smile).  Owning the early material on vinyl, however, is really a treat to the ear.  There were some live albums in my group auction, and every studio album that lead up to their more avante garde pop, which began in late 1964.  This was sort of the last little purchase for my Brian Wilson collection.  I now have everything that I originally wanted either on record or CD....basically, his work from '61 to '67.  That's all one really needs.          Wilson started to think in classical music right around the time "Beach Boys Today!" was created in 1964.  That period is still very "California" in lyrical content....so it makes for a very odd juxtaposition when placed with such deep music.  The album "Summer Days/Summer Nights" is Part II to that type of thought process, and also the warning for "Pet Sounds".  Orchestration and melody are perfect around this time.  His music is so avante garde, sophisticated, yet beautiful in 1964-65, but you still have Mike Love's shallow lyrics on top.  This factor is fascinating to me. Historically, it's interesting because it's the beginning of awareness and psychadelia in 60s America, and the country was split (much like it is now).  The Beach Boys themselves, were artistically split.  This is why Wilson ditched Love to work with other collaborators on Pet Sounds and Smile.  All of this Beach Boys stuff is very relevant to what goes on now.  Aware America vs. Blind Square America.  Color vs. Black and White.  It's quite ironic that the "smile project" might actually be officially released this year in our music industry.     I've been kind of obsessed with this man for awhile.  I've always loved his sound since I was a kid, and fell in love with Pet Sounds during high school.  I had always heard about Smile, but wasn't taking the innitiative to seek it out because I hadn't done enough research on it yet.  I heard it for the first time last summer, and a lot of it blew my mind.      Maybe I should have a Beach Boys party this spring to celebrate the warm weather, and my new apartment.    Thanks for letting me go off on a tangent.  If you're ever interested in copying my CDs or records, feel free.  Maybe you already have all that shit.    Take care.  See you soon.  Scott   JOHN: Awesome. I really get excited when I hear people are into the Beach Boys, too. I met a guy at the Empty Bottle recently, a friend of Sara M.'s, and found out he was a Brian Wilson fan, so we ended up talking for a while; I think we annoyed Jon M., who kept looking over and finding we were *still* talking about a band he had nothing to say about!  Anyway, I'd never really taken the Beach Boys seriously until a few years ago. I mean, I'd heard all the early 60s hits on oldies radio, and "Good Vibrations" and all that. But it wasn't until early 2001, when a co-worker let me borrow a CD of "Smile" tracks (I think it's maybe the stuff from the 1993 "Good Vibrations" box set?) and I fucking loved it that I became really impressed and curious about the band. Based on my reaction, said co-worker bought me "Today! / Summer Days/Summer Nights" for my birthday. And then not long thereafter, I bought "Pet Sounds." On those three albums, which are like 1965-66, there's definitely some great stuff, but I'm especially partial to the bits that anticipate "Smile" -- like the instrumental "Pet Sounds" (which is similar to any of the instrumental "Heroes and Villains" sections) or "Caroline, No" (which has the same intimate melancholy of "Surf's Up").   Oh, so I forgot to mention that on the same CD with the "Smile" material that my co-worker lent me, there were also a few highlights from 1968-71, some really killer singles that maybe sound a little cheesy at first but are actually incredible. (And I love stuff that's cheesy, anyway.) And so just a month ago, I went and bought "Friends / 20/20," which collects their 1968-69 albums. There's sort of this myth that after "Smile," Brian Wilson just went off into his sandbox for like 20 years. Which totally isn't true. I mean, he was no longer in a position to take as much creative control of the band, but he was still involved. And some of the other Beach Boys started writing really cool shit, too. Dennis Wilson has a song on "Friends" called "Little Bird," which is only two minutes long but takes a really interesting arc, from this Turtles-ish verse to a more jaunty harmonized chorus that fades out. And cello!   The other interesting thing about the albums after "Smile" and through "Surf's Up" (1971) is that there's reworkings of aborted "Smile" recordings -- sometimes good, sometimes bad (the version of "Vegetables" on "Smiley Smile" (1967) is terrible, in my opinion, but "Cabinessence," on "20/20," sounds really close to what's on the "Smile" bootlegs).   Also, you might be interested in the Van Dyke Parks solo album, "Song Cycle," which I own. It's kind of hard to get into -- the lyrics are really obtuse, and the melodies are really weird, too. And it sounds like a turn-of-the-century revue sometimes. But as part of the entire Beach Boys experience, it's interesting.   I'd love it if you had a Brian Wilson party :)  john   SCOTT:  John.  You made my day.  I am so glad that you are as big a fan of the Beach Boys as I am.  I've been converting people very slowly, but it doesn't usually end up too well.  It's wierd.  The Beatles are great, but I've never felt the need to "convert" people to that band.  Maybe I figured there were people who liked them, and people who did not.  The Beatles are just played all the time, over and over again.  With the Beach Boys, however, I feel like it's our duty to show our generation their relevance.  Most people we know have not had the opportunity to hear the broad range of Wilson and Co., and their incredible development.  It has just been their early hits played over and over again, and maybe Good Vibrations played every once in awhile on the radio.  Mike Love continues to hammer home the image of fun fun fun!, patriotic, and those masogynistic lyrics into the hearts of newer generations of people every year, so no wonder this is the situation.       I almost have my boyfriend converted to "fan status", but he is a critical theorist, so he will be my toughest patient.  :)  I made him a copy of Pet Sounds, and he laughed at the lyrics and music immediately.  Then I played some of the more obscure tracks like "Pet Sounds", and "Here Today" (which scares the shit out of me still).  He got a little more intrigued, and stopped laughing.  THen.....a few weeks later, I played him "Wind Chimes", "Fire", and "Surf's Up",.....and his reaction was:    "This reminds me of Mark Rothko's final paintings."  Interesting reaction, indeed.  When I heard "Surf's Up", my mind was blown.  I cried, John.  It was there and then when I realized Brian Wilson was in a category that was beyond even pop music.  It's an amazing piece of work, obviously, and the perfect example of his collaboration with Van Dyke Parks.  They reached their peak with that song.  It's one of the greatest pieces of American music....ever.             So many people are too judgemental of artists because their "image" doesn't live up to their hip standards.  They freak out when lyrics are simple, trite, and expressing something naive.  They don't look at the "big picture" surrounding the development of the artist.  I don't take a whole lot of the early Beach Boys' records seriously either, but you and I are on the same wavelength where we can look at the band objectively....as capable of making extremely well-thought out music.  Simple.  And some of those early songs are great (Don't Worry  Baby!).      Completely agree with you on post-Smile period of the group.  Brian Wilson just stepped down from his duties as cheif conductor/producer/composer.  I've read enough to realize (and empathize) that he wasn't insane, but rather depressed and probably very beaten down artistically by the music industry, other group members, and maybe partying too much.  From what I understand, he never stopped composing the entire duration of his reclusive period, but never bothered to record his songs either.  There was just no desire to release them anymore to the market.  Music was made for his enjoyment only during that period.  The man was very smart though.  Just incredibly eccentric.      I love the "square" vibe they were working for during that already vacuous decade called the 70s.  I own Carpenters records, for god sakes!  Part of me might not necessarily like the material, but carry more of a sick fascination with perfect pop production values, and knowing the real story behind the music.  Maybe I appreciate the fact that they were still attempting to make something beautiful amidst a horrendous cycle of events (Wilson's retreat, Capital records screwing them over, and Dennis' Manson Family affiliations, etc.).  If I was alive during that time period, I probably would not have liked this type of stuff.  Now, I look at it with a fascination, a critical eye, and appreciation that it's just great pop music made during a time when people were growing their hair out, doing cocaine, and recording half-hour guitar solos.  The Beach Boys never lost the notion of a "song", or "composition".  Virtuosity was such a late 60s-early 70s thing, and they avoided that always.  That's why people thought they were square during the 70s.      Sorry for keeping this discussion going, but it's just too fun.  Thank you though.  I don't feel so alone now.  I am totally having my Beach Party now.  We'll pull out the Smile tracks and frighten the non-believers!  :)  Cheers, John.  I'll see you soon.  Good luck with the shows you have coming up.

       My very own entry in the Jay-Z remix sweepstakes   I'm a complete novice at this, and my software (Apple's GarageBand) is hardly advanced (there's no way to change pitch, so I had to find a sample in the same key as the chorus!), but I'm fairly proud of what I was able to throw together. A generic GarageBand beat provides the foundation for a mash of the vocals from "Change Clothes" and a chopped-and-spliced string sample from Stereolab's "Cybele's Reverie".  urlLink Enjoy.

      I'm not sure how I missed Eppy's  urlLink clap clap blog  until now -- he seems to be connected to all the right folks -- but I'm really impressed with the last two months of posts I've read.  urlLink Here’s  a great post that encapsulates much of what I’ve been feeling about politics for the last year or so (at least since the Iraq imbroglio began). And then  urlLink this gem , about the Built to Spill song, "Carry the Zero" -- which I like not just because he recognizes that it's far and away the best song on  Keep It Like a Secret , but because the entire post (all  thirteen  paragraphs!) is a strictly musical (i.e., not lyrical) exegesis of the tune. It’s a little too theory-heavy in a couple of places, which is always the danger of an approach like this, as it tends to alienate non-musicians -- but not enough critics are even attempting to write about how music actually sounds and what goes into it that it's ultimately a small complaint.

       urlLink  Azita, "On the Road" (from  Enantiodromia , Drag City, 2003)    So Azita Youssefi used to be in a couple of punk/no-wave bands, the Scissor Girls and Bride of No-No, but now performs as a lounge piano act that's been compared most frequently to the deliciously slick Steely Dan. Which is pretty much all you had to say to get me interested. As it turns out, though, I first came across Azita, as with her labelmate Joanna Newsom, in a live context -- opening for the comedian Todd Barry. And she didn't quite hit me right away. Her songs seemed to meander, and she had a peculiar way of overnunciating every word in her husky voice, swallowing all the Ls on the line "WELL, I think that I will GOOOOWW" ("Wasn’t in the Bargain")[1]. But this was still fairly compelling, in its own way, and so when I heard later that my friend Eric Z. liked her, I dashed off an e-mail: "How can you get past the voice??"  Eric wrote back: “Well, yeah, she even sometimes strains for high notes she can't hit, but then again, so does Neil Young on  Tonight's the Night  and that's one of my favorite albums ever." Not to mention there was something sticky about those sprightly, tangled piano lines, packed with jazz chords. And so it took a little while but I fell for her.  Enantiodromia [2] is ultimately an inconsistent album -- there are two nice Satie-like instrumentals that nevertheless feel out of place -- but when Azita fires on a song like "On the Road," with a melody that slips and jumps around and catapults into a fantastic solo break, you really don't mind the voice. In fact, it kind of grows on you.[3]  [1] I especially like Sonia Pereira's  urlLink  description  of Azita’s voice as "cavernous, like a mermaid singing from the depths."  [2] Her first album, which I picked up instead of the newer  Life on the Fly  (with its  urlLink  Countdown to Ecstasy -aping cover ) only because it was used.   [3] Although I had a somewhat worrying thought recently when I realized that the voices of both Azita and Joanna Newsom were not only "unconventional" but blatant and unrestrained, in a way that wasn’t so different  from certain untrained "outsider" musicians like, say,  urlLink BJ Snowden . (And for that matter, isn't it weird how preoccupied Newsom is with all that old-timey shit?!)

      At some point recently, I realized that the two contemporary musicians with whom I’ve been obsessed this year, and the performers of the two classic 1970s songs I’ve kept on repeat in the last couple of months, have all been women. Which isn’t an alarming insight or anything (OMG, what does that say about me?!), but the fact that I noticed a common thread at all made me think that it was time, perhaps, to post here again. (The downtime at work helps, too.)  So here we go: the first installment of Women We Love, Spring 2004 Edition. (More to come soon, I promise.)     urlLink Joanna Newsom, “Bridges and Balloons”  (from  The Milk-Eyed Mender , Drag City, 2004)   So I’m waiting for Will Oldham, who I don’t even like all that much ( I See a Darkness  is the only Bonnie “Prince” Billy record that doesn’t bore me) but whose stark Southern-gothic shtick, coupled with the small gallery space we’re in, holds the promise for an unusually intimate show. Which would be nice. I know nothing about his opener, Joanna Newsom, but when this girlish woman in a peasant dress takes the stage, smiles nervously, and props up her harp (!), I’m breathless for the next forty minutes. Part of it’s the novelty of the harp, sure, as I can’t keep my eyes off her intricate finger work; she picks higher notes like a guitar and plucks lower ones like an upright bass, all at once. Part of it’s that I’m a fool for the sound of finger-picking, period: close your eyes and it’s just as abstract and trancelike as the best minimalist composition. (I’m amazed, sometimes, at how I hate so much folk music in the three-chords-strummed tradition but love similar stuff when it’s finger-picked. The outright jazz flourishes on some of Newsom’s songs don’t hurt, either.) A lot of it, though, is Newsom’s delivery. Like a child, she murmurs one moment and shouts the next; her voice doesn’t have much depth, but when it spills out, it’s unabashedly generous and heartfelt. There’s something quite precious about all this, of course, and I haven’t even mentioned lyrics like “a thimblesworth of milky moon” or song titles like “Clam, Crab, Cockle, Cowrie.” But the sort of precocious literariness Newsom puts on display seems less a bid for cleverness (cf. every English major’s new favorite band, the Decemberists) and more an honest evocation of an interior world – especially when it belongs to a bright and dreamy young folkie from Nevada City, California. The line that gets me tonight, however, which I sing to myself for the next few days, is a simple one (albeit antiquated in its way), from the equally melancholy and hopeful “Bridges and Balloons”: “Oh my love, oh, it was a funny little thing.” Indeed. Oldham, by the way, ends up being mostly forgettable, but I’ve already experienced the intimate performance I sought, and startlingly so.

      Why I throw my hands up when it comes to politics much too often:  "I think the modern man or woman is really left to just look at all the pundits and see who has the most consistent and plausible argument. We're not able to choose between truth and falsity most of the time, so we just have to choose that which is promulgated by people we 'trust' and who are presenting a position which corresponds to some of our values -- internal consistency, fruitfulness, harmony with other beliefs that we have, and some kind of correspondence to what we think the facts are (with the realization that our access to those 'facts' is mediated by previous decisions just like this one)."   -- urlLink Jonathan Barlow ,  urlLink responding  to a post at  urlLink kottke.org .   (This post prompted by a Friendster bulletin I just received letting me know that  Fahrenheit 9/11  is "dishearteningly clear about who's in control and who's not." I wish I felt that kind of certainty sometimes.)

      Recent jukebox selections:   May 22, Lucky Strike Bowling Alley   Curtis Mayfield, "Move On Up" (and when this started up in the nearly empty room mid-afternoon, it was loud! and so long!)  Wilco, "Box Full of Letters" (because certain people at the party liked Wilco, and because  urlLink I like reminding myself  that the band was once, before the words "avant-pop masterpiece" were ever used, a solid country-rock band)   The Smiths, "How Soon is Now" (?) (is this what precipitated the conversation I had re: that new, kinda silly Morrissey album?)   June 11, Cody's    I don't totally remember, because the songs were never actually played when I was there. What I do remember is that it struck me as one of the best goddamn jukeboxes I'd seen: an incredible balance of all your standard rock-canon selections (including old soul and old country), aging alt-rocker faves (The Pixies, R.E.M.), contemporary indie-rock (The Shins, Interpol), and current mainstream pop (Justin Timberlake, 50 Cent). Which is about all you can ask for, really. And so the only song I absolutely remember selecting was "Mary Jane's Last Dance," because I told someone and they said, "You go on about what a great jukebox it is, but then you pick Tom Petty?" (See above comment re: country-rock.)   June 18, Delilah's   The RAWKest jukebox I've come across. (And let me make this clear, I'm hardly a jukebox pro. It's only been recently that I've begun to really acquaint myself with them. So if you know where to find some good ones in Chicago, let me know!)   Television, "See No Evil"  The Cure, "Boys Don't Cry" (both of the above on the  urlLink amazing-looking  4CD  No Thanks! The 70s Punk Rebellion  set)  The Runaways, "Cherry Bomb" (and this one, too, had I noticed; technically, though, I took it from the original 1976 self-titled album)

      I'm not really the public-advocacy type, but I've often thought that if I were to advocate anything, it would be the enhancement of library music collections. Yeah, I know, not quite on the same level as voter disenfranchisement or genetically modified food -- but anyone who's combed through the racks of CDs at their local library knows that it's more often than not a sorry sight. Whereas librarians seem to purchase books with certain criteria in mind -- bestseller status, critical reputation, patron interest -- you get the impression that a large portion of the music on the shelves is  urlLink donated , making it no better than the $1.99 overstock boxes at the used record store, or even the Salvation Army, for that matter. (Why else was I, as a suburban 15-year-old just getting interested in indie rock, able to find the debut album by a minor band like The Dambuilders, who would disappear within a few years, and yet nothing at all by Liz Phair or Pavement or PJ Harvey, all of whom showed up  twice  in the  urlLink Pazz & Jop  top 10 from 1992–94?)    Part of the reason my concern may sound silly is because things have been bad for so long, library patrons have hardly any expectations when it comes to music. "It's a  library , after all: from the Latin  librarius , meaning 'of books.'" But since I'm of the opinion that a free musical education is just as valuable as a free literary education, the disparity in attention troubles me. I mean, why even go through the motions of keeping up a record collection if you're not going to make it worthwhile?     Now, I don't expect that my local library is going to stock all the latest Pitchfork-approved indie releases (although if anyone's trying, it's probably  urlLink people like this ). What I do expect is an attempt to offer a wide range of significant, well-respected albums in music history – in other words, an adherence to a canon (while understanding, of course, that canons are always flexible).     In order to see how my library (the vast  urlLink Chicago Public Library  system) fared at meeting this not-very-rigorous standard, I used what I figured was as good a list as any: the  Rolling Stone   urlLink 500 Greatest Albums Ever Made  survey that came out late last year. As an accurate summation of the best in recorded music, this list has its  urlLink fair share of problems , most having to do with its annoyingly rockist tendencies ("it's all about the 60s, maaan"). But for our purposes, the poll's emphasis on the overly enshrined, as well as its attempt at populism (musicians and industry figures voted alongside critics, those pesky elevators of the obscure), mean that it should contain exactly the kind of records you'd expect to find at a library.    As for the results? Well, I have to admit, I was surprised to find that the Chicago Public Library owns 76 of the top 100 albums of all time on compact disc. It owns another 15 on vinyl or cassette -- although I thought this figure was worth separating out, inasmuch as this collection isn't much use to the majority of music listeners in 2004, especially young people, for whom a collection of free music would seem to be the most beneficial. And there are nine albums in the top 100 that the library does not own at all.    I was surprised because I assumed, before I looked at the  Rolling Stone  list, that the figure would be more like 50% rather than 75%. So the situation was not as bleak as I thought. But let's look at those 24 albums the library doesn't own in the standard compact-disc format:    *available on vinyl  **available on vinyl and cassette    30. Joni Mitchell,  Blue *  33. Ramones,  Ramones   38. Muddy Waters,  Anthology 1947-1972   40. Love,  Forever Changes **  44. Patti Smith,  Horses   45. The Band,  The Band *  50. Little Richard,  Here's Little Richard *  53. Ray Charles,  The Birth of Soul   55. Elvis Presley,  Elvis Presley   58. Captain Beefheart,  Trout Mask Replica *  59. The Beatles,  Meet the Beatles! **  60. Sly and the Family Stone,  Greatest Hits *  61. Guns N Roses,  Appetite for Destruction *  71. Neil Young,  After the Gold Rush *  74. Otis Redding,  Otis Blue   77. The Clash,  The Clash **  80. The Zombies,  Odessey &amp; Oracle   82. The Jimi Hendrix Experience,  Axis: Bold as Love *  83. Aretha Franklin,  I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You *  84. Aretha Franklin,  Lady Soul *  92. Buddy Holly,  20 Golden Greats *  93. Prince,  Sign 'O' the Times   97. Bob Dylan,  The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan *  99. Sly and the Family Stone,  There's a Riot Going On     I don't begrudge the CPL for not owning the Muddy Waters and Ray Charles albums, both of which are anthologies that I doubt contain many songs not already on the dozens of Waters and Charles records the library does own.     But what about the Ramones debut album, which the  SPIN Alternative Record Guide  lists as the #1 alternative album of all time? What about Patti Smith's  Horses , one of the most influential albums for female rock musicians ever? What about  Sign 'O' the Times , anointed by critics as the  urlLink best record of 1987 , or the consensus-best albums by major stars like Otis Redding and Sly and the Family Stone? And what's the deal with keeping platinum sellers like  Blue ,  Appetite for Destruction , and  The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan  in a format inaccessible to most library patrons?     When you actually look at what's missing, it's a crime that a city of three million people doesn't in fact possess all of these albums.    As a means of comparison, I checked to see how many of the Modern Library's  urlLink 100 Best English-Language Novels of the 20th Century  showed up on CPL shelves. It's not a perfect analogue, of course. One could argue that the  Rolling Stone  list, by virtue of its editorial interests and readership, ends up being a list of the greatest  rock  albums ever made and therefore describes a niche market. And while that's not strictly true (Miles Davis and John Coltrane both appear in the top 50), the reason so many rock albums appear on the list is because rock music is, in fact, the dominant musical paradigm of the recorded-music era. Just as Richardson and Fielding perfected the novel as the preeminent long-form literary work, the Beatles are said to have been the first to treat the long-playing record as its own unique artistic form, and not just a way to group a handful of singles.    Anyway, the number of books on the Modern Library top 100 list that the CPL owns? 100.

      THIS ONE'S FOR THE COMIX FANS    Isn't there something similar about the friendship dynamic between Andy and Louie in  urlLink  Eightball  #23 , and that between Scotty and Alex in  urlLink  Optic Nerve  #8 ? It's an interesting dynamic: Louie and Alex are both take-charge, peer-pressuring kids (the former with cigarettes, the latter with porn) who are nonetheless just as uncool as their quieter buddies (actually, probably more so, since they're less invisible about it). You can imagine them befriending these smaller, scrawnier boys because, after being bullied at school and ignored at home, it's the only means for them to assert control over someone. And once you come to this realization, the whole thing becomes unbearably sad.  Optic Nerve  probably handles this character work better ( urlLink with an amazing feel for 1991 fashion! ), but I've admired Clowes's formal experimentation lately: telling the story from different angles, piecing together what's left. (Another beneficiary of this kind of shards-of-glass approach, in the traditional literary world: Bram Stoker's  Dracula .)

      So Eppy had  urlLink the idea  of posting 100 songs off the top of his head, a random playlist from the iPod ... in his mind, and it was admittedly self-indulgent but also easy and funny and so here goes:  1. "Ring of Fire," Johnny Cash (Quick, something historical!) 2. "I Will Always Love You," Whitney Houston  3. "588-2300," The Empire Carpet Commercial Choir 4. "Kamera," Wilco 5. That Shania Twain song that's only just shimmering in my subconscious, not quite reeled in. "Don't Impress Me Much." That's it. I think I've only heard it once, but apparently it was a huge hit. Did you know whatever album that's on is the  urlLink biggest-selling album  for a solo female artist? 6. "Sometimes Love Just Ain't Enough," Patty Smythe (the one who's not cool, right?) 7. "The Boys of Summer," Don Henley (which you can't really think of anymore without thinking of the 8. Ataris cover version (which changed the Deadhead sticker to a Black Flag sticker), and  I've  never been able to think of without thinking of the  9.  urlLink Steve Dahl  parody "The Boys of Zimmer," about the  urlLink 1989 Chicago Cubs , which contained the classic line, " urlLink Jerome Walton , with your jewelry shinin' in the sun." 10. "That's What Friends Are For," Dionne Warwick & Friends (to be sung at Junior Miss competitions and the last Brownie meeting of the year) 11. "Linus & Lucy," Vince Guaraldi 12. "Mannheim Steamcleaner," C0lin Sheaff (Does it count if it's a solo piano piece that exists solely as a shitty mp3 recorded at band practice once?) 13. "Born in the USA," Bruce Springsteen  14. "Jump," Van Halen (I'm interested in the moment where both Van Halen and The Boss decided, "Guys, it's the eighties, we really need some flute-like synths or else we'll totally be left behind.") 15. "Bad," Michael Jackson 16. "I Love You," Barney (Man, his time really came and went, huh?) 17. "Girls Girls Girls," Motley Crue (Sunday night was all about playing cards and drinking Corona and listening to various heavy-metal best-ofs. The Poison collection was pretty sweet, too.) 18. "Strawberry Letter 23," Tevin Campbell (I'm not gonna pretend I'm hip and say the Shuggie Otis version, which I've never heard; I liked to listen to the Tevin Campbell version in my room while the Barcelona Olympics coverage was on some sport I didn't care about. Fun fact: Tevin Campbell once guest-starred on  The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air .) 19. "Fresh Prince of Bel-Air (Theme Song)," DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince. (Really, one of the all-time greats.) 20. "Brand New Life ('Who's the Boss Theme' Song)." (What the hell? This, I just discovered, was co-written by  urlLink Larry Carlton , the cheeseball jazz guitarist who nevertheless contributed some nice licks to  21. Joni Mitchell's "Help Me" and  22. Steely Dan's "Kid Charlemagne"? Why?) 23. "The Monster Mash" (Hey, man, it was a graveyard smash.) 24. "Fire Water Burn," Bloodhound Gang. (As featured in  Fahrenheit 9/11 ) 25. "Puttin' on the Ritz," that old-time song. (Isn't there a song by this name by the 80s band Taco? Is it the same song?) 26. "Hello," Lionel Richie 27. "Ain't No Mountain High Enough" (Who is this? Aretha?) 28. "G.I. Joe (Theme Song)" 29. "Nomads," High Llamas 30. "Take On Me," A-ha 31. "I'm Every Woman," Whitney Houston (I have some vague recollection of myself in 13-year-old critic mode, hyping this song for its Patti Labelle-like qualities, and especially in contrast to the immensely popular #2.) 32. "The District Sleeps Alone Tonight," The Postal Service (I figured this one on keyboard a few days ago; it's all about the fat synth-bass.) 33. "U Can't Touch This," M.C. Hammer (It's strange how most of these songs so far have been back-in-the-day HITS, rather than new tunes I've been grooving to.) 34. (and yet) "Life on the Fly," Azita 35. "Bootylicious," Destiny's Child 36. "Take a Chance on Me," ABBA (but maybe the Erasure version, which is what I heard first; all the seniors in my high-school production of  Midsummer Night's Dream  seemed to like that one) 37. "Change Clothes," Jay-Z 38. "Birdhouse in Your Soul," They Might Be Giants 39. "Til I Hear It From You," Gin Blossoms (Jesus. Another shimmering-in-the-back-of-my mind sort of song. I just had a lyrical snippet: "I don't wanna take advice..." Except I thought the advice was "from friends," rather than "from fools." Thank you, Google.) 40. "Puff the Magic Dragon" 41. "Stella Was a Diver and She Was Always Down," Interpol 42. "Emerge," Fischerspooner 43. "Ready 2 Wear," Felix Da Housecat 44. a song on  urlLink the new Animal Collective album  I can't remember the title of, one of the more overtly Beach Boys-ish cuts 45. "The Angels Want to Wear My Red Shoes," Elvis Costello 46. "Gotta Get a Record Out," Green (I've been wondering lately whether I can say I've been in this band, when all I did was play three or four live shows with them in 2001; I probably wouldn't care if they weren't so  urlLink legendary .) 47. "There is a Light That Never Goes Out," The Smiths 48. "More Than Words Can Say," Extreme 49. "Notre Dame Fight Song" (the music of which also doubled as  urlLink my high-school fight song ) 50. "Take Me Home, Country Roads," John Denver (one of the many songs I learned through the Reader's Digest collections of sheet music) 51. "Brother Can You Spare a Dime" was another one, learned in 6th grade on a cheap Yamaha keyboard 52. "Tender," Blur 53. "Every Day is Like Sunday," Morrissey 54. "Summer in the City," The Lovin' Spoonful 55. "Clementine," traditional ("oh my darlin'") 56. "Phone Call," Jon Brion (from the  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind  soundtrack: spot the mental segue!) 57. "Gin and Juice," Snoop Doggy Dogg 58. "Mairzy Doats" (I mean,  urlLink a kid'll eat ivy, too ; wouldn't you?) 59. "Baby Britain," Elliott Smith (man, I love those a-chord-every-beat songs like  60. "Everything Hits at Once," Spoon, or  61. "God Only Knows," Beach Boys. 62. "Frere Jacques," traditional 63. "The Cat Came Back," traditional, I guess (and why this song? because a cat's sitting right next to me right now) 64. "Stray Cat Strut," The Stray Cats 65. "Sing! Sing! Sing!," Benny Goodman (which often calls to mind a scene in Woody Allen's  Manhattan Murder Mystery ) 66. "Carnival," Natalie Merchant (one of many songs I associate with driving to work for my first-ever job, at an insurance office, in 1995; I'd take these back roads with the A/C cranked, and I'd listen to WXRT and hear, like, 67. "Hold Me Thrill Me Kiss Me," U2, or 68. "You Oughta Know," Alanis Morrissette (oh man, I'd also tape episodes of  urlLink Sound Opinions  with Jim DeRogatis and Bill Wyman, and listen to them in the car, on a portable cassette recorder, since my car never had a tape player, and the theme song to  Sound Opinions  incorporated an excerpt of 69. "Little Fluffy Clouds," The Orb [which I downloaded the other day, along with probably my two favorite late 90s drum and bass cuts {not that I've ever had a whole lot to choose from, you know, considering I'm not an expert}: 70. "Brown Paper Bag," Roni Size, and 71. "Circles," Adam F]) 72. "Ghost Ship in a Storm," Jim O'Rourke 73. "Showrooms," Sam Prekop 74. TJ Maxx commercial jingle ("You get the max for the minimum, the minimum price.") 75. "When I'm 64," Beatles (because Ringo turned 64 last week) 76. "You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling" 77. "Stayin' Alive," The Bee Gees 78. That Komeda song that begins, "There's a place where we can go if we want to have fun." 79. "Just a Star,"  urlLink Canasta  80. "Jenny (867-5309)," Tommy Tutone 81. "Turning Japanese," The Vapors 82. That little piece of faux-Orientalism at the beginning of "Turning Japanese," but also whenever anyone wants to signify "the Orient": you know, it's like G-G-G-G-F-F-D-D-F, and then a gong hits?  83. (I love these kinds of musical cues: sit down at a piano and play C-D-E-F#-G#-A# and then back down again and up again as fast as you can, and tell me you don't feel like you're in a flashback or dream sequence.) 84. "Conduit for Sale!," Pavement 85. "Zurich is Stained," Pavement 86. "I Know What Boys Like," The Waitresses (I should learn to stop buying cassettes, even when they're 99 cents at the thrift store; I own this album, but I never listen to it,  because it's on cassette ) 87. "Video Killed the Radio Star," The Buggles 88. "Sugar Mountain," Neil Young 89. "My Sharona," The Knack (what the fuck, my brain is cycling through a Rhino Records new-wave comp) 90. "California," Joni Mitchell 91. "California," Rufus Wainwright (not a cover) 92. "Crazy Mary," Pearl Jam 93. "99 Bottle of Beer on the Wall" 94. "She'll Be Comin' Round the Mountain (When She Comes)" 95. "Push It," Salt N Pepa 96. "Oh Yeah," Yello (I've always sort of associated these last two songs. I bet someone could do a wicked mash-up of them.) 97. "Night and Day," written by Cole Porter (no specific performer in mind) 98. "Paradise City," Guns N Roses 99. "The Reason," Hoobastank 100. "Low Rider," War

      REAL-TIME RECORD REVIEWS, #1: Phoenix,  Alphabetical  (Source/Astralwerks, 2004)  0. I talked to my dad last night, and even he was bemoaning my diminished posting in the last few months (esp. in contrast to my brother's brilliant  urlLink new art blog ), so I thought I'd try something I've done a few times before, pre- Seaworthy . The idea is to write about an album in the time it takes to actually listen to it. Each number represents the track that's playing, though I probably won't write about every single track. Anyway, I'm choosing this new Phoenix record because a) I haven't mentioned it here yet, b) it's easily in my top 5 of 2004 so far, and c) the U.S. release is exactly two weeks away. You should buy it. I'm going to do my part.   1. Is it just me, or does "Everything is Everything" sort of sound like Justin Timberlake's "Like I Love You": those dark, syncopated acoustic guitar strums, a hip-hop/dance beat, a high, not-quite-thin, sexy male vocal? Man, it's just so explosive from the start. It's my favorite non-radio single of the year.  2. I read the official press release on  Alphabetical , and it talked about "Run Run Run" as a blend of folksy guitar (was there a Beck reference, maybe?) and Dr. Dre production*. I don't think I realized until that moment the debt that a band like Phoenix owes to hip-hop, specifically, instead of just electronic music. Here's a good place to also make the comparison to Air. Both are French duos** who often sing in English, are interested in pastiche, slick production, and retro styles ...  3. ... and their new albums both have songs with choruses that go "Run, run, run." (The Air tune is just called "Run.") But although  Talkie Walkie  is pleasant and downright pretty in parts,  Alphabetical  packs more of an overall punch. Which means I don't even listen to the Air record anymore.  4. About half the time I hear the top of "Love for Granted," the finger-picking and plaintive vocals remind me of Archer Prewitt, of all people! There's something about Mr. Phoenix's voice that has that kind of blankness I tend to like in music. A voice that takes the unwavering tone of an instrument. Except later on in this cut, he gives a pleasing little "huh!" And the production -- the cooing background vocals, that slowly rocking piano -- really elevate this from its mellowness.  5. It just occurred to me that the voice is not dissimilar to Markus Acher's, and I don't know if the fact that neither is a native English speaker is any kind of coincidence. What I love about Phoenix, though, is that unlike bands like Air and The Notwist, who seem like contemporaries ...  6. ... there's just so much more of an overt pop sheen. Pop as in something you could hear on the radio, in the club. Maybe it's in the rhythm: more insistent beats, a fluid bassline, and maybe just more complexity: shakers, a back-and-forth marimba.  7. Hmmm. I don't know if I realized this ("Congratulations") was a separate track, rather than an outro to the previous track. It's nice.   8. The first Phoenix song I ever heard was "Too Young," because it was on the  Lost in Translation  soundtrack and it sounded like some forgotten 80s gem. Like, when I drove around with some college kids back in February, and it was snowing and we blared "Take on Me" out the car stereo, it could just as easily have been "Too Young."  Alphabetical  is a more consistent album than  United  (where "Too Young" first appeared), but "Too Young" is still their best song.  9. So do I address this retro fetishism? Dominique Leone's  urlLink Pitchfork review  of the album makes reference to 1980s adult contemporary, even, stuff like Hall & Oates and Fleetwood Mac, and almost as a caveat: "If you have a serious problem with that kind of cheesy stuff..." (and a tasty little windchime just swept across my headphones just now) "...then you'd be best off avoiding this record." Leone doesn't have a problem, but he still only gives it a 6.7. As for me, I've been stuck lately between deliberately embracing the side of myself that totally digs on ...  10. ... ridiculous lounge sounds and maybe still being a little embarrassed about it. Like, I bought Donald Fagen's  The Nightfly  a few weeks ago, and though I'll totally rep for individual cuts like "The Goodbye Look" and "New Frontier," there's no mistaking that the whole thing is a fucking smooth jazz record. (If "New Frontier" sounded familiar to me, it's because I likely heard it on WNUA ["ninety-five point FI-ive"] growing up.) And so am I okay with that? I mean, I don't want to outright dismiss any genre (and actually, I also heard Sade on WNUA, and I'll be damned if "Kiss of Life" isn't a fantastic single), but I also don't want to start buying, like, David Sanborn records, because that, my friend, is a lonely, lonely road.  *Almost. The press release on the  urlLink Phoenix site  refers to the song as "an unlikely collision between folk guitar and a pounding hip-hop beat," but it's a Norwegian publication that makes the  urlLink specific comparisons  to Beck and Dr. Dre.  **Nope. Phoenix is a four-piece. Can't say why I thought otherwise.
