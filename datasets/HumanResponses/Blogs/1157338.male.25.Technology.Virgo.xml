      Since my last post, i guess I should explain my love of H.R. Personnel, as it will make more sense for those who aren't in the know. To put it blunty I don't like H.R. people. Not the individual mind you, but the job. Really. Makes me vomit up bits of internal organs to even think about it. That said, here goes my spleen -      Before I go too far, let me re-verify my statement above, it's not the individual, it's the profession... I know programmers who love Visual Basic, I know people who prefer to eat their salads with salt and pepper, etc. Short explanation - even good people do bad things. It's in our nature. However, I cannot understand the inherent evil that is the HR job.  Now more specifically, I really really dislike the recruiters.  The avg HR joe who takes my call about a question on insurance, dental plans, etc is doing just fine in my book. They serve a need and they do it the way they think best. Fine. But those smug faced, lie spewing recruiter types, well, damn.  If you ever go to a career fair, you'll be surrounded by them, if you go to a college-style interview, you'll meet them. Some companies make you go to meetings filled with them. if you haven't met these types, count yourself lucky, and to try to help you spot them, I've written up some quick tell-tale signs :  Do they smile ALL THE TIME?  I mean, the kind of smile that looks like it was created by having the muscle fiber in their face altered, or maybe it's one of those freaky clear plastic masks, whatever, it's the first warning sign.  Do they talk really loud? are they exuding energy from their very pores? if so, another warning sign.      here's the worst one though - if someone is singing a company song, call it done. Same deal if there is a company chant, company dance, company sexual position, whatever. In fact, if the company has a song or a chant they do at meetings, might want to consider a job move.  I've had my fair share of experiences with the HR Demon. I've had to write a report saying i was sorry (3rd grade anyone?) I've had to do a fucking dance. I've had to watch them cheer and run across the stages telling everyone how wonerful their slave-style job was.  However, one occurence will always stay with me.  I saw one of the college recruiters walking out of work one day. I was slightly behind and to the side of her, so she did not notice me, but I had a good view of her profile. She seemed kinda off for some reason, like she was in a hurry to get out or something. Noticing this, I decided to see what was up.  That bitch wore her widest ass shit-eating grin the whole 1/2 mile walk through the parking lot to her car. She gets in, shuts the door, turns on her air-conditioning.... slumps way down in her seat and just relaxes her facial musclies.  It was the most amazing thing I'd ever seen. The smile gone, she put her blazer in gear and headed home.  I almost felt sorry for her until the next week when she made myself and some other guys play a "team-building exercise game"  Evil bitch

      OK, was talking to my boy Kaleb tonight, mentioned a recent career fair I'd been to here on campus, so here goes my take on it.  Career Fairs are pretty much bullshit. I say pretty much, cause every once in awhile, it has to do something for someone, or else why would people still go? maybe it's like an urban legend for the unemployed college student, like "I know this guy, who knew this guy who's roommates dog's groomer got a job through one". Anyways, so here was my experience at my most current Career Fair visit:  I go in, dressed down by typical attendee standards, but dressed up by typical ComSci guy standards (slacks and a sportscoat, no tie, if you cared).  I had my handful of resume's printed on the expensive, off-white paper that you're supposed to (who started that trend anyways? what difference does it really make over standard 20# paper? probably a paper manufacturer, greedy bastards).  So I go and decide to whore myself out for a job op.  Now if you've never been to one of these before, let me explain the setup to you: a really big open room, full of folding tables with big signs proclaiming the name of the company, and lots of free crap like pens and hats and stuff. There are usually 2-4 reps per company there to tell you how great the company is, and answer your questions. These are not the people you'd work with most of the time but H.R. people. My close friends know my feelings about H.R. people, but that's another story. So you go and say "Hi, I'm such and such, I'm pursuing my degree in such and such, and I'd like to work for your Company, or one of any company here who'll have me, I dont' really care". They say "great, let me see your resume" and then either "thanks, we'll keep this around" or "we probably don't have much for you right now, but I'll hold on to it just in case". Depending on your major they may just laugh you out and throw poo at you.  here's where it gets really annoying:  case 1 - myself - B.S. in CS GPA of 3.11 - currently seeking my M.S. IN CS with GPA of 4.0 - here were the two most common answers for me - "We can't recruit for anything but entry level positions here, and we couldnt' do that for you, too much experience" and "wow, this looks great, but we don't have any openings for IT people, and you're probably not Management type".  Wow.. neat... the first one really pisses me off, makes me think, you know, if your boss knew you passed up a willing experienced person who would work for entrylevel pay, would he fire you then or wait til your next performance eval?"  but this isn't as bad as:  case 2 - My sister - graduates this semester with her B.S. in history. ya, history, I know, no job right? but get this - she is a member of 4 different honor societies, has a 3.9 GPA and could rock your fucking socks off in just about any academic endeavor she wanted to. Most well read person I know, and a grand employee at the library. Now, I know she's not the salesmen type, but I'm sure that your company could find some sort of position that she can handle. Do you not have any clerks, analysts, or researchers at your company? Jeez. the worst part was, not only did she only get to hand over 1 resume, 4 people told her straight to her face to go away, or brushed her off. How great is that?  Since half these companies can't afford new blood, they were probably there to build goodwill... not a great way to go about that.  oh, and on our way out, I stopped by one last kiosk in hopes of gettign some kind of info - "we have intern positions for H.R. only" Christ.

      It just occured to me that the ending of my last post might confuse people - coffee and sleep... heh. I'm a hella huge caffeine addict. Get the shakes if I don't have the bean every day. Seriously. Feel Free to send me any caffeinated products you come across, they will be used with the speed of 1,000 irritated chihuahuas

      Hi, what a long day it's been for me. So I thought I'd come here and dump a brain-load on the web, maybe make me feel better. I think everyone has wondered what life would be like if we'd made different choices. This is not going to be a post about that. This is going to be a post about people who sit around waxing philosophical or political all the time.     Screw that. Who's got the time?     Why are we so damn whiny? It's like - look people, it doesn't matter, cause you DID make that choice, and that's it. You don't get to go back. So shut up already and do something useful. What I'm doing now is not useful, so I should beat myself up over it, but for some reason, I just don't wanna. so here goes:  1. - You can't change the past, forget about it. 2. - You are VERY unlikely to change peoples personal views and beliefs, no matter how much you argue, and what you say, unless that person is really searching for an answer and think you can give it to them. 3. - Opinions aren't right or wrong, don't get so uptight about it. 4. - No matter how many mean looks you get from teachers, peers, or anyone else, you should be able to speak your mind freely. 5. - The people who tend to preach Free Speech and Open Minds mean only theirs, not yours. remember that the next time you decide to promote Pro-Life, Anti-Drug, or any other "right wing-redneck-know nothing-bumpkin" viewpoint.  Just some thoughts. Read "The New Thought Police" by Tammy Bruce - it will make you think twice about the support the left wing gives to "free speech".  Startled me to see I agreed more with a Classic-Liberal Gun-owning Lesbian Journalist than with any politician I can think of.  I'm out - need coffee and sleep.

      OK, well the test post seems to have gone through, so I figure maybe I should introduce myself to my blog, and to whoever reads it, and maybe just in case I come up with amnesia, it'll help me out sometime.  Provided I can remember to view the blog of course.  My name is Phillip Martin, I live in Oklahoma (currently Stillwater).  Have a B.S. in Computer Science, working on my Master's degree after having been laid off by Worldcom back in June of 2002. I am married, wife's name is Shanna, we met back when I was a Sophomore, October of 1997. Got married in February of 2001 on the 10th. Send us anniversary presents if you'd like.  Graduate school is not totally my bag, having a time readjusting to school life, especially since most of my friends have graduated or gone. A few have come back, as I did, some just left after I got here, and others are just MIA.   It is weird how many people I still know here, and how little "College Life" has really changed overall. Frat guys and sorority girls still wear those damn T-Shirts. I can still spot the pseudo intellectuals from 3 latte's away, and of course, the afternoon-after partier, still reeking of stale beer and cigarettes while sitting next to you in the Student Union Foodcourt. The opinion writers in the school paper still write from a position showing a real lack of knowledge of the world beyond highschool/college (with the exception of maybe C. Brook Kurtz, who has apparently returned to OSU with me).  One thing that glares at me, is the absence of Preacher Bob (not his real name).  I miss that guy, was very entertaining.   Anywho - I'll get off the College hasn't changed and everyone's still stupid soapbox now. I'm hoping this will be an entertaining enough first post - and if not, go read my buddy Brian's post about his Critical Analysis class on his little blog over  urlLink  here    Later all

      OK Ok, happy posting time.  We had a few puppies about two weeks ago. We are now getting a few of them with opening eyes. Woot!  They're all very cute and cuddly.  I took them to Shanna's job tonight, so her co-workers and clients could see them.  Shanna works at a place called Stillwater Group Homes, they provide in-home health and life care for physically and mentally handicapped people.  Her clients are pretty severe, but their faces lit up when they saw our little furballs.  It was sweet, cute, and heartwarming. So there, I'm not such a negative fella eh?

      After reading my own words.. well wow.  I'm a negative son of a bitch. Maybe we could all use a little extra sunshine in our day. Perhaps I could be the one to give it to us all!!!    Well, sorry folks, I'm not that cheery.  However, I had an interesting conversation tonight and I think I'd like to share it with you. It isn't so much negative or positive, but I thought it was interesting, and if any of you wonder about how your Teachers and Teaching Assitants feel about classes, maybe it could give you some insight into their own thoughts and feelings.  I was up at my office this evening, grading a few papers, logging the grades and all that rot. Ya, did it on a Sunday evening, grades being distributed Monday. Graduate students forget that weekends exist, they're just the days we don't have to go to a class.   Regardless, a couple of other TA's were there, and also a TA who has recently been appointed to a lecturer position.  A big rumor has apparently started to come up in the department, seems we may not have enough financing to pay for all the TA's next semester, maybe not even enough for any of the Master's students to work at all. Being a MS student myself, this does indeed concern me. We all started talking about our alternatives. My head TA, a fellow who started the same time as me and who I think totally rocks, said that he'd heard of students who abandon their college and quit being TA's in the middle having a hard time returning to a program at said college.  He was afraid to go job hunting because of this, as it could require him to withdraw from the univeristy, and lose the good graces of the faculty.  At this point I began to wonder, "who cares?" I mean, if they can't support us to help them teach their classes (and I think a lot of you would be surprised by how much a TA really does for their students, especially in a technical discipline)  why should we bother to give up oppourtunity to make them happy? At this point I found the rift between myself and my associate. I did not come into the Master's program so that I could teach, I didn't come into it because of my great love for learning in a university setting. I did it for two reasons - financial asylum, and expanding my potential job oppourtunities.  He also came seeking these things, but would like to be a professor later in his life.  At this point - the person who is now a lecturer chimed in with "why I can't say that I know for sure that you'll be working next semester, it would still be a good idea to keep your prof's happy".  All of a sudden I wanted to scream.  you know, that warning lamp goes off in your head, your eyes cross, you get nauseated...  and I think. wait, he's a lecturer, working on his PhD, here so he can become a Prof.  Then it made sense and I calmed down a lot.  You see it boils down to what we're looking for. The lecturer needs his PhD.. that's all there is to it, he plan on becoming a Prof immediately.  The head TA - he wants to work, got laid off like I did, and would also like to be a prof (when he retires from industry he says). Myself, I just want the market to get better so I can go back to the life I had.   While we're all different on that, it makes sense, and we all know where we're at.  Here's where it got really neat though:  The lecturer mentioned how lucky we were to be TAing CS 1.  I immediately thought - what the hell are you talking about?  But the weird thing was that the Head TA agreed!  Now I had been complaining to a lot of my old buddies about CS 1.  It comes down to this:  They enjoy the challenge of getting people to learn something they dont' have the slightest understanding of.  I do not. I cannot stand the whining and complaining I get daily from the business students, the stat students, and everyone else. BUT I do enjoy teaching. I did it for free at my old high school while I was working at Worldcom. The difference  comes in that I like to teach those who are willing to learn.. who want it. because they don't complain that the material doesn't matter to them, that it is useless, and that they just want their C so they can go on. The people who want it are driven, or at least curious, and that makes all the difference.  What happens to us next semester? who the hell knows. What happens if we get job offers today, and are required to start next month? well, I for one would take it, tell my profs to kiss my ass, and go for it. I would love to complete it, and most likely would in my spare time.  The Head TA ? he'd be very conflicted. He's extremely loyal, likes the institution of higher learning, and wants to make sure he keeps the prof's happy. I told him to take the job, come back before he retires, all these profs will be dead or gone, and know one would be around to be mad that he'd left.  The lecturer? well he'll probably stay anyways, and since his Degree is being paid for, he doesn't have that much leverage.  One thing for everyone to remember please - TA's are students on top of your little helpers. They sometimes write your assignments, they almost always grade them, and they are severly underpaid. Don't blame them when you fail, don't make fun of them for looking weird (try sleeping avg of 3 hours per night from working instead of partying) and for the love of god, show them some resepect.  Out.

      well well well, I've been married for 2 years today. Neato.  thats the happy thought for today. Much too tired to keep that stuff up. Well, I've just finished the first round of tests for this semester, no matter what kind of college student you are, it feels good to be done with them. For me, it doesn't help that I have more work to do than a cheap whore during shore leave.  I have papers, programming projects, grading, and all manner of family obligations to attend to.  So why am I here writing? cause it's the easiest thing on the list to do.  Let me discuss this whole testing thing for a bit.  Lets get it straight - tests make up the majority of your grade. They are very short in length compared ot most of the other work done for classes (unless you're a business major whose only coursework are the tests themselves, I took the classes, don't pretend that's not true, your ruse of "group projects" be damned). Exams are also a high-stress activity, usually preceded by much caffeine, nail biting, and overactive reading.  Now maybe my methods wont' work for a lot of you, maybe they will, but hell, here's my advice to all you test takers, and even if you're not taking tests, we all get quizzed from time to time.  Here's what helps me (use at your own risk).  Wear comfy clothes.  No use being uncomfortable, trying to look good for the ladies (or guys as the case may be).  Trust me that no one else in class is checking you out during this test.  Being comfortable is the first part of being able to focus your mind.    Eat somethign earlier in the day, but do not eat right before the test.  You don't want a gurgling belly irritating you, but you dont' wanna get all dreamland sleepy when trying to remember what the fuck the symbol for projection in relational algebra looks like (it's a large pi symbol btw).    Don't cram right before the exam. Take a freaking break and play some ping pong or something. Those last second mindscrapes usually end up confusing most of us.  It wouldn't hurt to give a cursory glance through some examples right before the exam starts, but if it's 2 hours beforehand, take a breather.  Studying the night before is cool tho.     Study groups only work if you actually study material.. They don't work if you're talking about bullshit.  It's been my expereince that the majority of "study groups" turn into a social gathering in about 20 minutes. Either try to steer the conversation back to study, try to excuse yourself early, or plan ahead so that you can get your people thinking about any questions you have in that first 20 minutes.    Finally, when you're taking the test - focus on it like a motherfucker.  If you don't know the answer to one question skip ahead to the next, don't waste time pondering until you're certain you've got everything that is "for sure" down.  Then go back and do those other questions. for some people this is a time thing, but for me, sitting around trying to do something I"m not sure of breaks my concentration, gets me out of that "zone".  Whichever, it's a tried-and-true strategy.  That "zone" is your best mofoing buddy when you're testing, you'll be able to remember things, maybe even recall whole pages of diagrams and such.    Finally, don't study too much. this is very possible, and will seriously screw you. go over your reading twice and be done with it. you have a question about something, get it answered, remember the answer and stop.  You can overstudy, and it will screw with your head.    Oh ya, and the best tip you'll ever get - go to fucking class, and listen when you're there. put down your calculator with the games, put down the palm pilot with your scribble drawings, hell, put down your pen and just listen. Profs arent' talking to hear themselves, they'd rather not be there either. but it's what makes it work, and they know more than you do, I promise.  I don't know that I've ever had a class where 90% of all the test material wasn't touched on in class.     Another thing - studies show that you can do better on an exam if you can recreate the environment in which you studied the material. So if you learn it in class, all the better, but if you learn it on your own, try to minimize things that you have around you that you won't have in class (like beer, loud music, and your computer screen).  I'm out.

      Hello Bloggy blog. I know I haven't posted in damn near forever, but I'm back with style now baby.  Well, lets catch you guys up a bit. I have done more work this last month than a man should in three.  I also have some important announcements regarding me:  1) I am now local ACM president at OSU, so bow down. 2) I got hired for a contract to work on a game that I've been looking forward to for a couple of years now (more on that in a bit) 3) all our puppies have been given good homes, and 4) I am still unemployed.  OK, now onto the more exciting bits of that - the game dev thing especially.  Back when I was a kid, my dad bought our first computer. It was a 286. It was wonderful.  We went through more than a few upgrades over the next few years, so I can't remember which iteration of hardware we were on when I started playing the game that changed my young little life. The Bard's Tale.  My goodness I loved that game. Played it for hours on end. Beat it and thought I was the biggest badass around.  It was first person oriented Computer RPG, similar to the wizardry series (but a bit more interesting in my opinion).  Anyways, I loved this game dearly. Fast Forward to 2 years ago - I find that there is a group of indy developers working a game that is "loosely based" on Bard's Tale. I was ecstatic, I went and checked out the website and all that rot.  It looked grand and totally took me back to being an 11 year-old in front of dad's PC.  So I joined up on the mailing list.  Well, I go back every few months, and the game does seem to advance (albeit slowly, these guys are all doing this in their spare time).  The game goes through some major revisions and all that.  Lately, it's started too look like it's getting close to being finished, and I toss off the random email offering my services to help test or even do some extra dev work they got layin around, as I want to get the ball moving so I can play this darn game.  They were cool about it and said they'd offer me some testing stuff.  A few weeks later lo and behold, I get an email saying, hey, we ran into a snag with one of our developers, you care to jump in and get some stuff doen for us?  Of course I jump on it, they said there were a few others who were interested, and they'd have to check into all of us, but in the end i got picked. So yippie yay me!  I'm rocking the hisouse now, and I'll even get a share of the profits from teh game, so hey, even better!  anyways, the game  has a website at: http://www.devilwhiskey.com go check it out if you like.  I'm tired now, it's a bit late. I'll start posting a little more regularly, promise (things are certainly still busy in the gradschool front, but hey, it'll be better soon).  Phil.

      Just for Brian -  Whoop Donkey.  I got a job. Yup, that's right. Neato, I'm employed!  So the big question is, do I stay in grad school? The answer - sorta. I dropped my daytime class (which I really really hated) and I'm keeping my nighttime course, which I only kinda hate.  Over the summer I will be doing nothing but working at my job and on that game, and then during the Fall semester I'll take another nighttime course. we'll see what happens from there.  Some might say "there are only 3 weeks left in teh semster, why would you drop the course?" to which I say "cause it sucks".  I wasn't doing so well as it was, but it was just getting to be ridiculous.  How about some homework, some tests, and some massive programming projects still left in the semester for BOTH my classes.  OS2's projects are immense, and frankly, I got better ways to use my time now. :D  So for those who care to know more, I'll be working at a place here in stillwater called "SST Software". they do GIS systems for agriculture.  I'll be learning to write .NET applications, which I have mixed emotions about, but I"ll be doing it for a good salary, of which the only emotion I have is elation :).  Anyways, I hope everyone else who is unemployed gets to go back into the workforce. My only problem now is whether or not I'm still qualified to watch the cartoons at oddtodd.com  Out.

      Hello and welcome back.  Well, I've completed my first 2 days on the job, seems OK so far. I think I'm still catching a bit of "the new guy" cold shoulder from folks, but things were warmer on my second day as opposed to my first. I'm starting to get into the swing of things there.  Tomorrow will be an adventure, I get to work all day and then go to a 3 hour night class. We'll see if I survive or not.  So I realized this weekend that I am one busy sombitch, check it - I have like 4 jobs! First there's the new one - the full time bit at SST, then I have my TA responsibilities, and while that has been scaled down *significantly* from what it was, I still am grading papers and holding one office hour per week. The third is only an hour or two a week, but a responsibility to meet nonetheless, I'm tutoring a person in CS 1 / java programming so they can go to grad school at cornell and have a leg up on the program there.  Finally, i'm still doing the game dev thing, which rocks by the way, and I really hope something more could come of that.  Heck, maybe our game wil be a hit, and they can afford to hire some full timers, like me ;).  So anyways, add them up, that's 4 jobs.  plus a night course for grad school, plus family commitments, ACM presidency, 2 dogs, and a new gamecube (heh).    Man, I can't wait for the semester to end, that'll help bunches. Think I'll leave this one short, it's late and this old working stiff needs to go to bed so he can get up at a decent hour tomorrow.  Later. Phil.

      Holy Crap.  The air conditioning in our office at SST is apparently broken for the one single room that I happen to work in (we're upstairs and have a seperate air conditioner from the rest of the folks.  it's gotten as hot at 91 degrees F inside here today, and I'm about sick of it.  Having had a heatstroke this weekend, I'm kinda fearful of being in this heavy heat all damn day long, but so far, no problems.  Aside from that, my day has been dull.  Tired of a lot of things right now, wishing I could just go and curl up in a ball for a few days and come  out refreshed.  I realize that's not gonna happen, and such is life. Still sucks tho ;)  Our 2 dogs got out of the yard this morning, and we got another ticket for Dog at large (2nd time this has happened since we lived here, first time was like september last year).  Pretty annoying when you just did a lot of work on a fence and they still break out.. fixing that fence was what gave me the heatstroke in the first place. Bastards.  I'm thinking I may leave work a bit early today, with all the heat it's hard to think about much of anything, and I've had enough shit on my mind lately that's kept me from being able to focus as it is.  Mostly money stuff, you know how that old rot can be.  I'm thinking about writing a few programs and selling them on eBay, maybe a movie collecting program that I'm writing for myself, and perhaps I'll do that budgeting program for my church that dad wanted.  The game is still going strong btw, we should hopefully be finished with the public demo at the end of this month (July) or the VERY beginning of August  the site is still at  urlLink www.devilwhiskey.com  if you missed the link before now.  Good stuff, and we've come a long way with it.  Hope those of you who are reading this will enjoy.  Oh, and if you see me around, make me enroll in a grad course NOW. I haven't enrolled yet, and I'm realizing that I really should.  Phil.

       urlLink Google Search:  Just got the new google 2.0 toolbar beta at work, thought I'd check it out. Kinda neat, it lets you add to Blogger at any time by clicking a button on the toolbar while surfing, blocks popups (dont' have to install mozilla at work anymore) and lets you search google immediately (being the google toolbar of course. )  Neato  Maybe now I'll actually update this page a bit more frequently.

      Thankfuly, our Air conditioning got fixed on Friday last week. That helped a lot. Having all kinds of fun at work with Web Services.   That part was serious. Internet Explorer is the best browser for my site there.   That part was NOT serious.  We require our users to use Internet Explorer.  Being an admittedly big-time mozilla firebird (formerly phoenix) fan-boy, I was kinda ticked about that.  I was even more ticked when I found out how crappy IE can be to develop websites for. Since we're using ASP.NET, we are really pretty much stuck with IE as a client browser, since Microsoft's Technologies tend to play best when they play together.  Unfortunately, MS's bastard child of a web browser doesn't play well with Cascading Style Sheets or PNG image files (you know, the standard way to format web pages, and the recommended Web Image format - according to the W3C).  CSS is horribly nasty in IE - but PNG is even worse.  See there's this thing called an alpha channel.  an alpha channel lets you determine how  transparent  or  opaque  an image is.  PNG's lets you specify it on a per pixel level, with varying levels of transparency across the image.   The only comparable popular graphic format we have on the web is GIF.  GIF's have only recently come out of a problem with the compression algorithm patent, which was a concern before.  But on top of that, the format is WAAY too dated.  You're limited to 256 colors, and the alpha support is really nothing more than an on/off switch for transparency - as in all or none.  So hey, PNG overcomes all those limitations, and they render great in every modern web browser, on every platform. Except for Internet Explorer on windows.  ya.  sucks...  even IE for Apple can render them properly.  Just not, you know, the biggest audience with the largest market share.  It can't quite do it.  So what's a web dev to do?   Hack it up. Seems there's a workaround using some direct X image style filter that ONLY works with IE, and isn't a real clean workaround.  But at least it does something  Sad sad day, that I'd be bitching about web design :(  on another note - the Game development is doing well, we're supposed to go code freeze for demo this weekend, we'll see if that happens.  I only really have one thing to work out now,  one last bard song implemenation.   We'll see if I can swing it in time or not..  I got 2.5 done this evening, even with changing the tire on my wife's car, and driving around town for a bit after I got off work to show her some places she's trying to scout out for employment.  This last bard song is a bit more complex than the others that I've done, but I shouldn't have much problem getting it done given an entire afternoon.  I'll post more details about everything once I get some more free time.  Phil.

      Oh Fortune how you mock me. Now the air-conditioning in my home is messed up. We have 2 window units - the one in our living room (that also gets the kitchen, bathroom, and hallway) is blowing warm air. The one in our bedroom still works OK, but it' pretty much does the bedroom only, and doesn't help much.  Time to call the landlord again.  Sad thing is we had it recharged like a week ago.  may be time for a new unit (yay).  I'd love it if she just put in central air, that'd make me smile, but I think there's about as much chance of that happening as there is a chance of me becoming a millionaire.  In which case I wouldn't be renting this little house anyways ;)  So the game dev is VERY near completion, we hoped to have code complete this weekend, doesn't look like that will happen, but demo-level code is complete on my end at least until the lead programmer gets his stuff in, and then I'll be able to finish off my last bit of demo-flagged code (hopefully that'll happen tonight).  I still have more stuff to finish before the game is done, but it's definitely the end now.  If what's left on my plate is all that's left, then I think I can finish it before school starts - which would be good since I won't have much time once school hits.  Oh - father-in-law may have hooked me up with a new contract now too.  Some company that needs a database mgmt system to track their inventory or something.  Apparently they've been managing the whole thing with a spreadsheet so far, and it's getting to be too big (HAHA, imagine that!)  so sounds like a simple database insert/update/delete form is all that is needed.  Heck, if they have access, and it's only one user, I won't even bother to make a full program, just do it with Access forms in an afternoon ;)  They were paying a PC tech like $300 to install/setup a PC so they must not be too scared to pay for their tech. This makes me smile.  might make a decent wage off of this one.  later all Phil.

      Wow.    Things kinda suck right now. But they're hella better than they were.  I have been the epitome of busy, tired and angry over the last couple of weeks, and it's really starting to show.  I hate it when things get like this, but the whole summer has pretty much sucked ass.  I know the people I work with have gotta think I'm one unlucky mother, and I hate to say it, but if you'd just been looking at my life since may of last year, you'd be right.  Here's a quick rundown of just a brief selection of the things I've had to deal with in the last 3 months. 1) Wife's car - broke down 2 times - once for the power steering pressure hose, and most recently (as in 2 days ago) the alternator went out 2) My car - broke down 2 times also - once was the heater core, second was the battery( 1 day ago).     for about 2 hours there, we had  0 drivable vehicles... now that sucked. 3)  Wife got laid off from her job at end of June  -   just recently started working again - still waiting on that first paycheck. 4)  After Shanna got laid off, we've visited the doctor or the hospital about 6 times.  the medical bills are really starting to pile up. 5)  Shanna had to have an emergency root canal on an abcessed tooth - no dental insurance (job's dental is pretty much worthless) 6)  Auto Insurance company who can't figure out how to properly charge a credit (debit actually) card and charge me twice what i actually owed. 7)  lack of funds in a big way.  With Shanna losing her job, me just starting one (that only pays once/month no less), all the doctor bills and car repairs... we're just barely squeezing by.   Shanna got a partial paycheck today, that is not enough to cover our next bill.   how we'll get past it until the end of the month is my current worry, and lord knows I have enough of that at the moment 8) Shanna's mom died 9) My grandfather (maternal) died. 10)  My sister (whose recent marriage was a highlight in this summer) is having trouble finding work - with a BS and a GPA of 3.98 to show for it too) 11) Game development is still going OK, but we're having trouble getting the last bits cleaned up.. some team members fell on some extraordinarily rough times, and that is causing troubles getting some content finished up. 12) I have trouble sleeping lately  (wonder why) 13) Loosing too much weight from the sleeplessness and the stress. 14) my dogs have fleas, and no medicated shampoo or flea collar seems to be helping the poor bastards.  Ick. Like the old quote goes tho, leave them with a great ending, and they'll feel like they had a good time (para.)  so here's the good things I've got going on: 1) still married 2) I'm employed - even if it's not my first pick, the job is getting better, and it's a good income 3) I'm working on a video game - and they finally got my name up in the credits.. now that's fucking cool no matter how you look at it. 4) even with all this I'm still managing to go to graduate school - class starts tomorrow for me (once/week) 5) my dogs are still fun and cute when they're not itching 6) my cars work now. and I was able to do most of those repairs myself, saved cash that way. (didnt' do the power steering hose, not enough time) 7) Shanna's got work now, and that's helping her out immensely 8) it's my birthday on Sunday, I'll turn 25, and my insurance rates will go down quite a bit, YAY.  there we go, so it's not all bad, but it's enough bad to have me pissed off, which, if you've been reading this long enough, you know can be entertaining in and of itself.  Phil out.  p.s. - www.devilwhiskey.com - we've been updating a bit lately.

      Well alright party people. I made it til payday :D one thing down, 700 more to go.  I'm certainly in a better mood now, still haven't gotten much sleep, but that's OK, it's a holiday weekend! so here's how things have been lately -  did my first deployment to our public webserver, until now I've mainly worked up internal apps for us, you know, stuff to help us manage our business more effectively. It helps the company to better streamline their workflow. In a slightly more common tongue - my apps have helped us get our work done quicker and easier.  However, I've finally gotten to put something out to our members only website - in other words, for subscribers only, but still, people other than employees are getting to see some of my work.   Have put out 2 things - 1) a new menu written in Javascript instead of the hairy VBScript one we had that included 12 asp files on every page just to generate the menu (decrease load time substantially I'd say) - and 2)  a new mapping page that is totally frickin awesome - and has consumed my worklife every day for about 3 weeks now, with only occasional breaks to maintain other stuff.  its' neato , you go to the menu, pick out a client, one of their farms, and one of their fields (from a pop up javascript dialog box, with data generated on the fly) - and then tell it to "go" - it then calls a webservice that takes in those inputs, goes and finds all the data we have related to that field - each set of data called a theme - each theme has a legend and a map associated with it - and each field has from 1 - 40 themes.  so my webservice takes the field, finds all the data, and DYNAMICALLY CREATES LEGENDS AND MAPS from it.  frickin cool stuff.  it's not just grabbing predefined images, but actually creating them.  I'm creating all the images as PNG's, and that way I can have a variable amount of transparency/opacity for each map image - meaning that when you stack all the differnent theme maps up together, you can actually see through them to the others.  As if that wasnt' enough - I also call another webservice from my webservice, to download aerial imagery and topographical maps from  urlLink  TerraServer  which I then scale, trim, and place behind my maps - so you can see that your Ph levels are low, becuase that field has a high spot, or because it runs next to the road and gets a lot of crap dripped down on it when it rains.  The web page also lets you dynamically drag and drop the legends in order to change the way the maps stack - in real time with no posting back to the webserver. - oh, you also choose to turn the themes on and off on the fly as well - you could have all 30 turned on, or nothing, just click a checkbox next to the theme name. I'm quite proud :D  the Game dev is going well - the MIA developers have still not shown much oomph. Got one guy kinda back. Hasn't done much but complain so far, so we'll see how much good he does.  Still, even with that kind of setback, we're still kicking ass. CEO decided to slip the date a week.  I think we coulda done it, but I'm glad to get to enjoy my holiday weekend.  I think I finished the last major coding section of it tonight - we decided to add it in so that we could include all the skills for each class, and not just a demo-tagged subset. So our users will probably be able to transfer their saves to the new game without much problem, which is a goal I think we should shoot for.  Now that the codebase is done, we can focus on scripting hte plot events. - guess I get to learn python, cause that's what we're using there.  I fixed about 8 scripts earlier, just by reading through some ones we had that I knew worked, doesn't seem horrible, but I'd have to have to create them from scratch, as I'm still pretty lost on it.  I've chatted enough for now, time to get back to work.  Phil.

      HOT DAMN!!!!!  Looky where my game was mentioned:  urlLink Penny Arcade!   Das right. our last conservative estimate was around 6,000 downloads.  we know there are several mirrors out there that we cannot count download stats from.  If you haven't checked it out yet, you really should.  That is all Phil.

      wow, I haven't posted in a LOOOOONNNGGGGG time.  So, time for an update. The game's final release date was delayed from Oct 31st to Nov 30th. We're accepting preorders starting Nov 7th (3 days away AACK).  Justin, our lead dev and CEO,  has asked me to take over the administrative duties for the project, since he's going to be extremely busy at work for the next 3 weeks.  Poor guy is doing 16 hour days  7 days a week for awhile  - they're trying  to get everything spic and span for some large IEEE convention, so that they can assure themselves funding in the future.  So I'm gonna be HELLA busy over the next three weeks. School seems to be going OK, day job is going well, I got a nice raise that I'm finally getting to see now - fricking once/month paychecks ;).  Gonna be pretty busy with the day job followed by the game dev. - School program just got finished so now I freed up a bit more time.  Ordered a 20" trinitron refurb, what I got wasn't a trinitron, and was messed up - colors bled on the edges, text was  fuzzy in the top left corner, gaving me a headache, so I'm RMAing it and trying again.  Chris Berry up here at work ordered similarly, and got a nice monitor apparently so I don't feel too bad about it.  the 21" is nice even with the slightly off display, I love having 3 coding windows up at once, and it makes the virtual desktops in linux that much cooler ;).  Apparently Anil has a friend who'd like to buy my old 17" on the cheap, and I'm more than happy to sell it once I get a decent monitor from surpluscomputers.  Speaking of Anil - just a little tip for all the foreign people reading this... Don't take pictures of airplanes in the US.  or near a US armory.  Anil is an amateur photographer (who does great work BTW) and was snapping some shots of some woods around here, not knowing our Armory was behind the trees.  Then he caught a picture of a plane taking off too.  Someone drove by and saw a dark-skinned man taking photographs and called the cops.  This was about a month and a half ago.  last week on Friday his wife was interrogated by the FBI and then yesterday the FBI came back again to interrogate him.  They asked him a lot of questions, they took a CD of the pictures he'd taken, and amazingly enough - the asked him if he was a Muslim.  Seems like I remember questioning someone on the basis of religion to be illegal, but maybe it's OK if you're asking them if they're a muslim, since that automatically makes them evil :|.  Anil is Hindi anyways, so he didn't give two craps.  From what I've noticed he doesn't seem to care for the Muslim's a whole lot anyways ;).  In India the 3 main religions are Hindi, Islam, and Christianity, and apparently they don't mix real well at times.  Anyways, I really wanted to put up something, felt kinda like I was letting the blog slide too long.  So now I've posted for the few of you who may one day read this in a fit of boredom.  Enjoy.  Phil.

      After another nice long pause between posts I'm back. So lets recap what's gone on since the last post.  Game went out Dec 1st, and we sold several copies. Lots of bugs to stomp and such, and while I wish the initial release was cleaner, I'm pretty proud at my ability to keep up with the onslaught. We have a really great community of players, and their infinite patience is something I apprecaite.  I really think we filled a void with Devil Whiskey, as that new bard's tale game - once the hope of many - turns out to be a clone of Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance, but with a smarmy bard full of 2-bit humor.  Thus Devil Whiskey is really the only outlet for those who want to play the old style CRPGs, but with a new story, better music and graphics.  It's not selling quite as well as I had hoped, but it is selling none-the-less, and I have a sticky feeling that there are a LOT of peopel waiting for a few patches to come out before they'll buy it.  We're also working up some content expansions over the next few weeks, give them some neato stuff to play through, more interesting levels in my book, as they're all self-contained, and arent' being used to further plot - so they can all have nifty interesting stories, riddles, etc.  I'm still continuing to work at SST, and I enjoy it more all the time. Getting into some really fun problems to solve now, a bit more challening. Also, now that I have several apps out there, I'm getting busier with the rest of the business, fixing problems for them, expanding feature-sets and all that.  Good stuff, feel a lot more useful there now.  Finally, the big cool new news - I'm about to buy a home.  My cousin Shawn has a contract to sell a house for someone, and it's a pretty smooth deal.  They need to dump the mortgage ASAP, so it provides us a good oppurtunity to buy it underneath the appraisal value.  We'll end up bagging about 10% equity on the deal, which is great in my mind.  Only thing standing in our way is the lack of a strong account balance for the past few months. Mom and Dad sent me the rest of the cash they were paying me for my back-log of grad-school expenses, and that's plenty to have in the bank for the mortgage company, but it's simply a matter of how long it's been there, they want to see it there for teh last few months. Which it hasnt' been.  I've been tossing out a lot of cash on paying down debt, and Shanna's really only just started working a steady job again, which is the majority of our extra cash, so for about the last month or so, between her earnings, and the game royalties, our financial situation improved ten-fold.  Now getting the house and dealing with the rental lease is my main worry, and will hopefully all be settled soon.

      Well, it's been a few MONTHS since I've said anything...  and what a few months it has. another recap: 1) Not buying a home.. more on that later - I'm prety angry that it didn't happen, and yet glad it didn't in a way. 2) SST still going strong, I'm a dev lead on a new project that i'm really liking. I'm enjoying getting out of pure-codemonkey status, and getting into system design in addition to coding. 3) Oh ya - I'm divorced now - thus topic 1 :)  So ya, single FyL is back on the scene, mothers lock up your daughters.  Or don't, if they're old enough for me, they probably don't live there anymore anyways, and I'm not exactly the "grab the first 18 year old you see, cause she thinks your cool cause you can buy beer" type anyways :)  Why'd I get a divorce? If you want to know, I've probably already told you, if not - well sorry, ask me sometime.  When did I get a divorce ? we split up about 5 days after that last post (Jan 10) and were official divorced at some point in February (18th I believe).  So where am I at now?  Same geographical location.  New truck though! yay!  Explorer was about done for, so I traded it in and got myself a 2000 Ford F150, my first Full-Size truck ever.  Used to have an S10 in high school, but it had certainly been awhile, definitely liking a car I can actually fit in comfortably, gotta give thanks for that.  Well, it's late, I'm tired, and no one reads this thing but me, and maybe Brian or Kaleb.  Hi guys if you're there. If you're not, I hate you suck.  or something. I dunno  Anyways, I hope this message finds everyone happy, healthy, and a bit wiser from the days experiences.  If you know any hot chicks who would like to date a total dork like me, please feel free to send em my way. I'm both a scholar and a gentleman.  Phil.

      I'm trying to keep up with my typical post-once-every-three months schedule - so far I'm right on track ;)    Well, lets see - what all neato new things are going on in my life.  As per usual - the small stuff first:       Finished with Devil Whiskey - it was mucho fun, and I really enjoyed my time there - but the contract has been completed, and I just really don't have enough time to continue on there. The game is still selling well, and the europeans are pouncing on it whenever a magazine article comes out in their country.     Still at SST - still kicking ass there - things are getting tight - we have a seasonal release schedule (being ag based) so this time of year finds us pushing to get all the new stuff done to be ready for fall planning.     Almost done with the Shanna payments - ready for that to be over and done - close that chapter of my life. Got back the Honda she had - she never arranged for new financing so I have to sell it to pay off the lien - there was some mechanical stuff wrong with it that needs fixing first so I'm gonna be trying hard to break even on the deal. Honda's have great resell value, but tossing 60k miles on car in a year will hurt you no matter what kind of car it is.    So that's all the typical here's my life right now news and then the biggie (like you probably don't know or can't guess):    I've met an amazing girl     Her name is Jennifer, she lives here in Stillwater. She's about to finish her M.S. in Psychology, and will be pursuing her PhD shortly thereafter. Very intelligent, kind, and interesting woman. She rocks my frickin socks off and that's that. If you need to know more, you can probably find me easily enough otherwise, I'll catch up with ya later in another three months when I'm halfway through next semester's courses (which will suck).      Anyways, that's enough info for now, see ya soon.
