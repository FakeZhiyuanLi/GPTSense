        Man was last night awesome.    Yesterday Sam came and met me at work and then Jason, him and I headed to Portland to meet A Kiss Farewell and Fall of Troy on their way back home from their tour. We left a little late, but when we got there we found out it didn't really matter anyway. The promoter had double booked the gig, so AKF only got to play for about 10 minutes, and FOT got to play 3 songs. We made it for the last FOT song. I listened from outside.    I had a long, long, long talk with Jeff from AKF tonight while we were there. It was really cool to get to know him and find out what an amazingly intelligent guy he is. He is very thorough about how he thinks. I really enjoyed talking to him a lot and found him&nbsp;to be really insightful on a lot of things.    On a related note, at Riley's house that night I began to really get to know Gordan. I had a bunch of long talks with him about a variety of things, but found out he is a totally awesome guy. He seems like he is totally someone that if I had a chance to talk with would really get me, and I think I would probably get him too. He was kind of my buddy for the night, because Jason was bored and not into the drinking thing. Gordan and I ended up fairly drunk on Riley's front lawn looking at the stars and Sam came out and showed me some badass constellations.    So, it turned out, Thomas, Sam, Riley, Myself, Gordan and one of the guys in The Woods (whose name I cannot remember) all ended up staying up till sunrise and then piling on top of each other to go get breakfast in Battleground. It was cool, but I didn't get much sleep at all when we got back and spent the majority of today dealing with a minor hangover, which was&nbsp;made&nbsp;worse&nbsp;by my major lack of sleep and shower. So we drove back to Bellevue, and I went into work for a few minutes, trying to hide what a bad condition I was in, and now I am back home. It's nice to be back with my Coby, because I missed him dearly, and I'm pretty sure he missed me... He only whined and jumped around and licked my face for like, 40 minutes when I came in the door. Ah... to be greeted with such love.   Yesterday was fun, but why do I have to feel wide awake now?&nbsp;&nbsp;        urlLink  www.thefalloftroy.com       urlLink  www.akissfarewell.com   &nbsp;      urlLink  www.birdshapedholes.cjb.net         urlLink www.thewoodsrock.com

       oaugh, it   kills   me. The Arguement. A whole period of my life summed up in that sentence. I love that cd.       I've actually been writing a movie. I started yesterday and got a bunch done. The whole first 10 minutes I think. Heh, it's not that much, but it's more of a start than I've had. Besides, some really good movies take years...       Don't worry, I'm not writing a really good movie.      So, lately I have so realized that life is much more relaxed than I ever knew how to make it. For the first time crazy stressful shit is going on, but something just feels ok. I am not as anxious all the time. I think it has a lot to do with not living with my mom, which must sound awful, but I hate it say it true.      I love my mom. I think about her all day lately. My mom. She is my mom.       Tonight at Ground Zero Shane and Brent just stopped by to hang out. It was awesome. I made a decision without Sam. It was incredibly minor, and I don't think he will mind, and he makes the same sort of decisions that I did without asking me, so I think it's ok. It's cool, because I feel like I am finally becoming involved with the company stuff a lot more and like I can assert my ideas and thoughts on stuff. Definately cool.      I need to get some books. I need some new books. I love my books, but I'm getting tired of the same old ones. I have been going to the library, but I hate borrowing a book from someone. I like to make books my own very much.       I need to listen to music more. I think it will make me much happier. I think The Woods are my favorite band... Possibly of not even just local music. I heard some new tracks... God. I LOVE them. Fucking love them, everybody, just get it over with and love them already. They will rule this town. Them and The Fall of Troy... which is a weird pair, you must admit, but definately an awesome one.      Ou, it's 2 am... I am so awake, we are watching the funniest cartoons that Eli just got today.      I love you Mogwai. Please lull me to sleep tonight.

       My mom is sick. I don't know how to deal with it in the least.      Jason has been there for me so much. So much more than anyone else in my life has ever tried to. He needs me. He has needed me. I wasn't there for him. Not as much as I should have been. I love him. I need to be better to him. I need to be more forgiving.      I hung out with a bunch of people from that Fall of Troy scene last night. It was kind of cool. I don't think I really fit in with any of them though. On the plus side though I finally got to hang out with the rest of Bird Shaped Holes in the Sky and Dustin is totally hilarious and really smart. He was awesome. Him and Gordan are really fun together and play off each other very well. They are awesome to hang out with and I think I'd like to hang out with them.      I'm getting my school stuff taken care of finally. That has been the good part of today.

       So this blog thing is still not really catching on with me. I just can't motivate myself to do it. I'm starting to think that it is just impossible for me to really motivate myself to do anything, espeacially write, which sucks, because I want to write more. When I was younger that is all I would do... Now I can hardly even manage to post one thing a day.       Whateves.      Gordon and I went over to Sam's last night and surprised him while he was in the bath. It was fun. We ate pizza and I got sick. Then Jessica and Jeremiah came over, man are they cute.       I feel so alone when I'm with people, and I feel so crowded with my own thoughts when I'm alone. I can't talk to anybody anymore, nobody really knows who I am anymore and I don't feel like I have made a genuine connection with someone in ages. The closest and coolest thing I have going for me right now is that a) Sam and I are becoming pretty good friends I think. I like the idea of him being my friend. My family causes such issues of love and hate with me. It is so much easier to be Sam's friend. I like the idea of being friends. b) I think I am becoming friends with Gordon. It's kind of hard tell right yet. He is awesome and I'd really like to be friends with him.      Seth is sick today, so work is miserable. I think I want to go home.

       I am on my weekend.      It doesn't feel like it for some reason. The stiffness in my neck and back won't go away. I am going swimming tomorrow. I think that will make me feel better.      Kim is back. I am glad. I hope she can cheer Sam up some. I know that he could use it, and I haven't been able to as of yet.      My kitten is finally starting to be comfortable in this apartment. She is so sweet when she runs around in the living room and begs for attention. I wish I could give her a house. I almost wish I was back with my mom. At least Coby could run around whenever he wanted.      Eli bought some Cartoons today at Fred Meyer. A bunch of the old Daffy Duck ones are super American Propaghanda movies. It is badass.      I think Kerry is going to be our next president. I am excited for it. The debates... god, I can hardly wait to see him debate. Edwards and Cheney and Bush and Kerry... what perfect people to go up against each other.      Seriously guys, seriously.
