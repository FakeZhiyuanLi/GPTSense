      Tonight was very fun and very red!!!!!!!!!  It was Jim's and Dawn's last saturday at TAG and we went to Players and ate pizza.  You see Jim and dawn always dress in the same color so as a little goodbye surprise we all decided to dress in red.  But when we got there Jim and Dawn were wearing red too!!!! So there was like twenty peoples wearing red.  Its a good thing that i don't hate the color red.  Anywho!! Afterwards lots of red wearing peoples came over for some worship and some injuries on the trampoline.  Good news! No one was hurt except for Stephie's really really bad trampoline burn!! :( BAD TRAMPOLINE BAD TRAMPOLINE!!!!!!!!  So now everyone is gone and it is 11:36.  It is quiet and I am the only person in this house who is wearing red right now!!! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOoo HOOOOOOOOOOoo.  Yeah so um if you want to know the things we red people do to be entertained go to eldawen.blogspot.com and read the post with a bunch of peoples talking.  Parts of it do make sense!! If you were here then u wouod understand!!! bye non-red wearers!  P.S. I have had so much pizza this weekend that i don't think i will evr eat any ever again.  Actually i will probably eat left over pizza tomorow so never mind.  Goodnight yall!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :) )))))))))))))))))))))))))))))******************** it's a shooting star. (i think).

      hey everybody!!!!!!!!! guess wut? next saturday if u are an attender of TAG wear a shirt with duct tape on it saying i love bobby!!!!!!!!!!1 bobby is in a band and is famous so we are his official fan club. however he did tell us that we are competing against another fan club. but that will be no problem cuz we are crazy people!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! so yeah don't tell bobby but act like bobby is so famous and wear we love bobby merchandise!!!!! yeah so shhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!! its a secret! anywho last night was so cool. we had lots of visitors at TAG and during worship i started feeling a really sharp pain in my left ankle. sometimes when u just all of a sudden have a pain any where on your body for no reason it typically means that someone in your general area who has a pain in that same area. so yeah i was searching for that person and asking around. so i fnially announced it into the mike during worship.  it was very funny though because kimber deaville was announcing it a second time and i turned arouind and there was a girl there named brittany who said her ankle hurt. so i turned back around and was like kimber (tap on the shoulder a couple of times) kimber. kimber! kimber!! KIMBER!!!! so she turns around and iml ike here she is! lets go pray! wut happened was she dropped a heavy piece of wood on it and it was very swollen and she could barely stand. so we prayed for healing and she said that it felt a lot better  afterwards but it was still swollen. but it was so cool becasue she could comfortably stand and wasn't in pain. it was so cool!!! I LOVE GOD!!!!!!! HE IS SO AWESOME!!!!(upside down thumb and thumbs up!) ok so yeah crazy people might be coming over later so i gotta go! CRAZY PEOPLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      Everybody is still being really bad about updating their blogs.  Why is it so hard?? oh by the way thanx kenny for my cd and making sarah's cd so she won't steal mine! :) Man im tired! i think it is becasue on monday we had like a whole little trampoline get together thing.  actrually it was more of Les wanting to come over cuz he likes our trampoline and tehn krisann bringing over Andrew and Chris.  but yeah the last peoples finally left at 12:30 and then my friend haley spent the night and we stayed up with sarah until about 1:30 and then we watched a movie and i fell asleep. but yeah i think i am still recovering from that night.  It was fun but my parents say we can't have peoples over so late on weeknights anymore.  oh well.  i have to go cuz my cousin laura is here visiting from san francisco.  oh yeah DON'T FORGET TO UPDATE YOUR BLOGS PEOPLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      Hey! Last night I went to the drive-in with my borther and some friends.  We had sooooooooo much fun and super awesome god time!!!!  My paretns were even willing to let us use their van so we could take all of our friends that we ahd already promised ridse to.  However when we got home we had to wake up my parents and give them smoe unfortunate news.  Stephen decided to tell them in a very humorous way. "We ahve two bits of good news and one bit of bad news.  We had some super awesome god time and god is fixing it.  The bad news is that we put a really bad dent in your car when we ran into the speaker box."  And the truth is that god is fixing it because god told us he would heal the van but not to doubt that he would if it wasn't done when we wanted it done.  So anyways our mini-van has paint scraped off of it and a huge dent on the side.  But god is fixing it. oh and sad news is that our friend frank that we met last night is going to die.  yes... we named the dent.  please be praying though because god told us that for the van to be fixed that we have to have full faith that it will.  Unfortunately my dad has no faith that it will and the doubt my parents have could be passed on to the rest of us and then the van wo0n't be fixed. so please be praying that we will not doubt.  "God made even mini-vans!"

      Last night sooo awesome for me.  God revealed some stuff to sarah and she shared it with me andthen i wen tinto my room and stayed up like an hour and a half more than i should have just praising god as he continued to reveal stuff to me.  a lot of the stuff really hurt and amde me feel like crap but it hleped me to love my dad more especially since i ahve eben getting erally annoyed with him lately.  so ya it was awesome and i just wanted to share to encourage u guys that whenever u r down or feel like a crap just keep praising god because its all in his incredible plan for us and it all has a reason.  besides how would we have our great moments or even know when those are if we don't feel down sometimes.  it just makes us appreciate people and moments more more.  so ya i just wanted to encourage u guys to always praise god no matter wut.  love u all!!!! oh and thank u to gregg g. (i think) because ur comment was realy encouraging to me.  thanks so much!!!

      God is so super awesome! Each one of u should spend time with him everyday.  So anyways God recently healed me of pain in my knee.  I had it healed awhile back but when i kneeled or bent it it still hurt.  so anyways on saturday i was just kneeling before god at the santa maria vineyard and my knee started hurting. instead of letting the demons hinder my praising god i said no to the pain.  i wouldn't allow it. and then it stopped hurting and god said my knee was healed.  well on sunday after church i was limping through wal-mart telling the pain no once again.  when i got home i nearly collapsed because it felt like sumtin was stabbing me in the knee.  eventually it stopped when i continued to tell the demons no. it was awesome.  i also was healed of a kink in my neck. stephen was told there was a demon arrow stuck in it and stephie pulled it out and grinded it in her hands it is still slightly sore but krisann says that is just the soreness of it healing. it fells so much better. last night i was reading "when heaven invades earth" and my knee felt like it was being stabbed again.  the thing about demons is they like to stop u from doing something god enjoys and they are really stupid. my knee only hurt before when i kneeled or bent it.  and here they are trying to convince me that it wasn't ever healed.  well why then may i ask would it hurt while i was just sitting there when it didn't do that before. im not stupid but they sure are.  lol. i continued to read and it stopped. this morning i read some more of it and then read the bible and spent some time with god. i am trying to make a habit of this and u should all do the same.  god is so awesome.  in fact he deserves all your time. the least u can do is give him a half hour a day to just minister and speak to u.  wow! this is a long post so im going to stop now.  just spend soome time with god it will make ur day so much better. i love u guys lots and lots.  and so does god.

      Q:If you & Nosferatu were working the Cotton Candy booth together at the fair & he punched you in the head, would you- A: Sneeze a Revenge-Sneeze on him B: Tickle his Armpit C: Turn the other... head D: Tell his mom E: Other (Please Explain)  A: I would so tell his mommy. Then he would get in big trouble and he would be grounded.  It would be best if i turned the other head though but it is easier when people only do small mean things and punching me in the head is nota  small mean thing so i would struggle with that.  After i told his mommy i would tickle his armpit just for the heck of it unless it was sweaty then i would be grossed out.  Now i have a question.  Why would i be working in a cotton candy booth and why would i be doing it with nosferatu? why not lesteratu or stephieatu or andrewatu or christaatu or kimberatu or krisannatu or stephenatu or other peoples...atu. :\ oh well, thanks for that wonderful question krisanny.  please everyone continue to make random questions. i would prefer if i could have a slight discussin with them so make them interesting and long or in need of explanation. i am good at those. lol have fun.

      Woo for super awesome god time! This weekend i went camping wih my best friend Haley and we went horseback riding and fishing and had fun.  besides that we had super awesome god time.  the most awesome invlvd yu-gi-oh cards.  for those of u who don't know wut the are i'll explain.  they are like pokemon cards except really scarry and evil.  u see had a friend who had them and knd of was attacked by demons a lot because of it. the cards talked to him in his sleep! so anyways her little bro conner and his friend love yu-gi-oh cards and technically he isn't allowed to bring them in the house but his parents don't enforce that rule so he does anyways.  well anywhoo his friend tanner brought some along on the camping trip.  haley and i found them and we prayed against them.  then god told us to rip them up an throw them away. we did. in the moring they were gone! woo! and so far tanner and conner haven't looked for them or mentioned them.  that is because there was a card that had a foot with a chain around it. god told haley and me that card was representing how the cards have captured some of the children who use the cards minds and lives. we also prayed against that and that their memory in conners's and tanner's minds would disapear along with the cards. so we were all excited about this.  unfortunately i kind of got depressed when haley and i found about 300-400 more cards of conner's.  we were depressed to deal with it so we hid them when we should have prayed more but its ok cuz god told haley that we have to talk to conner about them anyways otherwise he will keep playing with them.  we are kind of nervous about that so pleaase be praying for us.  thanks so much! oh yeah.  tanner has always seemed depressed to me.  he doesn't smile is really quiet and doesn't play with conner very much.  well after we got rid of the cards he smiled a whole bunch, was really hyper, played, and was happy. however he was wearing a yu-gi-oh shirt but oh well. thanks for your prayers.

      This is my brother Paul's puppy Bandit. It is an older picture but he is so cute. Well recently he died and my brother is so upset. Please be praying for him. He blames God for so much crap in his life and I am afraid he will blame God for this too.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

       Isn't God so awesome!!! Awesome isn't even the right word. Jesus is! lol God is soo Jesus (I will explain later).  &nbsp; So anyways I stayed home from youth group tonight because i wasn't feeling well and I needed to pack for Spirit West Coast.&nbsp;    I was worshiping God and I let Chloe (my dog) in from outside and she kept jumping and keeping me from worship. So i started praying in my spiritual language (tongues) and she began to growl and bite and was attacking me.&nbsp;  My first reaction was reachign for teh squirt bottle that we use on her whenever she is bad. Well that got ehr to back off for a minute and then god told me that it was a demon who was trying to stop my from worshiping god.   I told it to leave. I made it very clear that i will always worship god and that the demon had no right to try to stop me. After that I got really cold. It was werid though it was like insdide me but I can hardly explain it. I felt so afraid. Chloe ran upstairs and I had to go make sure all the bedroom doors were shut and I was so creeped out.   There i was home alone and afraid to be too far&nbsp;away from any form of light or from the music I was playing. Luckily I realized that it was demons trying to scare me so I told them that the house I lived in, my dog, my family, my yard, and everything I owned was god. i told them they had no place in my house. i commanded them to leave in jesus name and now i feel much better. lol   It saddens me when people do not use the full authority that god has given them in his kingdom. we have the power to cast demons out and heal the sick and raise the dead in jesus name. god wants u to take that authority and use it to bring others to him and to increase our faith along with the faith of others. isn't god incredible. and i am enjoying these new colors way too much! i love u guys and i get that love from jesus!

      I am so lame (just like Krisann! lol)! I need to post but for once in my life I have nothing to post about.  Maybe I should post about the fact that I am tired because I went to bed at midnight, woke up at 6 and went on an hour long walk with my mom and the devil-dog aka turtle eater, tehn i came home and took forever to fall back asleep and then woke up at 10:30. yes, i believe that is the reason I am tired. or maybe the sand-man gave me an overdose last night. oh well. somebody give me a random question and if I am awake I will answer it.  zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz! man now I am asleep becasue everybody took too long! zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

        "Do what you do and say what you want to say with or without regard for me. Scheme what you scheme when you're thinking of yourself. your the msot like ly to succeed."       from english to dutch to french to greek to english becomes...      "make that you made and say that you wants it says with if without l'estime with, the regulation that this you plant when you you thinks, most likely to achieve"      no i did not right the words above they are quoted from a wonderful five iron song entitled "Most Likely to Succeed" from their album "Our Newest Album Ever!" even though its not their newest album ever. in fact it is one of the first albums.       ~*~In loving memory of Five Iron Frenzy~*~

      I have been asked why i haven't been updating my blog. I really don't know. i haven't said anythign about spirit west coast but i think haley pretty much covered that. So you can read her blog about that. I have been hearing so much about the trip to Redding. i will let you read that on everyone elses blogs. god did awesome stuff at TAG the other day.  Please be praying that i would have strength and that i would be willing to do whatever god wants me to do. At TAG god told me that he was going to give me my brother Paul's pain. he has been through 9 surgeries and has been involved in drugs and i believe he still slightly is. god revealed some of the mental pain of paul's to me and then during worship on sunday was giving me a little bit of the pain so i would be prepared for when he gave it all to me. let me just sya one thing about that..."ow!" i really want to do this for god and for my brother. i just need lots of strength and i know god won't give me anymore than i can handle. just please be praying. i love you guys. i am so going to redding next year! there you go chris... er... hector!
