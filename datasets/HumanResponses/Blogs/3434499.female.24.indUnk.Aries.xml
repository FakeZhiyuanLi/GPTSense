						   Ohhh! Another week starts again. I have loads to do, but I have no clue at all.  Sad sad... Well I'll still try my very best, cuz it's my TASK, my responsibility.    Feels so good after sorting things out with Yusuke totally.  Well, I am proud of myself cuz I've done my best in the relationship.  I have no regrets for the decision I've made.  Of course I am not saying I'm being "sacrificial" or anything like that, cuz to me.. that's tooo vain.  hahaha..   I talked to Candice and Wing today.  We had a great chat.  They have been really encouraging, cuz they know I'm stressful with work now. Well, actually the three of us are very tired and exhausted with our current tasks.  Sometimes, we feel it's not in our control at all.  But I am sure God will lead us through, and He'll give us the wisdom we need for such tasks to be carried out.  Had dinner with JoLee and went to DFS for a while.    Happy to know that Phoebe is employed now!   Don't know why feel little upset this evening. :(

						   Went to church in the morning.  Not much done as usual, cuz it's a lazy Sunday.  Phewww~! I saw one Korean movie at home, it's difficult.  I couldn't get anything out of it.

						   I didn't do anything today.  I woke up at 2pm.  hehehe... I made one ramen for lunch and watched 3 VCDs at home with mom, kept munching on the junks I stocked.  We're sooooo laid back.  hahaha.   Did a 40-min exercise on the stepper.  At least I moved  a bit, while mom sat on the same spot all day long.

						   I'm really late today cuz I went to caregroup, and it ended at 11 15pm.  It's already 12 15am when I got home.    I went to HKU as usual for my "Research Friday".  I was really excited about the caregroup meeting over the week, but wasn't so enthusiastic today.  As Florence is also working at Central, we've decided to meet up after work and go to LAM TIN together for the caregroup meeting.  However, I thought of not going to HKU this morning, but the funny bit is: Stuart called and asked me to check a book for him from HKU library, and because of the appointment I made with Kerry on Tuesday, I decided to go in the end.  Well well... when I reached Admiralty, I gave Kerry a call, and she said she couldn't make it.  Then I said, "God! Apparently you made me leave home today!" So, I went to HKU and finished my research work for the day.    Around 5 30pm, I called Florence and tried to make excuses of not going.  She's been clever, she didn't let me go this time. HAha... Since we're supposed to meet at 7pm, I decided to take a long walk from HKU to CENTRAL (It took me 45 mins).  So we had a short chat at Starbucks, I'm pleased that she also realised I'm more at peace these days.  I don't know exactly why I hesitated to go to the caregroup meeting this morning,  I really don't.   But tonite, I found the group is really enthusiastic and encouraging.  I hope I can manage to attend this caregroup every week.    Good to know my sister Irene has received the acceptance offer from the College of Law in UK.  So she'll be leaving in late Aug, I suppose.  I hope Mom can cope with this, she'll be pretty lonely when both of us leave in August.  Jimmy is not in town, he's in Shanghai now.  I am jealous! How I wish I could have a nice break!

						   It's a tiring day.  I was extremely sleepy in the morning cuz I went to bed pretty late last nite.  Had a meeting with Stuart, talked about the three articles.  Sometimes, I really have no clue on the content and the "message" (if there's such) that the author wants to convey.  Well, I feel he's mystifying/reifying... blah blah blah.. Stuart thinks he's not... blah blah blah.  I'm often perplexed by all these jargons. Well... afterall it's all about JARGONS to distinguish ppl/ their fields.  So shallow!!!    The most stupid thing today was I spilled a cup of hot choco on my pink outfit!   I had dinner with Benedict (Ben) tonite, I had a great time.  Glad that he's given me help. I appreciate that so much.

						   Buddhist Bday is nothing to me.  Well, I didn't benefit from the public holiday, cuz I worked in the office.  Luckily, Wing was there with me!! I went to see Shrek II with Jor Jor (the guy with thousand nicknames)last night, it's a really really really funny movie. GOOD FOR A NICE LAUGH AFTER WORK!!! It's almost 3 30am when I got home.  I talked to GAI GAI (Michelle) for almost 1.5 hours!  Glad to know she's doing really fine in UK.  Sadly, we may not meet till the end of the year, earliest! Sigh~ I miss you Gai Gai!   I worked in the office today and went cycling with Boss (um...Boss Lee)I feel so good after doing an hour exercise, just like when you first get out of the steam room after "steaming" for 30 mins. Feels terrrrrific! I love it!    Got Shrek I VCD on my way home.   Ohoh!!! I broke my Ohio Mug (precious mug from God)today.  Would try to mend it by sticking the handle back in place this weekend.  Sad~    PDL Day 9 is soo inspiring!

						   It's only  4:45pm, but I've already finished my work for today.  Skimmed through 2 journals.  Wanna get sb out now, but can't think of anyone (or suitable person) on my mind.  May be I should go to Causeway Bay to get a birthday present for my dear dear kindergarten mate, Florence.  Actually I've got some ideas for her gift already.  I still have around 4 hours till movie time.  Sigh~ What can I do now? On my 8th day of the "Purpose Driven Life" journey, I am not as enthusiastic as last week... Aiya~ I don't wanna cool down yet!!

						   My dear colleague (and roomate), Candice, suggested this nice journal-site.  Thanks Candice!  My day was "OK!" Nothing much happened... sorta spent a peaceful day in the office.  Met Jimmy in the library, he told me his weird job-hunt experience! Got to the 7th day of my "Purpose Driven Life".

						   Felt dizzy in the morning, may be I'm really exhausted.  Time to take a rest.   I left office at 2pm, took a taxi home immediately.  I fell asleep on the couch.  And watched one VCD "Harry Potter II" intermittently during my nap.    I felt much better after the rest, and went to Festival Walk for dinner with JoLee and Samuel for his post-bday celebration as promised.  I still didn't feel well at dinner, but I didn't wanna eat my words.  Samuel raised a lot of questions on our belief.  It's a nice "debate" cuz I got to know his thoughts (well and others' thoughts).  I had an argument with my sister JoLee on our way back home.  Actually I tried to tell her something that happened to me. I wasn't pleased with her attitude, well I should have showed my understanding that she's impatient/inattentive.  At that moment, I was also being self-centred somehow; desiring comfort from her.  May be I talked about it at the wrong moment.  Shouldn't have started it on the train.   Anyway, shouldn't think about it now.  Must take some more rest.

						   After meeting Shirley and Natalie last night, I must say, I have a lot of mixed feelings.  In a way, I got to know what I should do, and gradually I feel my direction is getting clearer.  (Please pray for me!)  How I wish I could be bold enough to tell everyone I meet about my belief.  I am upset when I see people who doesn't understand at all.  How painful it is to see some of my friends/relatives feel lost in the world.    I don't know how long I'll be in the world, why can't I be bold enough to demonstrate my care? I really don't know how long I'll stay on earth.  I may seem to be really negative about life, but that's not true.  I am afraid, at some point, I may not have any chance to say "I love you" to those I care.    I love this song:   Seek ye first the Kingdom of God.  And His righteousness. and all these things shall be added on to you Hallelu~ Hallelujah!  I was still excited when I returned to the office this morning, though it should be a day off again.  The joy I gained last nite extended till today.  But it changed a little when I left my office at 2 20pm.  I was a little sad when I was on my way to the movie theatre.  I thought I would feel better after seeing a movie: "Troy".  May be I'm a little tired physically.

						   Thought of not going back to the office (took a day off from Stuart), but changed my mind in the morning.  Went to the library and borrowed a couple of CDs for copying.    I didn't work on my documents at all.  But I know that God wants me to go back.  Well, I had a talk with Claudia through ICQ, managed to catch up a bit and shared with her some of my thoughts and experiences. Then, I talked to Candice, she's a little upset.  Her friend's sister died, and everyone's grieving over that.  Well, then I got to realise that I know her friend (Sze Hon).  I didn't know how to comfort Candice, but I hope my presence in the office helped her a bit.  Candice, I know that it's hard to accept, and it's painful to know God is taking something away.  But I am sure God's purpose is always good. I don't know how I can comfort you, but I pray that Holy Spirit will speak to you with his sweet words, so you'll be comforted and strengthened.  (Plz pray for this friend of ours who's just lost her dearest sister, and pray for those around his family. Thanks!)    I had a meeting with Shirley tonite, it's been a long time since I last saw her. We haven't had such quality chat for long.  I am glad that I could share with her some of my experiences. I don't know if I could help her or not through my sharings, but I am sure that God gave us such a great moment tonight for us to meet again and chat.  I thank God that I got to see Shirley's sister, Natalie again (I tutored her several years ago).  She's a really sweet gal, I enjoy talking to her.  She has a really sweet face.  In fact, Natalie is on my mind all the time, I thought about her this morning, and didn't know that I would have a chance to meet her tonite.  She's a really sweet girl, my heart melts everytime when I see her smile.    I feel today's time is very well-spent.  I am assured that God's using my experiences somehow. Thank you Lord!

						   Woke up early for church sermon at 9 30am. Attended Sunday School at 11 15am about "Buddhism v.s. Christianity" Very interesting class. Would try to share my thoughts here later this week, after "chewing" the notes I received this morning.  Wing joined the Sunday School, so we went to Sham Shui Po for lunch with Jimmy.   After lunch, I had an adventure with Jimmy (a celebration for our PDL journey, we've finally finished our 40-day journey!!! Thanks to the Lord!)Well we took the "West Railway" from Mei Foo and went to Yuen Long.  At first, we thought of going to my grandpa's "gravestone" but it's too late, so we dropped the idea in the end.  But we visited a lot of places in Yuen Long.  His family's old "shop" and places he "lingered" when he was small.  Then we had a "rocky ride" to Tai Po by bus route no. 64k (would never get on this bus  again!)  Anyway, it's a super long day.  I am pretty exhausted now, but feels good cuz I walked a lot!!! My legs are soo sore now!I think I am tanned.

						   Finally, I have finished the 40-day journey of "The Purpose Driven Life".  I am really excited about it.    I woke up early this morning, watched Lord of the Rings III with Irene, I couldn't finish the whole movie cuz of lunch with Jimmy at Kowloon Bay.  Well, after that I went back to my office cuz Stuart scheduled a meeting with me 2 days ago.  The meeting was pretty long from 4-6pm, I'm pretty exhausted now.  We talked about the document I submitted yesterday.  Good to know that he's satisfied with this draft, I'll be making revisions over the next two weeks.   I went to Tsim Shai Tsui after the meeting.  Did some shopping with mom and my two other sisters, Irene and JoLee before dinner time.  We went to Kowloon City for hot pot, bro and Shirley were there too.  Bro hurt his arm last week while he's cooking, it's serious! He burnt his arm!  Interesting, I realised my bro and I have a lot of similarities.  First, everyone can tell we are bro and sis at the first glance.  Second, our fingers look alike.  Third, we bite our fingers (tho' I bite mine more often)... hahahaha... It's funny! Oh one more thing, we often put things under our noses, sniffed it before eating! hahahaha... That's some sorta weird behavior among our family (I think!) tho' few of my friends would do the same thing as well.  hehehe...

						   I woke up a little earlier than usual, did my PDL response in the morning.  And went to Pacific Coffee at Festival.  I stayed there for a little more than an hour to work on my document.  I managed to revise it before I returned to my office.    When I reached my office it was already 11am, I dived into my working mode immediately.  Thank God! I managed to finish my document before 3pm, it's not a long piece, but I think quality matters more.  I am pretty satisfied with the document, tho' I am sure Stuart will give me a lot of criticisms tomorrow to improve it.  Anyway I managed to finish it and sent it off on time! Yeh!   I went to caregroup tonite, was a little sleepy/tired during the meeting.  (Maybe the post-caffeine symptoms) I didn't have dinner cuz I didn't feel like it, so I just had a bowl of soup at my caregroup place.  I left at 10 30pm, a little earlier than usual.

						   This morning I made a short prayer asking God to use my time well, I handed over my schedule to the Lord.  I must say, I am really productive throughout the day.  For my document, I managed to get it more than half done. (Praise the Lord!) After work, I went to Kowloon Bay Telford Plaza to have a short chat with Boss Lee.  After the drink, I wandered around the Plaza, wondering what I should eat for dinner.  (well! I wasn't hungry at all after the coffee) I stopped by Tom Lee's showroom, and tried out their pianos.  This little 8 year old girl followed me around, and listened to my playing.  She asked me to play a lullaby for her, well I didn't know which one she wanted so I asked her "Do you wanna play piano?" She nodded. So I taught her the "chopsticks song" (Good for little kids).  She's really enthusiastic, and she enjoyed the song very much.  So I taught her the whole piece.  It took her only 30 mins to learn the whole piece.  I was amazed! And it was the first time for me to teach a little girl in public.  (Nobody disturbed us!)    Her mom was next to us while we were playing.  After the little girl (her name is Sherlyn) could master the song, her mom asked me if I am a Christian or not. I said yes, and she's a Christian too.  Well, she didn't tell me which church she's attending, she just told me the name of Sherlyn's church.  (I suppose she's not attending one now) Her mom (Grace) gave me a namecard, and we exchanged our numbers.  Grace said she would call me when they come back from their vacation to Singapore.  I really hope they would call me! If not, I am sure God will keep working according to His own plans.  (Please pray for this family, I don't know what they need, but God does. Pray that God will keep working in this family, I know He is working now.)  No matter how insignificant this may seem to be, I am sure God's working.  At least, this incident brightens up my day, and I couldn't even hide my joy!  And please pray for me, I want to have a clearer picture of God's purpose for me.  To serve children of this age? I'll try working and praying.    Also, several days ago I mentioned I was really upset one night.  I feel much better now, and actually such "pain" has helped me a lot.  Because I got to know I have to face my weaknesses, and I acknowledge God's work in me.  The most important thing is: I got to see how God has changed my life over the years, and how God has blessed me abundantly.  In the past, I felt I didn't have much to say about my testimony, but now I know how God has changed my life and thoughts, and I have stories to share.   It's a day to remember! ^v^

						   I couldn't get up till 11am today.  When I reached HKU, it's already 2pm.  I didn't stay long at HKU cuz I was a little sick and dizzy.  So I left at 5pm.   I took a walk at the mall near home, cuz mom told me to get a watermelon for tonite.  Well, then I went to a Christian bookstore and bought 2 CDs, and went to Blockbuster, got The Lord of the Rings II and III, and Harry Potter II.  Movies that I thought of seeing in the movie theater, but missed. Ugh~  I started watching The Lord of the Rings II when Irene came back from work. She's a big fan of the Lord.  Haha... I still haven't finished yet, still half way done of Lord III. I thought of finishing them off tonight, but have decided not too. I should discipline myself! :)  Just now, I was a little upset by my boss' request of a meeting on Saturday afternoon.  Well, I thought we agreed on the draft to be submitted on Saturday evening, instead of meeting this week.  Honestly, I wasn't really happy about it.  But on second thought, I should thank God for it cuz I can have more time in the evening with my family, also I can finish sooner and go to bed earlier for the next day.  I'll attend the earlier 9:30am sermon this coming Sunday, then I'll join Florence to the Sunday School class on "What about Buddhism".  It's gonna be a loooong day.   My sister Irene's application to UK Law School is confirmed.  Thank you Lord! And thanks to those who prayed for this!   Got my old Alarm Clock fixed finally! I love this alarm clock a lot! :)

						   Talked to Jimmy on the phone for a loooooooong while till 3am last night. I'm reallly exhausted. I hadn't talked on the phone for so long for quite some years. But it was a great chat, cuz I got to know him more.    Woke up at 10am (unexpectedly early!).  Then watched "Lord of the Rings" VCD. (Episode I).  Thumbs up! Surprisingly GOood! Will see II and III as well soon.    I had a nice "date" with Wing today.  We had tea (or meal?) at TST, and did some shopping together. haha.. We were both "criticised" by our family, they thought we were out for a date cuz we dressed up soooo nicely. hoho!!! (NONSENSE! Can't we dress up nicely for ourselves?!:P) Love hanging out with you, Wing! (I'll see if I can upload our pic here!) We should head for the BEACH next time!!   Wanna go to an outlying island next week for some fresh air! ^o^

						   Yea! I talked to Candice for a long time in the morning, cuz as usual, I gave her some updates! I told her the things happened to me during the past weekend.  Interestingly, we experienced quite similar stuff, she too was encouraged by the Sunday Service.  Hallelujah!  I had lunch with Wing, Danieal and their friend, Morris.  We had "yumcha" at Riverside Restaurant. I worked really hard after I returned to my office, and finished the outline for the article.  I'm now ready to dive into the writing bit.  Yes! I wanna get it done by Friday evening, latest Saturday afternoon.  (Please pray for me)  I left office at 6pm, and went to Mr. Ho's home at Mei Foo for piano lesson! I hadn't seen him for nearly three months.  Wow, I played a piece by Rachmaninoff (No. 1 fav) and another one by Gershwin (Thumbs up!) He then gave me this piece by Liszt (Hungarian Rhapsody No.6) for the sightreading practice.  SOOOO challenging! I will work extra hard! (Please pray for me)  After the class, I called Jimmy.  Jimmy played the guitar over the phone! He has improved a lot! I was impressed! Jim! Keep it up! I hope someday we can actually play music together! It'll be a wonderful experience!   It's a terrific day! Thank you Lord!

						   An exciting day, tho' a little hot! :)  In fact, I was pretty upset last night when I went to bed. I sobbed for a while, but God blessed my sleep! I woke up earlier this morning, still feeling a little depressed... so I played the piano for a while before I went to church.  I know I could feel better through worshipping the Lord with other brothers and sisters in Christ, so I was so eager to go to church today.  And indeed, I felt much better after the worship service.  Good that Phoebe also joined our service this morning, tho' Irene couldn't make it.   We had a quick lunch after the service, and went to Cheung Sha Wan to join Jimmy's church (Fuk Chuen Church) special service (which they had prepared for more than 3 months) at 2 30pm about worshipping God.  I was so excited!!! I hadn't been to a Chinese church for some years, and I was really excited today. And I "poured out" myself for the Lord in the worship.  I haven't been so enthusiastic for a loooong loooong time.  I felt I was truly praising God.  They also had a short sermon, tho' Jimmy was "FISHING" and Phoebe was "BORED" then.  I was reminded of what "Faith" is.  I realised I treated Faith too casually... well it was like "lip-service" to me.  In fact, we should evaluate and prepare ourselves well before declaring our faith to follow Jesus.  That's why I kept stumbling along my spiritual path.  (Please pray for me! I don't wanna lose faith again!)

						   I woke up at noon today, cuz I slept at 3am last night.  I met Phoebe and her cousin, Carrie in TST.  Didn't have my lunch till 4pm.  We walked around TST.  Her cousin returned from Aus several weeks ago.    We didn't go anywhere apart from TST, thought of seeing a movie but dropped the idea.    I have this weird feeling today: (Don't laugh at me!hehe) I am a female, and I am happy with that. ("What?") (May be cuz I've been wearing skirt/dress pretty often these days.)  hahahaha ! Well anyway, little sharing here.  Most of you know, I'm kinda boyish in some sense.  I remember I hated myself for being a girl when I was in grade school.  I felt I should be a boy instead.  Some of you might know, I'd been taking up some MALE responsibilites at home like fixing the shelves or being a technician etc. (Just to take care of my family esp. when dad wasn't around)  Sometime ago, I even told my mom "We don't need MEN at home!!!"  hahaha... a real feminist, eh?! But when I was walking home alone tonight, a weird thought came across my mind "I am a female!" hahaha!!  I could wear skirt during the hot hot hot summer days, feels so good when the heat's so strong! hahaha!  I thank God for this: I am a FEMALE! :P  (Extremely important thought to me, because I have to appreciate God's work/plans for me! cuz He has a purpose in everything!)

						   Well, today is a so-so day.  I worked in my office, and had meeting with Stuart.  Haha.. Candice and I walked over to Festival Walk for lunch.  It's a long way from office to there, but we just wanted a better/decent lunch. :P So we walked to Festival Walk under the heat!!! And had lunch at Super Sandwich, then dropped by Park  'N' Shop for some fruits.   At 3pm, I had a meeting with Stuart.  The meeting was alright, tho' I was  a little upset over it (Don't worry, I feel better after taking a walk with Wing, and talking to Candice.   See how nice these buddies are? hehe) ok... but after the meeting, I managed to write around 2 pages (non-spaced) in half an hour.  (STRETCHED my limits) I feel much better now! Will be working on a task over this weekend, so I can concentrate on more writing next week.  Please pray for me, I need endurance.  And I've set a deadline for this task, I really wanna accomplish it.    After work, I had a hair-cut at Festival Walk before dinner time with family.  It's mom's birthday today!!! We celebrated Father's Day as well.  I ate a lot!!! I wasn't so happy at the middle of the dinner because of several reasons.  Btw, my eldest sister is leaving HK sometime around September with her husband, they'll be moving to Beijing.  Suddenly feel my family is breaking into several pieces around the world again.  Um....  My day wasn't as happy as I expected.  Thank God! I am very glad that my colleagues treat me very well all the time.  Suddenly feel very burnt out, and need a break :)

						   Happy to see Wing's back today.  Good that she's learnt a lot from the conference in Ottawa.  I am soo happy to see her again. I missed her a lot.  :)  Lunch with Candice, Wing and Jimmy at "LUK HOP".  Then returned to office and talked to Candice and Wing a bit.  Candice and I sang in the office... heheh. It was sooo fun.  She can sing very well.  :) I love her singing.    I then went to the computer lab, and tried to work on the document for tomorrow.  Jimmy and Camille were there, and I got some updates from Camille.  Hadn't seen Camille for a pretty long while. Nice to see him again.  Hahaha.. these two folks love talking to themselves while surfing the net.  hahahahaha.  And I know something very disgusting (at least to me) about Jimmy, hahahahha didn't know he would do such things ... (Jim, you know wat I mean--- OSMS hahahaha! :P) We couldn't stop laughing over that! hahahha   Then I went to Lok Fu MTR with Jimmy, and took the bus home at Diamond Hill.  Sad sad, had to eat dinner alone again, but was too lazy to cook, so I stuffed myself with the leftovers they had last nite (ie chicken wings) and an apple.  I didn't bother to reheat the "wings" either.  Lazy me!   I talked to Angela over the phone tonite, got some updates from her.  And summarised what happened to me over these months in 5 mins.  hahaha A very short summary.  And I told her my leaving in August as well.  I also talked to Phoebe tonite, I haven't seen her for sometime...  Um... and we hadn't really talked for a long time.  Glad to know she's doing fine, and she's promised that she will definitely wake up for church this Sunday.  (plz pray for her, she's sick) Planning to meet Phoebe on Monday if possible.

						   Met Kerry at Wanchai before she went to work, then wandered around alone from Wanchai to Central to pick up my US visa at 4pm.  It was so crowded!!  Anyway, I got my visa now.  I talked to Irene Tanjono this morning about our meeting in August, I hope we can make it.    While I was walking along the quiet pavement from Wanchai to Central, I sang praises to God. That tune just came naturally while I was walking alone... It was a nice walk with God. hehe I wish I could remember the song I sang this afternoon.  It's beautiful... UGH!!!! Well, in a way that also means "GOD's PRIVATE!" haha....   Went to granny's place for a short while after the visa.  I talked to her a little, she's really upset.  I don't know how to comfort her at all.  I'll be very worried about her when I leave in August.    I watched this musical "MA MA MIA" with Jimmy, Kenneth (Ah Chik) and their friend, Raymond.  It's a nice musical, I enjoyed it! Maybe mostly cuz I didn't hold much expectation before I watched it.   Ok. I bumped into Fanny Lok again at the show.  This is the second time we met in a month.  What a coincidence.  Guess will give her a call sometime next week to catch up a bit.  It's nice to meet with old friends!

						   I woke up early in the morning to apply for the US visa.  It took me more than 2 hours, I went through some tedious procedures which I never expected before.  (The system has changed since the last time I went there 3 years ago, due to the 911 incident)  Anyway, it wasn't a pleasant experience.  But God has shown me AGAIN that He's taking care of me well.    When I arrived at the US consulate in Central, there were sooo many ppl, I could barely fight my way through the crowd.  Then I heard the announcer said "Employees should hand in an employment letter from their company" I was worried.  But I thought "Hey! It took me 1 1/2 hours to get here, I must try to submit my application." So I stayed in line and waited.  I was really worried at that time.  Stupid me! I left my bible at home this morning.  But I have my little verse book with me, so I started memorising those verses while waiting.  Those verses made me feel better, and reminded me that God is taking care of everything, I shouldn't worry too much.  So, I waited patiently, and waited for the interview at the embassy.  The interview was pretty ok, cuz the questions asked were straightforward and easy.  I'll be picking up my visa/passport tomorrow.  I had lunch with Candice in the staff common room, then I met Jimmy in the computer lab.  I was so encouraged cuz he's really/truly been checking my "Bits and Pieces" hahaha. And I realise quite a number of friends are checking my page everyday.  This is really encouraging.    I went home immediately after work, and played the piano for a while before meal time.   My playing tonite was much better than last Thursday!!! Yeah! Then after dinner, I locked myself in the room to have some private time with God.  I sang a lot of songs to Him, and actually attracted Irene to sing along with me.  hehehe,.  I hadnt heard her singing for a long time.    It's been a wonderful day, tho' I'm kinda sleepy/tired.

						   Ok. Funny! Stuart told me I have 12 days Annual Leave. I was shocked.. "What? Didn't I get holidays from you already?" Anyway, he said I should take the annual leave, cuz I deserve it... (Um.. I doubt that). Well, I won't be taking like a "12-day leave", but I may be bringing stuff home to work on, or I'll go somewhere for a retreat when I am really burnt out!   Went to Hung Hom today to meet my friend Chris from my old church.  We had a nice talk, I hadn't met him for like 2 or 3 years.  We went to the Metropolis Plaza (near KCR) for dinner.    I reached home at 9 15pm, was really busy with the visa documents.  I had to fill in a lot of details/info, it took me a long time.    Last nite, I was really excited, cuz I had a really deep talk with Jimmy over MSN, I got to know him a little better.  Feels so good when trusted.

						   Woke up for church in the morning.  The sermon was about "mission".  Praise the Lord! Irene also came to church today, it's her second week! We had lunch together at a Shanghai restaurant in TST, Canton Road.  Well, it's not the worst food I've ever had, but will never go there again. hehehe  We took a walk in TST, then I went home alone.  Talked to mom a bit, and did some cleaning.  I tidied the boxes under my bed, threw out some trash etc.  That's about what I have done so far.    Before I went to bed last night, lot of things (emotions) came to my mind, and I thought of writing it here.. Aiya~ But now, I can't recall what it is! Um...

						   I went to Danieal's Party at Kowloon City today.  I met a couple of her friends, Mr. Huang, Vienna, Martin, Morris.  Candice and I met earlier for her bday cake, and we went to a Karaoke.  Candice sings really well!!!!!  I went home for dinner, and talked to Josephine for a while.  Told mom about my broke up, aiya~ as expected, hahaha She tries to draw other things into it. But I didn't defend myself cuz I know I don't need to. Well Well...I know God has been taking care of me, and He knows what I am up to.  That's enough already! hehe...   I really wanna get a book for deepening my faith, and knowledge of Christ! So I may defend my faith when necessary! Any suggestion?  Jor played violin.. became an audience tonite over the phone.  He's such a funny person, can get soooo "classical" (only through music playing) then all of sudden, will be !@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*() throughout the conversation. hehehe.. but I enjoyed his playing. Thanks!

						   Went to HKU for research again, finished earlier than usual cuz the Bound Journals this time were unexpectedly not as thick as the others!!! So I got to see Shrek 2 again at UA Pacific with Jim.  Then we spent time looking for that cafe (for "SALTY-Lemon 7-up)hahaa, and the French Toast.  It's pretty good, and I tried the "Milk Tea" this time.  We then took the 'DING DING' to Wan Chai, and took the ferry to Whampoa; for a short walk before dinner.  Got a tiny gift from Jim, a "Monkey" soap. hahahaha! Thanks.  I went to the caregroup tonite. Want to study the bible suddenly, like knowing the history, the context, the meanings etc.  May wanna get some help from books, like "Foundational Theology" etc.  I really think this is important to our spiritual growth, because we can defend our faith (as Paul instructed), and it can actually reassure our faith as well (which is more important).  Anyone has suggestions on books that I can read?  Preferably easier ones?   Some more reflections.  I've always been thinking what God wants me to do in the future, but now I have decided, instead of spending time meditating only, I should start strengthening the talents I have now, and ask God to equip me, so I can be ready when His plan is revealed to me.    Agree?  Be my witness guys!  Suddenly feel upset when I got home...Pray for me I need God's help to change my mood swings.

						   Ok.  Office work, needless to say, as usual.  hahaha   Well, then I had a really long lunch with Danieal and Jimmy (he joined later). Then I worked till 5pm, and left with Danieal.  We went to Mongkok, and met mom there to buy "RING" (Her wedding ring).  That's about all for today.  Still... it's a HAPPY day!

						   Peaceful day.  Last night, I stayed up late to prepare for the meeting today. I was really sleepy in the morning when I was on my way to work.  But when I reached my office, I didn't stop working on the revisions, and wrapping the whole thing up till the meeting at 3pm.     My meeting with Stuart was ok.  He's satisfied with the Thesis I wrote, and we have finally compromised on the overall thesis for the article.  So I'll be doing more research, reading and writing before our meeting next Friday.    I left office at 5 30pm, reached home at 6 30pm.  I practised piano for a short while, I defintely, absolutely need more practice. Made Jim played his guitar over the phone, I enjoyed it.(tho' only chords hehe!)  Thanks! Cuz it's music  Been thinking of what spiritual gifts God has given me.  um...  Candice didn't come to work, may be she's still sick. (Plz pray for her)  Found something nice from Wing's office, a poem to share with you. (Can be both man and woman):  Strong Woman vs Woman of Strength   A strong woman works out every day to keep her body in shape...  but a woman of strength kneels in prayer to keep her soul in shape...   A strong woman isn't afraid of anything...  but a woman of strength shows courage in the midst of her fear...   A strong woman won't let anyone get the best of her...  but a woman of strength gives the best of her to everyone...   A strong woman makes mistakes and avoids the same in the future...  a woman of strength realizes life's mistakes can also be God's blessings and capitalizes on them...   A strong woman walks sure footedly... but a woman of strength knows God will catch her when she falls...   A strong woman wears the look of confidence on her face...  but a woman of strength wears grace...   A strong woman has faith that she is strong enough for the journey...  but a woman of strength has faith that it is in the journey that she will become strong...   (Writer: Unknown)

						   I was so sleepy throughout the day, and was still a little sad about Casper.  um...  I know he's with God now, but I just feel a little weird, and have a lot of mixed feeling about life.  um...  I didn't start my day well at first.  I didn't know what the text was about even after reading through 70 pages.  I have difficulty understanding the concepts in the book.  Good that Jimmy came along, and we had a chat in the cafeteria. It was a nice sharing about our childhood.  (Fun to know we have similar experiences! :P)I managed to write a page after the chat (with RACHMANINOFF playing in my office,hehe).  well well... I feel I am disturbing Jim a little too much.  (Sorry Jim if u're reading this)    Thought of having dinner with Danieal at her place, but couldn't make it cuz I have loads to do tonite.  And I must finish them, I don't wanna leave these things undone till the end of the week.  I wanna enjoy my weekend with my family. And most of all, I wanna prep well for tomorrow's meeting with Stuart.  Sorry Danieal!    Candice is still sick, I hope she'll recover soon.  Her cough is serious!!! (Pray for her plz)  OK. Exciting thing.  After my meeting with Sam last nite, I am now FULLY CHARGED!!! And am ready to begin the plans I've made throughout these weeks.  Jimmy and I have just started the "Reading bible plan".  We'll be monitoring each other from now.  We don't have any preliminary plan yet, but we've just started reading Ecclesiastes today, basically for his preparation for the "contest" in his church next week, so it'll be some kinda "trial week".  We aim at finishing Ecclesiastes and 1,2 Corinthians in 8 days (so we'll be reading 5 chapters a day independently), it's not a lot.  I'm confident we'll make it.  After these three books, we'll be devising a plan for "Reading the bible in a year".  Plz pray for us, we need patience and perseverence, cuz it's a year-long commitment!   At last, I received the Visa-documents from OU.  Funny, when I was worried this morning, I called Angelica and asked for her help to check with ISFS Graduate Office about my I-20 (visa).  Then I received it after work tonight.  Seems that God is telling me "Don't worry".  What a coincidence! Just like the night when I talked to Irene Tanjono two weeks ago, I got God's reply immediately.  Thank you Lord! I really should trust you completely.  I had a chat over the phone with Phoebe after work, she's not so satisfied with work. (Plz remember her in your prayers) She needs patience and wisdom to handle her relationships with her colleagues.  Um... after receiving the visa documents, I feel I'll miss you all a lot.  Especially those who've walked with me through my ups and downs, those who've given me "their ears", those who love me, those who care about me, those who are tolerant when I go grumpy... Thank you! I love you all! XOXO  Needa get back to work again. :)

						   Office work is again as usual.  Nothing much to say about it today.  Managed to read two chapters from a difficult book.  (Not so chewable in fact, I need more time on that).  Went to Taiwanese Restaurant for lunch with Candice, had a nice lunch with her.  We talked about a lot of things as usual.  I am really thankful for having Candice as my nice, sweet officemate all the time.  Her bf was so sweet; he picked her up (Surprise!) from work.  He wouldn't be able to meet Candice, if we left a minute earlier. hahhaha!   I met Sam Jr. at Festival Walk after work today, around 6pm.  We had a wonderful chat.  At first, I felt kinda weird, afterall, we hadn't met for two years nearly.  hahaha... But, I enjoyed the talk very much (I did most of the talking), I shared with him my experiences with God, and how God has blessed me abundantly. Our conversation managed to loosen up quickly.  I'm happy to know that his church in Tuen Mun is growing fast.  We can see God is really using youth and children in His Great Works. (Let's pray that God will strengthen the church, and give more oil to the future young leaders!!)  It's nice to see Sam again, cuz we can see each other's growth in Christ, and the different stages that we are going through in God's care. I feel strengthened up after talking to him about my future plans, and my desire to serve God.  He suggested I join the prayer meeting.  I may join the one on June 17th, 04.  PRAY PRAY PRAY!!!!!   Sam Jr told me that Casper Lee passed away last summer.  I was shocked. He died of leukemia.  It's sad to know that he's left us now, but we acknowledged the work he has done for God while he was with us, and we're happy to know that he's now with God in heaven.  I can recall the time when I visited him at QE hospital 7 years ago.  I remember 4 years ago, I bumped into him at Mcdonalds (YMT) where he gave me his number, I didn't give him a call.  (That was the last time I saw him)  Guys! Never assume you'll have 70-80 years of life, you never know what will happen next minute.  Afterall, your time schedule isn't held by you, but by God. We should always treasure the time we have on earth, and take care of each other in fellowship.  But we shouldn't fear "death" either, cuz God is in control of our "schedule".  Most of all, Jesus died on the Cross and resurrected.  Death cannot conquer Him! We should continue to treasure each day that God has given us, and love one another.  Afterall, that's the greatest commandment!!!  Let's continue to grow in the Lord!

						   First, I must say, I am very happy because Irene attended church this morning with JoLee and me.  I'm very excited about it cuz we (the three of us) hadn't gone to church together for a decade!! That's truely amazing.  And I had never thought I would be attending church with them again.  Thanks to the Lord!!  At last, JoLee, Florence and Jimmy got to meet! Hahaha.  They've always heard about each other from me, but had never met till this morning.  And I got to meet Joan again since Jo's admission 2 years ago.  Joan is a very friendly and gentle girl.  :)  After the sermon, Joan, JoLee, Ron, Jimmy and I went to a Chinese Restaurant in Admiralty for lunch.  I had a better "thousand layers cake" finally! :P  We then went to Joan's home for a while, and I saw the rest of "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" which I somehow couldn't finish last year.  It's a good one!! Then we went to UA Admiralty for "The Day After Tomorrow", it's average (not anything that I would want to see for a second time...um...) Apparently, Jimmy and I weren't so satisfied with it. hehe.    This week's sermon was about serving the church/community.  um.. I am thinking of taking up some responsibilites as well, to offer my life to God.  May try the "youth volunteer" or the children ministry.  Or simply teaching English over the summer...   Thankyou Lord! I've had a nice rest today, tho' it's rainy.  :)

						   Went to office in the morning for my document.  Great that my colleague, Candice was there with me.  Both of us have to work harder for the coming weeks. Then I left office around 1 30pm. Saw a Korean movie "Windstruck" at Festival Walk.  I don't really like this movie cuz I feel the story is disastrous towards the end.   Went home for dinner.  Everyone's here except granny.  We had a lot of great food.  Big fish, chicken, veggie, TONG BOR ROU, Egg shrimp... Haven't had dinner at home for nearly a week.    Have to work really hard tonite, wanna get it done b4 tomorrow's sermon.   :) Thanks to God! Had a peaceful day.

						   An exciting and sunny day today.    Ok.  I went to Jimmy's secondary school open day, and was fascinated by the creativity that the students possess.  I visited their laboratories, you know, with all the artwork, science demonstrations etc.  I was amazed!!!!! WoW!!!! It's really fun.  I got to see Jimmy's funny pics there. hahaha! Funny thing was: we could still find the same pic that Jimmy took in some occasion (Flagselling?), after so many years, still on the board!!! HaHaha.  I had a great time in Tai Po.    Then, I went to caregroup meeting.  HAHA.. Florence was amazed when I managed to recall nearly 90% of the names in the group! I didn't know I have such a good call either.  :P I was so excited cuz even though not a lot of ppl knows this site, I discovered somebody is reading my online-journal!! Hahaha!  At the caregroup meeting, we were made to answer 1 out of 12 questions asked by other members.  Well, wen I received my list, my mind was totally blank.  cuz I dont know the answers to any of them.  This shows that I don't know myself well enough, tho' the questions are pretty easy/ neutral.  How to say, kinda personal and plain facts.  um...  Avis (hope I've spelt it correctly) asked me the questions on my list after the discussion, but I really couldn't answer any of them.  I wasn't trying to hide, but I just didn't know the answers.  Honestly, I felt very strange (astonished as well) at that moment, you see what I mean? The feeling of "distance"? ugh! How should I put it... Sb help me out with this.    But I feel that's also good in the sense that I should rely on God more, cuz He created me... He knows me inside-outside. I should actually begin with asking God about "myself".

						   Some showers today, but most of the time SUNNY!! YEA!! I love the blue skies.  I went to the TAIWANESE restaurant in SHAW campus for lunch, with Wing, Danieal and Jimmy (He joined us after his interview).  Then wen went to Danieal's new room cuz she's just moved to the 17th floor. Apparently, she's still pretty overwhelmed by her new room. haha  It's so hot today. So we "crawled" back to our office after then.  I was kinda lazy :P didn't finish what I planned today.  Intended to go to the library for the ILL books, but was tooo lazy to go there, so I went to the computer lab, hahaha and DISTURBED Jimmy while he's trying to do some job hunt.    I left office with Wing around 6 30pm, and we took a walk at Festival Walk.  Then I went to Kowloon Bay, thought of seeing a movie there.  In the end, I had dinner with Boss Lee, and had a good chat on my belief.  Tho' I felt I was only babbling all night, I hope he understands what I was trying to say.  I talked to Angelica this morning over the phone, it keeps me happy throughout the day.  I talked to Irene Tanjono in the evening, I had a great chat with her as well.  My sister, Irene, she's very stressful now.  There's some problems with her application to the Law School in UK. I hope everyone (who reads this message) can pray for her as well.

						   I had a busy in office.  I had loads to do.  And I received a lot of phone calls from both my travel agency and friends.  Busy Busy Busy day.    I was so stressed with work that I couldn't even concentrate on my readings.  So I wrote to my boss and asked for a couple of days more to work on the document.  He let me go. Thank God.  I'll pay extra effort!   I went to see a movie "Eternal Sunshine" with Jimmy at AMC.  I guess too close to the screen, I feel sooo dizzy now.  We bumped into Stuart tonite, I didn't greet him cuz I didn't wanna embarass him and his gf.  See? I'm so considerate! haha . Well, anyway it wasn't a big deal.  Met Irene and JoLee at the station, we got back by a taxi together.  Thank God! Cuz I still feel a little dizzy with a headache.  I received an email from Angelica last nite, she gave me her cell phone no.  I miss her so much, and it's so nice to hear from her again.  Angelica is always my best roomate forever.  I miss you so much.  I wish I had a pic of her that I could post on my photo album.  When can we meet again?

						   Worked in the office as usual.    I left office with Wing at 5 30pm today, we went to Danieal's party.  Tracy (a cute Year 2 girl) was there too, together with some mainland Chinese students.  We went to the Karaoke room in their dormitory.  Wing and I stayed for about 45 mins only, cuz we have loads to do, and I need to have dinner with mom, Irene and Derek.    Wing and I went to Festival Walk for a while after Danieal's party.  We couldn't get anything.    I had Hot Pot tonite.  (Hot Pot in summer!)  Received a beautiful postcard. It brightens me up.  I love the flowers on it.  It's really beautiful.  Wish they were real!

						   Getting to my last day of work.&nbsp; Busy xeroxing articles and chapters from books.&nbsp; Natalie came to BU today.&nbsp; We had lunch together and she&nbsp;gave me much help in the&nbsp;cleaning.&nbsp;hahaha.&nbsp; I don't have much in my office, just a small paper bag to take home.&nbsp; These 10 months passed so quickly.&nbsp; Realised everything's under God's plan... I enjoyed my time working in the office.&nbsp; I will miss my colleagues: Wing, Candice, Danieal and now Phoebe (nextdoor)   So amazing, when God gradually reveals His plans to me.&nbsp; Why He placed me here etc.&nbsp;   I didn't go to caregroup meeting today.&nbsp; I spent some time with my family at home.&nbsp; I asked my mom to&nbsp;paint something on a plain T-Shirt.&nbsp; She did it quite beautifully.&nbsp; Will be getting more such plain shirts for her to paint.&nbsp; I must say, her painting is getting better and better.&nbsp;   &nbsp;

						   God has planned many wonderful things in my life.&nbsp; He's so good that sometimes it's hard for me to accept what He's&nbsp;planned for me.&nbsp; I wonder "Do I deserve all this?"   I think it needs more effort for us to accept/forgive ourselves.&nbsp; Sometimes, our "inner selves" may remind/condemn&nbsp;us of our past.&nbsp;But God's grace is sufficient for us.&nbsp;   I&nbsp;don't quite exactly know&nbsp;how to describe my feelings now.&nbsp; But I really feel that God's been&nbsp;good all the time.&nbsp;And God has shown His love for me in many ways.&nbsp; I gotta do something for Him in response to His love and grace.  &nbsp;

						   Morning: Went to HKU library for research.&nbsp; While waiting for Stuart, I bumped into my old DGS mate--- Suanne.&nbsp; She's still as humurous as before. haha Nice! I got her cell no. will call her next week!   After HKU, I returned to my office, had lunchbox in Wing's room. She's super busy (please have her in your prayers).&nbsp;   I tidied my folders and sorted some of the articles.&nbsp; Will be working hard on the annotated bibliography from tomorrow.&nbsp; I met Jimmy (again!) after work, we did some quick&nbsp;shopping together.&nbsp; hahaha.&nbsp;   Got home late for dinner... then spent a long time in the kitchen preparing Tabouli.&nbsp; Hope it works! :P

						   Started work at 1pm.&nbsp; But didn't really do much.&nbsp; Sarah came to my office and we had a chat before lunch with Wing and Danieal.&nbsp; I'm soooo sleepy.   Jimmy came to me in the afternoon.&nbsp; We did a test together.&nbsp; We're kinda amazed by the results.&nbsp; The test's about "Spiritual Gifts".&nbsp; I'm a "Pastor" type and he's a "Missionary" Um.. need more thoughts on that.&nbsp; (And defintely need more prayers, agree?)&nbsp;   Went to piano after work.&nbsp; I nearly fall asleep during the lesson, while standing!!!! Can u believe how sleepy/tired I am?? hahahaha&nbsp;   Friendster---I never thought it could work in such a way.&nbsp; I' ve been talking to this person called PATRICK for several months really inconsistently.&nbsp; He asked me questions on my job, but I wasn't really interested at all.&nbsp; So&nbsp;I sorta ignored him for a while, but one day he sent me a message again... and it's then I checked his pictures and realised he's a long old friend of mine.... (guess 10 years ago)&nbsp; I wasn't so certain at first, but&nbsp;after several msgs&nbsp;over friendster, I realised he really IS the Patrick back in junior high!&nbsp;HAHA!!!! So&nbsp;excited!!&nbsp; Funny! He asked if I did plastic surgery somewhere... apparently he only had that old boyish image of mine on his head! hehehe... Even more hilarious, he thought I was a lesbian then... hahahahahaha!!!!!! Surprisingly, he remembers our old church mates, tho' we've left that church manyx3 years already.&nbsp; Will be arranging a meeting with him and the others (if possible)&nbsp; before I leave.&nbsp;   Funny Professor! I talked to a professor in my office after lunch.&nbsp; She knows Wing and I are leaving for Canada and US soon, so she sorta gave us some "advice" today.&nbsp; She said we should go crazy when we're not "home", cud go dating, pubbing, clubbing... for "fun".&nbsp; Well, we maintained our nice smile on our face but didn't make much comment.&nbsp; Um... obviously I don't quite agree.&nbsp; Is clubbing truly fun? If yes, I would have done it several years ago.&nbsp; Also, I don't think those activities are fun at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't wanna get a hangover every week, or wake up late during the day realizing the sun is setting.&nbsp; That's no fun at all with all the harm done to our bodies.&nbsp; Anyway, it doesn't make much sense to me.&nbsp; I prefer a more leisurely lifestyle, experiencing the nature.&nbsp; haaha I remember I had this "weird" (to some of u) habit of talking to the&nbsp;trees when I walked along that long path to my department every morning, and paused my steps to check on the birds, squirrels, trees and flowers.&nbsp; Or walked on the nice damp grass barefooted with my roomate (Angelica) in May... and had nice walks with her in the cold.&nbsp;&nbsp;

						   Late for Sunday School... hehehe... talked about Spiritual Gifts. It's pretty useful! And I got to discover something new about me that I had never thought of.&nbsp; Will be examining it further.  Been a nice day! Had lunch with Natalie and her sister, Kammie.&nbsp; Took them on a tram (their first ride, surprisingly).&nbsp; Then met Jimmy somewhere around MongKok but then travelled all the way to Chai Wan by MTR again--- NOTHING THERE!!! We then went to Tai Koo for a long walk.&nbsp; Amazed by&nbsp;him! He's getting to know me TOOO well.  &nbsp;

						   Got my internet fixed finally!!   Friday (23 July 04) Lunch with Danieal, Wing and Jimmy at LUP HOP, tried JA CHEUNG LO MEEN! Had a nice long chat with Sarah in the afternoon.&nbsp; Tho' I don't entirely agree with what she said, she's given me much courage and has raised my self-esteem somehow.&nbsp; Jimmy joined us after his meeting (or in the middle of his meeting haha) Anyway, I had a great time.&nbsp; I also talked to Phoebe nextdoor for a short while.  Had dinner with mom and dad, didn't go to fellowship this week.&nbsp; I was surprised when I realised they're waiting for me for dinner.&nbsp; It's a peaceful dinner.&nbsp; I played piano for a long time after dinner.&nbsp; And talked to Jim over the phone till "dunno when" haha.  Saturday (24 July 04)  Nothing much happened today.&nbsp; Woke up at 1pm, played the piano after stuffing myself up with two croissants! Yummy! HAHAHA... Cleared my book shelf and tidied my desk! Had dinner with family.&nbsp; Another peaceful day! :)&nbsp; Got a call from Florence.&nbsp; Thanks Flo! I am really alright.&nbsp; Already put you down for 11th Aug,04.&nbsp; We surely need a good chat before I leave! Your hug last Sunday gave me great comfort! Thanks!   Did the "Spiritual Gifts Test" for Sunday School tomorrow.&nbsp; It's a hard one!! It took me quite sometime to finish it.&nbsp; But I'm sure it worths the effort!!   Thanksgiving: Feels nice to be accepted completely.&nbsp; Sometimes I really doubt if I deserve it or not, but God is always good and gives me things more than I deserve.&nbsp;

						   Didn't write my journal these two days cuz of poor internet connection.  Wednesday: 21 July 04 Had a great time after work.&nbsp; Quite a few showed up at the gathering.&nbsp; Vonne, Phoebe, Jenny, Judy, Jimmy, Danieal, Elisa, Wing and Angela.&nbsp; It didn't quite work as I expected, but we had fun.&nbsp;We went to Kowloon City afterwards for supper, and I went home with Angela.&nbsp;  Thursday: 22 July 04 (Jimmy's birthday) Happy Birthday! I went on a retreat with Jimmy, we reached TAI O (a place&nbsp;I can't even point out from the map :P) at 4pm and stayed there till 7 30pm.&nbsp; It's a beautiful day (unexpectedly!)&nbsp; We were very worried about the weather the night before.&nbsp; Thank God! It's an amazingly beautiful day! It's really nice to go on a retreat in the countryside! (and have a nice lunchbox! :P)  Had a wonderful time with God!  "We love because he first loved us." (1 John 4:19)

						   Woke up at 9am this morning, scribbled the melody of the most recent song... but haven't finished with the chords yet.&nbsp; Returned to office at noon, had lunch with my colleagues: Wing and Phoebe; Jimmy joined as well.&nbsp;   Didn't do anything, cuz I have taken my annual leave.&nbsp; Went to see a movie instead.&nbsp; hahaha!! :P  &nbsp;  After that, I went to Elaine's home as scheduled, for the potluck! (Ugh~ I didn't get any food! :P) Anyway, it's nice to see these old folks again.&nbsp; Who joined? Elaine, Vonne, P.Koo, Fanny, Prudence and Anna (unexpectedly).&nbsp; Left at 10 30pm.. tooo tired!  &nbsp; Prayer Request:&nbsp; I am worried about tomorrow's event --- our&nbsp;"JAM".&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm afraid the residence&nbsp;hall may not&nbsp;be able to&nbsp;accomodate&nbsp;more than 5 ppl.&nbsp;May need a better place! Please pray for us.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;

						   Long piece! But nice one! &nbsp; After much tears and laughs over the weekend, I'm back to normal today.&nbsp;&nbsp; I woke up at 10am this morning after a super long chat with Jim last night.&nbsp;(ZzzzZzzz!)&nbsp; I hurried to Wan Chai (IRD) to do the tax clearance stuff, and reached my office at 2 30pm.&nbsp; I had lunch in Wing's room (Danieal's back), I shared and prayed with Wing after lunch.&nbsp; Left office at 6pm for piano.&nbsp; My piano teacher said I got a talent in composition, after listening to my latest piece.&nbsp; Um... ahahaha  &nbsp; &nbsp;

						   Today is Judy's Birthday! Happy Bday!!!  &nbsp;  I went to church in the morning; missed Sunday School, um... I attended the&nbsp; worship service.&nbsp; This morning's service was very special to me.&nbsp; I love Psalm 66.&nbsp; After the service, I met Florence outside the theater, I couldn't hold my tears when I hugged her.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Thought of having lunch with Elaine and Vonne, but I'd rather be alone for a while. So I took a walk alone, and bought a new backpack.&nbsp; Then I met up with Jimmy first for lunch, Judy and Jenny joined a little later after busying with their own things.&nbsp; We walked around Pacific Place and went to Hong Kong park.&nbsp; It's a nice walk.&nbsp; Then I had dinner with Judy and Jenny in TST.  &nbsp;  Note to Florence: Thanks! I know I'm in your prayers!  &nbsp; Thanksgiving: The Associate Professor, Dr. William Wong I mentioned two days ago has returned home safely.&nbsp; Thank you Lord!

						   I woke up early in the morning to meet Livia, cuz she taught me some composition basics.&nbsp; It rained so heavily in the morning.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I managed to learn how to "improvise" (still need practice). &nbsp; Then I went to Wing's fellowship, followed by violin lesson in Tai Wai.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Something unpleasant happened at night, and I still need time to get over with it.&nbsp;  &nbsp; And somebody (you know who you are) apparently has forgotten our date tomorrow after church!! um...&nbsp; hehe  &nbsp; PLease pray for me!

						   Typhoon day! No work! I stayed at home all day.  &nbsp;  I woke up at 11am and watched one VCD "When Harry Met Sally"; an old 90s&nbsp;movie.&nbsp; It's pretty nice, hahahaha cracked me up.&nbsp; Then I was too sleepy, so I went to bed again for an evening nap.&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt "paralysed" in my sleep again... may be I'm too exhausted, and I haven't&nbsp;full recovered from my flu yet.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  When I woke up at&nbsp;6pm, I realised JoLee's not at home.&nbsp; I was soo worried,&nbsp;I kept yelling her name.&nbsp; You know, the wind was so strong around that time, and&nbsp;was raining cats and dogs!!&nbsp;Where was she?? She's nuts to go out at that time!! I called her bf, he told me Jo's out for food! I was so mad when I heard that "How could he let her leave home in such weather condition?? Don't they know how to take care of themselves??? They should stay home!" Then my mom called from Shenzhen (she went there with her friends), and she told me she would be taking a taxi home. I was like "WHAT? NO!! YOU should stay where you are! It's dangerous to come home now!" Well, she didn't listen to me.&nbsp; I was so freaked out at that moment that I broke into tears.&nbsp; No one seemed to understand my worries&nbsp;at that time.&nbsp; So I locked up&nbsp;myself in&nbsp;my&nbsp;room, and prayed to God.&nbsp; "Please take them home safely".&nbsp; Thank God! They both arrived home safely.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  While I was hiding in my room, I checked the internet and realised an Assistant Professor (Dr. William Wong) is missing in Beijing.&nbsp; At that moment, I totally understand how Wong's family members are feeling now! Feeling miserable and desolate (tho' compared to theirs, mine is nothing) Please pray for them.&nbsp; May God grant them peace and comfort.&nbsp; Then, I did a lot of things.&nbsp; I found comfort from writing my diary, reading God's words, praying and singing praises to God.&nbsp; I even wrote down the melody of the song I composed with Vonne last Monday.&nbsp; And wrote&nbsp;another new song tonight (only part of it tho')&nbsp;&nbsp;I can find real comfort from God.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I'll be meeting Livia tomorrow morning to talk about the song&nbsp; I wrote, and ask for some feedbacks and help.&nbsp; Thanks Livia for your help! You really have an extraordinary gift from God!! Keep up your great work! And be courageous and strengthened in the Lord always!  &nbsp;  My eyes are so swollen up&nbsp;and heavy...&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Found this&nbsp;wonderful piece tonite: &nbsp;   When the world falls down around you and a prayer will see you through Say an extra prayer for someone Who may need it more than you. &nbsp; For who knows whose hearts are breaking In the silence of the night Just that extra prayer you whisper May help someone to see the light.   Every time you help a stranger With an extra prayer or two You are building extra blessings That will always come back to you.   Submitted by Pat Wheeler

						   I left office with Wing today at 5pm to meet her friend Elisa, who plays violin.  We're goin to meet next Wednesday with Candice, Vonne etc. to play music together after work.  Elisa will be playing the violin for us.  I love strings!!!!  I had a great time with Wing and Elisa tonight. It's a good way to break the ice between Elisa and me before actually playing next Wednesday.  She's a sweet girl! I can't wait at all.  It's gonna be really fun!!!! Don't know how many people will be joining us that day.    In fact, I don't know what we should play that day, so I've chosen some easy and common songs! Songs that most people may have heard of at least.    I wish I could record the process that day hahaha!!   Meeting with Elisa and Wing tonight was good cuz I could as well break away from my worries and burdens.  I feel great!   Thanksgiving: As you know, Angelica has found me a place to live.  Still confirming.  Thank God! I can see God is making way for me.  Will be sharing this after everything's confirmed!   Last night I had a short chat with Jolee, I shared with her my concerns and burdens.  I'm very glad that she's making effort to be attentive to my needs! Cuz she switched off the tv when I was talking to her; to give me her fullest attention.  I really appreciate your effort.  Thanks JoLee! (tho' I know you hardly read my online-journal)

						   Working on admin tasks till like 3pm, I could finally take a break from work and started my reading on Kittler "Discourse Network" again.  well, my administrative tasks weren't too heavy, so it didn't take too long.    Jim gave me a call, and I met him in the computer lab. I offered to teach him some basics of music theory, thought he didn't know anything at all, but turned out he might probably know more than I do.  hahahahaha!!! Anyway, I taught him some basics, or better say, I did a very brief review with him.    Went home after a short walk at Festival Walk (unexpected one!) Got really excited about the meeting next week.  Probably will be playing music with friends.  It'll be fun!!  Was busy looking for scores whole at night.    I had a talk with Wing at lunch, and we've decided to pray together 3 times a week.  hahaha.. You know, I'm spontaneous at all times so we started our prayer session immediately after lunch.  It's really cool! Especially Wing and I are leaving really soon, we may need more strength and wisdom to carry out our tasks.  (Please pray for us).  I hope more colleagues and friends will join this short but encouraging prayer session, where we can share our burdens, and be encouraged in the group.  As you know, fellowship is essential to Christians!! I am glad that I have one in the office!! The fellowship I love most at this point of my life.  :P

						   After yesterday's music day, I feel so energetic and "ALIVE"! I can't imagine how my life would be without music.  I do not excel in any particular instrument, I simply enjoy the playing time.  I'm glad that I have music, cuz it's my shelter, or more like my cave somehow, I can just retrieve into that shelter for some moments of silence...  I feel protected by music as I need not talk to anyone while playing/practising, but at the same time, being physically present among people.  I am sure some of you may have similar passion towards music like me.  We may not be great music players but what's more important than enjoying the music you make? or the comfort and peace you gain from it?  Even the humming of a simple tune can keep me happy all day long.  It's as simple as that...   I went home after work, and started playing violin immediately.  After dinner, I played piano and flute.  I played part of Chopin's "Premier Ballade" tonite, Dad said it's pretty nice. :) Tho' I made a lot of mistakes in the playing; wrong notes, wrong beat... I enjoyed my playing. I want to practise hard my violin! Tho' I may take more than a decade to play it in a way that's barely pleasing to others' ears, it worths all the effort.  I'm willing to give it a try.

						   Felt extremely sleepy in the morning, didn't work at all in the office.  I was so tired that I took a long nap on the desk.... and felt "paralysed" hahaha.. So I left office early today at 4pm and went to Vonne's home in Mei Foo.    We planned to play some praise music together, but turned out we composed a song together, from Psalms 25: 4-6.  I'm very determined to learn composition now.  Of course I can't be a professional composer like those music majors, at least I wanna know how they do chords and stuff.. the Basics.  hahaha I got some ideas from my piano teacher today.  Suddenly really wanna join the "course" on music composition which will be held the end of the this month.    After piano, I went to Samuel's home for violin lesson.  He's really patient cuz I'm little slow to learn.  hehehe It's really nice to learn something new.  I feel much better after all these activities.    Nearly forgot: Had a deep chat with Wing at lunch.  We have really similar experience.  Wing~ let's work really hard together!!! We live for God, not for people! We're always precious in God's eyes!!!

						   Didn't write yesterday cuz there's something wrong with the browser.  I've had an overwhelming weekend.    Saturday (10th July 2004): I woke up early in the morning to meet Chris in Tai Wai at 11am, to pick up the violin.  Thought I could start the lesson straight after.  But Samuel was too tired that he slept through the alarm.  Anyway, I managed to have a talk with Chris.  And Thank God, Chris lends me his violin for two years, so I don't have to buy one for the time being. After leaving the violin at home, I met up with Judy at 5pm to attend Jimmy's "debut" at his church in CSW.  Jimmy's first formal service playing at his fellowship meeting.  It's a nice worship time.  I enjoyed it very much.  The theme for the fellowship was about loving each other in our fellowship.  So the songs chosen were mostly about friendship.  I must say, several faces came across my mind: Jimmy, Wing and Candice.  I'm very glad that God has placed these three at this point of my life. Jimmy is always the good co-laborer, who cracks me up from time to time.  Wing is the patient listener, and Candice is the good advisor!  I reflected the time spent with these three.  I am really thankful that God has blessed me by placing them around me.  When I thought about the time spent with them, I realised they give me this feeling of family and fellowship (in the workplace).  I feel I'm back home when I'm working in the office.  That's why I returned to the office during my day offs last week.  After the fellowship, Judy, Jimmy and I went to TST for dinner.  Judy is a friend from university.  The first person I met at Baptist University during my first year.  Glad to see her again! Will be meeting up soon.  After dinner, I met up with the DGS folks: Elaine Chiu, Vonne, Fanny, P.Koo and Prudence.  They haven't changed much.  I was really impressed that Elaine and Fanny remember my favorite flavor of the Mcdonald's sundae-- Caramel (Can't get it anymore! sad~)and Vonne remember the "timing incident" in the girls' bathroom. hahahaha~   I reached home at 1:30 am in the morning, and was struck by an email in the middle of the night.  I received an email from Dr. Beverley Flanigan at Ohio University, which says International Students should stay away from the "River Edge Apt/River Park Towers" because students were being attacked by the "partying undergrads".  I was pretty bothered cuz I didn't wanna spend time to do the search again, and for a split second, I felt really anxious cuz I wanted to be in control! I couldn't bear that moment of 'losing control' over something, that's also why I hurried in searching for an apartment.  But now I know, I should let God take over my life completely.  I guess God has His own plan for me, may be there's some other place which is better for me to lodge, or simply that place isn't good for me to stay.  No matter what, I should rely on God completely, cuz He knows the best!! I guess it's good in a way as I get to learn to rely on God more, and let God takeover my life completely.  Well, more, I can say a little more in my testimony. (Plz pray for me, I need a place to stay at Ohio) I was really upset at first, but Jimmy comforted me over the night, and tried to make jokes to crack me up.  We kept talking on the phone till 6am.  I basically stayed up all night, and attended church sermon at 11 15am this morning.  Jimmy caught a cold over the night.  Sorry! (Plz pray for him)  Sunday (11 July 2004): I went to church.  Feel pretty exhausted cuz I didn't sleep the whole night.  Met up with Vonne and Natalie at HK CONVENTION CENTRE, had lunch together.  Vonne and I spent some good time together in Admiralty.  Thought I could have violin lesson today, but Samuel couldn't make it again.  Anyway, I had a good chat with Vonne, and have decided to play music together tomorrow after work.  It'll be fun! Cuz the lesson was cancelled, I went to SSP to meet Jimmy for dinner.  We ended up attending a sermon at St. Andrew's Church in the evening, cuz he missed the service at his church in the morning. The sermon at St. Andrew's was a little longer than we expected.  I enjoyed the worship time more than the sermon itself because I was too tired.  Apparently, I didn't know what's going on at the sermon until the short-prayer time that we prayed for each other in groups of 4.    I'm soo sleepy now.

						   Guys, Prayers are so important especially to Christians.    I went to caregroup today, Jacqi (a girl from Australia) is experiencing something that I wont be able to cope with.  It's not too good to disclose what's happening with her without her permission.  But I ask everyone who reads this message to utter a short prayer to God for her now, she defintely needs God's comfort and strength to walk through this rugged path.    I had a chat with Wing, I'm glad that she's opening up to me.  And I got to know her little better.  Well, I feel better opening up to her as well, as I shared with her my recent 'troubles' (well, very trivial tho') I defintely feel better after telling her, I feel my burden is somehow unloaded, cuz I don't have to keep it to myself only.  And she's given me a lot of advice and encouragement! hehehe...  Thanksgiving:  I've told some of you that I'm going to play violin but I don't have one (and don't wanna spend money to buy it yet) Anyway, I'll start my first violin day tomorrow morning!! Several hours ago, I was still worried about not being able to get a violin for practice.  While I was telling JoLee about it, I remember I should pray to God.  God answered my prayer shortly! Chris has a violin that he's not using now.  So, I borrowed it from him for a month! I will be picking it up tomorrow morning, right before class starts! YEAH!!!! Thanks to God and Chris! Once again, God provides!

						   Hey God provides.  I am thankful that Phoebe lent me her cell phone. It's not working perfectly but it's still good.  And today, God provided me with another cell phone.  Boss' friend has a spare cell phone that she doesn't need for the time being, so I'm using hers instead.  Thankyou God!  I had lunch with Wing and a new colleague called Phoebe.  (hahahaha! "Phoebe" is AROUND ME). She's started working last month, but we never had a chance to have lunch together.  Nice having lunch with her. We ICQed in the office for a while.  Wing introduced her friend (Elisa) to me through ICQ.  She added me this afternoon and we started chatting.  I bombarded her with all these questions on MUSIC.  hahaha Cuz I know she's a big fan of music, who goes to concerts all the time.  (May be a good companion)  Anyway, I know she plays violin, and we've agreed to meet next Wed/ Thurs with Wing for dinner, then stop by Tom Lee to check out the music scores so that we could have a duet sometime.  We haven't decided what to play yet, will do that soon.  If possible, I would like to find a piece that somebody can sing as well ---- of course I'm thinking of Candice.  hahahaha That'll be fun...  Also, I've noticed something really hilarious (at least to me) .. Wing has been influenced by me.  Ok... most of you may know that I have this SUPER-HYPER personality, never stop moving... hahahaha! I realised Wing has picked this "gesturing" from me, she talks with her body moving around.  I noticed that especially when we were walking to the bathroom this afternoon, I caught her moving her hands unintentionally.... hahahaha which is apparently from me!!!!!!! Sooo funny!!!!

						   Work.... as usual!   Well, finally, we're ready to send out the documents to the 9 publishers.  I hope one/some of them will be interested in this piece.  Tho' it's not written by me, I still hope it'll get published/accepted at least.    After work, thought of posting those documents at Lok Fu, but didn't have time to do it.  So I went home and took a rest before going to TST for dinner with Phoebe.  Phoebe lent me her old cell phone, tho' it's not working perfectly, I think it's good enough for a month.  hehehe.. Great! I don't have to waste my bucks on another cell phone.    I called Yusuke today, haven't called him for quite sometime.  I was a little worried about him after he called the other day. Anyway, nice to know that he's doing fine.  COngrats!!!! He's got a high score in TOEFL, a very goood score! COngrats! Something he's really proud of now! Keep it up! Well, he's now "half" in the top tier Japanese Grad School now (with this score) Keep rolling, Yusuke! You're almost there!!   Thanksgiving:  (1) Cell phone from Phoebe: I was so worried cuz I don't wanna spend money on another mobile phone.  I know I need one before I leave HK in August.  Thanks to the Lord! I've got one from Phoebe!   (2) New York: I was wondering if I should spend money on hotel during my transit stay in New York.  I was worried especially yesterday when I confirmed my tickets.  Well I still haven't made up my mind where to lodge, but I am sure God has heard my prayer, and will be planning the best for me.  Cuz He's been showing me different options.... all I need to do is PRAY!! Will keep you informed!   Thank you Lord!   "Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear.  Is not life more important than food, and the body more important than clothes? Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them.  Are you not much more valuable than they? Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life?" (Matthew 6:25-27)  Today I also read about Jacob in Genesis 32.  He wrestled with God and asked God to bless him.  Then God made Jacob limb, so that he'd be more dependent on God.  I shared some of my thoughts on that with Wing yesterday.  We talked about my exchange year in Ohio.  We both feel that God has deliberately planned this 2nd visit to OU for me.  God is like giving me a second chance to live a different "life" from last time.  When I first went to Ohio which was three years ago, I dare say, I brought quite a big sum of money with me.  Well, I still tried to spend less for the first couple of months, but after that...um... Anyway, this time I'll be living on a tight budget.  I must say, I don't even know if I could sustain my living with such money.  Well, afterall, I don't wanna ask my family for so much, especially I've graduated for more than a year now.  Well guys! I think the verses in Matthew and Jacob's story reminded me something very important:  (1) God will take care of us. (2) By making us "poor", we'll rely on God more.  Note: being "poor", not only financially, can be other aspects.  Anyway, this shows that I gotta rely on God more. And I believe God is showing me his blessings.  Well, afterall, God has provided me this Masters education.  Tuition waiver + assistantship, which worths around HK$ 300,000 a year.  I am sure He'll take care of the rest.  Please continue to pray for me!!

						   Nobody can reach me now, my cell phone has broken down.    Got my flight tickets today.  Leaving HK on 18th Aug. Transit in Japan and stop over New York for several days before heading Columbus, Ohio.  It's going to be a long journey.   Felt weird when I received the flight coupons; several faces came across my mind.  sob sob*

						   Very hot and stuffy day again, got loads to do in the office.  Luckily could finish everything by 5 and had a happy time at piano class.  As usual, I have a "competition" with my piano teacher.  He said I won tonite, he didn't expect I could play so many songs for him.  Well, I was sick Saturday so I didn't go anywhere but stayed at home.  Naughty me, didn't take the chance to sleep more but instead practised my piano.   My cell phone is driving me crazy, I can't charge the battery at all!! Aiya~

						   A busy shopping day basically.   I had lunch with Josie, Irene, Jo and Mom in Central after sermon.  Then we did some shopping together.  Mom got me "thousand-layer cake" and "Ma Lai cake" for me this morning.  Yummy yummy, finished the 1000-layer at night.  Save the other for tomorrow's breakfast.  Bumped into Miriam at ECC when I left. Will be meeting her on Saturday with P.Koo and Elaine probably.  I went to Shatin to meet Natalie for tea.  She did some shopping with me.  It's a nice afternoon, and we went to a Japanese Restaurant for dinner.  She has grown up a lot! She's no longer the kid I tutored 4 years ago.  Time really flies, Natalie is growing up, and I am getting older too.  Well, luckily I can still mix well with ppl of that age, haha! :P  It's nice talking to Natalie, cuz she brightens me up with her stories and experiences.  I feel the liveliness in her.  It's nice to be with youth of that age, feels so good talking with them.    Nicely sheltered from the rain!

						   I woke up in the morning and went to "YUMCHA" with my mom and sister.  I only stayed at the restaurant for 15 mins, cuz I was so dizzy and sick... I went home immediately.    Well, I couldn't fall asleep so I decided to play the piano. I felt better after playing for an hour.  I played piano with JoLee for a while, "Pachelbel Canon in D" --Familiar? It's so popular these two years.    Then I took an evening nap at 5 - 7pm.  It's a terrible nap, felt paralysed! ugh!   Yusuke called me last night, but I couldn't get his call.  I hope he's doing fine.  He'll be taking the Grad school exams from next month, please pray for him.    Congrats to Jim! Jim's leaving for UK the end of this month being an ambassador. He's been expecting it for long. So jealous of him now! ugh~ Have fun there.    Received a call suddenly this afternoon, a call from P.Koo.  Have lost contact with her since Grade 10.  I was surprised when she called, will be meeting her and some other old DGS ppl on Saturday, whom I've lost contact for a long long time.  Kinda excited.

						   Hot Hot Hot! My office still doesn't have aircon! Hot Hot Hot!!!   Wing and I were so hot that we went to Lion Rock again for Tea from 5pm - 6 30pm.  We always have nice chat.  Will be attending her fellowship tomorrow if I can make it. I have loads of things to do tomorrow, like getting stuff from TST in the morning.  Busy Busy Busy.  But it's already 1 52am now... Aiya~  Tonight instead of going to the caregroup, I went to CSU 40th anniversary concert.  I went with Jimmy and Phoebe, Phoebe's sick today. Well, it's a pretty good concert.  Candice sang in the choir tonight.  So happy to be there! Sze Hon (Esmond, the guy who lost her sister several days ago) conducted most of the performance.  He performed well in the concert. Great! (Plz still pray for him, his family and friends) The concert ended at 11pm.  It's a long concert, everyone must be really tired.    At night, Jimmy and I walked Phoebe home cuz she's sick, then I had dinner with Jimmy at a restaurant near Phoebe's place.   The rain was pouring when I left the restaurant, was then forced to get an umbrella.  I still got soaked in the rain with the umbrella!! Ironically, there's not even a drop of rain in MOS (where I live), RIDICULOUS!!!!

						   Super Hot !!! Luckily, I stayed home at the hottest time of the day.  Well, lazy day! Didn't do much, just laid on my couch for the whole afternoon.    Went out for dinner with Billy at night.  Billy (I've known him since lower 6).  Haven't met him for around 3 years, if I remember correctly.  He hasn't changed much, got a little skinnier.  We went to this Vietnamese Restaurant called "Restaurant La Flamboyant" (Doesn't make much sense, isn't French or English at all).  Billy is now a wine specialist (and a great chef, who received training in Shanghai for his practicum last year), so I asked him questions on wine.  I asked him a lot of question on the wine "CARMEN" from Chille.  Apparently, I am not a great fan of any sort of liquor, so I was a total idiot in front of him.  hahaha! Well, we tried this white wine "Tamaya" 2002. It's pretty good, not too dry for me.  Tonite was some sorta farewell dinner for me.  We had a pretty good chat on relationships, we talked mostly about his gf.  She thought of joining our dinner, but couldn't make it in the end.  Sad~~~   Good that we still could have such a nice chat after all these years.  He's a funny friend of mine.

						   Returned to BU office, did some cleaning and packing.  Then went to Festival Walk for a haircut.  (a quick one)   Met Billy (wine-taster) at Mongkok.  Did  a lot of shopping, got new mouse and card reader etc.  Got a bottle of red wine for Family Dinner this week! Then went to TST for dinner at Peking Restaurant. Billy taught me how to cook easy Chinese food.  Good news:  Thank God! I have a place to stay in Athens for the days before school starts.  I'll be staying with Angelica (ex-roomate).  I actually have 3 days after my arrival to do a quick browsing around for an apartment.  I still don't know where to stay in NY.  God provides yeh? Please pray for me. But the good news is: Angelica may still be around for a bit after I reach Athens.  More, she's picking me up at the airport! I'm really excited to see her again.  Got a postcard from Jim! Thanks!

Still have 1 more task to go, hope it won't take too long.  Went jogging alone again this evening at 6pm.  Came back at 7 30pm.  Was a nice jog! Managed to jog longer than last time.  Will try to jog more often.   Please pray for my accomodation in OHIO. I still don't know where to stay.  Sob Sob*

						   Wow! A Day to Remember! I woke up earlier today cuz I wanted to get the pics developed, and wanted to be ON TIME to meet my bro and Shirley at Convention Centre.  Wow! What's the big event? HAhaha!! It was! At least to me!!!!! All my siblings went to ECC together today! Never happened before in my life!!!!! I'm still really excited about that!  After sermon, we went YUMCHA again at the hotel next to HKCC.  Then I picked up the pics, took a rest and went to TAI WAI for violin lesson.  Samuel said "Not bad! Pretty ok for a beginner!" Yea!!  I had dinner with Billy (wine-taster) tonight.  He carried this big bottle of Bailey's with him today.  hahaha! We then saw "SPIDERMAN 2" thought it's over!! It's not as good as I expected, a lil rushy towards the end.  Amazing! Met another DGS gal, Mendy Ma (if I remember her full name correctly) Didn't really chat much though.

						   Just finished a book by Joshua Harris "Boy Meets Girl" in the morning. Joshua's book is mainly about courtship/relationship, but it also encourages me to reflect upon my relationship with Christ. I was so deeply touched by a piece of writing he quoted from "When God Weeps" by Steven Estes and Joni Eareckson Tada, on salvation. Would like to share it with you, it's a long piece, but very meaningful indeed. My heart pounded hard and my eyes welled up while reading it:    The face that Moses had begged to see--was forbidden to see--was slapped bloody (Exodus 33:19-20). The thorns that God had sent to curse the earth's rebellion now twisted around his own brow...  "On your back with you!" ONe raises a mallet to sink in the spike. But the soldier's heart must continue pumping as he readies the prisoner's wrist. SOmeone must sustain the soldier's life minute by minute, for no man has this power on his own. Who supplies breath to his lungs? Who gives energy to his cells? Who holds his molecules together? Only by the Son do "all things hold together" (Colossians 1:17). The victim wills that the soldier live on--he grants the warriors continued existence. The man swings.  As the man swings, the SOn recalls how he and the Father first designed the medial nerve of the human forearm--the sensations it would be capable of. The design proves flawless--the nerves perform exquisiutely. "Up you go!" They lift the cross. God is on display in his underwear and can scarcely breathe.  But these pains are a mere warm-up to his other and growing dread. He begins to feel a foreign sensation. Somewhere during this day an unearthly foul odor began to waft, not around his nose, but his heart. He feels dirty. Human wickedness starts to crawl upon his spotless being--the living excrement from our souls. The apple of his Father's eye turns brown with rot. His Father! He must face his Father like this!  From heaven the Father rouses himself like a lion disturbed, shakes his mane, and roars against the shriveling remnant of a man hanging on a cross. Never has the Son seen the Father look at his son, never felt even the least of his hot breath. But the roar shakes the unseen world and darkens the visible sky. The Son does not recognize these eyes.  "Son of Man! Why have you behaved so? You have cheated, lusted, stolen, gossiped--murdered, envied, hated, lied. You have cursed, robbed, overspent, overeaten--fornicated, disobeyed, embezzled, and blasphemed. Oh, the duties you have shirked, the children you have abandoned! Who has ever so ignored the poor, so played the coward, so belittled my name? Have you ever held your razor tongue? What a self-righteous, pitiful drunk--you, who molest young boys, peddle killed drugs, travel in cliques, and mock your parents. Who gave you the boldness to rig elections, forment revolutions, torture animals, and worship demons? Does the list never end! Splitting families, raping virgins, acting smugly, playing the pimp--buying politicians, practicing exhortation, filming pornography, accepting bribes. You have burned down buildings, perfected terrorist tactics, founded flase religions, traded in slaves--relishing each morsel and braggin about it all. I hate, loathe these things in you! Disgust for everything about you consumes me! Can you not feel my wrath?"  Of course the Son is innocent. He is blamelessness itself. The Father knows this. But the divine pair have an agreement, and the unthinkable must now take place. Jesus will be treated as if personally responsible for every sin ever commited.  The Father watches as his heart's treasure, the mirror-image of himself, sinks drowning into raw, liquid sin. Jehovah's stored rage against humankind from every century explodes in a single direction.  "Father! Father! Why have you forsaken me?!"  But heaven stops its ears. The Son stares up at the One who cannot, who will not, reach down or reply.  The Trinity had planned it. The Son endured it. The Spirit enabled him. The Father rejected the Son whom he loved. Jesus, the God-man from Nazareth, perished. The Father accepted his sacrifice for sin and was satisfied. The Rescue was accomplished.      I don't know how you feel about this quote. May be your offenses do not appear on the list, name them yourself. I was deeply struck by this quote honestly. The Salvation was done for US!!! Joshua reminds us of John Stott's words "Before we can begin to see the cross as something done for us (leading us to faith and worship), we have to see it as something done BY us (leading us to repentance)... As we face the cross, then, we can say to ourselves both "I did it; my sins sent Him there," and "He did it; His love took Him there." Jesus was condemned for the sins in our past, present, future!! Once we accepted Christ as our Savior, God no longer looks at us as SINNERS; He doesn't see us as dirty/unworthy. He sees us as RIGHTEOUS as His Son.  "Come now, let us reason together," says the Lord. "Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red as crimson, they shall be like wool." (Isaiah 1:18)  "He does not treast us as our sins deserve or repay us according to our iniquities. For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his love for those who fear him; as far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us. (Psalm 103:10-12) (I love this very much!!!!)  "Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. (Romans 8:1)  We "nailed" Jesus on the Cross. If even such (WORST THING ANY HUMAN CAN DO) can be forgiven, then how can anything NOT BE FORGIVEN. Nothing can separate us from God's grace anymore. As long as we truly repent our sins, God's grace is sufficient for us. He's always waiting for us to return to His arms. We often say "We don't deserve this or that!" but God reminds us "It's not what you've done, it's what my Son has done for you."  I can't exactly describe my feelings to you. But I can tell you, my past keeps knocking from time to time, and sometimes I feel condemned/defeated by it.  All the time, I would feel so guilty that I locked myself up for several days; not willing to talk to anyone. But after reading this passage in the morning, I can say boldly "I am not ashamed anymore" cuz I've gained a clearer picture of salvation. God has forgiven me, and He sees me "as white as snow". NO! I may not be able to forget my past, but this makes me treasure God's grace even more.  Today's been a special day. I left MOS and went to Wing's fellowship. Met her little earlier so I shared with her some of my troubles. Well, I know exactly that I needed some advice from some elders in church. Sadly, I don't know how to get advice from my church, so I turned to Wing. And she brought me to this minister called "YIN LAN". She gave me a lot of help, and I was really encouraged by her words (in a 30 min chat). Funny! I'm reading this book called "Woman: God's Greatest Weapon", today's chapter was about "God's trusted people" which talks about all these really influential WOMEN in the bible; of course MARY is one of those characters. What a coincidence! At fellowship, the minister talked about the 4 Marys in the bible. Mary's song "My soul glorifies the Lord and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior" (Luke 1:46-47) (Chinese version is more touching) I think this is the sorta attitude that all of us (men/women) Christians must hold. We must place God at the highest at all times. When we meet up with situations/problems that are seemingly too big for us to handle, remember, our GOD is much BIGGER than the problem, He always has the power/wisdom to handle them for us.  Leave them all to God!  Praise the Lord!

						   So laid back at home. Been thinking too much...  Finally left home for a jog in the evening. Started at 6 15pm, jogged for half an hour, then took a long long walk home. It's a nice walk. I stopped by anything that attracted my attention: the skies, the "SHY" leaf (don't know the name for it)... Should have brought my camera with me, so I could take some pics. :P ugh~  I reached home at 8 30pm. Took a shower, then soaked my tiring feet into a bucket of warm (lemon-grass scented) water, then did a foot and leg massage for nearly an hour. So refreshing!  Love sweating! Feels good!  Had a nice chat with Heidy over MSN. We never wanna be "tied down" somehow. Ambitious girls, we are! Hope we can meet next week before I leave. Ugh~ I'm leaving really soon. What do I want to achieve?? UM.... A tough question, eh?

						   NO! We do not deserve anything!! (My thoughts) But He chose to send His Son to die for us on the cross.  What does that say? We're not measured by our love for Him, but He loves us first!   He cares ! Even the most trivial things in our lives! He cares! He shows His love by sending His only Son to die for us.  Let Him demonstrate His love, and reveal His plans IN HIS TIME.  "Be still before the Lord and wait patiently for him" (Psalm 37:7a)

						   I finally uploaded my new pics at 2 30 am this morning. I received a call from Yusuke at 1am, he called from Osaka. Guess he too was a little anxious about his examination.  I've been pretty anxious these days. Mostly for some "unknown" reasons. Guess one of the reasons is about accomodation in Athens, Ohio. I still haven't found a place to stay yet, and my NY trip. Also, my unfinished documents that are lying around my room/living room. Must begin working on them tomorrow. In fact, these things aren't troubling me too much. There's something else which is troubling me (guess it's too personal to share here) Suddenly I know I should submit myself and be obedient. But deep within me, I'm yearning "No! Please!" Most of the time, when you want to be IN CONTROL, probably you'll end up being OUT OF CONTROL. I guess I am experiencing this state now. My faith is too little.  Funny! All the time when I'm "out of control" I try to tidy my room/ throw things out. I managed to clean my desk nicely, and put away useless stuff in my drawers tonight. And played piano and violin this afternoon.  Please pray for me! I notice I'm getting weak in faith, and beginning to distant myself from Him again. May be cuz I've been locking myself up at home since yesterday. Need some fresh air tomorrow.

						   I'm soooo lazy today. Didn't do much. I watched TV, read the bible and a book, played an hour piano... and couldn't stop myself from stuffing myself with food. Guess feeling a little empty these two days. I have a lot to do, but don't wanna start yet... like finishing off those documents and my practising etc.  I tried to upload pics but there's something wrong with the Albumbuilder. I may need to use another pic provider. Don't know why I can't update the one that I'm using.  A lil frustrated today, need more patience. May be I've been thinking too much... needa relax a bit.

						   Woke up really early for piano lesson at 9am in Mei Foo. My mom may be learning piano from my teacher from next week. hahaha  I went to BU and cleared my stuff. Got a big load to carry home in the afternoon. Stayed with Wing for a while, reading the magazines in her room.  Don't know why, felt so hungry all day long. Filled my stomach with half a cake!!!!! :S Now feel extremely bad, won't eat cake for a while (SHORT! :P)  Reflecting my relationship with God day! I need more faith in Him! And a heart to seek for His will, not mine, all the time!  Tried to upload new pics to my website, but couldn't.  Need to find out the reason.  Guess I'll be staying home tomolo, and take a real good rest before working on Thurs!

						   Still feeling a lil uneasy today.  I went to church in the morning. Sang two really wonderful songs. I couldn't hold my tears when I read closely the lyrics of "When God Ran". I hope I can find the song somewhere on a CD. For the lyrics of this song, please check the end of this blog.  Ok. So I had lunch with JoLee and Irene after sermon. Then went to "New Chapter" bookstore again to get the book that I flipped through yesterday. The book is called "Women: God's secret weapon" by Ed Silvoso. It's a pretty nice book. Then I went to the mall near my home with my mom, did some shopping with her.  Bumped into Audrey Au (from grade school) at "New Chapter". Have been bumpin into quite a number of DGS ppl these weeks...  Pretty peaceful day.    Lyrics of the songs:    Almighty God, the Great I am, Immovable Rock, Omnipotent, Powerful, Awesome Lord. Vitorious Warrior, Commanding King of Kings Mighty Conuqueror And the only time, the only time I ever saw Him run.  Chrous: Is when He ran to me Took me in His arms, held my head to His chest Said "My son's come home again" Looked at my face, wiped the tears from my eyes With forgiveness in His Voice He said "Son, do you know I still love You" He caught me by surprise, Brought me to my knees, when God run.  The Day I left home, I knew I had broken His heart I wondered then if things could ever be the same Then one night, I remembered His love for me And down that dusty road, ahead I could see And the only time, the only time I ever saw Him run.    A really nice song. Can try this link to listen to it:  urlLink http://www.ebayer.4t.com/whengodran/    Here's another one:  All I once Held Dear (Knowing You) --Refer to Phillipians 3:1-11  All I once held dear, built my life upon, All this world reveres, and wars to own, All I once thought gain I have counted loss, Spent and worthless now, compared to this.  Chorus: Knowing You, Jesus, knowing You, There is no greater thing. You're my all, YOU're my rest, You're my joy, my righteousness, And I love you, Lord.  Now my heart's desire is to know You more, TO be found in YOu, and be known as YOurs, To possess by faith, what I oculd not earn, All surpassing gift of righteousness.  Oh, to know the power of Your risen life. And to know You in Your sufferings, To become life You, In Your death, my Lord, So, with You to live, and never die.

						   Had a wonderful day!  Saw Jimmy off at the airport. He's gonna spend 2 weeks in UK for the International Exchange Programme.  Please pray for his team, pray for their safety, and Jim's opportunity to share his experience in Christ with his teamates.    Spent time alone at Pacific Coffee (airport), stuffed myself up with a Lamington and Latte as usual. I have a really funny feeling tonite at the airport. Not that I would ever forget but surely recognised I have overcome the bitterness.  I am leaving very soon for Ohio.
