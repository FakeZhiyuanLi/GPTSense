         Well after much waiting... my repaired ipod should be arriving on Monday.  I got it for my birthday nearly a month ago and it came with a severely defective hard drive.     For those of you who are thinking of getting an ipod, I totally recommend it.  Just DO NOT buy direct from Apple.  If something happens to be messed up with it, your only alternative is to ship it back to apple and then they will take their sweet time on getting it back to you.  In my case they claim it took longer to get a replacement mailed back to be because it was a personalized ipod.  They said it would take 9 days longer (and this is after 2.5 weeks already) to get shipped to me because it needed to get re personalized.  Which frankly is a load of bull, since I received my first (broken) ipod in my hands, personalized and all, in exactly two business days.  In all fairness though, after a few weeks when my patience wore thin I complained to someone higher up and they "compensated" me with a complementary ipod accessory. So I should be getting a car charger too now.  So the moral of the story.  Buy and ipod.  Don't buy direct from Apple.  Unless you enjoy self inflicted pain.

      For some reason the Mail-to-Blogger feature seems very unreliable.  I have tried many test posts and in every case I get a Delivery delay message from the mailer daemon.  Only once did the post ever go through, and even then it took 4 hours to get posted... and it was from another account.  Its really frustrating.  Grrr....

       urlLink Scamming the Scammer   Every now and then you hear tales of people being screwed over by scammers on the internet.  Whether it be via email, or buying a product which never gets delivered.... or in our case selling a product on ebay and not getting paid.  Well this is the story of how the scammer got scammed.  Its a bit of a long read, but it turns into a pretty good story.  Some loser in England tried to con a guy into selling his Powerbook through a fake escrow service.  Jeff (the good guy in this story) caught on to the scam early on in the game and decided to turn the tables on the scammer.  It interesting to see how this all snowballed into an international affair with full blown "remote agents" ;-) in England taking photos and spying on Mr. Scammer.   Every step of the scam was documented...  Its worth checking out.  Wish I had the guts to do what this guy did...

      It seems that Gmail now allows users to import a list of their contacts from their existing address books.  For universal compatibility Gmail asks for your addresses in a CSV file (Comma separated Values).  Most major address books, like Outlook, Outlook Express, or Palm Desktop can save your contacts to a CSV file.  The feature may still be a bit buggy however.

       urlLink Pop Goes the Gmail. SMTP/POP server for Gmail!   Here is a small app that lets you access your Gmail account via POP3.  Basically it lets you access gmail through a mail application, such as Outlook Express or Eudora, like you would any other email account. It has been a much requested feature, and Google has assured us that at some point it will offer some method (not necessarily POP3) to download your email from Gmail.  I personally find Gmail's user interface to be one of its strongest features.  No POP for me!

Oh yeah, Scott's personal email address is scottrichter422@yahoo.com  New to the world of blogging, I am still figuring out the appropriate net etiquette (netiquette?) for linking to other peoples blogs or files.

      For those of you lucky enough to get your hands on a Gmail account while its in beta, here is a handy little program you might find useful.  Its called Gtray and it is a tiny app than runs in your system tray, notifying you of any new messages in your inbox.  It is not officially made by Google, but its a good temporary solution until they make something similar of their own.  here's a screen shot:    In the future it would be cool if Google provided a small application that would do all of the above and also make Gmail your default mail application within Windows.

      I have been meaning to start one of these for quite some time now and never seemed to get around to it.  After months of cyber-dust collecting on this page it seems that the best way to begin is to just put pen to paper, or umm... in this case fingers to keys.  With respect to the direction this blog will take over time....well I am just going to let it evolve on its own and see where it ends up.  I suppose it is starting out as a personal blog and might change along the way.  If you somehow find your way here, please leave a comment mentioning how.... I'd be curious to know how you happened to stumble upon my corner of the net..... and will glad you give you directions to somewhere far more interesting.

        In fact, not only would you not be at this site, you would not be at any site.  Tim Berners-Lee, is the person who invented the World Wide Web.  The entire concept of http and html... was this guy.  The World Wide Web is the most widely known and used part of the Internet (with the exception of email I suppose).  The Internet has been around since the 1960 in one form or another, but it was crude and not readily accessible to the public.  It was the WWW that made the Internet what it is today.  Most people don't even differentiate between the two.  What impresses me the most about him is his modesty.  He is clear to point out that although many of the core concepts were of his design, the WWW would not be what it is without the help of thousands of others.  It also would not be here had he tried to privatize his ideas.  He made them free and public.  He didn't try to make a quick buck, which is what we are used to seeing today.     The Internet is becoming more and more ingrained in our everyday lives.  From businesses, to stocks, to communication, to entertainment, to simple personal blogs like my own.  Its crazy to think how one mans simple ideas can literally move the world.

       urlLink    (Click for full size)  A few days ago I reported that Gmail now allowed users to import contacts by uploading a CSV file. Then to my surprise when people asked where I found this feature... it disappeared!  Of course seeing as I was the only one who claimed to see it, it left my sanity questioned (well... questioned further..)  But I am not Nuts!!... and now I have proof!  The screen capture above was taken while I was working on a Solaris ( Unix ) machine on campus.  I was also using Netscape as my browser.  When I logged into gmail there I had the option to upload contacts, but when I logged into Gmail simultaneously on a Windows XP machine I saw the old contacts page with no import options.  Strange huh?  Not sure why, but this is more concrete evidence that the feature is in the works.  For the record though I have not tried to import any contacts yet.

        Its official, Firefox 0.9 is out.  For those of you who don't know about this web browser I highly recommend you look into it.  I was hesitant at first since Internet Explorer did everything I needed it to do as a browser.  But that's just because I did not know about what I was missing out on.  Once you use Firefox, IE just seems lacking.    Some of the great features Firefox has to offer are tabbed browsing, a very extensive plugin (or as they call them extensions) architecture, the ability to block ANY item from loading (great for blocking ads), and for some reason I swear my pages load up faster in Firefox too.

           Perhaps its because I am easily amused, but when I saw this think I thought it was pretty cool.  Its called the Aquada and its an amphibious sports car, meaning that it can drive on roads or water.  Amphibious cars have been around for some time now, the 1960's I think, but they usually had sub-par performance in comparison to standard cars on the road or normal boats on the water.  They were also not much to look at.  The Aquada can go about 100 mph on land and about 40 mph on water, which is not too shabby.  It also looks alright.  I could see James Bond in one of these.  That might explain why it was designed in England.  It could be a handy vehicle for people who's daily commute involves taking a ferry.  Richard Branson, Virgin's thrill seeking chairman, recently drove across the English Channel in one of these.

      Looks like Yahoo has decided to fight back and has started to block third party programs like Trillian from connecting to its Yahoo Messenger.  For those of you that don't know, Trillian is a program which lets you connect to all four major IM networks from one program.  If you are like me and know people who use either MSN, ICQ, AIM and Yahoo.... it can be a pretty useful since I don't need to have four separate programs running.  The only real problem with Trillian is that it lags behind the official IM clients in terms of features.  There is nothing you can do about it really, since the official clients have to introduce a new feature before Trillian gets a chance to play catch up and update its software.    For me though, updates between versions of Trillian are so few and far apart that I can't justify every paying for it again.  Its updated once a year, with the occasional patch every now and then for when they get blocked (like right now by Yahoo).  Also pretty much everyone I know has migrated to MSN messenger now... so I don't really need it now either.

       urlLink    It seems that if you are a Mac user and use Camino 0.7 as your browser you too can import contacts in gmail.  Why have us windows users been left out of the loop?  I know not.  Probably to test the feature with a smaller group first.  If you have been able to import contacts on some other OS or using a certain browser, then please leave a comment.

        BMW is the first car to offer the ability to integrate your iPod into your car stereo.  It's nothing real fancy, actually, but it does what it's supposed to.  After you plug your iPod into the connector in the car, the radio detects your iPod as a CD Changer and treats it as so.  You can create five playlists, which the radio considers "CD's" and then using the stereo control buttons on the steering wheel of your car you can switch between different playlists and tracks.    As usual Apple has a funky ad out for the occasion.  urlLink iPod BMW Ad

        I just saw Spider-Man 2 today!  It was a midnight screening (I know.. it's a bit geeky... but there is a little geek in all of us... or in my case locked in a cage only to be let out on special occasions).  Seeing as the geek has clearly escaped, I will continue post haste and get to locking it up again.  To start off, I enjoyed it...The movie was pretty good in my opinion.  Ebert and Roper said it was the best superhero movie of all time, and I won't go that far, but it was a worthy sequel.  I would say as good as the first, which is something few sequels can boast.  Needless to say it will be a block buster.  While I don't consider what follows to be spoilers since they seem pretty obvious to me, you can feel free to stop reading now.   | | | | V A great deal of the movie focuses on Peter Parker who is torn between what he wants, Mary Jane, and what he feels he needs to do, be Spider-Man.  That whole "With great power, comes great responsibility" speech by his Uncle Ben comes into play of course and Peter has to make a choice again.  Its this internal struggle within him that affects him in more ways than one.  The only problem I had with that was it took up too much of the movie... More than it needed.  After a while you forgot that Spider-Man was fighting Doc Oc and not just his inner demons.  But when all that is taken care of the movie picks up a bit.  Since it was an action movie the fight scenes were great!  Really well done I thought, especially Doc's tentacles.  There were a few moments when you could tell that Spidey and Doc Oc were CG...  but I can give them a break there.    Ok now this is the closest thing in here to a spoiler, (not really though) .... there was one part in particular that dealt with Spider-Man's secret identity that I thought was pretty cool.  The secret identity of a Super Hero is always an important part of who he is and with that being said there was just one part of the movie where you ask yourself... did that really happen??  :-)  There were also a few cameos by some characters in the first movie that gave the sequel a nice touch.  The ending was not bad either...just a little covered in cheese!! The last scene with Mary Jane was a little too overly Hollywood for my tastes. But then the last scene with Harry was much better and darker. It reminded me of the ending of X-Men 2, which left you with a good idea of what to expect for the next one... and makes you eager to see it too!!!  This sequel came out only two years after the first, so perhaps we can expect to see the third in 2006.  I have heard that everyone is signed on for the third already which is good news... should be one to look forward too.

                  Seeing as the Internet grows more and more multicultural everyday I figured It might be handy to have access to this site in several different languages.  Well, actually, no I did not... I just thought it would be a neat toy for my site.  At the bottom of the right hand section of this page you have the option to translate this page into a variety of different languages at the click of a button.  Give it a try.  For what it's worth I've recently noticed quite a few hits to this site from many different countries, so this might not be such a bad idea.  If you actually found this feature useful, leave a comment and maybe where you're from.

      Finally some genius has figured out a way to make Gmail your default mail client.  What that means is that when you click a mailto: link in a webpage or anywhere, a compose window will automatically open up with the email address inside, instead of opening up outlook express (or whatever other email client you use).  Its called  urlLink G-Mailto .  I am currently using it and have noticed no problems with it so far.  It installs in two seconds and then asks you which browser you want to use for gmail.  Hooray for us Firefox users.  To test it out I have clicked a few email links on web pages and instantly a new browser window opens up at the compose page.  The email address and even (if the mailto link included this part) the subject line is filled out.  Works like a charm  They guy who figured it out downloaded the 256 KB Gmail JavaScript code and parsed through it all.  He has a whole bunch of useful URL commands you can use to interface with gmail directly from the address bar of your browser.  Its pretty cool.  I recommend checking it out.

      Guess what I saw online?  The pilot episode of Joey.  Yup that's right... NBC's Friends spin-off starring Joey Tribiani... Some how a DVD screener of the episode made it on to the net.  In this day and age I guess I shouldn't be surprised.  Spin-off's rarely do well and this one was no exception.  Unfortunately (or fortunately depending on your point of view) I don't see this show pulling a Frasier in the near future.  If anyone at NBC is happens to stumble upon my site, don't worry I did not pass the file along to anybody or even keep the episode, I did everyone a favor and deleted it from my drive.  There is enough crap on the net as it is.

      A few posts ago I mentioned how I finally received my repaired iPod.  It took a while, but it is oh so sweet.  Like many people though, one of the main places I like to listen to my tunes is in my car.  BMW and Apple have a solution for you, as I  urlLink mentioned earlier , but what about those of us without a BMW.  This solution might not be as fully integrated, but all modesty aside it is pretty slick.  (Click any image for a larger view)  urlLink     urlLink   urlLink     The picture above is of my iPod docked in my 2002 Mazda Protege. In total these are the things visible above: 1. The iPod (well duh..) 2. The  urlLink Belkin Auto Kit for iPod w/ Dock Connector  3. The  urlLink iTrip  (not necessary if you have an Aux line in for your vehicle) 4. The  urlLink iSkin eVo  case (not necessary, but it is shown above) 5. The  urlLink Arkon CM625 Universal PDA 15" Flexible Gooseneck Mount    urlLink     urlLink    To begin with the Arkon gooseneck mount was VERY easy to install.  It connects directly to the mounting bolt of the passenger side seat. All you have to do is loosen the bolt a bit and slide the bottom mounting bracket in.  Make sure you then re-tighten the bolt so the mount and more importantly the passenger seat is secure.   urlLink    The part of the mount which actually grips the iPod is adjustable in almost every way.  The bottom and sides which grip the iPod are made of a very soft foam so you know your iPod is safe.  You squeeze the sides of the mount together to clasp the iPod in its place.  There is a small release button on the side to loosen the grip of the mount when you want to remove the iPod.  I should also point out for those of you that are not comfortable playing around with the insides of your car Arkon provides MANY different ways of mounting PDA sized devices in your car.  Some of these other products do not require you to tinker with any bolts or what not.  urlLink Check them out .   urlLink    The Belkin power adapter is one of the best accessories I have seen for the iPod.  It plugs into the cigarette lighter of your car and connects to the bottom of your iPod via the Dock connector.  Not only that, but it provides a line out jack as well, so that you do not need to get your audio input from the top of the iPod.  One simple connector to the bottom of the iPod delivers both power and sound.  However in my case I could not make use of the line out, since I do not have a line in for the radio of my car.   urlLink    Instead I use the iTrip, which is the white cylinder looking thing on the top of the iPod.  It's a tiny powerful FM transmitter which is designed specifically for the iPod.  I won't go into exactly how it works here, but all you need to do is tune it to an empty FM station in your area and it will broadcast music on it.  The cool thing about it is that it requires no external power source.  It gets its power from the iPod itself.  This will make the iPod battery run out faster, but since we are getting power from the car adapter this is not an issue.  Some have complained that the sound quality is sub par.  I for one have had NO problems with it. I think it sounds great.  That being said it sounds as good as any other FM station on the radio.  FM can sound good, but it is not CD quality.  Ideally its best if you can find some way to directly connect the iPod to your car radio using a wire.  If you can, then as mentioned above, the Belkin power adapter will help you two fold.  It should be noted that this idea was not entirely mine. I was looking for a way to mount my iPod in my car and I found someone else online who did it as well.  I already had the Belkin adapter and iTrip, but it was  urlLink this site  that led me to the Arkon mount.   If you have any questions, please feel free to email me or leave a comment.  I'd be glad to give you a hand.

        Happy Canada Day for any readers on the better side of the North American Continent... (well the world really... but no need to brag)  I celebrated the weekend by hurling down the Ottawa River in a rubber dingy.  For those of you who have never been whitewater rafting I highly recommend it.  Its like going on a roller-coaster, but without any of the safeties on.  There were moments as I approached the crest of a wave when I asked myself what the hell I was doing.  Although no one fell off of our raft and it never got flipped, others were not so lucky.  There were a few crews who got completely tossed out of their rafts and into the water, or for what seemed for the moment, the swirly vortex of doom.   In the end: Farhad 1...  Mother Nature 0.  (after typing this post Farhad drowned in his bathtub.... stupid Karmic Retribution)

      Well its 8:43 pm and I am still in my lab.... sigh.. Nothing too fun to write about in this post... it's more just for the sake of posting something.  I have been coding in VHDL for a for hours now with little progress and well I need something to take my mind off of this thing I call a thesis... yay.... The problem right now is that it takes so long to compile my code every time I make a change... which is every few minutes.  On another note I took a few minutes to walk around the new Integrated Learning Centre on campus... and all I can say is Wow!  Its so nice I can't believe that there are actually going to be students who will be taking classes there... Seriously... I will post some pictures of it a little later.

         At first I was a bit confused as to what exactly these Google Group things were.  They sort of resemble an online forum, but also are closely tied in with email.  I frequent a few forums on the net so I am used to concept of group posting....but what is special about Google Groups.  It took me a while to figure it out, but essentially Google Groups is a place where you can create a custom mailing list.  Not an ordinary one though... an interactive list.  Each group has an unique email address and website.  If you want to post to the group you can just send an email to that address.  Alternatively you could go to the website and post directly there.  At that point anyone who is subscribed to the group will receive your post via email.  So any email to that one Google Groups email address automatically sends itself to everyone on the list.  A recipe for SPAM you say... I thought so too.  Luckily that's not the case though.  The only way to get onto a group is if you subscribe to one.  The cool thing about this setup is that its not one way communication.  You can REPLY to an message you receive from the group.  It can be a handy way for big groups to communicate without having to type in 10 different email addresses.  All messages send back and forth via email are also visible on the group website and threaded in a similar manner as Gmail.  Pretty clever if you ask me.  This would have been real useful back when I had large group projects and lots of our coordination was done by email.  The project members need only one email address to contact everyone and there is a website which keeps track of all emails sent and received to that address so that it's easy to reference a conversation.  What will they think of next?

        One of the students in my lab showed this to me and I was really impressed.  Its probably one of the best optical illusions I have seen in a while.  What is the illusion you ask.  You see the squares marked A and B?  Well they are supposed to be the same colour..... and they are.  A trick I found to help see past the illusion is to stare at square B and use your peripheral vision to see A.  It helps keep  your brain from fooling you.  neat.

      Before I begin let me just say that when this band first came out I thought they were pretty good.  What's not to like?  But after a while I started to notice something... at first I thought it was just me, but others noticed it too.  All of their songs sound exactly the same!!! Can you guess the band?  Give up?    It's Nickelback.  I found this site which accurately sums up what I am getting at.  Watch and feel used.  urlLink http://www.thewebshite.co.uk/nickelback.htm   To summarize.  Nickelback, you suck.

        Man does it look sweet.  And of course this now means that my model... the one I have had for about a month... has now been discontinued. blah...  These new models are also 100 dollars cheaper than their respective counter parts!!  Which is pretty unheard of in the computer industry.  It goes to show you how well sales are going for Apple.  Supposedly they TRIPLED their annual profits this year solely due to the iPod.  The last music carrying device to have such swooping effect was the Walkman released by Sony 25 years ago.    The new model features Apple's "Click Wheel".  It combines the Play/Pause and Menu buttons, and the touch scroll wheel into one convenient unit.  It was introduced with the iPod mini and was so well taken to that they decided to port it over to the regular iPod.  It also features an upgraded OS which has the usual tweaks here and there.  Hopefully Apple will release an update for my (3G model) iPod sometime in the future.  Sigh.. my iPod may no longer be the latest and the greatest, but its still pretty cool.  :-)

       urlLink    The image above was taken from www.floridatoday.com.  Click the picture to read more in depth on the subject.   It seems that the  urlLink Ansari X Prize  may not be spoken for just yet.  SpaceShipOne has some competition... from Canada!  The name of the Canadian Team is called the da Vinci Project and their ship is the Wild Fire.  This heats up the race for the $10 million dollar prize for the first private group to launch into space and then repeat the task  within two weeks.

       urlLink     I did a little digging and found someone who has posted pictures of a 3G iPod and the new 4G iPod side by side.  For the most part they are not so different in terms of size.  Also some people are complaining that they are not as fond of this new "Click Wheel" as they are with the 3G touch sensitive buttons.  Perhaps I got lucky after all.

      Finally, catching up to the competition.. as usual, Microsoft has released a web based version of their popular MSN Messenger.  What this means is you can now log into MSN from ANY computer in the world, even if they don't the actual MSN messenger client installed on that machine.  All you need is a relatively recent web browser and you can be chatting in no time!  Even at work where you may not have MSN installed.  ;-)  There is a neat little globe icon next to your name when you use it too.    (you can't see the globe.. other people on your msn list will see the globe, so they know you are using the web version)  The thing which shocked me the most was that it did not require me to be using Internet Explorer to access the Web Messenger (as the call it).  I could use it just fine from Firefox.  Usually Microsoft web products rely on ActiveX to work, which only run in IE.  This of course is a pain since to basically means the only way you can use their product is if you "choose" to use Internet Explorer.  ActiveX is also partly to blame for all the recent security issues with Windows.  While its not an entirely bad idea, it just has too many holes at the moment.  Its refreshing to see Microsoft give us a choice again.  I commend them on that.  Check the  urlLink MSN Web Messenger  out.

         See if you bitch...and bitch... results can happen.  Of course it took two years, but hey it happened.   urlLink Cerulean Studios , the company that makes Trillian, now has a blog to keep us more updated of their progress.  Trillian is an IM client that lets you connect to all the major IM clients such as MSN, ICQ, AIM, and Yahoo.  It can be a real help if you have friends who use different IM mediums and you don't want to install 4 different programs to chat with them.  Well now you only need 1.  I invite you to check them out.

      Wireless baby!  As I type this post I am sitting in the brand new Integrated Learning Centre on campus from my laptop which is wirelessly connected to the Internet.  I know that this is slowly becoming common place nowadays, but its still a new experience for me.  All the main Computer and Electrical Engineering buildings have WiFi access now so I decided to get a wireless adapter for my laptop. Honestly that was really just an excuse since I have wanted one for a while now, but never had a place to use one!  I got one of those fancier 802.11g or 54g cards since it lets me connect to Internet access points (which support the 802.11g standard) at 54 mbps.  Which is pretty fast considering most high speed Internet access you might have at home is only between 1 - 3 mbps.  Of course even if you connect at 54 mbps it does not mean that you will actually transfer data at that rate.  The farther you get from the wireless access point broadcasting the signal the slower your connection gets due to the weaker signal strength and resulting increase in possible errors.  But even then its fast!!  Most of the campus uses the 802.11b standard which only goes up to 11 mbps, but the good thing is all 802.11g products are backwards compatible with those networks as well.  Good bye wireless... hello radio waves saturating my every pore.  I am sure its safe.... right? (if not then good by future children as well...)
