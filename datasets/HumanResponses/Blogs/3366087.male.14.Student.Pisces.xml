						   they say the hardest part of your life is adolescence.i find it quite true.in this period,you start developin both mentally and physically.however,these developments are far from any other that you will ever encounter.physical development is pointless in a philosophical discussion.however,mental development is a very important in everyone's life.many thoughts are suddenly introduced.the most common ones are love,vice and sex,sex being the most prominent.also,it is in this period that we start developing ideas of our own.we start to disagree with teacher,parents,basically our elders,who mostly think they are always right,causing you to get rebuked for thinking otherwise. then we end up getting pissed about it.and start rebelling.indeed,rebellion is one of the main things that will happen during adolescence.however,the most important development during adolescence is a change of mindset.from young,we have been taught to be better than others,to stand out.however,the mindset of a common adolescent person would not be to stand out,but to fit in with the crowd.most adolescent people do have a desire to be unique,or to be better in any way.their first thought is to not appear unusual.as a result,most of them prefer following the latest fashion,as they know a lot of people would,to satisfy their need to be 'normal'.as a result of all these problems, adolescence is indeed a very tough time for us all.

      Life is boring   June holidays is HELLISH BORIIIIING....   Very intersting thing happened 2day. I wuz playin gunbound with a fren when we suddenly talked about despos. (thats me, supposedly) Then we went on 2 tok about raja kamarul (one of the lousy fags from 2I) and his goddamned flirting. then we went on 2 tok about his partners so far. next came the climax...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  We suspected that kamarul might have had SEX b4 with his current partner. Vry nice. Being the ultra jealous guy i wuz, (im supposed 2 b despo, c?) i suggested looking into the matter.   y?   So i could use the law 2 get my own back on kamarul (remember, he is a goddamn flirt while i havent got a girlfriend) by charging him with statatory rape (dunno if spelling is correct.   In the end, i decided that protecting his current partner, si hui's fren, wuz more important. hence, i decided. i would rather hack kamarul by myself when skool reopens.  smart idea rite   i m such a despo.   Quote of the day:  Virginity is not dignity, it's just lack of opportunity.   quite true rite
