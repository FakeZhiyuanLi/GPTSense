      hey! today was the freakiest day ever this year!! guess what? as usual, i went to school. i was kinda early today (bout 7.10 am, i reached school). so, as i was walking up to class, i heard a woman's voice calling my name. well, she is my bm teacher, PSN. well, she told me to help her with sumthing and i tot it would be like, carrying her bags or sumthing, but no. i was wrong. she asked me and L (my fren) to do public speaking. i was like saying "SHIIIIIT!" inside. she said to use the text i used for my lisan. well, that text for lisan was like SO last month! i could hardly remember the title. thank god, she kept our text and she told us to prepare ourselves and blah blah blah. L and i  felt so screwed! however, we got it through and i asked my frens how i did..well they just said sumthing like...it was pretty obvious that I was nervous and everything. Well, heck it. its over neways...  really worried bout the installation for the interact club...well, its postponed, letters have not been sent, programme book not finished, souveniers not done, performances not ready, its pretty screwed up actually. i really hope it turns up well...or THE will just look down upon interactors...(thats his job neways...) oooh...and i heard the vice pres will be from form 3...i wonder who...A? CS? or D? well...i aint got any ideas...  tomorrow's my interview for the central committee post for library board. i really dunno if i can make it for the position...really hope i do! well..i guess all i can do now is just pray and let God decide for me. but hey, i have a tough competition. KK, K, H, D, S, P, A, and a whole lot more...  oooh! ah sa has this new movie up...named "chasing august 15" (its a temp. name though)...its bout there will be 2 ah sa's...one of them is a human while the other is a robot...the human form ah sa falls in love with ronald cheng (main actor) while the robot form ah sa was sent to KILL him...well...i kinda like the plot..i bet its gonna be funny..and not to mention..lame since ronald cheng is the main actor...he is a good comedian :D  one more thing! im so into the song "i miss u" by blink 182...yea..i know its kinda old already but its like stuck in my head...luv it so much!!!  thats all for now...bye! l8r...

(i mean, its not like seb cares bout being the responsibilities or not..she just wants the title).    i havent buy twins latest cd "girl power" yet...im kinda broke this month...spent too much on cell phone and...i cant even remember how i spent my money but....i so want that cd!! the imported one! im so gonna buy it!!   i know this song is kinda old, (im sorry for not being updated with the latest thing in music industry) but i really really love the song "the reason is u" by hoobastank! its so so SO meaningful! besides that, another song which is stuck in my head is an oldies which is "reunited" by Peaches and herbs. i really love that song...its awesome.    i havent been to the cinemas lately...i wanna watch "three of a kind" by miriam and sean. i also wanna watch "kill bill vol. 2". i love the first volume and im sure the second will be as good...or maybe better..although oo-renshi is dead.  hmm..thats all i guess. love u ppl! and nitey..

      hey ppl guess wut? this week, i'll have 5 test which are : bio, chem, physics, moral and history. i SO LOVE HISTORY! (cud u sense the sarcasm?) i just dun understand a single bloody thing bout Islam. and hell, there are 5 chapters on it. omg...wtv man  as for bio, the Mr i-am-too-good-to-be-true, said that "we'll see who will have the last laugh since u guys were not paying attention to the presentation" haha. im laughing now. haha. just did it again. and for all u know, even if i did it badly (choi!) i will still laugh. haha.   i have enuff of physics. although miss sumi is really good at teaching...its just me who is really bad at learning. enuff of all the stupid archimedes' principle, bernoulli's principle and all those sh!t. its just so difficult to understand. so wut if f=kx ? i just dislike the subject...  chem...i guess its really interesting. just that u have to memorize a lot of stuff. like this + oxygen u get this. and then u have to balance the equation. however, i kinda like the subject...(though the teacher is a little boring..)  ooh, twins new movie, The Twins Effect 2 starring twins (duh), jaycee (jackie chan's son-really looks like his father and is rumoured with gillian chung [eww!]), jackie chan, donnie yen (i think this is how u spell his name), daniel wu (the baddy in the movie), and guest starring edison chen (haha! he isnt the main character this time! though i prefer him more than jaycee) will be showing in august. i cant wait for it! and rumours have it that they might be promoting the movie in singapore...so hehe..i can ask my sis to go and maybe get their signature and poster! :D  alrite ppl..i'll stop here...ciaoz and wish me luck in the test...

      hey ppl... guess wut? sis is in singapore now..to be exact, NUS. she is doing engineering...then later..she might get into bio-engineering. like wut she said, she never thought bout doing engineering. until, she was given a chance and i guess she is trying it out (DOH).&nbsp;i guess this is life. u will never know wut He has planned for u. and this makes life interesting. although sumtimes its hard but, wtv.  ooh! today i started the script already! for those who doesnt know wut the hell im talking bout...actually..only my sis knows bout this...ok, here it is. (takes a deep breathe) im gonna try to write a movie script! but its gonna be in chinese...though i dunno how to write chinese..i'll be writing it in pinyin. reason why i am writing in chinese? cos it suits the theme and title more. the title of my "movie" is "soup". there will be 3 stories in it. but of cos...im not gonna write it here...just wait for the movie, k? :D  today, we did the bio presentation..and obviously, en shamsul didnt like it. reason : our group laughed too much.&nbsp;while doing the presentation...we just laughed and laughed...but hey, we still did it nicely...just wanna warm up the atmosphere a bit...and u know wut he said? he said we bestarians do not know when to behave, when to clap, when to laugh. and he said that only "orang gila yang tidak tahu control feelings mereka". wtv man.  ooh..its getting late. gotta sleep now...nitey!

      hey today was hari anugerah... the prize giving day. one funny thing, i woke up late today! and hell, i was rushing here and there...and if it werent for lynda's phone call...i would still be snoring away...then i rushed to the toilet, brushed my teeth, went down and took my breakfast (hehe...still had the time to do so...i believe breakfast is important and i will never never skip it...). then i quickly went up and took a shower...and wore my clothes...(a grey t-shirt with black tie and black slacks..) then gelled my hair and tada! i glanced at the clock and it showed 10.00 am! shit! im supposed to be there by 10.15...and the place (holiday villa hotel) is like...40 minutes away from my hse! so mom and i rushed to the place and luckily...we were there just in time...the VIPs came late so, i wasnt exactly "late". so, i was sitting with the 3 hippos namely kim, lyn and seb, mizzy, alicia, hannah, karen, shashi and adeline. we later had to bear 40 minutes of long boring speeches by pengetua (eww!) and the guest of honour...(cant remember his name...) and hell, his speech was damn boring...its not like its funny or anything...and he tried to cracked some jokes but there were just lame. then, it was the prize giving ceremony itself. i waited kinda long as we were the pmr award winners so, its kinda like the last few items. so, we clapped, clapped, clapped and clapped for the rest and until the prize winners for form 2, i gave up clapping. i then only clapped for my friends...and those WORTH clapping for...eg: victoria voon cos' she won like...8 awards? :O &nbsp; then came the concert, the first item, silat was ok..until they (as in the PA crew) screwed up the music and they (as in silat performers) were like posing and they didnt know what to do. so, puan rosnah covered up everything and then the music came and then the silat performers left the stage (i supposed, feeling red and embarrassed). then came the so called "choir". well, they practically shouted. maybe choir members HAVE to "sing" that way..im not sure [cos' i was never a choir member :( ] then it was the "oh, fatimah!" dance...all i could say is "...." then i cant remember the order but later on, they had the band (well...it wasnt that bad..), the "sway" dance (i love that song!!) and then the play "macbeth". From my observation, no one was watching it. then it was the "harmoni" dance...the indian dance was ok..chinese was ok too&nbsp;but the malay dance is funny! (maybe&nbsp;becos' kevin and aaron were dancing..) &nbsp;then the finale and all...they "sang" gemilang, and then it ended with the national anthem.  &nbsp; well, the hari anugerah (2004) was ok...at least the food was ok. but i think the waiters and waiteresses were kinda pissed with our table...cos we kept asking for sumthing...first we asked for coffee...then he came with the coffee ONLY...then karen asked for tea, he came with tea only, then kim and lyn asked for coffee again. then later on, we had no more milk, so one waiteress passed by and we asked her for milk (dun think dirty, k?)and when she left, we realised we&nbsp;do not have any sugar left too. then she came with the milk and then we asked her for sugar. she then walked away and came back with the sugar. i could sense the "tidak puas hati" feeling when i drank the coffee... &nbsp; so, after hari anugerah, i rushed home and changed my clothes (in less than 5 minutes) and left cos we had to go to my grandma's hse...my aunt from england is back. then i came back bout...5 sumthing and then i came online and wrote this. later, i will have to do my PEKA physics, and also my add maths homework...(still havent finished it..its damn hard...) so, wish me luck and ciaoz! &nbsp; (._.)v peace!!

      right, this is how bad im feeling now. 4 PEKAs and 3 are due tomorrow! shit! and i havent started a thing! it all started because the pentafsir kawasan will be coming on wednesday, all the science teachers have somehow got into a trance and gave us experiments. one after another. and another. and another. and thats why im stuck with 4 PEKAs. after completing the bio assignment, the stupid website is finally up but it is somehow stupidly done. well, the layout is boring, the text are weird...basically, i think it is pretty screwed up.   well, enough of all the negative thoughts. lets change the topic...hmm...ooh! i watched mean girls already and it is a COOL show! seriously, it rocks! lindsay lohan was so COOL! i so like the movie...im gonna buy the dvd soon...hehe  btw, hari anugerah is this sunday. however, things arent really ready yet, especially the so called concert. the dances are kinda lame, and despite all the hardwork and effort they put in, something is missing...and the band consist of kev, aaron, daryl, brian and ian is ok...just that, *cough* nevermind..im getting an award this year! and thats PMR award! yea!! im like so excited!!  ooh..one more thing! sis rented this tvb drama bout psychology and it is one cool drama! im always into these mysterious stuff and hell, the drama is all bout it! and for those who thinks that watching chinese dramas are lame, well...u are so wrong. this drama is so educational. say, being a kleptomaniac is actually a sickness that even the person who does it doesnt know s/he is doing it or maybe s/he is doing it because s/he is stressed or facing some problems. and a lot more...  well..dats all i gotta say this time...later  (._.)v peace!!

      hey ppl before i start my blog...just let me scream. AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!  im feeling really bad. i just cant do this. no. its just too difficult for me to breathe. i cant breathe! i have so many stupid things happening that i cant control any.  firstly, stupid song for stupid academis week on monday. they (certain ppl in the choir) just cant stop being so playful and fcuking childish for once. especially jeremy. he just loves to make some stupid fcuking lame actions that can just piss the fcuking shit out of me. imagien this. u are standing in front of the stupid choir, trying to get them to listen to you. and there, the 3 fcuking hippos will be talking away. jeremy will be doing some actions and get the whole lame group laughing and then thebban and shashi and amir will be there following jeremy. its really hard to control them. they wouldnt listen. and i dunno what jeremy is thinking but i think he thinks he is trying to be funny. well, me kicking his a$$ would be funny.  science and maths quiz. hannah and i will be the emcees...well. i aint got complain for that cos not much work is neede there. i just need to be there and read the questions.  interact choir. i also have no complain for that as this is the first performance we were told to prepare for. so, i guess there is nothing really.  librarians' nite is another problem. firstly, invitations not sent out. ppl havent pay for the dinner. performances not up. even the guest arent even told about this. and guess wut? the nite is next friday. wow! i have so much time!  then comes sejarah sketch. i wrote the freaking script and then the 3 hippos just can be satisfied. i mean, they will NEVER be satisfied...not until we follow their stupid fcuking ideas. well, if you were to say "no, ur idea sucks" or sumthing, they would be cursing behind you and they wouldnt commit themselves into the sketch. fcuk them.  you know whats the worst thing bout being the head of a performance? its that, when you are too nice ie listen to everyone's idea, you will never get them satisfied. cos each of them will wanna do it their way. and so, solution is, say it this way, "Everyone listen, XX has an idea" or "According to XX, we shud...." like this. In this way, u will be avoided from being called lame and everything when someone disagrees with the idea.  another thing which sucks when u are the leader is that when u try to get them listen to you, and they dont, even after you use the "soft" manner, u will feel the anger inside you. and then, once the anger cumulates and then suddenly, "BOOOM!" there goes everything. u will start screaming your head of telling them to shut their holes (happened to me today...twice). and then, ppl will say that u are bossy, stupid, lame, self centered, selfish and wutever they can think of. sometimes, they might even call u to fcuk off, fcuk u and other colourful words. and u will have to bear with it cos u need them inside the performance. tough?  this is tougher. when u are practising halfway, when everyone IS actually practising, there comes an a$$hole who will say sumthing like "what if i dunno how to do on that day?" or "wut if i forget my steps?" or "do u think ppl will listen?" or worst "this is lame" or "this is wasting my time" or simply "this sucks". and then, ppl who WERE practising will agree with that a$$hole and then the whole practise will end up with nothing.  after everything, the real day for the performance comes. eventually, everyone will do their parts. however, there will always be someone who screws up everything. and if the whole performance fails or screwed up, the students will laugh (sarcasticly, refuses to clap etc), the teachers will blame you (leader) for not practising enough, not serious, blah blah. and then, the performers will blame u for writing a lame script/chose a stupid song/didnt practise enough. and then, there would be one bigger a$$hole who will say, its becos its jia hoong's idea. thats why its lame.  i wanna breathe!

      hey ppl  i woke up this morning (11.45..considering it before 12, so i guess its still morning) and i was thinkin really hard bout sumthing. its sumthing weird i just realised.  take my kitchen's basin for example. its actually two basins next to each other but there is only one tap. so, my sister and i used to fight to wash the plates first. and of cos', we end up me putting the soap while she washs it away. now, its no longer like that. the basin now has two taps. one for each side. just that, there is only one person washing the plates now, which is me since my sis is in sg.  take my room for example too. my room has two beds. the room actually belongs to my bro and i. now that my bro always sleeps in my moms room (god knows why), the room with two beds belongs to only one person who doesnt move much from his initial sleeping position. weird?  not to forget, my sis' room used to be a crowded room. its a small room, where 3 people used to sleep in it (my sis, my aunt and i when i was bout 4 years old). i slept there for almost 9 years. and now when i have my own room, the room belong sot my sis and aunt. my sis doesnt stay in this hse anymore so the room belongs to my aunt now. however, my aunt is seldom home these days. so, the once-a-crowded room has become an empty-and-dead room.  aint it funny?

       hey ppl...   im really sorry! i havent been blogging for the past few days..and boy, a lot has happened to me lately. so, here u are, reading bout my life.   lets start with monday. on monday, it was one of the most embarrassing day of my entire life. i swear it was that bad. ian and i were supposed to lead the prefects and librarians for the oath taking. so, i was supposed to say, "UP" as in their hands will be positioned and in stand -by mode for the oath. however, things screwed up when i started the oath (which was "WE, the librarians and the prefects of ssb...") with "WE" instead of "UP". so, the prefects and librarians were all puzzled and all said "huh?" and all turned back and looked at me. and obviously, bestarians were laughing (i mean, it would be a MIRACLE if they didnt) and according to ian, pengetua gave me the "hey-stupid-u-read-it-wrongly-and-i-wonder-how-u-became-the-head-librarian" look. so, i realised my mistake and i said "sorry" with my hands up and did the "i surrender" gesture and i was laughing at my silly mistake. then i quickly said "UP" and said the oath as it was supposed to be with ian. then, i stepped down from stage quickly and felt my face going red. and u know what was the worst thing? weng keong, the EX head boy (yes, the word EX is highlighted, bold, underlined TWICE) said he wants to talk to me about my attitude and said i wasnt serious enough to become head librarian. (like he was...i mean, even if i am not serious enough, who is he to give me a talk on MY attitude? even loris, the ex head librarian, didnt say anything. like what? he is my father or something?). of cos' jho isnt stupid. i said "sure, how bout tomorrow break?". and he agreed. hehe..i didnt turn up and just left him there waiting.   nothing really happened on tuesday. however, on wednesday, it was interact meeting. we came up with some game to like, get-to-know interactors. the game is like, everyone writes a question on a piece of paper, then at random, we will choose someone to pick a question and answer it loudly. but, i made a rule that the questions asked must be something that will make u know more bout the person. for instance, questions like "do u think u are sexy? if yes, why?" are accepted. however, questions like "do u think jia hoong is lame?" is SO NOT accepted. and yes, u guess it correctly. some a$$hole asked that question. i was like sungguh terasa towards the question. and guess which smart a$$ who followed my instructions asked that question? of cos its soon jeat, the  dog who thinks he can sing (just because he is in the choir) but seriously, he cant. i mean, not because im like mad at him because of the question (well...maybe a little) but, my point is, have u heard him singing that jay chou song on installation day? i swear in the name of my grandmother that jay chou sings a million times better than him (although i dun like jay chou).   thursday, which was yesterday, was like SO cool!! i met twins!! yay!! they were so cute!! ah sa wore this pink top which bares her back but she was wearing a black singlet inside. ah gill was wearing this white top. they look so darn cute! then jaycee looks exactly like the father...which means, in another words, ugly. wilson chen looks ok..i mean, he looks really "cool" as in both cool looking and quiet.   and here, today, we practised our interact presentation for a fund raising activity on monday (16/8). we are gonna sing "i knew i loved u" (my fave song!! yay!!) and "di persimpangan dilema"..some malay some by Nora. its kinda nice actually...hehe. but i hope it wouldnt rain on that day though.   the form threes trial is starting next week. this reminds me of last year, when i was in form 3. we were all so tensed and nervous then. however, now that pmr is over, its really nice when we think back bout those stupid lame days. i remember that a few friends and i were like memorizing some stupid history facts and not a single question was asked on that chapter. the form 3s this year are really dedicated and hardworking. everywhere u'll see them, they would be holding a book. and every morning, they would go to the canteen and sit and study together. yes..its THAT serious.   and here i am, now, writing my blog while recording some songs into MD for my sis. she siad she is bored in sg and she wanted to borrow my twins' cd. of cos' i said NO! i mean, i listen to twins everyday. if she is gonna take it away from me, how am i gonna survive?? how can i live without twins? so, i told her i would record all the songs into her MD and when mom visits her, which is tomorrow, she would pass it to her. and guess what? i'll be home alone during the weekends and on monday. well..not exactly home alone, cos grandma and grandpa would be here but, kinda "alone" as in i'll be by myself but not that "alone" but...forget bout it.   hmm..i guess i'll stop here. i have tonnes of homework to do. guess thats my only agenda for the weekends. later. ciaoz and nitey..   (._.)v peace!!
