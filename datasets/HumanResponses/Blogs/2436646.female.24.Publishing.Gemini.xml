          It doesn't interest me what you do for a living.      I want to know what you ache for, and if you dare to dream of meeting           your heart's longing.      It doesn't interest me where or what or with whom you have studied.      I want to know what sustains you from the inside when all else falls away.      I want to know if you can be alone with yourself,      and if you truly like the company you keep in the empty moments.  - Oriah Mountain Dreamer

      I have issues. A week ago, I didn't want him. Now, I can't stop thinking about him. It's like I've taken some love potion. The Brett love potion, sure to knock any gal back in love with her ex. I mean he really is a wonderful man. And there were times when I thought that this was it, he was the man for me. So, what does he think of this new found feeling? Confused and scared and happy.  We are back to dating, not exclusive dating, but together nonetheless. I love him and am still in love with him. How can I ignore that?

      The ice is thin come on dive in  underneath my lucid skin  the cold is lost forgotten  Hours pass days pass time stands still  light gets dark and darkness fills  my secret heart forbidden...  I think you worried for me then  the subtle ways that I'd give in but I know  you liked the show   tied down to this bed of shame  you tried to move around the pain but oh  your soul is anchored   The only comfort is the moving of the river  You enter into me, a lie upon your lips  offer what you can, I'll take all that I can get  only a fool's here...   I don't like your tragic sighs  as if your god has passed you by well hey fool  that's your deception  your angels speak with jilted tongues  the serpent's tale has come undone you have no  strength to squander   The only comfort is the moving of the river  You enter into me, a lie upon your lips  offer what you can, I'll take all that I can get  only a fool's here to stay  only a fool's here to stay  only a fool's here...

      She said, "Forget what you have to do, pretend there is nothing outside this room." Like an idea she came to me, but she came too late or maybe too soon. I said, "Please try not to love me. Close your eyes, I'm turning on the light. And you know I have no vacancy and it's awfully cold outside tonight."  ****************   I'm moving this week to a bigger place, a bigger apartment. So I've graduated college. Staying in Knoxville in order to work at a job I already dislike. I stayed for a boy, a boy I knew I did not love but was too afraid to make the leap into the "real world" alone. Now, the boy is no longer in my life because I mustered enough courage to leave him. So, I'm moving to a bigger place, a bigger apartment even though I have one less belonging.

      "I love you," she slowly prrred into his ear with her sweet southern drawl. "But I don't want anything from you except for right now. I want this moment, today. Let tomorrow worry about tomorrow."  "You don't love me," he whispered back. "You never have and you never will. But I'm in love you, so I will give you all of my moments. I'll worry about tomorrow now while you lay in my arms."  And with that, he held her as she thought of today and he thought of tomorrow.

      So, so you think you can tell Heaven from Hell, blue skies from pain, can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail a smile from a veil. Do you think you can tell? And did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts, hot ashes for trees, hot air for a cool breeze, cold comfort for change. Did you exchange a walk-on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?   How I wish, how I wish you were here. We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl year after year, running over the same old ground, and how we found, the same old fears, Wish you were here.  But I don't know who you is...

      i wish he could read this and know:  Your day breaks, your mind aches You find that all the words of kindness linger on  When she no longer needs you  She wakes up, she makes up She takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry She no longer needs you  And in her eyes you see nothing No sign of love behind the tears cried for no one A love that should have lasted years  You want her, you need her And yet you don't believe her when she says her love is dead You think she needs you  And in her eyes you see nothing No sign of love behind the tears cried for no one A love that should have lasted years  You stay home, she goes out She says that long ago she knew someone but now he's gone She doesn't need him  Your day breaks, your mind aches There will be times when all the thing she said will fill your head You won't forget her  And in her eyes you see nothing No sign of love behind the tears cried for no one A love that should have lasted years

      I saw a breathe-taking rainbow on the way to work today. It was enormous and absolutely gorgeous. I think it's the little things in life like seeing a beautiful rainbow or a captivating full moon that makes everything so right.

      Of course he isn't graduating. Why would I think he would? Why do I always set myself up for disappointment? But I'm not his mom and the hell if I'm going to start acting like one. He is a grown man and can deal with his own shit.   Here's my song of the day -   It's coming on Christmas  They're cutting down trees  They're putting up reindeer  And singing songs of joy and peace  Oh I wish I had a river I could skate away on   But it don't snow here  It stays pretty green  I'm going to make a lot of money  Then I'm going to quit this crazy scene   Oh I wish I had a river  I could skate away on  Oh I wish I had a river so long  I would teach my feet to fly  Oh I wish I had a river  I could skate away on  I made my baby cry.  He tried hard to help me  He put me at ease  Lord, he loved me so naughty  Made me weak in the knees  I wish I had a river I could skate away on  I'm so hard to handle  I'm selfish and I'm sad  Now I've gone and lost the best baby  That I ever had  I wish I had a river  I could skate away on  Oh I wish I had a river so long  I would teach my feet to fly  Oh I wish I had a river  I made my baby say goodbye   It's coming on Christmas  They're cutting down trees  They're putting up reindeer  And singing songs of joy and peace  I wish I had a river  I could skate away on.   Oh what would Joni do?

      I've been out walking  I don't do too much talking these days,  these days.  These days I seem to think a lot  About the things that I forgot to do  And all the times I had the chance to.  I've stopped my rambling,  I don't do too much gambling these days,  these days.  These days I seem to think about  How all the changes came about my ways  And I wonder if I'll see another highway.  I had a lover,  I don't think I'll risk another these days,  these days.  And if I seem to be afraid  To live the life that I have made in song  It's just that I've been losing so long.  I've stopped my dreaming,  I won't do too much scheming these days,  these days.  These days I sit on corner stones  And count the time in quarter tones to ten.  Please don't confront me with my failures,  I had not forgotten them.

      Woke up, fell out of bed, dragged a combed across my head,  Found my way downstairs and drank a cup, and looking up I noticed I was late, Grabbed my coat, and grabbed my hat, made the bus in seconds flat, Found my way upstairs and had a smoke, and somebody spoke and I went into a dream.  Is it happy hour yet?

      Please explain to me why men suck? And, more importantly, why do they never listen? Maybe it is just this particular man in my life at the moment or maybe you males are in this secret club where you learn to block women out. Is that it? Ugh, I am fed up with it all so I'm moving to Tanzania.   And I can't stop smoking.

      T-minus 11 days till I am thrust out into the "real world." I have been working for this moment for so long that I am numb to it now. I'm not excited or dreadful or anxious or even eager, just kinda numb.   Maybe if I wasn't working already, I would be more jazzed about it. I dunno.

      Work is manageable. Brett is fabulous. Knoxville is tolerable. And Life, well, life is doing OK.   You do what you gotta do. And for the time being I am just going to float through life. Any day now I could get that call that brings me on down to FL. Until then, I guess I could settle with a job in Nashville. Only the good lord knows.

I hate how they treat me, I hate the work I do, I hate how they expect me to know exactly what is going on at all times but yet will never include me in any meetings or work details and I absolutely, 100% completely and utterly fed up with my boss.   oh for the love, is it Friday yet?????

      Well, V-Day was wonderful. Truly, truly sparkling diamonds wonderful. Now, I must begin the packing and moving crap AGAIN. Why do I continue to torture myself with constant moving?!?

      OK, here's the truth. Still unemployed, slightly thinking about moving back to Knoxville just so I can be with Brett, and, um, had this HUGE knock down drag out fight with Pop. My mom had to break us apart cause we were in each other faces saying how much we hated one another. I'm not a violent person, but I have never wanted to hit someone as much as I did at that moment. But, fists were not thrown.   So, now I am just trying to find a job, anything at all (well that isn't true because I did turn down a few job offers cause the pay and work sucked) so I can move out of the house. You know that saying about always being able to go home? Well it's a sham. You can't go home. Cause when you do, you realize you're to damn old to be living with your parents.

I can take over the world if I wanted!).    Anyways, check out this article I wrote. I'm kinda proud of myself that my story made the front cover.   urlLink http://pr.utk.edu/alumnus/alumarticle.asp?id=474   So if anyone is ever in the Sarasota area, look me up. Later!

      I don't know where I'm goin but I sure know where I've been hanging on the promises in songs of yesterday. An' I've made up my mind, I ain't wasting no more time but here I go again, here I go again.  Tho' I keep searching for an answer I never seem to find what I'm looking for. Oh Lord, I pray you give me strength to carry on 'cos I know what it means to walk along the lonely street of dreams.      Here I go again on my own     goin' down the only road I've ever known.     Like a hobo I was born to walk alone.     An' I've made up my mind, I ain't wasting no more time.  Just another heart in need of rescue waiting on love's sweet charity an' I'm gonna hold on for the rest of my days 'cos I know what it means to walk along the lonely street of dreams.      Here I go again on my own     goin' down the only road I've ever known.     Like a hobo I was born to walk alone.     An' I've made up my mind, I ain't wasting no more time     but here I go again, here I go again,     here I go again, here I go.  An' I've made up my mind, I ain't wasting no more time.

      Without you The ground thaws The rain falls The grass grows  Without you The seeds root The flowers bloom The children play The stars gleam The poets dream The eagles fly  Without you The earth turns The sun burns But I die Without you  Without you The breeze warms The girl smiles The cloud moves  Without you The tides change The boys run The oceans crash The crowds roar The days soar The babies cry  Without you The moon glows The river flows But I die Without you  The world revives Colors renew But I know blue Only blue Lonely blue Within in me, blue Without you  Without you The hand gropes The ear hears The pulse beats  Without you The eyes gaze The legs walk The lungs breathe  The mind churns The heart yearns The tears dry Without you Life goes on But I'm gone Cause I die Without you

      Bell bottom blues, you made me cry. I don't want to lose this feeling. And if I could choose a place to die It would be in your arms.   Do you want to see me crawl across the floor to you? Do you want to hear me beg you to take me back? I'd gladly do it because I don't want to fade away. Give me one more day, please. I don't want to fade away. In your heart I want to stay.   It's all wrong, but it's all right. The way that you treat me baby. Once I was strong but I lost the fight. You won't find a better loser.   Do you want to see me crawl across the floor to you? Do you want to hear me beg you to take me back? I'd gladly do it because I don't want to fade away. Give me one more day, please. I don't want to fade away. In your heart I want to stay.   Bell bottom blues, don't say goodbye. I'm sure we're gonna meet again, And if we do, don't you be surprised If you find me with another lover.   Do you want to see me crawl across the floor to you? Do you want to hear me beg you to take me back? I'd gladly do it because I don't want to fade away. Give me one more day, please. I don't want to fade away. In your heart I want to stay.   I don't want to fade away. Give me one more day please. I don't want to fade away. In your heart I long to stay.

      Every time I look at you the world just melts away All my troubles all my fears dissolve in your affection You’ve seen me at my weakest but you take me as I am And when I fall you offer me a softer place to land  I get mad so easy but you give me room to breathe No matter what I say or do ‘cause you’re too good to fight about it  Even when I have to push just to see how far you’ll go You won’t stoop down to battle but you never turn to go  You stay the course you hold the line you keep it all together You’re the one true thing I know I can believe in You’re all the things that I desire you save me you complete me You’re the one true thing I know I can believe  I love you, Brett Michael Kelley.

      I'm sad, I'm happy, I'm happy/sad.  I'm trying it on my own and I don't think it's working out too well. I'm really starting to get tired of working 6 days a week, 10 hours a day. Yeah, sure overtime is good and all but in 4 months they're gonna put me on salary. Being on salary, when it comes to retail, sucks. I'll be getting a raise but working more. So, absolutely no social life.   And it also sucks that the idea was put in my head of a new possibility. I mean, I really do love the people I work with and somewhat what I do. But I think I made myself not see any of the bad things about the job because it had to work, I had to make it work b/c there was no other alternative. Well, now there is possibly another alternative.   So, this is why it isn't neccassarily good when good things pop into your life.  Ugh, that doesn't make any sense.

      Well, I've been in Charlotte for 2 weeks now. It's a pretty good town, I think I'll stay. Brett and I are marvelous, more in love each day. I canceled my Knoxville cell # so if you need any of my new info, e-mail me (brynnahall@yahoo.com) and I will e-mail it to you.   My dilemma of the day is furniture. Why is it so freaking hard to buy furniture! Could someone please just come to Charlotte and decorate for me? I will supply the $$, you supply the talent (the talent to accessorize!).   Oh, and I went to the coolest thing last weekend. The Charlotte orchestra holds a free concert on Sundays at the amphitheater in SouthPark. Everyone brings their wine and goodies and have a little picnic while listening to beautiful live music. It's so very cool.  But something that is not cool is rain. Rain, rain, rain, that's all it does here is rain. It's rained every day for like 2 weeks. Every day I have been here, it has rained. I'm tired of the rain. Bring on the sun.   Well, screw the rain and the sun, bring on the happy hour.

      Possibly where I will be living...   urlLink Courtney Oaks   What do you think?  For the time being, I am staying with my boyfriend's parents. They are sooo extemely nice and helpful. If Brett and I were ever to get married, his mom, Angela, would be the best mother-in-law. She is just a good person, the kind of person you feel comfortable around as soon as you meet her. (Oh and did I mention that Brett's step-dad is my new boss? yeah seems like it would be wierd, but not so much!)  I love Charlotte. For anyone looking for a new city to relocate to, Charlotte is for you. There is something cool for everyone. I mean Uptown is fabulous with that big, urban downtown feel, while South Park is rich and expensive but oh so cool to hang out. So, for those looking, come visit me in Charlotte. We'll have a blast.

      The big 2-4. Not too shabby, all in all it was a pretty good birthday. It was my last day at Westfield too and everyone was just so nice. They made me feel very special, and it's nice knowing I will be missed. I'm really going to miss everyone there.   But, I am very excited about the move to Charlotte and the new job. My new boss called me yesterday just to say he was looking forward to me joining the company. It was took me by surprise that he would call just to say they all were excited I took the job. Very cool.

      Three Cheers for Moving!  Sunday Sunday Sunday. . . is the big day that I will be moving to Charlotte, NC. Going up there with just the clothes on my back (and the 4 suitcases I'm cramming into my lil car). My new marketing job at Timeplanner starts June 14. So, this whole next week I will be scouring the city for the perfect apartment, furniture and everything else in between.   I think what I am most excited about is being with my honey again and getting to learn and experience a new city together. :)

         This&nbsp;next song is&nbsp;dedicated to those wonderful girls in Charlotte who have rejuvenate my girl power feelings. :) Abbey and Mandy - ya'll are the best - thanks for listening to my crazy work rants, jamming out at karaoke and basically for just being my friend.  (Oh and Tim can just suck my balls!)      What would you think if I sang out of tune,  Would you stand up and walk out on me.  Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song,  And I'll try not to sing out of key.  I get by with a little help from my friends,  I get high with a little help from my friends,  Going to try with a little help from my friends.   What do I do when my love is away.  (does it worry you to be alone)  How do I feel by the end of the day  (are you sad because you're on your own)  No I get by with a little help from my friends,   Do you need anybody,  I need somebody to love.  Could it be anybody  I want somebody to love.   Would you believe in a love at first sight,  Yes I'm certain that it happens all the time.  What do you see when you turn out the light,  I can't tell you, but I know it's mine.   Oh I get by with a little help from my friends,  Yes I get by with a little help from my friends,  With a little help from my friends.   You gals are the best! Thanks for befriending me in this crazy town (and workplace!)   P!   PS - Brett you are still #1 in my book too!

      Well, Brett and I have made a big decision. And, yes, it does involve the m-word. No, not that m-word! Get real, I am way too young for that. We are moving in together! Granted it won't happen anytime in the near, near future, we are simply planning ahead (which might be a bad idea because I don't know how much longer I can fool Brett into thinking I'm not a horrible, society reject!).  In other news, work is work is work. Sure I am gaining some experience that somewhat resembles what I ultimately want to do with my life (teach university-level PR) but the downfall is that it sucks. And one of my bosses is by far the biggest pricks ever. Oh well, C'est la vie!  All in all, life is good. Brett and I are wonderful. Abbey totally rocks my world (even though she is the most unusual person I have ever met! haha, j/k). And, my momma is coming to visit me next week.  Hope everyone has a great day!  Zip it in and zip it out! ~b
