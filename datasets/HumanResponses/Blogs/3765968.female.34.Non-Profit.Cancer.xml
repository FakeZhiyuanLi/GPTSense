      When exactly did we switch from a culture of hope to one of fear?  What was the precise moment?  Maybe when the towers collapsed?  Or was it a far more insidious trigger?   All I know is, we've become so fearful.  And I don't like it.

      It's already been proven to us that our votes don't REALLY count.  Not in the way we used to think they did.  I believe that most Americans are jaded, and truly don't think they can make a difference in any way.  Well I beg to differ.  If 65 million of us can mobilize to make phone calls in one night to "elect" the next American Idol, then I believe that many, many more of us can mobilize to change the way this government operates.  And I'm talking about everything from the electoral process to the way taxes are collected.  I firmly believe it ALL needs to be overhauled.  It ain't workin', folks.  And it clearly ain't workin'for the average Jane or Joe just making ends meet.    The American Dream?  I think it's easier for an immigrant to achieve it than for those of us who've lived here all our lives and paid taxes.  I'm not against immigration.  I'm all for people getting out of oppressive countries and making a better life for themselves.  I just think (and I will harp on this until the cows come home)that we, the people of the United States, who have been giving and giving to our country, have to demand our share.  NOW.  Let's go.

      I want this government to Bail Out America.  Seriously.    $140 billion is given to corporations because they are having hard times.  Our defense technology is given to other countries.  We are spending billions outside of this country.  What about us?  Most of my friends are having to work two or three jobs just to get by.  A good friend of mine who was making a comfortable six figures in 1999 has just declared bankruptcy and can't make ends meet.  Others have lost their homes and can't even get apartments.  What do they think they will accomplish?  Creating a nation of homeless people isn't my idea of what this country is all about.  So, I'm telling our leaders - it's time to put the money back into THIS country and its people.  Forgive us our debts.  Wipe out the credit system.  Let us get back on our feet.  Let's organize and send our leaders a clear message.  More later.

      This from a friend of mine who received the following email from the Democratic National Committee:   ************************************ Take Action: Bush Ad Puts Hitler Alongside John Kerry   Dear Elaine:  It isn't often that we'd ask you to go to George W. Bush's campaign website. But every single American should go to georgewbush.com immediately and watch the disgusting ad the Bush/Cheney campaign has featured on the front page.  Titled "The Faces of John Kerry's Democratic Party," the ad features Adolf Hitler alongside Democrats, including John Kerry. President Bush's campaign has relied on negative attacks against Kerry, but this is a new low.  We've always said the Bush campaign would do anything to win, but even we are shocked that they've sunk this low. It's bizarre. It's outrageous. And we're not going to stand for it.  If President Bush has any decency at all, he'll remove this hateful ad from his website immediately.  ****************************************  Interesting. Has anyone seen this ad?  I am going to check it out now.
