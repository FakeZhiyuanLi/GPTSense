      Slept at 10 last night. That's something I haven't done in such a long time. I actually can't remember the last time I went to bed before midnight. There's just so many better things to do than sleep. It just seems like a wate of time. Guess it finnally caught up with me. Woke up at half past 11 the next morning. A good 13 1/2 hours of sleep. Funnily enough it wasn't as refreshing as I would have thought it would have been.  I could actually stay awake throughout the lecture today. Can't say the same thing about paying attention though. That's what getting enough Zs can do for you. I must study econ tomorrow. Yes. Must. That's the power of suggestion. Saying and thinkng it are two totally different things when you turn them into action.  Saying that you MUST instead of Saying that you will TRY. Now I know. So I MUST complete the first three topics tomorrow. Not that I've got any better things to do. Yes, I know it's ambitious considering my procrastinative past. But I MUST do it. After all, I am answering it MYSELF. And lying to yourself is far worse than lying to anyone else, wouldn't you agree?

      Oh man, I got this headache. Been writing to much. First the marketing project, then the law assignment. I think I've written more that I did the whole of last semester! Must be the compute  screen. But I can't help it. I'm addicted to the pc. Oh what am I to do...

      Isn't it amazing how you can do nothing the whole day and at the end of it feel like that time just flew past you? Like it didn't happen at all? That's what happened to me today. Or to be more accurate, yesterday. My whole family went out of town today and I was home alone for the better part of the day.  So I woke up at half past ten. Watched a bit of tv and finally got a shower and dressed at twelve. Spent the rest of the day not doing nothing much. Just switched between the tv and pc. Whoosh. There went the time. And now it's 2 in the morning. Good thing I don't have class tomorrow or else I'd be sleep walking again.  Well. that's it for now.

      Well, I have this afflication called shyness. Everytime I talk to strangers, especially to one of the opposite sex, I turn into jello. I can't think, I start to tremble and I basically just freeze up. It doesn't happen all the time nowadays but it happened today at the YEN meeting.  I had to tell genevieve that I hadn't receive the invitation to the club mailing list yet. I though I could do it without any trouble but I was obviously wrong. I suppose that I care too much about what others think of me and my personality and brain just shuts down. She was trying to be nice but I didn't react to her being nice to me very well at all. I hope I didn't look too much like a dweeb.  But I'm working on this problem. That's one of the main reason that I joined yen in the first place. That is, to force myself into situations where I would have no choice but to interact with strangers, especially those from the opposite gender. I mean, if I want to get anwhere in life, I can't do it on my own. It's not to bad with people whom I know well, but there is still that niggling fear inside of me. That's why I've never had the nerve to get into any relationship.  You have no idea how frustrating it is to want something so bad but are to god damned afraid to just reach out and get it. No matter what happens, I  WILL  overcome this  disability , if you will. And the only way to do that is through increased interaction.  The other problem I have is that of positive thinking which directly affects my motivation. I don't want to say it as it's too overused but its the truth. It's all my parents' fault. Especially my mom. She's just so negative ALL the time. It might seem unfillial (I'm not known for that) to say this but it's all to do with her society and upbringing. They aren't generally known for their achievements. Now she's passed it on to me. The only positive thing is that now that I'm aware of this shortcoming, I can work towards eliminating it. I Have to be smart about it.  Talked to the yen guy I met through darren. Damn. I can't recall his name. He's a total "Adam Knoo" convert. It might be unwise to turn evangelical for anything but in this case it's a positive thing. he should know that fanatic behaviour has a knack of turning people off. But the thing is that he made me realise how negative in my thoughts I've been lately. How small I've been thinking. So negative I am disgusted with myself. I will stop using the word "tyr" and use the word "MUST". It's amazing how much difference a word and thought makes in your life. So I MUST come up with a study and work schedule on sunday and I MUST follow through with that schedule. There! That's settled then. I paradigm shift in actions and thought.

      So there was a  urlLink YEN  meeting today after the marketing project meeting. Went with darren, richard & sky. It was ok, I suppose. The video on the previous orientation was rather disorientating. Gave me a headache. Someone should teach that cameraman how to hold a camcorder. They began with updates for the previous events that the club had been conducting. They also showed a video clip of the official launch of the YEN with the us and uk ambassadors and the minister of state. I guess the exco wanted to emphasize the legitamacy of the club.  There was a briefing on the upcoming events. Signed up for the Cashflow game organising commitee. First time I did anything like that. Of course it helped that darren also joined and that john was the project manager. I'm thinking that if I'm to expand my horizons, I should do more of these activities. Get to know more people, increase my profile in the club community.  I also had joined the PR department during the previous meeting.  Well, other than that it was a pretty uneventful day.

      Well, in the last seventy two hours, I've had 14 hours of sleep. Had 4 last night and 2 the night before. Why, might you ask have I had so little sleep? I've been tossing and turning in bed trying to get to sleep till the wee hours of the morn. Just can't seem to get to sleep. Lots of thoughts were coming into and out of my mind.  The economics lecturer was pretty fast yesterday (no suprise there). For a few minutes there, I sat in the lecture theatre feeling as if someone had put a pillow over my head, trying to stifle me, but only in the intellectual sense. But thankfully I snapped out of it early enough to grasp the bulk that the lecturer was teaching.  Note: Never have only two hours of sleep before another econs lecture again. In fact, it's best to go over the lecture notes beforehand, preferably twice. It'll make everything go smoother during the lecture.  Oh and I think I got the real iq, which is 128. Nothing spectacular but at least it's in the 97th percentile. Pretty darned decent. In the gifted but not quite genius range. But lest I pat myself on the back, I should stop to remember that even the most intelligent person in the world would be useless to himself and the world if he procrastinates too god damned much.  Well, in hindsight, I would have prefered to have not learnt about iq tests. Personnally, I think they're much more trouble than they're worth. That's the last I'll write on  that  particular subject.  Well, what else have happened the past few day? Spent the better part of the day at school doing the marketing project (situational analysis & SWOT). Gonna go to school tomorrow to type it all out with the rest as we only wrote out a rough copy of it today.  Well, that's about it. *YAWN*. I guess it's about time to catch some quality shut eye time.

      Took  urlLink this  IQ test and guess what. I'm a genius. Heh. It's probably rigged so that everyone who takes it will get a high score. Took it twice and got an average of 150. Heh heh. Well, at least it's a wee bit of fun. Don't you just love taking these pointless test? The stupider they seem, the better right? Hey if anyone out there knows of any good quiz site, drop  urlLink me  a line ok.  Tried to do some reading but ended up taking a nap. Here's a tip. Never study while lying in bed. Especially when you have a head cold, like I had today. *Sniff* *Sniff*. Augh. I feel so damned tired cos of this god forsaken cold. Hate it when I come down with a cold outta the blue. But then again, that's what you get when you don't get enough sleep.  Can't help it. I rediscovered  urlLink championship manager 4  two days ago. I'm hooked again. Played it till  three thirty in the morning yesterday. Iknow, I know, it's not a good idea but it's been a while since I've been obsessed with anything. Feels kinda good. Except for the cold of course.  Well, off to sleep now I guess. Or maybe a spot of cm4....

      Keep telling myself to pick myself up from the floor. But you know what? My mind is not connected properly to my physical self. Gotta stop all this procrastination. The deadlines are looming. It's difficult to get motivated. Oh how am I going to do all this work? Argh!  Well, I should at least start. Wasted time the last three days. Three perfetly good days. And most of today. Well, I should start with the simplest topic. That would be to read the marketing notes. The I could move on to commercial law; then accounts and the toughest, economics. Geez for someone like me, I should really not be so wishy washy (as kings put it).  Well, going to start reading now. Wish me luck.

      Well, i was just in one of my rhetoric moods just now. I was thinking of how sad it was that good friends can grow apart as you grow up.  You gain new perspectives as you grow and those might now be the same as your friends. Like you're in different realities. Sometimes you grow apart because of differeing views and sometimes it's because of circumstances. Some of which are not under your control but most of which that are.  Things like gaining a new idealogical beliefs, new social groups or just something as simple as getting a new job. Any of which can cause you to not make contact as often as you would like. I used to believe that it was their fault for not keeping in touch. But then i realized that I was as much at fault as anyone else in my life.  People walk in and walk out of your life. You can try to keep them from walking out but ultimately, it's their choice. Guess that's why you have to choose your friends carefully. But then again, if you are too guarded in your choices, you might be artificially restricting yourself. Ah the choices we all make.  I've had many good people in my life. It's sad to reminisce on the good times past as you know the chances of regaining those timeas are slim to none. So there's no use dwelling on them. But you don't want to discount their value in helping to shape you into the person that you are today. And yet, you don't want to let them hold you back from become the person that you're going to be tomorrow. Sigh.  This doesn't happen much when you're a teenager but it starts when you reach adulthood. You wish to be as carefree as you were then. Letting your parents worry for you. Reality was just for other people. You lived in a cocoon, in your own world.  Ah the good old days.

      Well, took the test today. Can't say that i was that bad but it wasn't that good either. I KNOW i got at LEAST 3 wrong outta 20. So that's 3% of my grade down the drai. Sigh. Well, I wasn't really motivated to study for it. The accounting subject is actually conceptually simple but deceptively so as the the question that come up are anything but.  Well, spent the rest of the day on my marketing project and I suppose I'm gonna catch up on the economic reading after this post. Argh.  S o  m u c h  t o  r e a d.  I think I'm never gonna be able to finish them. But as they say, a journey of a thousand miles... And this is just the second semester. It's just gonna pile up more and more each semester. Guess I better buck up huh.  Well, right after one more movie. Somebody slap me...  Ok Ok... I'll get right on reading. No use dilly dalying...

      Oh shit. It's after midnight so that  mean it's monday. The Accounts test is on tuesday. That's technically tomorrow. Shit. I haven't even touched the books yet. I'm a master procrasticator. My mind's telling me to start studying but my body just won't respond.  What am I to do... Ok gonna go to sleep, wake up and then study all day. Ok, that sound's like a plan.

      Well, saturday and sunday  came and went. It was national day yesterday. Same old stuff i.e. parade, patriotic songs blaring from the tv and flags everywhere (though there aren't as meany  this year as there were in previious years).  I just can't think of why people are so happy this year. I mean because of all the doom and gloom resulting from the bad economic situation. Maybe people just want an easy out, even if it's just a temporary one, from the harshness of reality.  Good thing for me, I'm still studying. And according to my economics lecturer, by the time I  graduate, the job situation should be recovered or at least pretty mush recovered. Not that I will be looking for a job. Hopefully,  urlLink spinedge  will have been successful by then, and I will be able to concentrate on that and other stuff like (cross my fingers) real etate investing. In case you don't know, I have been heavily influenced by the author  urlLink robert kiyosaki .  Ok, what did i do on saturday? Play pool of course! My weekly staple of semi-physical activity. Didn't win as many times as I would have liked, but then again, we all have our bad days. Went to kino before that. Boy it was crowded there. Probably because of the holiday and the storewide 20% discount they had that day cos of  their 4th anniversary. Could hardly move about there. Reminded me why I don't relish crowds. Note to self: weekdays are better for visiting kino.  And on the way back home  urlLink kumar  was narrating to kings and me of how he was dealing with his "fatal attraction" ex girlfriend. Heh heh well, some people had ALL the luck. That chick is one screwed up gal. Even her cousin doesn't like her. Ok nuff gossip.  And today? Well, woke up at 1230pm (which is normal for me cos I usually sleep @ 2-3am). Had some cheesecake (my brother's birthday's on monday but my mom bought the cake 2 days too early) and pizza that my mom made. Oh and I had a spinedge meeting at 230. Of course the others were going to be habitually late so I decided to come 20 mins late so that I wouldn't have to wait long (I was right). And another irritating thing. The guy who called the meeting (who lives like 100 metres away from the meeting room) came at 3!! I mean how tardy can people get. Augh! I never! It's as if people nowadays don't give a rats ass about being on time.  Anyways, just watch on tele that real madrid just beat thailand 2-1. And that was it. Nothing too interesting I guess.

      Damn. Time sure flies. Checked my schedule and had the biggest shock. I have an accouting test next tuesday! I guess it kinda crept up on me. Augh! Guess it's time to have a crack at the books. Only consolation's that it's an MCQ test and not a written one.  Darn it. I promised myself at the beginning of the semester that I would get my act together. Well, it's not too late. Only a third of the semester has passed so I'm not too far behind in my reading and stuff. So what now? I'll write up that study schedule I guess. Yeah just as soon as I fininsh that movie... Bad haz Bad, Bad haz.  That richard dude is sure long winded. Once you get him going he keeps on going (like that energizer buny eh). Guess that's what ocs does to you. But then again, not all the ppl who went to ocs are that long winded. I  guess it's just him then. Thank god that's about his only, how shall I put it....glitch? Yeah That's sound about right. So I guess he's ok in my books.  Oh and that accounting lecturer should get a personality. I mean she must rank as one of the not so captivating teachers I;ve had in a long time. And that's putting it kindly.  The marketing project's getting along better now. We're actually getting the research materials. Though I'm finding it a bit tough to find 3G subscription info from european telcos. Richard had it ez with only japan's telcos to do reseach on, which is practically only NTT DoCoMo.  Ok, Enuff ranting for one nite.

      So I was on the subway today when I saw this guy about 10m away standing beside on of the doors. He wuz holding a newspaper and I could see a big advert on the fornt page which had the headline "Todays Best Picks" or something close to that.   So what's so interesting about that you might ask? Well nothing really. Cept for the fact that he was also picking his nose, quite contently so, if I might add... heh heh snicker snicker...  Just goes to show how inadvertant situations can be so farnie....

      Ok, today was ok. Started off irritatingly though. Had a marketing project meeting this afternoon. I swear, some people don't give a horses ass about other people's time. Some people as in one of my marketing project's group member. This particular guy's sense of time is absolutely scewed up.  Exibit A: Yesterday we were supposed to meet at 12pm. What does he do? Smses to inform me that he was gonna be late >> 1230pm. A half an hour came and went. No hide nor hair seen of him. I message him to ask him where he was. he messages me back to say that he was in fact not gonna be able to make it after all. Meaning? Two hours of my time flushed down the drain.  Argh!  Exibit B: Proposed meeting time? 1230pm. Oh this time he actually decided to turn up. At 145pm. Oh I was SO overjoyed to see him! Grrr!   Verdict? GUILTY AS CHARGED!  Ok, what the hell am I gonna do about this joker? He obviously isn't one to be flustered about tardiness.  Ok, enough about that dolt. Well, other than the the lateness of Mr greatness, we (the 4 of us) actually achieved something. Finished the survey form we were supposed to come up with. Gonna let the marketing lecturer review it tomorrow. Hope it's ok bu  it's probably gonna need some revisions. Oh well.  Ok, after the meeting was concluded, I went with 2 of them (minus one great one) to shoot some pool. Won 5 games of 6. Woohoo. Well, I think i'm on a roll here. Gotta love the game of pool eh.  Then after that, went to kino to read the pool book I saw a couple of weeks ago. Phew, time can pass pretty quickly when you're reading. Stopped that at about 7. Coincdentally met fairoz and paul at orchard mrt station. Had a good chat about the stupid gvt's policy on the university intake on the way to tampines. Oh well. Again.  Met Kings at tampines and had dinner at ljs. Had a nice chat on the intricacies of trading via ebay.  Went home at about 10.  Ok that's it for today.

      Damn! Been a long while since I added any new entries (not that anyone would care of course) But hot damn! Lazy bones strikes again. Sometimes I wonder why I bothered to have a blog in the first place.  Well, it's the school holidays now. Finished the exams. I hope to pass all four papers but we all hope for good things don't we. Anyway, the accounts paper was a bust. Same feeling as the stats paper last semester. Probably gonna flunk accounts. But there's always a chance I'll pass eh. heck same thing happened to stats last sm and I passed that one.  So tomorrow, or I should say today, I'm gonna go down to the registry of companies and I'm gonna register a business partnership with kumar. It's been a long time coming I can tell you that much. Gonna call the new company "Epac Trading Company" in honour of the earlier supposed but on hold partnership with the other two future partners for Entrepac. Well, see what happens tomorow then.  Oh and I'm working on tradenet now. Damn I  loathe  programming. But I gave my word that I'll do it and I don't like to break it. Though sometimes there  are  extenuating circumstances. heck, there's always an excuse to not do something eh.

      So another month has gone by. And of course, seeing as how my life is pretty much stagnant, nothing much happened. Well, except for the stuff I'm gonna talk about now.  I finally completed the beta version of the tradenet website. Of course, this was after much dragging of both feet (well, waddaya expect?). Kept adding and improving it. Probably gonna register a domain and get the site up and running by the middle of january 04. The delay being attributed to a lack of funds, and a means of which to transfer it to the web hosting company. My partner is gonna get his credit card in january, so that's when we're gonna set up the site.  And how could I forget the other main thing that happened. I flunked accounting. Oh my god. I flunked. I guess I could see it coming, from the moment I got out of the exam hall after the paper, I pretty much knew. I just flunked with 47 outta 100. I dunno. Is it worse flunking knowing that you are so close to passing or worse is you flunked badly? I'm guessing the former. Well, just cos it's borderline, I put in an appeal to the course coordinator. Not hoping for much but at least there is hope.  On the borght side, I did get distinctions for law and economics. I suppose that if you like a course, youre more motivated to do well in it. But then , you'd like a course if you find it easy to understand. Hmm, a catch 22 situation.  Well, Gonna get the appeal result this week. Crossing my fingers there. Other than those things of note, nothing much has happened. Guess that's it for now. Till next time.

      Well kings has gone and gotten himself a girlfriend. Well smack me silly and turn me inside out. Wouldn't have thought that would happen anytime soon. Goes to show how life can sometimes blindside you when you least expect it.  So there it is. My kemosabe in bachelorhood arms has deserted me. Can't say I blame him though. Except the reason for him to get together with this girl are rather suspect. I'll never be sure whether he got together with her just to prove to himself that he could get a girlfriend or that he is really sincerely into this girl. Only way to find out is to just ask him directly but that would just make our friendship take a weird turn. Oh well.   Don't know how long he'll be with her. Seems to me that this girl is the controlling type. Scolded him for playing pool with me the other weekend. Maybe it's because they're in the 'honeymoon' period of their relationship and she doesn't foeel secure enough with him to let him out of her sight (claws).   Or maybe I'm just over analysing things. Nah.   Bleah.

      Don't you just despise politics? Especially when you don't really need it? It's such a waste of time to deal with.  Case in point, the project groups selections for the research project, for the new semester that has just begun. Everyone is jostling for position so that they can work with the people that they think will help them along in their academic ambitions. That, or they just want to be with people that they think they can work (not argue) with.  I don't see the point. If you are in the 'real' world, you don't often get to select the people that you wish to do projects with. Therefore, in universities, they should just assign people their groups. This would definitely save a lot of time and effort that would otherwise inevitably end with some people being hurt (not that I'm one of them of course).  Oh well, that's my rant for today.

      It's a week and a half till the next semester begins. Man, the holidays flew past in a blink of an eye, didn't they. This is probably the last holiday that I will have to just laze around and do pretty much nothing.  The next holiday, at the end of this year, I'll probably be busy with the DPP project (one big mother of a research project) and with the starting up of the tuition centre. The following holiday, during mid 2005, I'll be in Melbourne at RMIT, for most of that month.  So that doesn't leave much time for breathers in between. Phew! From here on out, it'll be one mad rush. And that's just the beginning of life then.  I look toward it with mixed feelings really. On one hand, it'll be great to be able to start earning my keep. But on the other hand, I don't want to leave the security of school so soon.  But time marches on. And there is nothing anyone can do about it. All I can do is to face it head on and hope that life doesn't chew me up and spit me out. But that's just being pessimistic. Remember the glass is half full!

      Kumar came to my place and we discussed the cash flows, based on our judgment and his tuition experience.  Kumar and I went to a couple of place on Monday to scout for possible locations for the tuition centre.   We first went to siglap centre. The place had a good location but the sizes of the units there were not optimal. Besides, the units were mostly taken.   Then we went to roxy square 2. The place was nice but there were no apparent vacant units that was well suited for our purposes, in terms of size.  Finally, we went to katong mall. The place was the best. There were numerous vacant units that were suited for our purposes. So, it is most certain that the tuition centre will be located in that shopping mall. The rent there was also reasonable.  The only problem is that the mall is not very near to a bus stop. It is quite a distance to walk to the nearest bus stop.  We also decided to commence operation in the last quarter of the year as the student take up rate would be most optimal during the holidays and early part of the following year.

      Well K has done it again. He was supposed to some over to my place on Monday to discuss the business plan for the tuition centre. But he pulled a Houdini on me. He doesn't live at home and neither does he stay at his uni hostel all the time.  So that just leaves his cell phone as the easiest avenue to contact he reliably. At least that's the theory. Damn, it's irritating when he does this. Called him about every two hours but didn't have any luck. Guess I'll have to try again tomorrow morning.  On another note, I'll be going down to my dad's office to help solve a computer glitch tomorrow. After which, I'll be able to go down to katong mall to see a shop space that we're considering as a location for the centre. Maybe I'll drop by a couple of other place too. But that'll depend on the weather. It's been beastly hot the past week or so.

      Kumar has invited me to join his new venture, a tuition centre for primary school kids. I agreed. I find new ventures exciting. At this point in my life (at the beginning), I find that service based ventures pose very little risks.  And in addition, K seems to have a good working knowledge of the industry, as a result of his numerous years as a tuition teacher himself. This would definitely be an advantage as I have virtually no first hand knowledge of it personally.  Setting up a tuition centre would only need a minimal startup cost of about 4-8k. Therefore, the risk exposure, in financial terms, is minimal. I have only a few assets (hey, I'm a poor student), so there is little that I will loose if the venture is not successful.  Add to that, the team K has put in place for this venture, I feel confident that this venture will, at the very least, break even.  The situation we find ourselves in is that we need to find a location that is large enough and is within our targeted rental range. Once we do that, we would then be able to address other issues like furnishings, licenses and renovation items.  Wish us luck.  P.S. I will also be starting a blog on my journey into the exciting yet somewhat intimidating world of business. Look out for the announcement soon. Now, less talk and more action!!

      It was Khalid's birthday yesterday, on the 18th. So I called him up and treated him to lunch. Had a good long chat with him about philosophy at LJS.  About 2 hours worth in fact. I rather enjoyed that. Touched on a variety of topic like time, the human consciousness, nature and some other stuff. He's getting to be pretty good at it because of the English literature bachelors degree course he's taking at stansfield college.

      &lt;RANT&gt;  GOD FUCKIN' DAMN IT!!!! I got screwed out of 6 months of my life! The government just decided to cut national service liability period to a maximum of 2 years (from a maximum of 2 1/2 years) for all future enlistees! Argh!!  Doesn't really concern me now cos I finished NS in Dec'02. But it still boils my blood to think that if they had cut the liability period earlier, I would have saved half a god damn year of my time. And I would have gotten out of that shit hole of my Army unit that much sooner.  GOD FUCKIN' DAMN IT!!!!  &lt;/RANT&gt;

      I've been following the 2004  urlLink European football championships  for the past week. I have to say that it has been rather bland so far.   The best gme so far was the one which pitted  urlLink England  against  urlLink France . Now that was an exciting match, although ultimately disappointing, as I'm an England fan (England lost 2-1). The game rekindled memories of the European Champion's League final between  urlLink Manchester United  and  urlLink Bayern Munich  a couple of years ago.  I hope the games become more exciting. It should be so once the knock-out stage of the competition begins as there will not be anymore drab draws. Can't wait for that.

      The timetable for the next semester is out. It's pretty ok. Got Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday "free". I say "free" cos it's not really gonna be free time. There's a shitload of projects to be done this semester.  Two major ones for "entrepreneurial ventures 1" (EV) and "developing professional practice 1" (DPP1). Those two are basically one project courses. Then there's "employment relations" (ER) and "organisational structures and design" (OSD). They're pretty ok woth two minor projects for each course.  Oh, and  urlLink Goh Ai Yat  is going to be taking EV this semester! That's great news cos she's one of the most enthusiastic lecturers by whom I have been fortunate enough to have been taught by.  All in all, I am looking forward to the start o the next semester. I'm getting rather restless during these holidays. So, I can't wait to get busy again.

      Damn. It's a hot HOT day today. Sweltering. I swear you could have fried an egg on the asphalt!  Woke up super early today. At 945am. You might think that it's not really that early at all but do consider that I sleep at 5am (earliest 4am) during term breaks. I usually wake up at 12pm so I lost more than two hours of sleep right there. I don't think I'm a pig because I'm more of a night owl and I only sleep a maximum of 8 hours a day.  Well, after waking up, I went to my dad's office with my mum. Helped to sort out some computer stuff. My dad's office assistant just quit and left the file on the computer in an absolute mess. My cousin s filling in until my dad finds a new assistant, I suppose. Spent about two hours correcting that.  Nothing much after that. Went home after buying some lunch at LJS and spent the rest of the day chilling.

      I just read this  urlLink article , specifically the section referring to the remarks made by  urlLink Bill Cosby . In it he talks about the culture of victimism in America.  This got me to think about the culture of victimism in the civilised world as we know it today. I get tired when I hear people blaming everything but themselves for their less than desired life situations. Or saying that it's meant to be.  In my humble opinion, unless you are mentally incapacitated, you and only yourself, are responsible for the life that you lead. There is no two ways about it.  What is the point of blaming everything for your troubles? Why not get off your @ss and do something about it? I'd like to think that I am doing so through actively taking actions that has a specific life goal in mind.   You can't go anywhere if you don't have anywhere that you want to go to. So I suppose the keys is that you should decide upon a goal that you want to strive towards. But it's not just goal setting that's important. It must be with a sense of discipline that you work to wards your goal with.  Though that by no means guarantees success, success cannot be achieved otherwise.

This movie is on par with classics such as amelie and the pianist. Just breath taking. Definitely in the running to be one of the top ten movies I have watched this year, or ever. Go watch it NOW!

      God damn it. I cut the tip of my right middle finger off while opening a can. I can't remember the last time I bled so much. OWE!   Tip: You should clean your finger under running water but dry it off  as soon as possible if you don't want to keep bleeding. I didn't, and bled under running water for about 10 minutes before I realise what to do. That's cos I haven't cut myself in ages and I was at a loss at hat to do.   Lost quite a bit of blood right there. Must have used like half a box of tissues to get the bleeding to stop. Thank god it finally did.

      Have you ever stopped to think about the concept of time? That's all it actually is, isn't it. A concept formed by man, pretty much as a convenient way to measure moments in an accurate way. And it can be relative. A moment here can be less or more than a moment there, depending on various factors such as relative position and speed of movement of matter. Time is not something that is tangible.  How do you actually prove that time actually exist? Do you really feel it? It it really something that moves forward? Why can't it move in reverse, if it is moving at all.  After pondering this for a while at 4 in the morning (don't ask why I was still awake), I thought of a lateral way to interpret the concept of time. Instead of viewing it as something that is separate of us, it could be said that it is something innate to all reality. Consider this for a moment. If nothing ever changes, does time exist? In my view, time only exists if things change. That probably why things freeze in movies and on television shows when they try to show that time has "stopped".  Therefore, time only exists when matter moves, or evolves, so to speak. We could say that we are still occupying the same space as the dinosaurs did. Take away the application of the concept of time, and it just means that matter moved around a bit which resulted in us, mankind and the world that we know of, at this moment in space. How and why or how long matter took to move around is subsequently irrelevant for all intents and purposes.  That just one of the thought that I have recently been trying to grapple with.

      Well, the examination results came out on Monday, two days ago. I did pretty well this semester. I got a high distinction for "the entrepreneurial process" (EP). But that course was a forgone distinction. But I does feel good to get a HD as it's my first one (sad isn't it?).   Oh and I got distinctions for "methods of organisational research" (MOR) and the one I flunked last semester, "management accounting and business" (MAB). It wasn't as tough this time round. But I suppose if you redo something, it would become easier.  And I managed to get a credit for "organisations and their environment" (OE), no thanks to the uptight course coordinator, vivien wong. She gave my group project a pass. Can you imagine that. A measly pass. Ugh! That shaved off 20% of my grade right there.  So, all in all, it was not such a bad semester at all. And to cap it all off, I'll only have 2 examinations to sit for the next semester! Woohoo!  On a sombre note. H****n didn't pull through her MAB exam. She was doing it as a repeat module so it's not a good thing to fail it. She might get kicked off the programme. God I hope it doesn't some to that. She's a wonderful gal and I would sorely miss her if it should come to that.  N**h also failed OE. But it's not that serious a predicament for him as he hasn't failed any other courses. So he'll just repeat that one course next sem with another three new ones.

      Well, this is it. The last day of the last real school holiday. No many more days to sleep at 5am and wake up at mid day. From tomorrow onwards, it will be one mad rush to do everything.  I think I'm going to chill out today. Maybe I'll go for a cycle to pasir ris park later.  On a different note, Jeremy has opened up a shop at sunshine plaza selling those miniature Japanese anime character figurines. You know, those figurines that are sold at absurdly high prices. One set of five figurines that were about 2 inches tall each were going for $100!  And there are actually quite a number of people who collect these stuff. There was this British NUS lecturer there. The guy must have been over fifty years young. And he was a collector! What a cool way to make a living. Turning your hobby into a business.  Had quite a nice round of pool yesterday with Dylan at beach road. Only down side was the half hour wait to get a table. Busy night, Saturdays. It's been a long time since I managed to beat Dylan so many times. Either he's getting worse or I'm getting better. Hope it's the latter.

My cable ISP had a promotion to sign up for an eighteen month contract in exchange for a $369 mp3 player. Since I wasn't planning on switching ISPs anytime soon, I grabbed hold of the offer. Wham bang, and here is this player sitting in front of me!  Score one for freebies!

      Well, just like that, it's been a month. It's been pretty hectic these past four weeks, what with all the projects that I'm handling. There's the ev (entrepreneurial venture) project, the osd (organisational structures and design) projects, er (employment relation) projects and the dpp (developing professional practice) project.  I don't know how I'm going to arrange my time around all these. There is just so much research to complete. And the due dates a looming in the not so distant horizon. I guess I'll just have to take it one step at a time.
