      Well, It's been a lil while since i have written and i've got alot to write. My feelings are soo mixed up right now. I don't know how to feel really, i mean i know how i should feel. But i just dunno...i think Josh is trash and i deserve a hell of alot better then him, but at the same time i still remember good things and those feelings are still there. I mean they arent just gunna go away with the snap of a fingere. I cant even write about it.. i just i dont even know what to say.

      I'm gettin pretty damn tired of caring so much about josh..i just wish i didnt care at all. It would be soo much easier when he disapoints me. I mean i care about him sooooo  fucking much. I wanna spend my time here with him and just have fun with him while i can, but i dont know either he doesnt get that and he thinks i still will get attached and that i will get hurt no matter what i say..or he just doesnt wanna spend time with me or doesnt care if im here for a limited time. And if thats the case he should just let me know soo i dont waste my time on it i could be doing other things while im here like NOT FUCKING CARE!  It's frusterating to me, because if i just knew exactly and TRUTHFULLY how he felt i could either keep going on caring and wanting to spend time with him adn trying to spend time with him WHILE im here, OR me do my best and not care and not even try to see him or anything. Ya know but i cant read Fucking minds ya know.. i need to know this kinda shit. I wanna SCREAAM i cant take it.  Trying to figure it out makes me just annoyed and frusterated and makes me say FUCK IT and just stop everything. But that mean there is a HUGE chance i wont see him again. and that kills me and i cant take that. I wish soo much i didnt care. I wish i was the kind of person that didnt care about people...the kind of person that didnt give a shit about what other people think, or how they feel. The kind of person that doesnt get attached. I would love that. But thats not me i care about people, i care a little to much.  I dont see how two people could spend time together and seem so happy together and act all in love like.  And Be sweet to each other and just act a certain way and be soo real about it..and only one of the two poeple mean it and truly feel it. It's weird it's just like you never know if somthing is true or not. You never know if somthing is real or not. So i guess its kinda like you have to live your life either never knowing and always guessing, or just asuming that its not. You cant get your hopes up and you cant believe every little thing someone does is becasue they care or they are even being sincere. You gotta take care of yourself, you gotta look out for your self. If there is chance you get hurt, then Fuck it, its only gunna bring pain u dont need it.Fuck IT.. From now on this is what i live by....or at least try.

      Well he finally text me back and he says...i just dont wanna hurt you anymore than you've already been hurt in your life. I said you cant hurt me and how would you hurt me?  He says i dont know, im just looking out for you. Thank you but you dont have to, i mean i care about you alot i just wanna spend time with you while im here and have fun not think about anything.  I really appreciate him worrying about hurtting me no other guy have ever dont that. I love him for that. That makes everything i feel for him that much stronger. I mean i care about him more than i have ever cared about a guy and knowing that he really does care and that he's looking out for me just makes me i dont know. Makes me want him even more.  If i could have one wish...just one it would be a tie between putting my parents back together my family, or to have him for the rest of my life. Its a tought one. I mean i should say put my family back together forever, but i dont know the thought of having him forever...for the rest of my life it the ultimate happiness to me. Never will i be sad, never will i hurt or long.  All day long after talking to sarah this morning, i was just in a funk. Depressed all day becasue i thought he was going to stop talking to me and just blow me completely off and that kills me to think of that ever happening. AGAIN! i wanna be with him entirely and completely. I would change my whole life for him. Thats sad because he wouldnt for me. And he doesnt feel the same exact way as i do..thats okay i cant expect him to. I know he cares about me though alot. But im just more there i guess i dont know its different.  Im soo gratefull for him, im so gratfull for everything he does to me..everything he makes me feel. Gratefull for him careing so much.

      Well last night i was at Josh's house and things were very different. Jeremy, sarah, and i went to the store, got food, and alcohol and we come home and josh was just chillin on his computer. But not just for a little while the WHOLE time, then after the computer he gets up and decides he wants to go for a drive. I didnt know what the hell was going on. I mean im only here for a little while and i just thought he would maybe wanna spend what little time i have here with me. But i guess i was wrong. I got REALLY REALLY REALLY drunk. And when he went on his drive i just started crying and crying and i couldnt stop. I just didnt understand why he was just acting like he didnt even want me there. I felt pretty damn shitty. And i dont know if when he come back i talked to him or if i bugged him or somthing i just dont know. I felt so unwelcomed.  So Jeremy and sarah are talking today and he tells sarah that him and josh were talking and josh was saying that he was worried about this whole situation cuz he thinks im getting attached and he doesnt wanna hurt me and blah blah blah. I understand why he would worrie about that but he doesnt have to treat me that way. I text him and said...Im not getting attached and ur not gunna hurt me so please dont think that. And well he hasnt said a damn thing back. And seriously i think its fucked up i mean im glad he cares if he hurts me and stuff but talk to me about it dont just ignore me and think that will solve it. THATS whats gunna hurt me. I know NOTHING is going to happen. I KNOW we could never be together HEllO we live across the country from each other im not fucking stupid. I just wanna spend my time Now with him, have fun and hang out. Live in the moment. I dont think he knows i feel that way, but how would he if he doesnt talk to me about it and fucking find out.  Just blowing me off and ignoring me and shit is what hurts me. I wouldnt get hurt later when i left, why would he hurt me..i would be happy to know we spend happy times together. I would be happy at the memories and shit. NOT HURT! i seriously i just cant believe after the week we just spent and know i still have 2 weeks left he would just blow me off. I thought he was better then that. I mean i care about him a whole hell of alot, and i woould LOVE just LOVE to be with him, but i know that will never happen. SO i just want to spend my time here with him. Ya know???? UGH i just thought alot of things were different. And now i am hurt.

      I'm here in FL visiting my sister, its the second time i've been here and let's just say i never wanna leave. If i had it my way i would never leave...and wouldnt care! I wouldnt miss a damn thing about Washington, except my mother! I mean there are things that i would maybe miss and do care about, but they are things that will most likely change anyways, everything does. The one thing that will always remain is my mom so why should i try hard to hold on when sooner or later will be gone no matter how hard i try.       Last time i was here was last summer. I was here for a month and well in that month i met josh. Josh is....well i dont know exactly yet, but hes wonderful. He makes me feel so open, so willing, so volnurable, but not in a bad way. When i very first met him he was just a cute guy, but after i hung out with him a couple times i swore to myself i would marry him...CRAZY i know im only 16, but it was how i felt(feel)and it was pretty scary. I just thought to myself what is wrong with you, you just met this guy you cant really have these sorts of feeling for him its rediculos. And i just kept telling myself its alright its probly nothing your just getting carried away again.. your thinking to much.. its just a lil crush like the rest.     Well, i lost my virginity to him. And well i always wanted to be in love when i first have sex and have it be sooo perfect and the perfect guy,setting everyhing, every girls fantasy. Well it wasnt PERFECT it wasnt a FANTASY. But at the same time it was. It was the right guy, right timing, it just felt right. I don't regret a thing.  Im glad i waited, and didnt take all those other opportunities i had, cuz i would have regreted it. I was soo scared and soo nervous and usually being nervous stops me from doing things, but for some reason it didnt this time. I just gave in to it and im glad i did.       I spent alot of time with him over my month stay and the more and more time i spent the more and more the emotions and feeling just overtook me. I would come home from his house and tell my sister..."sarah, hes it..im telling you i will marry this man. no doubt about it i will marry him!" In this short period of time i was with him i thought i knew that he was the one. I felt so silly for feeling this way, but i let myself. Instead of telling myself no jess your leaving, its only going to bring pain in the end, stop while your ahead, i just let myself fall. Harder and Harder with every moment i spent with him. It was like all the memorie i would have and the feelings i felt while with him was worth any pain i would feel later on. And i didnt care. After coming home at night and being all happy and giddy, i would lie on the couch with the tv on and cry because i knew i had to leave, i knew there was that chance of me never seeing him again after i left. And the thought of that made me so sick and sad. I even cried to him about. Feeling so unbelievably stupid about it i still did.      I just prayed that maybe he'll fall in love with me and just HAVE to be with me and something great will happen...maybe he'll move to washington for me...maybe i can move here....maybe this maybe that. Getting completely carried away. I felt DUMB!

      Okay.............Josh is definetly T-R-A-S-H!!! I don't regret anything or wish anything different. I'm glad what happend, happend it opened my eyes and made me see what he really is and what he's really like. I do think he can  be a caring person and that some things were genuine and honestly from the heart, but a large part was just not real. And i see that now and im glad i finally see that. I just think to myself if he is really that kinda person, the kinda person that will intentionally hurt you, he's most definetly not worth it. No one deserves that, i wouldnt wish that upon anyone no matter how heartless or cruel they are. Well maybe i should tell you the story and you might understand what im saying a lil more.  Well..............What happend was shit happend and was said between me jer and him and things and words just got a lil twisted and miss understood and crap. So then josh was a lil mad at me i guess, so me,sar,jer, and him were all suppose to go to a movie and i was gunna buy his ticket kinda as a im sorry thing and that was his idea and shit..and he was gunna forgive me. But then last minute were waiting for him to show his gay ass up and he says im not gunna go I'm goin to Bob's house. OKAY! so i text him and say "thats to bad" he replys with "Maybe 4 u im fine with it". ASSHOLE...there is no need to be fucking mean. I didnt say shit back and was just like fine if thats how your gunna be whatever. So KNOWING im there at his house he comes home at like 3 in the morning....WITH A FUCKING GIRL!!!!!!! I couldnt believe it. OMG i cant believe he just did that. They went straight to his room.  i was just in shock like wow what a jerk i cant believe he would do that. Just a few minutes later I CAN HEAR THEM HAVING SEX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WOW!!!!!!! I just started crying i couldnt believe what i was hearing and the fact i have to sit here and listen to the guy im like in love with, the guy i lost my virginity to, the guy i was just with a few days ago having sex with some chick!!!! screw that. I deserve soooo much better then that....thats TRASH hes TRASH shes TRASH theyr TRASH!!! FUCK THAT! Nobody deserve anything like that. i wouldnt wish that upon anyone. Not even him and thats sad. I just cant believe he intentionally did that he knew i was there. SCrew him! This chick he is talking to the one he flaunted in front of me twice now is MARRIED w/ KIDS and is his BOSS! Real clean josh real clean... That is T-R-A-S-H!! absolutly trash! He disgusts me. But my heart still remember the good things and moment we spent together and i will never forget them or regret them. Every second with him i cherish...every experience i had with him i cherish, i even cherish the fact that he intentionally hurt me cuz i learned alot. BUT HES TRASH!! hehe

      Daniel Bedingfield Unofficial   Lyrics   - "If You're Not The One" If you’re not the one then why does my soul feel glad today? If you’re not the one then why does my hand fit yours this way? If you are not mine then why does your heart return my call If you are not mine would I have the strength to stand at all  I never know what the future brings  But I know you are here with me now We’ll make it through  And I hope you are the one I share my life with  I don’t want to run away but I can’t take it, I don’t understand If I’m not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am? Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?  If I don’t need you then why am I crying on my bed? If I don’t need you then why does your name resound in my head? If you’re not for me then why does this distance maim my life? If you’re not for me then why do I dream of you as my wife?  I don’t know why you’re so far away  But I know that this much is true We’ll make it through  And I hope you are the one I share my life with And I wish that you could be the one I die with And I pray in you’re the one I build my home with I hope I love you all my life  I don’t want to run away but I can’t take it, I don’t understand If I’m not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?  ‘Cause I miss you, body and soul so strong that it takes my breath away And I breathe you into my heart and pray for the strength to stand today ‘Cause I love you, whether it’s wrong or right And though I can’t be with you tonight And know my heart is by your side  I don’t want to run away but I can’t take it, I don’t understand If I’m not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am Is there any way that I could stay in your arms

      This song is much more than just a song to me. I feel something inside me when i hear this song, or read this song. It touches me in so many different ways. Word for Word...i feel this song.-jess  I'm so tired of being here  Surpressed by all of my childish fears And if you have to leave  I wish that you would just leave  Because your presence still lingeres here  And it wont leave me alone  These wounds wont seem to heal   This pain is just to real There's just to much that time cannot erase  When you cried I wiped away all of your tears  When you's scream i'd fight away all of your fears And I've held your hand through all of these years  But you still have all of me  You use to captivate me   By your resonating light But now I'm bound by this life you left behind  Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams Your voice it chased away all of the sanity in me   These wounds wont seem to heal  This pain is just to real There's just to much that time cannot erase  When you cried I wiped away all of your tears  When you'd scream i'd fight away all of your fears And i've held your hand through all of these years  But you still have all of me  I've tried so hard to tell myself that   your gone And though your still with me  I've been alone all along

      It seemed so real... vividly i remember moments when kisses were from the depth of your unstable heart Those clear blue eyes penetrated thoroughly into my soul While your semingly honest words spoke of nothing but sweet love and genuine tenderness Yet this was but a dream... For: Your kisses were from an unknown source made only in the moment  And your transparent blue eyes  decieved and permeated into my pour oblivious soul But those clever words were false  and untrue So now i'm left wil dreams... turned to wishes.

      Broken  I wanted you to know I love the way you laugh I wanna hold you high and steal your pain away I keep your photograph; I know it serves me well I wanna hold you high and steal your pain  ‘Cause I’m broken when I’m open And I don’t feel like I am strong enough ‘Cause I’m broken when I’m lonesome And I don’t feel light when you’re gone away  The worst is over now and we can breathe again I wanna hold you high, you steal my pain away There’s so much left to learn, and no one left to fight I wanna hold you high and steal your pain  ‘Cause I’m broken when I’m open  And I don’t feel like I am strong enough ‘Cause I’m broken when I’m lonesome And I don’t feel right when you’re gone away  ‘Cause I’m broken when I’m open And I don’t feel like I am strong enough ‘Cause I’m broken when I’m lonesome And I don’t feel light when you’re gone away
