      								     Who hasn't had enough of the "newsertainment" industry?  What ever happened to responsible and ethical news reporting?  Who are the instructors and professors who are teaching our nation's young men and women to "report" the news in the manner that we read and hear on a daily basis?  Are these instructors and professors not the "Michael Moores" of journalism who do not consider their methods and stories to be the bane but the best of the business?    How many university professors make C. John Sommerville's "How The News Makes Us Dumb" required reading?  How many university instructors would make "Bias" written by Bernard Goldberg, required reading?  Isn't Fox News considered "conservative" by some because their own views, being tilted far to the left and embracing a pronounced anti-Christian, anti-American worldview, hinder their ability to perceive level ground or an objective worldview?    Well, O.K.,  let's be honest . . . there is no such thing as "objective" news reporting or an objective worldview.  But let's continue to be honest and instead of denying our biases or attempting to ensconce them in some rhetorical hubris, let's declare what they are and why they are what they are.  The Big Swirl is about the general worldview that shapes and informs the thoughts, beliefs and opinions of the media elite, the intellectual elite and the culturally isolated.  The culturally isolated are those people (particularly the media and intellectual elite) who, while living out similar worldviews, believe that everyone embraces the same general worldview, while denying that they may be eggregiously out of step with the majority of Americans.  They are too often unaware of the fact that they are culturally isolated from the rest of this nation because their world of friends, acquaintances, collegues and co-workers consists almost entirely of those who embrace their general worldview.  Their use (or misuse) of words and language betrays their bias, such as when they label  others who are not in agreement with their worldview as "fringe thinkers," "odd-balls" and "extremists."  Often the term "conservative" and "right wing" is (subconsciously) employed in their attempt to make those who view things differently seem like they are the ones who are out of touch with the majority of people.  This misuse of these terms more accurately reflects their own unwillingness to see themselves as the minority who is "left of center."  Why should they escape the scrutiny and well deserved rebuke of the majority of Americans who do not agree with their incoherent ideas?  Indeed, they are the real fringe thinkers, odd-balls, and extremists.  How about this for an obvious example:  Scott Peterson, the double-homicide suspect in the Laci and Connor Peterson murders, is being prosecuted for the murder of his wife and unborn son.  Yet on a daily basis, the murders of hundreds of unborn babies are permitted and defended by "pro-choice" advocates as well as the laws and some of the law-makers of this nation.  (Most alarming in this group of "law-makers" are the activist judges who are constitutionally out of step with the separation of powers, and who illegally and arrogantly impose their unpopular views on the citizens of this nation.)  Why do we have such an inconsistent view of life and why isn't this incoherent application of values being questioned and reported in the news?      An inconsistent and incoherent view of the world is a tragic thing, but it is the general view of too many Americans  (particularly the few who have almost unlimited access to the most effective means of forcing it down our throats) and it dominates our society today and continues, for the most part, without being made to answer for its follies.  The less consistent and coherent our view of the world is, the more fragmented and isolated our lives will become until the only view of the world that will be left is one that demands, requires, exhonerates and excuses absolute despotism and tyranny in the desperate and hopeless attempt to control the confusion and quell the anarchy that inevitably results from such misguided views of how reality works.  Freedom and liberty require the exercise of our intellect, and our intellect and reason must be informed by truth, not fairytales or fiction.  Somehow this view has been lost, but The Big Swirl intends to contrast the siren song of the intellectual and media elite with the inextinguishible view of universal truth.  Stand by for more news and commentary on The Big Swirl.  Gregg

      Almost everyone has heard or read Hans Christian Andersen's story of the emperor's new clothes.  No one really saw the "new clothes" as the emperor paraded through the streets, but for fear of being called stupid, everyone pretended to see them.  This is a fairytale for children, or is it?  A most accurate parallel in the fields of science and education makes this children's story a fairytale for grown-ups also.  What is significant however is that in the story a child spoke the truth, but the emperor was unwilling to admit what he knew to be the truth.  Several years ago, an atheistic scientist discovered something that scientifically disproved an evolutionary origin of the earth.  Following the evidence and the facts this scientist abandoned his inadequate beliefs and re-adjusted his position.  He was convinced that the earth had come into existence, as the evidence reveals, in an instant.  That scientist is Robert V. Gentry and his discovery of polonium "halos" is, to this day, uncontested as scientific evidence of creation.    Why wasn't this discovery announced by the media elite in all the major newspapers and networks?  It's a lot like walking around naked for years under the misconception that you really are wearing the finest clothes that money can buy.  You just do not want to admit error and change your position.  The nakedness of the intellectual elite and culturally isolated is embarrassing, but what is more bewildering is their degree of comfort wearing the "finest material" of evolution which is really a fairytale for grown-ups.  This was, and still is, really big news.  It's like discovering that the earth revolves around the sun rather than everything else in the universe revolving around a stationary earth.  It's upsetting to say the least, especially if you hang your intellectual hat on such a tenuous foundation and build and entire worldview upon it.    Like the two scoundrels in Andersen's fairytale, there are too many scoundrels in the fields of science and education who simply will not agree with the child's simple observation:  "He's naked."  Evolution is a fairytale for grown-ups.  There is a day coming when the theory of evolution will collapse in upon itself in the public realm because we cannot live in fairytale land.
