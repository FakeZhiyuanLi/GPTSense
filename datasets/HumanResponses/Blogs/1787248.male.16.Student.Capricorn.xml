       backstory:    in two weeks, we were supposed to be going to ohio and moving my sister back home because she's coming back for 3 years of college.... so she can become a teacher.&nbsp; or something, i don't know the whole story.    current story:    so yesterday at like 10am my sister called my mom and demanded that we come this weekend instead, so my mom gets all the plans set and we leave around 2.&nbsp; After a very long, boring trip (with me sleeping on the floor of the van) we eventually made it to Ohio.    the trip there:    so I was sitting there tired of the dog scratching to sit on my lap, so I went into the back (we took out the seats) and sat on the floor.&nbsp; I pulled out Joe's Patented Duct Tape-Box-o-Rama and played a quick game of Premiere Smackdown WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO-Perstar vs. Team Anal.&nbsp; After&nbsp;a quick beating, I decided to build a new deck out of the cards I had in JPDTBOR and the 2 binders I had with me.&nbsp; I built Underedge.&nbsp; So the deck sucks, but it was something to do on the ride down.&nbsp; Flair 2nd or 3rd turned it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I slept for quite a bit of the way, too.&nbsp; My grandma was driving the lead vehicle (there were 2 vanss, my dad and myself in one and my mom and grandma in the other).&nbsp; We were following her, and she doesn't speed.&nbsp; At all.&nbsp;&nbsp; She needs to learn how to speed so the 7 hour trip is only 5 hours next time, like normal.    arrival in fairfield, oh:    so we arrive around 9CST 10EST and we go to her apartment.&nbsp; they're all down and shit cuz she's leaving, so we kinda just talk for a little bit, they go to a hotel and we chill in their apartment.&nbsp; me=couch, grandma=futon, mom&dad=their bed.&nbsp; aqua teen wasn't on.&nbsp; no aqua teen = no happyness.&nbsp; bitches.    the morning after:    we pack up the vans, and get ready to depart.&nbsp; after a sobby-30-minute goodbye we get on the road, and go eat at Frisch's Big Boy.&nbsp; I don't know why they call it that, when the food isn't that "big".&nbsp; We get on the freeway, and make our first stop in Shelbyville, IN a.k.a. Hell!!!    Shelbyville:    Shelbyville has never been good to us Wisconsinites.&nbsp; One of the first times my sister ever went to Ohio, her car broke down in Hell.&nbsp; The people here are bastard asses and should all be killed.&nbsp; This time, it's where all tha " drama " happens.   &nbsp;   tha drama:   So, my sister pulled in front of my grandma, and we pulled into a gas station called Big Foot.&nbsp; She's like "i have to go to the bathroom".&nbsp; She goes to the bathroom.&nbsp; I take the dog to go piss in the grass.&nbsp; Sara decides she feels bad leaving her job.&nbsp; Roight.&nbsp; Her job.&nbsp; *wink wink*&nbsp; So she grabs her clothes and heads back after a nice half hour "Make the right decision" talk.&nbsp; *sigh*&nbsp; Here comes uncomfort.   uncomfort:   What's so uncomfortable about this?&nbsp; There's only 2 seats open in the van, and one is the drivers.&nbsp; the dog  was  supposed to be w/ my sister, but she's not coming back.&nbsp; and she's not keeping our dog.&nbsp; so the dog has to ride with us.&nbsp; we clear off a spot on the futon in the back and I get a nice long 7 hour car ride SQUISHED INTO A GOD DAMNED MOTHER FUCKING BALL.&nbsp; Un-fucking-comfort.   the ride back:   did I mention I   HATE   Indiana?&nbsp; The people there suck, it's damned boring, and it stole Gencon.&nbsp; Let's not rant about that.&nbsp;&nbsp; I slept quite a bit on the way back.&nbsp; It was uncomfortable.&nbsp; I better not continue or I'll keep bitching more and more.   now:   in two weeks my sister is driving up here.&nbsp; yay.   post.over

Yeah, this guy was trying to cheat me in an AIM game, what a jack ass. And he changed his mind as to who he wanted to be once he realized I was of greater superstar value. Overall, if you're reading this, don't play AIM games, because they're gay and people cheat. Download apprentice, it's so much better and you can tell if you're opponent's cheating or not. Hell, I didn't even know if this Shivatra X jack ass had a Game deck built. No wonder his head exploded when I asked him what he overturned for Not Done with Any Flair...Clown shoes, man, clown shoes.

      Congrats Joe on winning your second Raw Intercontinental Title, our Flair PWNZ >>> EVERYONE.&nbsp;I haven't won&nbsp;an IC&nbsp;yet, but then again, I haven't played in a tourney for one either.  Anyways, Team Fear the Mullet might be in full force at Gen Con, considering I am told there is a miniscule chance I could still be going. I'd have to pre&nbsp;register my Gen Con badge (waiting in line is a pain in the ass)&nbsp;get to the bus station after the first day of school, get on a Greyhound heading for Indianapolis, have Joe pick me up at the bus station in Indy, then head to the convention center equipped with my mullet and my Raw Deal decks. I'm not so sure if the plan is perfect, there would be muchos expenses, but as far as I'm concerned, there is nothing like Gen Con, it is the most amazing gaming convention EVA.   See you guys later, I gotta go work on some Wisconsin Style decks for the Diva's Overload era just in case I get to go.  Later Days, bitches.

       [a little prelude story:&nbsp; today on AIM, Josh and I were discussing efeds and how we used to both be able to type up an awesome promo, and I decided that I would try and see if I still have what it takes.&nbsp; If I do or not, you can decide, but some of this is pure truth and some of this is pure fiction.&nbsp; Which is which is for you to decide]      &nbsp;   ::The lights dim red and goodbye forever rings throughout the arena as the shadowy figures of Joe Warner and Josh Cohorst appear at the top of the stage.&nbsp; They both make their way down to the ring.&nbsp; joe and josh are both wearing Team Fear the Mullet T-shirts.&nbsp; They pose for the crowd to snap pictures, and joe grabs a microphone.::      JOE : Lately, there's been a lot of talk going on in the Raw Deal world about what team is the best, who is the strongest, and all kinds of bullcrap.&nbsp; You know what I've mainly heard?&nbsp; A lot of random pointless bullshit that really doesn't mean anything.&nbsp; These jabronis from teams like Dark Tower and   Team Evolution have been ranting about how all of the best teams come from the northeast, but Team Fear the Mullet is here to change that.&nbsp; In the Raw Deal world, it may be suprising, but there are good players outside of New York, New Jersey, and Arizona.&nbsp; Barron Vangor Toth may not want you to know this, but it is true.&nbsp; There are several other states out there with some of the top unheardof players in the country.     &nbsp;   ::The crowd starts booing and chanting "DARK TOWER! DARK TOWER! DARK TOWER!" but the local hecklers are just feeding Team Fear the Mullet's anger::     &nbsp;   JOE : THIS IS  EXACTLY  WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT!&nbsp; YOU ARE ALL FED THIS INCORRECT  "TRUTH"  THAT THERE IS NOTHING BETTER OUT THERE, BUT THERE IS A TON BETTER OUT THERE!&nbsp; Team Fear the Mullet is here for the Teams that are not getting the recognition they deserve!&nbsp; Team Fear the Mullet is here to take home some wins for the good guys.&nbsp;    &nbsp;   ::The crowd once again loudly lets Team Fear the Mullet hear its opinion, which is "You suck!&nbsp; You suck!"&nbsp; However, Joe and Josh just smile as the crowd belittles them::     &nbsp;   JOE : Keep chanting, keep chanting.&nbsp; Remember your chants as we become the most dominant team in all of Raw Deal!&nbsp; Remember your chants when we win the world championship!&nbsp; Remember your chants, because they fuel our hunger.&nbsp; They fuel our hunger for domination.&nbsp; As I sit there and win at Gencon, I will remember your chanting and I will laugh because I know I will prove you all wrong.&nbsp; I will win the big one.&nbsp; And Josh here, just wait until November.    &nbsp;   ::Joe throws down the microphone and Team Fear the Mullet stands in the ring taunting the fans as they get pelted with garbage.&nbsp;&nbsp; Josh picks up some of the garbage and starts throwing it back, and eventually the members of Team FTM leave the arena as the cameras fade to black::     &nbsp;  So, how did I do?&nbsp; It's probably not as good as it could possibly be, and it IS for a heel team, and I'm not a big fan of heels in efeds.&nbsp; It IS 1:20am, so that could have an effect on it, too...

      So what if the tournament is actually on Friday and I accidentally put Saturday?&nbsp; Either way, it's in the next 2 days.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone is demanding that we have sealed/draft at Game Castle on Friday, so I'm allowing them to use their powers of democracy and they're having a goddamn draft.   I don't know how fun starter-divas-divas draft will be, though.&nbsp;   So tomorrow/later today I'm gonna head to Kenosha and beat up JDub and the Team Biznitch crew and win me a Raw IC belt, because I Am That Damned Good.&nbsp; I am thinking about using Back&nbsp;To Basics Mankind.&nbsp; That deck is mad fun.&nbsp; I love drawing 2 a turn when you've only got 40 cards in your deck.&nbsp; It really sucks, though, when they're an aggro deck (especially SCSA) and you don't draw a reversal.&nbsp; Today, I played against Mr. Cold, and he did Austin Kick->Austin Elbow->Atomic Lariat->Atomic Lariat on his first turn.&nbsp; That sucked.   I played some games with Wisconsin Style Ric Flair.&nbsp; Wisconsin Style?&nbsp; Yeah, cuz it's cheese.&nbsp; Get it?&nbsp; Wisconsin... cheese... damn I hate that.&nbsp; [minirantmode1]Why does everyone (including myself) always relate Wisconsin to effing CHEESE, BEER, and HARLEYS?&nbsp; Ok, I guess there's not really much else, but it gets effing annoying.&nbsp; I love cheese, but I hate beer  AND  Harleys.&nbsp; Harleys are loud, noisy, pollutiong hazards to the environment.&nbsp;&nbsp; During the Harley 100th Anniversary, seeing all those disgusting dirty biker fucks didn't help either.[/minirantmode1]     JOE ON HAVE A NICE DAY      Super Rad Joe : that it's H.A.N.D.   Super Rad Joe : and it discards their HAND   Super Rad Joe : hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha     END OF JOE ON HAVE A NICE DAY      &nbsp;   I'm smart, I'm witty    You're stupid and smell like shitty    Jewbag     &nbsp;   Sorry felt like being a poet for a second.&nbsp; That's about&nbsp;frodieN neL.&nbsp; Bong.     &nbsp;    HEHEHE THIS COLOR IS SHITTY.&nbsp; GET IT?&nbsp; IT'S SHITTY! HARDYHARHAR!      &nbsp;    Someone needs to shut down the internet because it's not good while you're sitting online while you're bored.&nbsp; Hell, look at this blog entry.&nbsp; If you're actually reading this, please reply.&nbsp; I'd honestly like to know that someone cares.&nbsp; Thanks for reading, until next time (next time probably = in about 15 minutes)      &nbsp;    Joe, the Sexy Beast

      Yes, Joe, hopefully this day will not be "boring ass". It probably will be for me though, considering I don't get to go to my gaming place and play Raw Deal all day.   Anyway, here's another excerpt of a convo from Joe and I:  Super Rad Joe: i statred watching a movie at like 2am  Super Rad Joe: Van Wilder Super Rad Joe: that movie is effing great  JustADr34m3r: meh...  JustADr34m3r: The jizz sub sandwiches...  JustADr34m3r: Ew...Super Rad Joe: lol it's eclaires man  JustADr34m3r: I haven't seen it in a couple years, so, blame it on that  Super Rad Joe: I watch it like once a month  Super Rad Joe: and my sister has it on dvd  Super Rad Joe: but I watch it on like Showtime Super Rad Joe: we get all those channels  Super Rad Joe: all 14 hbos  Super Rad Joe: 14 showtimes  Super Rad Joe: 7 cinemaxes  Super Rad Joe: 7 tmcs  JustADr34m3r: So you get lots of porn pretty much?  Super Rad Joe: that's not porn  Super Rad Joe: that is not even close to porn  JustADr34m3r: Late night isn't there porn on?  Super Rad Joe: the "adult" movies they show are like kiddy porn  JustADr34m3r: So you just stick to the internet?  Super Rad Joe: I really try not to look at porn :-P  JustADr34m3r: Yeah, me too  JustADr34m3r: It screws up your computer  Super Rad Joe: I used to all the time tho  Super Rad Joe: on Yahoo Groups  Super Rad Joe: cuz it's impossible to get a virus from looking on yahoo groups ;-)  JustADr34m3r: Heh Heh  JustADr34m3r: There are Yahoo porn groups?  JustADr34m3r: WTF?  Super Rad Joe: lol there used to be  JustADr34m3r: We should blog this conversation in the ramblings of Team Fear the Mullet

      so we say goodbye and go underground or up towards the sky up in smoke but down in size     at least we're still friends, at least we're still alive     goodbye forever - alkaline trio    that song is amazing, and if you haven't heard it you must.&nbsp; I wish I could have seen their whole set yesterday, but that's what happens when you believe the advertisements.&nbsp; From now on I shall be 15 minutes early for anything and everything.&nbsp; Or an hour, if meeting Taking Back Sunday.   So I am bored.&nbsp; Boredom is the story of the summer.&nbsp; Today was quite possibly the most boring day ever.&nbsp; Days after concerts when you're not really tired = really a downer.&nbsp; I was so up and happy yesterday, now all of a sudden I'm just sitting around the house, and I feel like going out and doing things.&nbsp; I couldn't even go to Game Castle today.&nbsp; Effing Wednesdays.&nbsp; I hate Wednesdays.&nbsp; Everyone always talks about how they hate Mondays, but Wednesdays are my least favorite day.&nbsp; Mondays and Tuesdays are the "recovery from the weekend and talk about your weekend days" and thursday and friday are the "It's almost the weekend" days.&nbsp; Wednesday is just that one day that drags out where there's really nothing to do except wait for the days where "it's almost the weekend".&nbsp;   Ranting over, I'd just like to say that I hate the Divas Overload era of Raw Deal.&nbsp; I miss the days when I could still play action cards.&nbsp; I miss the days when I could still play maneuver cards.&nbsp; Hell, I miss the days when I could still  play  Raw Deal.&nbsp; Being a manager sucks, but someone's gotta do it.&nbsp; I guess it's better than jobbing because I'm not prepared for some random off the wall deck, though.

      Yeah, Joe, I completely know what you mean. This day has been boring and I've pretty much been doing the same thing you have.  Woke up at eleven, got online, talked to people, took a shower, went to lunch, came home, played Joe in Raw Deal, and now I'm back where I started: Talking to people.   Yesterday wasn't much better either,&nbsp;I was in my mom's van all day because we were driving back from Indiana after my Great Grandma's funeral.   Using a line from Jay in VH1's I Love the 90's.

      You may read the topic and say "Damnit, now he's gonna whine about how he has no friends and how he can't get laid, I wish he'd just go kill himself" but it's really not about that.  One thing I've learned (especially in Raw Deal) is that life is not fair.   THIS FONT IS FUCKING HUGE AND IT MARKS THE BEGINNING OF THE RANT ZONE!  IF YOU DON'T WANT TO READ MY ENDLESS RANTING, THEN SKIP TO THE END OF THE RANT ZONE   So I got banned from TCO... again.  I have no problem with being banned, but the REAL problem I have is with AntiGoth and HalfBadger.  The main reason they are admins is because they're Rob Dean's best friends.  Understandable, but sometimes you just can't give your friends what they want and you have to pick mods/admins that do the job correctly.  AntiGoth and HalfBadger both said if links were sent in, they'd   reprimand (ha fucking vocab fucks)   the flamer/post whore/whoever.  Sooooo HalfBadger was on AIM the other day and I instant messaged him.  I don't have the exact IM anymore, but this is how it went:  J: Hey, I found some grade a flaming on TCO HB: Show me J: Link HB has signed off (signifying a ban)  Right.  They care.  MY ASS.  I could send them 5000 links, but they'd just say "Whatever, it's not you flaming/post whoring/breaking the rules, therefore we don't care".  Let me inform you all of why I have to say I was banned from TCO   again   and why I'm just not "banned from TCO"  Back in the day, there was a user by the name of Gareth.  After a little Joe/Gareth/Untouchables Flame war, it wound up that I (and only I) was banned for a month.  Amazing, isn't it?     I   was the only one banned.   Fast forward a little bit, Dictator/Gareth hack TCO, I get banned again, but this time Kevin Bunker says "I had a desire to hack TCO with the dictator"...  what the shit?  I hated dictator, why would I want to hack TCO?  Fast forward a very long time, to when the Raw Deal CCGPro patch comes out.  Me and David Klein set up forums and everything and stuff is going fine and dandy.  One of the admins from TCO, Jarrod "AmericanNightmare" Westerfield registered at our forums.  After a brief period of time, Doyvid found out that you could access people's passwords, and he eventually went on Jarrod's TCO account, deleted all of the forums, and then started accusing me.  Trust me, Doyvid, I know you were accusing me.  I was in the chat room you were doing it in.  Luckily I had a friend online when it started happening (I wasn't online at the time, I was off sleeping or something)  Anyways, he tells me what's going on, I hide out for a few days, and after the smoke cleared I took the blame.  What the hell, I was already being blamed anyways, and I was already banned so why would I care?  Fast forward a lot more to this Summer.  Dealers is about to go on air, and I have a little chat with RVD in a chat room for Dealers.  We talk and RVD unbans me.  Yay.  So I start posting on TCO again.  For those of you who don't visit TCO: That place is a hellhole now.  Right after all of the spoilers came out, everyone started trying to make "Potentially Broken" (yet even more potentially shitty) combos.  Then there's the dumbasses who can't put together a simple sentance let alone spell some of the simplest words (career?  carrier?  what the fuck?)  Besides that, there's the people who don't RTFCs.  If you don't read the fucking cards, don't talk about them!  End of that section of rant.  Even Team SRB sucks nowadays.  SRB used to be the coolest, now it sucks because they let all these stupid dipshits in.  I have been thinking about it while writing this, and I decided I will say it.  Ezzy ruined SRB.  That's all I have to say on that topic.  Then, there's the TCO politics.  If you ask Nick Chehi why he left, he'll tell you it's because of this.  At least that's what he told me.  Rob Dean isn't willing to scold any of his mods/admins when they break the rules.  Don't even get me started on their moderation/administration staff.  So, back to why I started ranting, life is not fair.  TCO is not fair.  The Forums are not fair.  In the end , Team Fear the Mullet will just be discriminated against.  There's no end to it.  The only end is a bullet.  Just kidding.  I hit my 3 strikes.  Hell, I'm SURE the Untouchables reached their three strikes SEVERAL times.  Let's start a Tally:  BJ of the Untouchables ----------- "I don't claim to be a member of 14 different teams in my sig and I don't act like a bitch when someone else is having fun. I believe that being a part of a RD team means something and I don't go throwing it around like "I'M IN TAEM POOPIE PNATS" eff you, idiot. I and my teammates are just requesting something that isn't likely to happen IN HOPES THAT IT WILL - stop trying to rain on my parade you rim jobbin' fecal slut." - Direct flame towards me (SuperRad) on the post....  urlLink http://www.teamcanadaonline.ca/tcoforum/thread-view.asp?threadid=18103&start=26&amp;posts=34   FalconX2 ---------- "Hellz Yes Hard Times!" - Post whoring on  urlLink http://www.teamcanadaonline.ca/tcoforum/thread-view.asp?threadid=18682&amp;posts=13   THEY'RE EACH AT ONE STRIKE!  OH LORDY  I don't feel like ranting on, so  THIS IS THE END OF THE RANT ZONE, AND YOU CAN TELL BECAUSE IT IS SYMBOLIZED BY THIS HUGE FUCKING TEXT (  motherfuckers  )   So I built a Cheap Pops/Plunge/Mono-Grapple Dude Love.  It's sexy.

       urlLink    What Thursday Song Are You?    brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla   .  So yeah.  Life is a bore.  You're mothers a whore, cuz she always wants more.  I should become a rapper, take the world over while it's sittin' on the crapper.  Word.  You're scurred.  Soooooo JP wants me to go to the store today and pick up some Ultima Online CDs.... and then I'm supposed to play Ultima Online.  I think I'll go but not stay for long.  Hey, it's a free game...  So Team Fear the Mullet is getting it's own segment on Dealers, which you can check out EVERY FRIDAY at some time.... I think it's like 7:30 central time I don't remember.   urlLink http://www.macharbor.com/dealers .  On our first segment, we will be covering strategy for a long forgotten superstar of the past, Road Dogg.   I've been working on some t3ch for Gencon... since... it's like 18 days away.  SHIT! Gencon's 18 days away!  YAYYYYYY    My Sealab and Aqua Teen collections are almost complete, with like 5 more episodes left for each.  I'm addicted to NFL2k5.. and everyone should buy it.  But for Xbox, not PS2.  And if you don't have an Xbox, trade your PS2 in towards one.   It's almost that time of year again where I'm only available after 3PM on weekdays.  I'm kind of looking forward to it.  But I'm looking forward to the events that will be happening before it (Finch, Gencon) a lot more.  School = good stories = good times.  Word.  Speaking of Finch, Disturbed = a bunch of fucking pussies.  I hope Dave's head is still hurtin'  Thinking about Finch makes me think about concerts.  TAKING BACK SUNDAY SEPTEMBER 30TH MILWAUKEE WISCONSIN THATS RIGHT BITCHES WE'RE THE 3RD DATE ON THE TOUR!!!  YEAH SUCK IT DRY!  I rule you.
