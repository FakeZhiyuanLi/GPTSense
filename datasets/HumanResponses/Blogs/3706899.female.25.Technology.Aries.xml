      Yay! I just bought a swift and a ball winder from eBay, for winding those pesky hanks of yarn into usable center pull balls. Sweet....

      After I posted all that, I finished the Kittyville hat (well, except for the pompoms on the strings).  It's made out of cheap-ass Red Heart acrylic yarn, and I think I made the hat part a bit long:

      Yes, finally, the promised pictures.  I was a big dork and didn't feel like modeling stuff myself, so I hired my trusty teddy bear, who didn't complain one bit.    The completed Booga Bag from the knit-along.  Noro Kureyon #124.    A full view of the scarf you've only seen detail of previously.    One of my Maineiac hats for next season.  Lion Brand Wool-Ease Thick and Quick Denim Print.  Cast on, knit in the round, decrease, and end.  Easiest.  Hat.  Ever.    Same pattern as above, but pastels.  Plymouth Yarn Yukon Print.    Another Kitschy Kerchief.  I couldn't get this to look right on the bear, so I (reluctantly) modeled it.  I was too lazy to tie it though.  Lion Brand Polarspun.  I am never using this stuff again.    Flash is bad, mmmkay?  If I had more AA batteries, I'd retake the picture, but it'll have to wait.  This is Knitaly 100% wool in red speckled and black.  The Windy City keyhole scarf from SnB.

      Well, loyal reader.  What I need you to do is simply this. If I ever mention making another Coney Island Fireworks Scarf again, I need you to go to Joann's and buy a pair of size 35 needles.  Then beat me with them until I change my mind.  I am about ready to strangle myself with the eyelash yarn. That is, if it wasn't tangled into a knot that precludes the aforementioned strangulation. *cries*  However, I did make another chunky roll-brimmed hat tonight, the Homespun sweater is going quite well, and I'm slowly working myself up to conquering the Beast Known As Double Pointed Needles. (It's getting to be about that time when I wear sandals, but my toes are still cold, so it's time to look geeky in handmade cool socks.)  I still have ears to make on the Kittyville hat and ends to weave in on a few things. (Why-oh-why do I hate the end-weaving?) In fact, I should go weave the ends now and start in on a picture-post. Yeah.

      Fireworks scarf: still annoying me. Not only is it boring, but now the eyelash yarn is irreparably tangled, despite keeping the ball in a baggie.  Kittyville hat: needs ears, pom-poms, and end-weaving (why is it that weaving in the ends is the part of the project I hate the most?)  Booga bag: DONE! It's hanging from my coat rack as we speak.  Kool-Aid yarn: tried some last night. I have a aqua/lavender hank that didn't turn out as well as I'd hoped, and a red/pink/purple one that looks pretty cool. Next time I'm going orange/yellow/red. Maybe tonight as a matter of fact!  Tonight I'll probably start the homespun sweater or the cat bed and weave ends into other projects while I watch more hockey. And try to figure out a good way to store my double-point and circular needles. Then, a photo post should be forthcoming.

      So here's my progress log for right now.  Almost done: Windy City Scarf (weave in ends) Blue/white Kitschy Kerchief (sew ties on, weave in ends) Booga bag (finish felting, block/dry, attach straps)  On the needles: Coney Island Fireworks Scarf (which I'm ignoring b/c I'm bored with garter stitch) Official Kittyville Hat (in some really scary cheap-ass Red Heart yarn...looks fairly cool, but needs some mega-softening--this one should end up being finished tonight)  Next up: Homespun hooded sweater Princess Snowball Cat Bed (from SnB) And maybe, if I feel really daring...socks. I'm scared of double point needles, but I want to learn to make socks, b/c, I mean, look at all the really cool self-striping sock yarn out there.

       urlLink     What color of sock yarn do you prefer?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Blue is good.    You are a masterful knitter!  I don't know how you got this result, but what the hell...  Enjoy your title, and try selling some of your "unvented" patterns- you may make enough for that bundle of qiviut you've been drooling over...    urlLink   Are you a knitter?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    OMG, not a chance...I just started knitting just before spring break.  Though I used to make all these swatches of lacy patterns in dishcloth cotton I found in my mom's cedar chest when I was a kid.  So I know how to do all that stuff...I just never actually MADE anything before spring break.    You are interchangeable. Fun, free, and into everything, you've got every eventuality covered and every opportunity just has to be taken. Every fiber is wonderful, and every day is a new beginning. You are good at so many things, it's amazing, but you can easily lose your place and forget to show up. They have row counters for people like you!    urlLink   What kind of knitting needles are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Well, I have been wanting to try those...but I have too many sets of regular needles to justify the cost.

      So I'm almost done with the Booga Bag...all I have to do is felt it and string the handles through, and it's done. I might get impatient and do it in the washers downstairs, even though it'll use valuable quarters. Today I started the Coney Island Fireworks Scarf from SnB and got crazy bored after about 4 inches. I mean, it's just garter stitch. (The only reason I decided to start it was I organized my stash, and the Trendsetter Metal yarn ball was unraveling, so I figured I'd better knit it up so I don't have to store it anymore.) Now I'm whipping together another Kitschy Kerchief with Lion Brand Polarspun. The last time I tried, I used needles that were too small and ended up breaking the yarn numerous times, so now I'm using bigger needles and hoping it works out. It feels nice.

      20 more rows to go on the Booga Bag. Haven't worked on it at all today...work, then hockey game. Though I might pick it up during the UMass-UNH game, as I'm not as excited about that...whoever wins, it'll be a good opponent for Maine tomorrow.  Got my yarn for Kool-Aid dyeing in the mail today. I'll have to wind the hanks later if I need something mindless to do.  What should I start for a project after I'm done with the bag?

      The Booga bag knitalong began today. Good timing, as I needed a new project. I was going to start the Kittyville hat from SnB, but this works instead. While Kelly was over, I got 6 rows of the bottom done (could have gotten more done if I wasn't putzing online), and (yes, I realize it's 1am) I'm hoping to get a good portion of the bottom done before I go to bed so I can pick up the stitches tomorrow. As I knit more with the Kureyon, I'm liking it more and more. I like the subtle gradations of the colorway, so different from the typical few inches it takes for most to completely change color. Must get more Kureyon.  I think I should also have something mindless and easy on the needles at the same time, so I think I might cast on my other Splash scarf or the Coney Island scarf (again, from SnB...god, I love that book!) Garter stitch, knit until the yarn runs out. What could be easier?  I'm still on the lookout for a sweater pattern for myself that I'm really liking. I want to get through a sweater for myself before I start Kelly's. (I have plenty of time, I promised it for her for Christmas.) I just don't want a gift sweater to be the first one I ever make...I want to muddle through one that doesn't really matter first. Make sense?  BTW, started and finished the roll-brim hat last night. I feel like I knit wrong with circs...is the nylon wire supposed to face you, or the gap between the needles? I suppose it really doesn't matter, since everyone knits differently. The hat turned out well. Very quick knit (well, for me). Next up: weave the ends of the Windy City scarf and sew up the mouse I made. (Knit a quick and dirty mouse out of some leftover wool last night. I'm going to knit more for the Boy's mom's cats.)  Busy busy busy. The more I knit, the more I enjoy it.

      I found a  urlLink website  for a group that makes hats for cancer patients.  I think I might put my needles to work for that....my academic advisor has cancer, so the idea kinda hits home for me.

      I'm nearly finished with the Windy City scarf from Stitch N Bitch...38 rows to go.  I should be able to finish it this evening.  Next up is my first foray into circular knitting...a simple roll-brim hat in Lion Brand Wool-Ease Thick and Quick Denim Twist.  It's a strand of slate blue and a strand of navy twisted together.  I'm going to be knitting a lot of blue accessories between now and the beginning of next hockey season.  That way I'll be the girl in the spirit section wearing a different handknit hat or scarf each home game.  Yes, I'm a nerd.    I'm also participating in a Booga bag knitalong starting...soon?  I'm using this yarn for the bag:   It's Noro Kureyon #124.  Yummy.  Also, stay tuned for Kool-Aid dying, socks, catnip mice, and a whole bunch of other stuff in the near future!

      This scarf is the first thing I have EVER finished.  (I've known how to knit since forever, but really started doing it seriously recently during a bout with depression.)  It's in the process of being blocked, here's detail of it pinned out.  It's chestnut heather Lion Brand Wool-Ease worsted, the pattern is the faggot lace scarf from Knitting for Dummies.     This hat, modeled by yours truly, is made of the same yarn as the previous scarf.  The pattern is "Most Basic Hat" from Hip to Knit.     This basic garter stitch scarf is of Crystal Palace Yarns Splash.  I fell in love with the color scheme and like the way it knit up.  It took me only an afternoon of off-and-on work.  I plan to make at least 10 more *grin*.     And this is the Kitschy Kerchief from Stitch N Bitch, made out of some completely random sport weight yarn with a German name that I can't remember.  (It's a tweed of a dark rose, dark grey, and either black or navy blue, I can't tell, it seems to change in the light.)  I'm going to make a solid colored one in seed stitch at some point.

      A nice, big blocking table/board/SOMETHING.  I'm blocking a scarf on my ironing board right now, which sucks for two reasons:    The pins aren't staying too well, since the foam is a total of maybe 1/16" thick.     The board isn't nearly long enough for the scarf, so I have one end of it doubled over.  It's a mostly acrylic blend, so it should dry fairly quickly anyway.      So a blocking table would be wonderful.  I might have to put my head together with the Boy and design one to build up in his dad's shop one weekend.

      I just want to state for the record how very, very much I hate sewing. It takes away time I could be using to knit. But....I finished two things that only needed to be sewn up. UFO night continues...pictures later.

      I've made a LOT of progress on Shapely since last post. Tonight I got to the bust shaping and have done one set (out of 12!) of the short rows. I've done a lot of stockinette stitch today, and have come to the conclusion that I hate purling. Maybe it's all those garter stitch scarves I've done and all the practice I've had at the knit stitch, but my purl rows take twice as long as my knit rows. Maybe next scarf I do I'll purl every row for the practice. It'll look the same.  I think tomorrow's official UFO will be the beaded scarf. I've screwed up so much (already!) in the second row, and mohair's so hard to "tink", that I think I need to just start over. I'm not looking forward to casting on 237 stitches again, but every scarf I've seen posted in the knit-along site looks so good that I'm inspired to get cracking on mine. Not tonight though. My eyes are too bleary. But before that I'm seaming up everything that needs seaming and weaving all the ends that need weaving! (I need to start weaving ends as I go. Argh.)

         Note Ayla attempting to help.  I've just started the waist shaping on the front.  The front will take a little longer than the back, alas, because of the short-rowing at the bust.  I have to admit I'm still not entirely sure how short rows work...I did exactly what the pattern said to, with the wrapped stitches and everything, down at the hem, and I *still* have little holes.  I have to get this figured out by the time I make Kelly's sweater (Pinup Girl from SnB), because it *features* short rows.  I'm not giving my best friend a sweater full of holes unless it's supposed to be full of holes, goddammit.  If you're actually looking at this page (rather than reading from your friends list), you may notice that I have two projects 95% done.  Basically that's code for "I have to sew the dang things together, but at least I'm done knitting them."  If I'm lucky, my evening will be spent with a needle sewing.  (Not that I need the wrist warmers, since it's getting pretty warm, but it would be nice to finish the kitty bed for Ayla so she can stop nosing at the current knitting.)

      Got some patterns from Patternworks and Elann today. I absolutely love how they send the patterns already in sheet protectors. That rocks so hard. The only problem with sheet protectors is they make the pages stick out far enough in the binder that the tabs on my dividers don't show. I might have to take a trip to Staples and see if I can get some wider dividers. I'm soooo excited about making the Charlotte's Web shawl. (Yeah, I'm catching on to it about a year after every other knitting blogger.) I'm thinking if I can get it done by Russ's Christmas party, I'll wear that over a simple black tank dress. Mmm. I also got a couple patterns from White Lies Designs and a few Berroco books. I enjoy those books because most, if not all the patterns, go up to a size that I can wear (and usually a couple sizes bigger...rock!)  Stash organized. Every single ball of yarn I own is in *something*. And holy shit, there's a lot of it. As soon as I get the Koigu I want for Charlotte, the yarn diet begins.  I'm going to spend the rest of the day swatching for the Shapely Tank with some cotton yarn I got from Elann a while back in a green/blue/white colorway. Spring's finally coming here in Maine, I have to be ready!

      So I did what I said I was going to do. I seamed the beige hat (and even though it's a bit too big, it's still pretty cute), I finished knitting the kitty bed, and I worked on the beaded scarf. Holy crap, that fine yarn is driving me absolutely crazy. This is going to be a slow project.  Today I *really* need to organize my stash. It's just all thrown together in bins, no rhyme or reason.

      And one of my UFOs, of course, is blogging about my FOs.            These are all Kool-Aid dyed Patons Classic Wool Merino.  (The colors look much more vibrant in person, my digital camera is a POS.)  The bigger balls are ~200 yards each (one full ball), and the smaller ones are ~100 yards each (half a ball each).    This is a simple mesh hat I made out of about 2/3 a ball of Cascade Fixation (cotton/lycra blend).    This is the infamous Coney Island Fireworks Scarf.  It's made of navy blue Brown Sheep Cotton Fleece and blue/copper Trendsetter Yarns Metal.  Never again.  Never friggin' again.    And another scarf made out of beautiful, beautiful Crystal Palace Splash.  This one will be going to hockey games with me next year.    Tonight's UFO is my kitty bed.  I got through quite a bit of it last night, and I have about 5 more inches before I can sew it together.  I'm hoping to finish the knitting tonight, as I think I'm going to need help sewing it together.  After that, I'm hoping to work on the beaded scarf for the   knitalong, or starting a Shapely Tank with some random stash yarn.  And I've decided against frogging the beige hat, so I'll seam that up tonight, if only to free up the needles.

      Well, I think I'm going to frog the beige hat. It's going to be too big, and I don't think I'll wear it anyway. So, now I need something else to do with one skein of wheat heather Wool-Ease.  Did another couple inches on the side wall of the kitty bed last night while I couldn't sleep. About halfway through. It's slow going because, truthfully, it's kinda boring. It's just straight garter stitch. So I just need to get it DONE.  My nerdy-ass self put together an AppleWorks database last night for my yarn stash, just so I can keep track of what I have. It kept me calm too. I'll continue working on it tonight, because I need something to keep me calm again.  Later, there will be pictures. I have one more hank of Kool-Aid yarn to wind into a ball, and then I'll take pictures of that and all the FO's since the last photo-post. Promise! (Besides, I finally replaced the batteries in my camera.)

      Well, I said on my main journal that I was taking a hiatus from blogging because of some things that are going on in my life. But I think I'm still going to keep up my knitting journal, because, with all this stuff going on, knitting seems to be the only thing that's keeping me sane right now. So I'll still be posting here.  I still owe some pics of the two blue scarves I've made, a couple of hats, and some Kool-Aid yarn. I've rolled 3 out of 4 batches into balls, and they look pretty cool. I'll have to swatch them and see how they turn out.  On the needles: Still working on the kitty bed and the Homespun sweater. Finishing up a beige hat. Still casting on for the beaded scarf (230 stitches of really fine yarn really tests my patience.) Going to start a Bottoms Up Bucket Hat (http://www.chicknits.com) in Cotton Fleece. I ordered banana and putty, which one should I make first?  In the process of converting my needle collection to bamboo. I'll have to sell the metal/plastic ones on eBay.

      This time it's a beaded mohair scarf. Mine's out of "marmalade" (uh, orange :-) ) Rowan Kidsilk Haze. Mmm, soft. I'm having so much fun stringing the beads onto the yarn *eyeroll*  Last night I finished a bucket hat out of Noro Iro, and now I just have to block it. I should have distributed the decreases better on the brim rather than pair them up next to each other. The brim has an odd point on it now. Other than that, I haven't finished anything since last entry. Le sigh. I've been so depressed I haven't even felt like knitting.

      In one of the knitting communities I'm in (I can't remember which one and I'm too lazy to open my friends page and check), tonight (and possibly every Thursday night) has been proclaimed UFO night (UnFinished Object night), meaning finish something that's unfinished tonight. I suppose I finished something, but it doesn't really count since I started it today. It's a cabled/seed-stitch hat out of some of the rest of that Wool-Ease T&Q denim twist yarn. The pattern's out of Hip to Knit, and the damn thing is wayyyyy too long. Kinda big too. But I can fold up the ribbed edge to help with the length and it's all good. I wasn't sure how it would turn out with the twist yarn and the stitch pattern, but it's not bad. Either way, it'll keep my head warm at hockey games next year. (Note: seed stitch in a bulky yarn is my new favorite thing. So cushy feeling....)  I'm working on a PDA cover out of the same cotton/spandex yarn I made the lace hat out of, but I think I may frog it. The stitches are really uneven....I think my tension's off, because my stockinette is usually fairly nice looking. I still need a cover though...I think I may make it out of some Kool-Aid yarn I have though. Or the random Plymouth Floral Splash I couldn't resist picking up on sale at the LYS. Or one of my half-used skeins I have kicking around. Or....okay, I'll stop.  Now, should I go to bed or work on Tiff's scarf? That might bore me to sleep at this time of night, since it's just knit knit knit knit. Argh. I need to step up to more challenging stuff, and soon.

      I went through my yarn stash last night, wrote down an inventory of all the yarn I have, and realized that I'm definitely making Christmas presents for people just to use a bunch of it up. Holy crap! I should go through it and figure out who would like what.  I made a lacy hat out of Cascade Yarns Fixation. I really enjoy working with this stuff. It's mostly cotton, with a bit of stretch to it, and you'd think with the extra stretch it would be hard to work with, but it's really not. You just have to make sure to keep your tension even. The colorway I used is a pale pastel rainbow, and it's nice. Very springy. It was an easy lace pattern too (yarn over, knit 2 together, repeat), so I got bored near the end. I want to make one in a more complicated lace, but I'll have to figure out the decrease pattern to blend in with the lace, as well as modify any lace pattern I find to work in the round, since most of them are written for flat knitting. BTW, I still hate double pointed needles, but they aren't as bad to finish something on as they are to start something on.  Kitty bed is going well. I'm probably a third of the way through the side of it, then comes the sewing. I should work on my sweater some more, I'll need it for the lab in the summer, since everyone here loves their AC.

      I think I'm going to end up going to the LYS when I get home and begging for help, because I can't even get through the first round without wanting to stab myself in the eye with one of those tiny double pointed needles. Good thing I brought other projects down here with me :-)  Started and finished another Splash scarf, this one in blues. I made this one a bit narrower than the first one, so it's quite a bit longer. Now Tiffany wants one, so I'll be picking up yarn for that tomorrow. And the kitty bed is progressing quite nicely. I don't see how any cat could NOT want to cuddle up against this stuff, it's so fuzzy-fun-comfy. Now I want to make one for every cat I know. Wonder if the shelter would appreciate donations.

      I'm taking two potential projects with me to Portland. One is the Princess Snowball Kitty Bed from SnB (black and sandstone, in case anyone's wondering), and the other is socks. I'm going to come to terms with the whole double pointed needle thing, I think. (Not bringing the Homespun sweater, it's getting a little heavy to be portable.)

      DONE!!!  Damn thing's 6 1/2 feet long. I didn't even use up both skeins of eyelash like it says to in the instructions in SnB (had to throw away some tangled bits), and the scarf was only SUPPOSED to come out to 4 feet. Hrm. Pictures will have to wait, b/c it's almost 12:30 and I should really be in bed and asleep by now.  Yarn shopping in Portland in a couple days, woohoo!

      Yep, Thursday again.  So tonight I'm going to: --finish the armhole edgings on Shapely --work on Eros --decide what's going with me on the trip --and maybe start Charlotte  Ambitious considering it's already 8, but since I slept all day (sick, not lazy), I think I have a chance. I started picking up stitches for one armhole before eating chicken soup, so I've got a start.

      Alright, I am SO going down to Cityside (the LYS) tomorrow and picking up a Chibi needle. I'm weaving in interminable ends on Shapely right now so I can maybe start knitting the edging sometime tonight, and an angled tip would really help. If only there were some spell I could cast and *poof* all the ends would be invisible! I think every knitter dreams of such a spell, really.

      Yay! Shapely now has both a complete front and a complete back! Now she needs complete seams. That's a project for tomorrow or Thursday or something.  Broke down and bought the pattern for Rogue. Those cables are so beautiful...and scary.  Balled all the yarn for Charlotte. (Koigu is gorgeous.) I'll start her this weekend.  I think I'm going to put the beaded scarf on hold until cooler weather. I just can't get motivated to work on it.  Hmm, what's next?

      Took a couple FO pics tonight.    Grr.  Apparently my camera's flash has issues with the color red.  Anyway...this is my first crochet project ever.  It's from one of those scarf kits they have at Craft World.  It's made of Lion Brand Jiffy Thick & Quick in a red-based rainbow color, whatever they feel like calling it.  You can see that my tension loosened way up as I kept going.  The beginning of the scarf is way stiff, not scarf-like at all.  (I was wrapping my yarn the wrong way as well.)    This is a knit string shopping bag from Plymouth Fantasy Naturale (100% mercerized cotton).  The way it's hanging, it almost looks like a cute little cami.  There's a pocket at the bottom that it tucks away into, but I still need to sew a button on.  (Have I ever mentioned that I hate sewing?)    No, I'm not hiding on purpose.  The hat really is that big.  Next time I'll make the next size down.  The yarn is Bernat Handicrafter Cotton (NEVER AGAIN!).  Mom, this is the hat I want to make for Kimmy's son.  I might have to size down the pattern though, I'll know after I see the kid and measure his head.  I don't know how big infants' heads are.  There might be more pics later, I'm seeing the end of Shapely's back.  (Then, the sewing.  *cry*)

      HOLY SHIT!!! I just turned a heel, and it was SO COOL how it worked!  Okay, the knitting geek is going back to the knitting now :-)

      And I feel  urlLink perfectly justified  in spending tonight knitting.  I think my project will be turning the heel on Practice Broadripple and getting through (at least partially) the waist increases on the back of Shapely.  And yes, I know that part of my UFO night ritual involves posting pictures of recent FOs.  See, I can't do that tonight.  It's not that there aren't FOs.  It's that there's no camera.  I accidentally left it in the Boy's car on Sunday after taking it to my mom's place to take pics of some porcelain she wants appraised, and then the Boy went back to where he lives and won't be back until tomorrow.  So there will be pictures of a finished Huge Bucket Hat and a string shopping bag made of cotton, as well as possibly Tiff's scarf if I can get her to model it.  Off to knit!  Update later.

      Why my sock is bad: --I can't stand the color. It's just some random stash yarn that came with a grab bag I ordered. --I can't get even tension for the life of me. It makes the sock look all pebbly. --I cast on too tight, so the top edge pulls in. --I can't see how this damn thing is going to fit around my pudgy ankle. --This would look so much better in a variegated yarn, since the ripple stitch would be more obvious, but I chose a solid. --I haven't gotten to the heel yet. That's gonna be the hard part. --I can't think of a good way to store needle #5 when I'm not working on the sock. Somehow sticking it in the middle of the solidly wound ball of yarn isn't satisfying me.  Why my sock is good: --No ladders! --The pattern is incredibly easy to remember. The stitch repeat is conveniently the number of stitches on one needle. --Working with DPNs is easier than I originally thought. --I think my tension might be starting to even out. --It's going quickly. With probably a total of an hour of work, I've got over 2 inches done.  Right now, the goods are good enough to outweigh the bads, despite having less of them.

      Alright.  That crap I was spewing about trying to clean off my WIP list before the trip?  Well, I just joined a sock knitalong.   urlLink Broadripple  from knitty.com, to be exact about the sock.  I'm going to do this sock thing, dammit!  Of course, that means starting another project....

      I don't understand my fascination with making socks. I'm scared to death of double pointed needles, because every time I finish a hat with them I feel so awkward. I don't screw anything up, but I feel like I will any minute. And once the snow melts, I don't even wear socks unless I absolutely have to. My toes are freed at the first opportunity. So why my obsession with learning to make socks? I have all this sock yarn that I haven't even touched, because I'm apprehensive about trying.  Yes, I know it's only pulling loops of yarn through other loops of yarn, and it's not dangerous like open heart surgery or anything. But in my warped little mind, socks are the thing you have to be able to make to be able to say, "Yes. I am a knitter." Sweaters? Bah. I'm making one right now. It's just a hell of a lot of easy knitting. You increase and decrease when you're making hats, and I've made a ton of those. Lace? No big deal. Yarn overs are easy. Color work? Not really interested yet. Socks. OMG. You have to use those tiny double pointed needles, you have to use tiny little yarn, you have to *gasp* turn a heel and use short rows...damn. I will not be a knitter until I've made a sock. Well, preferably a pair of socks. Until then, I am just a random person who knits a lot. There is a subtle difference.  And I finally figured out what the deal was with my tension on my crochet scarf. I was leafing through my "Learn to Crochet Fast and Save the World" (okay, that's not really the title) book and found that I was putting my yarn over the hook in the wrong direction. So I made an effort to do it right and lo and behold, my stitches are looser and the scarf feels like a scarf and not a piece of particleboard! Rawk. (I'm still amazed by the size of this hook...it's 15 millimeters! I don't have knitting needles that big!)

      This thing feels absolutely phenomenal, and despite the slowness of knitting, it's knitting so smoothly and looks great.  So once it's done, where the hell am I going to wear it? I don't think these things through well at all.

      -- Finish the waist decreases on the back of Shapely (on row 7 now since starting the decreases, the last decreases are on row 17) -- Do a couple inches on the abandoned beaded scarf -- Wind a few hanks of Fantasy Naturale into balls -- Possibly work on Eros, but that's not a definite  It may seem late to add all this to my tonight list, but I slept in today, so I'll be up for a good 2-3 hours more tonight.  I've decided I'm not starting anything else until I've taken 2 things off the in-progress list (and no, Tiffany's scarf doesn't count since all I have left on that is weaving in two measly ends). Ideally, I'll clear the list and won't start anything else before the trip so I can start fresh. (I'm counting the Monday night I spend at my grandparents' before we leave as part of the trip...I'm such a cheater.)

      Kelly's scarf Shapely (if it's not done) Bistro top Simple and Sleeveless (from Purl Stitch) A couple random hats (bucket/stretchy mesh/etc.) Charlotte Kureyon felted ballerina slippers Socks (?)  This may seem like a long list, but when it comes to knitting projects I'm very ADD. And I never know what I'm going to feel like working on, so even when I head to campus I pack two or three different projects. So this list may change between now and the 24th. Especially if I manage to scam some yarn from my mom tomorrow ;-)

      Well, guess who did absolutely nothing on UFO night!  That's right, I went out last night and by the time I got home, I didn't feel like knitting. Today I'm not letting myself knit until I get some good cleaning done, and I've made reasonable progress so far, but it's still gonna take a while.  Yesterday afternoon I started the back of Shapely, and the other day I bought yarn for the Bistro Top. Fantasy Naturale, like the other yarn I wanted to use, but in a medium pastel rainbow colorway. I'd link to the colorcard, but the variegateds aren't on it, just the solids. Bah! Bah, I say! Maybe I'll start that soon, or save it for a car project for the trip. With me, who knows? I'm also thinking of furthering my crochet knowledge and trying this pattern for a cloche hat I found. It didn't come with a picture, so I have no idea what it'll end up looking like, but it's worth a try, right? I bought a bunch of cheap-ass cotton at Wallyworld the other night, so if it doesn't work, I'm only out a couple bucks.

      Which, since this is a knitting blog, is extremely relative.  The good news is, I have a completed front of a Shapely Tank! Wooo! After I bound off the straps, I held it up to myself and decided I needed a few more rows b/c the armholes seemed to end too high...so I got to rip out two bind-offs. That was fun *eyeroll* I completely screwed one up, but once the edging is knit on you won't be able to tell. I just discovered a Tank-Along...if I can't join with my already-in-progress tank, I'll just have to make another (maybe not the Shapely though...I'll be ready to try something new.)  The bad news is, I don't have enough of the Fantasy Naturale for the Bistro Shirt. In fact, I'm short by 50 yards. Gah. And I know for sure that the store where I bought it is sold out of that color, much less the dye lot.  I'm finally teaching myself how to crochet...well, let's be completely honest. It's finally clicking. Yesterday I bought one of those Lion Brand scarf kits that comes with the hook/needles and big bulky yarn. I didn't think crochet hooks came that big! Anyway, it's a simple single crochet scarf, which I'm assuming is the crochet equivalent of a garter stitch scarf, out of Jiffy T&Q. Fuzzy. A little fuzzier than I like, but whatever. Anyway, the scarf itself seems sort of stiff, super thick too, thicker than it would end up if the yarn were knit...is that odd, or is my tension way tight? (I know a couple people who read this crochet, so I'm hoping they can help!)

      I ordered my yarn for Charlotte from Threadbear today. Rob sent me a picture of my colorway and I just keep opening it and looking at it and drooling....and drooling some more. Kelly said it looks like candy. I just want the yarn to come so I can start making it. I got a couple of skeins of Koigu from an eBay auction the other day--it feels sooooo nice.  Stocked up on cotton yesterday for hats and headscarves and things. I think before my trip I'm going to make a teeny Bottoms Up Bucket Hat for Son of Cousin (son's name eludes me at the time....Taylor I think?) I've got a blue ombre that would be super cute. I just have to finish up the one that's on the needles at the time, as soon as the replenishment yarn comes from Central Yarn this week sometime.  Found a pattern in my collection for a cap sleeve collared thingie that I think would be gorgeous in the Plymouth Fantasy Naturale I have in my stash...provided I have enough. Otherwise....oh darn, trip to the yarn store. The cap sleeves actually make me happy, for once, because I've already sunburned my shoulders once this spring, and maybe a bit of covering can help the sunblock.

        This hat came from VKOTG's Caps and Hats.  I made it with Wool-Ease, which is actually awesome yarn considering it's mostly acrylic.  I took out one pattern repeat and every time I measured the gauge it was right AND I made a size smaller than my head, but it was still too big.  It's not meant to be folded up like it is in the picture.    This was just me not checking gauge and using yarn that's probably a bit heavier than called for.  It's the Gathered Hat from Hip To Knit, and if you look really carefully you might be able to see the cable sort of on the right (your left) side of my head.  Probably not, because it blends in fairly well since I used tweed yarn.  Another member of the Wool-Ease family here, this is the Thick & Quick.  Forgive the flirtatious look.  I always give the camera weird looks when I'm taking pics of myself.    Got this pattern from a knitblogger, Will Knit For Food (I'm too lazy to find the URL right now, I'll edit and add it in later).  Made from one (almost) skein of Noro Iro.  Still needs blocking...the brim won't roll after it's blocked, it'll sort of hang down.      Wrist warmer.  There are two, but the other one looks exactly the same, so I figured you'd get the effect from seeing just one.  From the same crappy Red Heart yarn as the Kittyville hat.  Just a K1P1 rib rectangle seamed up the side with a hole left for my thumb.    Since Tiffany wanted to see my progress on this...The colors are totally inaccurate.  For some reason my flash decided not to work, and I was standing between the chair and the overhead light.  You can see the waist shaping on the right side (because I pinned it out so you could!) and the poofiness up at the top is caused half by being smushed onto the needle and half by the short rowing.    Goodness!  Where does the bed end and the kitty begin?  She's been in it almost constantly since I finished it Thursday, so I think it's safe to say that she likes it :-)  It's the Princess Snowball bed from SnB, sandstone Fun Fur for the side and black for the bottom (which you can't see, b/c there's an Ayla in the way).

      Something else I need to do if I'm going to knit stuff for Christmas presents is find another bin, put all the yarn I'm reserving for Christmas knitting into it (so (1) I don't use it for other stuff and (2) I know what else I need to buy) along with a list of what's being used for whom, AND keep the Christmas FOs in that bin as well.  (How's that for a badly-structured sentence?  You'd never believe I have a degree in English, would you?)  Just a thought I was having while I was starting someone's Christmas present just now.  (I'm making my advisor a mistake-rib scarf in raspberry alpaca.  Mmm, soft.  I have maybe half an inch done now *grin*)  Edit:  The alpaca just told me it doesn't really feel like being mistake rib.  (It tried it for 3/4 of an inch, and they just weren't getting along.  I've got the lean-y back and forth thing going on the columns of single knits.  I totally need to take the master knitters course.)  Maybe feather and fan instead.  Where's my stitch dictionary?

      The more and more I think about it, the more I want to try the TKGA master knitters program.  To the point where, once I get my next paycheck, I'm ordering level 1.  I know there's a knit-along already, but if anyone wants to sort of buddy up and do it with me, comment or leave a note on the tagboard.  (*ahemJessieahem*)  I finished the Deco-Ribbon bag today, well, except for the sewing-y stuff (the lining and the handles).  I might hire my mom to do that for me, because, well, if you've read anything I've ever written EVER, you know my dislike for sewing.  Of course, I was in a weird mood today and put it on my head, and it's the perfect size for a crazy, almost kitty-ear-looking hat.  If I pull the corners in and tack them on the inside, it would be really cute.  Decisions, decisions.  I guess I'll call it done and decide what to do with it later.  I'm realizing that if I want to knit Christmas presents, I'd better get going on it, since next semester will be a lot more busy than the summer (duh!).  I've got one done, but big deal, it was probably the simplest and fastest one on my list.  Yes, I realize every new knitter says "Oooh, I can knit everyone I've ever met something for Christmas."  I also realize every new knitter says "Oooh, yes, I know every new knitter fails miserably at knitting lots and lots of presents, but  I'll  be the one to succeed."  My solution for that is, knit the most important ones or the most complicated first, and if I don't get to the last ones, no big deal.  I also finally figured out what to do with Michael's afghan.  Doubled Homespun (I know, I know, but I have a couple cones in colors he likes, and that's an easy way to get it GONE!), big needles (that I need to buy this weekend), and seed stitch.  Easy enough, quick enough, and he's already impressed enough that some random older cousin will knit him something.  Okay, now that I only have two projects on the needles, and one will most likely be done by Friday, it's time to start something else.  Any ideas?

      I've done very little knitting since Friday's Stitch N Bitch.  There, I finished Broadripple Sock Numero Uno.  (I didn't cast on for Numero Dos until today...very bad me.)  Other than that, I finally frogged some stuff that I was planning to frog, I knit a hat out of chenille and promptly frogged it when I realized that I had cast on too tight and I hated the pattern anyway, and I looked at Charlotte and thought about how much I should work on her.  Of course, I realize this at around 11 pm most of the time, a time when I'm still awake and will be for quite a while, but at which I'm not nearly functional enough to work on something that's that fiddly and attention-requiring.  Well, I did make a small dolphin.  Started it Friday night, finished knitting it Saturday on the way to Amanda's, finished putting it together in the car sitting in Amanda's driveway, and immediately gave it to her.  She liked it, and laughed a little at the copy of Island of the Blue Dolphins I gave her with it, as the small dolphin was made out of blue-ish gray yarn.  (Hence its title in my sidebar, Island of the Blue Dolphin.)  Didn't get any pictures of it, because my brain in its infinite wisdom allowed me to forget my camera.  Blah.  I've got start-itis right now.  I feel like starting a new project, but I really should finish something up before I do that.  And of course, I haven't the least bit of a clue what I'd like to start.  I finally found a pattern for my cousin's afghan, but I don't have the yarn, and I certainly don't have the huge-ass needles the pattern requires.  Size 35 needles aren't usually on your list of needles to stock up on.  I could start on Kelly's sweater, but I don't really feel like making something I have to swatch for at the moment.  I could make yet another scarf or hat...ugh.  I could make a Chickami, but the thought of endless stockinette....yes, I could use a stitch pattern, but then comes the deciding what pattern to use, blah blah blah.  (Side note, one of these days I'm going to design a tank top in a pattern that scallops at the bottom, sort of like feather-and-fan stitch or something else chevron-y.  When I'm smaller and can pull it off better.)  Okay, enough rambling.  I'm going to go work on the Deco Ribbon bag, since that's reasonably close to done.

      You know, I haven't really finished much lately.  I keep starting things, getting bored, and frogging.  And miraculously, that didn't happen with Shapely, and here she is:     Those colors are totally not accurate.  The old "take picture of self in mirror" doesn't lend well to color accuracy.  The yarn is from Elann.com, Endless Summer Sonata Print, and it was pretty much all stockinette stitch, all the time.  Now prepare for cuteness.  Are you prepared?  Okay, here we go.     You can't really get a good look at the hat, but it's the only picture I have of Taylor actually wearing the dang thing and not whipping it off as my camera went "clicky."  (See how his hand is blurry?  I caught it just in time, because his hand was on its way up to pull it off.)  It's the Bottom's Up pattern from ChicKnits.com, the smallest size, which is still too big for him, and the yarn is Lion Brand Lion Cotton.  It came out nice, but the cotton was hard to work with doubled on the brim.  My hands hurt just thinking about it.

      So I've been tempted off and on to send for the TKGA Master Knitter's certification program.  I know I can knit fairly well, but would something like that make me better or merely frustrate me?  I guess what it comes down to is, non-knitters think I can knit well.  I don't know enough knitters, but I got compliments on my tank top in the yarn store on Friday from people sitting there knitting (and people who work there).  Do I just want validation from people who are good-good-good knitters?  Or would I rather not have them judging me right now?  Would it take the fun away from it, or add more fun as it improves my skill?  Hmm.

      I have gotten so little knitting done lately.  Between the wedding (no, don't get excited, not mine!) over the weekend, and trying to set this thing up last night (and I still have way more customizations to add), I've done nothing except try out mistake rib in cruddy Red Heart yarn  last night  early this morning when I couldn't sleep.  I'd really like to get a few more rows done on Charlotte sometime in the near future.  I'm well into color #3 at this point, so row-count-wise I'm halfway through, more or less, but the rows are going to start getting sooooooo long.  I'll probably work on it tonight, if I can keep the cat from playing with the Koigu.  (Hand-painted yarn is not a kitty toy!)  Now I have to think about Christmas presents.  I've finished one (yay!), which isn't as cool as it sounds...it's just a Splash scarf.  They take, like, 3 hours.  Ooooh.  So much work.  (This one's in purples, for Russ's sister.)  I should really get started on Sarah's HP scarf.  She's going to be back from Russia soon, but then, she lives in Arizona, so it's not like she'll need it in the near future.  Maybe I'll procrastinate on that one some more.  I still need to post some pics.  Maybe that'll happen tonight too.  (I know, Mom, I keep saying this and never doing anything about it.)  If you're reading this, go over there ---> and post something on the tagboard!  It's cool, y'know?

      --I'm going to wear Shapely on Friday to the yarn store field trip/Stitch and Bitch. If anyone will appreciate it, knitters will.  --I think I'm going to frog the Eros scarf. Garter stitch scarves are boring as heck when they're not made in Splash, consequently taking only about 4 hours to complete. I think this shade of Eros wants to be a shawl or something. Though not with only one ball. I could buy another, the yarn store has PLENTY in the color. For now, back into the stash with you, Easter Color Eros.  --Which brings me to the question, what to work on at S&B? Andrea's scarf will be done by then. So will the cloche hat. I'm bored with the socks. Charlotte is way too complicated to talk and knit on at the same time. (Well, maybe not complicated. More involved.) Wow, is that really everything I have going? Maybe I'll do some designing/swatching for Michael's afghan. (I'm having thoughts of reversible cables in thick yarn.) Or swatch for Kelly's sweater. Who knows? Anyone got ideas?

      I'm sewing up the seams on Shapely right now. I did the first one a few nights ago, and nearly stabbed myself in the eye repeatedly to relieve the pain. The second side seam seems (heh) to be going a little better.  I've found a couple girls to set up a Stitch and Bitch group with. I'm excited to find people who also knit. We're doing a yarn store field trip on Friday (during which I'm going to resist making a purchase) and then heading back to campus to knit in the Union. Yay!  EDIT: Shapely, she be done!!! w00t!!! She's a little clingy around the tummy, but fits nicely around the boobs and hips. The straps are a LEETLE wide for my taste, and I made the armholes SLIGHTLY too shallow, and the seams look like ass, mostly because my selvedge stitches suck, and I got bored with all the frickin' stockinette stitch by the end, but it's the first garment I've ever made!!! Pictures will happen at a later date, mostly because right now I'm lazy. I'm so impressed with myself right now!

      Until today.  Because it's so bloody hot.  *fans self with Elann newsletter that came today*  I want to knit, but even in A/C I can't bring myself to.  But otherwise, it's been good.  I've made good progress on the Slyth scarf, I've pretty much doubled my progress on the sweater, I've considered working on Charlotte (of all my projects, it's hardest to work on her with the cat around, because of course she's attracted to the Good Stuff, not the acrylic blends *grin*), and I made a washcloth, and actually wove ends RIGHT when I finished the knitting!  I NEVER do that!  (No pics yet, still have to block the thing.)  BTW, hi, Secret Pal!  *waves*

      I've been carrying Sarah's HP scarf around to work on while riding the bus, but as I was telling Kelly today, it's really getting too big to bring with me.  It's not even halfway done, and I think it's almost 3 feet.  So...what to bring?  I should make something out of the 2 skeins of beige-y Koigu I have kicking around.  Gloves?  BTW, I put two more batches of Kureyon up on my give-my-yarn-a-good-home page.  I think if something goes unclaimed for a week, that's when it goes on eBay.  Projects I've neglected the past few days: the sweater and Charlotte.  My friend Tiffany admired my entrelac swatch today (I hung it on my bulletin board, because I'm a dork like that.)  Of course the non-knitter appreciates the most fiddly, complicated thing I've done!  *grin*

      I hate picking up stitches.  Hate hate hate hate hate.  It's the Knitting Technique of Doom.  So, that leads me to the question....what in the WORLD possessed me to want to try entrelac?  I knew going in that it must involve picking up stitches.  Lots and lots of damn stitches.  But apparently on Mondays I'm a masochist, so I pulled out my Official Trying New Things Yarn (white Red Heart) and went through the instructions in Debbie Bliss's  How To Knit .  (I knew everything else in the book...I checked it out of the library JUST for the entrelac directions.)  Thoughts: --When it says cast on loosely, OMG, they ain't kidding!  I cast on loosely, or so I thought, and the cast-on edge still pulled in compared with the rest of the piece. --It would have been way cooler in the variegated type of Official Trying New Things Yarn, what with the stripes going every which way. --Wouldn't it make more sense to have the slipped stitches on the loose edge where you'll be picking up stitches eventually rather than the edge that's connected to the rest of the piece? --The process became routine after a while.  I stopped counting stitches on the short rows and just watched for a gap in the stitches...that meant I had to do something different. --I still hate picking up stitches.  It's much easier on socks.  Next challenge: Fair Isle.  Other randomness for the day: --Bought yarn for DNA scarf and for socks for Roger.  All yarn to make Christmas presents is now procured. --Found PERFECT patterns for various presents.  That is all I can say. --Barbara Walker's stitch pattern dictionaries are TEH AWESOME!  I ignored them for a while b/c of the lack of pretty color pictures, but when I gave them a chance...wonderfulness.  Couldn't resist grabbing a couple. --Lucy Neatby's handpainted merino is just as beautiful as Koigu.  Bigger hanks too.

      Looks like y'all want me to list what I have here before I throw it on eBay.  I can do that.  I need to write up a small webpage with the list and take a bunch of pictures and stuff, then I'll let you know the address to that...just so I don't have to post a big long entry going on and on.   urlLink Lisa  wanted to know how much I'd want for the Kureyon.  It averages about $8.50/ball in stores and $65-70/bag of 10 on eBay (except for the really popular discontinued colors, which I do have a couple of...I saw a batch of 5 in color #70 go for over $90!), so I think probably $6 a ball from blogreaders.  But look for that in the next week or so.  I have to buy batteries for the digicam.  (BTW, if anyone's interested, I do have some needles and a ball of Schaefer Elaine up right now.  Needles end tomorrow afternoon, Elaine ends Tuesday afternoon.  Username is himeykitty2.)  In actual knitting news, I'm plugging away at the WIPs I have and started a flower washcloth from  Weekend Knitting , just to have something small going.  I did a few rows on Charlotte Friday afternoon.  Those rows are getting long, and after doing the math I'm going to add over 100 more stitches before I'm done.  Over 300 stitches in the last few rows!  That'll be fun to bind off.  I need to get moving on my Christmas list...I have 5 months as of today.  I should start Roy's DNA scarf, as that's probably the most complicated thing to do.  I just have to find sport weight alpaca first.  Have to go to Cityside (soon!) and see if they have the kind I'm looking for.

      Charlotte: 100% merino wool. Kelly's sweater: 80% acrylic/20% wool. Sarah's scarf: 75% acrylic/25% wool. Weather: hot and humid.  Is anyone else seeing anything wrong with this picture?   *digs for cotton*

      Okay, I added a new commenting service.  It's pretty much just like other blogs now, name, e-mail, website, comment.  Now I can actually respond personally to comments that people leave.  Of course, now I can't see any comments that were left on the built-in Blogger commenting system, but whatever.  Comment away!  (Jessie, I did get your comment on the last entry e-mailed to me.  If I don't end up posting my yarn here, I'll e-mail you with what I have for Kureyon.)  Edit: Okay, so the screwed up thing is, even when there are comments through the new system, the link on the page says "0 comments".  I'm gonna try to change that, but until then, don't be misled!  Edit again: Fixed it!  Yay me!  (For those who read this through the LJ feed, I'm sorry, I probably screwed things up good by editing this entry so damn much.  I'm done now, I promise.)

        Yep, that's Sophie.  She still needs felting, but that might be a few days, depending on when I can get to a washing machine that doesn't require quarters.  (Mom? *grin*)  Other than that, I don't really have much else knitting-related to talk about.  I need to start something new, as everything else I'm working on will take a while to finish, and I don't want the whole boredom thing kicking me.  Poll:  Like I said a couple entries ago, I need to destash.  Question is, should I post what I'm getting rid of in my blog first and give my loyal readers first crack, or should I go with the eBay?  Of course, I'm not sure how many people read this thing, but it's worth asking.  Leave a comment with your opinion!  (In case you're wondering, I've got a Metric Butt-Ton of Kureyon, much of it in discontinued colors, some novelty yarns, a batch of Cascade Sierra, and possibly some Iro and some completely unrelated-in-color Wool-Ease.  What I've got might influence decisions here *wink*)

      So I've started going through my yarn collection...Alas, I must sacrifice much of the Kureyon.  I'm only keeping the colors I absolutely love and know I will use.  I'm also going to get rid of some of the random wool (Colinette stuff, a couple skeins of Elaine, etc.) and some cotton blends.  Possibly some acrylic as well, not that I think people will really want it.  A bunch of the Fun Fur too.  So I have to get to the business of taking pictures of all the yarn and actually listing the stuff.  Dunno why, but eBay seems to be a pain to use.  Probably it's super-easy and my addled brain is making it harder than it actually is.  Weird sleep patterns will do that to ya.  The good part is, during the agonizing decision making I've been making some pretty good progress on Sophie.  16 rows left to the body, then the i-cord.  I ought to do some more on the sweater too.  I don't want to start anything new until I'm done with something.  My WIP list is way too long, even for KADD (Knitting ADD) me.

      You know what?  I have a hell of a lot of yarn.  I was cleaning my computer/knitting storage/cat hangout room yesterday and realized this.  When I first started knitting, I became addicted to eBay and pretty pretty pretty Kureyon.  Not to mention the piles of Fun Fur.  I think tonight I'll try to sort through what I have, see what I absolutely must keep, and start listing the rest on eBay.  I could use the money more than the yarn anyway.  *reminds self, it's just yarn, they make more every day*

      But I realize this about myself, and have endeavored to redeem myself today.  (Granted, the pics are all out of date because I took them a few days ago, but anyway....)    A random hat that got lost in the shuffle of FOs.  It's out of less than 1 skein of Colinette Point 5.  It's too big...next time, I use sz 15 needles rather than 17.  Free pattern from  urlLink ChicKnits .    A finished pair of socks!  Again, ignore the scary white legs that my cheap camera interpreted as gray.  I'm most likely never going to wear these, but I'm proud of them anyway!    Mmm, green Kool-Aid.  I think that's probably 10 or 15 rows up the body of the bag (I'm at 30 now).  Patons Classic Wool dyed with some combination of Kool-Aid.  Kiwi something-or-other?  I don't even remember now.    The stitches go marching two-by-two, hurrah, hurrah!  Yep, a whole swath of 2x2 ribbing in rose heather Wool-Ease.  Yes, Kelly, I am working on it, and you'll have it under your tree!  The ends are woven in on Elise's Christmas scarf, and eventually I'll take a picture of that too.  Most likely after I block it, which will be closer to Christmas.  Right now I'm knitting up lace swatches to choose a pattern for Karen's scarf.  I wish more pattern books would specify which stitch patterns are reversible *sigh*

      I came to a lovely realization today.  I can knit standing up...provided said knitting is on circular needles.  Yes, I know this is probably rather stupid and legions of knitters have been practicing their craft on foot since the dawn of time.  But, for me, it means that time spent standing at the bus stop need not be wasted!  Huzzah!  Since the last post I: --finished knitting Elise's scarf (just in time, as I was thoroughly bored with the stitch) --finished Broadripple (they're too big, but thankfully they're cotton so they'll shrink a bit) --started like 17 other projects (okay, not really, but my list has gotten more ADD than usual) --came up with like 17,000 other projects I want to do (less of an exaggeration than above) --finished my Christmas knitting list (at least until I remember all the other people who I want to knit things for) --subscribed to Interweave Knits (first issue is to be mailed on the 22nd) --took no pictures of FOs or even WIPs (sorry!)  Now a run-through on the knitalongs I'm participating in:  Tank-Along update:  I think I'll start a Chickami fairly soon.  There are things about Shapely that I don't particularly like, so most likely I won't make another one, at least not for myself.  Charlotte Women update:  Yeah, I haven't done any more since the last time I posted.  I'm not super-motivated to rush through it, as I won't be wearing it until mid-December, so I'm just taking my time.  Lace-Along update:  Finished one scarf, looking for a lace pattern to start the second (like I said before, I am SO SICK of fan-and-feather)  Sophie-Along update:  I hate picking up stitches, in case anyone's wondering.  The Kool-Aid yarn is working up nicely.  Almost to the first set of decreases (I'm on row 8 of the body I think?)  And I'm off.

      Not so much.  I just didn't really get much of a chance.  I tried to work on F-and-F on the bus trip to Boston, but the seats were way too cramped to work on her with The Boy sitting beside me.  I did start a swatch for the master knitting program...the seed stitch one (#3?  I don't have the sheet in front of me.)  The only reason I could is I bought shorter size 8 needles earlier that day...just for the sole purpose of knitting the swatches :-)  They'll be useful for scarves later.  It looks pretty decent.  I'll probably redo it anyway, because I'm having real problems getting my cast-on even.  You'd think I have plenty of practice now, but the whole time I've been knitting (including the knitting-a-whole-bunch-of-nothing when I was younger) I always used the knitted cast-on.  I could never get the hang of the basic one-needle one...none of the pictures I'd ever seen ANYWHERE made it make any sense to me.  Then a few weeks ago I told myself that I was going to learn it and I was going to like it.  I've nailed the first, and I'm making myself use it every time I cast on for something new, but I still don't have it perfectly even yet.  Which means I don't really like it yet.  (Any tips, anyone?)  Last night I managed to get a few rows done on Charlotte (I've started color 4!) and I started Sarah's HP scarf this morning.  I think I'm also going to make her a condom cozy (a la  urlLink summer Knitty ) in Slytherin colors.  Bwa ha ha.

      Level 1 arrived in the mail today!  I barely want to touch it...I want to keep the instructions immaculate.  Yeah, I'm a dork.  I'm making myself clean the bathroom and computer room and finish Broadripple before I start it.  Hopefully tonight!

      So I'm procrastinating on finishing Broadripple Part Deux.  Grafting the toe and weaving in ends on both socks is all I have left (I finished knitting the toe this morning before catching the bus--gotta find every moment possible to cram knitting into, y'know?).  That leaves me with 3 projects on the needles.  4 seems to be a healthy number for me, and everything I have going is on medium-sized needles.  So I need something on big needles...sounds like Michael's afghan on ass-kicking 35s is the way to go.  Hopefully that'll go fast, because the needles feel like they're going to be really awkward, not to mention working off two cones at the same time.  I need dowels and scrap wood to make a holder before I begin, I think, otherwise I'm going to tie myself together with black and blue Homespun.  Not cool.  Maybe I'll trek over to Aubuchon between work and WW.  Still awaiting the TKGA kit.  Despite all the other stuff I have going, I'm really looking forward to starting it.  Whatever I do, I always want to be better at it, and knitting is no exception.  Bought Space Bags for the yarn stash last night.  For some reason, they aren't helping me fit any more yarn into the cedar chest, probably the shape the bags ended up being after they were vacuumed out.  But I just about cleaned out my 3-drawer thing, except for the kitchen cotton in the top drawer, which doesn't deserve to be in something as cool as a Space Bag.  Realized I have way too much Noro for my own good.  I think the orangey-rusty-red Silk Garden I have is going to turn into a cardi for the fall.  Either Rosedale (from Knitty) or just a simple top-down V-neck (which I have the pattern for from Knitting Plain and Simple).  Probably the V-neck.

      Yes, I have been knitting in between trying to figure out who gets what for Christmas and how to store my yarn.  I have pictures of each project-in-progress (except for one, but I'll get to that).  First off, Charlotte.  The whole thing:    The edge, with the pink-and-yellow yarn I love in focus:    Now, Broadripple.  One and a half socks done:    Please don't mind my glow-in-the-dark-white leg:    Feather and fan scarf:    And up close and personal with Miss Feather-and-Fan:    Amazingly, the colors in every picture are fairly true.  Charlotte (the full view) and Broadripple are a little washed-out, but what do you expect from a cheap digital camera anyway?  Next one I buy will have a better macro mode, so I can get better closeups.  I don't have any pictures of Kelly's sweater yet (Pinup Queen from Stitch N Bitch, if anyone's wondering) for two reasons.  One, it's an inch of 2x2 rib.  Not the most exciting picture in the world.  Two, I left it at a friend's apartment, so I couldn't take even a super-boring picture of it.  Kelly's seen it though, and she approves.

      I meant to take a picture of my progress this morning before work, but guess who got up a weeeeeee bit late.  I finished row 86 last night, out of a total 154.  "Yay!" you say.  "Over halfway done!"  Unfortunately, this close to the end the rows just keep getting longer and longer and looooonnnnnggggeeeeeeeerrrrr.  I haven't figured out how many stitches will be in the last row, but I know it's a lot.  There's a lot on the needle now.  I think the 29" circ I'm using will be long enough for all the stitches though.  I'm going to change the color order a bit, so I can have more of that pretty pink/yellow mix that I mistakenly cast on with when my intention was to use it last.  See if I cast on another Charlotte when I'm overtired again.

      Lots of stuff to show you today!  First off, we have something that arrived in my mailbox on Saturday from an unnamed source in New Jersey:   Sooo soft, and the colors are so intense.  Apparently my camera is tired, because it hasn't captured a color accurately in any sort of light for a couple of weeks now.  Go  urlLink here  for a look at what the colors really look like.  The yarn is similar to Point 5 (which is droolworthy in itself), but MUCH bigger hanks!  Thank you Secret Pal!  If she starts off this strong, I'm wondering what other goodies to expect :-)    And of course I realized I haven't posted any pictures of the finished Feather-And-Fan scarf...here it is!  Plymouth Indiecita Alpaca in raspberry...I used probably 2 1/2 skeins. Also incredibly soft.    This is not really gray.  Honest.  It's a soft sage green that goes perfectly with my bathroom.  This is the pattern from Weekend Knitting.    The sheddy Chinchilla chemo cap.  It turns out soft and silky, but I'm still covered with red fuzz that's been floating around my apartment waiting for clearance to land, apparently.  More of a darker burgundy than the picture shows.  Now I just need to find someplace to send it.  I'd like to send it to somewhere local, but there are national organizations that collect them too.    Now a UFO to go with all the FOs in this post.  Obviously when I'm done with Charlotte I'm going to have to find a better camera, because you MUST see the colors truly.  That green in the middle should be way more intense than the picture shows.  I've got 16 rows to go, which may lead those unfamiliar with the pattern to say, wow, you're almost done!  Let me put it this way....the first row of the pattern had 7 stitches in it.  The row I'm at now has...well, I don't feel like counting now, so let me estimate around 275 stitches.  And I'm just going to keep adding more until the end!  Each row takes around half an hour now, so that's another 8 hours of work before she's done, not counting blocking and edging.  That's a lot of knitting on teeny size 6 needles!

      I finally made the decision to get rid of all my cheapo Red Heart.  Yes, they have this knack for gorgeous colors that I can't resist, but there is no way I'm going to make ANYTHING out of all that.  I rubbed the end of a skein on the underside of my chin and it was painful.  Like I'd wear anything made of that.  That's just going to go to Goodwill.  I also weeded out a bunch of Lion Brand/Bernat stuff....some Wool-Ease in odd colors, the Boucle and Homespun that I will never end up using, and a bunch of Fun Fur...would anyone be interested in that?  I don't want to go to the bother of taking pictures, coming up with prices, blah blah blah, because the whole lot of it isn't worth more than $20 or 30.  I put a list on the destashing page, so check it out and make an offer if you want any of it.  This destashing thing is making me feel sort of free.  I'm trying to declutter in all aspects of my life, not just craft-wise, and it's a good thing.  In knitting content...well, I really have none.  I ran along on the Lace Rib Scarf today while running errands (the pleasant part of taking the bus: free knitting time), and I plan to do a couple more rows on Charlotte tonight, but other than that, I'm just posting to babble about reducing stash.  Go me, and stuff.  Or something.  I should take more WIP pics.  I've got decent progress on a bunch of stuff, so they might be interesting.  *shrug*

      Especially in expensive Noro yarn.  This Shinano is pissing me off anyway, even before the lovely knot I discovered this morning.  I don't know if it's just this batch, but the random patches of unspun roving alternating with what amounts to thread is highly irritating.  The scarf doesn't look bad (except for one patch where 3 rows in a row had roving in the same spot, so there's a big lump there), but it's annoying to work with.  I'd also like to hear back from Interweave about the fact that I haven't received the first issue of my subscription, when the subscription e-mail said it would be mailed on July 22nd.  I e-mailed them asking about it on Monday.  (I e-mailed Vogue Knitting the same day b/c I haven't received the fall issue of that either, and I had a response within  half an hour  saying a replacement issue would be sent out.)  Growl.  I've been making progress on Kelly's sweater, and sending out loads of yarn to people who are all too happy to help me destash.  Yay people!  Sent out my first SP gift last week too.  I'll be anxious to see her reaction.

      The HP Scarf That Ate  Tokyo  Hogwarts is done!  The thing is insanely long and cozy.  It's going to be way too warm for Sarah in AZ, but I hope she likes it just the same.    My first attempt ever at a 3-needle bindoff.  A little awkward, but a heck of a lot better than seaming!    Ignore the messiness behind the scarf.  This thing is long!  It's as long as my bed (6 1/2 feet?)  Now I want one of my own, but I'll make an Azkaban style for myself.  I still need to trim the fringe so it's even, but otherwise it's done!  No more stockinette for me for a while :-)  I've been working on Charlotte too.  Joyous, one row taking 20 minutes...and they're still going to get longer!  It's cold in the lab...I wish I had her done now.

      1. Are you a yarn snob (do you prefer high-end/natural fibers)? Do you avoid Red Heart and Lion Brand? Or is it all the same to you?  Well, sort of.  I haunt the LYS regularly and have an extensive collection of Noro and Brown Sheep, but I also have a load of Wool-Ease that I use on occasion.  I reserve the Red Heart stash I already had for trying new stitches and techniques.  I mostly avoid acrylics because I like soft stuff, and acrylic doesn't usually fit that.  Encore is an exception...it seems to have enough wool in it to be okay.  The next HP scarf I make is going to be in 100% wool though, b/c I live in Maine and need the extra warmth.   2. Do you spin? Crochet?   Well, I bought a drop spindle beginner kit, but I haven't come anywhere close to figuring it out yet.  I may like it, I may not, I don't know.  I'm capable of crocheting (laboriously) and have a couple crochet books, but I MUCH prefer knitting.  Probably because I'm better at it.   3. Do you have any allergies? (smoke, pets, fibers, perfume, etc.)   I claim to be allergic to cigarette smoke because I hate it THAT MUCH, but not really.  I'm sensitive to perfumes, but again, I don't know if that qualifies as allergies.   4. How long have you been knitting?    Ages.  I used to knit squares when I was a kid, and attempted to knit a sweater for the last boyfriend (I gave up on the sweater before I gave up on the boy, actually.)  It's only been recently that I've actually made stuff.   5. Do you have an Amazon or other online wish list?    Yeah, the Amazon list is under himeykitty at hotmail dot com, if you look it up by e-mail.  I suppose I should link it somewhere, but I usually use it for my own reference.   6. What's your favorite scent? (for candles, bath products etc.)   Vanilla, citrusy stuff, fresh grassy-kind of stuff.  My current obsession is The Body Shop's satsuma.   7. Do you have a sweet tooth?    OOOOOH yeah.  I feed it quite well on my own though :-)    8. What other crafts or Do-It-Yourself things do you like to do?   Knitting, that's about it.  I do decorate-y things on occasion.   9. What kind of music do you like? Can your computer/stereo play MP3s? (if you want to make her a CD)    Chick-rock, classic rock, hard rock, world music (especially African, Middle Eastern, and Celtic) and trance.  I'm always on the lookout for completely random cover songs.  Tori Amos and BNL are good for those :-)   10. What's your favorite color? Or--do you have a color family/season/palette you prefer?    Yellow, blue, brighter pastel-y types, and darker browns.  Pretty much any green except the really bright neon ones.   11. What is your family situation? Do you have any pets?   Live alone, owned by one cat, have a boyfriend who I only see on weekends (he lives two hours away, bah).   12. What are your life dreams? (really stretching it here, I know)   Not sure yet...to save up enough money so I can stay at home and knit?

      I was talking to the ladies at the LYS (by the way, I have an interview for a part time position there on Monday!) and mentioned my fear of colorwork.  I'm the type of person who will knit random complicated lace and cable patterns for fun (somewhere along the lines of the math nerd who will do double and triple integrals just because (s)he can), but I'm scared of simple Fair Isle type colorwork.  So today I'm picking up my trusty copy of Knitting for Dummies, I'm taking out two different colors of OTNSY (Official Trying-New-Stuff Yarn), and going to it.  So far so good, but lord, all the ends to weave!  Started a Chinchilla chemo cap the other night.  That stuff sheds on the hands like a Persian cat in Death Valley, CA.  Needless to say, I got impatient before I put it down to pick back up another, less hot day.  Wonder what the feasibility of making a felted sleeve for my laptop is.  I have all this random Cascade 220, and if this FI thing works, I could use some of it for that.

      I keep going through my yarn and finding things that I need to get rid of.  I'm being surprisingly ruthless, considering my packrat tendencies.  I've decided that I need to come up with some sort of project for everything I'm keeping, and if I can't think of anything it goes.  I did a couple of things on my knitting to-do list from yesterday.  I shopped for my Secret Pal (that package will go out tomorrow), I worked on the Slyth scarf (4 stripes and a Metric Butt-Ton of fringe to go!), and I at least unearthed the yarn for my Chickami with the intent of balling it, but I also have to unearth my swift at some point.  I also put all the yarn for my Christmas knitting in one container, to make it all easier to find.  Other than that, not much on the knitting front.  I have no new pictures for you.  I'm still bored with all of my projects.  Maybe I'll go work on Charlotte when I'm done sorting through stash.  The colors make me happy.

      --Ball yarn for Chickami --Work on Slyth scarf on bus and on car ride to Skowhegan tonight --Work on sweater --Do a couple rows on Charlotte (which is easier said than done...the rows are getting LONG!) --Continue to reorg (and WEED OUT!) yarn stash --Shop for SP --Start listing stuff on eBay --Finish something, gawd dammit!  It's been hot and un-knitty-motivating lately, much as I want to, but it's a bit cooler now, so maybe something on this list will get done!  (I know the shopping part will be done today at least *grin*)

         Besides the fact that the pic is WAY TOO YELLOW, she's gorgeous!  The Boy was amazed at how much she shrunk when she was felted.  For comparison, here's the prefelted bag, hung on the very same doorknob:     What a difference, huh?  I need to go shopping for my Secret Pal soon.  Tomorrow probably.  It's REALLY HOT today.  Yes, the caps are necessary.  I put more yarn up for sale.  Kureyon, of course.
