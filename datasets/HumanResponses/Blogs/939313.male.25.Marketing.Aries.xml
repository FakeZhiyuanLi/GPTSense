      well just finishing off the day at the office. 6:20 pm hmm still early by my standards. my mind is still contemplating how in this day and age if we dont multitask, we die. well that might be putting it bluntly but seriously, we are always runnin out of time to do stuff. Putting of an assignment cause you wanna go out with your girlfriend. Having to delay submitting work cause you would rather spend time chatting endlessly to faceless peers at the other end of thousands of endless cables. You could probably name a gazillion of examples where time is no longer enough for us to cruise our way through life. Then you start to wonder, hey why don't i try to do everything all at the same time? It might start with replying an email while you are writing a report. This could probably lead to what i am doing now at the moment, listening to incubus while preparing some graphs for my boss which requires some data entry and number crunching tasks whilst at the same time alt tabbing to write this blog. This is just the beginning. After this you'll probably see a guy going out with 2 different girls at the same time.. Hey I'm multitasking man..

      this is my first entry into the world of blog. based on a recommendation of a very good friend who professed that she was an avid blogger, i decided to give it a shot as i probably need some practice on my writing anyways. so how do we start? they say even the longest journey begins with the first step, well here we go...

      My sister passed away last week. Still couldn't believe that she is gone. One minute everything was okay, in an instant everything can change. Regrets are aflowing. Why didn't i make the most of my time with her that morning?

      currently listening to U2. "in the name of love one more in the name of love" the things that we do in the name of love. if people take the time to really understand this concept maybe the world would be a better place.... well enough with that already. lets get back to business. the business of mindless jabbering. in this day and age there are a lot of business opportunities cropping up here in there. people are on the verge of their seat waiting for the next big thing to come along. the dot com boom came and went. and now it seems that were moving into the realms of the MLMs. multi level marketing and all that baggage that comes with it. talk about empowerment to the consumer, using our collective purchasing power to gain savings for ourselves and make money for others. it all looks so simple and in truth there are a number of self made millionares ( well not exactly self made but there's an element of it in there..somewhere) floating around flaunting their new found riches enticing others to take the bold step, to make that leap of faith to join the business. well what are the repercussions of these schemes? hmm what ARE the repercussions.. lets think about it..

      a friend of mine pointed out that we can take the mickey out of something in the most subtlest of ways. imagine a man utd fan taking a photo infront of an Arsenal poster with just the ARSE showing... pretty clever.. let see what she can come up with next...

      well hope that everyone had an enjoyable weekend. i know i did. spent the post valentine saturday helping my girlfirend paint her house. well when i say helping i say it loosely in a sense that i only helped in holding the paint in place for her while she did the painting. why did i do this you might ask? well on in the name of keeping my sweetheart happy. there are those types of people who can only be satisfied if they know that something is being done correctly. for example if you paint it a little to thin or maybe its uneven or stuff like that. they will probably go nuts. its better if they did it themselves. hehe anyways that was not the highlight of the weekend. the highlight of my weekend was certainly the sweet revenge of watching Arsenal beat Man Utd 2-0 at Old Trafford. saw it live on TV ( my girlfriend is a Man U fan so enjoyed rubbing it in a little bit) wish every week would be like that..

      hmm a lot has happen since the last time i wrote in this blog. well for starters i am officially off the 'meat market' with me getting engaged with my girlfriend on the 13th of April 2003. Arsenal and Man U are neck and neck for the EPL crown. and loads of other not so significant events. well we had that whole war in Iraq and the SARS outbreak.. come to think of it the world seems to go on despite the fact that i'm being oblivious to it..

      kingdomality http://www.cmi-lmi.com/kingdomality.html  Your distinct personality, The White Knight, might be found in most of the thriving kingdoms of the time. Don Quixote was a White Knight as was Joan of Arc, the Lone Ranger and Crusader Rabbit. As a White Knight you expect nothing in return for your good deeds. You are one of the true "Givers" of the world. You are the anonymous philanthropist who shares your wealth, your time and your life with others. To give, is its own reward and as a White Knight you seek no other. On the positive side you are merciful, sympathetic, helpful, giving and heroic. On the negative side you may be impulsively decisive, sentimental and misdirected. Interestingly, your preference is just as applicable in today's corporate kingdoms.

      i must say that the temptations of technology is very great. Every new hardware release tends to make the hand grow itchy to pull out the old wallet and kindly depart with a few ( i wish ) dollars worth of your hard earned money. My current affliction is with those handy gadgets we call the PDA. I currently own a Palm M505 just over a year old and its fast looking dated compared to the newer models. My initial forray into the world of the gizmoz and gadgets started when i spent 500 ringgit that i got from working as a part-time teacher to buy a flashy G-Shock watch that can store your personal details and phone numbers of your friends. This at a time when i don't even have a handphone but hey there was a certain novelty factor to it. I wore it all the way to Uni and i must say it served its purpose very well. Then one day whilst out shopping in Blackburn i came across this store which was selling a Phillips Velo, for like 70 quid almost half the price at the time. It still functioned despite being a display model. That was technically my first PDA. Got several stare when i whipped it out to copy notes  in college, even a lecturer commented that during his time we took notes on paper (quoted loosely from Pelham Gore). Running Windows CE it had 8 MB of ram, back litted no colors. But it was still a good machine. I had to download the manual from the internet cause it didn't come with one. Surprised to see that there was effectively no support because the model got discontinued. Anyways that machine really got me going. When i got back i got myself the Palm. the handy machine is where i write my notes, browse the net, keep organized play games and a whole lot more. It makes me wonder how i have managed to get thru my life without it.. and then i start to wonder some more.. what if the gadgets we have that makes our life easy to the point that we are void of any physical or personal contact whatsoever? Can we be content from a relationship that exist only virtually? To what extent do we allow ourselves to be "controlled" by our pursuit to make life easier thru technology?

      18/6/03 8:58 am The story of my life  there was always and excuse, for me to change my mind, can't seem to remember what it was, that made me so blind.  I couldn't tell if i was awake, going in circles around the bend, from the outside looking in, there's no time to feel the pain.  still you make me believe, i could soar amongst the clouds, although i'm blinded by the sight, i try to listen to the sound

       Assalamualaikum dan salam sejahtera.   pantun orang kahwin,  kekasih berkolek di sungai mersing, di buai arus menari-menari 10 tahun persahabatan terjalin, dijinjang pelamin termeterai janji,   megah berdiri pohon meranti, tempat berteduh burung merpati, ezura dan muzamil tampak berseri, ikatan perkahwinan kukuh bersemi,  Bersyukur ke hadhrat ilahi kerna dengan limpah kurnianya kita semua dapat bersama pada hari ini untuk meraikan penyatuan dua insan yang saling menyintai, saling mengasihi, complementing one another in an endless cycle of love and commitment. I got to know muz and Eju during the first year of a-levels, muz and eju were friends long before that, and it is good to see the fruits of their labour coming to fruition.   baiklah untuk tidak melengah...  ============================= well a close friend of mine got married last Saturday. both of them have been going out for awhile, its natural progression that they'd end up with one another. I am happy for them both. In fact when Muz completed the "nikah" i could feel a tear welling up in my eyes. Its not everyday you get to see two people, totally in love with one another, complete the transition into the next phase of their lives.   Whne they'd asked me to become the MC for the ceremonies on Sunday, I immediately said yes. Being someone who never shies away from any challenge this is not that difficult. But i could have probably done better. I need to change my habit of being a last minute person. Sometimes u cud get away with doing something on the fly, but i think u can get better results if u do all the necessary preparations before hand. Luckily no one got embarassed and i managed to go through the whole thing without cracking up my usual wisecracks.  The wedding reception itself was a simple affair. I particularly liked the way the newlyweds were able to mingle around with their friends after the ceremony formally ended. It was like a mini reunion for them all because some of them have not seen eachother for awhile. Well it usually takes some weddings or even a funeral for people to meet up with each other. What with being endessly busy with work and all that, people tend to forget the things that matter the most in life, family and good friends...

       Is it a new beginning?   sometimes you wonder about the decisions that u make and the things that u do. did I thought everything thru? what if i left out something and my judgement is not based on something complete? am i willing to sacrifice everything for the mere thrill of acting on impulse?  tbc

      So now everything is back to square one. Its like somebody pressed the reset button on my so called life. Its true what they say that we can only plan but in the end no one knows. Just when you think you've got you're life all figured out, a sudden change just rocks you and you're knocked off the sofa of you own comfort zone. You're in a land of the unexpected, looking at things from a different perspective.   Don't get me wrong. I am all for change if it makes you better. What if by changing you're just going to be worse off? Do you change strictly for change sake? Or do you say screw the world if they can't accept me for who i am then don't bother..

      Funny how everything in life tend to return full circle. The more obvious example being the cycle of life. The not so obvious is how an email u forward comes back to you (albeit not via the same thread). Things have the tendency to tap u on the back and say its me again baby..

       urlLink The Band's Website   Here's to the revival of the local music scene.. I bought the album simply to satisfy my curiosity over this local band that has a so similar vocal sound to Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam. In fact when i first listen to their single Crumbs, i thought to myself when did PJ released a new single? Anyways thats so much where the similarity ends. Disagree is much their own band as any. Their songs are haunting and quite pleasing to the ears and the lyrics are simple enuff without being overly pretentious. All in all i give this album a rating of 5 outta 5 and i hope that these guys will keep on rocking so that the world would know that rock still lives in Malaysia.

      I'm feeling a bit frisky today. Wore my new pink shirt to work and managed to draw a positive response from my colleague. Even though i stick out like a sore (pink) thumb but hey its just my way of being different. But nowadays it is more accepted for guys to wear pink. Its not saying that i'm a wuss, i just love the color.. :)

prof_sadin (5:23:35 PM): where as his multi-dating thing already depicts that pacatbeso (5:23:45 PM): playboy being someone who plays around, maybe a scene where he dates different women would suffice prof_sadin (5:23:52 PM): why, when it comes to 'copying' the West prof_sadin (5:24:08 PM): we go to the extreme to follow the more negative aspects prof_sadin (5:24:14 PM): and ignore the positives?

      We like to talk about what ifs. What if i did this, what if i did that. What if i don't get married. What if i won a million dollars. The thing about what ifs is we're always safe in the comfort that it is always a mute point. We only question what if after we've passed that certain point where there's not actually a way for us to turn back and decide otherwise, more of looking back in regret kinda thing. The thing is, life is full of choices and we have to live with the ones we made, regardles of it being a good choice or a bad choice. We make do with life as how we've decided to live it..

      Read in the sun this morning  urlLink that a man had died while chasing away a snatch thief . The man was driving his van on his way to work when he saw someone trying to snatch this lady's handbag at a bus stop. He pulled over and gave chase with his wife and a relative. He managed to caught the dude exchange some blows before the thief manages to escape into a dark alleyway.   He followed suit leaving his wife and relative behind. The wife got worried when the man didn't return after a while and decided to go look.. Surprise-surprise the man was found lain on the ground all bloodied and stabbed.. The man was believed to have died on his way to hospital.  I hate snatch thieves. I f****** hate them with a vengeance. Its personal. Not that I have ever been a victim but I did have a sister who had been victimized twice by these so called petty criminals. Well by the looks of things they are not petty anymore. We've had snatch theft case since ages before but lately things have been getting worse. People getting into comas and even dying because of this low lifes.  I believe if ever I was in the man's position I'd probably go and give chase as well. But looking back in retrospect its probably because of the hate I have for these types of criminals. Not because of wanting to become a hero or for personal glory or s*** like that.   I have no respect for people who'd go around on motorbikes scouting out old makciks and women who are unawares, and just taking their opportunity to grab what ever they can, and even sometimes inflict personal harm on their victims.  I'm not saying that we all need to follow the man's example, give chase, get stabbed bleed to death. When certain risks are involved we need to be sure that we're able to take some calculated ones.  Always remember that your safety is always first. Duit boleh cari but nyawa hilang takde warranty. Whenever possible get the police to help. It is their job anyways. If not, when giving chase to snatch thieves always make sure u don't go at it alone. Find a posse or something. But don't la become a lynch mob and string the dude up the nearest lamp post (although that idea does sound tempting)  Well its all good and well to talk here, but lives are lost in trying to stop these criminals. Condolences to the families and also to the families of the victims that has past away.

      I stayed up until close to 4 am this morning. I knew that there wasn't any footie on but i was finding it hard to go to sleep. Switched on the telly and Wimbledon was on. Saw Henman close to beating Mark Phillipoussis (thats a mouthful eh), confirmed the results in the news this morning.  Its kinda weird not having footie today. Heheh but i guess they do need the rest before the semis.   So wadya do when there's no footie? U sleep la catch up on all the time loss staying up for the previous games.. but no.. i had to go and stay up anyways and watch wimbledon..   Anyways time to get back to work (eyes red and dreary and ngantuks)

      Watched Kill Bill 2. A bit dissapointed with the ending but hey after all the carnage in Volume 1, the movie needed an ending, just didn't expect it to be like that..  Anyways without wanting to spoil the movie for those that have not watch it, isn't it kinda cool if u could do that finishing move. Heheh 5 point palm exploding heart technique.   Imagine knowing that ur gonna die when u take 5 steps. Or to make it more interesting. Imagine knowing exactly how and when ur gonna die? A little bit like that movie Big Fish. Albert Finney's and Ewan McGreggor's character lived his life to fullest (yeah although he stretched his stories a bit but hey all good storytellers do some stretching eh). Well you wouldn't be afraid if u know that ur life is not gonna end in whatever is it u wanna do eh.   Well the truth is we don't know when we're gonna kick the bucket. We just move along taking things as they come. The important thing is to make the most of our time... in what ever way that u choose to live.

      Remember the carefree times of youth. Where the only worrying thing was well.. nothing. How we just go through life oblivious of our surrounding generally just having a good time? Well those days are gone for good. Now u have to bear a lot of responsibilities, starting a family, ur job and all that lies in between.   Well i'm just feeling a bit nervous. I am geting married in a months time. And for those who's wondering when the invites are gonna come, heheh i'm working on it at the moment. Its kinda overwhelming, the whole process. I mean financial bits aside, are u really sure that ur mentally ready or not?   Marriage is not just about the sex. There's the emotional side to it as well. I've always thought that i'm definitely ready to get married. But the closer i come to the day, the more i tend to reassess my situation.  Trust me i'm not having doubts or stuff like that. I love my Syaz to bits and i'd do anything to make things work with her. Its just the thought of spending the rest of ur life with someone.. well its a big decision not to to be take lightly..

      Yesterday's game was as nervewrecking for me as it was in 2000 when Holland faced Italy in the semi's of Euro 2000 and were knocked out on penalties. When Cocu missed his kicked after Ibrahimovic had missed his earlier i thought to myself ok, not again. But in the end Van der Sar made a brilliant save to stop Melberg from scoring and it was down to Robben to put the winning penalty in.        Fourth time lucky eh      So Holland are through to the semi's.. Wei hei

      I took a cab to the LRT station today. Since I was running late from a late night of footie. England losing on penalties 6 - 5 to Portugal. Not that I'm an England fan.  Anyways the cabbie was telling me how he had picked up two young girls from Hentian Bas Putra, who were from Pasir Gudang had wanted to go to a house in Taman Permata, they knew the street number but not the house number. The cabbie said that those two probably had ran away from home or something like that. He told me that he tried to advise the girls that running away is not the best option to take. How maybe they were fed with this dream that all in KL is rosy and how u cud make something out of urself in the big city. But a lot of things can happen.   For instance, they might end up in vice. Prostitution of young girls is rampant in certain parts. They might get mixed up with the wrong crowd. Get themselves involved in drugs (the cabbie commented that maybe those two were high on grass, due to them being "lalok" red-eyed and blurry but maybe that's just the long trip eh)  Well suffice to say the cabbie took 45 minutes circling the block to find the house but failed so he just dropped them off. What more can he do? Well for that matter what more can we do?  We're currently living in a society of "if it doesn't concern me then screw it lah". The recent rise in snatch thefts and petty crimes is a proof of that. I remembered Hitz FM call in in one of their morning shows sessions saying that Malaysians just wouldn't bother to help if it doesn't immediately affect themselves. I know that its never good to generalize but sometimes the actions of the many speaks more than enough.   Its like we're too tied up with events surrounding our own existence to even bother about others. Like pretending to sleep in an LRT when u see a pregnant woman stand on the side, just hoping that someone else would give up their seat.   We always wait for others to do the right thing and just hope for the best. We tend not to take the initiative and just be less selfish.  Anyways getting back to the topic what more can we do about our youths today. I believe that everything must begin at home. The home environment is pivotal towards youth development. A lot of the things that influences us we learn while we're at home. Well u may dispute that if u want. Imagine living in a home where ur parents were never there, always busy working and stuff like that, u crave the attention but there's no one to get it from, u start to rebel etc etc.  That's like a typical scenario that occurs today. Well we really need to sit down and look back at what our priorities are. Sometimes in our search for riches and wealth we tend to lose sight of what is more important. Family, love and stuff like that.  Well it makes u wonder weather or not ur ready to take that leap, to have a family of ur own, will u be able to not make the same mistakes that others have made? Or will u fall down the same rabbit hole and become part of the statistics..

      England are out of the Euro 2004 tourney after battling bravely to earn a 2 - 2 draw into extra time. Then came the dreaded penalty shootout. England were never lucky in penalty shootouts remember Euro 96? Well as luck might have it they were unlucky this time as well.       That ball is mine..      Beckham blazed one over the bar. When Rui Costa managed to do the same, it was down to the heroics of the keeper Ricardo, who managed to save Vassel's kick and also scored the winning penalty.  So now England are left to rue the chances they had to win the group, maybe set up an "easier" match against Greece. Well we'll never know now. As to quote a line from Abg Amirul of Lancaster, "Kalau bercakap tentang kalau ni takkan habis". Well there will always be Germany 06 eh..

            Its a little too hazy..

Reports in the papers saying thats its clearing up in another 5 days. But u really can feel the effects of the poor air quality. Allegedly its all the burning in Indonesia, clearing up off agricultural sites and all that, plus with the winds shifting (quoting loosely an explanation by a colleague of mine) bringing the brunt of the haze to our shores.   Anyways, visibility is quite poor. Heard of numerous accidents happening where u just couldn't see the cars infront of ya. Hopefully everything will clear up soon. Maybe if it'd rain tonight, then it would help alleviate the condition eh..

      Well love him or hate him, Ruud van Nistelrooy was pivotal towards Holland qualifying for the quarter finals. Scoring twice in a 3 - 0 win against Latvia, Nistelrooy showed why he is one of the more potent strikers in Europe. The way he takes his chances (and also spurns them) is quite spectacular. But Ruud is Ruud and he does what he does. Score goals.  With Germany failing to win over the Czechs, having led by a brilliant strike from Ballack but managing to lose 1 - 2, the Oranjes qualify instead with 4 points. That sets them up quite nicely for a match against Sweden. I'm hoping for a cracking game for this one.        Its not me fault i played for Utd..

      Got into the office the morning all set for a 10 o'clock meeting. My boss told me to present some stuff for the meeting. I was like okay, hehe could've notified me earlier eh. But i was up for the challenge, honestly. But then during the meeeting he ended up doing the whole presentation which although was a relief for me, made me wonder as to how the boss think of my capabilities. Maybe he was spurred to continue on or maybe he felt that i wasn't prepared. Anyways, i'll be prepared the next time eh..  In other news Italy were knocked out of the Euro 04 despite winning 2 - 1 against Bulgaria. Sweden managing a last minute equaliser with Denmark 2 - 2. Smells like conspiracy? Well no way of proving it now. But Italy didn't do much in their last two games to convince me that they really deserved to qualify. So maybe the result was fair.   Now its down to the last qualifying spot. Germany, Netherlands and Latvia. Will attempt to accompany the Czechs from group D into the last eight. I've already conceded that Holland will be joining the elite group of losers, Spain, Italy to pack their bags and go home. But miracles do happen. Does anyone know how the Czechs' reserve team performance is?

      There's a new kid on the block. Owen who? Now is the time of Wayne Rooney the next wunderkind out of the Merseyside production line. Having scored a brace in last nights 4 - 2 win over Croatia, his total Euro tally is currently 4 goals making him the top scorer of the tourney.     Ooh fancy that! This ball's going in my son..   Well England do need him to be at his best when they face the host Portugal in the quarterfinals.  Well i'm not much of an England fan. Syaze commented to me last night that she argued with her client about how UK grads tend to not support England. I dunno if its true or not. But me personally having been conditioned for a year and a half in Scotland does have this strange animosity towards the England team. Its not that i hate them with a vengeance or some s*** like that. Its just heheh I dunno probably caught it from the Scots.  Anyways i wish the England squad all the best for their match against Portugal. Its going to be tough. Lets just see who's more determined to go through.   Elsewhere in group B: France beat Switzerland 3 - 1. To top the group and will face Greece in the quarterfinals. Thierry Henry breaks his Euro 04 duck with two goals.

      I'm lying awake at the moment. contemplating staying up to watch footie and also thinking about platonic relationships. Can  opposite sexes remain friends without having any other feelings? Is it logical that feelings don't develop when ur that close to a person? Anyways, speaking from personal experience, i had a close female friend back in "sekolah menengah" and at the time i had just broken up with me girlfriend (yeah yeah cinta monyet kinda crap). Well me and this friend were close she helped me through the rough times and all that.   I really appreciated her being there for me but for me she was just a close friend. I was caught by surprise when suddenly she confessed that she had feelings for me. But i just couldn't accept that there would be anything else but friendship for us both. In the end, the friendship deteriorated, although we made it clear that even though i couldn't accept her love, we would still remain friends. But it just couldn't work.   Anyways, suffice to say that she's now happy in her life and i'm quite happy with mine.  The point from all this is, platonic relationships can exist. But being close to person, spending lotsa times together, being "best friends" its hard to prevent feelings from developing. Its up to u to exercise a certain degree of control. Its all good when ur like both single or something like that but what if ur already in a relationship? U spend more time with ur friend than ur partner. Things can go awry.

      Despite leading 2 - 0 at one point, Holland still manages to lose 2 - 3 to the Czechs. It was a very fast paced game. Controversy galore with both of Hollands goals and quick thinking Czechs provided the best comeback of the tournament coming up with the winning goal at the 88th minute leaving the Dutch hanging by a thread towards qualifying to the quarters. Well there's still hope what with Germany only managing to draw against Latvia 0 - 0. Now with the Czechs confirmed in the quarterfinals, Germany, Holland and Latvia still are in it to qualify.     Upbeat Netherlands fans before German match.. not so upbeat now eh..   Elsewhere in group A Portugal won against Spain for the first time in 23 years to book a place in the quarterfinals. Along with Greece, who despite losing to the Russians, were through based on goals scored. That leaves the perennial underachievers Spain outta the tourney along with Russia in the group.  Anyways, still hoping the Dutch to qualify, or at least put on a performance against Latvia worthy of the Oranjes. Hehehe it would so suck if they were to go out now..

      England fought back from the dissapointment of loosing to France with a semi-drubbing of Switzerland. Wayne Rooney scored twice to become the youngest goalscorer in the competition while Stevie Gerrard completed the 3 - 0 scoreline. The swiss didn't play that bad mind u. They were up for the task in the opening minutes but the English were more determined to win hence the scoreline.  France however were lucky to scrape off with a draw against Croatia. Saw the highlights this morning and apparently there was some controversy over the French equalizer. But that result leaves the group quite open. France, England, Croatia and mathematically Switzerland still have a chance to qualify for the quarterfinals. This will lead to an exciting close to the group stages.  Anyways, i'm wondering how Italy will cope tonight what with their talismanic player Francesco Totti being suspended for 3 games for unsportsmanly conduct. With Trappatoni having built a team around Totti, he would now have to reshuffle his pack for the match against Sweden who are currently on a high from thrashing Bulgaria 5 - 0. Well all the best to Italy. I'm sure the rest of the team would want to prove their worth and try to win even without Totti.

      Well studying medicine is not easy. It takes a lot of hard work and u really need to have the stomach to cope with the prospect of long hours and not so extravagant pay (if u work for the govt that is). So when u got 128 students who are eager to study medicine and have the results to back it up, u don't go and say "sorry there's no place for u here". U'd do something about it.   Suffice to say the govt did something about it and now 128 prospective medical students are enrolled in their respective public and private colleges. Hopefully they all will turn out to be good doctors coz we are so in need of doctors now.  The idea of introducing a Medical Student Admission Test (MSAT) is also good. At least u can weed out the keen from the not so keen. Some people study medicine just for the heck of it and when they realize that they don't have what it takes they tend to just drop out or change courses. Knew a dude who dropped out from studying medicine and now he's like some rap artist. Anyways if we can get those who are really interested and really have what it takes to become doctors I'm sure we won't suffer from doctor shortages anymore..

      Last night group A matches went by without much notice. I watch Morientes score for Spain and then went to sleep. Apparently the Greeks drew 1 - 1 with Spain and that pretty much left the group quite open with Portugal having eliminated Russia 2 - 0. Now Spain and Portugal both need to win in their final encounter, leaving Greece in quite a favorable position entering their last match against Russia who as it stands have nothing to gain from their last match.  Well this is quite an interesting predicament. Spain and Portugal are desperate to shrug their underachievers tag in major tournaments whilst the unfancied Greeks are cruising into the last 8.

      I bought my first (and only) pair of Oakley shades in Cardiff. Bought it with the money i got from picking tomatoes during the summer holidays of 1999 i think. Paid a lot for it and at the time i decided that i was going to utilize it to the max. So began the journey of the Oakley shades. I wear it when i go out, on my way to class, to town, wear it on my dates with syaze, it goes with me everywhere. In other words i never leave it behind.  Its not like i'm some sorta weirdo who wears shades in shopping complexes outta the sun. I just wear them because i can. I chose to wear them and nothing anyone can say will make me change my mind about wearing them. They look cool plus they do serve another minor purpose.  The shades sorta shields u from the outside world. I like to watch people. Not that i'm a pervert or something like that. I just like to analyze people's behaviour. U know people tend to act differently when they feel that no one's looking. And the shades really helps. U also get to check out the hot chicks in the LRT. Heheh well i got this interesting theory i dunno if its true or not but do u guys notice, the closer u get to being married the more number of hot looking women sorta suddenly appears? Maybe its just me but i found that the number of attractive women around the LRT/KLCC area are like suddenly increasing. Heheh maybe i can jot down the stats and do a proper report... heheh nah forget about it..

      The game kicked off at 2:45 am local time. Around 30 minutes after the other group D game between the Czech and Latvia ended. The Czech won the game 2 - 1 coming from behind when the unfancied Latvians took the lead in the first half.   Anyways i have always supported Holland since France 98. They have this flamboyant footballing style that made them a joy to watch on the field. Sadly this was clearly absent in their opening match against Germany. They experimented with a 4-3-3 formation with Nistelrooy as the lone striker flanked by to wide men namely Van der Meyde and Van der Vaart. They created some chances in the opening minutes but from then on it was the Germans who were more in control. Then they let in that soft goal from a freekick by Torsten Frings. The Dutch were outta sorts. When Advocaat made the second half changes bringing in Overmars and Sneijder for Zenden and Davids, the Dutch attack sprung to life. More crosses were coming from Overmars and they were piling on the pressure.  Then finally in the 73rd minute the Dutch brought in another striker. Van Hooijdonk presence gave the Dutch the edge they need in winning more headers in advance attacking positions. In the end the equaliser had to come. Van Nistelrooy doing what he does best. Scoring from a cross from Van der Meyde. Truly a goalpoacher at his best. Saving the Dutch some opening day blushes and the Netherlands and Germany shared a point.  All in all this isn't a bad result for the Dutch. However i was dissapointed with how they played. They couldn't penetrate the German defence with the lone striker approach and the wide men were ineffective. Something drastic needs to be done when they face the Czechs and Latvia in their next group game. Come on Holland..

         Well slightly deviating from the topic of football that has taken centre stage in this blog. I just wanna share with ya'll a pic of me nephew, Nabil.

Hmm better ask the future missus that coz its not me whose going to do all the hard work right.

      Saw the game live on 8TV. I must say the scoreline does not do justice to the end to end stuff that happened on the pitch. There were some clear cut chances at both ends but both the keepers Sorensen and Buffon held their ground and that meant that both teams were left to share the spoils. The other match in the group was a different affair. Sweden thrashed Bulgaria 5-0. Larsson scoring two goals and spurning the chance of a hattrick to let Ibrahimovic on the scoresheet. It was an amazing display of teamwork and footballing fluidity.   Anyways, i'm looking forward for tonight's game, The Netherlands vs Germany. Since both teams had crappy results in their repective pre tourney friendlies i'm sure they'll be playing their hearts out to prove their doubters wrong. Heheh or they'd just defend like crazy and hope for a draw.   Anyways i only have one thing to say about the scheduling. Living in Malaysia during the Euro sucks because of the timing. Hehehe stay up all nite, ur semi awake in the office all morning. I dunno how long i can keep this up eh.. heheh

      France won their opening game against England. I only woken up to catch the last 4 minutes of the game and it was well worth it. A deft freekick and a penalty was all it took to break England hearts. Zidane giving everyone a masterclass in being cool, calm and collected.   Well its not that England played poorly. At times they were much in control, leaving the French running out of ideas to break their defence. But alas it was not to be. Beckham will be left ruing his missed penalty, Gerrard on why the hell did he have to make that suicidal backpass and James on why did he have to wake up this morning.. heheh  I'm sure England will pick themselves up and prep themselves for the next match. Just hope that the valuable lesson learnt today will be remembered, the game ain't over till the ref blows the whistle..

      I was on my way to work, turned on the radio and listened to Hitz FM's morning show. Rudy the dj was calling up this Azah from that 3R show talking about how long does it take for her to get ready, spruced up for a shoot or what not. Azah commented that when she had her hair long it took 45 minutes just to do her hair. That's enuff time to play half a footie match. Just for the hair. And when u add in the time to pick the outfit, matching shoes.. That's easily hours down the drain.   I shouldn't be generalizing and say that this only applies to women. Because nowadays with the trend of guys being metrosexuals, we are becoming more and more obsessed with our appearance. Personally, I couldn't care less how I look when I go out and stuff. Probably because I take for granted that I'm already engaged and I'm not presenting myself as a dish on the menu for the other women out there. I have this one favorite shirt that my mom got me in 1994 when I was sent off to boarding school that I still wore till this day. The shirt survived 2 gruelling years in Pengkalan Chepa, 18 months in Perth Scotland, and 4 years of Uni in Lancaster. It has more holes in it than a block of Swiss cheese. Every time I wear it my mom would go, "Takde t-shirt lain ke.. Malu la mummy,". She even bought me a new shirt, slightly similar design a bit snug fitting, (too snug for my liking) in the hopes of me abandoning my favorite shirt. Call me sentimental but I just love that shirt.   What does a t-shirt have to do with the long time we take in getting ourselves ready? Hmm well for starters you won't spend as much time picking out clothes when u already know what ur going to wear. U just need to condition urself to the constant comments u get every time u go out in the same shirt,"Wei takde baju lain ke??,". Heck, if I don't care why should the others care right??  Still I do make an effort to make myself presentable for the times I go out with my girl. She might say other wise but I have to admit that I do take care in not wearing that torn Gap cargo pants that she sorta hates, attempts to shave (failing miserably since I kinda like that gruff "ganas" look), and try to go for that color coordinated look that some couples go for. Hehe still I always managed to squeeze in that t-shirt every now and then. Hey just call me sentimental...

         Sometimes i find myself staring at a wall when i'm in company of friends. Sometimes not always. When i'm in a large gathering of friends or relatives the first thing that i look for are those "lil uns" budak-budak kecik yang tak tahu ape-ape. Playing with kids give me greater pleasure then engaging in conversations with the so called adults. A baby never lies. If they dont like u they cry, thats quite obvious. If they like you they laugh and all is well. Its a different kinda story with adults. We adults are more proficient in concealing what we really mean. "Oh thats such a nice shirt, its pink" a simple compliment that probably means "Such a wuss. I wouldn't be caught dead in that color". We live in a world where euphemism is considered being polite and no one says what they really mean anymore. So we're left to filter through all the words and attempt to make our own interpretation. Its like reading through all the news headlines. What is fact? Where is the fiction? Oh how life would be much simpler if we all just tell the truth. It might not be a happier place though. How can it be if ur going to tell the truth to that age old question women always ask us men... Do i look fat??   Incidentally the pic is taken from inside the office, from the window which faces the KL tower. Wished i could just open the windows and float down from here...

         If u walk from KLCC to the Ampang LRT Station (pass Citibank and Hotel Nikko), u will pass this point where i took this picture. The sight of the twin towers in between two buildings always gives me the sense of wonder and amazement and also makes me quicken my pace to go back to the office cause i'm probably way pass my lunch break and i don't have time gawking at the scenery while there's a pile of work to be done in the office :)

      I just put a hit counter on this blogg. What is it with our fascination with numbers. How many friends we have on friendster? How many hits did our website got? The thing is with some counters it doesn't necessarily reflect the number of person who has visited ur site. I mean if i refresh my page like a million times.. hehe like i'm gonna do that.. hmm am i?

      The front page of the Sun had  urlLink "Caning demos stopped"  printed on it. As i was on my way in the LRT i couldn't stop but wonder about the whole thing. Recently there was a great furore over the whole thing. The human rights commission (SUHAKAM) felt that it gave out a wrong message to the young minds of the school children to whom the demo's were shown to. They cited arguments like it would give these kids the impression that it would be okay to inflict severe torture to another human being. For me personally the demo's themselves is a great idea. What with the recent increase in crime such as rape, snatch theft and what not, it is good that we expose the repercussions and consequences of these criminal acts to the young more as a deterrent. Get them while we can still influence their mind. Melentur buluh biar dari rebung. I think we should give our youngins some credit. Come on laa, children nowadays are better than that. I think when the kids see the demo's they wouldn't want to be in that situation. Leading to two possible scenarios; one) They'll stay away from committing any crime or two) They'll figured out innovative ways of not getting caught. Heheh come to think of it the latter is also likely. So what are we to do eh??

      well, started the morning well enough. had me parents call up syaze's dad to finalize proceedings before the big day on saturday. so we'll be leaving after Maghrib straight to her house. then hopefully we can wrap things up by 10 ish. provided i don't screw things up la kan..  " Aku terima nikah Tok Kadi.. oops tok kadi.. " Aku terima nikah Jennifer Garner.. oops wrong girl "Aku terima nikah.. hmm what la&nbsp;her name again..  well its all good kidding around here but hopefully i won't fakap la nanti.  "Aku terima nikah Syazrin Eliza bt Yazid dengan mas kahwinnya 80 ringgit tunai" had some time to practice la katakan.  then when the saksi kata sah (hmm the anticipation is killing me) begins my journey into the world of marriage..(another one bites the dust.. eh guys)  well thats not the main story la.. i can talk about that when its done and dusted. right now ckap banyak pun tak guna eh.  maybe i can talk about how me and syaze hooked up? hehe that might provide interesting reading.. for me la kot to reminisce. but wud probably bore the death outta u random readers out there.. hehehe anyways here's the summarized version.  1998 - Just got dumped by girlfriend. Vowed to stay celibate until Siti Nurhaliza comes meminang. Decided after spending best part of adult life constantly in some sort of relationship or the other, now is the time to concentrate on studies. Got a place at Lancaster University ( since LSE rejected me and they kept my housing deposit.. those buggers :( ). will go there in September.  Sept 23 (or was it 26) 1998 - Was waiting at KLIA for me flight, walking around the airport with me mom, saw this hot girl with her family. Thought to self "hmm mesti budak ni nak pegi UK jugak, i wonder if.. ferget it" Met friends at airport, Muz, Ariff, and some more can't remember and said girl was also there. was surprised that my friends know her but i didn't. then thought, must did her a-levels down south la kot, koz i'd remember the girl if she was in Scotland.  Sept 98 - arrived in London. found out said girl's name was syaze, and she's going to same university (thought "wey hey") they wanted to hire a van to go to lancaster 200 quid ( i think la) damn i said no way man.. lets take the train.. and i'll help carry ur stuff (there was a lot!) so took train to lancaster, me, muz, syaze, ernie, dollah and haza.. did i miss anyone? hehe but those were the main ones..  Midway to Lancaster - train broke down. 2 hours! (hehe lebeh kurang laa) tried to break the ice by cracking up jokes and all that but it was a harsh crowd ( later was told that syaze thought i was kinda weird, heheh)  Sept 98 - Arrived in lancaster and university life began..   damn this is taking so long...  cutting the story short, by the 15th of November 1998. me and syaze hooked up.       White day in Lancaster..      heheh what happens in between is for another entry okay..  &nbsp;

            Who am I?..      all ur life u believe u really know who u really are. u live by ur set principles and u stand by them. sure there are times u bend the rules but generally u always toe the line.  but what if suddenly u realise that all this while ur living a lie. conforming to everyone elses notion of norm and reality. not even realizing what you really want. why ur really here..  when u do realize, is it too late? can u change a lifetime's worth of fallacy? or do u even bother to change? since everything is accepted as it is, is it really a lie? what is truth anyways? it is more of perception rather than actual facts.. so if everyone tells u its true.. why are u challenging it?  why do we even bother..

      there is positively too much porn  on the net..  thats like the understatement of the year. well since we do exercise a degree of control over what and where we go online. its a matter of exercising our choice. if u don't like porn don't go look for it. don't be all searching for it and then say there's too much porn and suggest "lets all ban the internet".  anyways what got me started about this whole thing was when i was watching NTV 7 rejigged news program. the main headline was how young girls are being mislead on the internet. of how older men posing as younger guys are setting up dates with these girls and are taking advantage of the whole thing. the reporter than proceded to demonstrate how easy it was for girls to be approached by this men asking for sexual favors. i was thinking, wait a minute, that's not how it goes.        One of the many spots..      the thing is, the reporter went to a sex or "adult" chat room. u go to these rooms not to find company or someone to talk to. u go there because ur horny little mind wants to go there so u can work out ur issues or what not. but the report portrayed it as if if u go on IRC nowadays ur susceptible to be approached by random strangers with offers of random sex. thats not right. it is true that while the IRC/chat/IMs and all that has become a popular medium for paedophiles to do their thing but it still has certain element of user control.  for example if i was approached by some stranger saying if i want to see his 12 inch schwang (virtual guide to schwang sizes is u minus 6" for actual size), clearly that is not my scene so i should just put the little bugger on ignore. seriously, if u go to these places/chatrooms and all that, u need to bear in mind that not everything is what it seems and u should exercise some common sense and control.   well, i think instead of the report showing how easy it was to be approched by sleazebuckets in a sex chat room. it should emphasize educating these possible victims on ways of detecting that ur online buddies are not who they say they are. here's some easy tips:  1) If the picture they send u has a striking resemblance to Allesandro Nesta than it probably is Allesandro Nesta - (have keena to thanks for this) anyone can send u any picture and claim it is them. if i put a pic of Brad Pit on me blog and say it was me.. would anyone buy it? hehe same with ircs, IM's and all the lot.. dont be so gullible.. 2) If they send u dirty emails/pics and all that - simply ignore and dont open them lest you might be tempted.. or even worse might also have viruses. u get them Bots in chat rooms posting links to websites with pics on it, the file name says jpg but cleverly hidden is jpg.exe with the exe in white colored font the same as ur background so u cant see it. probably a virus or some spyware installer. 3) NEVER i repeat NEVER agree to meet them alone.. well if u insist on it ALWAYS pick public places - in the first place i'll advice against physical meetings, but hey if u reaaly need to see that ur Brad Pit lookalike e-pal really looks like Homer Simpson than be my guest, but make sure safety is always first. 4) Well what else is there? i can't think of anything else at the moment.. 5) If ur one of those peeps who goes to sex chatrooms looking for sex, then same rules still applies, and the final word is NO still means NO. if u've set the date, but decides to change ur mind, it doesnt give the dude a reason to still go ahead and rape you. NO means NO, so guys DON'T! STOP" means STOP not Don't stop as in go on..  anyways, when we are online chatting, surfing and all that, we need to remember that there's a lot of crap going around and also there's loadsa useful stuff too. Don't be painting everything with the same brush eh. U know how i hate to generalize...

            Old and new..       I picked up my new identification card, the fancy hi tech MyKad. Preloaded with multiple functions and all that jazz. Anyways, took me close to an hour of waiting for the card. Still think the functions on it is kinda overkill, but hey maybe it'll prove me wrong. Its kinda cool, the whole idea of just bringing one card for all your "card"y functions, ATM, Touch'n'Go etc. But imagine losing it and the hassle it'll cause you with all of the functions it has stored on it.

      Well since high school, i've been through a lot of phases. There's the "I wanna be white boy rapper vanilla ice" phase, where me and a bunch of friends would sit at the back of the class, rapping to the Iceman and seeing who could memorize the lyrics better. I remembered i could rhyme the whole ice-ice baby song (even did a malay variant with Ais-Ais kacang) That set the scene where every thing i did was rap influenced.   I did my notes in rap, hehe even did poetry in rap. Heheh little did i know that all of that was crap..  Then along the way i was introduced to the grunge sound of Nirvana. My brother borrowed a cassete (no cd's that time, couldn't afford one) from his friend. Had this cute baby chasing a dollar bill underwater on its cover. I was curious. Cranked it up and the rest was history.  Nevermind changed me.   That's when this whole idea of being a rock star came in.  I was 14 when i start dabbling in writing lyrics for fun. My best friend Ahmad is wicked on the guitar. And sometimes he would play some random tune and i'd fill in the words. Many a song we did during those days. Heheh chill out songs, songs to pick chicks, motivational songs (we practiced this one tune because our teacher wanted some sort of presentation for the evenings assembly, we got the tune done only for her to cancel our gig and replace it with a friend giving a "pidato"), the theme song for Prefects, etc etc. Those were the days.  Well the idea for a band came about i think in one of our random outings to KL maybe it was Central market? I cant remember. Me and Ahmad and Azlan was toying with the idea of having a band. Heheh but more of a joking sense la. I'd play the recorder, ahmad plays the castanet and Azlan the kerincing (what is it called in english?) hehe we would do the theme song for this Milo ad. Our hit single was going to be a tune called Ole, we laughed about this for like till now i think. Even named the band Redox. Hahah my late sister (Allah bless her soul) was supposed to be our manager coz she had the contacts. But dreams are just dreams eh.        Best buds for life..       Anyways now i only write lyrics once in a blue moon. Maybe the last one i did was a song that i wrote for Syaz,which was ages ago, hehe promised i write her a song during our initial courtship back in 98, and i only finished it before we graduated in 2001. Had help from ahmad to spice it up a bit. We had a recording session in Warwick coz ahmad got this 4 track portastudio and we had a blast recording some funky tunes. Still have the minidisc with the songs, maybe i can put it up on the net if ya'll curious to listen to it.  Well nowadays with the so many reality shows showcasing normal everyday joes trying to make it big, becoming postars, idols, topstars and academy graduates, i wonder what would happen if i decided to follow my dream.. heheh well probably just become a number in a statistic of those wannabe's that didn't make it big kot.. hehe but then again u never know right..

      I was watching this episode of Law and Order: Special Victims Unit. About this mom who was homeschooling her kids. She didn't trust the schooling system and she was paranoid about the safety of her two kids. She filled them with crazy ideas of how dangerous it is life in the outside world. How the only way for her children to be safe was to listen to everything she says. Its somewhat borderline abusive the way she's treating her kids. Anyways cutting it short one of the boys felt he had enough and ran away to the cops. The cops came down hard on her but they couldn't prove anything.   The mom than felt that her family was threaten and the welfare people are going to come and break up her family taking them away from her to live in foster care or something like that. Anyways she filled her sons head with how children in foster care are going to be raped and sodomized and suffer a fate worst than death. She's been in control of everything the children do and learn. After saying all that, she left a gun on the table and told her older son that if he knows whats right for him he'd know what to do.  The mom was willing to let her son kill themselves than seeing the family broken up.   I was watching this and thought wtf is wrong with this picture? How can a mother with her natural instincts of protecting her children become so derailed? Better to have the children dead than seeing them taken away? Its like telling someone i dont wanna hurt your feelings and then saying that we're breaking up coz i love ur best friend. Heheh well that didn't happen to me la of course but hey its along the context of this entry la kan.  Anyways when does fear for your children's safety cross into obsessive paranoia?   Lets say that statistics say that kids get hurt playing in the playground, when do we stop accompanying them to play and start not letting them go out? When do we start not letting them eat "jajan" for the fear of carcinogenic substances in junk food? When do we start not letting them have friends for the fear of the bad influences other people may have on them?  The point is, we need to protect our children, true enough. But we need to do it in a way that does not bring them harm in the long run. Imagine a child living in an environment so closed that there's no actual contact with anyone, everything he learns is controlled by one person, how'd he fend for himself if he's ever to live in the ouside world when he grows up?  Anyways, i just felt like writing this coz of that tv show. Maybe its just tv it aint real. But imagine if it does happen? Man its a strange world we live in here..

      Well i was out with my sister shopping for some wedding stuff when she decided to go and meet a friend at Starbucks. A nice enough fella, quite opinionated. Heheh she told him that i was getting married and he replied, "Why? (in a boy ur making a big mistake kinda voice)" I said its just a natural progression, u move on from one stage of the relationship to another, well complicated version. I asked is he married? Is he speaking from experience? Well of course he said no? Ahh then it dawned on me, the single people know it all syndrome.  When it comes to giving advice on relationships, it is always the single people who are always like telling you oh you have to do this no you can't do that. If they are like so good at relationships ever wonder why they are still single? I know this is somewhat generalizing (and those of u would know that i DON'T like to generalize), but hey for the sake of argument lets just assume its true :).  Single people tend to have a negative view on long term commitments (hence the reason why they are still single). They can't imagine the possibility that two individuals may be content in living their lives with each other. How this is so like impossible. With potentially a number of other single people out there waiting to be acquainted with, how can u be sure that the one ur with now is the one eh?  Can u be sure that the choice u make is the best one or are u just settling for the next best thing.   Anyways one would argue that single people are divided into 3 catagories. 1) I choose to be single, 2) I'm in between relationship and 3) I haven't found the right one. Well my advice to number 1 is.. ur missing a lot. Number 2) and 3) still got the chance. The right person is still waiting to be found.. hehe aa enuff of that..

      I'm a big Stephen King fan. I have to admit he's the only author i've gladly part my money with. He's style of writing and the way he grips the readers attention really captures the imagination.  This particular series, the dark tower series have been described as King's greatest work. Spanning over 7 books with linking/emerging stories in some of his other works.  I've finished reading the latest book, the Song of Susannah, and i wonder where the man gets his ideas. Anyways, i urged those who love sories of adventures, quests and the fight between good and evil to pick this one up.   Currently i'm patiently waiting for the last installment. Kinda sad to see that the adventures of Roland and his Ka-Tet are coming to a close. Feel a little sense of dread, like i'm fearing for the fates of these characters, the fate of Susannah, the split personality wife of Eddie Dean, the recovering junkie and keymaker extraordinaire, of Jake and the billy bumbler Oy and of Pere Callahan.  Sometimes u get stories that really grips u, stories that puts u smack dab in the middle of whats happening. Till u feel some sort of connection to the characters. Well this one did it for me..        The final book..

            We are the champions..      Having made their way into the finals of Euro 04 and playing infront of a pack home crowd, one would think that Portugal had a clear advantage over their opponents Greece. However the greeks played together defensively as a unit and proved impregnable for the Portuguese.   Then it happened. In the 57th minute Angelos Charisteas took his chance with a header and the rest is all history. Portugal never did overcame the deficit and was clearly not producing their best performance shown recently against England and Holland.  Well its a weekend full of upsets. Maria Sharapova beat Serena Williams for the ladies title at wimbledon. Rossi and Gibernau crashed out of the Brazilian Moto GP. Hehe only Schumacher proving that all is RED in the F1 scene. Edging out Alonso and Barichello in the French Grand Prix. making it 9 outta 10 wins for Schumi..  Anyways its all about the Greeks today. Congratulations to the team for a job well done..

      Okay how ironic is this, the opening match and the closing match of Euro 2004 will be played by the same teams. Hehehe after clinching semi-finals victory against top favorites the Czechs, the unfancied Greek minnows are causing a stir amongst all footie fans. Maybe its the year of the upset.. what bigger upset than to beat the host nation in the biggest finals for both countries.. hehehe

       Have recently finished:    Splinter Cell 2: Pandora Tomorrow   - A cracking game, fans of the action stealth genre rejoice. This further improves from the first game and is a lot more. Unfortunately haven't been able to test the multiplayer game mode due to not having a network adapter thingy :(    Currently playing:    Psy-Ops: The Mindgate Conspiracy   - Again an action 3rd person shooter but with an added twist of psychic powers to help advance the cause. Decent plot and all that i think i'm 25 % through. So far everything has been cool. Only prob is the lack of weapons that u can carry. U have to switch between rifles, shotgun, machine gun by literally dropping it to the ground. More realistic i guess. Overall nice game..    Front Mission 4   - Tactical turn based strategy cum RPGish number. Promises hours of gameplay. Have burnt close to 6 hours already. Hehehe this one will definitely keep me awake at night. While waiting for footie that is.. Customizations of wanzers, pilot abilities, cool trick with the linking abilities.. FM fans need to play this one..   coming up: List of all completed games (well the more notable ones lah)

      Saw Spidey 2 yesterday. Btw it rocks. Its like an emotional rollercoaster ride filled with touching scenes and fast paced frenetic action.  Want me to spoil it for those who haven't seen it? Nah on second thought go see it for yourself. Parker finally got lucky eh. I'm sure spidey 3 is already in the pipeline.. can't wait..

        Sekuntum mawar merah, mekar di taman, nirwana..   Bagai di ibaratkan, mekar mewangi, sebuah nilai cinta..   Aku, bagaikan dalam gelora,   Bahtera cinta karam di rimba,    Engkau menantikan wira,   Menyelamatkan dirimu yang kecewa,    Cintaku, hanyalah padamu,   Kasihku hanyalah untukmu,   Kuharapkan cinta darimu,   Di hatiku hanyalah dirimu,    Dahagalah,   Hatiku, tanpa kasihmu..

      okay two nuns walk into a bar...  well thats a lame way to start eh. well as i sit here in front of my pc, sipping a cuppa tea, looking outside thw window, with a view overlooking the city, i can't help but wonder how everything seems to fall into place and at the same time things are not actually all fine and dandy.  cases in point;  1) Arsenal's convincing win over Utd in the Community Shield - Despite the 3 - 1 win, hangs the looming shadow of the prospect of life without the influential skipper Paddy Vieira.  2) MRR 2  - whose to blame for all the cracks appearing in the structure?  3) Tough stance on illegal immigrants - its all fine on paper but what about the implementation?  4) National youth development plan - addressing the root cause or just giving us a quick one for the media?   Sometimes we need to examine things with a fine tooth comb. don't accept everything as correct and true. put some thought into it and then form ur views and opinion. make a stand..

      i think a guy died on my way to the office today. i was in a cab i saw this man lying on the road. the police were minding the traffic while some people were attending to the dude. i hope he's okay tho. but it doesn't look promising.  anyways, did i mention syaz was away in seremban for the past two days?   on a brighter note i saw I,Robot yesterday night. it's a nice paced action movie that somehow manages to reignite my interest in artificial intelligence and the progression and evolution of logical thought. (heheh macam bagus aje bunyinye)  i wanted to see the house of flying daggers. but forgotten that i promised syaz we go see that when she's free. well I,Robot was okay. no regrets la about it. me and ahmad saw it after that had an interesting conversation on the logic behind the premise of the movie. heheh blah di blah di blah later.. went home and had a game of ping-pong. was crap upon by my brother ijai who's spinning game left me outta sorts.  did i mention syaz was away in seremban for the past two days? oh i already did eh..  hehe relax acat, she's coming home today...

      well while i was driving back from penang with syaz on saturday, having been to her sister's convo at usm, we passed a very significant moment that can only happen once.. for her car that is. yep, it has reached that 100000 km mark. imagine when syaz started using the car back in 2001 it only displayed like 15000 km on the meter.. heheh 85000 km in like close to 4 yrs. thats like pergi balik london 4 kali eh.. hehe        99999..             100000..

      well i'm spent the weekend at my parents house. well the wife was away to seremban, outstation, will only be seeing her come tuesday. better for me to come to work from KL rather than all the way from Klang. heheh not to be a softie, but i must admit that i miss her laa.. (awwww... yeah yeah.. i know..)  anyways, got into an argument with me sister. she wants to go to pendang, kedah. just her and a friend. they wanna drive there together. my sister can't drive so i said laa, take la public transport. she insisted that it was more convenient to drive there. well in my mind la.. two young girls in a car all alone driving to pendang is not such a good scenario to be in. i'm just concerned of her safety aje. but typical rebellious teenager type never listens. i dunno if she's going to go thru with it or not. my parents also not so hot with the whole idea. anyways this is just one of the stuff that's been happening.  since she's enjoyed that little bit of independence having gone to college and all that, she's becoming more and more wanting to have her own way kinda attitude. insensitive to her parents feelings and sometimes just being plain old irritating. i'm not just singling out my sister here but i think this happens to a lot of us out there as well.  when we grow older, we tend to believe that we should be entrusted to make our own mind. make decisions, do this do that. but having this ability doesn't mean that we can disregard the views and opinions of others.   hehe, anyways, i still love my sister no matter what. so i'm gonna talk to her some more la when i get home.. abang garang la katakan...

      Yestersay's community shield match between the gunners and man u displayed all the traits of a classic arsenal/man u encounter, albeit no on was sent off despite tempers flaring up during the match. Jose Antonio Reyes showed us why Arsene Wenger splashed so much to obtain his services.  Anyways, can't put too much into this result. i'm holding my predictions till after the Man U v Chelsea match this this coming sunday..  Go the Gunners..        Image from 4thegame.com

      i switched on the telly yesterday and saw the finale of the race to the altar. for the record, that was the first time i saw the program and seeing the ending was only fitting since i also was recently married eh. the winner of the race got their dream wedding ceremony organized by some dude with a very thick accent. maybe english, sounds like he got something stuck in his throught tho.  anyways, the wedding was a grand three-part affair, with all the fancy decor, etc etc. but the thing that touched me the most about the whole thing was when the couple susan and coyt exchanged their vows. it was clear that the two were deeply in love with eachother. u can tell it by the way they look into eachother's eyes. how both of them professed undying love and devotion. one can only be so lucky.  it is one thing to know that someone loves u, and another to hear them say it. its also another thing to know that someone doesn't love u when ur heart is already devoted to them. in anycase, the heart is a very fragile thing. it can easily be broken and once broken it never completely heals.   so rejoice, oh those who have found true love and to those still searching.. that someone is there waiting to be found..

      well i'm destined to come early to the office. after half a year of closely shaving it, coming in at 9:00 am, i now find the prospect of coming early to the office very "interesting". well since every one else won't be in till at least 8:30, leaving the whole dept to myself if i come in at 7:30 eh.  anyways, this whole marriage life has not rubbed on me totally yet. need to really get use to waking up next to syaz and have the strength to get out of bed. well she is helping tho, by having me set the alarm on my palm (my brand new zire 72! thanks syaz) and placing it across the room so that i HAVE to get up and switch it off.  in anycase i take it as a challenge. i'm not one to go into things halfheartedly (well that short stint at the gym? picking up a foreign language?), marriage is something that should not be taken lightly. we need to put in 110% to really make it work. but we do get back what we put in eh. and the returns are worth it.        Nervous dude waiting for the big moment..
