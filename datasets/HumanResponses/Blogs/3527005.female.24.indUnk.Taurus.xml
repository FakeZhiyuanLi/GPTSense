      Ray told me again I am smoking again way too much.  It's because I am stressed something is going to go wrong with my move.  For some reason I feel as if it's going to be to true.  I really hope everything goes smooth.  My check this week is actually really great, now if I can just double it, I will breath a sigh of relief and quit smoking again.  Well...at least when I am not drinking.    I really hope that Elisha gets to come out tonight.  I think it will do her some good to blow off some stress.  Plus now that I have been promised the ultimate black coat, I can't wait (sorry Elisha) hidden agenda (just kidding).   I can't wait to get my car back this weekend, it's been way to long without my T-Tops.  I really want to go for a drive this weekend and have some fun.  I think I am going to have to leave work at 4:00 in order to get a nap since it will be a late night tonight.  I am craving Heros and Legends  and I really want to go to VooDoo.  Then I can crash into bed happily tonight next to Ray and cuddle.    What more can I ask for?

      Last night, I went to the baseball game. I did enjoy being with the girls.  I love taking care of them.    He says that I always act uncomfortable around him on the phone, he's right.  I feel as if he is always acting as if I am doing something wrong.  I feel as if I could look at him in the wrong direction and he will be mad.  I got off of the phone earlier since he walked outside, thinking he was going to come over to say hello or that he loved me.  Instead the dog was more important.    My other reason for getting off of the phone was to talk to Karen about my new bid, I needed to get some information from her.  He automatically thought it was a bad thing.  I don't know if I can handle this negative attitude from him.  I love him more than he will ever know but I feel as if I am just waiting for the other shoe to drop.  I don't feel as if we are being us with each other anymore.  I love him but can it work? I hope so, to the extent it hurts but I don't know if the first six months were too damaging.  Even though we talk more freely now then ever I feel as if it's still not us talking.  I feel as if it's the polite version of us.  I like that version but I don't know anymore if it's real.  For some reason when I wake up next to him, I feel overwhelming joy, love and panic all at the same time.  The panic is from the last six months and the joy and love is from the here and now.  Or is this all just me being scared.  In my heart I know that I have a true love for him, something I have never felt before.  Only Hunter has to share that place.  I am so afraid to let that show, I still feel as if the minute it does I will have my heart broke.  I am going to register for school and find a second job where does that leave anytime for Hunter or Ray?  I have that panic feeling back that I had for months, I was so bad for the past couple of months that I felt that I could have broke into a million pieces, I have that feeling back again.  I hate that feeling.   Maybe through my writing I will reflect my answer.    I am looking forward to tomorrow, I really cannot get enough quality time with him.  I just want to have a good weekend.

      REG is pressuring me to give in and let go of my fears.  I feel as if the minute I do, he will get revenge on me for not being perfect. How quickly he forgets he pulled away and that's why I gave up.    I'm not willing to give up on that love, I feel as if that love is going to give up on us.  Stars of the Sea

      I just noticed that all of my titles are basically negative and I realized I only post when I feel overwhelmed.  So here's to another negative blogging day.  After what I went through with Ray last night I realize that there is no way I could be with him any longer. I cannot excuse behavior like his. I would laugh at any other woman if she was dealing with what I just went through.  All I asked of Steph and Ray was to back down and agree to disagree. But in the end only Steph would back down. In the end Ray was the asshole.  I really wish I never had to see him ever again. I would feel like he was truly dead to me. Right now I feel as if I am walking into a ghost.  Ray feels as if no one has had it as bad as he has well, sorry prick, everyone has their battlewounds.

      I am so tired right now, and I am getting bored again.  I am bored with life as it is right now, I guess I keep asking the question, Is this all there is?  I have a great house, career, the best 3 year old ever, why am I fighting it?  I still feel incomplete.

      This last month has been hectic. I knew that moving was a good idea and I am very happy about my home, it's the first time I feel like I have a home. I even enjoy having Steph stay with me.  The constant reminding her of pick up after herself gets old. I do love her very much and I am glad I will always feel like I was supportive when it was needed. Even though we are the only family that is supportive for each other, I would still be there for anyone else in our family that needed that love.  Almost all unpack, still see a few lingering boxes. I am getting upset that I haven't gotten to painting yet. Even if it's one coat in the bathroom this week, I will paint some walls this weekend.  The bathroom is going to be two shades of camel. With black and white photography and a gentle old washed look. I may end up applying the same technique I am going to do in the bedroom of an aged wall look. I really want to buy a new bed and bedding. Like the new headboard idea and I can't wait to complete it. There is just too much to do all at once.  I am glad I didn't start the red in the living room before now. I know that is a smart move since the owner is stopping by this week to look at my bedroom floor, I will be very happy when that is fixed.  I am going to have to stay somewhere else when it's being fixed since I cannot get into the bathroom without walking over that area.  I have to start looking for gallery shelves for the living room and new wallpaper for the kitchen. I think if I can complete a couple of my projects I can then concentrate on projects with Hunter. I think we are going to work on her Noah's Ark first, she really was upset to discover that it didn't come with any paint. I have to take her to Michaels on Sunday to get her paint. I have a feeling it's going to end up an expensive project.  I am in a mood to start my art again, I want to work on a new art project but I will never have the time right now. I really want to start another shadow picture. I love how the picture of Hunter turned out. I think I am going to use the picture of Steph from Long Grove. I love it, I think it will make a great addition to the gallery.  I am very glad I get to come in late tomorrow morning, I really need time to finish some projects and spend some time with Hunter. I think we are going to have to cuddle on the couch and watch a movie. I think I am going to be staying up late to get some more projects marked off of the To Do List.  First on List-Paint Hunter's bookcase, Finish moving the furniture in the porch, Paint over the Dog Border in Porch, Finish putting clothes away and dished put away.  How fun, somehow I will take a break to work on Art with Hunter.  Back to work.
