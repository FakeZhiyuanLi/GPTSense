      jill, my best friend since the beginning of 7th grade to i think the present. the reason i am writing this blog is that i feel like the biggest jerk in the world for being mean to you and eric. i should have kept my mouth shut. so lets just try to put this stuff in the past......... like it is now sorta.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  now in jills blog she had many paragraphs on random topics. THEY ARENT BORING!!!!!! well to us fellow random people. like me and you and other people yay! right now i am trying to think of random topics. first thought is........ why arent there any wendys commercials??? wendys is the bomb. it rules!!!!! try their salads!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  i dont think i should have started the blog out like that so im going to talk about happy things. like when jill and i were locker neighbors in school last year. every morning we would see eachother and talk about stuff. yay for stuff. but every morning good or bad i knew jill would be right there to brighten it up. thanx for bein there jill! &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  well jill and i guess whoever else reads my blogs............ just remember the good times............. by the way jill, i would so invite you to my party.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  seriously,  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Jason M. Bush

      hello and welcome! i trust that you have never read any of my previous blogs and are just a random blog surfer. or maybe you are one of my friends reading my blogs cause you have nothing better to do! yay for my friends that have nothing better to do than sit around and read my blogs! to think of it i am probably righting these for nothing because nobody just goes on their computer and thinks "lets look at bushs blogs!" but anyway.......   today was a good day. i had over jon aubin and it was a party sorta not really. but most of you already know that because you are so cool and read my other blogs. ô_ô we had lots of fun playing video games on my pimpin platinum gamecube. we also watched my special 7 disk complete set of family guy which gave us a few laughs.we watched three episodes and they were HILARIOUS! HAHAHA not that funny but they were great.   by the way, most of you are probably wondering why is my title join blog? well the reason my title is join blog is because you guys should join blog! you know the ones who havent..... joined.........yet. ya!   soooooooooo     ya      bored       bvg     sorry, i got tired and my head fell on the keyboard. so i think this is it for me for now. got to do that damn summer reading. for all the people wondering i am reading after and amyrrillis or however you spell it. see ya!    bushy

      hey peoples. here with my pal jon aubin eating a mini microwavable pizza. silly jon didnt want any.its combination so it has sausage and stuff. it takes 3:10 to make. jon is pacing my basement as i write this blog at 1:38pm on july 13. he is thinking about how a tiny fan can create a wind stong enough to make a breeze. by the way its the fan in my basement. right now i am listening to one winged angel the song which is a song from final fantasy 7. great game.   as i said last night futurama was on. i watched and it was when fry, a man who was flung 2000 years into the future, trying to play the holophone. that is an instument that projects an image when you play certain notes. but it was pretty funny. then after that i watched aqua teen hunger force. for those of you who actually read these things you would know it was 12 midnight then. athf is 15 minutes long and then after that i went to bed.   so now i am boring jon and i think we should do stuff so were gonna play a game or sumtin. maybe watch family guy. but anyway the pizza was good. now a random saying from jon.   jon: hippos ate my cheese crackers you fool!!!!!!!!   that was jon everyone. pure genius. so ill see ya later. read me later!    bushay

      i am writing my second blog which was 47 min. after my first blog. this whole thing is bloggin blog. not really, this is cool. its like an internet journal thing. i started a journal, wrote in it for four entries and thought it was boring but this is more fun. its all cool. like me.........................i wish ô_ô   for those of you who havent figured it out yet or are too lazy to figure it out like me it was 10:57 when i wrote this. which means with the new adult swim schedule on cartonn network that can only mean family guy is starting. it is the one where peter becomes the head executive of a cigarette company. one of the great lines from that episode is........ the son chris and peter are on a boat and they spot a whale.  chris: dad, what is the blowhole for? peter: well, ill tell you what its not for son. and thats why i can never go back to sea world.   that is what i would be like. gettin kicked out of sea world and things like that.by the way, after that is futurama. great show.  so this is my second blog. i said that already didnt i? *scrolls to top* ya i did. thats what it is about me, i forget things. im uhhhh whats the word im looking for................. forgetful! thats a bad thing aint it? well ill leave you to decide.  friends section now. i bet u can guess why i am not putting any right now. you guessed i think. did you? huh huh did you? well its because im lazy thank you very much.  what else is there now? not much. i am a simple person. i aint that smart and sometimes i can be a jerk but somehow all you guys and gals at school put up with me. all i have to say to that is thanks. o and ladies, by the way, im single. ô_ô   so until i talk to you again,   whatever name you chose last time.

      well hello whomever dares to enter the realm of bush or bushy or the bushanater or bushay or santa or bushwacker or bushizzle or bushazzle or bushnizzle or bushnazzle or ahhhh who cares! pick one! odly enough it is 10:10pm on july 12 and this is my very first blog!!! yay! i guess. but anyway i read jills and figured looks like fun. got nothin better to do. so i wrote this blog as you can see right now or maybe you got sick of all the names and just exited by now. i dont know and i dont care. so anyway i sit here in front of me while my sister erin plays need for speed underground on my pimpin platinum gamecube. looks like fun but im too lazy to kick her off. thats my blog for now i guess. or maybe theres more....... you can probably see it anyway.   to my few friends who i dont feel like listing right now. but i do have one thing to do and that is to apologize to eric for me being a jerk about crap. so eric im sorry.   well havent left yet? KOOL! well if i had something where you could sign it proving you read all this boring crap i would have one wouldnt i? but one of my favorite shows is family guy. my favorite characters are peter stewie and brian. if you can get half the jokes brian and stewie make they are the best. but nothing beats the alcohol endused stupidity of peter. these lines prove he loves alcohol and his family. this is while trying to pottie train stewie.   stewie: i dont have to go right now. peter: i should give you a beer, itl go straight through ya. stewie: o yes, then we can go in the back n light up a dubbie and watch porn.   now if u have never seen family you are a loser just kidding but if you have never seen it stewie is around two years old and is the smartest of the family. also, brian is the dog and yes he does talk.   well, now that i have spilt my thoughts and a few family guy lines in there i think i am through. so until we meet again sorta not really. so bye     insert whatever name from the top you like
