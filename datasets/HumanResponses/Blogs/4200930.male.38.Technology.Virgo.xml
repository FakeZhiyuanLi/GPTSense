      What a complete daze today has been. Catching up with friends and family, all of them congratulating me on the amazing wins this week have brought me.  I put the wins down to hard work and a very lucky dog! And of course my long suffering other half, Beth, without whom none of this would be worthwhile.  Didn’t sleep very well last night – too hyped up over the win, and awoke this morning at 6am ready to go straight away! Usually it takes an hour or so to get ‘with it’ first thing but it was like I pinged straight awake!  After shopping today I went straight around to the local ‘comping club’ and swapped entry forms and we did the ritual creep around the table to see what had been won etc? No one could believe my luck and requested I leave some prizes for them next month!  Of course I’m ‘paying’ the lucky dog back in treats, purchased today a very large bag of doggy biscuits to keep the dog happy.  What a great time this is, the memories may fade but at least I felt like a lottery winner for a time.

      What a win!!!!!  I've still not calmed down as we say in Liverpool - I'm just a bit hyped up you might say. I have just been checking out the hotel it looks fantastic - the Beverley Wiltshire Hotel on Rodeo drive (or something like that) I'm looking forward to the long haul flight (hopefully in a 747 - yes I'm a plane fan!!!!!) - and the VIP behind the scenes visit to Paramount (my fav show STAR TREK is made there!).  I'd been trying to calm myself down all day and saying I've already won a great prize and not to get down if I didn't win the draw (which I thought it was going to be). I've been on edge all day looking at our wedding venue in Liverpool (the Palm House in Sefton Park - its lovely). Then at 16:45 I get a call saying be prepared for 'battle' at around 17:30 and they would get all the weeks winners on air to guess an 'amount' and nearest would win.  No call at 17:30, I'm getting increasingly more nervous, then I get called at 17:45 and we start after the track has finished. I'm bricking it BIG style!!!!! getting more nervous then the DJ asks 'How long on average each year do LA residents spend in traffic jams?' nearest wins!  First contestant says 700 odd hours, next person says 600 odd, I'm next and all through I was thinking 150 odd hours, but after hearing the rest, I think, god I must be really under estimating and in America they do commute further! So I go for 500 hours. The person after me then says 800 I think.  The DJ then does the old dramatic pause and says Phil's the lowest with 500 and the answer is 150 (or was it 120) - Phil's the nearest - and I nearly faint with shock. I was with Beth's family at the time we all nearly had heart attacks, the memory of that moment will last forever.   Fantastic! a Holiday in LA in a 5 star hotel, Mini for the week and well great really, words fail me. I was in tears and quite choked.  This win has got to be the best so far!  Good luck all

      What a week this is proving to be. I just can’t believe it!  I’ve just won £500 on a C5 show called Memory Bank. I’ve won on this show before earlier in the year and just by luck was entering today and only got 6 out of 50 successful entries in when I got the ‘call-back’. Its just incredible what can be waiting just around the corner for you when Lady Luck smiles at you! I thought WOW that I had won some envelopes first thing this morning but this caps it off just nicely; just need tomorrows win to come in now.  It was only the week before last I was thinking that the month of August for wins was a bit of a wash out; it may have got off to a late start but boy is it coming up trumps now!  Thank you oh great god of comping

      What a difference a day makes!  I've been able to gloat about my win around work and really piss off all the petrol heads around in their fast cars! I even accepted the job I was offered but I still remain highly sceptical about it; put it this way if I don't like it or feel I'm being set-up I'm off. Also if told to be a 'gate keepr' role I'll do just that and expect to be backed up when people try to 'go around the side door' etc and not use procedures!  Keep the faith and keep comping

      After trying for what seems years to get through to a competition on Virgin Radio - I did it!  Mind you it was a trial, the DJ went to line 5, not me; I thought they'll get the answer right, but no they couldn't hear them so they came to me. My big chance but they couldn't hear me either! Bugger I thought my chance up in smoke. The DJ soon realised they had a problem and played a record while they sorted out the technical difficulties!  Anyway problem solved, they went back to the man on line 5, he had to work out from a girl speaking a load of Italian what job she did. All I could make out was the word sex or sexy, which I'm guessing is the same the world over!  The choices were a-Gymnast, b-Fashion Model or c-Barmaid  The chap on line 5 went for fashion model - if I'd have been first I might have said the same thing. He was wrong so they came to me next and I went with my gut feeling of Barmaid and the rest as they say is history.  What did I win, well its a weekends driving experience for 2 with £150 spends; driving new & old Mini's, learning how to handle them around a race track and includes driving E-type jags and a big red 52 seater buses! I'm also in the draw on Friday for a VIP trip to LA. Wish me luck!    Isn't comping just great.

      I thought earlier, ‘What’s with all the kids nowadays wearing baseball caps?’  You know the sort, Addidas, Nike, Burrberry, and the like, along with their tracksuits or heaven forbid striped jumpers and trousers tucked into their white sports socks. Talk about overpriced so-called ‘designer’ tat!  I’m told by much younger people that this is supposed to look trendy and ‘with it’. In my opinion it looks neither! This is just another example of how the very fabric of our society is being eaten away by ‘yob culture’. If you told these people to wear a uniform they would say they are being oppressed, however by dressing the same are they not also wearing a uniform? Why on earth they would want to dress in the way they do beats me.  The very same youngsters (because not all of them are like this, just the lot that you see around the streets) behave in an appalling manner and always appear in ‘gangs’. I wonder if the baseball caps are to disguise them from the CCTV cameras? It’s funny, as all the kids you see in the local paper with Anti-Social Behaviour Orders against them all wear baseball caps!  Why the need for the designer labels, its not something I craved whilst a teenager in the 80’s and that was a ‘have now’ society. Do we as parents give our kids these things to make up for our own lack of spending quality time with the kids and expect money to be the answer.  Perhaps we are now reaping what we have sown all these years by letting the ‘little’ things slide so in the end society collapses in on itself as it reaches critical mass.    Beware the big bang!

      Dilemma, what do you do when you have been offered a new role and don’t particularly fancy it? Should I do it or hold out for something else? Or, and it is a distinct possibility that the next job offer I might not be in a position to turn down!  I could be being paranoid but I have a feeling that the job offer has strings attached or even worse a hidden agenda, i.e. being set-up to fail. I wouldn’t mind but two previous offers of new roles appear to have fallen though. I would have liked either of those and I’m starting to worry that I’m being ‘manoeuvred’ out on my arse! (I had set my little heart on doing the either a web type development role, or the team leader of our software environment team).  Looks like I might have to start looking else where for a job! Probably get better paid to, as the I.T. industry has never rewarded loyalty! – I didn’t even get a bonus in my last role even though Testing delivered more than its contracted through put.   Isn’t life a bummer sometimes?

       Well surprise, surprise a recent survey in this country has pointed out the obvious yet again!  That ‘children’ are staying with their parents and being supported by them for longer. Way to go brainiacs surely that survey cost thousands and netted a nice profit for the survey company.  It’s painfully obvious why this state of affairs should come to pass if the Government just sat down and thought about it. But would they worry their tiny heads about it – clue: your probably sat on your head right now Tony! Your lot talk out of it enough!  Lets examine the facts:  No grants for students, they have to pay fees  Housing costs are really high, with runaway house prices and rents.  Low paid jobs, employers keeping costs down and paying ‘piss poor’ wages  This service culture we seem to have and no manufacturing industry, with call centres being the modern day equivalent of the mill.   So before more politicians start off on ‘kids’ staying at home and being ‘lazy’ etc can they just for one moment look at what’s happening and then make judgements rather than just making an un-educated guess. I will however agree that the society in which we live has ‘forced’ many kids and young adults into not expecting much from their lives.  Employers have a duty also to ensure that people are paid well so that they can contribute to society and consume the goods and services, which sustains the economy. It appears the only well paid people in many companies are the senior managers, if you rise through the ranks, certainly the company I work for just takes the piss with your wages.  A little tip for the Government: Rising costs are also why the population is decreasing in this country as both parties are required to go to work in order to keep the mortgage paid along with ever increasing household bills.  Talk about RIP OFF BRITAIN, why on earth asylum seekers want to come and live here beats me. Oh sorry I forgot I’m paying for them with my taxes and we do live in a welfare state!!!!

      How can a government in this country (Great Britain) say that it has the ‘mandate’ of the people?  Complete bollocks is what I say, especially as the majority of people can no longer be arsed voting (me included). Always much better things to do like scratch my arse or watch TV or even surf the net.  I’m not sure of figures here but I’m sure the majority of people of voting age within this country didn’t even vote. The minority of the electorite votes the majority of our MP’s, Local Councillors, and MEP’s into office. I believe when percentages etc are quoted on TV they should give each area a turnout percentage, so people can quite clearly see what is happening in their area.  Why are people disillusioned with politics? Quite an easy answer I feel. Put quite simply we are NOT represented. When was the last time your MP voted with his constituent’s views rather than along party lines? Why do MP’s insist on taking the opposite view of the opposition party rather than going along common sense/ best interests of the country etc? They always manage to agree nice pay rises for themselves! This doesn’t even begin to mention the lies that are told to us by our Prime Minister and other cabinet members. Great war Tony, now that we are aware of the truth are you going to say sorry to Saddam and re-instate him. No, I thought not. (Personally I agreed with the war but not necessarily the application or tactics deployed).  Before the so-called Labour reforms the original members of the House of Lords didn’t have a political axe to grind. Now more and more business friends of Tony and other parties are purchasing peerages (sorry nominated by political parties) maybe they will go the same way.  Nu-Labour, stands for Nu-Fascism, Nu-Corruption and Nu-Taxes more like.

      Well we had a good day out in the lovely City of Chester, and what a bright hot day it was to. I was a bit worried that it would rain, but no, it kept off and proved to be much better weather than what we had left at home.  Parking is really handy in the town centre and quite good access for disabled buggies etc. We even managed to combine a bus and boat tour, which I can highly recommend, and saves money to. Just get your tickets either on the tour bus or boat.  Isn’t it strange the way yanks flock to these historic places, probably because they have no heritage of their own, serves them right for their war of independence, which, if I think on was just a bunch of colonial Brits against taxes (something which I’m sure we all have sympathy for!).  Maybe in order for the present government to sit up and ‘Listen’ to the people who elected them (more fool us!) we need some sort of new revolution, down with Immigration, NO to duty of fuel, and let us import as many cigs and booze as we like.  Oi Govt situp and listen to YOUR PEOPLE.

      Well the package was.........................................a surprise actually! It was a mug from an on-line Holiday Inn competition. Many thanks.  Off for a day around Chester, I'll have to remember to get out of the City before 18:00hrs as they still have an old law about shooting any Welsh in the city with a bow an arrow.  Have a great day.

      Well its the end of the day and I'm tired...guess my luck wasn't in as I didn't win the draw for the holiday, never mind tomorrows another day. What a day awaits as I've got to pick up a parcel from the Post Office (could it be a win!), I think I'll be on their door at 07:30 when they open. Also taking my mother out to Chester for a little day out, lets hope the weather stays nice.  Good night and may your god go with you! (if you have one, I don't but that shouldn't stop you)

      Has this country totally gone potty? How can a society possibly encourage the dross we see on our TV’s such as Channel 4’s Big Brother who’s tag line should read “Plumbing new depths for the intellectually challenged”.  How a sick twisted tranny like Nadia can win such a show is beyond me. Okay she’s a foreigner and for that possibly deserves some sympathy alone, but why do they have to come here and be all weird. For Christ’s sake don’t encourage them. Knowing this country she’ll probably get a morning TV show on C4 or 5, just like Kate Lawler (a previous years winner!) – great show Kate see your still on it – sorry my mistake, it got axed ‘cause you were crap!  I realise that often for many sad people in this country that other people’s lives are more satisfying than their own but come on lets have ‘normal’ people on shows, not trannies, gays, yardies, drug dealers, woman beaters and asylum seekers. (Don’t even get me started on asylum seekers, that’s for another rant another day!).  Give us programmes that people can succeed at using their skills and merits not a popularity contest based on stupidity and shock value.

      Really tired today. I had a late night watching a DVD of ‘Paycheck’ starring Ben Afleck. Quite an interesting story line and not a bad film on the whole. Got to bed even later by the time I had finished reading.  Also late last night I was trying the chase-up the contractor for our back garden. It’s so wet lately, ducks could happily live there! Possibly the ideal area for a pond – come to think of it I just need to add more water! Drown, you slimy slugs, drown!!!!!  An easy and most importantly quiet day to day is needed to help, ease me into the day. Will start the day by researching web site counters - why, because I can.  Fingers crossed for the Core Control Radio station draw for a holiday. Wish me luck!

      Everyone in work is talking about the programme last night about stag nights in the lovely city of Prague.  Why is it that the ‘yob culture society’ in which we live just wants to go out and get wasted and stoned or whatever slang they have for it nowadays! I understand that ‘Sex sells’ and its enticements etc but really do we always have to show programmes that appeal to the lowest common values in our land? No wonder Europeans think us Brits are yobs & louts. What has become of our culture and our standards? I remember when made in Britain stood for quality, now I understand it appears to mean crap!  Lamentably I see this kind of thing every day on the streets with stupid lads wearing Burberry baseball caps &amp; tracksuits and other fashion victims driving tastelessly overdone little cars that have had more money spent on than they are worth. And to the lads who ran out in front of my car last night and thought it was great fun because I had to screech to a halt (thank god for ABS!) all I can say is next time I won’t re-act as fast, 16 going on dead if you see what I mean.  Back on the subject, having been to Prague this year to get engaged to my lovely partner Beth, I can say it is a fantastic city with lots of culture and great things to see and do. What a friendly place and very clean! It could teach the so-called City of Culture to be, Liverpool, a thing or two. (Yes I’m from Liverpool and the only thing it has done so far for local people is drive the cost of houses up, ‘cause Londoners are snapping up the houses in the hope of quick profits).  Call me a snob by all means, I don’t care anymore.

      Cheeky bastards my employers, look at the insulting offer us ex-civil servants get from EDS, talk about shafting us over a barrell, they are taking the piss and they know it. They are probably laughing all the way to the bank.   Quote taken from a PCS union e-mail: 'Members may like to know that the amount on offer is 2.2% on the base competency points for all with box 3 or higher. Those who have achieved a box 2 will have £120 as a non consolidated bonus and those with a box 1 get £250 as a non consolidated bonus. Pay progression is once more not payable because of the current climate within EDS. However they have agreed to "enter into meaningful dialogue with PCS on a fair, reasonable, and affordable mechanism which provides all employees a realistic opportunity to achieve pay progression". To this end we have an initial meeting scheduled for October.'     As everyone one knows a percentage pay raise of naff all is naff all, thats basic schoolboy maths. Funny how the ex-ICL employees get approx 3 to 5 percent and I know some standard terms staff got upto 9%. They really are complete bastards, civvies who are about to be 'out-sourced' be warned.

      I was in the Trafford Centre the other day. I must admit I felt like a foreigner in my own country and a place where English is a second language, not the first! It got me thinking 'do I really want to stay in this country, I'd rather be a foreigner in a strange country than my own!'. It made me feel quite upset.  Then the other day on Channel 4 I saw a programme made by a black journalist about militant Asians in Birmingham; it hurt when they said that they would drive the 'whites' out and make the Middlelands into Pakistan. Would they allow people in their own Islamic countries to be militant Christians, I think not.  I don't wish this to come across as a racist rant, 'cause thats not the intention. I just wanted to vent some feelings - each to their own, I feel a line has been crossed but not sure where or even by who.  Why do I feel so guilty about feeling this way, should we all practice more tolerance or has that got us in this mess in the first place! I feel this could be the subject of a good book!  Peace &amp; love

      Well I've just got home from visiting my Mum who lives in Liverpool. I even stayed over for tea which was unusual for her to offer! - not ungrateful just puzzled - its not common for her to do this, mind you she did say she was missing some company as my brother works 16:00 through to 21:00 in a local hosptial.  Arriving home I got a rather nice LWE (long white envelope) waiting for me from the radio station Core Control where I won the previous nights competition of Bourne Identity goodies and I'm in the draw on Friday for a holiday, fingers crossed.  Tomorrows another day

He should have lots of interesting things to say as he likes a bit of agro! and is a bit of a eccentric nutter! Cheers Gareth!  Also included a scrolling message and yes the quote in from Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy!  42 man

      Well today in work I'm working for my other half - she's a great boss and lets me get away with murder - mainly trying to do the Galaxy Comp in "Guess whats in the Wheelie Bin".  God why are Mancs so thick - no one has it yet - I think its the Knight Rider E-Master Set.  I must get more On-Line comps done via my fav web site Loquax!!!!!  I've started the BLOG as I've always meant to have an On-Line diary but never got around to it - lets see how long this lasts?
