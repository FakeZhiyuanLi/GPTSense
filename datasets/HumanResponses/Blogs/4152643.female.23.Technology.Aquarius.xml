       **But you must REALLY listen, No interrupting, No daydreaming, No planning your response, Just listening**   Lately in my office and even sembang with my frens, everybody talk about the halalness of the Mc Donald`s and KFC`s. Maybe sebab baru habis MIHAS tu kot!! by the way I'm "against" anyone who insinuate that we should boycott mc donalds...bcos they being christians..and less sensitive towards muslims..and now with all the hatred that comes abt. Do we need to instill hatred into our young minds and heart? and continue the legacy? have we not seen enough hatred already in this world?   Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think McDonald's is a francise.  That means the McD's here in Malaysia are owned by Malaysians who have paid a very handsome sum to McD Inc. and have to pay a percentage of their gross profits to the franchisor.  So before McD the American company is hurt by the boycott, we would have hurt our fellow Malaysians first....and it included cases like the Bali bombings which killed innocent locals working in Bali not the Americans who own mc donalds sitting in their cushy chair in US. Another thing is the act of boycotting was something practised by the Jews and the kufar...even in the day of the Prophet...he still traded with the Jews in spite of everything....  And again....why attack only Mc Donalds? If you are in to boycotting what about Windows & all the PC technology?  But then again, if you wish to boycott....it is a personal preferance....nothing wrong with it...just that donâ€™t look down on those who do not boycott.....OK enuff!!   By the way untill now I still and still didnt make any decision whether to accpet da Penang offer tu or not?? still in awkward feeling....I just hope, I got a right target....Insyaallah......  ** Sorry if I terlalu "emotional" bout the Mc Donald`s issue tu!! Tak tau nak cakap pada siapa kecuali MY BLOG.COM :-)

       My Advice To Myself  by Ahmed  If you think you are beaten, You are; If you think you dare not, You don't; If you'd like to win, But you think you can't, It's almost certain you won't.  If you think you'll lose, You're lost; For out in the world we find Success begins with a fellow's will, It's all in the state of mind.  If you think you're outclassed, You are; You've got to think high, To rise. You've got to be sure of yourself Before you 'll ever win the prize.  Life's battles don't always go To the stronger or faster man, But sooner or later, The man who wins Is the person who thinks he can!

      Gosh.....  first of all, just got a good news from Penang last Monday!! Interview yg I attend last 2 weeks was accpeted!! meaning I diterima tuk keje kat sana start by next month!!! huahahahhahah i`m really, really happy!!! but ....boleh ke I start keje baru dengan situasi yg baru dan seorang diri disana??? tats the problem! abang boyoi encouraged me to accept de offer..I know he was the first person yg paling "HAPPY" dan "SAD" bila dapat tau I dapat offer nie...HAPPY coz finally I dapat jugak offer kat Comp yg lagi baik dan besar compair ngan IRIS nie dan interm of RM pun quiet better there!! SAD coz maybe he will be alone here without me ....(cehhh perasan gak aku nie kan????)dan takder dah org nak gaduh dengan dia lepas ni!! Tapi walau apa pun I didnt make any decision yet!! Until now!! serious!!    What else??Ohhh ... maybe by this week jugak abang boyoi dah nak fly to INDON. Kalau org2 kat INDON tu sibuk nak datang Malaysia, dia pulak sibuk nak pegi INDON! However I`m so proud dengan abang boyoi sebab struggle and lots of sacrifice yg dah dia buat untuk capai cita2 dia yg satu nie : to become an AEROSPACE ENGINEER!! wish you GOOD LUCK abang boyoi!!!  more later....
