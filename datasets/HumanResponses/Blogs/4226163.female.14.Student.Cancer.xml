      Amazing! I actually skipped a day!! That never happens. Well, yesterday was strange. My neighbor Cliff lost his dog. It's a HUMONGOUS black fluffy Newfoundland, like Beethoven (only solid black), but she's not wearing a collar. If anyone's seen this dog, her name is Ellie, and you should get her and call Animal Care and Control. It's very sad. See, yesterday, Cliff's friend took her to the beach while Cliff was at work and left the garage door open after he dropped Ellie off at home. My dad saw the door open at around 4:00 p, but by then Ellie was gone. So if anyone is in the Glen Park area or anywhere that surrounds it, keep you eyes peeled. She's not that hard to spot. Well, that's all the interesting stuff for now. Yay! It's Friday! Tomorrow I am going to Safari West in Santa Rosa overnight so don't expect anything for the next 2 days. (oh, no! what ever shall you do? Here, I know! go here:  urlLink http://www.jibjab.com/default.asp  and click on "This Land".)

      Well, it's Monday. And you know what that means? Tomorrow is Tuesday! And then, it's Wednesday! Yippee. I wish I had more interesting stuff to talk about. Oh! I know. I have a relative from Japan who used to live in Indonesia going to City College or something. That isn't interesting, is it?

      Hello again! Today is Sunday, and that means...nothing special. Well, I went to Union Street and then the Nihonmachi Street Festival, where I saw none other than Mr. Kim and Ms. Gutierrez from across the street. Well well well. I guess that's all there is to say about today. Watched more Olympics. Rather dull, but that Michael Phelps guy is pretty interesting.

      Hey y'all. Um...well, today was rather uneventful. Let's see...I went to the farmer's market today, but they were really close to closing, since I woke up at 10 am. So we bought stuff and went home and did absolutely nothing. Well, we watched the Olympics and something about plastic sugery. So, since there is nothing else to say, I will tell you about my strange experiences at the Russian River with my grandparents, aunt, and cousin. So...left on Sunday morning. Boring car ride, etc. When we got there, my aunt's friend's family was already there. There were so many of them!! Like, 10 or something. Ok: Janice, Rick (14), Leonore  and boyfriend Victor, Andrea, Angela, Lorraine. Plus another family: Mark &amp; Anne and Andrew and Steven (15 and 12). Everyone was really nice and stuff, since I had never been before. Are you getting bored? Sorry... Well, blah blah blah. I learned how to play Knock and Speed and swam a lot and got sunburned. On Tuesday, we drove to Cazadero to this bakery, but it was closed. Turns out, the bakery is literally across the street from the Cazadero Performing Arts Camp! On Wednesday, we drove to Occidental, and on the way is CYO Caritas and Westminster Woods. Amazing! And the rest of the time was rather boring. On the last night I played cards with the boys, winning against Rick (haha!!) and Steven. But not Andrew. Darn. And pissed off my cousin, who threatened to beat all of us with a watergun, which promptly broke in her hands. Rick just happened to have his faithful stickwith him, and scared her off. My cousin was watching the Teen Choice Awards too, and the boys took frequent breaks to goggle at Halle Berry, Paris Hilton, and Lindsey Lohan. Ugh...Later, Rick left his shoes in our bedroom, so we secretly stuffed them with marshmallows and returned them. He wasn't awake by the time we left, so we woke him up and told him. Afterwards, he ate a couple out of his shoes. Eeewww! I have smelled those shoes, and I don't know how we even stood putting the marshmallows in them. Sayonara...till next time.

         Hey everyone! Wow! This is so cool!      Well, anyways, here I am...It's summer time and I have nothing better to do.     Let's see...Today I have to do my homework. I have to finish reading Jitterbug   Perfume, which is a really good book, but kind of hard to do a report on. And   Communist Manifesto, which I need to start on. Oh well...I use too many   ellipses. Good bye for now.Wait! I have to write one more line so it's a rainbow...Ooooh, pretty !
