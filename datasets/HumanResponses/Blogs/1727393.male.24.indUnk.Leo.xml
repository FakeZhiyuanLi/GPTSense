      i'm stupider than stupid.  went bowling last nite, that was tons of fun, it was the first time i'd been in a while, since sometime last year.  yesterday was fun, definitely long, but fun.  i didn't get into work until like eleven, that was mostly because i didn't get to sleep til like half past two.  bowling kept me busy til like midnite, and i got home around a half hour after that.  of course i didn't have the good sense to go to bed, but it worked out better anyway i think.  so today's my day off and i'm at home, but i didn't go to sleep til sometime after seven this morning.  that was definitely not the move, at least physically.  there just really isn't much good that can happen when you lay down to go to sleep for the night and the sun's already up.  already up, as opposed to still up.  anyways, about an hour after i went to sleep i got woke up by some dummy crushing cans.  i did get to sleep for about five hours tho, but i got woke up by the phone about half past noon.  right now it's almost four and i've done jack.  i really wanted to get my oil changed and wash my car.  there's also quite a bit of cleaning that i should do around here, but i've been totally useless.  i wanted to write letters today.  Laura wrote me a few weeks ago, and i need to write her back soon, Lisa wrote me too and i've wanted to write her ever since she went back to illinois.    now i think it'll have been a successful day if i manage to take a shower.  feeling: like i need a shower thinking of: sleep, wistfully music: "la vie", billy sprague

      i need a better phone.  i've got this cordless, it's not bad, i've had the displeasure of using some terrible cordless phones in the past.  mostly in my parents' house, and i think they were so staticky because of all the police radio interference that you get in the hood.  but anyways, i can't ever really have a conversation on the phone without it crapping out on me after about three or four hours.  i have letters to write, i'll probably get around to that tomorrow.  feeling: charged-up thinking of: bowling music: "the ballad of country dick", mojo nixon

      arr.  this has to stop.  for the second time this week, i'll attempt to get through a day after getting less than my ususal six hours or so or sleep.  i'm going on four and a half today, made it to sleep at three and woke up half past seven.  i felt pretty terrible when i woke up, but showering made it all better.  i have no idea how some people can not shower in the morning, if i didn't, i'd go through life as a total zombie.  i had a pretty good reason for staying up so late tho.  ok, off to work. . .  feeling: awake thinking of: dunx music: "duel at the two-o'clock bell", reverend horton heat

      i'm sort of a dummy.  but it was a good day.  i got mail today.  real mail, not bills or the pennysaver or anything like that.  birthday card from the grandparents and a letter from dorey.  that ripped.  and then as though the day couldn't have gotten any better, she called, made my whole day twice.  yesterday was good too.  i'm a bit tired from it, tho it was fun and i did get to see the supertones for the first time in like six years.  it was an outdoor show, which i don't really like too much.  it's just hard to get into a band when they're playing on a stage that's about a quarter mile from where you're sitting.  i'd get into the constituency of the crowd there, but neither of us wants that, really.  so i got home around half past eleven, found two messages waiting for me, one was my dad.  he called to see if i saw the soccer game, Mexico played Brasil.  they won, beat them 1-0 for the second time in two weeks.  i didn't get to see the whole game, just most of the second half and overtime.  the other message was nice.  i'm off for now, monday night raw is on, i gotta take out the trash, and i'm expecting a phone call.  it'll be great  feeling: texas thinking of: thunderstorms music: "ignite", the oc supertones

      good day today.  season opener for the horns, they tore it up 66-7, what was really nice about the game was that it was actually shown out here on the west coast.  it'll likely be the last time i see them til sometime in november, so it was nice to get my fix.  it's weird watching a college game now, knowing that pretty much all of the players on the field are younger than me.  i talked to nicole today, which was the first time in forever, it wasn't for very long but it was still really nice.  today was actually full of pretty good conversations, laura, lisa, annie, tara, emily, and of course bone, who remains linked despite his talk of personal dermatological issues, he gets a pass because yesterday he said i was likely the most patient person he'd ever met, made my day it did.  enjoy labor day tomorrow.    feeling: solid thinking of: coloring music: "august in bethany" the juliana theory

      i went to a boys' school.  one of the things you learn going to a school like that, a tight-knit, private school, is how politics works, not like campaign politics where you're shaking hands and telling lies to get elected or anything like that.  it's the kind of politics where you know there are certain people who aren't really fans of yours, and you even know who they are, however, you would never know it based on your actual interaction with them.  when people have a problem with you, somehow you don't hear it from them, either that or you're the last person to hear about it.  and if you do hear it from them, it doesn't stop there.  it's like that time a teacher overheard me say the word "ass" in the hallway.  he was one of those guys that seemed to take it personally when you did something that he didn't agree with, something that upset him.  i got griped out for it, which i understood, it wasn't a stellar decision on my part, and i could see how it would upset someone, and i thought that was that.    well you know how it is, that wasn't that, and i ended up on the list the next day, which i found out was for my verbal indiscretion and i ended up having to write a letter of apology for it.  once more, i figure that to be the end of it.  so i was a bit surprised to get a phone call at home from my wrestling coach, who  never  called me at home, saying that he'd heard in a meeting he was in that someone was complaining that i'd cussed out a teacher and only had to write a letter of apology for it, evidently someone wasn't finished with his blabbing.  my coach just wanted to know if it was true, because it didn't sound like me, so i tell him the story, and seeing how different the truth was to what he'd heard, told me to call BS on them for spreading stuff about me that wasn't true.  i'm not bitter about it or anything, and i share that story for a couple reasons, first because i know that people have said stuff about me behind my back with regularity, people that seem to have no problem with me when i see them face to face, it's part of life and it happens to everyone, but that's the  only  time that i recall even having the opportunity to give someone their comeuppance over it, so i've more or less realized that there's no use getting frustrated over it or consumed with trying to clear my name, which leads to the second reason, it's happening again.  i've heard from a couple different people that some are saying things about me that aren't really true and that the people talking are people who've never mentioned anything to me about it, people that are cordial to me.  it's not problematic to me personally, i don't have any reason to question my own integrity and i'm not insecure enough to let it bug me, but since it's happening, it's an issue and i'm somewhat miffed by that.  the only real difference is that no one's trying to get elected.  feeling: prepared thinking of: james music: "pepper" butthole surfers

      i watched mtv last nite.  it's not something i do very often, in fact, it's something i'd be happy to avoid altogether.  i was thinking that it's mostly because, age-wise, i'm on the tail end of their target demographic, but then i thought about it for a second and realized that that's definitely not true, they expect people my age to watch.  i read a study a while ago that declared that people aren't generally considered adults until age twenty-six.  i was willing to go along with that, i'm twenty-three and i have a hard time considering myself a "grown-up."  i'm sure that there's nothing magical about the age of twenty-six, but regardless of the number, it shows that people realize that adolescence continues for a period of time well beyond the age of eighteen.  mtv is, i think, more than a little responsible for that, mostly because they manage to co-opt the thought process of so many people by appealing to their desire to be sensorily stimulated, and idly entertained.  nate called last night, and it was good to be able to talk to him again.  he's one of the people that makes me feel a little bad that i left chicago.  he's doing well, said  he broke his wrist, but he's doing his best with it, it's not caused him to miss any shows, he's just singing now instead of singing and playing guitar.  anyone in dallas want to come out next weekend?  dfw to long beach is $169 on american, september 5-9 only.  feeling: friday-ish thinking of: no three-day weekend music: "someday like today" paradigm (nate's band)

      so i've been reading theology again.  it's not something i try to do terribly, terribly often as it can prove to be maddening after a while.  there are a few reasons why it's that way, the one that springs to mind first is that lot of it is written by people that are so much smarter than me that it's unreal.  when that's the case, reading stuff like that can be intimidating, which i suspect is because essential perceptions of reality are at stake, and those carry tons of significance.  that's not what bothers me the most, however, but i guess what bothers me most sort of grows out of that.  in reading stuff like that, i've noticed a tendency by many who theorize, and make no mistake, that all anyone can do when attempting theology, to see things in strictly typological terms.  that is to say that people construct it in ways that are dualistic, one way (invariably  their  way) is the right way, and everything else stands in opposition.  don't get me wrong, not everyone does it, i just happen to run into enough of it to make me feel like it's problematic.  there seems to be a dearth of humility, not even so much as an inkling of an "i could be wrong about this. . ."  i almost get the impression that people think that since they're talking about God, humility is optional.  it rubs me the wrong way and sort of makes me realize it's no surprise that people who profess faith are often found so irritating by those who don't.  i'll stop, i'm probably not helping.  feeling: empathetic thinking of: dr. al nieves music: "man in black" johnny cash

      this is the last week before school starts.  not that it's of any  real  consequence to me, i'm not in school, taking classes or anything like that, but i do work with students so i'm still acutely aware of the school calendar.  i'm in one of the places where kids still don't actually start school until after labor day, the flip side is that they don't get out for the summer til mid-june sometime.  friends in texas (hi Laura!!) have been in class for a week and a half or so, friends at wheaton start class today.  so i'm thinking about school and this is the second fall where i'm not a participant in the whole thing, i mean unless you count the years before i started kindergarten, but this is the first time that i feel really aware of it.  my attention was sort of dominated last year by trying to find a place to live and stuff like that, i'll talk more about that on monday i think, but right now i've got this sort of feeling that i'm missing out on something, even though i realize that thousands of students long for the day they can live through an august/september that doesn't see them start school.  other stuff, hmm.  i added another link, this time to paul's website, replete with blog.  paul's a good man, being a former wrestling teammate, he's one of few people who's seen me with a buzzcut, it wasn't pretty.  last time i saw him, if i recall, was when we had lunch at chili's, the one at preston & lbj and that was  far  too long ago.  yah so there's that and bone has a job interview next week, i know, his blog said so.  it's in the thriving metropolis that is cedar rapids, iowa.  i definitely don't envy him the destination, though i am a bit envious of where his stopover'll be, my kinda town, it is.  if it all works out, he'll be doing something he wants/likes to do, and, he'll put dallas, texas in his rearview mirror, both things i figure he wants sooner than later, so i hope it shakes out well.  i think i'll go back, as soon as i can figure out what i want to study.  suggestions, as always, are welcome.  feeling: vital, i've been running lately thinking of: clothes in the dryer music: "dear friend" charlie peacock

      Wesley Willis 1963-2003  it was four or five years ago that i was first introduced to the music of Wesley Willis.  my brother played the song "they threw me out of church" for me and when i first heard it, stupid would not have begun to describe my opinion of it.  i told my brother that he owed me for the three minutes of my life spent listening to that song.  if you're famiiar with Willis' work, you probably have a good idea about why i felt that way and you can skip the next couple of sentences describing it.  Willis suffered from chronic schizophrenia and said he made music to escape from the voices in his head, voices that he said tormented him.  the entire song was done on a technics keyboard, the kind you can get at wal-mart.   a mere three chords made up the musical arrangement, and the lyrics consisted mostly of willis repeating "they threw me out of church, they threw me out of church" in a voice that seemed to carry a wail more than it did a tune.  the song ended, as i found out all of his songs do, with him calmly saying "rock over london, rock on chicago."  before simply dismissing it, he urged me to listen to the song again, i did and was more than slightly amused, it had grown on me a little bit.  i won't say that a love affair with Wesley Willis' music started there, i enjoyed it, to be sure, but it didn't.  and though I enjoyed that song, and went on to hear many more of his songs, i always felt a bit weird listening to his music, like he was a sort of sideshow because of his schizophrenia, or that i was even somehow patronizing him by listening to his music and seeing humor in it, being amused by it.  i equated laughing at his music, which was hilarious, with laughing at  him .  when i realized that i was listening to someone who truly, not just enjoyed, but  loved  what he did, i didn't feel so bad.  i felt like i was sharing in his joy.  we live in a culture where so much of what is produced for our entertainment has this nice glossy sheen to it.  a lot of work goes into giving public figures, musicians especially, these images that are fit for public consumption.  handlers go to painstaking lengths to project only the image that they want us as fans to be aware of.  Willis, on the other hand, oozed authenticity.  he was simple, he sang about what he liked, said what he felt and did so within his ability.  there was nothing fancy about him; he didn't try to do anything he couldn't, or be something he wasn't, no team of people working to proffer a caricature of him to the public.    in an industry where something like avril lavigne's handlers hiding the fact that she's dating her bass player from the public because it would detract from the image they try to produce for her is the rule, as opposed to the exception, Wesley Willis brought something that most of the rest of us could never have even dreamed of.  he was truly a breath of fresh air.  Wesley Willis decided and managed to be himself in an industry and even a culture where doing so is largely not allowed.  Wesley Willis died monday night, just before nine in his hometown of chicago.  Wills, with his mental health struggles, was not what many would consider a talented or intelligent individual by any stretch, obviously never seriously critically acclaimed, or anything like that.  i didn't know Wesley Willis or anything like that, he had bigger fans than me so i won't pretend that this is particularly sad news for me personally or anything like that, but i'm appreciative of the originality, honesty and total lack of pretense that Willis brought to what he did, i wish more people would do the same.  rock over london, rock on chicago.

      i've been spoiled by mechanical solidarity.  maybe a bit of a primer is in order here, mechanical solidarity, you might recall, is a concept articulated by emile durkheim (one of the three fathers of sociology, Karl Marx and Max Weber being the other two) that describes how in certain communities people's associations are dictated more by who their neighbors are and their proximity to them than anything else.  that's pretty much what college is, well was for me anyway, living on campus at a small school, the kind of community where socially, most everybody is in the same situation, going to classes, doing homework, being surrounded by familiar people, people with whom affinity is shared.  but anyways, i'm not really spoiled by it anymore, mostly because i haven't experienced it in over a year.  i think that's the most difficult part of the post-college adjustment. out of college, in places where organic solidarity takes the place of mechanical solidarity, people's associations are dictated not by neighborhood connections and things like that, but more by elective affinity kind of things, workplace, clubs, church, stuff like that.  what i'm getting used to is not being surrounded by people who are largely in the same situation i find myself in.   maybe i just need a roommate.  feeling: somewhat isolated thinking of: structural-functional theory, that's not like me at all music: "mexico" the refreshments

      arg, i'm a dope.  i'm on the phone right now, with what i'm sure is a lovely lady who works for american airlines.  they've always been more than helpful and right now i got a couple things going with them.  what i'm focusing on right now is the ticket i'm trying to get for my dad to come out here for thanksgiving.  see, there's potential for confusion because we have the same name, the only difference is in the middle initial, i have a middle name, he doesn't, whcih also means i'm not a jr., but that's neither here nor there.  i'd just hate for him to get to the check-in desk and have to show them  my  credit card, which he most definitely wouldn't have.  yah, that'd be a drag.  the other thing is sort of an aggrevation and is what had me thinking i was a dope, i bought my ticket to see katie in october a few weeks ago, thinking i was doing a pretty good job buying it on a fairly advanced deal for $335, not cheap, by any means, but definitely not anything exorbitant, so anyways, i'm logging on to AA.com to get this ticket for my dad, and i look at my netsaver matches, and that same flight to raleigh is now $198, a weaker man would have tossed his computer out the second floor window next to which it sits.    isn't this exciting?  play-by-play of me making travel plans, the AA lady, her name's ellen and she seems really nice, has got me on hold now, because i can get credit for the difference between the $335 i paid and the $198 the ticket costs now and it seems as though i can apply the discount from the newly reduced fare to NC to the ticket i'm buying from dallas.  that'd be sweet, so we'll see what happens.  i'll talk about other stuff now, it was a good weekend.  last night was a going-away party for wes, not old roommate wes, one of the seniors who's going off to school this week, and that was nice, he's getting a good send-off and i'm excited for him.  sunday was good, relaxing, and really that's what sundays are s'posed to be.  this week'll be good, not too terribly busy, but it's got enough to keep me occupied.  it's nice tonite, i think i'll go outside.  feeling: somewhat industrious thinking of: how i tore it up on my MFL predictions this week music: "unsaid" MxPx

      i'm awake.  got to see west side story last night, actually the first time i saw it on stage, i'd seen the movie before and it was pretty good, even though i'm not terribly terribly into musicals.  the show was put on by middle and high school students and it was really well done, the only gripe was that the tech sucked and, at points, it was really hard to understand what was being said/sung.  i'm not sure how i feel about being awake really.  used to, when saturday rolled around, looking at the back of my eyelids until sometime around noon was a relative certainty.  the only thing that would usually bust that up was either football or wrestling, both of which required rising at ungodly hours, especially for a saturday morning, and in the case of wrestling, having to be at school before sunrise.   [sidebar] talking about that reminds me of the time i had to show up for weigh-ins at a tournament at seven, this place was across town, which meant i had to be up between half past five and six that morning.  i weigh-in, check the brackets, see that i have a first round bye, and relax, figuring i'll have to wrestle a bit after noon.  well noon rolls around and i'm not even close, so i grab a bagel or something.  the hours roll by and finally i see my bout number, by this time it's almost 10PM.  what's funnier is that win or lose, i had *another* match after that.  so yah, i ended up winning that match, and summarily went home.  it just woudn't have been worth staying til midnight.[/sidebar]  i don't really sleep in anymore though, like today i got out of bed around half past nine and today's a saturday, a day where i don't have to be anywhere til around six tonight.  i don't think i could stay in bed til noon even if i wanted to.  i feel like i've conditioned myself to be able to operate pretty efficiently on between six and seven hours of sleep, if i get eight or more, i feel positively useless the next day   you know how it works, you never feel useless on days you can actually  afford  to be useless.  feeling: surly thinking of: grilled cheese music: "austin song" 100 Portraits

      thursday was good.  didn't really do much which was the plan to begin with, so that worked out beautifully.  one thing i probly should have done that i didn't was make some phone calls, long distance ones, keep up with people and stuff.  part of the trouble of living on the west coast is the whole time zone thing, all the friends i woulda called yesterday were either central (lisa, wes) or eastern (katie).  katie teaches kindergarten.  lisa's moving, starting school and stuff, so's wes.  wes majored in trumpet, and now he's going to grad school for trumpet.  that sounds funnier than it actually is.  i also wanted to call home, catch up with my dad, it's been a couple weeks since we last talked.  shite at home's messed up, my mom hasn't called, and i know why she hasn't called, i'd call her, but that'd cause more problems than it'd solve.  long story short, she's moved out, told my dad not to tell me because she wanted to, and i'm pretty sure she's trepidacious of the conversation that'll take place when she  does  tell me.  i found out anyway from my brother, so i think she still doesn't know i know.  my brother is allegedly married, which supposedly happened about a month ago, i'm excited for him and everything, but he's 18 and trying to start school this year.  i hope it works out for him.  ironically the phone conversation that i did have yesterday was worth so much less than the time spent having it, that's probably what i get for not being proactive with the other ones.    soliciting advice through the comments link today.  feeling: good thinking of: the weekend music: "all there is to know" phil keaggy

      day-offing it today.  new links today, just two, one is my amazon wishlist.  i don't really expect anybody to get me anything, but i figure it couldn't hurt to put the thing up there for a couple of reasons.  it  would  be pretty sweet if someone did end up getting me something, since books aren't necessarily the first thing i think to spend my money on.  the other reason is that it might serve to provide some insight into me for some people who don't know me all that well.  the other one is a link to some pictures, there's about twenty of them, most of them are from last summer.  so there you have it i guess.  made it to the beach last night, probably for the last time this summer.  this week's been pretty busy, monday was 11 hrs at work and yesterday was 12, so i'm trying to keep it simple today.  my big day off rule is that i won't darken the door of the office, which unfortunately doesn't preclude errands and stuff like that.  i really shouldn't complain, having a weekday off to do stuff like that beats trying to squeeze it in on a weekend with a stick.    like today i think i need to run to the grocery store, this despite the fact that i was there on sunday.  it happens once in a while, i gotta go back and get some stuff i forgot, it's mostly because i don't make lists, which is to say that i don't really write much of anything down.  i''ve never found it to be terribly helpful, despite the times it proves to be a slight inconvenience, mostly i've found it just serves to give me something else to do, another detail to keep up with.   i'm not the most detail oriented person.  feeling: relaxed thinking of: rachel, in japan now music: "kid" bouncing souls

      presumptuousness bugs me.  you ever have one of those conversations that makes you consider self-immolation as a viable alternative?  i've had those before, i won't say how recently the last one was, but it's got me thinking about the difficulty of communication.  people throw that term around as though it was the easiest thing in the world to do, and to be honest, the concept is actually very simplistic, you tell someone what you're feeling, what you're thinking, there's not just a whole lot to it.  somewhere, however, the process gets convoluted, people get rubbed the wrong way, they get irritated, stuff like that.  for some reason what we say is rarely heard by another the way it sounds in our own head.  it's almost as though something gets lost in translation.  we hear something other than what the person we're talking to meant and instead of making the effort to really get what the other person is saying, we find it a lot easier to simply presume that we do and then make judgements or form perceptions based on that.  presumptuousness often replaces patience in the process of communication.  i wonder if people right now could even recognize patience if they saw it.  feeling: misunderstood thinking of: the beach music: "kite" U2

      so i fell asleep on the couch last nite.  it happens every once in a while and it can be pretty maddening.  i can't stay asleep the whole night when i fall asleep there, so i usually wake up around one or so and am just coherent enough to realize that i'm not in bed and that i need to go there.  wouldn't want to sleep through bedtime, although i think i would hate life if i woke up one morning on the couch and realized i hadn't slept in my bed that nite, i'm pretty sure my imagination would convince myself that i hadn't slept at all, and who really needs that.  it's cloudy today, i want to go fishing.  feeling: a duller pain than yesterday thinking of: changing the name of the blog to "the back pain chronicles" music: "red carpet and rebellion" the distillers

      so another week begins.  it actually began yesterday, but then it's all sort of arbitrary anyway.  i'll let someone else argue about whether the week starts on sunday or monday.  i never used to think about it that much, and i feel like i'm thinking about it now because i'm past any point where days will run together anymore.  each day is pretty distinctive now, which is nice, because it keeps monotony at a minimum and i don't do real well with monotony.  monotony, that's a funny word, and it makes me think of the school cafeteria in middle school.  every once in a while we'd have what were called monotony breakers which was basically just a dessert that we didn't usually have, like a funnel cake or something.  the biggest actual difference was the big banner that said "monotony breaker" that went on the back cafeteria wall.  nothing against funnel cakes either, but it felt weird eating them in the cafeteria at school as opposed to the fair, kinda like eating a hot dog at someplace besides the ballpark.  so anyways, i went grocery shopping yesterday and it still blows my mind how expensive that can get.  i didn't even get all that much stuff and ended up dropping nearly $70.  i didn't mind so much because it was the first time i could get fridge food without having to think about how long it would last in my fridge.  my back still hurts, i've been reduced to pondering the merits of icy-hot.  feeling: a dull pain thinking of: wes, whatever happened to that guy? music: "duane joseph" the juliana theory

      my back is killing me.  it's like wisdom teeth, back pain is the kind of thing that sort of makes you realize you're old, or at least think about it if you're not.  i'm sure it's nothing that's a big deal it's not a chronic deal or anything like that and on top of that i can think of a couple reasons why it's hurting, either because i slept funny last nite, or it's the delayed effect from carrying that stupid fridge up the stairs by myself.  so anyways, i'm looking at the first sentence of the last paragraph and i'm realizing that getting wisdom teeth isn't like back pain at all.  wisdom teeth don't really make you realize that you're old, maybe i think that because i had enough room for mine, so i could definitely be wrong.    age is a funny thing, especially with its relationship to maturity.  it's kinda sad that we're, by and large, narrow minded enough to think that age and maturity can share only a relationship of positive correlation.  that is to say that we've come to believe that maturity can only increase with age, or put more finely, that only age, by nature accompanies increased maturity.  that's not to say anything of our penchant to project that paradigm nearly uniformly and unequivocally.  making an attempt to view maturity in other ways opens the door to admitting that we *have* to look at things subjectively, and worse yet (for many, anyways) it opens the door to ambiguity.  ambiguity serves to make a lot of us uncomfortable, we find solace in certainty and ambiguity takes away from that.  it's the kind of thing that forces us to actually be thoughtful as opposed being bound by knee-jerks and broad strokes, which, ironically, we often find more comfortable.  when we're locked into a perception that allows a formula or an algorithm to do our thinking for us we don't allow ourselves to be challenged by truth that we might encounter.  i've rambled long enough.  next time, i'll use my legs.  feeling: melancholy thinking of: my bench music: "little things" bush

      it was good.  i have trouble sometimes building something up in my head so much that it can never hope to live up to expectations.  i'm certain i'm not the only person that does that sort of thing, and that the people that do make up much more than a small minority of the population.  that happened when i saw office space for the first time, although, i think that was primarily due to the fact that the movie had been ridiculously talked up by those who'd seen it before.    luckily, it's not a problem i had this weekend, and it's usually not a problem when i get to reunite with a friend, especially one that i haven't seen in a while.  duncan was here last night and i'm gonna say all the stuff you'd probly expect me to say, it was great to see him, awesome catching up, stuff like that.  what dawned on me about this friendship in particular is that there's a definite ease in it, there's no pressure, no expectations, we could have sat on the couch and looked at the walls, or sat out on the back walkway while he smoked all night and not regretted a second.  i thought about it some more and began to realize that that ease is present in pretty much every friendship i have, it felt nice.  the whole thing is double-edged however, because after having been here nearly a year, i don't feel like i've met anyone who can be as good a friend as any of the friends i have already.  i don't know whether to feel discouraged about that, maybe because of an inability to relate to people or a fear of letting new people into my life, or if i was just terribly,terribly blessed by the people that have been in my life before.  i think i've become pretty picky about it, more and more i find myself becoming increasingly stringent about the definition of the word "friend."  i don't want to go as far as to say it's a quality vs. quantity sort of thing, but in ways that's what it feels like.  we'll pick up where we left off.  feeling: decompressed thinking of: the phone music: "untitled" social distortion

      i don't use an alarm clock.  most people wonder how i manage to do that and ever wake up, but it's never really been a big issue for me.  i don't go in to work until nine, and i'm usually awake and out of bed by seven.  today was an exception, i didn't get out of bed til a bit after half past seven.  i had a discussion with my brother about it once, and he arrived at the conclusion that since i woke up at more or less the same time every day, despite the fact that i didn't rely on an alarm clock, that i was sleep deprived.  that didn't make any sense to me because it wasn't like a forced, involuntary action on my part, at least it didn't ever feel that way.  when i wake up, i'm usually rather coherent, and not feeling terrible or anything like that.  screw,  screw  the network exec that took gloria calzada off the air.  feeling: a bit sore thinking of: dying days of summer music: "luckenbach, texas" willie nelson and waylon jennings

      i'm sort of jealous.  dunx is on his way out, left this morning from dallas.  he's headed back to portland for the start of school and should be here tomorrow night.  that'll be sweet, i haven't seen him since may.  so to the point, the jealousy is mostly tounge in cheek.  thinking of dunx driving out here from dallas reminded me that it's been nearly a year since i've really been able to take a road trip, a year since i was able to get in the car and spend a whole day driving.  there was that day in january when i went to fresno, but even that was just four hours each way, and if you can make it there and back in a day, then it's not really a road trip.  mostly it has to do with where i live and its proximity to any place i'd really have a reason to go.  living in chicago, the trip to dallas was fourteen hours driving, which was long enough to be a drain, but short enough to get done in just a solid day of driving.  out here, i'm at least a two day drive from anyplace i'd really have any reason to go, at least at this point.  on top of that, and i'm sure this is due to how i've socialized myself to perceive road trips, but for some reason, i feel like i have to be surrounded by miles and miles of rolling wheatfields.  maybe it's not the wheatfields at all, but there's a qualitatively different feel driving through the heartland compared to driving through the southwest.  the fallout from that is that i have to fly everywhere now.  it's not so bad, i don't mind flying really, although i'm pretty sure i don't enjoy it either.  i've also figured out that the long beach airport is pretty much the best airport in the entire country as far as avoiding typical "airport hassle," so if i have to fly semi-regularly, i've got a pretty convenient airport to do it out of.  i do wish i could make the drive home or to chicago or someplace in a day as opposed to two though.  as far as i can see that's been the biggest drawback to being here, well that and being away from the people i'd be driving to see.  other than that today was a bit adventuresome.  i went to wal mart and finally got a new fridge.  it's a mini one, but big enough to suit me.  i didn't want to go all out and get a brand new full size one, and i definitely wasn't going the resale route at all again.  funny thing though, as i was trying to load the merch into my lil car i was petitioned for gas money by a couple of women on their way to bakersfield.  one of them said her husband had beat her up and they were getting away.  it was pretty cool, they were driving a truck and offered to haul my fridge so i wouldn't have to fight with my back seat to get it in, or subsequently out.   i wonder about all that, because i know i'm a pretty trusting guy, ok very trusting.  and i put myself in a position where i definitely could have been taken advantage of.  some would say that because i did help them then i *did* get taken advantage of.  one day we'll talk about fundamental human nature, me and you.  feeling: full of anticipation and recharged, day off and all thinking of: dunx, safe travel for him music: "just don't want coffee" caedmon's call

      i'm a pushover.  bone made no promise of ceasing the talk about shaving his back and he made his way into the links section anyway.  i'm not sure how i rationalized that, we go back quite a ways.  i think he'd link me even if i talked about shaving my back.  it's either that or the realization that he might very well be the only person with whom i can talk about the  heavy  homosexual undertones in the teenage mutant ninja turtles.  here's the text of that conversation: alceste1103: if i were a ninja turtle - who would i be? ricv56: raphael alceste1103: f**k alceste1103: why? ricv56: ??? alceste1103: cause man, chicks don't like raphael, they like michelangelo ricv56: i dunno that you fit him as much as you just don't seem to fit any of the other ones alceste1103: and i'm not michelangelo, i'm raphael ricv56: michaelangelo is a sack of crap alceste1103: i think he's gay ricv56: i think he's the only one that's not alceste1103: michelangelo? ricv56: raphael alceste1103: whew ricv56: i thought you were saying you thought raphael was gay alceste1103: nope ricv56: good ricv56: i think he's the only solid hetero in the bunch alceste1103: what about splinter? pederast? ricv56: likely ricv56: a four hundred year old rat cohabitating in a sewer (read:underground) with four teenagers alceste1103: so what? it's all a homosexual allegory? ricv56: don't even get me started on shredder, krang, bebop and rocksteady alceste1103: oh no alceste1103: oh, you have to explain this to me ricv56: a warthog and a rhinoceros? if that's not code for beastiality, i don't know what is alceste1103: hmm alceste1103: that's pretty thin ricv56: and a disembodied brain lives in a man's crotch co-leading an alliance of evil with an insecure ex samurai who keeps his face covered? alceste1103: so? ricv56: that just screams S&M alceste1103: g*dd*mn, some days i get down on my knees and thank god i know you  i added a few other links, mostly of personal interest, stuff like c.s. lewis, john wesley, and jim goad.  i bet that's the first time those three guys have ever been mentioned in the same sentence.   it's goad that's the wildcard there.  lewis gives us "mere christianity", wesley, "a plain account of christian perfection" and from goad we get "the redneck manifesto."  i was surprised by goad's book, i first saw it in a borders in wheaton, and expected, as the title might suggest, it to be written from a total right-wing "we're under attack" point of view, probably solely in "rant" style.  i picked it up and, after a few pages, knew i  had  to get it.  goad does rant, it's probably what he does best, but his book was ridiculously well-researched.  i read it on a flight from LA to austin, and finished it quicker than i can remember finishing anything else of comparable length.  the book and his website are definitely not for kids, however.  had a really good conversation with laura last night, definitely the highlight of the day.  other than that, i worked on cleaning up my office and did some studying.  school's gonna start here in about three weeks, which means i'll have lil kids on tuesday afternoons again and i won't have time to organize myself or do much study.  future education is definitely weighing on the brain now.  i'm pretty stoked about lunch the sunday before christmas now.  feeling: peaceful thinking of: 709 Michigan St. 8B, Wheaton, IL 60187 music: "wishlist" pearl jam

      i have two boxes of crayons.  the big box, the box of 64.  i hear rumors that crayola's made an even bigger box than that, one with 96 in it, but i think 96 crayons would definitely overwhelm me.  one box is in my office, the other one in my living room.  i feel like they help to keep me centered despite the fact that their value is primarly symbolic in that i don't really feel like they add anything substantial to my life.  i mean i don't spend just a whole lot of time coloring or anything like that.  i usually only use them when i'm making something for someone else.  i don't even really have to use them for them to be of value, one look usually provides a pretty solid reminder of times that were really simple, and anyone that knows me knows that i value simplicity quite a bit.  so anyways, today's tuesday and there's not just a whole lot on the agenda today.  i need to clean up my office, which is a mess and has been for a while.  my desk is pretty buried.  dunx should be here later this week on his way to portland, it'll be good to see him.  bone is going back to dallas in a couple days and the packing seems to be moving along for him, which is impressive.  in need of more socks.  feeling: pedestrian thinking of: Laura, she's amazing, and i hope she has a better day today than she did yesterday music: "i broke out your windshield" wesley willis

      Jonas Ortiz--September 20, 1982-August 11, 1999  four years ago today.  four years and it's so ridiculously difficult for me to believe that so much time has passed since then.  that was a messed up day.  the story actually started about a week before that, when he got shot.  that was on my birthday, i remember getting home that night, being there for a few minutes and then getting the phone call and finding out what had happened.  pretty much immediately, we took off for the hospital.  from the get, it didn't look good, he'd been hit in the head, but he hung on for just over a week before he crossed over.  i realize that it's largely trite and cliche to talk about how close we were and all the other stuff that comes with death.  the questions like "why him?"  and the statements like "he was so young, just 16", stuff like that.  i still don't really know why, and i suspect that questions like that are never answered to anyone's satisfaction in lifetimes that we can perceive.  they've never been answered to my satisfaction, that's for sure.  what's humbling, however, is the realization that my satisfaction is not of paramount, or even peripheral significance.  realistically, there is pain, and i had to get used to living without someone close to me, that wasn't easy and it took easily a year before i got over that.  what blew my mind was that that coincided with the point where i realized that reality for me and reality for jonas was so radically different.  c.s. lewis weighs in, you knew he would, saying    "a man's dying is more the survivor's affair than his own."     those questions and concerns and doubts that i have don't matter, not because they're trivial, but because they don't matter to Jonas, not anymore anyway.  rest in peace, Jonas, and know that you're missed.  feeling: joyful thinking of: heaven music: "see you in heaven" guardian; "hold me jesus" rich mullins; "my name is jonas" weezer

      i's back  i wasn't really gone that long, not even 24 hours.  it was a good weekend though, i had five jr. high kids here on friday for a sleep over.  that was fun, but i don't think i'll be doing anything like that again for a little while to come.  the lights finally went out around 3AM, after which i summarily fell asleep.  evidently, however, they didn't actually make it to sleep until a few hours after that.  you know how it is, all of them were afraid of being the first one asleep.  i wake up around half past seven that morning, one of the kids is still up, hasn't been to sleep at all, hadn't been medicated, i'm convinced he could go a week without sleep if he had to.  so anyways i take him on a walk with me to the donut shop to get donuts for everyone.  that was definitely the move, load them up with sugar before i take them home to their parents, which took place between half past ten and eleven.  so anyways on saturday i went down to san diego and spent the night at a cabin down there with some folks from my church.  on the way home, i was pondering examining it as an exercise in self-examination, that and getting a mean driver tan.  so anyways, armed with the ample time that traffic and distance the drive from san diego to long beach combine to provide i thought about how much i've decreased in extravertedness over the past five years or so.  i'm still a mild extravert, which says, more than anything, how extraverted i was then.  i know i've toned down a lot since about the time i graduated high school, and i wonder how much of that is due to the decision i made to be more restrained about stuff like that and how much is due to me becoming more self-absorbed or something like that.  like this weekend, i found myself hesitant to go before i left, but coming back, i was so glad i'd gone.  i found myself feeing the same way after similar stuff not long after i moved out here.  there'd be some sort of event, which in the past, i never would have even given a second thought to, i would have just gone, but then i'd really just not want to go, not even that so much as just feel like leaving my place wasn't worth the effort.  without exception, on the way home i'd be so glad i'd gone, and couldn't believe that i'd contemplated skipping it to stay home.  this weekend was exactly like that.  it wasn't that i didn't want to go, more than anything i was contemplating the challenge it posed to my comfort zone, the challenge wasn't even substantial, and it proved to be more than worth it.  denis leary's getting roasted on comedy central.  feeling: satisfied thinking of: getting a bike music: "time brings change" MxPx

      jorge ramos is my hero.  i s'pose i shouldn't really leave it at that, jorge ramos calls soccer games on radio unica, that's in spanish.  anyways, i was talking to my dad this past weekend, and the gold cup had just finished, mexico beat brasil for the championship in sudden-death overtime and ramos went nuts on the call.  i didn't hear it, my dad did, so he told me about it.  the goal was scored, and he went on for a solid two mintues after that, ending by saying "SOMOS CAMPEONES CABRONES!!!"  for comparison, if a guy calling a game in english said the english equivalent to that, he'd be reprimanded and suspended by the fcc.  i was pretty disappointed that i missed it, but lucky for me i found a clip of it on the web.  it was awesome, and now he says it whenever i turn my computer on.  quite a few people are moving, different circumstances for them all, but in any case, moving can be a royal pain, regardless of the circumstances.  i remember moving out here.  actually moving out here wasn't so bad, mostly because my stuff was already in boxes from having moved from illinois three months before.  i didn't have a room anymore, so i lived in the living room, and i didn't really have any place to unload my stuff, so it mostly stayed in boxes in the garage.  i didn't have just a whole lot of stuff, so pretty much everything i owned was jammed into the back of my car.  bone's moving, and he started a blog, i'll link to it if he says it's ok and if he stops talking about shaving his back.  i won't write tomorrow, mostly because i won't be here, so no update. if i'm not back by sunday avenge my death.  feeling: conflicted thinking of: football, though i don't know why music: "cheating at solitaire" mike ness

      i save everything.  it's quite ridiculous actually.  i've got stuff that no sane person would even consider keeping.  report cards from seventh grade, notes from middle school.  i can't bring myself to erase even the most mundane emails from my inbox.   it's silly really, i seem to be quite a sentimental fool.  maybe that's why i started doing this, sort of to make things easier.  i've always had a pretty good memory, but it's not necessarily comprehensive, i'll remember the most remote details about an event, but some of the other stuff will get lost on me over time, so i figured it might be a good idea to keep track of stuff like that.  the discipline thing was also a bit appealing to me, in that it's something i've never been able to master as far as writing goes.  it's always been very sporadic, i'd write myself an email about something, jot something down on a random piece of paper, but nothing that was ever consistent.   i'd always write that off to being a trait of my personality.  i'm ENFP, and the kind of person that tends to lose interest in stuff that's not immediate, or stuff that i don't feel is meaningful, and after a while, it seems that whatever it is i write ceases to be meaningful.  so i'm sort of working on how to effectively integrate the quest for meaning with the desire to remain self-disciplined.  i think it helps that i've realized that i don't really have to say anything revolutionary every time i decide to write, which is how i felt before.  i was sort of inspired by a quote from c.s. lewis he says    even in literature and art, no man who bothers about originality will ever be original: whereas if you simply try to tell the truth (without caring twopence how often it has been told before) you will, nine times out of ten, become original without ever having noticed it.   that's the quote that inspired the title i use.  i'm not saying anything that's original really, and it kind of amuses me when people seek to be original for its own sake.  nothing i say really matters inasmuch as nothing i say is anything that someone hasn't already thought of, and as long as i realize that all i can do is be honest.  that's helpful.  so anyways, this week is almost over, and i'd be lying if i said i wasn't happy about that.  it's been good, but really long, a couple of 12 hour days, but it's being managed.  i was pretty mentally prepared for this week, and i knew it would be busy, which definitely helped.  technically it was my day off, so i stayed home during the day, ran an errand, finally made it to the post office to send beth her package, so hopefully she'll get it by saturday.  i'm stoked about that.  other than that, katie called today, that was cool, all the stuff for going out there is squared away now which is nice.  now i definitely have something to look forward to.  i added a "comment" link today, someone humor me and comment so i can see if it works.  it'd also be pretty sweet if anyone actually had something to say, but i won't push it.  formatting's been a bit of an issue too, when i open this page, it gets cut off, but then if i restore it down and then maximize it again, the whole page shows up.  is that happening for anyone else?  leaving, before i wear out my welcome.  feeling: a bit tired thinking of: beth, hoping she can get to sleep music: "black and blue" rancid

      i need to go grocery shopping.  shopping is a weird thing for me, partly because i live alone and partly because my refrigerator is nearly completely useless.  i get stuff and if i don't eat it within a few days, it goes bad in my fridge.  i can't really get frozen food, because my freezer doesn't freeze anything, and since i'm the only one here, i can't really count on food getting consumed very quickly because i really don't eat just a whole lot, so a lot of stuff just stays in there.  so anyways, whenever i go grocery shopping, i walk the fine line between getting too much food, and not getting enough and having to go to the supermarket again within the next few days.    maybe this wouldn't be a problem if i hadn't gotten my fridge from a second-hand store.  feeling: ready thinking of: today music: "never for nothing" margaret becker

      happy tuesday.  it is tuesday, isn't it?  i kinda feel like it should be thursday since i was at work til like nine last night, and the only day that usually happens is wednesday.  i have thursdays off, so i get a pretty good chance to recover after a 12 hour day.  this week, however, will be full of days like that because of VBS.  hopefully i can get away for a few hours in the afternoon, so not every day is so long, if i don't i'll be dead by this time next week, and who really wants that?  i think i settled on a flight for my vacation in october.  i'm sort of torn, because if i fly out of LA as opposed to long beach it'll be cheaper, but the convenience that long beach offers is almost worth the extra money.  the airport in LA is 45 mins-an hour from here, and the one in long beach is like ten mins from here, and realistically, the savings of flying out of LA would be negated by the cost of a shuttle or taxi to the airport.  so i guess that makes my decision for me.  i talked to katie last nite tho and pretty much everything seems to be a go.  the only thing i'm waiting on is to figure out if she gets columbus day off or not.  ashley IMed me yesterday while i was at work and said she read here, that was really sweet of her.  she's definitely on the list of people i don't talk to enough.  so today i think i gotta head to the post office today too, sending a package out.  i figure i better send it too, because i got called a ho-bag for not sending it.  i'm not sure i want to be a ho-bag.  feeling: pretty good thinking of: what fabulous guys me and bone are music: "the moshing floor" steve taylor

      i have some pretty sweet friends.  at least i didn't get taken roller-skating this year.  that was just awful, i dunno whose idea it was that time but that was the second worst birthday i ever had.  i mean seriously, who takes someone to a skating rink for their 21st birthday?  i mean it'd be one thing if it was a skating rink that a bunch of outlaw bikers hung out at or something.  lisa called yesterday and we talked about that and how the same thing happened to her for her 18th birthday.  i was at that one too and it was so awful it was actually pretty hilarious.  i got a kazoo yesterday, but that was just coincidence, and not for my birthday or anything.  it's pretty sweet though.  after church some of my kids took me to lunch, that was pretty sweet  bone called this morning, that was pretty awesome of him.  he's going back to dallas next week, and i'm hoping that it's just a temporary arrangement for him, which i'm pretty sure he's hoping himself.  weird stuff's been happening back home, actually for a pretty long time, but it's all coming to a head just here lately.  getting there in december will definitely be different, i'm actually wondering if it would be such a good idea to be there over the holiday at all, as opposed to just the weekend before it.  we'll see.  tell someone you appreciate how you feel about them today.  feeling: jagged thinking of: annie, she's in Mexico right now music: "jagged" old 97s

      yah, so today's my birthday.  i'm 23 today and it feels about like 22.  i have a scrape on my right leg and a bruise on my back, both from softball yesterday, but other than that i'm not in any real physical pain so i don't feel real old or anything like that.  that's kinda funny because i remember when i was a little kid, like five or six that it'd be the year 2000 when i turned 20 and that i'd  never  live to be that old.  when my dad was my age, i was three, and when my mom was 23, i was five.    other than that, i'm trying to book a flight for vacation in october, i'm visiting katie, she teaches kindergraten in north carolina, raleigh, to be exact.  it'll be cool to see her, i haven't since graduation which was well over a year ago.  so far i haven't found anything cheaper than $335, and that's on american.  i looked at southwest and they were a hundred dollars more expensive, which was puzzling.  i guess $335 isn't terrible, but my tickets to chicago last spring were less than $200, on american no less, so i'm thinking i pretty much hit the jackpot that time.    trying not to be busy today.  feeling: contemplative thinking of: august 3-11 1999 music: "at the moment" stavesacre

      i love my couch, i probly should have spent all of last night on it.  at least my apartment is clean.  i've noticed that only seems to happen every once in a while.  it's like the book of judges, you know from the bible.  what would happen there is the israelites would get really really bad, disobeying God, worshipping idols, dirty, as it were, and then right as they were at their lowest low, God would send a judge to bail them out, clean them up, as it were.  my place is like that, it starts off ok, then it gets dirtier and dirtier before i finally decide to fix it, clean it up.  it'll gradually get worse until i decide to clean it again.  i even mopped the kitchen floor.  yah so it's saturday, not really action packed, but that's totally ok with me.  soccer on tv, the mexican league starts back up today, no big upsets this week, at least i don't think there will be, we'll see tho.  the big deal today is that chivas are playing the MLS all-stars, i figure that means absolutely nothing to most of you reading this (does *anybody* read this?) but that's never happened before, should be exciting.  other than that, i got softball today, it'll be the last chance i get to play.  our team's terrible, maybe we'll win today, but then that'd ruin our perfect record.  at least it's a nice day outside.  tomorrow's a big day, if you forgot what it is, shame, shame on you :-)  feeling: sort of useless thinking of: why i can't figure out what HTML code for navy blue is. music: "love, salvation, the fear of death", sixpence

      i actually feel pretty rested today.  it's nice, a good night's sleep, i'd almost forgotten what it was like.  the reverend horton heat show at the house of blues in anahiem is sold out, which is a drag.  their shows are the best live shows i've *ever* been to, and i haven't caught one in a little over two years.  the last time i saw them was at the metro in chicago, great show.  funny story, we got lost on the way home from there, stayed on the 290 too long and ended up in BFE before finding north avenue and taking it all the way to wheaton.  when we got back around four that morning, the house was locked, which was the first and only time it'd been locked that entire summer.  good times.  not much time, i should probably be off in a bit.  happy birthday to liz.  feeling: well-rested thinking of: link music: "no cigar", millencolin

      never lend books to someone you like.  it's not customary of me to give unsolicited advice, but then i'm not entirely sure anyone even reads here anymore, so i don't guess i'm really giving advice as much as reflecting, or something like that.  i was thinking about this yesterday though, i was in a pretty foul mood driving home and for some reason, i got to thinking about books that i owned, but that are not, as of the present, in my possesion.  in fact, without exception, they are hundreds of miles away.  not throwaway books, either, good ones, some of my best ones, in fact, my best one is among those getting the indefinite library treatment, that one, however, i'm fairly optimistic about getting back, the other ones, not so much.  i guess the plus is that whenever they look at those books they'll think of me and feel bad for what theives they are for still having them, well, maybe they'll think of me.  so anyways, i say don't lend books to someone you like, because if you never get the book back from them and subequently lose touch with them you'll be forced, whether you admit it or not, in some way, to hold some sort of negativity with your association of them.  not any sort of petty, childish immaturity, necessarily, more of a disappointed "man it sucks i never got that book back from her, it was a really good book."  i guess how much it colors your opinion of that person is contingent upon your level of maturity.  if you lend a book to someone you don't like, if and when they never get it back to you, then it sort of helps in your justification of not liking them.  i dunno why you'd lend a book to someone you didn't like though.  feeling: patience elapsing thinking of: emily and becky, with my books music: "i wasn't gonna call you anyway" the toasters

      there's a lot to be happy about.  i got a vacation coming up, which i'm ready for, i'd say more than ready if you pushed me, but no one's here pushing me.  it'll be great though.   my last vacation was in march, and that was a while ago, i did take off an entire week that time though, went to chicago, it was even better than i thought it'd be.  didn't take any time off over the summer, mostly because between going home at christmas and the chicago trip in march, i used up my two weeks.  i had no idea it'd go by that quickly.  luckily, however, one of the perks of going into my second year here is that i'll get an extra week.  stuff at home's nuts, so even though i'm sure i'll be going home around christmas, i'm not entirely sure that i'll stick around long enough to actually be there for the holiday, so i probly won't take a whole week at that time like i did last year.  besides seeing my family, which pretty much goes without saying, being the holidays and all, there's a list of a few things that i  have  to do while i'm there; i have to see Laura, i have to get to the SM invite, i have to shoot pool at brad's w/dunx, brad and whoever else shows up, and there's the day me and bone are planning where we have lunch at pancho's, see lord of the rings, then go have dinner at cici's.  i'm anticipating a grease-induced coma after that day, so you might not hear from me for a bit after that.  in any case, it'll be action packed.  the cowboys won yesterday, i didn't get to see the game, but that makes two in a row for them.  feeling: puzzled thinking of: cleaning this place up music: "constellation" the juliana theory

      "balance" is a crutch word.  i petition you for forgiveness right now, because a philosophical rant is forthcoming, which is unusual, but only when considering that it's coming on a saturday afternoon, a time of the week not known for cerebral activity.  anyways, a bit of a primer is probably in order.  a word becomes a crutch word when it meets two critera, 1.) it is used way too often, and 2.) it's used in a context where another word would be markedly more adequate.  a crutch word is different from a buzz word, but the difference lies more in degree than in type.  i've noticed that words i classify as crutch words became crutch words because they were buzz words before.    maybe, i'm going off because i think balance is a stupid word, but then maybe i think it's stupid because it's overused, and subsequently misused.  most of the time i hear it used in some sort of ontological context, attempting to manage any number of intangible entities.  balance has a connotation of equality, it, in fact, presupposes equality.  the trouble with that is that in our lives, more often than not, seeking equality between the disparate intangible entities is not a worthwhile goal, and in fact, is not a goal that is actually sought at all.  we don't want equality, we want things given appropriate priority, if everything was equal, balanced, the resulting disequilibrium would in fact cause more problems than "balance" is ostensibly supposed to solve.    on top of that, using the word in that context leads to compartmentalization.  instead of seeing life as an integrated whole, we learn to see it as disparate parts, and have no problem justifying actions in one part of life that contradict values held in another, it leads to congnitive dissonance, dissonance we often justify based on the idea that the parts are disparate anyway.  perhaps more problematic is the idea that balancing is a solitary act, done solely by an individual.  i've gone on long enough.  feeling: dizzy thinking of: turning the A/C on music: "zzyzx scarecrow" stavesacre

      there are ants in my bathtub.  not many, just when i go in there in the mornings, i see two or three, but that's been the case for a little while now.  i can't figure out why they're there, i've sprayed in there a few times and everything, and it doesn't seem as though there'd be anything in there to keep them coming back, i mean unless they  like  eating soap.  i wouldn't be so puzzled if i saw them in the kitchen too, i mean they're likely to at least find some crumbs there, hanging out in my bathtub, all they get is drowned when i turn the water on.  keeping with bathroom/shower stuff, albertson's doesn't carry my brand of mousse anymore, which sucks because i have to go to walgreen's to get it now, and walgreen's is way more out of the way than albertson's is.  i use condition by clairol, and i'm not at all in the mind of switching, i've used other stuff, and none of i've found to be adequate, i got pretty thick hair.  i thought about calling clairol and ordering a crate of it or something like that, but that'd be weird, and i'm not sure where i'd keep it.  i can get gold bond at walgreen's too though, that's a plus.  feeling: resourceful thinking of: bone, mid-hiatus music: "you found me" MxPx, via the Altar Boys

      i think the muse takes thursdays off too.  nice day off today, didn't do the running around that i've done on thursdays the last couple weeks, so it was nice to just more or less relax.  i slept in til around ten, which for me is quite an accomplishment.  most days i'm out of bed before seven, and on days off, i usually don't make it much past nine before i absolutely have to get out of bed.  i had a torta today, first one in a couple months probably.  i've given up fast food and cut way, way back on junk food, but a torta's not really fast food, although i probably should have eighty-sixed the refried beans on it.  the lil mexican place that i get em from though, seems to be under new ownership, as i noticed some pretty significant changes to the menu.  there was lots more american food, more burgers, and even some breakfast stuff.  it would seem as though they're trying to get a greasy spoon/mexican hole-in-the-wall vibe going.  i'm not sure how i feel about that.   i should be used to it, growing up in texas and all.  feeling: isolated thinking of: having a drink music: "pump up the valuum" NOFX

      i broke down, finally.  not the nervous kind, though i should probably tell that story sometime.  i finally got a new wallet yesterday.  people that have seen my old wallet will understand what a huge step this was.  my old one was loaded with history and sentimental value, i'd had it since i was 15, it was a gift from a church in mexico, but it was worn to the point of complete and utter disrepair, on top of that, navigating it wasn't always easy, i mean with all the stuff an important guy like me carries around.  i got it at target, and i got a few other things too, ended up spending nearly fifty bucks, which is alarming, i don't recall the last time i spent that kind of money at target, and it sort of made me mindful of the fact that i've been spending money like it's going out of style lately, mostly in the last two or three weeks, it's the kind of thing where i'm afraid to look at my account statement or anything like that, even though, that's totally unreasonable, because i haven't spent *that* much money, i mean i haven't bought a car or a put a contract on anybody's life or anything like that.  i did buy a car actually, but it's likely not what you think.  feeling: extended thinking of: my retired wallet and how to preserve it music: "bright side of the road" van morrison

      i'm breaking in new jeans.  if there's something i hate doing, it's that.  right now, i've got this pair of jeans that i've had for at least a year, maybe longer, i think i got them when i was living in dallas, and i'm just now getting to where i'm earnestly breaking them in, and it sucks.  you know how new jeans feel, sort of stiff, not quite like they really belong on you.  i have jeans in my rotation that i've had since junior year of high school, which means that they're six, almost seven years old.  jeans that are that old are so great, they're so comfortable that they feel like flannels.  i can't wear them to work, because of the holes and everything, but i get chances to take em out pretty often.  what i fail to realize though, is that those jeans weren't always in the condition that they're in now.  i don't remember the breaking in process, you know how it is, you think of a certain period of time, and having a desire to recall it fondly, you don't remember all the stuff that happened that really just served to piss you off or make you sad or whatever.  it's like that with my jeans, i just really like the way that they are now so much that i completely discount all the time i spent wearing them before they were sufficiently comfortable, to me anyway.  good jeans are like good friends, you don't want to think about the day you'll be without them.  feeling: betrayed, lightheartedly betrayed, but betrayed nonetheless thinking of: dog food, aka cats music: "we have to figure it out tonight" the beatsteaks

      nothing much going on today.  it's monday and that's probably more a good thing than it is a bad thing.  yesterday was busy, tomorrow will be busy, and wednesdays are always busy.  hopefully, today will go at a pretty relaxed pace, maybe get some reading or studying done, something like that, catch up on email, now  there's  an idea.  i won an ebay auction yesterday, all part of a bigger project that is pretty close to being wrapped up here in the next week or so, hopefully anyways.    more music talk now, i guess.  that rancid cd is really,  really  good, i got to listen to it driving around over the weekend and it grew on me very quickly.  as far as other stuff they've done, i'd compare it to "and out come the wolves" in that it's got mostly catchy stuff, but there is some of the harder stuff that characterized their other cds, they even mixed in some organ and piano, and anytime a punk band can do that, and do it well, it's pretty sweet.  the rangers' season is, mercifully, almost over.  feeling: uneasy thinking of: leaves music: "arrested in shanghai" rancid

      it finally happened.  i've lived in this apartment for a year and today, for the first time, i lost the remote control.  it's not as simple as all that really, just losing  the  remote control.  i have three of them, one for the cable, one for the tv, and one for the dvd/vcr.  the one that's of most consequence is the cable one, it being the one that changes the channel, and that's the one that went missing.  it's such an irritating thing, not the kind of thing that will ruin a day, at least not the kind of thing that  should  ruin a day, but the kind of thing that can drive a person (read:me) nuts.  it was quite pathetic actually, i didn't even want to change the channel, i was just pissed that i couldn't find it.  so i found it a few minutes ago and decided i could sit down and blog.  so anyways, today was a long day.  a good day, and a fun day, but a long day, i showed up at work at around eight, went home for a lil over a half hour for lunch, came back and was summarily pressed into chauffeur duty, then i made balloon sculptures.  it was all good, time well spent, very interaction intensive and i got to spend time with a lot of neat people.  today was also the first day of fall, and the last day of summer.  i dunno exactly what time the equinox was but it was sometime during the day so today was both.  it's like that simpsons where frink is having the garage sale and he says "good morning" to marge, and "good afternoon" to homer and says that the clock struck noon in between both greetings, so technically it was correct.  anyways.  feeling: a bit drained thinking of: driving music: "so long sweet summer" dashboard confessional

      you wouldn't think it'd be this hard.  so i've been looking for a hooded sweatshirt.  not just any hooded sweatshirt, but one that has the word "california" across the front of it.  finding it wasn't something i would have imagined to be terribly difficult, i mean given my current location, the state of california, it's not like i'm in siberia where even suggesting that california existed would warrant a savage beating from your fellow siberians.  in any case, i've been unable to locate one pretty much everywhere that i've looked.  it's part of the impetus behind my having gone to malls on several occasions in the last three weeks or so, but the mall visits have, so far, come up empty (as far as the hoodie goes, i did net the flip-flops from thursday, however).  suggest i look on the internet, and i'll smack you, i swear i will.  i figured if any place should have it, it'd be the athletic website of the university of california, i mean them being the california golden bears and all, but no.  never mind the fact that looking on the internet i could find hooded sweatshirts with at least a dozen other states' names emblazoned on them, arkansas, michigan, illinois, indiana, basically all the states nobody gives two craps about.  adding insult to injury today was when maria IMed me with the following message:  animalkrackers01: GUESS WHAT i was at old navy and they have sweatshirts that say TEXAS  fortuitously i had an away message up, which said:  Auto response from ricv56: for those of you who think i may be unqualified for this position, please take into account that i served two consecutive terms as mr. universe; during which i was technically in charge of the entire universe. --ladies and gentlemen, the next governor of the state of california  maybe that's why i can't find what i'm looking for in this bass-ackwards state that i live in.  i mean it only figures that a state where someone who uttered that quote figures to be the governor would someone have a dilemma like this.  i'm not complaining or anything, maria even said that she'd have gotten me the texas sweatshirt if she had more than fifty cents on her, and that was really cool of her, but then i don't think that means she would have stolen it for me if she'd had more than fifty cents but less than what the thing costs, but that's probably a good thing.  i'll stop now.  i did end up finding one by the way.  feeling: like a pirate, you know, with treasure thinking of: st. mark's football music: "debbie gibson is pregnant with my two-headed love child" mojo nixon

      i read  brave new world  once.  that was the summer before junior year of high school, and to be perfectly honest, i really didn't enjoy readint it at all.  i've never been into science fiction and that's pretty much what it was.  the easiest way to describe it is in relation to  1984  by george orwell.  orwell's book focused on how "big brother" will restrict the level to which people are able to carry out intelligent discourse, rendering them uncritical and non-threatening to the police state in control.   brave new world  was written by aldous huxley and had the same general end as 1984 .  people end up as uncritical, unthinking automata, but the difference is that instead of being coerced or forced into submission by a authoritarian state, the people have put themselves in that position through their desire to be mindlessly entertained.  so anyways like i said, i didn't really like the book, but for whatever reason, the book and the ideas that huxley had in it pointed me in the direction of a lot of stuff that i did enjoy reading and led me to think about what he'd written on a more applied level.  in fact, i feel like reading that book started me on a process that led me to major in sociology.  so anyway, i mention all this because while i was out last night, i was thinking about some of the stuff i'd written on tuesday, stuff about morality and the complexity that colors it, the fact that it's not as black and white as a lot of people want to think that it is.  that whole train of thought, at least this time, started because of a really asenine conversation that i had the night before, one that like reading  brave new world  i really didn't enjoy.  i'd sort of been fighting with myself over what to do with that conversation, because i disagreed pretty vehemently with the person i was talking to, and whenever i do that, once the conversation's over i usually try extra hard to see if i'm wrong, think about what i would say if i were arguing the point the other person was making, but in looking at everything, i couldn't find anything to suggest that i was.  at first, i didn't want to think about the conversation at all, i felt like if i did i'd be giving it undue significance, but having thought about it in the frame of how i think about not just  brave new world  but other stuff that i've talked about, thought about, read, that i didn't perceive as worth the effort, and saw where stuff like that could lead me, the kind of stuff it would lead me to consider and felt like thinking about it wasn't useless or worse.  maybe i would have enjoyed the book more if i hadn't waited til the day before it was due to read it.  feeling: restrained thinking of: what to wear music: "the great american novel" larry norman

      i have fingernails now.  i s'pose i've always had fingernails, but only in the sense that they were covering the ends of my fingers.  i've been a nail-biter since about age four.  i've never considered it a nervous habit, mostly because i've never been a nervous person, more or less just something i've done.  i'm a bit willing to change my mind about that now, or at least relate it to stress and/or uncertainty because i'd stopped before, last year actually, but started again once i moved out here.  so anyways, i've stopped again.  it's been over the past couple weeks or so, i told laura i would, and she said she would too, but we haven't checked up on each other as far as it goes just yet.  i went shopping again today, i'm hoping that it's not becoming a habit, but i went down to los cerritos center today.  got some flip-flops, two pair, we call 'em chanclas in messican, there was a sale, buy one pair get the second half off.  cds too.  new MxPx, it came out on tuesday, and the new rancid which has been out three weeks or so, i dunno what took me so long to finally get it, i got their last cd the day it came out.  in any case it's been a long time coming with both those bands.  i also got a dashboard cd, not the new one, the first one, it'd been on my list for a while, but i'd never gotten around to it, i guess because they've not been on my short-list until pretty recently.  chanclas, hmm, i won't need to wash socks as often.  feeling: pensive thinking of: i'm not even sure music: "the places you have come to fear the most" dashboard confessional

      simplicity,  real  simplicity, lies beyond complexity.  at least that's what i learned in my very first freshman theology class.  in intellectual endeavors, simplicity seems to be the goal, analysing things to their most basic units, to the point of  sui generis  is what is largely sought after.  what i've found in talking to people about an assorted number of things is that people often mistake the simplicity that hasn't wrestled with complexity as a satisfactory simplicity, or perhaps even worse yet, stop prematurely, remaining mired in complexity.  pride creeps in and people taking themselves seriously like they do, they aren't willing to let go of the conclusions they've drawn.  i've noticed that it seems to be particularly problematic as far as perceptions of morality go.  instead of understanding the complexity of what makes certain actions good or bad, i.e. the condition of the heart, people are way more comfortable having a list of things that are either good or bad, good people do the good things, and people that aren't good do the bad things.  that's to say nothing of what determines what is good and what's bad, because what i've observed is that the good people get to determine what's acceptable and they have a penchant for imposing those ideas on those around them.  the prevailing outlook on the part of people who seek goodness through the mere following of rules or avoidance of situations judged to be evil or unwholesome seems to be that goodness comes from self-denial. that is to say that people who are good are good, at least in part because they abstain from activity that is "bad."  so what happens is that a standard of goodness isn't defined as itself, but rather it's only defined relative to what it isn't, which is bad.  thomas merton had a quote that sort of describes the [somewhat] unperceived pitfall of people who think that way, saying:   merely accepted, suffering does nothing for our souls, except, perhaps, to harden them.  endurance alone is no consecration.  true asceticism is not a mere cult of fortitude.  we can deny ourselves rigorously for the wrong reason and end up pleasing ourselves mightily with our self-denial   what we find is that when self-denial and abstention from certain activity doesn't have a foundation, it becomes an end in and of itself, as opposed to a means to the end of becoming a better person.  the result is that people reduce the meaning of good to the mere absence of badness, simple yes, but it's simplicity that comes from oversimplification as opposed to wrestling with complexity.  i never want to be a good person.  feeling: irritated thinking of: what a badass dunx is music: "if that ain't country, i'll kiss your ass" david allan coe

      feliz dia de independencia.  time for a bit of a history lesson, september 16, 1810 mexico declared its independence from spain, which signaled the end of centuries of colonial and imperial rule.  present day mexico was inhabited by several indigenous tribes, the olmec, toltec, maya, teotihuacan, and aztec before the sixteenth century arrival of spanish conquistadores.  the aztecs having established an expansive empire that had conquered and absorbed many of the other tribes, were the dominant group, so when the spanish showed up they decided to focus on toppling the aztec empire.  many of the conquered tribes decided to aid the spanish in their efforts to defeat the aztecs, in hopes that they would be freed from their oppressive rule.  well, you know how it goes, meet the new boss, same as the old boss.  life was equally, if not more miserable for the indigenous people living in the area.  new diseases were brought over, and the epidemics they caused were devastating.  the workload imposed by the spanish also contributed to ridiculous death among the native population.  the indigenous population dwindled from twenty million to just over one million.  the presence of the spanish provided for the emergence of different people groups in the area, most notably the  criollos  who were the mexican-born offspring of spanish parents.  because of their birthplace they were considered a class below spanish born in spain, and as such were second class citizens.  even beyond the line between native spanish and the  criollos , the society was highly stratified and that, coupled with the influence of recent revolutions in the united states and france, as well as the writings of the french philosophes, rousseau, montesquieu, and voltaire, provided the impetus for revolution.  the revolution was planned to begin on december 8th, but the spanish caught wind of the plan which forced the revolutionaries to either accelerate or abandon their plans for war.  so on september 16th, father miguel hidalgo rang the bell at his church in the town of dolores, calling everyone around to fight for mexico's liberation from spain.  the war lasted ten years and culminated with mexico's independence.  father hidalgo is revered today as the father of the revolution and mexican independence.  viva mexico.  feeling: connected thinking of: el grito music: "mexicanos al grito de guerra" the mexican national anthem

      i cut my own hair.  it goes back a while and it's mostly out of laziness.  i've gone to a stylist/barber/whatever once since ninth grade, and that was because i had a formal to go to that night.  the whole thing started when my wrestling coach got sick of my hair and said i was getting a haircut.  i said "i know coach, i'll go this weekend."  and he said "no you're getting one tonight."  so after practice, not even joking, he pulls scissors out of his desk and cut my hair.  he did a pretty good job, too.    so anyways, i got used to getting free haircuts, all i'd have to do is let it grow long enough to irritate coach.  when i got to college, coach wasn't around to do it anymore, so i had to figure out how to do it myself.  well not right away, i could usually hoodwink someone into doing it for me, usually in the bathroom or something like that.  but after a while, i guess the whole thing becamse a bit tiresome, so i was left with no other option but to do it myself.  i mean it was either that or actually  pay  for a haircut, and who really wants to do that?  luckily i got hair that's not too big of a hassle, i can cut it straight across and since it's curly i don't look like a complete tool like the dumb and dumber guys who did the bowl cut thing, or if i do, no one's had the courtesy to tell me.  old man colby probly still gives his sons haircuts, and that scares me more than a little bit.  feeling: somewhat derelict thinking of: wrestling shoes music: "all i want is you" delirious

      i's back.  good weekend, went up to the mountains, past redlands up into the san bernardino forest.  the scenery was beautiful, i haven't had a chance to spend much time in places like that lately, vestiges of urban civilization were definitely present, at least in the form of smog.  the price to be paid for having moutains within two hours' drive is that they hold all the pollution in.  i hiked up to this point, a clearing with a view of pretty much the entire valley, and the only complaint that i might have had about the whole thing was that i wish it'd been clearer, without so much smog.  the retreat was relaxing and it was productive, but i realized that my outlook on reality is far too postmodern to be adequately understood by most of the people around me.  most of the people i deal with, that is to say people that make decisions, are people with backgrounds in business, which, in a lot of ways, is about as far away as you can get from sociology, which is what my degree is in.  it's almost like speaking two different languages, the things valued by everyone are so different just based on the context in which they're educated, the frames of reference so radically different.  i would be remiss if i didn't mention john ritter as well.  he was a sorely underrated entertainer.  i'd watch anything he did before i'd watch that useless jerry seinfeld.  feeling: relieved thinking of: rent music: "i need somebody" chagall guevara

      squeaky got his oil changed yesterday.  for the uninitiated, squeaky is my car, a 1992 nissan sentra with 151K miles on him.  since he's got that many miles on him, he's usually in need of a bit of extra maintenance whenever i go in for an oil change, and at jiffy lube, they're always more than willing to take care of it.  like yesterday, he needed a radiator flush and an engine flush.  i'm always a bit wary when car guys tell me that i need something on top of what i came for, but the radiator flush i knew it was probably time for, the engine flush decision was made when the guy came and showed me the sludge that came out of there.  i guess it's part of the price of having a car with so many miles on it, especially since i want it to last me a while longer.  johnny cash passed away this morning, he was 71.  bono said that every man knows he's a sissy compared to johnny cash.  the emotion and the honesty that characterized his music drew me in like not much else had.  i remember seeing his video for the nine inch nails song he covered, "hurt" i was in tears.  i'm not really sure what else to say about that, but i wanted to mention it.  i s'pose his words would be more adequate than mine.   I love songs about horses, railroads, land, Judgement Day, family, hard times, whiskey, courtship, marriage, adultery, separation, murder, war, peace, prison, rambling, damnation, home, salvation, death, pride, humor, piety, rebellion, patriotism, larceny, determination, tragedy, rowdiness, heartbreak and love. And Mother. And God.   that about sums it up.  feeling: busy thinking of: weekend retreat for work, no blog tomorrow, i'll be back sunday. music: "the man comes around" johnny cash

      rafael palmeiro takes viagra every night.  or so the legend goes.  can you tell there was a ranger game on here last night?  i found it funny when i first heard that viagra had signed up rafael palmeiro to be their pitchman.  i mean the tell-tale mark of a product's cultural significance is when it can find a marquee athlete to shill for it.  viagra seeking out a current athlete for an endorsment, i thought, was curious.  even the oldest active professional athletes aren't usually much older than 40 (39 in raffy's case), and viagra's target demo seems to be significantly older than that, their other most recognizable endorser is bob dole, and he's gotta be pushing four hundred, so it wouldn't seem as though an athlete would be an ideal face for an erection pill.   new links today, two of them.  one is sam's livejournal.  i'm not sure if she wrote about falling down the stairs at school on the first day a couple weeks ago but i'm sure if you ask her nicely she'll tell the story.  she's a neat kid, one of the neatest i've met since i moved out here.   the other is to [cynically] smiling, a blog written by kendall, who i have to confess to not really knowing.  i've been blogging since the end of july, and started reading other blogs at about the same time.  most of the random ones that i've read once, i've not read twice.  kendall's was different, she writes well, and on top of that, she made me blog of the day earlier this week.  there's so much i don't know about advertising.  feeling: productive thinking of: a mission, and the box that's almost complete music: "someone's gonna die" blitz

      it looks cloudy today.  i had an insight driving to work yesterday, at least i think it was an insight, i know i was driving to work.  it had to do with the relationship between the weather and my mood, and it's mostly just speculation.  i've got a reputation as a person who's got a rather buoyant personality.  bone's in the past described it as "a sickeningly sunny disposition."  this despite his assertion that i live(d) in the ghetto and have the "next hitler" as a brother.  on top of that, i tend to have a personality that's pretty contrarian, i don't choose to be different just for the sake of being different, but i seem to relish whenever i contrast from what's around me.   so anyways, it's generally very sunny here.  every day it's sunny, and i dig that, i really do.  if there's one thing that i'll never complain about living in southern california, it's the general climate of the place.  but i've noticed that my mood has seemed to lag a bit, and on the way to work yesterday, i got the feeling that it was because my mood seems to stand out less because of the sunny weather.  grey is one of my favorite colors, i've always liked overcast days, and lately i've been looking out my window in the morning and finding myself disappointed when i'd see a clear blue sky.  when i lived in chicago the sunniness of my mood stood out because the weather there was generally drearier, obviously and especially during the winter when it'd start to snow in december and you'd forget what grass looked like because you wouldn't see it again til sometime in april.  in those conditions, recognizing it was easier, it was like being able to look at the stars out in the sticks, where there wasn't so much light pollution.  it's funny because i don't  feel  like i'm any less happy than i have been in the past, i feel like it has to do with identifying old stuff, famliar stuff in a new environment.  even on cloudy days here, it's bright.  feeling: feminine thinking of: fall music: "bullion" millencolin

      i need an asskicker.  i feel like one of the things that i miss most that i had in wheaton and in dallas is having someone that challenged me on a pretty consistent basis, someone who cracked the whip over me.  don't get me wrong, i'm generally a pretty relaxed person, but i do well on my own, i'm pretty sufficiently self-motivated.  however i also feel like i'm better off when i've got someone, usually someone quite a bit older than me, playing the crusty old man role.  i remember when i lived in wheaton there was a guy i'd talk to, his name was jim, and after every conversation with him, i'd leave completely amazed, totally challenged.  actually one of the neat things about being there was that there was no shortage of people like that to talk to, to get counsel from.  i've been removed from that and find myself really desiring it lately.  when i was talking to katie last week, i was saying that i felt like i have a tons of outlets for my energy, but not as many inlets as i've been used to, at least ones close at hand.  maybe it's self-awareness.  feeling: excited thinking of: annie, she wrote me a letter music: "fools gold" mouthwash

      i'm not sure what to write about today.  i felt like absolute trash when i woke up, that wasn't just a whole lot of fun. i've had my shower, though, so i'm in pretty good shape right now.  today will be pretty busy, the morning is all tied up with stuff, hopefully the afternoon will be a bit less action packed, i'm thinking i'll probly have to run out and do an errand or two though, get some curriculum or something.  i got some really asenine email forwards over the weekend, and what was worse was that some people thought i cared enough about what they thought to click "reply all," so i could read their opinions on the state of quasi-civil religion in the united states.  those emails were actaully more asenine than the forwards, and i actually saw those before the forwards, because i've got my email set up to send forwards directly into my trash folder.  now all i gotta do is figure out how to filter the responses out too.  everybody talks, and people rarely say a word.  feeling: in need of a backrub thinking of: no rest for the wicked, that's what music: "ballad of a lonely man" mike ness

      i've got a nice red color on my face.  played outside today, most of the day spent out in the sun, and like i said, it shows on my face.  that's really the only place i get red, one of the perks of having bloodlines from south of the border.  though if i go barefoot, the tops of my feet burn, which i've always found curious to the point of triviality, but really really irritating as well.  it was a fun day though, played football at the park, something i hadn't done in a long time.  playing pick up football is one of those activities that sort of makes me feel like i'm on stage, playing a role that's not really me.  when i played football in high school, they never really let me touch the ball, being a lineman and all, and since there's no real use for linemen in pickup games, i get to run, throw, and catch, so it's different.  then there's the fact that i didn't really like football when i played in high school, sort of a reluctant, atypical jock i was.  on gamedays i'd always write, "i hate football" on my right palm.  i don't regret playing at all though, despite my seeming distaste for it, and i'm glad i played when i had the chance.  what i didn't want was to not have played, get all grown up and regret that, feel like i missed out on something.  the flip side of getting to play outside and spend all day in the sun that is that it's left me way worn out, and i ended up falling asleep on the couch for the better part of the evening after that.  the best naps seem to be the unexpected ones, the ones where you don't so much lay down to take a nap, but you just kinda lay down on the couch and the nap just takes you.  the flip side of  that  is that i probly won't be able to go to sleep for a while after i want to.  feeling: nap-alicious thinking of: i dunno, some girl, probly music: "find me" margaret becker

      i went to the mall today.  it was great, one of those times that sort of takes you back to that period of time between eighth and tenth grade.  sort of an applied memory, not quite vivid enough to be deja vu, but not so abstract that it feels like it's totally confined to your memory and imagination.  today was one of those days where i was blissfully oblivious to everything, i didn't even really do much people watching, for which i'm notorious.  i did make one observation though, i noticed the hot topic.  that store cracks me up.  if there's any store that just contextually and ontologically has absolutely no business in a mall, it's that one.  at least that's the way it seems at first.  but then you think about what they're selling (corporately homogenized "counter cultural" image) and who they're selling it to (suburban teenagers), and maybe it's a perfect fit for a mall.  i'll have a porchswing and a shotgun, it won't be long now.  feeling: crochety thinking of: abe simpson music: "if it makes you happy" sheryl crow

      i think i'm by myself in the office today.  that's not a huge deal really, "by myself" still means that the secretary is there, and that only two other people aren't there.  one is on vacation this week, the other's day off is today.  i'm pretty much by myself every day anyway, my office is in a different building than everyone else's.  like anything else, it's got its pros and cons, the main pro is that there's no one looking over my shoulder and i have tons of flexibility, the con is that there's only a minimal amount of social interaction.  i think my jersey's coming today.  i hope it does anyway.  i ordered a tigres jersey earlier this week, it's the one they used from last season.  i wanted to get it because they discontinued it and now they're using a really goofy looking jersey, which i totally don't like.  so since it's no longer in use i figured i'd better get one before i can't find em anywhere.    i got a lancer card, i'm stoked.  feeling: a sore right hamstring thinking of: link music: "the f word" hank williams jr., and kid rock

      i cleaned my desk today.  my cleaning habits i find curious.  i'm not a neat freak, by any stretch, but i've noticed that i like to keep my messes localized.  that's relaxed quite a bit now that i live by myself because i think that when i was living with other people, i always realized how irritating it was to step on something that belonged to a roommate, so i didn't want to inconvenience someone else by having to step over or on something of mine.  normally, i get really distracted when i clean up.  going through stuff to get thrown out, i find stuff that's so inconsequential, but somehow peripherally interesting and i spend so much time looking at that stuff, thinking of what it reminds me of that it takes almost two hours to do something simple like clean off my desk.  i had a really good conversation with katie today, definitely the week's highlight.  we talked about stuff we'd never really talked about before and went on for a while.  it was good though, her perspective was really cool to get, it's definitely a friendship that's growing, which is a bit ironic since we seem to be closer now that we live across the country from each other than we were when we lived across campus from each other.  i don't really do countdowns, but there's just a little over a month before i get to see her.  that'll be sweet.  bone's interview went well, swimmingly it'd even seem, and now he's got a decision to make.  i feel sort of torn, mostly because of the location, i'm not sure how i feel about advising him to move to iowa.  in any case, him having a choice to make is better than him not having one.  stick to making tacos. . . that'll never stop being funny.  feeling: sluggish thinking of: the vacuum cleaner music: "today" smashing pumpkins

      sound the alert, more people are disgruntled with the political process.  this time it's taco bell's fault.  generally i steer clear of any political "discourse," call it a character flaw, but this is too amusing to pass up.  so anyway, in california, the law provides for the recall of an executive officer after only a relatively small collection of signatures on recall petitions.  you've probably heard about it, the current governor, gray davis, is a crook, so naturally it's our duty to get him out of office and elect arnold schwarzenegger.    so taco bell's got this statewide "vote" taking place in their "restaurants" where people can make their voice heard through their choices of cuisine.  buy a crunchy taco and your vote goes to arnold.  don't like crunchy or republicans?  then get a chicken soft taco and show your support for the incumbent davis.  customers are getting in on it too, as a groundswell of support for democrat cruz bustamante has led taco bell to match him with the chalupa.  worth noting as well, is that the remaining 133 candidates in the election are singly represented by the grilled stuft burrito, which itself has gotten some 43% of the vote.  as of tuesday morning, schwarzenegger had, through the purchases of crunchy tacos, garnered 54% of the vote, while davis had managed to collect 3%.  the "election" that taco bell's staging isn't even what's funniest about this whole thing.  democrat officials are pissed because they feel that taco bell's rigged the election to favor schwarzenegger, because evidently, soft chicken tacos are twice as expensive as crunchy tacos are.  their belief grows out of the price difference and the fact that crunchy tacos have traditionally sold better than soft chicken tacos.  they've also accused taco bell of being in cahoots with schwarzenegger, citing his ownership of a million dollars worth of PepsiCo stock, PepsiCo being the former parent company of taco bell as well as their current exclusive beverage supplier.  california democratic party chairman art torres says "taco bell should stick to making tacos, not rigging elections."  i'm not sure what's funnier, taco bell's "election" and the subsequent overanalytical pissing and moaning, or the inadverent amusement that comes as a result of hearing a mexican guy admonish someone to "stick to making tacos."  this is taco bell's world, we're just paying rent.  feeling: clean thinking of: gold bond music: "fields of athenry" dropkick murphys

      said a lil prayer for bone this morning.  he's on his way to cedar rapids today for his job interview, i hope it goes well for him, i'm pretty sure it will, he seems pretty on top of things as far as that goes.  he was complaining about the weather in dallas yesterday, and made a comment that iowa didn't have the "emotionally devestating" weather that dallas does, which is just nuts.  i've been feeling nostalgic for the midwest lately, but man, winters there are miserable.  i mean in the heat, it's just the weather that kills people, in the cold, the weather doesn't just kill people, it drives people to kill themselves.  anyways, i just hope he put his suit in a garment bag and not a stuff sack.  so anyways, this week doesn't look too busy, the day off yesterday was nice, i should probly do some laundry today.  lil kids start school tomorrow, and since work is directly, and i mean directly across the street from an elementary school, it's likely to cause all kinds of space issues in the mornings when people are dropping their kids off because it's a rather narrow street with not much room for parking.  there's tons of em, and i know that a lot of them only live a couple blocks away.  it's gotten to the point where it's almost hard to believe that kids that age used to walk to school.  is anyone else irritated that fox is moving boston public to fridays?  feeling: alert thinking of: clouds music: "disconnect" sixpence

      so it's been a year.  it's kind of nuts that i ended up here in the first place, when i started my senior year, southern california wasn't even on the map as far as places i thought i'd end up after graduation.  the drive started a couple days earlier, left dallas around eight in the morning friday august 30th.  the first day was pretty easy, no real rush, i figured on being on the road about ten hours or so, driving through the most cosmopolitan cities texas has to offer.  i mean abilene, midland, odessa, el paso?  that's four potential sidetrips right there.  it wasn't so bad really, west texas has this charm to it that i think only texans can appreciate, so i enjoyed it.  the next day was miserable, pretty much all day the desert, spent the heat of the day crossing the entire state of arizona.  both nights i spent at motel 6's, friday in deming, NM and saturday in palm springs.  it was sunday morning, palm springs is about a hundred miles from long beach, and leaving there at half past seven that morning saw me roll into long beach around nine.  that was a year ago, september 1, 2002.  a  year .  i remember having my lil car packed to the gills with pretty much everything that i owned, coming out here, not knowing a soul, having a job, but no place to live, stuff like that.  i feel so far removed from that now, but at the same time the memory of that is so vivid that perceiving the amount of time that's passed since then is nuts.  time fascinates me, it's so paradoxical.  we always have it, yet somehow there's never enough.  we curse clocks and calendars that move too slowly and then find ourselves shocked by how quickly they change.  i remember reading a calvin and hobbes comic when a few years ago, calvin was talking to his dad about getting older and how people slowed down as they aged.  calvin told his dad that since he'd have less and less time as he got older, he'd want to go faster instead of slower.  i remember being a little kid and thinking that a year was  such  a long time, and how once i got to high school and college, it would seem that i could blink and miss one.  one of my professors in college explained that in a way that made a lot of sense, when you're five, a year is a whole twenty percent of your life, even at age ten, it's ten percent, no small fraction itself.  as you get older, a year makes up less of a fraction of your life, so perceptually, they seem to go faster.  that only explains one side of the paradox though.  it seems to me that the longer you live and the more you experience, the richer, the thicker your experience with time is.  being bound by time and aware of how quickly it passes puts us in a position where we have to reconcile that with trying to fit so many experiences and memories into that framework.  your brain and your heart become so engrossed all that's taken place in the time that's passed, which sort of accounts for those moments where a week seems like a year.  i'm not sure abilene even had an olive garden.  feeling: calm thinking of: FM 1382 between I-20 and US 67 music: "acquiesce" stavesacre

      today, i get paid.  it's a monthly occurance which has its pros and cons, not the actual getting paid part, that's all pro and no con at all.  the part with the pros and cons is the scheduling of the event.  chief among the cons is that it only happens once a month so the rush of endorphins that takes place when the check's deposited is relegated to a mere twelve times a year.  at the top of the list of pros is that it keeps me from spending an exhorbitant amount of money with the false sense of security that a payday is coming up.  in any case, the paycheck always comes on the last weekday of the month, and like i said before, that'd be today.  money, or income more specifically, is interesting.  in what some would call more dignified times, income wasn't something that respectable people talked about, period.  information like that was intensely personal and to be guarded.  these days that's not so much the case.  i mean i won't say how big (or small) my check is right here this second, out on the web and all, but generally if someone wants to know, all they have to do is ask.  there's also a lot to be said for just  getting  a paycheck on a regular basis.  i remember in college, i'd try to limit the time i spent working, ostensibly to focus on school, which for the most part, meant that i didn't have a regular part time job.  i did some work moving furniture for this one guy.  that was pretty awesome mostly because he paid $15 an hour and in cash.  the flip side was that it wasn't regular and when it wasn't busy, i'd have to figure out whether to get groceries or put gas in the car and sneak into the cafeteria on campus that week.  some of you know exactly why the word "ostensibly" is in that sentence about focusing on school.  feeling: black t-shirt and jeans thinking of: st. mark's music: "sick boy" social distortion

      i have a gamecube.  i don't really play it very much, and the decision to get it was actually a pretty involved one.  part of the benefit of having roomates is that usually one of them had a nintendo of some sort, a 64, a gamecube, something like that.  whenever i'd get the urge to play, that is to say whenever i had reading or other homework that i wanted to avoid, the option of playing was available to me, i could play for a lil while and be done with it, and i usually was.  i wouldn't touch it again for at least a few weeks.  so it's been a year and a half since i've had a roommate and it was about january or february that i felt like sitting down for an afternoon and doing nothing but playing video games.  with no roommate, however, the option wasn't readily available so if i wanted to play, i'd have to spend the money to get one myself and i wasn't sure how i felt about that, it'd never cost me money to play before, and i kinda thought it'd be stupid to spend over a hundred bucks on something i'd use, at most, every once in a while.  so anyways, i got one and it's actually come in handy on days off and stuff, but true to form, it's not become a habit at all, but i actually kinda feel like it's been worth it.  anything to avoid constructive activity i guess.  feeling: a chill thinking of: audrey hepburn music: "badstreet, usa" the fabulous freebirds

      i am  so  down with spicy brown mustard.  i wrote a few weeks ago about applied memories, i'd link to that entry, but i'm a bit pressed for time and too lazy to dig it up anyway.  in any case, what i was describing then was the kind of memory that comes to the forefront of your mind as a result of some sort of a catalyst action.  it's more vivid than a regular memory, but not quite full-fledged deja vu.  so anyways, when i was little, i was a  very  picky eater.  somewhat shocking considering the standards i have for what i shove into my mouth these days, i mean sometimes the requirement for edible gives way to merely non-toxic.  anyhow, from the time i was four til i was about eight or nine, the staple of my diet was cheese sandwiches, grilled if i could get it grilled, but if not, it'd always be with mustard.    at home, we only ever got regular yellow mustard, but whenever i'd go to my grandparents' house, my grandmother kept the pantry stocked with spicy mustard, so whenever i'd eat there, that's what would be in my cheese sandwich.  you know how it is when you're a little kid and you go to grandma's house, everything is so different and so much cooler than at home, even if it's not.  so, obviously, the logical progression here is that i would look forward to going to my grandparents' house so i could get a cheese sandwich with spicy mustard.  it's funny because day before yesterday i went grocery shopping and, pretty much on a whim, got some spicy mustard and really felt like i'd totally forgotten how good it was, and even that i'd liked it so much when i was a lil kid.  luckily, however, i never tried it with my grilled cheese.  feeling: energetic thinking of: baking cookies music: "firefly" old 97s

      sometimes having a Y chromosome is tough.  not that i'm complaining or anything like that or pining away for the alternative, though i did use to be a cheerleader and i watch the learning channel, trading spaces, while you were out, stuff like that.  i mean nothing against girls, i dig girls, but the monthlies and underwire bras are enough to make me want to wholeheartedly steer clear of the whole brier patch, as it were, that being a member of the opposite sex is.  so anyways, i was thinking yesterday about gender differences and different conversations i've had with girls that i know and just how as far as perception goes, guys and girls perceive things so so differently.  what i also thought about is just how much i've changed as far as that goes in the past few years.  i've gone from perceiving things in a very androcentric, compartmentalizational way to being more comfortable with uncertainty and not having every little thing laid out.  so here lately i've been fighting with some leftover vestiges of that sort of certainty-dependent outlook, sort of being bothered with the lack of knowledge of the next step of my life.  like in high school and college there was graduation to look forward to and having the certainty of knowing when and how it would end was really comforting, which is something i didn't realize then.  i've been bothered lately by the fact that i don't have the same certainty now as i did then.  not that i don't like what i'm doing or where i'm at, it's just that the sense of the unknown is sort of playing on the small part of me that  needs  to have things laid out like that.  cheerleading??  i couldn't believe it either.  feeling: secure and conflicted thinking of: 24, tonite music: "south of the border" frank sinatra

      california is on fire.  not like i'm on fire, that'd be near impossible for pretty much anybody.  there are, however, raging forest fires to the east and south of here.  what'd  really  be newsworthy is if there were forest fires to the west, i mean since that's where the ocean is and everything.  so yesterday as i was walking towards my car before heading out in the morning, i noticed this layer of ash on everything which sort of made me wonder if there was a volcano that had erupted somewhere around here.    i'd never seen anything like it before, there were no forests in texas or in illinois, at least not any that got set on fire or anything like that, so the whole forest fire thing is a pretty new experience to me, which is funny because i don't even live in the forest.  in any case, everything smells like smoke now, and it's extremely smoky, which i guess makes sense, and i guess dusty.  some people won't go outside without masks, and it's hazy, even more hazy than it usually is, which is saying something because it's  always  hazy around here.  i probably wouldn't have even noticed all this if i hadn't just washed my car last week.  feeling: sore neck thinking of: november and december music: "carefree" the refreshments

      i'm in the market for a jacket.  not that it's really getting cold here or anything like that, but maybe you've seen the jacket i wear most of the time.  it's more of a lined brown shirt that's gotta be about thirty years old.  i got it from my grandfather, who's a total hardass.  i totally dig this jacket, so i'm not really thinking about totally replacing it or anything like that, but being as old as it is, it's definitely worse for wear so i figure i should probably get another jacket to slow down the wear.  you know how it is.  so what i'm looking for is just a black jacket, a light one, there's not much use for a heavy one out here and i remember seeing one i really liked, what's problematic about that is that this was about a year and a half ago, more problematic is that it was at a mall in illinois.  i think it was a kenneth cole, which is cool, not necessarily because i'm a fan of kenneth cole, i don't think i have a stitch of clothing designed by him, it'd be something different for me is all.  but then you know how it is, it's never just about a jacket, not with me anyway.  there's all kinds of other implications, mostly products of a ridiculously integrated education and a somewhat overactive imagination.  i find myself pondering and trying to understand a sentiment like the one conveyed in the adage "clothes make the man" a maxim i've never gone along with.  maybe it's because i wore a uniform in school or that one time i got yelled at for wearing a wrinkled shirt.  but then if i had gone along with it, my identity would seem to change every three days out of seven or so.  i think i'll get some boots too.  feeling: rawk thinking of: kirsten dunst, "bring it on" greatest movie of all time music: "beautiful girl" the gadjits

      if i hear that radio commercial for tommy hilfiger's "freedom" one more time, something or someone will pay dearly.  good gravy, that commercial comes on every ten minutes or so and it's just so stupid.  i mean everything from its use of an old aretha franklin (whose music has the very irritating tendency of staying in the head once it's made its way there) song, to the "testimonials" about how tommy hilfiger's "freedom" led some girl to dump her loser boyfriend or some guy to finally own up to having herpes and go on valtrex or something like that.  perhaps my animosity springs from the fact that i'm already committed as far as fragrance goes.  with the exception of a few months where i used pleasures for men by estee lauder, i've been a devotee of polo sport since about eleventh grade, probably because they don't have dumb commercials like that.    but i digress.  feeling: surly thinking of: ambiguity music: "the sound" further seems forever

      i need a biographer.  i'm not entirely sure what prompted that thought, i do remember that i was in the car when i had it though.  i tend to do my best thinking in the car, which is somewhat unfortunate, because i don't drive nearly as much as i used to.  i remember when i lived in chicago, every once in a while, i'd get up around five and drive to this panaderia (mexican bakery for the uninitiated) in cicero, and it was just as much for the hour or so i'd spend in the car in thought as it was for the stuff i got there.  so anyways, to the point, i think the biographer thing sprung from a train of thought where i was reflecting on how i'm not terribly detail oriented and how it'd help if there was someone i had to sort of cite the details of my life that get lost on me.  on top of that i think lately i've become more aware of blind spots in my life.  not necessarily what they are, or else they wouldn't be blind spots, but that i *have* blind spots, which has always been something i've had difficulty admitting to myself.  maybe i should become a better writer.  feeling: hungry, which is odd for this time of nite thinking of: a lot music: "the warrior" mylon and broken heart

      i went to the grocery store yesterday.  that's not normally something worth giving a second thought to, much less writing about.  trips there have a tendency to be horrendous, mostly because there never seems to be a time where business is slow, and they never seem to have enough people working the checkout lines.  i've pretty much gotten used to that, it helps that, generally, when i go shopping, i'm not really in any sort of a rush.  lately, however, i've been trying to avoid it if at all possible, mostly because all the grocery workers around here are on strike.  there's a lot i don't understand about organized labor, i mean i've heard jimmy hoffa is buried in the endzone at giants stadium.  luckily, however, there is exemplary social commentary on the subject, the vast majority and highest quality of which comes from the mouth of homer j. simpson.  i'm thinking of the one where the teachers in springfield go on strike and lisa mentions it in the living room, hearing about it homer says "lisa, if you hate your job you don't strike, you just go in every day and do it really half-assed."  genius, utter, utter genius.  feeling: ok thinking of: 91º in october, that's what music: "worker's song" dropkick murphys

      i'm rearranging my bedroom.  i'd been told it looks pretty pedestrian, which makes sense, because, in a lot of ways, it does.  my bed was in the middle of the room, with about two and a half feet of floor on either side, lots of pictures framing the window above the bed, some posters, a nightstand, a dresser, and that's pretty much it.  so anyway i moved the bed over to one side, and figure i've got some room to put a lil couch on the other side of the room and a coffee table and probly some shelves for a bunch of the crap that's still in my closet.  all that meant that i got to go to the thrift store, which i tore up.  it was great.  i got a coffee table and some stuff to put on my walls, a landscape that i put over my couch, and a monet poster i put in my hall, both were framed and they look good.  all that was like thirty bucks.    in the end, however, i'm not even entirely sure why i'm doing stuff with my room, i don't even spend that much time in there, mostly just between six and seven hours when i'm asleep.  but then it's sort of a chicken and egg sort of thing, because maybe if it was designed differently, i'd spend more time in there.  the progression i've made over the last few years:  athlete----> cheerleader----> dabbling in design has me wary.  feeling: energetic thinking of: the social construction of reality music: "spanish flea" herb alpert and the tijuana brass

      it's football season.  i haven't really followed it very closely.  in fact, i don't think i've watched a single game from start to finish so far this year, which is curious for a few reasons.  one is because i've got cable this year and i have more opportunity to watch games than i ever have in the past, granted it's usually the likes of utah st. vs. bowling green or something like that.  that, in and of itself is curious, because watching crap teams never seemed to bother me in the past.  when i was growing up, other kids were getting up early on saturday morning to watch cartoons, i was getting up early to watch baylor play rice.  i'm sure my parents considered seeking counseling on my behalf, baylor and rice have both sucked for a  long  time and i suspect that the only people that watch games of either of those teams from start to finish watch them compulsorily, strapped in, "a clockwork orange" style.  i understand the game too, which makes my diminished interest a bit more puzzling.  mostly people lose interest with something because they don't understand the intricacies behind it.  on top of that, i understand it in a way a lot of people don't.  i can explain to you what a cover 2 defense is, the difference between a 3-4 defense and a 4-3 defense, what a fold block is, the zone blocking scheme.  why teams run running plays (this one's for bone), for example, is more than just one fellow running headlong into a convoy of beefy gentlemen.  most running plays are designed to gain four or five yards.  there's the center, he's the guy whose virility is, quite literally, in the quarterback's hands, the guys on either side of him are called guards.  look, for instance at a trap play, on that particular play if it's being run to the right, the guard to the right of the center doesn't touch the guy right in front of him, but goes to get a linebacker instead, usually the guy over the center, the center gets the guy to the left of him, the guy lined up over the  left  guard, whose job it is to come down the line and destroy the guy the right guard didn't touch.  that opens up the hole for the running back to go through, a hole that's usually open long enough to get four or five yards.  it might not stay open quite as long, causing the aforementioned pile up of beefy gentlemen, or it might stay open a bit longer than that and if the back hits the hole fast enough, leads to a big gain.  that was incredibly boring, that's probably why i don't watch anymore.  if you made it this far, let me know, i'll arrange for a prize of some sort.  feeling: loved, keep it coming :) thinking of: sid music: "press on" billy sprague

      out of the overflow of the heart, the mouth speaks.  or so i've heard.  so i was feeling sort of bad for myself earlier this week, not quite self-pitying, but definitely bordering on it and definitely not the sort of encouraged attitude people associate with me.  mostly i was just sort of wallowing around in a mood that was definitely not characteristic of me, an antic disposition, if you will.  it was weird, because what i was feeling was pretty substantive, but at the same time, i had this suspicion that the feelings i was having came mostly as a result of me projecting stuff on other people that just wasn't indicative of reality.  i got sort of sick of it after a while, and started to realize that what i was perceiving wasn't really reality at all, and that i didn't really like the feelings i was having either.  so anyways, i prayed.  what i asked for was simple, that i wouldn't get caught up in insecurity, which was fueling the feelings i was having and that i would perceive reality accurately, based on stuff that i  knew  to be true, as opposed to stuff that i just suspected based on insecurity.  now i don't want to get into a diatribe about the efficacy of prayer or anything like that, that's not really the story and it's definitely the sort of thing that stirs up some passionate convictions, or at least some passionate apathy, and on top of all that it's not really my bag anyway, the whole opinionated diatribe thing.    self-pitying feelings are a weird thing in and of themselves, they're the scourge of many people's existence, but they're the sort of thing that, at the same time, defines those same peoples' existence.  what i mean is that i've noticed that people whose lives are characterized by self-pity would have no idea about how to live should those feelings be stripped away from them, that despite all their articulated wishes that they could be rid of those feelings, they'd be sorry to see them go.  that's not to merely paint in broad strokes, i know that's not the case for everyone who deals with self-pity and related emotions, but i've seen enough to be aware that situations like that aren't rare.  i didn't understand the reluctance to let go of those feelings until sometime earlier today, when i'd realized that i'd gotten exactly what i'd prayed for and then wondered where those feelings went, and then sort of wished, for a moment, that i could feel cruddy like i did earlier this week.  it's funny, because when i asked for what i did, i didn't even really stop to think about whether i  really  wanted it or not, and what i've come up with was that the desire that i articulated was more or less characteristic of my personality, what's in my heart, if you can go along with that.  i won't say anything about cognitive dissonance, not today anyways, but i do have some pretty amazing friends.  feeling: free thinking of: conversations from today music: "you're not alone" MxPx

      ok, i'm over it.  i think i'm over it anyway.  i've spent this week getting over the most ridiculous case of jet-lag ever, not really ridiculous because of its severity or anything, it wasn't really severe at all, more of a nuisance than anything else.  i think i adjusted too quickly or too well to being on a schedule three hours later than i was used to, pretty much every morning i was there i was up before 8 local time, which was before 5 as far as my body was concerned.  so anyways, i get back and find myself waking up around 5 every morning this week without the ability to roll back over and give the act of awakening the finger.  case in point, yesterday, my day off, i was awake and out of bed by half past six, mostly because staying in bed just didn't feel good.  it was like that simpsons where homer is trying to eat that 12 pound steak and after getting about halfway through it can't possibly eat any more of it, and laments to himself "awww there's food in front of me, but i don't want to eat any. . .ahhh i've become everything i've ever hated!!!"    vacation pics should be up soon, pending approval.  feeling: more or less normal thinking of: i dunno, i'm taking suggestions i guess music: "to have and have not" lars fredriksen and the bastards

      every once in a great while, something unbelievable occurs.  to be honest, i'm drawing a blank as to the best way to articulate what exactly it is that i mean.  it's not the sort of thing where you remember where you were when something happened, like when that murderer o.j. was being chased by the LAPD in his white bronco, i remember i was with my dad getting bbq at hardeman's in west dallas.  now  that  was some good brisket.  this, however, was something entirely different.  have you ever had the feeling when you walked into a place that your very perceptions of reality were being challenged simply by being in that place?  it's as though the place you're in is, by nature, an ontological impossibility, sort of like trying to perceive arriving in heaven before being adequately prepared to do so.  so to the point, i went to target today.  now you're probably all pissed off thinking "he went through all that crap to say that he went to target?!?!  what a schmuck, i went to target this morning and some bratty kid stepped on my foot."   in my defense, however, this was not at all an ordinary target.  this was target in lakewood, california, a target whose grand opening took place just this past week.  they've been advertising its opening for like a year, it seems like pretty much as soon as i got here last september i'd heard about it.  everyone's been to target, there's nothing really special about it, even thinking about this one opening, the only thing i really thought was that it'd be nice to have one on the way from home to work and back, i had no idea it'd be what it was, two stories, i'd never seen a two story target before, an escalator for the carts, it was nuts.  it reminds me of the mcdonald's that opened down the street from st. mark's when i was around eighth or ninth grade there.  kinda like target, everyone's been to mcdonald's and the experience, after about age 8 is really nothing surpassing mundane.  i mean once ronald mcdonald stops being scary, he just starts being creepy, but anyways, this mcdonald's was s'posed to be upscale, like the kinda place you take your date before the prom.  it had fancy chandeliers and tartan wallpaper, not even joking,  that's  what this target was like, like the mcdonald's with tartan wallpaper.  it wasn't long before we turned that mcdonald's into a post morning-workout venue for breakfast burrito binges.  feeling: better, though fighting insecurity thinking of: katie and my dad, they called me tonite, it was great music: "house of the rising sun" cream

      if you need to head to the bathroom, get a drink, or take a smoke break, it's probably best to go ahead and do it now, we're likely to be here a while.  the muse is a flighty young thing, coming and going as she pleases.  i won't go as far to say that she's flaky, that might piss her off, and who really needs that?  but given that there's tons on my mind and i haven't written in almost a week plus her tendency to come and go, it was sort of incumbent upon me to take note of some of the stuff i was feeling and thinking about, which i had plenty of time to do, what with spending all day on airplanes.  i got back yesterday afternoon around half past one local (pacific) time after having gotten up at about half past five eastern that morning.  such a long day, and like i said, way too much time was spent in airports and on planes, about ten hours, in fact.  i do ok with it for the most part, it's not a fear or anything like that, but i get restless; really, really restless after long enough and yesterday wasn't any exception.  i did have a good book to read and tons on my mind, which helped the time pass.  i don't suppose i really have to say that my trip was awesome, it was.  good company has a way of refreshing me in ways that i'm not aware that anything else is able to, and i was definitely in good company.  katie and i go back a ways, all the way to freshman year of college, about five years ago, which is as long as i've known all but a couple or three of my friends.  we were pals in geology class which was always a thrill-a-second affair, especially that day we walked into class and the professor said that we were gonna spend the day looking at sildes of dirt, after which we summarily looked and each other and said "yah, let's go to lunch."  it was a relaxing weekend, but definitely very emotionally loaded, i won't go into much detail, anyone that needs to know already does.  there's such a high in reconnecting with a friend, especially one like katie.  i realize that i've either already started to or am about to sound at least a bit sappy, which is frustrating because it seems (to me anyway) to take away from the reality of sincerity, but i feel like friendships like this are rare.  there's all the stuff that should be there, the thoughtfulness, the sincerity, the giving, everything, but what separates a friend, a true friend, from a good acquaintance is when that kind of a relationship is sustained either over time or distance or both.  thoughtfulness and sincerity and giving seem to me to at least have the ability to appear quickly.  love, however, takes longer to grow and when i look at a friendship like this, love's had the time to grow, and i feel like it definitely has grown, and characterizes it.  sometimes it feels like the words are all i have.  maybe that's why i write notes, and even then, i'm not sure that they can adequately convey the purity of what i mean and what i feel.  i've found that usually someone else is better able to say what i want to say and that they've already said it, this is one of those times, and for once, it's not even c.s. lewis, i promise. :)  this one's from frederick buechner, he says:   your life and my life flow into each other as wave flows into wave, and unless there is peace and joy and freedom for you, there can be no real peace and joy and freedom for me.  to see reality--not as we wish to see it, but as it is--is to see that unless we live for each other, and in and through each other, we do not really live very satisfactorily; that there can really be life, only where there really is, in just this sense, love.   he's right.  feeling: transparent and in need of affirmation thinking of: emotion, sin, inadequacy, blue, words, communication, friendship, rareness, purity, sweetness, joy, sincerity, love music: "every new day" five iron frenzy, "blue eyes crying in the rain" willie nelson, "sunday morning coming down" johnny cash, "kite" U2, "world full of hate" dropkick murphys, "don't walk away" MxPx

      sunday is laura's birthday.  i won't be here sunday so i'll mention it now.  me and laura go way back and i'm gonna tell the story of how we met, mostly because we seem to rehash it every other month or so, and it'd be nice to have around for posterity and stuff.  so anyways, a few years ago i used to work at a camp, back when i spent summers in texas, i was on the rec staff, which was always the busiest group at this camp, busier than the counselors and probably even the kids.  we were the first ones up and the last to bed every night, mostly because we were in charge of all the games and stuff like that.  one of the things i got hoodwinked into doing was sitting outside the cafeteria selling t-shirts.  i was bored out of my mind, sitting there, selling t-shirts, and it was then that laura showed up with some friends and kept me company and made the afternoon passable, more than passable actually, enjoyable.  so you know how it is when camp's over, you sign everyone's t-shirt and you'll probly never see them again, and that's pretty much the way it was.  the next year, i had a job at 7-11, so i didn't get to work at camp again, but it wasn't that far outta town, and i had friends that were on staff still, so i went to visit that same week the next year and saw her and her pals who rescued my afternoon the year before, which was totally unexpected.  they wanted me to sign their shirts, but weren't gonna get em til the next day, by which time i'd be gone, ostensibly to work on another intellectually challenging project for the good folks at 7-11, and those were the days when i carried a camera around in my car, so i said how's about we take a picture instead, you can give me your addresses and i'll send it to you.  so that's what we did, and when i sent laura the picture, she wrote back, and then i wrote back, and then she wrote back, and then i wrote back, well you probably get it by now.  that was three years ago, and being a pack rat like i am, i have a lil box with letters from her in it.  there's like twenty of em in there, that's really cool, because in all that time, i've not really written real-life snail-mail letters to anyone else, and whenever i did write people back and forth before, none of them lasted that long.  i've only seen her like a handful of times since then, but i really feel like she's one of the best friends i have.  happy birthday laura.  feeling: fabulous thinking of: laura, airport fun today music: "i'm ok, you're ok" MxPx

      california has a new king.  let's be honest though, you can find all kinds of banal musings with self-important crap political analysis in a gazillion other places, my banal musings are proudly bereft of self-important crap political analysis.  seriously, i got way more important stuff than that going on, the first item of which you probably noticed if you were here yesterday, which is the new design.  i'm quite fond of it, and the good folks at maystar, i guess that'd just be may, are to thank.  like i said, i like the design, but i'm considering an alteration of the color scheme.  so here's what i would much appreciate from friends, acquaintances, enemies, and random passers-by, opine through the comments link as to 1) whether i should change it at all, and 2) what i should change it to.  i talked to lisa last night and that ripped, talked about slurpees, the quality of accomodations in backwater towns in arkansas, and all kinds of other fabulous stuff.  it was great.  she's the home of the Dorey Story, a new link, added yesterday.  it's a blog worth reading if only for its views on the dutch.    today'll be busy, i'm leaving tomorrow, the long awaited north carolina trip to see katie, so, naturally, there's packing and a bunch of errands to run and loose ends to tie up before i head out.  i'll probably write one more entry tomorrow morning, before my 7AM flight (no idea what i was thinking) won't be blogging while i'm gone, don't perceive that i'll be around a computer, and even if i was, it'd still be vacation, but i digress.  in any case, i won't be back til tuesday afternoon, so think fondly of me.  i think it's safe to go to taco bell again.  feeling: action-packed thinking of: packing music: "jaks" u.s. bombs

      i had an epiphany yesterday.  looking through previous blog entries, i see that i haven't opened any of them with that sentence, which i find somewhat curious because it seems to happen on a semi-regular basis and it occurs periodically in my regular patterns of speech.  i think it was a girl that prompted this one, though right now i can't adequately remember the context or anything like that.  so anyway, i was pondering my preferences as far as girls go, because you know how it goes, guys dig certain kinds of girls, blondes, brunettes, redheads, well-endowed ones, ones with green eyes, long legs, full sets of teeth, what have you.    so i started thinking about girls i've dated in the past and noticed that, beyond the two X chromosomes (and the full set of teeth), there was no real common denominator.  i think a blonde girl in the supermarket is what spurred the revelation i had, because i began to contemplate the stereotype that latino guys dig blonde chicks to the near exclusion of anyone else and started to wonder if that was, at least subconsciously, true for me as well, and i came to the conclusion that it wasn't necessarily the blonde hair that did it, more than anything else, it was fair skin.  now this is rife with all kinds of social and cultural implications.  i tan pretty easily, so my skin is a shade or three darker than most everyone i come into contact with.  does my attraction to girls with fair skin represent some kind of unconscious self-loathing buried ridiculously deep within my psyche?  is the the right side of my body, lighter because of driver tan on my left side, trying to gain outside support in an attempt to gain dominion over the left (dominant, i'm left handed) side of my body?  someone somewhere had to have gotten a grant to do some research on this.  there's some election today, make sure you make it to taco bell.  feeling: obstructed thinking of: lunch, a week from today, with bone music: "hunk o' burnin love" elvis presley

      renewed a friendship last nite.  it was nice.  the whole thing started when i got home and saw the following message on my AIM: CUBS WIN!!! WE ARE THE BEST!!! LOOK OUT MARLINS!!!  it was from sarah, now i hate the cubs, but love sarah, so i was feeling pretty conflicted.  i'm not sure that i fear the cubs winning the world series, hmm, after thinking about it for a second, i'm pretty sure i do, that would be the  only  thing that would even have a chance of overshadowing the bears' win in the 85 super bowl.  that in and of itself is nuts, i mean it happened like twenty years ago, but when you cross into the city limits, you'd think that it'd happened the week before.  i'm convinced there's gotta be more than a few churches that have a portrait of ditka in the place the cross normally occupies.  but i digress, and it was really good to talk to sarah last night, she's one of those friends that i feel like i grew up with, because in a lot of ways, i did.  i knew her when i was in college and i'm pretty sure i did more growing up in four years of college than i did in the 18 years previous to that.  she's in college now and doing well, which makes me happy, and i think the conversation we had did us both tons of good.  i wasn't kidding about ditka.  feeling: pressed for time thinking of: layovers in dallas, thursday and next tuesday, anybody wanna have lunch? music: "busted afternoon" old 97s

      i cleaned up yesterday.  not much, but it was a big job.  the garbage disposal has ceased functioning, and i'm not terribly vigilant about what goes down the sink now that it can't be destroyed with the flick of a switch.  so anyways, whenever i was washing the dishes, i noticed that the sink was draining really slowly, so curiously, i put my hand down the drain to see what was up.  what i found was pretty unamusing, i felt a pretty gross layer of sludge underneath there.  i guess at that point that i felt an opportunity to prove my domestic prowess to myself, an endeavor in which i was greatly aided by liquid plumr.  clearing the whole thing out took about a half an hour, flushing the thing with hot water, dumping liquid plumr and disinfectant down there.  finishing the project brought a sense of accomplishment that felt slightly foreign, i didn't want to do anything else all day.  i'm not sure what about it was so different than finishing any other task, maybe it was because i did end up affirming my domesticity, and busting up a gender stereotype, something i quite enjoy doing.  i'm not sure.  on an unrelated note, don't buy all the suffering crap, the only thing worse than a cubs fan is a yankee fan, and even then, it's a toss up.  feeling: neglected thinking of: the surprise music: "zero" smashing pumpkins

      i'm pondering freeway nomenclature, specifically interstate highways.  i was driving around, doing so in southern california gives you  lots  of time to ponder stuff like this, and got to thinking about freeway nomenclature. well, not nomenclature, as such, generally stretches of highway are named for people significant in local history, and numbered based on which way they travel.  pretty much everybody knows that odd-numbered highways run north-south, and that even numbered ones run east-west.  so i guess what i'm exploring is more the way roads are referred to in the vernacular of the regions they serve.    i've lived in dallas, chicago, and now los angeles and each place refers to its freeways differently.  each place, to be sure conforms to the guidelines mentioned in the paragraph previous, but significant variations remain nonetheless.  in dallas, everyone generally uses the numbers.  giving directions you'll tell someone "head south down 35, and then west on 20. . ."  the highways have names, but they're not really uniform.  for example, a stretch of 30 is named "r.l thornton freeway" but thornton isn't confined to 30, as a stretch of 35 is also named for thornton.  as if that wasn't confusing enough, once 30 leaves the city limits of dallas, it becomes "the old turnpike," i guess that's appropriate since it used to be a turnpike.  in chicago, the locals  never  use the numbers when referring to the highways, in fact, i'm not even sure they know them.  newcomers and tourists face a pretty steep learning curve when they first show up.  chicagoans are, next to texans i'm convinced, the most welcoming people on the planet, but asking for directions from a local, despite their gregariousness, is no help when you figure out that you have to decode everything they said, turn the names into numbers.  this was pointed out to me, oddly enough, by my new testament professor in college. chicago differs from dallas in a beneficial fashion, however, in that names for the roads are at least uniform.  the 294 is the tri-state, no matter where you are on it.  same goes for the 290, which is the eisenhower, or the ike, and every other interstate highway in and around chicago.  so once you learn the names, it really is easier that way, which makes forgetting the numbers they correspond to if not excusable, at least understandable.     los angeles is sort of a composite of the other two.  the numbers and names are used at least somewhat interchangably, and the names are more consistent than dallas', but less so than chicago's.  it seems, in some cases, as though a highway's name is contingent upon the direction a person is heading on it.  for example, the 405 heading north is the santa monica freeway, turn around and go the other way, and suddenly it becomes the san diego freeway.  on top of that, traffic in the area has been known to inspire ridiculously inane blog entries.  i'm dizzy, i'll stop.  feeling: a bit of a headache thinking of: box filler music: "make sure i'm out screwing up" wesley willis

      waiting for the muse.  perhaps i'll start without her.  waiting, everybody waits.  we complain about waiting, say how much we hate it, stuff like that.  it seems as though we're getting to the point where every new invention or technological innovation that comes next is devoted to diminishing or even abolishing time spent waiting.  i suppose that's why people started inventing stuff to begin with.  advances in technology, by their very nature, socialize us to hate waiting.  part of that, i think comes because we're overprogrammed, we're a culture that values activity to the exclusion of pretty much everything else.  that's to say that if we're not in the middle of doing  something  we don't perceive ourselves to be doing anything of value.   i don't mind waiting so much, having an active imagination helps.  maybe i should qualify that, i don't mind waiting in the micro sense of the word.  i get frustrated with lines sometimes and traffic is a nuisance, but other than that, it doesn't bug me a whole lot.  some of the best advice i ever got was from when i worked maintenance.  it came from a crochety old carpenter named billy who constantly told me "now don't be in no g*ddamn rush, boy."  i'm pretty sure that he didn't intend for it to be the kind of advice that i'd carry through life, mostly i think he just didn't want us to finish a project so quickly that we'd have to start another one, so it's funny that i've held on to that.  waiting in the macro sense is more difficult in that i'm not sure what it is i'm waiting for, and that's where billy's advice gets the most mileage.  if i  was  in a rush, i'd be rushing towards nowhere, that's where i'd be.  it's a significant temptation, despite the laid-back state of my personality, i crave the security of certainty, even if it's false, even if it's an illusion.  c.s. lewis talks about people headed in towards nothing or headed towards an illusion and how people so differently perceive progress in a situation like that, how people can get to believing that progress can only come through moving forward, even when rushing closer to something that might not even be there, or to a wholly unknown destination.  in that context, the most progressive person is the one who turns around to backtrack first, which is counterintuitive to how we perceive progress.  we think, pretty much unequivocally, that some motion is better than no motion, meantime, we become afraid of solitude and terrified of silence, unable to relate to ourselves, and as a result, each other.  tell the muse to let herself in, there's whiskey on the counter.  feeling: fresh thinking of: val kilmer's doc holliday in "tombstone" music: "me and paul" willie nelson

      autumn is coming.  i guess it's here technically, but the last day or so it's started to show up in a way more tangible than on the calendar.  it seems as though i first noticed that last night.  yesterday was a long day, wednesdays always are, and i got home around ten last night, after a stop at baker's square, which was about as necessary an amenity as there ever has been.  but anyways, normally when i get home, i open up the blinds, and if it's closed the living room window.  so anyways, after a while, the breeze became just a bit to nippy for my liking and i shut the window.  i'm not sure how i feel about that because, having lived in chicago, at no point should weather in long beach faze me, there's no reason for that.  but then i got to thinking, even when i lived there and walked around when it was twenty degrees outside, i was pretty adamant about it being somewhat toasty inside, so i don't guess it's as big a deal as i initially felt it might be.  i also can't get away from the reality that if i stay here long enough, my blood will thin out and i'll wear a winter coat whenever it dips below 60.  i don't even think i have a winter coat right now.  feeling: mostly adequate thinking of: soup music: "the party in your head" the reverend horton heat

      some days i wonder what i'll be like when i'm grown up.  for some reason, i get the feeling that i'll always wonder that, regardless of how much older or even more mature i get.  when i was real little and people would ask me what i wanted to be when i grew up, i'd tell them i wanted to be a firetruck, maybe i just thought it was a cool word because it started with an f and ended with a u-c-k.  in any case, i wouldn't be deterred, when people said "don't you mean a fire man ?  i'd say, "nope, i wanna be a firetruck."  later i learned that i couldn't be a firetruck, and that the task of becoming one would require some sort of perverse pinocchio process where i would turn from a real boy to an inanimate object.  i didn't want that, so i changed my mind, i changed it more than a few times, most people do.  when you're a kid growing up is funny, because you think that once you do, you'll somehow have everything you need figured out figured out, that somehow life will be infinitely easier than it is at the present.  i remember being ten or eleven and wishing that the next morning i'd wake up and be twenty-one, like in that awful tom hanks movie, i'd say the one where he plays a retard, but that wouldn't narrow it down any.  it's probably the perception of autonomy that's the huge draw there.  what's so paradoxical, at least as far as i can tell, is that with wisdom comes the sense that, even though we gain more knowledge, learn more, the more we learn, the more we become aware of the magnitude of what we don't know.  i think it was jaws, the hanks retard movie, that is.  feeling: temporal thinking of: october music: "into the great wide open" tom petty and the heartbreakers

      i used to wrestle.  after that sentence, this entry could go in any of about a thousand directions.  i could talk about the time that our coach pulled a few of us aside after very unacceptable losses and questioned our possession of male genitalia, or that time i lost eleven pounds in thirty hours, or that time on a road trip one of my teammates was so trashed that he told a convenience store attendant who refused him service because he was barefoot that he was wearing shoes that were simply invisible.  i s'pose it's like that when you start to talk about something that was such a big part of your life for so long.  you  wish  i would talk about all that stuff, cause right now all i'm gonna talk about is my bum knee.  sophomore year i didn't play football, i'd had enough by then, what with after playing in seventh, eighth and ninth grades, so i did preseason wrestling instead.  i figured it would be helpful, being in wrestling shape was way different than being in football shape and no small fraction of the first few weeks of the season was devoted to the adjustment.  it went well enough, i felt like i had a pretty nice head start on the season, so there weren't any complaints as far as that went.  but then the night before our first match of the season, i tore up my left knee in practice.  it wasn't anybody's fault really, we were going live, and someone fell into my knee from the left and forced the joint inward, toward the other knee.  anyone who is aware of basic anatomy likely knows that the knee joint isn't a mutildirectional joint like that, so when it happened, i heard a loud crack, the sort of crack that makes you wish that maybe you'd just joined the chess club or maybe devoted your time to being a better student instead of doing a sport.  it wasn't serious, not as knee injuries go anyway, just a slightly torn ligament, the MCL.  i didn't have to have surgery or anything like that, the most intense procedure i had to endure was an MRI.  despite the lack of severity, however, my knee gives me old man powers.  you ever talk to an old guy on a cloudy day and hear him tell you that it's gonna rain because he feels it in his bones?  besides being creepy, they're like  always  right.  i can do that now too.  it's nuts.  even on days that are a bit cloudy and cool, my left knee seems a bit more sensitive than on other days.  it also creaks and pops a lot, which surprises a lot of people, i guess mostly because i'm not old enough to have stuff that creaks and pops like that.  i figure by the time i'm 26, i'll have a cane.  feeling: gimpy thinking of: lunch music: "the chicken cow" wesley willis

      sunday i wrote about jfk.  i didn't really want to, and it probably showed.  that entry seemed to be thrown together pretty haphazardly, mostly because i really wanted to use the "los homeboys" line and the whole present-day assassination deal seemed like it would be the easiest thing to work it into.  in fact, the whole wall-to-wall coverage ordeal nearly drove me to madness last week, and i pride myself on my ability to remain fairly oblivious to what passes for current-events and the commentary lavished upon it (them?)  in any case, november 22, 1963 was big for a reason more significant than the kennedy assassination, i mean seriously, the guy was from boston, i've met one person from boston that didn't generally irritate the hell out of me and even then conversations with her sometimes made me want to chew my leg off.  clive staples lewis, however, wasn't from boston and, in fact, shares november 22, 1963 with kennedy as the day they left the building.  some would argue that c.s. lewis' influence on present day culture reaches farther and penetrates deeper than kennedy's.  half the population of this county can't answer the question "where were you when kennedy was shot?"  i can't even say i was a gleam in my father's eye, my dad was three when it happened, plus i don't really want to think about my dad's gleaming eye.  the landscape of pop-culture mythology has changed so much, it's pretty much in a constant state of flux, that, to young people coming of age today, jfk's assassination is just that, a piece of popular mythology.  i'm not unbiased, there's not really any doubt about that, lewis' work has had a bigger influence on me than anything else i've encountered in my education save living, breathing people, many of whom have themselves been influenced by lewis.  you don't have to take my word for it though, "the chronicles of narnia," lewis' landmark work ranks #65 out of tens of thousands on amazon's sales list, which is pretty remarkable considering that they're over a half a century old, take that for what it's worth.  dropkick murphys are from boston, and that's  almost  enough to redeem that entire useless town.  feeling: industrious thinking of: lgb music: "forever" dropkick murphys

      thankgiving is thursday.  i have to work this week, at least through wednesday.  thursday's the holiday, friday i get off as well, it's a paid holiday, which is nice, since i get jobbed out of days off/holidays later this year.  my regular day off is thursday, i've probably mentioned that before, and this year both christmas and new years fall on thursday, i'm not sure it'll be a huge deal though, i don't think i'll use up any more than three or four vacation days going home anyway.  it's mildly irritating, having to think about vacation days and stuff like that.  when i was in college, we'd only get wednesday-friday off for thanksgiving, and i heard that until a couple years before i showed up there, they only gave thursday and friday, which struck me as odd, since it was a private school that had students from all over the country, as opposed to a state school that drew regionally where it wasn't such a hassle for kids to get home.    in any case, i never stuck around for those two days of class the week of thanksgiving, i'd always go home the weekend before and take the whole week.  being able to do that was cool, i was usually pretty disciplined about not missing class to that point and figured that taking those two days off would be my reward for not cutting any class up to that point in the semester.    being at home on the monday before thanksgiving watching the price is right beat the smack out of listening to a social theory lecture, hearing about the theoretical implications of george mead's or thorstein veblen's research.  feeling: inadequate circulation thinking of: turkey, i guess music: "southbound" MxPx

      yesterday was big.  at least as far as historical significance goes, that's what i hear anyway.  so it was forty years ago that kennedy got offed in downtown dallas.  i remember being a lil kid and reading all kinds of stuff about him, i guess it was sort of a big deal given that i spent my formative years in dallas and it's sort of a big deal there, my grandmother and an uncle of mine were actually there that morning.  elementary school classes take field trips to the sixth floor museum, i never went actually, they didn't construct the museum until i was in high school.  by the time i developed any sort of an interest in it, it'd been twenty five years since the whole thing had happened.  not being alive at the time, i have no idea who would have done it, i hear a guy named lee harvey oswald did it.  suffice it to say that if a president was killed in downtown dallas today, nobody would be talking about all these CIA, FBI, mob and Castro conspiracies, they'd be looking for los homeboys or something like that.  feeling: uncertain thinking of: rocks music: "bales of cocaine" reverend horton heat

      wheaton college can dance now.  well, they're no longer forbidden from it anyway, whether they actually have the ability to do it or not is likely another thing altogether.  in any case, last weekend wheaton had their first school sponsored non square dance in 143 years.  i'm a wheaton alum, and i look back on my days as a thunder (a thunder??, but then who wants to be a crusader i guess, hassling muslims and whatnot??) pretty fondly, but one thing i never really understood was how much people complained about not being allowed to dance.  seriously, it started at freshman orientation, you'd think that if people would piss and moan about anything it'd be something like not being allowed to drink or have sex, the dancing thing would fall right into line at that point.  now i'm the kind of person who'll go to a club if someone i'm with suggests it, it's definitely not the kind of thing i'd ever suggest myself, could be because me and dunx almost got arrested at a club once, but that's another entry altogether.  so anyways, it seemed like people wanted to dance if only because they weren't allowed to, like this one time i had a friend whose brother was graduating from baylor during our christmas break.  it being christmas break, the rules didn't apply, something about not being currently enrolled in school, so heading to a club wasn't forbidden.    so i was in dallas, my friend was at baylor, an hour and a half or so south, and called wanting to go out that night, something about her not having a car or being able to go anywhwere and if i didn't show up she'd be stranded and miserable.  i show up, she's there with a friend of ours and we end up going to the club, what i guess is the one club in waco, texas.  now these girls were nuts, so enthusiastic about getting to go dancing, i was pretty indifferent about the whole thing.  when we got there, we walked in, looked at the dance floor, and they looked at each other, then looked at me, then looked at each other again as if to say "what are we s'posed to  DO  here??"    it was dumb.  feeling: old thinking of: graham's in waco, if i never end up there again, it'll be too soon music: "judas' kiss" petra

      i have a pair of yellow shorts.  it's (they're??) the only piece of yellow clothing that i have, which sometimes i think is sort of odd since in high school our colors were navy and yellow, gold ostensibly, but it was always bright yellow.  but then it's not really odd, because navy is such a good dominant color and bright yellow is best served as a trim.  since i've got quite a few articles of clothing emblazoned with my school's name on it, call me nostalgic, i've got tons of navy stuff with yellow letters, trim, whatever.  so anyways, these yellow shorts i've had since twelfth grade.  they were sort of part of the school-issued football uniform.  on days we didn't practice in pads we'd all have to wear the same t-shirts and shorts, which i always found curious, i think it was a racket the coaches had going with some supplier of some sort because we all had to pay like thirty bucks for two t-shirts and a pair of shorts.  in any case, the shorts seem to have reached the end of their life span which is a shame, because they were mesh, and they were comfortable, so comfortable, in fact, that i wore them to bed.  so now i'm faced with the task of finding a replacement, because i will not,  not  sleep naked, i had a roommate who did that once and it was gross, grosser than gross, in fact.  it's a bigger deal than one might think, because dressing for sleep is way different than dressing for anything else.  i've never gotten into the whole pj thing, at least not for sleep, i got some flannel pj bottoms i'll wear around the house if it's chilly, but other than that, i'm not really a fan.  and as much as i liked the yellow shorts, i won't contribute to the racket again.  feeling: sneezy thinking of: wayne palmer and williams chicken music: "billy's bones" the pogues

      i live about fifteen hundred miles from home.  by home, i mean the place that i grew up, the place my family still lives.  i'm not certain that i'll ever be back there, at least permanently, so in the sense that i'm not sure i'll ever be there again, it's not really home.  some days, most days, in fact, i'm thankful for the distance, not that i'm glad to be away from everyone there or anything like that.  it's funny because, in being gone, sometimes i think that going back would solve whatever minute problems i perceive arise in being away from there.  people say you can never go home again, and they're right, because if you do go back, you find that it's not really home anymore.  i remember the first time i came home from school, at thanksgiving freshman year, and remember feeling like nothing had changed at all, but then subsequently realizing that three months of life had gone on, and gone on just fine without me.  here lately, i've sort of been sobered by the knowledge that nothing there will ever be the same, which i guess is ok.    i'd probly be worried if nothing changed, so i s'pose it cuts both ways.  feeling: drained thinking of: 24 music: "story of my life" social distortion

      so it's monday.  i don't see the big deal about mondays.  they can be a minor annoyance mostly because i have to leave the house earlier than normal because of the parking deal at work, but i'm pretty sure that i've mentioned that before.  it probably has to do with the fact that mondays are generally a very light day for me, the busiest days of the week are without doubt, tuesday and wednesday.  even then, despite the comparative dearth of activity on mondays, it seems as though office space, and i hate,  hate ,   hate   that movie, got it right.  remember them talking about having a "case of the mondays?"  i'm not sure i've heard anything stupider in my entire life, and i've heard jello biafra's spoken word stuff,  and  celine dion's titanic song.  maybe i'd have a "case of the mondays" monday morning if i had a case of the budweiser sunday night.  feelng: travelicious thinking of: not sure just yet music: "we're at the top of the world" the juliana theory

      i used to be a cheerleader.  maybe i've mentioned that before.  it was for two years in college, the first two.  i look back on that time of my life quite fondly, i mean it was cheerleading that afforded me the opportunity to visit such exotic locales as rock island and decatur, illinois, charged with the task and privilege of cheering the wheaton crusaders, later to become the thunder, to victory.  and on top of all that who can forget the white polyester shorts?    so anyways, i'm reminded about cheerleading because i guess they must have people there who now more adequately spur the mighty thunder to victory.  in neither of the years i spent on the cheer squad did the football team make the playoffs.  in fact one year, i actually hoped and prayed that they wouldn't, because if they had, i would have been forced to spend thanksgiving in illinois, which i was definitely not about.  it looked  pretty grim for a while because they were rolling towards an undefeated season but ended up losing to the last place team in the conference.  but like i said, they must have better cheerleaders now because yesterday they beat augustana 28-27 to secure their second consecutive conference title and as such their second consecutive playoff bid.  on top of that, the win extended their conference winning streak to seventeen games.  the most logical and obvious conclusion here is that out of all the things i've done in life, the only thing i was a total failure at was being a cheerleader.  it's not a total loss, i don't guess, i did get a nifty sweatshirt.  feeling: replaced thinking of: the mighty thunder music: "california uber alles" dead kennedys

      feels a bit more like home around here.  i grew up in dallas, about ten minutes from downtown, in a lil neighborhood called oak cliff.  maybe you're familiar with it.  we moved into a house there when i was four, my family still lives there actually.  so anyways, the neighborhood is definitely what would be considered working class, the more sheltered among those i know would likely consider it "ghetto."  it wasn't as bad as that really, not a crime ridden neighborhood by any stretch, although my dad says when we first moved there, it was way shadier.  like i said though, it wasn't a war zone or anything like that, but every once in a while something would happen that would make the papers or the news.  so anyways last night, around half past midnight, i heard some gunshots, there were five or six of them, real close to here too.  there was quite a commotion right after that, i could hear some people running around, yelling and stuff, and saw some shadowy figures moving as i peered out the kitchen window.  it was the first time in over a year of living here that i'm aware anything like that has happened.  the next morning, i heard a bit more about it, there was a fight, police cruisers went up and down the block, searching the parking lot and stuff and it made me think of those times growing up when something like that would happen close to home.  i guess it's not  totally  like home, i never did see it in the paper or on the news.  feeling: vigilant thinking of: buying a gun music: "natural born killas" ice cube and dr. dre

      i don't complain much.  i try not to anyway, don't really see the point in it.  i s'pose at this point i should qualify that complaining is different than ranting or going off on something in a fit of rage.  essential to complaining is that sort of whiny tone, you know the one, it seems to lend itself to passive agressiveness.  so to the point, last night, while i was in the middle of a pretty involved IM conversation, my internet goes out.  i know it wasn't because of a delinquent account, my bill is set up to autopay and calling comcast to see what was up was right out, mostly because they do my phone as well as my internet, and my phone and cable went out too.  it wasn't a huge deal, everything seemed to be back up and running within an hour or so and i was irritated not because it went out, that's happened before, but mostly because, like i said, i was in the middle of a conversation.  in any case, it wasn't anything on my end, which meant that someone at comcast messed up, and like i said before, it's not the first time it's happened.  so anyways, i got to thinking about what people did on a weeknight before anybody had cable, or the internet, or even the phone and i was sort of stunned because being a person who doesn't consider himself one who watches much tv, i didn't realize how much of my leisure time i spend being idly entertained.  people didn't do that way back when, they worked hard all day and came home ate dinner, hung out with the family and went to bed not too long after sunset, they had to, mostly because they had to get up before sunrise in the morning.  it's nuts to think about because you can see the progression of advances in technology and the triviality of the stuff that inconveniences people.  i remember how big of a deal it was when we got our first tv with a remote control and how cool it was to not have to get up to change the channel.  as time continues to go by, i wonder how much sillier the stuff we get irritated about will get.  at least i didn't lose the remote.  feeling: mostly adequate thinking of: coming home early today music: "memoir" audio adrenaline

      i had a smoothie for lunch yesterday.  pineapple and coconut at the lakewood mall, it was really good and last night i made a point to tell pretty much everybody i talked to about it, some people i told two or three times.  i was with marissa and sarah, which was nice, marissa and i usually go to the mall for lunch on wednesdays, i think the smoothies were her idea, and that was definitely the move, i think that made her yesterday's hero of the day.    so going to the mall sort of reminded me of christmas and shopping and stuff like that (i've been writing about stuff like that a lot here lately, we'll speculate why another time perhaps).  i'm not sure what to get anyone this year, i've done best buy gift cards the last couple years i think, so i'm pretty sure i don't want to go that route again, freakin variety, i tell you.  last year, i didn't do the bulk of my shopping til i'd gotten to dallas, so i guess i'm hoping for a stroke of creative genius to strike me by then.    i talked to laura today, and i was sort of structuring my trip home in december around her, i really wanted to be sure that i didn't miss her, so that was helpful.  i was planning to be there the weekend before, and it looks like that'll be the plan that shakes out.  she gets sunday, which i'm excited about, because by the time i see her, it'll have been a whole year.  so now i guess, you can look forward to updates on me making travel plans again like the ones i gave whenever i was trying to get my tickets to north carolina to see katie.  it could be worse, i could tell you what i had for lunch yesterday.  feeling: full of anticipation thinking of: nicole music: "el rey" vicente fernandez

      i don't have time today to do the kind of entry i want to do.  which basically means that i don't have much, if anything, of value to say today, at least not right here just this second.  i'm wondering, however, if that should stop me from writing, i mean one of the aspects of my personality that i've picked up and learned to appreciate about myself is the ability to show restraint.  meaning that if i don't have anything to say, then i won't say anything, mostly because i've noticed how irritating it is when someone who doesn't have anything to say won't shut up, it's a situation that's reached epidemic proportions.  so i'll shut up.  feeling: conflicted and increasingly surly thinking of: home music: "shut the **** up" cake

      i woke up late yesterday.  well, got up more than woke up.  i actually woke up around half past six, which is about a half hour before i usually wake up.  so like i said, it was about half past six when i woke up yesterday, but not long after that, i rolled over and went back to sleep and didn't wake up again for another 45 minutes or so.  if there's one thing in life that i  hate  it's waking up and having to get out of bed right away.  that probably comes from the part of my personality that hates being rushed.  yesterday was no exception, i got up about twenty mins after i normally wake up and it wrecked my morning, well maybe wrecked is an exaggeration, in any case, it threw the morning sufficiently off kilter.  i'm thinking though, it's nice to not be in school anymore, i got up at half past six every morning back then, that was brutal.  feeling: domestically derelict thinking of: pickup trucks music: "little things" bush

      hank hill is everyman.  i don't think i've ever come to the defense of a cartoon character.  today i feel compelled to defend hank hill, mostly because of a conversation me and bone had yesterday.  bone said that hank was a sack of crap and said that his son bobby was well-adjusted despite hank's oppressive regime of self-denial and propane fetishism.  personally, i don't necessarily think that hank's a healthy or necessarily even a good guy, my response to bone when he went off on hank was that hank is indeed everyman.  but you know how i am, ask me where i stand on something and generally my response is "anyplace you're not."  in any case, hank's not perfect, that's for sure, he's uptight, stubborn, old-fashioned, narrow-minded, rage-prone and in some ways blissfuly and maddeningly ignorant.  he's also got an insecure streak a mile wide, i think i would too, though, if cotton was my dad, but that's neither here nor there.  the fears he has of his shortcomings and inadequacies seem to lead him to force himself to conform to this very narrow and specifically defined ideal of masculinity.  those features of his personality, however, are the ones that are most easily noticed, mostly because he's a tv dad.  think of homer simpson's blatant idiocy or al bundy's savage oafishness.  everybody's got issues, hank's no different and i think that simply because the issues he deals with make him a more subjectively unpalatable character to some is no reason to say that he's a sack of crap.  however, it would be all to easy too say that hank is a good guy simply because there are people worse than him or that he's not really worse than anybody else.  no, hank hill is a man of exemplary character.  hank, despite all his shortcomings, self-perceived and otherwise, is a person characterized by loyalty, humility, authenticity, and integrity.  he showed his loyalty and humility the time that bill developed dissociative disorder and thought he was his ex-wife by putting on a dress in front of the entire strickland propane christmas party at significant risk to his own reputation and telling bill that she was never coming back.  he further shows his humility when his truck dies and he cries over it, exposing himself to ridicule from the superfically more likeable yet nearly completely morally bankrupt dale gribble.  he's authentic in that he knows who he is and won't pretend to be someone he's not, like that time that the guy from boston, i think his name was holloway, and totally wanted hank to be JR (jaay aaaaahh in his own words) from dallas, in the interest of disclosure, hank did go along with it for a bit, but wised up and told holloway that he could do business with competitor m.f. thatherton.  authenticity, however, goes only so far without integrity, which hank has in spades.  the time that the quarry was set to be drained and hank, dale, and bill figure out that boomhauer will find out that they're responsible for the loss of his beloved mustang, sally, dale and bill try and pin the blame entirely on hank.  boomhauer, aware of the quality of hank's character, sniffs them out right away and on the way home assures bobby that his father is indeed a good man.  sombody call brookhaven, i'm an addict.  feeling: slightly overwhelmed thinking of: furniture music: "teddy bear" red sovine

      i wish i was in portland today.  mostly because tonite is dunx's birthday party.  a couple weeks ago, i got the following missive from him via the email:  you are all cordially invited to my 23rd (prime) birthday party, to be held the evening of the 8th of November.  the formal parlance of this email is intended to make up for the horrid debauchery, criminal activity, and sinfulness that is to occur. i realize that you are all far away and have school/jobs, and therefore probably can't even ponder making it, but i wanted to mention it anyway. at the very least, I'll send pictures. love, dunx  i thought about going, i really did, and it would have kicked ass if i had been able to, but you know how it is, the job and stuff sort of makes it impossible.  it's been two years since i was at an honest to goodness party with dunx, three if you don't count new years which is really just s'posed to be a party anyway.  based on past experience, horrid debauchery, criminal activity, and sinfulness are all pretty accurate assessments.  in fact, i think he left out random acts of general violence, like the time we were at that party at rachel's house the day before she was s'posed to move out and those guys across the street wanted to fight us because dunx punched one of them in the face.  now  that  was a night of horrid debauchery, criminal activity, and sinfulness, that was the night of the now legendary naked party, and anybody you can party with like that is a true friend.  i've talked about dunx before, he's the friend from way back that i get to see most often, mostly because he stops here on his way between dallas and portland.  he's a badass, he really is, we grew up together, on the wrestling team and stuff, and then working like mexicans when we did maintenance at SM.  so anyways, he's 23 now, just like me, which is a bit nuts to think about since i've known him since i was about 14, and he's one of those guys i really can't say enough about, more or less just someone you know you were born to be friends with.  anybody that can nurse you through everclear chased with jack, jack and more jack and laugh at you for sleeping underneath a coffee table is definitely a true friend.  feeling: like i'm missing out thinking of: dallas music: "night on earth" bouncing souls

      dear God,  you know me, i'm a simple guy.  happy driving a ten year old japanese car with a hundred fifty thousand miles on it.  happy wearing jeans i've had since eleventh grade.  happy living in a quaint, but totally nice, lil one bedroom apartment.  there's a lot that i'm happy living without, some things i'd really like, but i'm more or less ok not having.  basically i'm not the kind of person that's really driven by material or temporal desires.  allow me, for a brief moment, to diverge, if a bit radically, from the standard condition of my personality.  so anyways, while i was out running errands yesterday i was at a red light and saw this woman, she was probably at least a couple years older than me, but in any case, she was beautiful, and driving a mercedes.  i thought to myself that at that moment, that's what's missing in my life, a really beautiful woman who drives a really expensive car.  so what i'd like right now is an unbelievably gorgeous girl who drives a really hot car, not necessarily a mercedes, maybe a bimmer, or a lexus, something like that.  i don't think that it's just a whole lot to ask for, i mean it's not like i'm asking her to pay off my student loans or anything like that, i just want her to drive me around in her car and stuff.  feeling: smart-ass thinking of: beth, she's awesome music: "bullion" millencolin

      i don't feel too good.  i don't really feel bad either, just noticeably less than tip-top.  i'm not even really sure why that is, but it's been like that for a few days.  i s'pose things could be worse, i could have raging B.O., that'd be a drag.  but i digress, and do so mightily sometimes, this seems to be one of those times.  so anyways, i got some frames today.  assorted ones, i was looking for some plain black ones, but it seems as though every retalier around here is out on basic black.  i was able to find a couple or three at big lots, they look good.  the frames are for the postcards i got off of ebay in the last couple weeks or so.  here lately i've decided that my living room's looking a bit bare, so i got some lil stuff to put around on the walls add a bit more character to the place.  linen postcards, mostly of old buildings and scenes in dallas, but one really cool one of downtown chicago.  i figure most of them are from the fifties and sixties.  alls i gotta figure out now is where to put em.  feeling: less than tip-top, weren't you paying attention? thinking of: so, so much music: "TNT" AC/DC

      screw the atm.  you know the one, you go, put your card in and get money.  well the sucky thing about that is that the money  always  comes from your  own  account, but i don't guess that that's either here or there.  my beef is that i wasn't able to withdraw money at all over the weekend, i even had issues trying to deposit my check.  it wasn't a balance issue, i was trying to get $40, which balance-wise is not, and should never be a problem, the frankin thing had run out of money.  what was  really  irritating about the whole thing is that the machine led me through all the prompts and keystrokes and crap like that, and only when i got to the very last step did it tell me that it was out of money.  it happened on sunday evening, that's when i was trying to deposit my check.  there are three machines at the bank i was at, the first one wouldn't take my deposit, the second one would take my deposit, but didn't have any cash, and the third one didn't have any cash.  i was surprised and a bit irritated, but not shocked really, i figured they probably loaded up the machine on friday afternoon and the weekend rush had done its work in decimating the supply.  so i come back the next day around one in the afternoon, thinking that it wouldn't be an issue, you know with people coming back to work on monday and everything, but once again i left empty handed.  it's one of those things that wasn't really a big inconvenience, when you think about it, it wasn't really an inconvenience at all, i didn't need cash, i could use my card for pretty much everything i'd want to buy anyway, i guess it was just frustration that the universe wasn't working the way it'd been advertised to.  i'm over it.  feeling: action packed thinking of: my room music: "caress me down" sublime

      so christmas is coming.  i don't remember most of what i got last year, i got some cologne from my grandmother, but i get that from her every year.  it's quite a deal actually because i usually end up going through a bottle every year anyway and it's the kind of thing that i'd rather not spend my own money on if i don't have to, so it all works out rather nicely.  back to the point, i don't even remember really wanting anything.  i did get to go home and that pretty much encompassed everything i wanted.  it'd been about four months since i'd been back, which is about as long as i'd ever gone between trips to dallas  this year seems to be a bit different, because lately i'm seeing all kinds of stuff that i'd like to get for christmas, definitely more than i remember wanting to get last year.  there's that jacket i was talking about sometime last week, the other stuff that's stuck out are the tony lama full-quill ostrich boots that i saw, and then some of the dvd box sets that i've seen, M*A*S*H, king of the hill, the simpsons, stuff like that.  i know i can scratch the boots off the list, those are like $300 and nobody likes me enough to spend that kind of money on me, at least not for boots, the jacket i could probably swing, but it'd likely be an either/or thing with that and the dvds.  i'm such a kid.  feeling: brown sweater thinking of: frames music: "emily" michael w. smith

      today is bone's birthday.  i feel a little bit bad because i didn't get him anything, but i don't feel real bad because i did get him the first season of 24 on dvd a couple months ago.  so anyways he's 23 today and among the friends that i have currently, one way or another, he's the one that i've known the longest.  i say one way or another because before we ever remember meeting, we allegedly met as toddlers, before long term memories were developed.  turned out that my great-grandmother was tight with his grandmother and i guess whenever they got together for pan dulce and cafe con leche they brought us along a time or two.  i  remember  meeting bone in eighth grade at the vaunted st. mark's school of texas, he was in seventh grade.  there was a bit we had in common then, we were both on the wrestling team that year and we were both from the hood.  if you know anything about SM, you know that kids from the hood have to stick together.  i don't remember being like best friends with him right away or anything like that, but over the years he was one of those guys who was always there, and not one of those guys who was always there that you wish would go away.  most of what i remember from high school about him was wrestling weekends, unbelivably long saturdays spent in gyms laughing at guys in jumpsuits, the roadtrips, seeing teammates and parents drunk in hotels around the southwest, and then just hanging around campus talking about how he hoodwinked ruff into getting him illicit reading material.  so anyways, you know how it is when graduation comes around, i finished, he had a year left, i went to chicago and a year later he went down to austin, and even since then we've somehow managed to cram as much into the limited times we've been able to hang out as we seemed to when we were at school and saw each other every day.  mostly trips to cici's, some movies, christmas shopping at the rich folk malls, fajitas, calling for the head of erstwhile longhorn quarterback chris simms, accusing each other of being various and sundry unsavory characters we both know, and troglodyte ogling in grapevine and assorted other places.  you're a good man bone, a good man and a true friend.  feeling: good thinking of: banging ____________________  i'll let bone fill in the blank, it's his day music: "green, green grass of home" merle haggard

      so yesterday i worked.  that's not par for the course, usually i get thursdays and saturdays every week, and i didn't really plan to work yesterday, but sometime in september i got a phone call asking if i would be a member of some commitee whose meeting was yesterday.  i sort of feel like a sucker, not really because i said yes, because i don't mind doing it at all, but when i was recruited for this whole thing, they told me the meeting started at ten, but neglected to tell me that the whole thing would last til sometime near four.  if i'd known that i'd be there that long, i likely wouldn't have gone in on friday.  it's all good though, i got to drive to pasadena, which is a place i'd never been before and i met some neat people which is always cool.  i try to avoid driving on the freeways around here, which is generally the way to go because the traffic is, nearly without exception, atrocious, but yesterday wasn't so bad.  in the fourteen months or so that i've been here, i can count the number of times i've driven on the freeways on both hands, it's nice.  the route wasn't especially scenic, i mean unless you like the view of railyards from overpasses, then you'd probably think it's rather picturesque, just not my cup of tea though.  on an unrelated note, i need a beanie.  feeling: hoodwinked thinking of: what i want for christmas music: "career opportunities" the clash

      i had a cup of coffee today.  i've definitely not acquired a taste for it and that being the case, having had some yesterday is most definitely unlike me.  it'd very likely take only the fingers on one hand to count the number of cups of coffee i've had in my life to this point.  i did have to load it up with cream and sugar, so much so that a purist might suggest that what i drank wasn't actually coffee at all.  i probably wouldn't have had it were it not for the fact that it was the only beverage i saw at the meeting i had this morning.  you know how it is, beggars can't be choosers.  but then i really don't think it was much a coincidence or if it was, it was a symbolic and timely one.  today is annie's birthday and she's a total coffee fiend.  i got to talk to her in the morning before i left, wish her a happy birthday stuff like that, she told me it made her day, which made my day.  back in march whenever i was last in chicago, we got to spend a whole day together, which was mostly unplanned but only like the best day ever, the road trip from hinsdale to lisle and lunch on the patio at houlihan's, it was great.  it was one of those days that seems forever ago, but you remember it like it was yesterday.  i still kinda wish it was just yesterday.  feeling: responsible thinking of: horns-huskers today music: "radio havana" rancid

      i saw laura today.  we go way back, almost five years, and i know i've told the story of when/how we met  and how exactly we got to be friends,   urlLink here   it is for any and all of you who would need/like a refresher on that one.  not counting the camp we met at and seeing each other there again a year later, we've seen each other six times, which i guess is odd for someone who is as good a friend to me as she is, especially considering that we've known each other as long as we have.    i've written before, or at least alluded to, about how stringently i define the word "friend," that it's not a word that i at all tend to throw around haphazardly, and that for me to really and truly call someone a friend an mean it in a way that's more than a mere figure of speech that there has to be a pretty significant relationship there.  laura and i have that, and even though it wasn't like i'd forgotten about it or how great she is or anything like that, getting to spend time with her today was like finding a hundred dollar bill in the pocket of some jeans bound for the laundry.  today, i went to church with her and we went to lunch afterward, we'd been planning this day for months, like since august, and we ended up spending about four good hours together.  to be really honest, i was a bit nervous about the whole thing, you know how it is when you build up expectations of something for so long (part of the reason i don't do countdowns, they inevitably lead to letdowns) and on top of that we'd never spent that much time with each other.  laura's the youngest out of all the people i consider friends, and neither of us has been great about writing letters since i moved out here.  i wondered if there was really much more there than just the novelty of writing letters to someone so far away.  in the end, those fears were, in some ways for nothing, because they didn't get realized, but in that they didn't get realized, they were good for something because they helped me appreciate what a friendship i have with her, to understand the love that's there.  that day was even better than i'd imagined it to be, and make no mistake, despite my slight trepidaciousness, i'd imagined that it would be awesome.  thanks laura, you're the best.  feeling: understood thinking of: today music: "living in your letters" dashboard confessional

      home, sweet franking home.  it's so so good to be back.  weird, it always is, but i'm used to the weirdness in such a way that it's not so weird anymore.  my dad met me at the airport thursday afternoon around one and we went to my grandparents' house right after that.  there was christmas fallout, i guess afterglow would be a better word, since christmas over there is done christmas eve, presents opened at the stroke of midnight.  they were making tamales, tradition of traditions that is, and i spent pretty much all day there.  too worn out to really do much else, i was up til like four on monday nite, til about three wednesday nite, and around five last nite.  i made it to brad's to see him and dunx, didn't really do much, but then we never really have to.  saw my abuela today (my dad's mom) and that was really cool, i'd missed her last year, whenever i went by, she wasn't there, and i'll see bone tonite.  tomorrow i see laura and i'm so so excited about that, we're having lunch, it'll be great.  feeling: nostalgic thinking of: time and its thickness music: "buenas noches from nacogdoches" kid bros. of st. frank

      i fell asleep before eleven last nite.  but it was on the couch, so it didn't count.  i guess i fell asleep so early because i was up til like four the night (morning?) before.  it was funny because i was unbelievably alert and productive during the day yesterday, especially in the morning.  i went to target before going to work and got my mom's gift.  i definitely learned my lesson on monday as to when to shop, the whole before/after work conflict.  either that or i fell asleep so early because office space was on.  good gravy is that movie awful.  feeling: relieved and incomplete thinking of: bus, taxi, or drive music: "feliz navidad" jose feliciano

      i love shopping.  you have no idea, right now shopping during the week leading up to christmas in california is my favorite thing of all time, right up there with people who don't use blinkers at stop signs or when they cut you off.  so yesterday i went christmas shopping.  i know i wasn't any more derelict about it this year than i have been in years past, but it seems as though i was based on my experience last night.  i guess the big factor is that i won't be home at all before christmas, usually i was able to have the weekend before christmas to do my shopping and it got done without incidient.  having spent twenty years in dallas, i knew what places to avoid when in order to evade the throngs of wall to wall people that seem to infest local retailers about this very time every year.  having lived in southern california just over a year, i don't have that familiarity, and even if i did, traffic would be plenty mitigating to an effort to make it to a place like that if it was far enough out, which was never the case in dallas, because traffic could never  dream  of being as horrific as it is out here, and even if it was, i knew all the shortcuts there anyway.  i go back for more today.  feeling: puffy eyes thinking of: why that kid couldn't fall asleep music: "cristalena" MxPx

      deepest apologies.  i's back, i wasn't really gone, i don't s'pose.  just more or less away from the blog since about thursday, so i kinda feel like i should apologize to anyone who missed me, which judging from the readership is more than a handful, but less than legion, is there an adequate adjective to describe a group of such number, someone pass that along, i'm usually on top of vocab stuff like that.    in any case, i did drive to san diego and back twice over the weekend tho, so i guess that qualifies as being away.  wes was here, in san diego anyways, his grandparents live there, and every other year the whole family shows up there for christmas for like almost two weeks, so he had a day to get away for a bit, so i switched friday for thursday as my day off this week so i had friday and saturday to hang out with him.    me and wes used to be roommates and out of all the roommates i ever had, i get along with him the best.  probly because we have such similar senses of humor.  it was a blast, i hadn't seen him since last march whenever i went to chicago.  so we saw bad santa and lent crappy vocals to AC/DC and metallica among others.  i won't have that kind of fun again for a week, at least.  feeling: behind thinking of: a kettle and where to get a stars jersey in california music: "the eight polish foods of christmas" veggie tales

      i used to have some roommates.  this was before i moved out here, back when i lived in wheaton.  i moved from there in may of 2002, so it's been a lil over a year and a half since i've had any roommates.  the last living arrangement i had there was a two bedroom apartment which i shared with three other guys, it was on michigan street, just on the other side of the railroad tracks from campus.  you learn a lot about yourself from having roommates, even if it's several months after you stop living with them, like yesterday for example.  i got an email from wes, the last guy i actually shared a room with.  he said that the commercials for the movie "bad santa" reminded him immediately of me.  i seem to get stuff like that a lot.  like last year whenever i went back to wheaton for a visit, wes' roommates told me that his sense of humor was much more lascivious than it normally was.  they went on to say that he wasn't like that when i wasn't around.  age 23, and i'm already a dirty old man.  feeling: misunderstood :) thinking of: dereliction in christmas shopping music: "your cheatin heart" hank williams

      so they got him.  looking at the pictures, it seemed as though the one they got was karl marx, either him or the guy that hangs out by the liquor store at the corner.  but no, from what i heard it was saddam hussein.  the capture made pretty big news, evidently it happened overnight on saturday because i first saw the story a few minutes after waking up on sunday morning.  well, good for them, us, whoever.  the sooner the war's over the better.  i wasn't really in favor of the whole thing, but since they went, i'm glad they've stuck around to make sure that they didn't leave the iraqis twisting in the wind like they did after the first war.  saddam wasn't deposed and once the u.s. miltary took off, he went back to brutalizing the people who opposed him.  i guess the whole thing's a pretty touchy subject and very politically loaded, precisely the kind of stuff i don't really like to blog about, but i've been pondering some of the stuff i've read/heard here lately.  i was reading this morning where there was a catholic cardinal who was upset over the way saddam was treated, saying that he was treated "like a cow."  i'm not sure that i agree with that particular sentiment, i don't imagine that he was treated appreciably differently than other captured enemies are treated, the media coverage was more intense simply because of who he is.    however, it seems to me that the cardinal's words were borne out of true concern for another human being, as opposed to simply being contrarian or advancing an agenda.  case in point is part of the quote that didn't make it into the headline: "seeing him like this, a man in his tragedy, despite all the heavy blame he bears, I had a sense of compassion for him."  make no mistake, saddam deserves everything he's gonna get, and very likely much worse.  i just guess that hearing someone who has obviously considered his opinion in light of the convictions he holds and sees the complexity present is a breath of fresh air.  come to think of it, i haven't seen that liquor store guy since over the weekend.  feeling: slightly out of place thinking of: snow music: "my evil plan to save the world" five iron frenzy

      i haven't figured out how to turn on the heater.  that's in my apartment, the one in the car is pretty easy.  the one in the apartment, on the other hand looks like an artifact from the early part of the previous century.  there's a lil knob at the bottom of it, which i've located and figured out how to turn, but to no avail.  mostly because i suspect the pilot light hasn't been lit.  what's a bit frustrating is that i don't really know where the pilot light is in this silly thing, in the lil directions on the thing, it tells me in step #2 simply to light the pilot light, without so much as mentioning where the franking thing can be found.  so saturday morning, i armed myself with the lighter, you know the one with the long neck you use to light the stove, and tried to find the gas, which pretty much went nowhere.  better judgement led me to stop that particular operation after a few minutes, i didn't want to blow the place to high holy hell.  i'm pretty sure i'd have forfeited my deposit if i'd done that.  feeling: defective Y chromosome thinking of: long sleeves music: "hands down" dashboard confessional

       second of two   so i've got these presuppositions.  and in order to more adequately understand the internal (both cognitive and affective) context of some of the stuff i write, i guess a bit of a primer is in order.  the most significant presupps that i got tend to be spiritual in nature, mostly nature of God sort of things, even what i believe about myself is informed by those more than they are anything else.  bascially, the one of consequence here is that i owe the entirety of my existance to God and that he's faithful even when i'm not.  more than that, he seems to be most faithful when i'm least faithful, reminding me that he's so much bigger than me and so much better at orchestrating my life than i am.  in any case, this week's been good.  and it's been good not because anything spectacularly good has happened, but more because there have been lil unexpected things that have just sort of made the regular stuff better.  what sticks out are sunday and tuesday.  sunday i went to that christmas concert with sarah, and i don't think that could have possibly been a better night than it was.  she had to go to work like right after that, which i thought was kind of a drag at first, but looking back, i feel like it's better that it worked out that way.  tuesday i went to a luncheon up in west covina and carpooled with this guy john.  i know him pretty casually and since we were both driving up from long beach, we decided to carpool.  he's a cool guy, quite a bit older than me, i think he's 40 actually, and here lately i've been sort of hyper-aware that i've been lacking a mentor-type figure.  so anyways, it was really good getting to talk to him, the sort of conversation that i've really been craving lately.  it was pretty unexpected and pretty much precisely what i've needed for a little while here.  it's funny because here lately i haven't really felt like i've been all that faithful, and mostly i've been reminded that good things happen in my life more often in spite of myself than they do because of me or anything it is that i do.  feeling: undeserving thinking of: stamps music: "dust to dust" keith green

       first of two   i'm not the most detail oriented person.  i know i've mentioned that before, and i ususally pay for that in occasional slight aggravation.  since i seem to generally not pay much attention to details, i only seem to notice when little things go wrong, you know how it is, when you drop something and it lodges itself so perfectly in a place so as to make it inaccesible.    [sidebar]it's like that time i was in college and i was headed up to my room, i'm getting out my keys to get on the elevator (we had this lil lazer tag thing that summoned the elevator) and i drop them, in stride, my foot hits them and i kick them into the lil crevice where the floor ends and the elevator door starts.  i knew exactly where they were, but couldn't get them til the next day.[/sidebar]  so anyway, being the way that i am, when the details, the little things, go well, i don't tend to notice and i'm definitely not mindful enough to appreciate them.  they get taken for granted.  but this week's been a bit different in that respect, nothing huge, but i've noticed that a couple or three things have worked out really well, in fact, i feel like they worked out better than they would have if i'd planned out the details myself.  i'm still not sure how that works.  feeling: taken care of, in spite of myself thinking of: stochasticism and determinism music: "bastards on parade" dropkick murphys

      Livin on the road my friend, is gonna keep you free and clean. Now you wear your skin like iron. Your breath as hard as kerosene.  You weren't your momma's only boy, but her favorite one it seems. She began to cry when you said goodbye And sank into your dreams.  Pancho was a bandit boy, his horse was fast as polished steel. He wore his gun outside his pants For all the honest world to feel.  Pancho met his match you know on the deserts down in Mexico. Nobody heard his dyin words, but that's the way it goes.  All the Federales say, they could've had him any day, They only let him slip away, out of kindness I suppose.  Lefty he can't sing the blues all night long like he used to. The dust that Pancho bit down south ended up in Lefty's mouth. The day they laid poor Pancho low, Lefty split for Ohio Where he got the bread to go, there ain't nobody knows.  All the Federales say, they could've had him any day They only let him slip away out of kindness I suppose.  The boys tell how old Pancho fell, and Lefty's livin in cheap hotels. The desert's quiet, Cleveland's cold And so the story ends we're told;  Pancho needs your prayers it's true, but save a few for Lefty too He only did what he had to do, and now he's growing old.  All the Federales say, they could've had him any day They only let him go so long, out of kindness I suppose.  A few gray Federales say, they could've had him any day They only let him go so long, out of kindness I suppose.  --"Pancho and Lefty" Willie Nelson & Merle Haggard

      i don't like being outdoors smithers. for one thing, there's too many fat children.  there are three sides to every story.  that's what i've heard anyway; your side, my side, and the truth.  so monday night, during a commercial on monday night raw, i surfed the channels; i mean   urlLink world's fattest blackest mark henry   was on, you would have changed it too, or resorted to self-immolation had you been unable to find the remote.   luckily for me the remote was easily located and so i stopped on ABC, which was showing this investigative deal on what i guess was the state of nutrition on america.  basically it was peter jennings railing on the food industry for making america the fattest population on the planet, and in the subsequent interviews, food industry figures making the case that they were simply giving the public what they said they wanted in the way of more food, which is basically to say larger portions, increased convenience and the like.  further copping out, they gave the somewhat oversimplistic explanation that if americans wanted to avoid becoming overweight and obese, the answer was to excercise more.  the truth, as always, lay somewhere in between both accounts, or perhaps beyond them, if you're a philosophical type who doesn't dig continuums (continua??) .  i got the impression while watching the thing that the media were (was??) trying to make the food industry its next scapegoat, like what they did with tobacco.  bascially what it boiled down to was peter jennings suggesting to the food industry execs he was interviewing that  they  are responsible for people's individual choices to overeat, simply by providing the means to do it as well as the kind of enticement that no average person would be able to overcome.  kinda like the way the tobacco industry was deemed responsible for people who chose to smoke.  the flip side of that was that the food industry folks were in full denial of any responsibility at all.  true enough that exercise and increased activity helps people from turning into total fatasses, simply encouraging people to eat their fill, or perhaps more, and proposing excercise as a catch-all is pretty irresponsible.  what really seemed to rub me the wrong way was their approach to adbertizing, especially as it concerned kids.  they were accusing parents of not shouldering enough responsibility for their kids' nutrition.  which made tons of sense, i mean since they never market directly to kids, you know, through using cartoon characters or making their packaging appealing to them.  it was pretty instructive, but probably not in a way that any of the parties involved expected or hoped for it to be.  what i got from it is that, basically everyone wants to hold someone else responsible for their excesses.  feeling: invigorated thinking of: good timing music: "american badass" kid rock

      i'm searching for calendars.  wall calendars to be quite specific and to date, nothing has really piqued my interest so much that i've felt that i  had  to get it.  i'll confess to not having looked very earnestly, mostly when i've been out on other errands or something like that.  i think it started when i was at borders a week and a half or so ago and realized that it was nearly december and that i haven't had a calendar since i got the 2001 britney spears calendar, mostly as a joke, although the febuary and october pictures were quite lovely.  i think before that the last one i had was 1999, that one had curious george on it.  so what i've been looking for is stuff that is or will be of some sentimental value to me, something that would serve as a bit of a connection to my past, stuff in my past that i value anyway.  since that's been the goal, what i've been looking for has been stuff of texas and chicago, though i did take a bit of a longer look at the johnny cash calendar, he's just such a badass, i saw, as well as the lizzie mcguire one, she's just so adorable, but like when i was looking for that hoodie a couple months ago, finding what i want has been no mean feat.  it seems as though for the purposes of watching days pass by, the only places that exist around here are paris, england, ireland, and of course california.  i bet if there was a curious george/britney calendar, it'd be geared to a "specialty" audience.  feeling: prepared thinking of: her music: "a little less conversation" elvis presley

      winter has come to southern california.  well, it rained anyway, and i was nearly devastated when i realized that it was the closest to snow that we'd get out here.  didn't really have the time to think about that last year.  the sun's been setting at half past four though, so at least  something  felt right.  so anyways, yesterday was sunday and it was a good day.  i think that out of all the months on the calendar, december has the most distinctive feel.  more than anything, that statement makes me feel like i'm stating the obvious, but when that feeling sort of dawns on you, it's just so pleasant and warm.  like last night, i went to a christmas concert, which was totally beautiful, the music was wonderful, choir, soloists, backed by an orchestra, organ, piano, stuff like that.  i was with sarah, and before it she was talking about what a hectic day it'd been and saying that she was pretty stressed.  i was feeling a bit similar, though probably not to the same degree and as i was taking her home she was talking about how warm and peaceful she felt, as opposed to what she was feeling before, that resonated with me because when i thought about it, she was definitely right.  so i guess based on all that, it  feels  like december.  there are definitely worse things to feel, a broken glass-thumbtacks-barbed wire board match, for example.  feeling: warm thinking of: last nite music: "if it all comes true" chagall guevara

      what a cruddy weekend.  at least football-wise, the rest wasn't so bad, but i think i'll talk about that tomorrow.  so anyways, the scores were as follows:  mount union 56, wheaton 10 philadelphia 36, dallas 10 kansas st. 35, oklahoma 7  neither of the first two were surprising.  wheaton's had an awesome season, its best ever, but not even my fabulous cheering techniques would seem to have helped.  mount union had won 53 straight and six out of the last seven national titles, and had knocked wheaton out of the playoffs last year.  no one's come close to touching them in about four years.  beating them would have been a  major  upset.  so anyways, the purple raiders move on, likely to win their seventh national title in eight years and wheaton goes back to campus, ostensibly to dance, now that they can.  the cowboys lost, to filthydelphia, but the eagles been tearing it up lately.  in fact, the last game they lost was to the cowboys, and that was like eight weeks or so ago.  i'm a bit worried about the cowboys, i've resigned myself to the fact that they're likely one and done in the playoffs, but i'd like to see them win 10 this year, which, from the way they've played the last couple weeks, i'm not sure they'll end up doing.  the shocker here was the ou and k-state, which effectively messed up the horns' best plans, which were either fiesta or rose bowl.  i mean it's not oklahoma's fault for not beating k-state, the horns could have saved themselves some trouble by not getting the ever living shite kicked out of them by the sooners, but it seems sorry that a team with more losses than them which they beat gets a better bowl than the the horns do.  all that said, f**king sooners.  feeling: satisfied thinking of: disneyland, it's not what you think music: "stupid kid" caedmon's call

      i went to the mall today.  gearing up for christmas shopping more or less.  i didn't get much, just some cards, which i'm going back to sending this year.  i didn't send any out last year which i think was kinda sorry on my part, but then there was a lot going on, having just moved here and all.  i was actually quite relieved simply to have made it home for the holiday.  the cards i got were pretty sweet, they're both adorable looking.  one's got a snowman on it and the other's got a lil angel.  this year i didn't have any problem finding ones that actually said "christmas," something that had been an issue in years past.  i mean i understand that there are several late-december holidays that represent all kinds of PC crap, but that doesn't retract from the reality that christmas indeed exists, it caused me something of an ontological crisis last year.  if we've never met and you'd like a card, i'd be happy to oblige, just    urlLink email    your address.  feeling: sinus headache thinking of: sudafed music: "red hot moon" rancid

      i dig christmas music.  this is a good time of year to do that, being december and all.  generally, it's the only time i do think about christmas music, which makes sense.  that wasn't always the case, however.  when i was real little, we hung out with my grandma a lot, go on errands with her and stuff.  around that time she drove a white chevy monte carlo, probly an early 80's model, which had a cassette player in it, a feature that was in neither of my parents' cars.  you know how it is when you're a little kid, you'd get a movie on video and drive your parents to consider abandoning you because of your watching it at least eight or nine times a day and i'm pretty sure that we drove my grandmother to similar madness.  see she had this tape of a  very  young wayne newton singing christmas carols.  she started playing it one winter and we dug it.  every time we'd get in her car we'd clamor to hear it.  christmas came and went and still we'd want to hear nothing else, so wayne newton belted out christmas favorites all the way through at least march.  no more wayne newton anymore, and i'll never figure out what led some grade school kids into a fascination with his christmas album.  no, the current source for christmas music is wheaton college's WETN radio.  they started with christmas music the day after thanksgiving and are playing it non-stop through new year's day.    urlLink here's   the link if you're down with christmas music and can listen in your office or something like that, definitely some cheerful background noise, though they do break for chapel monday, wednesday and friday, and for the occasional thunder athletic contest.  seriously, wayne newton?  what was that about?  feeling: well-groomed thinking of: christmas cards music: "coffee mug" the descendants

      things are back to normal.  back to status quo anyways.  normal is a state of being which i'm not sure exists, but that's likely fodder for another day's entry.  i took my dad to the airport this morning for his flight back to dallas after spending a week here, not that things were terribly, terribly different when he and my sister were here, but like i was saying yesterday, it brought about some difference, which i appreciated and was glad to have.  besides that, today was more or less a pedestrian sort of day.     more or less  a pedestrian day, because tonight was the night the FOX network decided to unleash upon the world television genius the likes of which has  never  heretofore been seen in the form of a fabulous show called "the simple life".  make no mistake about it, this show is unadulterated greatness.  i'm a pretty versatile, adaptable sort of guy.  i grew up in texas, where i went to a prep school with the offspring of dallas' society types, some of my best friends were the princess types who differ from paris hilton not at all in type and only in degree, and even then not by just a whole, whole lot.  so i feel like i can relate, be it ever so slightly, to the sort of epicurean life that these young ladies are accustomed to.  like i said though, i grew up in texas, which also afforded me plenty of opportunities to spend time in the sticks, and for good old fashioned hand-dirtying manual labor.    paris and nicole probly think manual labor is the president of mexico.  feeling: amused thinking of: the simple life, my new all time favorite show.  ever. music: "walk on water" audio adrenaline

      so i haven't written in a few days.  apologies to the half-dozen or so of you whose dearth of better things to do or perhaps whose lapses in better judgement lead you to visit this corner of the web.  kidding of course, i kid, i kid because i love.  anyways, my dad's here, my sister came with him, but she had to leave friday morning, they came out for thanksgiving, been staying at my place since tuesday.  it was sweet to have them out here, neither of them had ever been to california before, and it'd been a long time since i'd seen either of them, i last saw my dad in march and my sister in december.    that having been said, it's different having people in my apartment, houseguests, as it were, i guess.  i've gotten so used to solitude, at least as far as living quarters go, that someone else's constant presence in my place over a period of a few days felt slightly foreign.  i'm not territorial or anything like that, anybody that knows me halfway decently knows that, but the comfort level is maybe not lowered, but different.    take writing, for example.  right now, i'm blogging at work, which, typically, isn't something that i do, personal boundaries and whatnot.  i usually blog in the mornings before i head off to work, but then i haven't really had work since last wednesday, which, incidentally has me feeling quite quite useless, but sort of throws a wrench in the rhythm of the day.  i'm not complaining or anything like that, i always appreciate days off and a trek off the beaten path, but it forces some degree of regrouping as far as staying on top of things goes.  back to the point, writing is something i've come to associate with solitude, and not having had that at home here lately i'm thinking that's at least partly why i haven't written the past few days.  i get the feeling that it'd feel like playing air hockey on a pool table.  i  think  i'm on top of things anyway.  feeling: ambivalent thinking of: haze music: "music box superhero" the juliana theory

      i don't s'pose i'm really what anybody would call "politically involved"  there was a gubernatorial election here a while back and the only thing that could really pique my interest with all that was taco bell's pseudo election that the democrats got all pissed about.  (read about it  urlLink here )  i didn't vote in either election, and i'm pretty sure i feel worse about missing out on the taco bell election than i do about skipping the "real" election, i mean at that point i'd barely lived in california a year, i'd known taco bell my whole life.  in any case, there's another election coming up later this year and given my pretty solid distaste for national politics, or more specifically, the players in national politics, i'm not really thinking very seriously about voting, and as such who i'd vote for.  i'd think about it if i could vote "none of the above," but i guess that's neither her nor there.  anyways, yesterday i stumbled upon  urlLink this site , which is sort of a lil deal that asks you some questions about your opinion on different policy issues and uses an algorithm to tell you which candidate best fits your ideology.    it was illuminating, not necesarily educating, but it was helpful.  my list was as follows:  1. Libertarian Candidate (61%) 2. Sharpton, Reverend Al - D (58%)  3. Green Party Candidate (58%)  4. Kucinich, Rep. Dennis, OH - D (57%)  5. Socialist Candidate (50%)  6. LaRouche, Lyndon H. Jr. - D (48%) 7. Dean, Gov. Howard, VT - D (44%)  7. Bush, President George W. - R (44%)  9. Kerry, Senator John, MA - D (42%)  10. Edwards, Senator John, NC - D (39%)  11. Clark, Retired General Wesley K., AR - D (35%) 12. Lieberman, Senator Joe, CT - D (29%) 13. Moseley-Braun, Former Senator Carol, IL - D (24%)  14. Gephardt, Rep. Dick, MO - D (21%) 15. Phillips, Howard - Constitution (20%) 16. Hagelin, Dr. John - Natural Law (11%)  odd, that libertarian and green both showed up so high on the list, but in 2000 i considered myself about equally likely to vote harry browne (libertarian nominee) and jello biafra (finished second in the greens' nomination) so i'm not really shocked by it.  i'm not sure what that means beyond a pretty decided ideological ambivalence to vote either republican or democrat, which i guess is why the three strongest candidates from those parties are bunched up in the middle, dean and bush at 44% and kerry at 42%.    al sharpton was the highest name on my list, which surprised me, surprised, but didn't shock, i mean we  are  in the same line of work.  i think it sucks that he's a democrat, the democrats aren't going to do anything for him at all, and to be honest it's pretty disgusting the way they use his constituency, whenever he fails to get the nomination, they'll expect him to deliver them the black vote simply because black people vote democrat.    in any case, sharpton and kucinich are the only candidates who are saying anything at all that resonates with me, so here's my deal, if sharpton's candidacy is still breathing by the time the califorina primary rolls around, i'll vote for him.  if he wins the party nomination, i'll vote for him.  if not, i'll either vote libertarian or not vote at all, i don't think i could bring myself to vote for the greens.  vote sharpton.  feeling: productive thinking of: what i don't have music: "six foot five" lars fredriksen and the bastards

      a friend of mine went to the doctor one time, and you know it bugs me, all this health stuff; like people who are worried about being in good health. . .like you're gonna live forever.    life, sooner or later, life will kill us all.    so i figure you may as well live a little and get your money's worth for dying.  like people worried about diet, i'm going, if you cut out all the cholesterol, and all the calories and all the fat outta my diet, what would be the point of eating??  i, uh, i'm not a big health nut.  and, uh, i'm kinda glad i'm not.  cause i, uh, this friend of mine, he's so careful about what he, everything, he went to the doctor and he was having these terrible headaches, and the doctor examined him, couldn't find anything wrong with him.  so he asked him,   "well, uh, do you smoke?"   and the guy said "oh, no i never smoke." "are you ever around second hand tobacco?" "no, i never go anywhere where i might encounter second-hand tobacco, i'm very careful about that." and the doctor said "wow, do you, are you a drinking man?" "no, i am a teetotaler, i've been a teetotaler since i was sixteen." the doctor said "well, do you watch a lot of television?" "no, i never watch television, the only thing i do for entertainment is, i read my bible." the doctor said "then ok, i prescribe for you a pack of cigarettes and a six pack of beer, and a real good movie.  if i was as uptight as you, my head'd hurt too."  --rich mullins

      so yesterday was kind of a long day.  it started early, they always start early.  i don't have to be at work til nine, but i'm usually awake and out of bed between half past six and seven.  there's not much more that i hate than the feeling that comes when i wake up and look at the clock and realize that i  have  to get up right away and be somewhere, so i avoid it by getting up earlier than i necessarily have to.  i don't like being rushed.  but then for that reason, i sorta feel like i  do  have to get up at that time, that it's the kind of thing that's essential to my mental health.  even with that being the case and me using that time the way that i do, i feel like i could and really should be using that time more effectively.  there's been a lot to do lately, mostly at work, and like i said yesterday was long.  i've started biting my nails again, i'm not even sure what that means, but i'm pretty sure it's not symbolic of anything great.  anyways, the last couple of days were the kind of days where interacting with people made me ridiculously aware of how differently i perceive things than they do.  it's nothing bad, i think i'm just being stretched.  the hardest part about everything lately has been maintaining patience, and if i'm saying it's difficult to be patient, then there's little doubt that the whole deal is pretty nuts.    it's nothing bad, like i said, i'm being stretched and i'm pretty sure that it's something that i'll be better off for because it's making me consider how i do a lot of the stuff that i do, specifically work stuff, and why i'm doing it and if i should change anything and it's the kind of thing that will definitely spur me to be more thoroughly aware of what i'm doing and stuff.  so there you have it i guess.  feeling: barely adequate, which i'm not sure is any better than hopelessly inadequate thinking of: haircut music: "la donna e mobile" from  rigoletto  by verdi, i think

      so i watched boston public this week.  i notice that i've been talking a lot about tv lately, two entries in the last three days anyway, not sure if that's "a lot", i guess i'll let the public decide.  so boston public, it's a weird show in terms of quality, it sort of reminds me of M*A*S*H in that, at its best, it can be brilliant, but when it hits a low, it becomes a melodramatic, nearly painful to watch caricature of itself.  the lows are worse than that actually, they lead to the kind of experience that makes you long for a pot of scalding hot water for you to immerse your head into so as to avoid the experience of having to sit through the train wreck that's happening right in front of you, or at the very least make you wish that you lived in frontier times when you could do something better like shovel manure.  this last episode was one that would fall into the latter category.  the big conflict was over a bake sale that was put on to prove a point regarding affirmative action, mostly that it unfairly gave persons of color advantages at the expense of qualified white people.  there was a stink about people doing stuff like this on college campuses sometime last year.  the way it would go was that some campus conservative group, somebody like college republicans would set up an innocuous enough looking bake sale table and peddle their pastries to the public.  the much more nefarious (some would say) aim of the project came to light whenever the pricelist was displayed and showed different prices based on the customer's ethnicity.  white customers would have to pay the most, and persons of other ethnicities paid less for the same items based on their ethnicity.  affirmative action is one of those issues that's rather polarizing.  it shouldn't be, it's far too complex to be, for better or for worse, however, that's the case.  it's also an issue that a lot of people presume to have an opinion on without really having a clue about its complexity or its scope, that's probly why it's so polarizing.  the vast majority of people formulate their opinions based on the symbols they interact with in the mass media.  that's not really helpful, mostly because those just serve to make people stupider.    so anyways, the next morning, i was talking to bone and he asked me if i was against affirmative action, to which i replied "i don't think anybody is."  there's not a lot that would make me happier than shooting holes in the arguments of privileged type-A white kids who think they're oppressed because they feel like the system has gone too far.  the same kids very likely would never think about raising a similar objection to the use of legacy or athletic talent as a factor in any sort of admissions process, well, the nerds might bitch about athletic scholarships, and they're probably right to, but that's an entire other entry for another day.  back to the point, legacy and athletic scholarships, are the longest running forms of affirmative action, but since they favor people with advantage, people whose advantage benefits the system in such a way that it's a known quantity specifically, nobody seems to complain about them.    it cuts both ways though; and that being the case, it's equally misguided to think that taking ethnicity into account somehow makes things "fair" because of the held belief that all white people have somehow had an advantage simply because of phenotype.  that is to say that simply being white doesn't preclude a person from being a member of the underclass.   urlLink jim goad   urlLink makes this point  better than i ever could.  basically his point is that the underclass has been exploited by the privileged class without any regard whatsoever to skin color, that race has been used as a smokescreen to cover up substantially more significant conflict between classes, and that there are  huge  double standards at work, specifically in the descriptions of members of the underclass, double standards that are fed by members of the privileged class to fortify their smokescreen.  basically if you're one of the dipshits who agreed with toni morrison when she said that bill clinton was america's first black president, you're acknowledging that jim goad is right and that you've been hoodwinked by the mass media.  so nobody's against affirmative action.  that's not to say that people aren't against affirmative action when they perceive that it favors others at their own expense, but there's tons more to affirmative action than looking for people that aren't white to fill spots in workplaces and educational institutions.  in any case, being either completely  in favor of it or completely against it presupposes that apart from ethnicity, or legacy, or athletic ability, or whatever variable is thrown in, objective standards are being used in the first place to determine who is or who isn't deserving of a spot.  fairness is a shitty goal to have anyway.   feeling: gimpy kneed thinking of: kleenex music: "the lines of my earth" sixpence

      i watch "walker, texas ranger."  i know it's not quality tv, but i'm helpless.  i seem to have a weakness for crappy, overly dramatic tv, case in point, that time i was addicted to melrose place in tenth grade.  besides the fact that i can't/couldn't manage to tear myself away from either of them, walker and melrose place were/are nothing at all alike.  at least i had an exuse for the melrose place deal, i was fifteen.  i think i like walker so much because it appeals not only to my desire to be passively entertained, but it fits into what i feel like the medium of tv should be, which is simply to entertain people.  tv tends to render itself useless, or worse yet, earn itself a false pretense of usefulness whenever it tries to pass itself off as a medium that can accomplish any sort of elevated discourse on significant issues.  there are, of course, exceptions to that rule, but by and large, people forumlating most of their opinions on subjects that are even slightly deeper than trivial based on what they see on tv seems more harmful than helpful.    i don't feel so bad about watching walker.  feeling: restrained, or maybe constrained thinking of: the hierarchy of needs music:   urlLink "standard" paradigm

      never read much, but she loved to quote love is a dead language all she offered in her parting note  love is a dead language  i close my eyes and it's all i hear it rings as hollow as a high school cheer who did you plagiarize this time, dear? love is a dead language  outside is a twilight snow love is a dead language  sounds romantic, but i doubt you'd know love is a dead language  one soft bullet and the rest is blurred i claw the sky like a flying bird you've done your duty you've spread the word love is a dead language  never felt anything she couldn't touch love is a dead language never came close, 'cause she knew too much love is a dead language so here's to us all who were born too late and here's to the promise of a life alone you've blessed us with such comfort in knowing love is a dead language  --"love is a dead language" chagall guevara

      i have a Y chromosome  it was a weird moment i just had, a moment of emotional overload.  i'm not entirely sure otherwise how to describe it.  i was in my office and it just sort of felt like i'd come face to face with every single thing in my life that i perceive to be wrong, or maybe not wrong, but less than i want it to be.  i'm at home now, opportune time, around midday, because i'd probably have come home for lunch anyway.  it was weird, i wanted to get out of there as fast as i could and probably take part in some sort of anesthetizing behavior.  it was one of those moments where you want to cry, but you can't.  jim goad wrote about something like this once, he said:   I wish I could cry, but men are weaned from crying to the point where they become incapable of it. I'm convinced that men live shorter lives primarily because we're not allowed to cry. Boys can do it, but it's eventually beaten out of you, often literally. Men just have to bite down and swallow and let it ravage their innards. Women, well, they bawl at everything. They cry at yellow lights and raindrops and misplaced shopping coupons. They're especially good at crying when you need to cry and can't.   i dunno if i don't cry because i feel like i'm not allowed, i definitely don't feel like i shouldn't because of any kind of external constraint.  i suspect in my case the weaning was way more covert than it was overt, and that jim is right.    my innards definitely feel ravaged, and as i'm reading over the rest of this entry, i'm  realizing that i'm not as bad off as i seem to be sounding, that i'm in better shape than i'm letting on.  i'm not sad or anything or upset, or pissed, or devastated or anything like that, i just want an emotional release and right now i seem to be getting everything but that.  feeling: emotionally overloaded thinking of: immersion music: "hope to carry on" caedmon's call

      so today's one of those days.  at least as far as writing goes, there's some stuff i kinda want to write about, but it's a bit more substantial than anything i really feel in the mood to write about right this second.  in fact, i think i've felt like that for a little while now, and i guess it's a bit evident, given that short entries have proliferated, thursday seems to have become lyrics day, and there was the political ad bit from the ticket, which still makes me laugh.    i'm mexican, so it could be laziness.  i tried really hard to stay away from that one, it seemed too easy, but it doesn't seem like much is coming easily.  i guess that could be a reason why i haven't really felt like writing "deeply" at all, i just haven't wanted to put forth the effort it'd take to do that.  that probably has a bit to do with the time of day i normally write, in the mornings before work, and it's just been easier lately to use that time to wake up mentally as opposed to trying to do anything intellectually or emotionally substantive.  i don't feel  too  bad about it, i mean i'm still writing, and i don't feel like i'm mailing it in, and i'm pretty sure i'll write about the stuff that i seem to have put on the back burner whenever i'm ready, whenever the time's right, or more right anyway, so i don't guess that it is laziness.  take away my lawnmower, though, and i'd be unemployed.  feeling: disappointed and frail and detached thinking of: apathy music: the chili's baby back ribs song

      so i was sick over the weekend.  not really  really  sick, i talked about that a bit on friday, i wasn't totally bedridden or anything, but i felt pretty cruddy.  cruddy enough, in fact, that i took some medicine, some sudafed.  i don't normally take medicine, i think it's the hardass side of my personality wanting to break the stereotype of the guy who turns into a total sissy whenever the slightest hint of physical illness rears its head.  anyways, taking medicine leads to it's whole own set of issues, especially with something like sudafed which makes you feel like your blood's been replaced with mountain dew, or something fizzy and loaded with caffeine anyway.  i guess now is the time i should mention that whenever i went to college, i pretty much gave up caffeine, so any time it ends up in my system, it screws with me, probably as much as crack would fool with a normal person.  the cup of tea that i had each night probably didn't help with anything as far as that went.  saturday and sunday night, i was so hopped up from all the foreign substances coarsing their way through my bloodstream that even though i had the desire to go to sleep around midnight, around ten, actually, there was no way that my chemical taskmasters would have allowed that.  i swear it turned me into some sort of superhuman, i think if i ever took that stuff when i  wasn't  sick, i'd go days, maybe weeks without sleep.  even being sick, i didn't go to sleep until sometime around two and felt more than awake when i popped out of bed around half past six.  chipper even.  it was scary, i felt like a mutant.  feeling: better thinking of: lotion music: "after midnight" patsy cline

      i don't feel so good.  mostly it's sinus stuff, though i do feel a bit nauseous too. i don't guess this entry will be anything for the faint of heart, so consider yourselves forwarned.  i woke up this morning and my face hurt, mostly because, i guess over the course of the night, my nose had turned into a faucet.  the good news is that whatever's coming out isn't green or yellow or any other weird color, so there's no sinus infection or anything like that.  i don't think i'm getting sick or anything like that, i felt better after my shower, which is usually a pretty good indication that i won't feel terrible all day.  i may not feel tip-top, but i'll be functional.  that seems to be about as sick as i've gotten in the past few years, the last time i got really sick was three or four years ago when i got the flu for a day and a half.  that was awful, it absolutely rocked me for about 36 hours straight, it was the kind of thing where any movement that i tried to make jarred my whole body.  the only things i could do were get up to drink water and use the bathroom, other than that, the task of moving just wasn't worth it.  the good thing about that time was that it was gone as soon as it showed up, like i said, just 36 hours.  i'm about due for another one like that, so i'm knocking on wood.  feeling: perseverant thinking of: pictures music: "the bedroom again" reverend horton heat

      ryan seacrest must die.  i watch more tv than i probably should, in fact some days i get to thinking that  any  tv is too much and that i'm just feeding the desire that i have to be passively entertained.  one of the bad habits i've picked up is that whenever i get home from work, one of the first two or three things that i do is locate the remote and turn on the tv.   it didn't use to be that way, in the past i'd be able to show enough restraint to wait at least an hour or so until the simpsons came on.  the trouble started when i got cable and discovered that "walker, texas ranger" came on at five, and became compounded when fox put "king of the hill" on at the same time.  i've still got walker to contend with, but what fox has done with their five o'clock slot is nearly enough to sour me on tv.  it would be bad enough if they took king of the hill off in favor of "dharma and greg" or some stupid shite like that, but no, their designs were far more sinister, because now we get that douchebag of the highest degree, ryan seacrest.  the commercials i saw for his show were, i thought, pretty innocuous, i thought it was pretty funny that he said the show would be "dangerous".  what's so dangerous about a hollywood studio where an irrelevant, freshly finished with puberty dj turned talk show host fraternizes with the spare celebs who can't get on with wayne brady or regis and kelly, i sill haven't figured out.    i think if someone were someone to force me into the studio audience for a taping of that show,  that  would be dangerous.  feeling: pensive thinking of: elvis presley music: "into the dark" the juliana theory

      so me and bone were talking about cure alls the other day.  it's a pretty easy thing to think about, perhaps even daydream about; especially in a "wow my life would kick so much more ass if i had *this* or *that*" or whatever sort of way.  he suggested pondering money, specifically in the amount $40 billion as an adequate cure-all and then listed some of the things that he thought he would do with that kinda sum.  i was hard pressed to disagree with him, $40 billion would put an end to a lot of the frustrations that i perceive at this point of my life, but my gut feeling is that if i'm expecting a sudden infusion of $40 billion to somehow solve my problems, and that i'm also somehow expecting myself to do things then that i could be doing now simply because i'd have money then, i'll be let down, disappointed.  so the money doesn't really do it for me, i'm sort of a rustic anyway, and to be really honest, i'm not sure anything that i'd consider a "cure-all" exists, i s'pose i should have prefaced this entry with that particular statement.  that's not at all to say that i don't wish that i could have things that i don't have now or that i don't ever wish that my life could be somehow different, or even that i don't believe stuff like that would improve my life.  so i was pretty intrigued when i stumbled upon   urlLink this here article   which is sort of a personality wish-list, in fact that's what the article's entitled.  my list would most definitely be different, i'd rather rid myself of my genitals with dull and rusty kitchen utensils than be jim rome, and it made me think of how fragile my identity is and how i've so carefully crafted it based on what i perceive in the personalities of those i admire, those i wish that i could be like.  dvd box set for whoever can guess the top five on my list, lunch is on me if you can guess three.  feeling: better though "not so good" is mounting a counteroffensive thinking of: the letter i got yesterday that made my day, and the phone call that made it better music: "no cigar" millencolin

      if i hear the word(s) "low carb" again someone's gonna pay, i swear someone's gonna pay.  with the way that people are avioiding carbs, you'd think they carried the herpes or somesuch, but even herpes seems to carry less stigma than do the dreaded carbs right now.  if you need proof just look at the valtrex commercials that are on like half a dozen times every hour where people with herpes are shown doing all kinds of neat stuff like hang-gliding and rock-climbing, and probably all manner of other hyphenated activities.  where was i??  herpes?  oh that's right, carbs, worse yet.  so anyways, it's like the latest thing, low-carb this, low-carb that, even fast food joints are getting in on the whole thing, trading in burgers and sandwiches for these new lettuce wraps that don't give people herpes like i'd imagine the buns used on the burgers and sandwiches do.  it's pretty hilarious actually, carl's jr has got this new six dollar wrap that's pretty much just a big-ass slab of ground beef that comes wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun, i think the last thing i'd want to do with something like that is eat it.  that bastard dr. atkins is to blame, and if he wasn't already dead, i'd be plotting his demise for sure.  so people are terrified of bread and horrfied by pasta because they make people fat.  it's stupid, mostly because even though those  are  carbs, and consuming too many carbs  can  lead to being overweight or difficulty in losing weight, but the problem isn't the fact that burgers or sandwiches have too many carbs in the way of bread, it's that people can't stop stuffing their faces with them.  screw you dr. atkins.  feeling: surly thinking of: too much, and nothing, all at the same time music: "lonely holiday" old 97s

      i used to wrestle.  it's been nearly six years since i stepped on a mat competitively and sometime last week was the first time i stepped on one at all in about two years.  it was in high school, and, looking back, i've noticed that out of all the stuff that i did during that time, if there's anything that defined those years, it was wrestling.  out of the friends that i have from high school that i'm still in touch with, even marginally,  they're all teammates from wrestling.  i mean if you can't bond with someone after saving his hat from letting the vomit of a passed-out drunk teammate soak into it, then what can you bond with someone over?  so anyways, when something's such a significant part of your life for such an extended period of time, you don't really tend to leave it behind, and you notice that you take advantage of opportunities to keep connected to it, not necessarily in the al bundy "this is the ball that i scored four touchdowns with at polk high fifty years ago with" way, even though i think bone mentioned that he thought of me in that way.    in any case, i made it to a high school wrestling meet yesterday that one of the kids in my youth group was wrestling in, and the whole thing was reminiscent of dual meets that i'd been in.  the kid i went to watch wrestles for lakewood and they had dropped the first few matches and gone down like 28-0.  they were down like 31-3 whenever they rolled up to the studs in their line-up, from 125-160, which is whenever they started to get their shite together.  they won six out of the last seven matches, with either four or five of those being pins, i forget how many exactly, to tie up the team score at 34 and since they had the tiebreakers they won.  it sort of  did  make me feel like al bundy.  feeling: worse thinking of: why music: "kiss an angel good morning" charley pride

      there is something i have found  in the hush of the quieting sounds.  on the falling of dusk  and the chirping of crickets  and the slowing fading distance  of this world that's spinning 'round.  it's spinning upright and then upside down,  and as the night bends to cover the day with her kisses.  it's like a lover's benediction  that i'm sending to you now.  if it can reach past the streets of this town,  then you might hear the voice of a heart that's been lifted  by the song the night has given.   buenas noches from nacogdoches.  from me and from every star God lit in the heart  of the heavens that hang over texas.  may your dreams find you in a tangle of fine spanish angels  whose halos are bright yellow roses.  buenas noches.   so this is no lullaby  that i send on the wings of this night.  wings that flutter as silent as goldenrods blooming.  bursting from bud into beauty  in a way I can't describe.  in a way that's so changing my life.  that the holds that once held me  have all now been loosened.  and I can hear the music.   buenas noches from nacogdoches.  from me and from every star God lit in the heart  of the heavens that hang over texas.  may your dreams find you in a tangle of fine spanish angels  whose halos are bright yellow roses.  buenas noches.   --"buenas noches from nacogdoches" kid brothers of st. frank

      so i dig the foot-long turkey breast on wheat.  it's not something you can get in the hood, at least it hadn't been.  i guess this is more redux from my trip to dallas last week and the week before, because one of the things that i noticed was that there were about a dozen new subways in and around the neighborhood i grew up in.  i found it odd, mostly because as far as choices in convenient cuisine, the hood is resigned to burger king, mcdonald's, jack in the box, church's chicken, and every once in a while KFC and wendy's.  i was conflicted, i think i felt the way that white people do whenever the darkies or wetbacks show up in their neighborhoods, but i dig subway, (not half as much as quizno's, but that's another entry for another day) so i was pretty stoked to see them proliferate in that area.  so anyways, i was with my mom, and having flown and left my car in the parking lot at the long beach airport, i was sort of at other peoples' mercy as far as coming and going went.  it was about lunchtime and i was a bit hungry.  i've been on this no fast food kick lately, and doing pretty good on it, since early august i can count on one hand the number of times i've been to a fast food joint, but knowing the options around where we were knew that if i wasn't eating at jack in the box or someplace like that, i wasn't eating at all.  i needed cash, so i had to go to the bank first, the atm anyway, and my bank had one that wasn't too far, and right in the same shopping center there it was, a subway in the middle of the hood, so naturally, i figured i'd be better off going there than to jack in the box.  so i go to subway order my thing, the foot-long turkey breast on wheat and i'm not sure i can adequately describe the disappointment i had.  it was horribly made, and tasted like detergent.  i'm holding jared responsible, any excuse to kick that guy's ass is welcome.  feeling: disconnected thinking of: ashley music: "dead american" lars fredriksen and the bastards

      i have a neat job.  i mean there are days that are tough, when the kids won't shut up and the days that i'm at work for twelve hours or more and the list of things to do never gets shorter and then some kid needs a ride home.  i don't mind any of those things at all, in fact quite enjoy them, it's just that the confluence of all of it sometimes is enough to push a person to the edge of madness.  but there are those other times that the perks really shine through and you get to spend all monday afternoon at a movie screening.  that's what happened yesterday.  i got an invitiation to an advance screening of  The Passion of The Christ , the mel gibson movie that's stirred up so much controversy.  what we saw wasn't the finished movie, the ending wasn't complete, the score hadn't been integrated, so there was placeholder music, and some effects hadn't been put in either, but that didn't really take anything at all away from the experience and definitely took nothing from the story.  right from the beginning, the movie grabs you and doesn't let go.  it's ridiculously poignant and unbelievably violent, i'd never cried in a movie because someone got the living hell beat out of him until seeing this portrayal of the violence Jesus was subjected to.  what makes the story go so far, however isn't necessarily poignancy or depth of the storytelling, the vividness of the images, or even the use of the ancient language, but the context and the knowledge of who was the story and why it unfolded like it did.  mel gibson was there and did a q & a right after the movie ended and listening to him, you could tell that this work was something that he did sincerely, something that, for him, wasn't a career aspiration so much as an act of obedience.  listening to gibson talk about how he'd carried the vision of this film for twelve years before he finally made it and how he couldn't get away from it, and now as it's nearing completion the vision that he has for how it'll affect the people who see it, it's clear that he understands the scope of the story he's telling.  it opens february 25, go see it.  feeling: small thinking of: reality music: "louder than the mob" the o.c. supertones

       second of two , continued from yesterday  i have a degree in sociology.  people that know me know that i'm definitely not one to brandish accolades, in fact, i enjoy the feeling i get when i can tell someone looking at me is thinking that since i'm wearing torn up jeans and have four or five days' worth of growth on my face that i'm sort of an idiot.  but all that's neither here nor there, but it is relevant inasmuch as i was thinking about my trip to dallas and for some reason got to thinking about how it related to certain theoretical perspectives of sociology.  i think the whole thing started last week when i was talking to laura, and started to think about how many times in college i'd talk to her while i was in dallas after cutting out of a day or two of class.  specifically i remember that i missed (well not "missed" so much) my 9:15 social theory class, where i first learned about structural functional theory and conflict theory.  so to the point, being at home was like conflict theory.  marx was the guy who came up with the whole idea of conflict theory and basically the gist of it is that society is in a constant state of upheaval, that comfort levels are, as a rule, very low, and that anomalies occur that see reality reach a state of equilibrium, or for lack of a more adequate term, peacefulness.  i definitely felt like that in dallas.  periods of peacefulness and comfort were more the exception than they were the rule.  there was definitely an increased level of dis-ease for most of the time that i spent in the house, which is where i spent most of my time.  it seemed as though i reached an increased level of statsis whenever i left home, like when i hung out with bone, or dunx and brad, or laura.  i was expressing a bit of confusion yesterday because of some uncertainty about the concept of home.  when i made it back to my apartment thursday morning, i felt like i was walking into the feeling that i thought i should have felt when i walked through the door of the house i grew up in.  starting to think about it, i came to the conclusion that the state of things while i'm here is pretty much the opposite of what it was whenever i was in dallas.  long periods of stability interspersed with the occasional uncomfortable upheaval, which meshes pretty well with durkheim's theoretical perspective of structural-functionalism, which says that the default state of society is stability and stasis and that the exceptions are the instances where that stability is shaken up.   none of this matters, because it was   urlLink weber  , not durkheim or marx, who was right anyway.  feeling: slightly distressed, in spite of myself thinking of: what i'm feeling music: "what trouble are giants" rich mullins

       first of two   i'm home.  or in california, so so much cognitive dissonance as far as that goes.  i forget who i was talking to, but it was brought up that i got two homes now, which i don't s'pose that i'll at all dispute.  i mean my standing out here is quite less tenuous than a student's, but my connection to dallas is still pretty strong.    so anyways, i got back thursday morning, which was a total nightmare, mostly because my flight was at half past eight that morning and i didn't get home from being out on new year's eve until sometime around six, a mere two and a half hours before my flight to long beach was set to leave.  there was no sleeping that night, evidently i spent three hours face down in brad's yard, but everyone knows that just doesn't count, not as sleep anyway.    in any case, new year's was a blast, we met at brad's and went down to deep ellum, hit the bars mostly, we were leaving the first one as the clock struck midnight and wished people happy new year on the street as they walked by.  we saw javy who had the unfortunate task of working, luckily, he was in deep ellum too, at the cafe brazil, so he was able to head back to the alley with us for some champagne.  i s'pose all that lasted til about two before we headed back to brad's.  i'm still not sure where the bruises came from.  feeling: internally duplicitous thinking of: work, if you can believe that music: "fight to live" bouncing souls

      even now your eyes are courting sleep i'll stay by your side as i have always been  sleep tonight, may your dreams reveal my love for you beyond what i must do, do you know my plans for you?  to separate myself from where my treasure lies  then naked in this cold and lonely unforgiving life.  be stripped away of all delusions of the man i'd like to be  at the moment i am broken parts, sure of only weaknesses  with nothing left to show, no illusions left to hide behind.  burning clean has been both agony and absolute release can i hope to pass this test, is my destiny the wilderness?  the hardest part of letting go, is trusting you with everything in laying bare my soul is truly seeing who I really am.  Father what is man that You are mindful of him?  can i pass this test? is my destiny this wilderness?  to stand alone  against a life of wretchedness. impossible to hope and so i plead Your graciousness   show me your glory  may my life reflect your presence and never again find myself in anything less.   --"acquiesce" stavesacre

       ash wednesday   do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility consider others better than yourselves.  each of you should look not only to your own interests, but also to the interests of others.   your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus:   who, being in very nature God,         did not consider equality with God something to be grasped,      but made himself nothing,         taking the very nature of a servant,         being made in human likeness.      and being found in appearance as a man,         he humbled himself         and became obedient to death--            even death on a cross!   philippians 2:5-8  he was despised and rejected by men,  a man of sorrows, and familiar with suffering.  like one from whom men hide their faces  he was despised, and we esteemed him not.   surely he took up our infirmities  and carried our sorrows,  yet we considered him stricken by God,  smitten by him, and afflicted.   but he was pierced for our transgressions,  he was crushed for our iniquities;   the punishment that brought us peace was upon him,  and by his wounds we are healed.   therefore I will give him a portion among the great, and he will divide the spoils with the strong, because  he poured out his life unto death,   and was numbered with the transgressors.  for he bore the sin of many,  and made intercession for the transgressors.   isaiah 53:3-5, 12  i have been so bold as to speak to the Lord, though i am nothing but dust and ashes.  genesis 18:27

      today is sarah's birthday.  i used to live in chicago, in the area anyways and i met a few really neat people while i was there, i met sarah there too :-)  we've known each other about four years and she's a friend, a good friend.  those that know me know what that means and that it's significant.  there's distance now, and that's a bit hard, she's in illinois and i'm out on the fringe of the world known as the west coast, although i'm working really hard to get her out on a visit here sooner than later.  she'll come if she knows what's good for her.  i think that all of us have friends in our lives that sort of make us wonder "how'd i get to be friends, and such good friends, with her?"  sarah's one of those people for me, don't get me wrong, i love her tons and i think she's awesome, but we're way different, different enough that, like i said, i wonder how we got to be so close.  the only think i can think of that really serves as an explanation is that sometimes, certain people are simply thrust into your life and when you look back on the experiences that you've shared with those people, you realize how much richer your life is for it.    me and sarah are like that, because i feel like our friendship grew mostly because of the fact that wherever i went, she was, and wherever she went, i was.  that doesn't always make a difference, there are people i've spent tons more time with that i don't feel a fraction of the affection for, but there are certain people whose presence simply makes life better, and when you spend time with them your care and affection for them grows.  sarah is one of those people, every time i saw her, i liked her more and more.  what's coolest about that is that she realizes the same thing.  one of the things that i value most in the world is a note that she gave me right after i graduated from college and left illinois where she chronicled a lot of the times we spent together and just told me how much they meant to her, and as a result, how much i meant to her.  it's on my nightstand right now, in fact.  sarah's twenty today, and i don't think i could have let this day go by without mentioning it here and once again remembering how amazing she is and how blessed i am to have her in my life.  happy birthday sarah.  feeling: warm thinking of: sarah, it's her day music: "the closest thing" the juliana theory

      even in dating, the brave new world is here.  i was talking to one of my girls not too long ago, she's a high school junior, and she mentioned that there was some guy at school who had been text-messaging her to ask her to go out with him, get a date, whatever.  i don't remember my exact response, but it was along the lines that if the guy didn't have the guts to ask her face to face, then he's not worth her time and he doesn't deserve hers.  i thought about backing off a bit, because when i was that age, i didn't always do that myself, i'd use the phone, which even now, i think is totally reasonable.  but then she told me that this same guy, text-message wonder, wouldn't even acknowledge her when he  did  see her face to face.  it sorta made me wonder, if he had no idea what to say to her whenever he happened to run into her, and was probably even afraid of interaction in that setting, what could he possibly think would happen if she were to say yes, agree to go out on a date with him and have to spend at least a couple of hours with her one on one?  it made me think of something my wrestling coach used to say, and i have no idea of the context into which the question was uttered, but he said "that's like a dog chasing a car, what the hell's he gonna do with it if he catches it?!?"  in fairness, at that age especially, dating is harder for guys than it is for girls, not that it's easy for girls or that the issues faced by either gender are the same, or even comparable, but generally, the males are the pursuers.  it's the guy who goes out on the limb, and it's the guy who has to come up with the plan, the girl is the one with all the discretion.  there's all that and the general rule that guys in high school are pretty much clueless socially.  a dog catching the car he's chasing, that's classic.  feeling: sore in the hamstrings thinking of: text messaging a girl to ask her out music: "three biggest lies" david allan coe

      i'm fascinated by the ways people identify themselves.  kinda like the a-rod entries, this one doesn't seem to fit the pattern of content or style that i seem to have established for what i write here, but i figured if i spent the time and thought on it, i might as well post it here.  so anyways, identity; i think the whole thing started in a sunday school class when i was in sixth grade, the big discussion question that day was this:  does what you do define who you are, or does who you are define what you do?  the easy answer, of course, is the conditioned response.  think about when you introduce someone or when someone introduces you, generally it's name followed by occupation.  beyond the first glance, however, it's a tricky and loaded question, and whichever answer you choose is the one that is true, likely because it's one of those questions that gets right to the core of epistemology, it exegetes a presupposition.  what i mean is that that question forces a person to contemplate what it is that is truly foundational about their essence.  so anyways, what sparked this whole train of thought here was an  urlLink article  that i read a week or so ago about gay marriage, more specifically gay marriage from the viewpoint of homosexual clergy.  to be really honest, i'm fantastically ambivalent about the whole thing, i mean my opinion is what it is and all i'll say here is that i don't support a constitutional amdenment that would define marriage, but how the whole thing is fleshed out is what i'm particularly ambivalent about, at least in the political sense.  back to the point, what fascinated me in reading this article is the disparity in the significance of sexual orientation in defining identity between heterosexual people and homosexual people.  orientation, however, is only where the whole thing starts, because in the whole debate, what people are seeking is the right to have behavior, not simply orientation, legitimized and sanctioned by the state.  the cultural shift that's paved the way for this is due, in large part, to a couple of particular developments.  first, there's the fact that autonomy has been anointed by our culture as chief among the virtues, bascially that means that the validity of actions based on individual personal convictions are, in the vast majority, not to be taken to task.  in our culture, infringing on someone's right to make their own decision borders on the unconscionable.  there's that, as well as the inflated status that sex has been ascribed in our perceived hierarchy of needs.  the train of thought here goes that since sex is an entirely natural act, it should be part of every human being's experience with little to no regard given to context, that it's an urge that needs to be heeded as a prerequisite for healthy survival, kinda like the urges for food or water.  basically, the idea that anyone can live without or that anyone should be expected to be able to live without sex is unthinkable.  so based on that, i don't find it curious that secular culture is working with a playbook that puts such a high value on sex, or more specifically, sexual behavior, as a component of identity.  i  did  however, find it curious that Christian theologians would look at the Bible and at theology in a manner that was so skewed to a single aspect of identity.  make no mistake, i as much as or more than anyone, realize that when people do theology or interpret scripture they do so with potentially numerous and glaring biases that permeate their efforts, regardless of any attempt to remain "objective," but i was amazed that these "queer" theologians profiled in the article made sex so central to their work.  now i've been influenced by our culture sufficiently enough that i won't begrudge nearly anybody his or her choice as far as how they define themselves or what they want out of life.  however, i'm savvy enough to understand that the secular culture's premium on autonomy as well as its understanding of sex has permeated the church and i'm feisty enough to consider that unacceptable.  flannery o'connor puts a finer point on it than i ever could saying:   the writer who emphasizes spiritual values is very likely to take the darkest view of all what he sees in this country today.  for him, the fact that we are the most powerful and the wealthiest nation in the world doesn't mean a thing in any positive sense.  the sharper the light of faith, the more glaring are apt to be the distortions of the life the writer sees around him.  my own feeling is that writers who see by the light of their own christian faith will have, in these times, the sharpest eyes for the grotesque, the perverse, the unacceptable.  the novelist with christian concerns will find in modern life distortions which are repugnant to him, and his problem will be to make these appear as distortions to an audience which is used to seeing them as natural.   o'connor's quote is spot on as far as it goes, what's most unfortunate about it, however, is that it currently doesn't go far enough.  feeling: recovered thinking of: glutamine music: "faking life" five iron frenzy

      well i was workin on my farm, about 1982 pullin up some corn and a little carrot too when a low-flyin aeroplane, about a hundred feet high dropped a buncha bales of somethin, some hit me in the eye.  so i cut a bale open and man was i surprised a buncha large white baggies and big white rocks inside so i took a little sample to my crazy brother joe, he sniffed it up and kicked his heels and said "horton that's some blow!!"  bales of cocaine fallin from low flyin planes i don't know who done dropped em, but i'll take em just the same bales of cocaine fallin like a pourin rain my life changed completely by a low flyin plane.  so i loaded up them bales in my pick-em-up truck headed west to dallas, where i would try my luck. i didn't have a notion if i could sell em there, and thirty minutes later, i was a millionaire.  bales of cocaine fallin from low flyin planes i don't know who done dropped em, but i'll take em just the same bales of cocaine fallin like a pourin rain my life changed completely by a low flyin plane.  and now i am a rich man, but i'm still a farmer too, but i sold my farm in texas, bought a farm down in peru and when i get so homesick, i think i'm goin insane,  i travel back to texas in a low-flyin plane.  bales of cocaine fallin from low flyin planes i don't know who done dropped em, but i'll take em just the same bales of cocaine fallin like a pourin rain my life changed completely by a low flyin plane.  --"bales of cocaine" reverend horton heat

      second of two, continued from yesterday.  so, like i said, it's a tough time to be a ranger fan.  i mentioned the losing and the mismanagement, and even though the losing's a drag, knowing that the whole thing is being haphazardly and carelessly taken care of makes the whole thing about a million times worse.  the funny thing about people in charge of such a public enterprise doing a crappy job is that they don't want anyone to know that they're doing a crappy job, even funnier is that they think no one  will  know they're doing a crappy job if they just tell everyone they're not.  the way they figured they'd do that is by casting doubt on a-rod's desire to be in texas, making him out to be the one who really wanted out.  in all reality, a-rod likely did want out.  when he signed his quarter-billion dollar contract management gave him the impression that the team was in position to contend for the playoffs, which, despite the last place finish the year previous, wasn't a huge strecth since they'd been division champions three out of the four years before that; and that they were going to remain commited to having the kind of payroll that would enable them to stay in that position.  so basically what ensues is that a-rod has the rug pulled out from under him because after huckleberry and snaggle puss gave millions to retreads like ken caminiti, andres galarraga, todd van poppel, and jay powell, millions more to guys that end up getting hurt like rusty greer and jeff zimmer man, and still millions more to scrubs that just aren't any good like chan-ho park, the team's losing continues, fans stop coming, huckleberry hicks starts losing money and decides to slash payroll.  so once it's clear the teams gonna suck for a while longer, rumors start to float that maybe a-rod's not the happiest to be here, you know because of the losing and that he and the team would both be better off if he and his contract were shipped off to boston or someplace.  at that point the seed's planted that a-rod's contract is the sole reason that the team sucks and that they had to get rid of pudge and raffy as well as the reason they're not able to sign any free agents, and as a result fans are pissed at a-rod, telling him not to let the door hit him where the good lord split him, which is just idiocy.  i'm not an a-rod fan, not by any stretch really, but i think it sucks to see him, the best player i've ever seen play the game and a guy who showed up every day and did his job like a professional, leave the team i grew up cheering for.  people can piss and moan about him not wanting to be in texas or whatever, but i'll take a guy like him who's doing his job, and doing it exceptionally well, even if he doesn't  really  want to be here over ten guys who really want to be there and aren't doing their job.  there, i've vented my spleen.  feeling: unburdened thinking of: stretching music: "**** with me and find out" wesley willis

      first of two  it's a tough time to be a ranger fan.  i don't talk often or much about sports, not here anyways, so i s'pose today will be a bit of a departure from that, mostly because of all the big stuff that's going on with the rangers lately.  having grown up in dallas, i've always had a bit of a soft spot for the local teams.  even after being out of the area nearly six years, i still follow all the same teams i did when i was a kid, although i don't guess there's anything remarkable about that.  the first sport i ever played in life was baseball, i think i was seven when i signed up for t-ball at the Y, and i'm pretty sure a big reason for why i did that was because the summer before i'd discovered the rangers on channel 11.    so i'm still a ranger fan, in fact, out of all the hometown allegiances i've developed, the one i have to the rangers is strongest.  not that i'm necessarily fair-weathered as far as the other teams go, i could name nearly every one of the rag-tag bunch of scrubs the mavericks ran out for most of the 90's, which means i can tell you who tim legler is, or mike izzulino, or greg dreiling, or darren morningstar, or bruno sundov, well you get the point.  similarly, i followed the cowboys when they were 1-15 and alternately known as troy aikman and a bunch of guys named broderick, back when a loss by less than three touchdowns was considered a good game.  those teams would lose, and sometimes they'd lose a lot and i didn't like it, somehow, however, when the rangers were winning i cared just a little bit more and when they lost, it hit me just a little bit harder.  so the last four years have been pretty rough on the team, four straight last-place finishes and the whole thing's been pretty abysmal.  what's most maddening about the whole thing is that complete ridiculousness of the level of mismanagement that the team's been subject to, which is to say that they'd be better off with huckleberry hound and snaggle puss at the helm than tom hicks (owner) and john hart (general manager), giving huge guaranteed contracts to guys who have showed up only to absolutely suck and end up, for all intents and purposes, stealing money and letting productive guys go in the name of payroll flexibility.  anyways, over the weeekend they got rid of alex rodriguez which i guess for the past few months has been more a matter of "how" and "when" than it's been a matter of "if."  ironically this pretty much more than undid the only sound baseball decision those dopes have made in several years.  what's most sickening about it is the near total disregard for the intelligence of the fans who've spent their money supporting the team on the part of hicks and hart.  once again, they invoke the payroll flexibility deal, which basically means that since they pretty much screwed the team by giving outrageous contracts to guys who totally blow they subsequently have to get rid of the guy with the biggest contract, who ironically is the only one with a substantial contract who was earning his check.  next year, the proverbial "next year," seems forever away,  feeling: cheated thinking of: the ghost of charlie hough's knuckleball music: "guilty by association" steve taylor

      sometimes, i'm astounded by my own self-ignorance.  specifically i'm thinking of things that i've learned in the past, and then had to re-learn, and then re-learn, and then re-learn again.  the whole thing's been particularly real lately in a couple of ways.  i mentioned the other day that i've been frustrated with some stuff and that frustration's led to a real lack of emotional energy.  i've also been at a bit of a low-ebb as far as my level of physical energy goes.  anyways, you know how the conventional wisdom goes whenever you're feeling that way.  you're so worn out that you don't want to expend any more energy, because given how you're feeling, to do so would seem to be fantastic folly.  nothing else is working though, you try going to sleep a bit earlier and it just serves to make you groggy in the morning because it screws with your natural clock.  maybe you withdraw a bit from people around you because you lack the energy interaction would require, but that just leads to increased isolation, which drains you even more, and then you're at your wits' end, and in that moment you realize the utter uselessness of holding on to whatever it is you're holding on to.  so anyways, i wrote an email to a friend.  it wasn't a long one by any stretch, and to be honest even that was a really hard thing to do, not because i didn't want to or anything like that, but because it was so difficult for me to tear myself away from the idea that i didn't have anything at all to give, even something as easy as writing an email.  i get the feeling that we've all been there.  there was that and the hour-long cardio workout that i did yesterday.  neither of those are things that are revolutionary in as much as i'd done them both before, and there's truly nothing at all spectacular about writing a two or three sentence email or spending an hour with an elevated heart rate.    maddening and rewarding all at the same time was the fact that i knew that making the effort to write that email and taking that hour to workout, despite the threats they posed to my immediate comfort, offered me sources of energy that i wasn't able to easily perceive prior to making that effort.  i'm here now in a way better state of mind, and less worn out emotionally, mentally and physically than i was before.   i am a bit sore tho.  feeling: better thinking of: tiger balm music: "blank" value pac

      it's been rough and rocky travelin, but I'm finally standin upright on the ground.  after taking several readings, i'm surprised to find my mind's still fairly sound,  i thought nashville was the roughest, but i know i said the same about them all,  we received our education in the cities of the nation, me and paul.  almost busted in laredo, but for reasons that i'd rather not disclose, but if you're stayin in a motel there and leave, just don't leave nothin in your clothes.  and at the airport in milwaukee, they refused to let us board the plane at all.  they said we looked suspicious, but i believe they liked to pick on me and paul.  on a package show in buffalo, with us and kitty wells and charley pride, the show was long and we was just sitting there, and we'd come to play and not just for the ride,  and we drank a lot of whiskey, so i don't know if we went on that night at all.  but i don't think they even missed us, i guess buffalo ain't geared for me and paul  it's been rough and rocky travelin, but I'm finally standin upright on the ground.  after taking several readings, i'm surprised to find my mind's still fairly sound,  i thought branson was the roughest, but i know i said the same about them all,  we received our education in the cities of the nation, me and paul.  --"me and paul" willie nelson

      "how's your soul?" he would ask.  that was the first thing  urlLink lyle dorsett  ever asked me.  well maybe not ever, but the first time i sat in his office to talk with him one-on-one, before i was fully in the chair, those three words rang, somewhat startlingly, in my ears.  i didn't know what to make of that question, i mean who starts a conversation like that?  his way was so disarming though, and on top of that he exuded such a sense of authority that it didn't really matter what he was asking, he was the kind of guy whose question you simply  had  to answer.    it seemed as though he had the ability to convey in his asking of that question, or any question, the sense that he wasn't asking to put you on the spot as much as he was asking because the answer you'd give really mattered to him.  come to find out that question wasn't a sort of one-time engagement, he asked it everytime i sat down to talk with him.  i don't remember what i told him that first time, but i know that that he asked me that question frequently enough to get a pretty wide variety of responses.  no one's asked me that in a while, and i really feel like i'm worse off for it.  to be really honest, i'm not sure there's anybody in my life that's close at hand that i feel would have the kind of authority and care and relationship for that question to go as far now as it did then.  i guess that part of growing up is making the sort of adjustments that minimize the absence of a presence like that.  sooner or later though, you notice.  feeling: the need for a release of endorphins thinking of: second floor, billy graham center music: "ball and chain" social distortion

      i like my first name.  i s'pose i should clarify, i like the easy nickname that my first name lends itself to, and i guess i owe that to my given first name.  the name i was born with is "enrique," but nobody's called me that since before i knew how to tie my shoes.  when i moved out here, there were some people who used it; some who were simply uninformed and the misguided souls who thought that since it was on my birth certificate it's what i should be called.  people would say it, and i wouldn't even know to look up.   anyways, the name i dig is "riqui," that might not be my "name," but whether it is or not, i feel like it's the most adequate one word description of me.  my mom is to thank for the spelling, which cuts both ways, there are people who have known me for a while who still struggle with the spelling, as well as the complication of having to spell it for the uninitiated.    the cool thing about it is that i can sign something with just my first name and people know exactly who it is.  feeling: like a broken bone with a solid splint thinking of: office conversation with drs dorsett and kang, and how much i could use one of those now music: "beautiful day" U2

      the phone rang at six this morning.  you know how it is, you're thinking to yourself: "this  must  be a dream," because to anybody who cares anything at all about you, calling at that hour is unthinkable and borders on unconscionable.  the confusion was compounded by the fact that the focal point of the dream that i had last night was a ringing phone.  even stranger than all that is the fact that i rarely, and i mean  rarely  wake up with even the slightest recollection of having dreamt.  while i was out running some errands today, there was a phrase that stuck out in my mind.  it kept repeating itself over and over again, it was significant, significant enough that i wrote it down.  basically the thought was that there are a lot of things in my life that aren't what i want them to be.  that doesn't bug me so much, anybody'd be hard-pressed to recall a time when everything in life was what they wanted it to be.  i'm not sure really what else i want to say.  i'm not at all sure why i remembered dreaming last night.  i've been pretty frustrated with some stuff lately and though that's not the most fun, it's not the frustration that's really bothering me as much as the feeling that i get that i'm not dealing with it in the most effective way does.  the whole dream thing was more or less me searching for someone to hold responsible for all that i perceive to be lacking in my life, and not even searching so much as assigning.  maybe it  is  totally someone else's fault and i'm just a sucker.  feeling: in urgent need of advice thinking of: why teresa strasser quit "while you were out" music: "white days" the juliana theory

      i used to move furniture.    i've done a lot of crappy jobs, by crappy i mean that the moving job was just one of several that i've had that are really just the kind that a person does during high school and college to make a bit of extra money.  none of them are at all anything that you  want  to do, you do them because you'd rather not choose between putting gas in the car or going grocery shopping or you just don't want to bug your parents for money.  when i say "done" a lot of crappy jobs, i mean worked at, although i'm sure that i've done lots of work that could be qualitatively described as "crappy," my grades in high school can attest to that.  i don't guess that that's either here or there, but maybe if i'd made better grades then i could have scored an internship or something a bit less menial.  to be really honest, even though i'm describing them as crappy jobs, i quite enjoyed all of them, but then maybe that's because they fall victim to a sort of enhanced and romanticized memory syndrome.  there was the maintenance man deal that i did during the summers in high school making five bucks an hour.  it was rough, and some days it was ridiculous, like the day we had to dig an eighty yard trench in 105 degree heat, but i think if i hadn't spent those summers doing that, me and dunx probably wouldn't be the friends that we are.  i delivered pizza which was cool, which basically entailed me getting paid to drive my car, the hours were crappy, but the money was really good, i'd never make less than twelve bucks an hour and on a good night i'd clear twenty an hour easily.  other that that, there was the summer i worked at 7-11, not behind the counter, that woulda been sweet, but their corporate headquarters is in dallas, so i worked in the office there, sorting and filing, it was postitively mind-numbing.    so then there was the moving.  it wasn't like any of the other ones, mostly because i wasn't locked in to a schedule with it.  i knew a guy who had a truck and whenever he had a job and needed help, he'd give me a call.  there was that and the fact that he paid fifteen bucks an hour and in cash, which, even though he was kind of a jerk, made him my favorite person quite frequently.  one job that i did for him was a two day job, in which the first day was twelve hours and the second day was another four hours.  i made nearly three hundred dollars on that job, most of which could be used discretionarily, so i decided to put a cd player in my car.  given my pretty soild distaste for pretty much anything on the radio, which on my somewhat frequent dallas to chicago trips would be compounded by the fact that the airwaves for the duration of the trip were filled with little more than third rate country music, i figured that it would be a pretty reasonalble expense.   that's pretty much exactly what it's turned out to be.  it's played my cds for going on five years now, sparing me the chore of wading through cruddy radio station after cruddy radio station in search of a song that doesn't absolutely suck, and ensuring that i would the only radio i'd listen to would be from  urlLink America's favorite radio station  which i can only do in the car in dallas anyway.  here lately though, it's not been cooperating with me, and it's been arbitrarily spitting my cds back out on arbitrary, but consistent occasions.  i've tried the lens cleaner and everything like that, and nothing's worked.  i don't really want to replace it, but i'm at a loss as to what else will get it to work.  at least i don't have to move furniture to get a new one.  feeling: strained thinking of: ashley music: "bob" NOFX

      i'm not a prude.  that seems like an awfully curious statement to make to start a blog entry, especially for me.  it seems pretty defensive like i'm getting ready to tell you why i'm not a prude.  that'll come later, or it may not, i haven't decided yet.  anyways, there was a football game on yesterday, the first twenty minutes or so was giving me flashbacks to those baylor-rice debacles i spent my saturday mornings watching as a youngster.  no reason to worry though, because it actually turned out to be a hell of a game, the first one i watched from start to finish this year, in fact.  that's not what caused all the buzz around the game, the event, whatever, this morning because the general public decided that a tit, er a breast, was so fascinating so as to detract from the reason everyone was paying attention in the first place.  i actually wasn't around for the halftime show, out of all the times i've watched the super bowl, i think i've seen the halftime show exactly one time, the one with U2 where bono was wearing that jacket lined with the american flag, so i didn't see the whole thing.    the whole thing's unfortunate really, a pity, because like i said, the game was tip-top.  it's more than a pity actually, it's all pretty ridiculous, the people who are the most pissed about it, because it was indecent or whatever, are just calling more attention to it by complaining.  but even they're not as irritating as the milquetoast "progressive" types who crow about it just being a body part.  the point that they miss is context, because here's the thing, if i want to see a tit, i know where to look to find one.  it doesn't particularly bother me that justin timberlake essentially took off janet jackson's shirt, but there are people who most definitely don't appreciate something like that and i can see how they would be pissed because of the fact that they don't expect to see stuff like that in that particular context.  the people complaining are entirely justified in doing so, the only thing they don't realize is that no one cares what they think and people care even less the louder they get.  the one thing the most strident members of both groups have in common is that they've likely never seen one in real life without having to exchange currency for the experience.  feeling: shafted thinking of: older women music: "baddest mother f*cker" david allan coe

      a sports fan was sitting in the top row at the super bowl, barely able to see the field.    he noticed a vacant seat about 3 rows back on the 50-yard line. it was still vacant when the second quarter started, so he went down and asked the man seated next to it if anyone was sitting there.    the man said "no, have a seat." a few minutes later he asked the man if he knew whose seat this was and why they weren't here at such an important event. the man said that for ten years it had been his wife's seat but that she had passed away.  feeling sorry for the nice man, the fan asked if he didn't have a friend or family member that he could have offered the seat to instead of just leaving it vacant.   the man said "no, they're all at the funeral."  *****  john madden was in charlotte to announce a football game when he noticed a special telephone near the panthers bench. he asked jake delhomme what it was used for and was told it was a hotline to God. john asked if he could use it.  jake told him, "sure, but it will cost you $100."  john scratched his head, then thought, "hey, I could use some help picking games." he pulled out his wallet and paid $100. john's picks were perfect that week.   the next week john was in st louis when he noticed that same kind of phone on the rams bench.  he asked what the telephone was for and marc bulger told him, "it's a hotline to God. if you want to use it, it will cost you $500." recalling the previous week, john pulled out his wallet and made the call.  john's picks were perfect again that week.    the next weekend john was in dallas when he noticed the same kind of telephone by the cowboys bench. he asked quincy carter "is that the hotline to God?"  quincy said, "yes, and if you want to use it, it will cost you 35 cents."  john looked incredulously at quincy and said, "wait a second, i just paid $100 in charlotte and $500 in st louis to use the same phone to God! why do the cowboys only charge 35 cents?"  quincy looked at john and replied, "in texas, it's a local call."

      so there's wisdom everywhere.  the somewhat troublesome thing about that is that there's a certain level of wisdom required in knowing when and where to seek it.  sometimes stuff in life works to bring you to a point where you, maybe not reach the end of your rope, but you just sorta realize that there's not just a whole lot you can do to help yourself, at least in the sort of self-reliant way that you've been so conditioned to accept.    there's tons of people that i've met who are smarter than me, hard to believe i know.  going a bit farther, however, the number of people who've got the kind of wisdom that just sort of illuminates in a way that's helpful has been smaller.  i've felt the need lately to seek out that sort of help, mostly because i've just felt that i could gain the kind of insight i've felt lacking.    there was clarity too, i kinda felt like i needed some of that, so i called randy.  i've written about adam, not too long ago either, in fact, and the mentor he was to me and stuff like that, well randy is adam's dad, who i also worked with when i was in illinois.  he's just one of those guys that when you hear his voice, he just  sounds  wise.  what was really cool about talking to him is how i could nearly literally hear his influence on me in that conversation.  i told him what was up and when he evaluated the situation the stuff that came out of his mouth was nearly verbatim what i had been thinking.  since i know the character this guy has and the level of integrity with which he carries himself, i could see his fingerprints all over the development of  my  character which isn't so much a tribute to me as it is to him, i think.  so now i'm fairly certain about where to look.  feeling: humble thinking of: loose change music: "see the lite" sorta

      so it was great.  i'm back now, the weekend was great, seeing annie was awesome, everything i'd hoped it'd be.  i picked her up on friday evening, in azusa.  if you know anything about geography out here, driving from long beach up to azusa around five on friday evening would be at or near the bottom of anyone's list of fun things to do.  so yah, traffic was horrible, and missing the exit to get on the 605 on the way back didn't help any.  anyways, we just sorta kicked back on friday night, which was relaxing.  annie is one of those people who i can be with and not say anything at all and not have it be all weird and crap.  the weather the whole weekend was gorgeous, which was pretty schweet cause we went down to huntington beach on saturday and then drove up to santa barbara on sunday.  i've lived here over a year and a half and hadn't ever been to santa barbara.  annie had a relation, second cousin, i think, out there and she wanted to see westmont, one of the colleges she got into, so we headed up there on sunday afternoon.  santa barbara's a lil over a hundred miles from my front door, which on a sunday afternoon meant around two and a half hours of driving, and even though i had to get there and back all on sunday, the company was good, and the road trip addict in my hasn't been satisfied in quite a while, so i was pretty stoked to do it, and man, was it ever beautiful, hills overlooking the ocean, gorgeous trees and flowers, just amazing.  so we spent most of the afternoon and evening there, annie stayed there that night, and like i said, i drove back that evening and the trip back was so peaceful and i got to spend that time just being reminded of how cool it is to be around someone who really knows you.  feeling: lucky thinking of: CA 101 music: "august in bethany" the juliana theory

      on a desert road that steamed the sky with the windows up and the air on high.  i was off the stage, i was on the mend for a solo drive and a holiday weekend.  my thirsty car came to a stop at the reptile gardens curio shop.  when a wind came hissing through the vents my forehead broke in a cold, cold sweat and in the rear-view mirror was a silhouette  then i heard the doorlocks take a dive and a whisper screamed "don't turn around, just drive!"  scratch! pointy tail and a horn-rimmed head and a widow's peak like eddie munster.  i sat frozen in my seat we haven't had a chance to meet. are you a singing telegram or something?  he just flashed a hellish smile--"let's go driving for a while."  he held something in his hands i'd never seen before. it was my chevrolet's pink slip.  scratch! evil eye, "step on it boy, if you wanna stay alive!" he said "don't look surprised, you know what i want i've lived for years inside your trunk, so drive!" he said. "let's get talking business son, you ain't fooling anyone i know just what you wanna be, now it's time to work for me!  so drive!"  if this is a nasty dream. i'd prefer to wake up here i believe the point is clear.  scratch! outta my car! he said "ha, i've come too far, besides, i kinda like the velour seat covers." God, help me, what do i do, he said "shut up boy, it's too late for you!  now drive! all you phonies get it wrong, double lives take half as long should have kept your windows clean, now i'm part of this machine, so drive!"  you've got a good eighty thousand miles left. . .before the recall.  if this is a nasty dream i believe the point's quite clear i'd prefer to wake up here  i started humming amazing grace he said "come on boy gimme a break!" so i hit the brakes with both my feet,  and sent two horns through the bucket seats.  then the locks shot up as the grace came down. i said "here's the keys, i'll be walkin back to town."  --"drive, he said" steve taylor

      meaning fascinates me.  so anyways, i've written about sociology here before, just some real basic stuff, mostly about theoretical perspectives and my tendency to observe and perceive the world around me using lenses that seem to correspond to those perspectives.  i remember sitting in my urban sociology class and later in my social theory class and hearing about the symbolic interactionist or interpretive theory and suddenly feeling like the entire world made sense.  basically what that perspective is concerned with is meaning, how people perceive the world around them, how the specific things they see and hear and subsequently and interact with are assigned their value.  what really blew my mind was when the reality that what we read and hear as words are no more than mere symbols in and of themselves.  that is to say that  the essence  of something as clear as what i'm writing this very second is not at all what is seen and processed by your eyes and your mind; even though we see and hear symbols and representations that are identical, the nuances of meaning that those same representations and symbols convey to us are not always perceived identically.  so i'm writing about all this because i've been a bit frustrated with the process of interpretation, trying to understand what it is that people mean when i'm pretty sure that we percieve things in radically different ways.  maybe it's not that, maybe it's more than that and i'm just frustrated because i suspect that people aren't shooting straight with me, which if it's the case puts integrity as opposed to misunderstanding at stake, which is far more serious.  i'll stop, i'm getting tired of this already.  feeling: a spinning head. thinking of: clarity music: "faith like a child" jars of clay

      i bowl.  or i used to, it seemed that the last summer me, dunx and brad were all in dallas, summer 2000 i think, and it seemed as though we made it to either don carter's or the bronco bowl or someplace like that no less often than every other week or so.  we did it often enough that i got pretty good at it, but after that summer i think i can count the times i went on a couple or three fingers.  so i guess i still do bowl.  i'm in a class anyway, there's a bit of a story behind it, and it's dumb, so i'll spare you, plus it's the kind of thing that might take away from the aura of invincibility that i work so hard to promote and protect for myself as well as the good of the general public, but i digress.  so anyways, this class meets tuesdays and thursdays and though it's through long beach city college, it meets at a bowling alley on PCH, which i guess makes sense, seeing as there's no bowling alley on campus.    i only go on tuesdays, mostly because that's league day and thursdays are just for practice.  our team's actually pretty good, we have the second lowest handicap in the league, but we're not very consistent, and we're not so much better than everyone else that we don't get screwed by handicaps every once in a while.  like as a team our handicap is right at 150, mine is 48, and the other guys' are 60 and 42.  the ball i use is pink.  feeling: scatterbrained thinking of: summer 2000 music: "big D boogie woogie" reverend horton heat

      i used to wrestle.  i'm pretty sure that i've mentioned that before, mostly because every once in a while it pushes itself to the forefront of my mind, like over the weekend for example.  this past weekend was the ncaa division 1 wrestling championships.  the tournament was in st. louis, so there was really no chance that i'd be there.  in fact the likelihood of me making it to one while living on the west coast is slim, pretty much because amateur wrestling isn't nearly as big here as it is in the midwest and there, comparatively, aren't nearly as many quality college programs here as there are in other parts of the country, so they don't stage the tournament here.  all that is a shame because if there's a single sporting event that i'd choose to go to year in and year out, i think that would be the one.  anyways, i didn't wrestle in college, let alone for a division 1 program, so my interest is relegated mostly to hobby/fan status.  so saturday afternoon/evening, the championship finals were on espn2, and while i was watching them, i got to thinking about that silly six degrees of separation game, and i'm happy to say that in the process, kevin bacon didn't cross my mind a single time.  back to the point, however, i was thinking about how there were several guys wrestling in that tournament who i didn't wrestle myself, but who had wrestled someone that i'd wrestled, who were in my second degree, as it were.    i really don't know why i'm going on about this, maybe it's just a personal inventory sort of thing, or maybe i take some perverse pleasure in telling the world about how this one guy i wrestled in high school slaughtered me on more than one occasion.  see, my connection was specifically through this one guy i wrestled named tom grossman.  this guy was an animal in high school, three time state champion, didn't surrender an offensive point his last two years and ended up getting a scholarship to the university of oklahoma at a time where pretty much nobody recruited texas for wrestlers.  anyways, i wrestled this guy twice, once in the semi-finals at the north texas open, and again in the finals at the grapevine duals.    now imagine yourself a halfway decent wrestler, which i was, rolling along, winning your first couple or three matches to make it into the semifinals or finals of a tournament, making it to that round and subsequently getting your innards handed to you in less than two minutes.  or worse yet, when i wrestled him at grapevine, the tournament was set up in a round-robin format, and i had to win eight matches for the privilege of getting destroyed by him in the finals.  normally, going through all that just to get it handed to me in the finals of a tournament would be a cause for tons of frustration and consternation, but since i knew going in that without the aid of a loaded nine, which i'm not certain would have ensured victory anyway, i was going home with a silver medal, it didn't bother me so much.    so anyway, this guy grossman, for as awesome as he was and as bad as he beat me, didn't make all-american while at oklahoma, which makes me respect all the more what the guys i was watching over the weekend were able to do and understand the level of competition at that tournament, and sorta works to keep me humble.  that silver medal still hangs from my car's rear-view mirror  feeling: old thinking of: my old knee brace music: "monkeys at the zoo" charlie peacock

      i have a neat job.  so thursday is my day off, and it's a good day to have off since wednesdays are usually on the order of anywhere from eleven to thirteen hour days.  i denote it on the blog with lyrics thursday, which will come back next week after taking this week off to commemorate lisa's birthday.  i guess the whole point of mentioning that is to show that there are exceptions, there are always exceptions.  like once a month on thursday i meet with a few peers, guys, and a couple girls, in the same like of work as me, for lunch and even though it's "work" i never mind giving up part of my day off in order to have that.  so anyways, we met this past thursday, a couple days ago, and we were talking about discipleship, which isn't as esoteric as it might first sound.  mostly because even though the word seems to be relegated to this sort of evangelical lexicon, the root word of discipleship is the word discipline.  everybody's a disciple of something, and in as much as people discipline themselves, either consciously or unconsciously, into certain behaviors, they practice discipleship.  "discipleship". . .it may not sound esoteric anymore, but it still sounds heavy handed.  nobody likes discipline, it usually conjures up thoughts of time-outs from when you're a lil kid, or detention or getting grounded when you're in junior high and high school.  move beyond that though, because beyond that there lies a point at which you (hopefully) reach a level of maturity such that you understand the role that discipline plays and that more than being mere punishment, it's a vital component of the search for pleasure.    with that understanding comes the realization that discipline is employed as a means to the end of acheiving something worth the effort put forth.  we're very utilitarian people, generally, and we assign value to things based on what they can get us, which is to say that it's rare that we want to, will, or even can evaluate something on its own merits, without demanding to know its relevance to any number of other things that we perceive to be more important.  now i got where i am on this because here lately i've been reading and listening to a whole lot of john piper whose whole life's work it seems is to get people around him to understand that our pursuit of pleasure and God's pursuit of glory, both of which require discipline on our part, are not at odds, they're not different things so much that they're exactly the same.  he cites c.s. lewis (surprise, surprise) who writes that though we perceive our desires to be too strong, when our attention is called to what we could be desiring, we find that our desires are instead too weak.  he says to imagine being offered infinte and immeasurable joy and pleasure and instead accepting in its place things that are totally mundane, a good job, some nice stuff, sex maybe.  we want what we want, and we want it now, mostly because we don't know any better that what we want right now pales in comparison to what we could get if we could train ourselves to desire those things that are inifinitely greater.  if it sounds like we have to train ourselves to want the really good stuff, i think it's because we do.  feeling: liberated thinking of: wrestling music: "thought menagerie" sixpence

      it's like there's a birthday every other day this month.  well, maybe just today and the day before yesterday.  so there's adam, who to be really honest, when i first met him, i thought was sort of a goofy, maybe a bit of a nerdy guy.  i don't think that it was any vibe that he gave off himself, because he's definitely not nerdy, i think he just reminded me of, looked like another guy i knew who was a bit nerdy.  anyways, i met adam at the beginning of my junior year of college, christian education was one of my majors, it was a major that required completion of a ministry internship in order to  satisfy the requirements for graduation, so it was getting to the point where i'd have to think pretty long and hard about what i would do for it.  actually, that's not true at all in fact.  growing up, in junior high and high school i'd volunteered during the summers working on the rec staff at kids camps back in texas for sid, who's a pretty awesome guy in his own right, so i'd pretty much made up my mind that that'd be what i'd do for my internship;  i'd done it before, it would fulfill my requirement and it would be easy to do again.  so anyways, i was taking to adam one morning after church, after church, i guess i woulda been afternoon by then, and i think we were talking about school or something like that and i mentioned that i had to do an internship for my CE major.  but like i said, my mind was pretty well made up as to where i'd be, and that was most definitely not illinois, so when he proposed that we have lunch that week to talk about the possibility of me doing my internship ther, pretty much the only thing i was excited about was the prospect of scoring a free lunch.  if you know me, or have stalked me for an extended period of time, you know how that ended up, i did end up spending the summer in illinois, interning there, having adam as my supervisor and mentor.  i never expected that i would develop the kind of relationship with him that i did, even with his family.  even though i was the intern and he was the supervisor, he made obvious the fact that he cared not just about what i was doing for him and the church and stuff like that, but he cared about  me , good gravy, he let me live in his house; how i was doing, what was with me, i could always count on him to shoot straight with me, even with stuff that wasn't easy, which is more than can be said for others i've encountered, even in the profession i'm in, but that's another entery for another day, i guess.  all that put more succinctly, there are a handful of people in this world whose influence i can point to and say spending time with that person changed me profoundly.  i learned a lot about how people should relate to each other from adam.  thanks adam.  feeling: grateful thinking of: 2 S 361 Glen Park Rd, Lombard, IL 60148 music: "escher's world" chagall guevara

      a friday five?  here?  there's a first time for everything.  if you. . .  1. . . .owned a restaurant, what kind of food would you serve?  i'd probly open up a lil taco stand, where you can get  real   tacos, you know like carnitas or fajita or lengua or chicharron or something like that, wrapped up in two corn tortillas with limes and fresh salsa.  flour tortillas too, cause they're just good, but no taco would be crunchy, there's no such thing as a crunchy taco.  2. . . .owned a small store, what kind of merchandise would you sell.  books and guns.  yes, books and guns.  3. . . .wrote a book, what genre would it be?  dunno really, i've toyed with writing some short stories, but nothing really serious.  f. scott fitzgerald said that a writer is a person for whom the task of writing is much more difficult than it is for anyone else, if he's right, i feel like i'm a writer maybe two or three days a week.  hold a gun to my head, i'd probly say a sort of expository book that would blend my affinity for theology and social theory, or if i was talented enough a narrative of a fictional character who encounters that kinda stuff.  4. . . .ran a school, what would you teach?  me and bone have talked about this on several occasions, we would take over the vaunted  urlLink st. mark's school of texas  and turn it into a sort of academy where we would design the curriculum to our tastes and teach various forms of hand to hand combat.  we'd get rid of all the sports teams except wrestling.  5. . . .recorded an album, what kind of music would be on it?  i dunno, but if i did an album of celine dion covers, it would the the crappy kind.  not even i can salvage what comes out of her mouth.

      so today is march 18th.  a year ago today i was on a plane to chicago, guess it was sorta my spring break.  i hadn't been there since graduating the may before and there were people i hadn't seen in that ten months or so that i was really looking forward to seeing, so i was pretty stoked.  that was a great week, i did get to at least see everyone i wanted to and reconnected with some awesome people.  so like i said, i went out there on march 18th, which also happens to be my friend lisa's birthday.  now me and lisa go way back, well, not really way  way  back but we got to be pretty good friends starting three years or so ago.  lisa's awesome, we share the indiginty of being taken to a roller skating rink for our respective birthdays as well as a lot of other stuff, mostly slurpees in the yard at wheaton, lots of drives around chicago's vaunted western suburbs, and trips to baker's square either to commiserate over a cruddy week or wrap up an awesome one.  happy birthday lisa, you're the coolest.  feeling: bittersweet thinking of: baker's square music: "the rub of love" chagall guevara

      so the strike is over.  what i'm talking about is the grocery store workers strike that started back in october.  hindsight seems to bring clarity in places where it was lacking previously, since the whole thing started workers lost, i hear, over three hundred million dollars in wages, i don't know the toll it took on the stores, i know business was way down, mostly because with minimal staffing and picketers outside hassling everybody, shopping at union grocery stores was little more than a pain that could be avoided if there was a stater brothers or food-4-less anywhere near.  the other fallout is that i'm not shopping at wal-mart anymore.  the whole reason for the strike was wal-mart's expansion into the grocery business coupled with their non union status which enables them to offer lower wages and fewer benefits and make the grocery companies squeeze their workers to remain competitive.  the workers, wanting to protect themselves, strike when the upcoming bargaining agreement proposes to cut their benefits.  that i didn't have a problem with, but i did get rubbed the wrong way when i went to albertson's early in the strike to get something i wasn't able to find anywhere else and a picketer asked me not to shop there until the strike was over.  that i understood, but it's sort of ridiculous to ask people to not shop where you work and then to come back when you want them to, i mean you're actively driving business away from the company that employs you.  i went grocery shopping last night, which is the first time i've had to do that since the strike ended at the beginning of the month, and upon reflection, i decided not to go to albertson's, which is where i went before the strike and to instead go to food-4-less, which is where i went during the strike.  i'm not entirely sure why i chose to do that, i think it's the slight segment of my personality that's vindictive, i mean if the stores and workers could hold out on each other and the general public for five months, i figure they deserve at least that much from me.  feeling: a cut on my fist thinking of: completion music: "rigged on a fix" rancid

      i watch wrestling.  i used to anyway, i guess i still do, but certainly more sporadically than i have in the past.  watching it seemed to be a pretty big part of my experience growing up, and i'm still not sure what drew me to it initially, i guess it was something exclusive to the Y chromosome, some sort of acceptable outlet for aggression or maybe a source a bit off the beaten path for a young boy's heroes, who knows for sure?  anyways, growing up i'd go to my grandparents' house on monday nites to eat dinner and watch wrestling, and when he was *ahem* hooked up, i'd go over there to watch the pay-per-views.  so today is wrestlemania, which is sort of the centerpiece of the wrestling calendar, i think the last one i saw was fourteen, the main event in that one was stone cold steve austin vs. the heartbreak kid shawn michaels, austin won and became the champion for the first time.  i taped it and one time me and agnich ditched class on a friday afternoon, i bought us lunch at gazeebo using petty cash from the student council cash box and we went to his house and watched it.  today's wrestlemania is number twenty, and they use roman numerals like the super bowl, so i guess the last one i saw was really XIV and today's is XX.  agnich thanked me for lunch and i said don't thank me, thank the st. mark's student council.  feeling: like a little boy thinking of: the sportatorium music: "carnival of carnage" insane clown posse

      i have parents.  two of them in fact, i remember when i was in middle school, my level of maturity was such that people would get shocked looks on their faces when they found out that i had parents.  well i'd like to think it was my level of maturity, it could have been that they believed i was some sort of hellspawn with neither the hope nor the possibility of any connection to natural processes of life.  so i'm 23, and they're young too, in fact, when my dad was my age, i was three, and when my mom was my age, i was five.  anyone who knows me realizes the total frivolity of the idea of me being married, let alone with any sort of extra-generational interest.  in any case, that would put my parents in their early 40s, and in fact the reason i'm writing about them is that today is, in fact, my mom's birthday.  one of the neater things about growing up has been being able to see the relationship between my parents and me evolve.  knowing that's not the case for everyone, i feel pretty blessed that there's nothing really contentious there, and more blessed when i realize that they've contributed more to who i am than i'm really aware.  happy birthday mom! :-)  feeling: pretty good thinking of: woof music: "faith my eyes" caedmon's call

      i joined bally's  this happened about a month ago and it's something i thought i'd never do, i mean i'd see their commercials which would pretty much solidify in my mind every good reason i had not to join.  on top of the meat-market vibe they gave off, any company that uses justin timberlake, jessica simpson, kylie minogue, and ace of base (?!?) to advertise themselves is no company that deserves my business.  so anyway, i'd been running since last august, like two miles, if not every day, then at least four or five times a week, but once december rolled around, i got out of the habit.  once that happened it seemed to start a bit of a domino effect because when discipline in one area of my life falls by the wayside, the door swings wide open to letting the same thing happen in others.  so then sometime in january, i noticed that my energy level was really low, like get up, go to work, come home, do nothing, kinda low.  that's pretty much where i was, more or less just tired of walking around worn out all the time.  i got sick twice in january, sinus infection or the lightweight flu, something like that, which i'm pretty sure i was more susceptible to because of the whole diminished energy thing.  so like i said i started a month or so ago, the first week of february and since then i've noticed that i've definitely been better off for it.  good gravy, ace of base?  they were dumb by seventh grade.  feeling: pressured thinking of: the word "perfunctory" music: "counting the cost" charlie peacock

      so today is march 8th.  winter's not even over, not officially anyway, so imagine my surprise when the temperature climbed into the 90s today.  the temp didn't bother me so much, in fact, i didn't even really think it was that hot simply because all the natives were going on about how hot it was and i know what wusses they are when it comes to weather, normally when the temperature climbs over 80 it's cause to talk about how hot it is and ponder moving to cooler climes.  in any case, it was kinda nice to get a shot of the summer so early, and it's the kind of thing that brought back a sort of applied memory, a few of them in fact.  like that summer in college when i worked for 7-11 and had lunch outside in the courtyard every day until it became absolutely unbearable, which ended up being about 103.  there was that and the time my brother and i were driving around on a sunday afternoon that was over a hundred degrees and the car started to overheat, so we had to turn the heater on, which is remarkably similar to the time i was with him and we had a tire that happened to go flat on the freeway on the way home.  as if that wasn't enough, when i was changing the tire, one of the bolts broke.  i don't seem to have the best of luck on hot days, makes me wonder why i'm such a fan.  feeling: conflicted thinking of: luck music: "it's not the heat, it's the humanity" bouncing souls

      i live in southern california.  and i have some really cool friends, but i'll get to that in a bit, i think.  so anyways, it was about a year and a half ago that i moved out here after spending four years going back and forth between chicago and dallas, school and home.  the cool thing about being in those two places is that it wasn't at all difficult to make it to one place or the other if i had a long weekend or something like that.  since pretty much all my friends were either in the one place or the other, i never went too terribly long without seeing friends that weren't where i was.  living out here is a bit different.  make no mistake, i love where i live, i got a great job, the people here are as nice as anywhere and i'll never complain about the weather, but geographically (not topographically, there's a difference) this place is in about the worst possible location.  head west and you can't go very far before you wind up in the ocean, which is pretty to look at, no doubt, but it's an ocean, and there's really not anywhere to go there, well not anywhere for me to go there anyway.  head east, good gravy, have you ever headed east of here?  there's nothing until you get to phoenix, and i still have yet to figure out what its excuse for existance is or who the joke is on.  basically what i'm saying is that long beach being where it is, is pretty geographically isolated and limits the opportunities i get to see old friends, the ones that live in other places.  now instead of getting in the car and road tripping for a long weekend, i gotta take vacation days and buy plane tickets to do it, complications that are pretty mitigating.  so when i get the kinda news that i got today, where i hear that one of my friends is coming out here, well it's the kinda thing that makes you not mind being surrounded by ocean and desert so much.  annie's coming out at the end of this month from chicago, in less than three weeks actually, i could write tons about her, i've already written a   urlLink bit  , but i'll just say the list she's on is very short.  i haven't seen her in a year, so it definitely feels like a long time coming.  it does mean i gotta clean my place up tho.  feeling: stoked thinking of: blowing up the desert, but that's been tried i think music: "tonight tonight" smashing pumpkins

      i'm not much for labels.  that's not always been the case, and it seems as though, for the majority of the population, it's not presently the case either.  it seems as though everywhere you go there are people who really want you to know, who won't hesitate to tell you exactly who they percieve themselves to be.    personally, i've never figured that out, like when people define themselves as either conservative or liberal and the biggest insult they can levy at someone else is to call them a conservative or a liberal, whichever one they themselves don't happen to be.  that sort of identification process is definitely not confined to that pair of "ideal" types, however, because anytime people start to define and label themselves ideologically, they do the same thing.    what i've never understood is the air of moral superiority that seems to inevitably show up with that kind of identification, as though there was some sort of virtue that came from simply being conservative, or liberal, or a feminist, or a communist, or a white supremacist, whatever.  the troublesome thing is that methods of identification that aren't even inherently dependent on ideology become dependent, well maybe not dependent, but they develop an ideology of their own.    a nickel to anyone who can think of an example.  feeling: in need of a deep breath thinking of: socks music: "days like this" van morrison

      today is texas independence day.  i guess it's time for a bit of a history lesson, because if you didn't grow up in the greatest country in the world, then you didn't take texas history in fourth grade and seventh grade and likely have no idea about how God's greatest creation came to be.  so anyways, on march 2, 1836 at washington-on-the-brazos, the texas declaration of independence was adopted.  the subsequent fight for independence attracted people from all over who wanted to lend aid.  davy crockett came from tennessee, and after being defeated in a run for congress there told his constituents "you can all go to hell, i'm going to texas."  independence wasn't actually won until a month and a half later or so, on april 21st at the battle of san jacinto, in which texans showed they could be as sneaky as mexicans and attacked during their afternoon nap.  the legend goes that they attacked while the mexican general santa anna was laying down eating chicken and stole his wooden leg, which eventually ended up in a museum in illinois.  you can learn a lot watching king of the hill.  feeling: texan thinking of: texas music: "God blessed Texas" little texas

      when i was little, i was terrified of thunderstorms.  that's not a very useful fear when you grow up in texas, where thunderstorms can occur at the drop of a hat.  severe thunderstorms.  violent thunderstorms.  the kind that, at the age of eight, make you ponder your existance and the very real (to you) possibility that your house will be struck by lightning and you'll burn to a crisp inside, you and your cabbage patch kid who you're sure is every bit as scared as you are.  eventually, i got over my fear, so much so that now i really enjoy a good thunderstorm, even if i don't happen to be inside for it.  the first time it rained after i moved out here happened to coincide with the first time i'd locked my keys in the car in about three or four years and i didn't mind that much, having to stand outside and wait for the locksmith.  so it's been raining here the past few days, and when it rains here, the showers aren't usually accompanied by any thunder and lightning or anything like that, which is just as well, at least for the "anything like that" case, because that stuff is usually hail or tornadoes or something like that and who really needs that?  that donald o'connor, he was a genius.  feeling: shortchanged thinking of: laura music: "saved by love" amy grant

      so i got lost.  you'll notice, or maybe you won't, i won't presume to tell you what to do, that entries have been sparse here pretty much all month, not even sparse so much as non-existent.  so anyways, there's no triumphant return, just this, a bit of frustration at my lack of discipline.  i did write a few things while i was "gone," i don't like any of them that much, so i'll probly end up only posting two or three of them, one about baseball, one about being brown, and maybe one about the reaction to krispy kreme's decision to do away with the free donut policy,  all back-dated of course, as is my way.  it's funny, when i made it, i had no idea that the last entry i made, the lyrics from "welcome to struggleville," would end up seeming pretty appropriate for the last few weeks, not that anything's been a terrible struggle or anything like that, more busy-ness than anything else and the most frustrating thing about it, at least with the blog was that those are/were the kinda times for which i specifically created this thing.  maybe a little bit more specifically, there was other stuff that was frustrating too, and i figure i used some of that as somewhat of an excuse to not write but it's the kind of stuff i think i would have benefitted from writing about.  i'm torn about that mostly because i've had some of my most insightful conversations with different people in the last month or so, and my memory being what it is, i like being able to simply remember those conversations.  anyways, i'm rambling, so now you  know  that i'm back.  feeling: familiar thinking of: integrity music: "one headlight" wallflowers

      i'm a brown person.  that's overly simplistic i know, but i figure it's just easier to say that than it is to say latino or hispanic or mexican or something like that and have the pc police get all pissy or something like that.  on top of that, it doesn't seem to be terribly relevant to much of anything.  gimme a minute, cause i'll make the connection.  anyways, i've been getting these emails in my inbox, maybe you've gotten them too, they're the ones that show a name that you know in the sender field and have an offer for free movie tickets.  it's usually indicated in the subject line with a phrase something like "hey go here and we'll get free movie tickets!"  and then if you don't go there, i dunno where, i never went, i'll get into that in a minute i guess, then you get subsequent emails with subject lines like "last chance for free movie tickets!" or the less conspicuous "invitation," ostensibly to get you to go there and get free movie tickets.    so like i said, i never end up going, though a couple of times i'd open the email, even though i knew i possessed no designs on clicking the link inside.  the whole thing reminded me of a george lopez bit where he'd talk about mexican people being distrustful of anything like a sweepstakes or an offer for free stuff, the fear was that anything like that was a front for the INS to get your name and address and stuff and ship you back across the border like they did with cheech.  on the other hand, i could be missing out on a chance to teach some asian guys to be cholos.  feeling: suspicious thinking of: escape music: "born in east L.A." cheech

      spring starts today.  technically it started a couple weeks or so ago.  you'd never know it by the weather here, which seems to be the customary way people distinguish between seasons, but this is california and what i tell people when they ask about the weather is that there are two seasons here: the one where the high is sixty and the one where the low is sixty.  that's not the case everywhere though, i remember when i lived in illinois, snow would be on the ground well into april, which is to say well into the spring, when it's really s'posed to be more of a winter thing.  so other than the weather, and in the absence of the calendar of course, the only real surefire way to tell if it's spring is whenever baseball season starts.  it's funny, i don't even think i like baseball that much, i'm not a die hard by any stretch, like if someone was to ask me "hey do you like baseball?"  i'd likely say something along the lines of "i guess, it's ok."  i wrote about my affinity for the rangers, and since i live out of the area, they come on tv infrequently enough, usually only when they play the angels, that i'll usually make a point to watch the whole game whenever they're on.  beyond that, i'm not sure what the appeal is and why it seems to be such a landmark.  maybe it's just that, it's a landmark, like one of those things that provides a familiar sort of comfort.  it's like the feeling i'd get when i'd cross from arkansas into texas on a drive home from wheaton, one of those things that just sorta tells you that the universe is working the way it's supposed to, which is exactly the kind of feeling whose significance can never be underestimated.  feeling: content thinking of: being seven years old music: "found out about you" gin blossoms

      this was a better world when. . .  i hear that from some oldsters once in a while, the statement is usually accompanied by a pretty high level of crustiness, crochetiness, and generally a pretty significant sense of good-old-days syndrome.  people that know me know that i'm a pretty big fan of the crusty old guy, seeing as a large part of the wisdom i've obtained in life has come from the same.  however, i have to say that they're wrong about this one.  i grew up in and inhabit a much different world than these guys did in their youth, there isn't any doubt about that, not in the least.  today's memorial day and i'm sitting here, at the age of twenty three, without ever having had to consider a stint, of any length, of military service either involuntary or voluntary.  i mean there are times i've thought and sometimes still do about getting commissioned and joining some branch, that usually comes and goes in a matter of moments, however.  back quite a few years, it was nearly customary for a young man to have spent at least some amount of time in military service, a scant few had the option of sort of flippantly considering it only to decide "meh, that's not really for me".  i'm certain that a large part of the reason why that's not the case anymore, that i can ponder such a thing so fleetingly is because people who are significantly older than me couldn't or didn't.  please don't misunderstand me, this isn't about war, being for it or against it, or being a pacifist or not, a dove or a hawk, whatever.  what i'm saying is that the freedom we have to thank those who've served for goes beyond eagles and flags and fireworks and BBQs and ultimately silly stuff like that, it even goes beyond all the stuff we associate with freedom; speech, religion, assembly, guns, sex, the fact that we're able to spend so much time arguing about such stupid stuff is a credit to the courage those crusty old guys showed back when.  we fancy ourselves as significantly more sophisticated in contemporary times than we imagine that they were decades ago, and almost certainly we equate that with the idea that we, ourselves, are objectively better than they.  this wasn't a better world when, it's a better world now, because of them.  we would all do well to find someone responsible and thank him.  feeling: grateful thinking of: crusty old guys music: "heroes of our past" dropkick murphys

      there was always tuesday to look forward to.  now beyond saying that it's really silly to look forward to a particular day of the week primarly because of a tv show, i won't make a value judgement on doing so, mostly because i'd be incriminating myself in any further pejoritave statement i might make.  i won't be too harsh on myself, because i mean it wasn't like i was waiting around for "friends" or "seinfeld" or some other show adored by legions of estrogen-addled nitwits and knuckleheaded simpletons, respectively.  so anyway, i've watched every single episode of 24 since it started three years ago.  there was a close call with the finale of the first season, it was before i moved out here, back when i lived in texas, or was spending the summer there anyway; i was actually interviewing for the job that brought me out here on the day that that episode aired, and being at the mercy of others as far as my schedule and activities went, watching it live wasn't really an option.  luckily, my dad remembered to tape it for me and saved the day.  suffice it to say i'm a huge fan of the show, not so much that i'm a total dork for it like those people who watch star trek or whatever and notice all the lil details that aren't perfect.    what's funny though, is that i wasn't really *really* stoked about the show back when it first started, and had circumstances been a bit different, i'm not certain i would have gotten into the show at all.  i remember my roommate back then, wes, was so excited mostly because i think he had a man-crush on kiefer sutherland.  whatever you might think of the show, it really has been a great vehicle for sutherland, before it i never really liked him or disliked him, now i think he's a total hardass.  at this point, i might have a man-crush of my own on kiefer, i'm almost certain that i have one on jack bauer.  so now season three is over, and like i said i won't have it to look forward to, which is sort of a pity considering tuesday, being sort of a mundane day, was a great day to have something like that to look forward to.  now fox will probly put on some insipid reality show with half-naked imbiciles whose lack of clothing is exceeded only by their lack of sense.    the only thing that could possibly make this right is another dose of paris and nicole.  feeling: superficially empty, if that's possible thinking of: sunglasses music: "alcohol drip" sorta

      i grew up in dallas.  i see myself going back one day, maybe soon, and when i say soon, i mean in a matter of years, not imminently, but that's neither here nor there, at least not right this second it's not.  i've noticed that i keep up with local happenings there a way more closely than i do out here in long beach, sometimes i wonder if that's any indication of a slack commitment to my citizenship out here as a californian or whatever, or maybe if it's representative of some sort of a deep and real desire to be there.  i dunno because i think it took me at least a couple years before i really took ownership of being in the chicago area, at least to the point where i followed local events with the same vigilance as i did ones in dallas.  so the big deal, what's dominating local dialogue, at least from my detached and limited perspective, is the proposal put forward to move the cowboys back inside the city limits.  they left, went to irving, around three decades ago, and kept the name "dallas" cowboys, this despite not having really been in dallas in all that time.  their departure was actually a pretty prescient move on their part, the area of town their stadium was in, was seeing some early indicators of a decline that's turned out to be pretty precipitous and nearly total.  so, like i said, they high-tailed it to irving, where they had a stadium waiting for them, a stadium which, for its day, was state of the art.  in fact, it's the only thing irving is known for, other than the stadium is the fact that you pretty much have to drive through it to get to the airport, if it wasn't for those two things, i'd be pretty sure that it's existence was mere rumor.  but now, texas stadium, state of the art thirty years ago, is antiquated and in disrepair, at least that's the party line from the team, which basically means that instead of making totally obscene amounts of money, they're only making ridiculously obscene amounts of money.  that being the case, they're scouting locations for a brand new stadium that could net them the aforementioned totally obscene amounts of money, with the focus being on fair park, the very same area they left back in the seventies, in particular.  right now, the big point of contention, like it always is whenever a sports franchise wants a stadium, is how much they want to be subsidized by local governments.  at this point, the cowboys want $425 million of a $650 million tab from dallas county taxpayers.  this is the part where i tell you that according to forbes magazine, the cowboys made a profit of nearly sixty million dollars just  last year  and that their owner jerry jones' net worth is in the hundreds of millions of dollars and let you draw your own conclusions.  if that wasn't enough this is where i tell you that they want all that money  and  all the subsidiary rights to any and all intellectual property, marketing and economic benefits from all the revenue streams.  the ones generated by the taxpayers' $425 million.  feeling: apathetic thinking of: all the drives back and forth on airport freeway music: "i wanna race bigfoot trucks" mojo nixon

       second of two   this was a better world when structure was structure and not express men.  i needed jeans, the "nice" ones i got are showing early signs of wear, and i figured i'd rather wear them a bit less frequently and have them in good shape for a while longer than keep wear them out quicker than i feel like i need to.  anyway, i head to los cerritos center, mostly because they have a structure. . .er an express men (expressmen?), which is where i get my jeans.  that place had always done right by me, i'd been getting my jeans there since high school, some of which i still wear.  they had good jeans, comfortable ones and they were cheap, which is to say inexpensive.  i could usually get a pair that would last a while from there for around thirty bucks.  so i get to structure and start looking at jeans, and i was tempted to go outside and look at the sign to make sure i was in the right place, this despite the fact that i was well aware of the fact that the sign would say "express men" and not "structure," so i dunno where that thought came from.  wait, yes i do, the jeans there sucked, i'm not sure they could have sucked any more if they had actually grown lips for the purpose.  they were awful, they didn't look anything like the one's i'd gotten from there in the past, and on top of that there wasn't a pair cheaper than fifty bucks.  i needed a moment, or a few, i mean i was pretty disgusted by the whole "expressmen" imbroglio, and there was also the business of getting a new blazer, sportcoat, whatever, so i went to robinsons-may, where, evidently, extravaganza season was ongoing, because everything was marked down like 40%.  now, i'm a 44S, as far as jackets go, which isn't always the easiest to find and i wasn't really finding anything all that impressive, at least not as far as coats went.  what i did find was they had calvin klein suit separates in my size.  you know how it is, it's more money than you planned spending or even than you want to spend, but in the back of your mind, you also know that you're not gonna find a deal like that for a while to come, so if there's a time to take advantage, it's right then, so i ended up getting a suit, the nearly three hundred bucks was most definitely more than i'd planned on spending that day, but considering the thing'd been marked down from over $450, i didn't feel too too bad.  anyways, for jeans, i'm down with anchor blue, for now   feeling: addicted thinking of: dunno, nothing good probly music: "i walk the line" johnny cash

       first of two   i've been a fiend here lately.  that's as far as shopping goes.  i'm definitely not one who could be defined as a fashion-hound, if that's even a term in anyone's vernacular.  so anyways, i don't go shopping that often, at least not for myself, usually whenever i make it to the mall, it's to get stuff for other people like whenever i put together that package for laura on her birthday, or when i do go for myself, i'm usually looking for something like a book or a cd or maybe like the bag i got a couple months ago.  it's not like i'm clueless though, i do have an idea about how to shop, enough of one to where i don't look like a total fool.  i guess i owe that to a certain ex-girlfriend whose favorite pastime was going to the mall, i guess when they're in high school tho, that's pretty much true of nearly any individual with two x chromosomes.  one day i'll tell the  other  story that centers around that particular ex-girlfriend, it's really juicy.  anyways, lately i've found myself with a compulsion to go shopping, it started off pretty innocently, the day before easter, i just wanted to get a new shirt and maybe a tie, you know easter and whatnot, so i headed off to robinsons-may to take care of that, but i stumble into the middle of some sort of reduced price extravaganza, otherwise known as a sale, where i find dockers (and i sorely needed slacks) at half price, so i got three pair, i get a couple shirts, but not dress shirts, which along with the tie, i'd completely forgotten about.  so i go back later to get that stuff.  all told, i'd come home with three pair of dockers, four shirts, and a tie for slightly over $200.  i felt like a crook.  that wasn't even the end of it though.  feeling: somehow cosmopolitan, and as such odd thinking of: shoes music: "the lament of desmond r.g. underwood IV" steve taylor

      i have parents.  i might have mentioned that before, in fact, i'm fairly certain that i have.  in fact, i think that mention came on my mom's birthday back in march, that i'm making mention of it again makes sense, mostly because today is my dad's birthday.  he was born on this day in 1960, which would make him 44 today, which in turn makes him really young to have a kid that's around my age.  that didn't necessarily work to my advantage when i was but a tyke, as i recall him being quite a conservative individual, the list of tv shows i wasn't allowed to watch and movies i wasn't allowed to see was pretty lengthy.  that's not to say that he actively deprived me of any good thing, though it took me a while to realize that, but ain't that always the case.  we've always gotten along pretty well, i mean when i was in middle and high school there were hiccups, a handful of times we'd find ourselves at loggerheads, but those were fairly few and far between, which i s'pose is a credit to both of us.  so anyways, whenever me and him were in the same state, we'd get to soccer games, watch boxing, get tacos, stuff like that, stuff that was always fun.  now when i want a torta or something like that or to watch a soccer game, more often than not i gotta do it on my own.  he did get to come out here last year around thanksgiving and i saw him a lil over a month after that when i went home for christmas.  happy birthday dad, you're a cool guy.  feeling: alright thinking of: dad music: "seein my father in me" paul overstreet

      happy cinco de mayo.  that's today.  cinco de mayo.  there are a couple of misconceptions about cinco de mayo, at least with regard to what exactly it is.  first, it's not simply the day the bars decided to make corona longnecks a nickel all day, although that makes it a better day than it would be otherwise.  it's also not mexican independence day.  that particular day is  urlLink september 16, 1810 .  cinco de mayo commemorates an event a little over fifty years later.  what had happened was mexico had gotten itself into dutch, not with the dutch, but with the english, the spanish and the french.  so those three nations decided to send armies to mexico, ostensibly as a sort of collection agency for the money they were owed by mexico.  benito juarez, mexico's president, quickly made an agreement with the governments of england and spain.  france's leader, napoleon, however, had designs on mexico and wasn't as easily convinced to bring his army back home, so he sent 6,500 troops who were met by a smaller, less well-equipped mexican force at puebla led by general ignacio zaragoza and aided by among other things, hostile terrain, a cattle stampede started by the citizens of puebla, and just some good old mexican stubbornness, who routed them.  that happened on may 5, 1862.  and that's how the mexican st. patrick's day came to be.  feeling: like i want a corona and some doritos thinking of: the beach music: "loco gringos like a party" reverend horton heat

      donuts are good.  they  taste  good, unfortunately, they're up there with peanut butter and maybe lard as ounce for ounce one of the worst things you can put in your body.  i guess sprinkling some blow on some gorditas like that one time javi did it would be worse, but that's neither here nor there i don't guess.  no doubt you've heard of krispy kreme donuts, good donuts to be sure, but where they excel is on amazing PR, most of the mom and pop donut shops that the korean families owned and operated in oak cliff have way better donuts.  so about a week and a half ago i saw this article in both the fort worth and dallas papers about how the local krispy kremes were doing away with their policy of giving away a free sample to pretty much everybody who darkened the doors of the place.  so you know how people are, take away their free stuff and they get pissed, nevermind the fact that they weren't losing anything.  the lady in the star-telegram article was quoted as saying that the change in policy had made her mad.  now apart from the truth expressed in the first sentence of this paragraph, that sort of reaction makes somewhere between zero and little sense to me.  i mean they're krispy kreme's donuts and what they choose to do with them is entirely up to them.  on top of that, if you're going to krispy kreme, odds are you're leaving with donuts whether they give you a free one or not.  so you don't get a free one, maybe that's the kind of thing that warrants an "aw, nuts" and maybe a very slight wave of temporary disappointment, but not for this lady i don't guess, she was mad.   unfortunately for her, they also showed a picture of her in the article.  feeling: patient thinking of: what to wear music: "no me se rajar" vicente fernandez

      that pt barnum was on to something.  i remember when i was in middle school about twelve or thirteen, i knew this guy his name was brandon, who was quite a bit older, five or six years.  usually people that age have very little use for people in middle school, brandon wasn't really all that different that's not to say he wasn't a good or even a nice guy, he was definitely that, because i guess people of any age have very little use for people in middle school.  anyways, i guess that i was seen by him as sort an exception to that rule because we became friends, pretty good friends too, in a lot of ways, he was the first person who i can say was ever a mentor to me.  well you know how it is, when you're that age and you've got a friend who's that much older, you tend to pick things up from them, and the thing that sticks out that i picked up from brandon was music.  now beyond the fact that he introduced me to both U2 and steve taylor, those particular artists have very little in common.  i mean you'd have to have been hiding under a rock to not be at least slightly familiar with U2 and you'd have to have been looking underneath some rocks to have heard of steve taylor, so consider today a bit of an education.  sometime in the early 80s, taylor wrote a song called "am i in sync?" which cited as inspiration a woody allen quote saying "i don't want to acheive immortality through my work, i want to acheive it through not dying."  what the song gets into is the idea of people willingly (on some level) looking foolish in order to ensure some sense recognition by a greater than average number of people or rememberance for a greater than average number of days, weeks, months or years.  you had to have known this wouldn't simply be about a song, and that the reference to pt barnum wouldn't be there for nothing, he's the one who told us that there's a sucker born every minute, but i'll get to that in a minute.  one of the features of pop culture these days, twenty years or so after steve taylor wrote his song, is the reality television show, in which people willingly (on some level) look foolish in order to ensure some sense of recognition by a greater than average number of people and rememberance for a greater than average number of days, weeks, months or years.  so there's this show, it's called american idol, i bet you've heard of it.  you know how it goes, what ensues is the willing public humiliation of a great many (nearly without exception unwitting) people in exchange for a sniff of fame.  they're not the only suckers though, we're all suckers, even me.  maybe we don't end up assaulting any judges eardrums necessarily, but while we're at the same time disgusted by the whole thing and not so inadvertently amused by the humiliated,  the producers back a dumptruck full of money up to the bank vault and fill it full of the advertising dollars we make available to them.    and that's not even the worst part because i saw an article the other day that said that producers are set to put together a "christian" version of the show, obviously it won't be called "christian idol" or anything like that, idolatry being a pretty severe violation of commandment number two and all.  now there's a lot that i could say, mostly about the sort of subculture that christianity promotes for itself seeming largely incapable of coming up with an original idea and subsequently piggybacking on any idea someone else has that makes a halfway decent amount of money, but i'll save that for another day.  so the show won't have idol in the name, instead it'll be called "gifted," the obvious connotation being that the finalists received their ability to sing from the Almighty, those weeded out in preliminary rounds having recieved them ostensibly from satan, who knows, really, i could be wrong about that.    i don't suspect that the program will want for contestants, i hope that i'm wrong about that and that a dearth of willing participants will make the "idea" people realize just how silly this whole thing is.  but in the end it seems as though that pretty much no group of people is exempt from the desire for quick fame, and there are a couple things that seem noteworthy.  that there isn't a significant difference between those in secular and religious circles with regard to the desire for fame.  the difference is that "gifted" will be ostensibly about using one's gifts for the benefit of God's kingdom.  i don't suspect that will be the case as much as we'll see people who want to be famous for Jesus.  the other thing that seems pretty interesting to me this is the first "christian" attempt at a reality show and that it's an adaptation of the one that has the glossiest finish, the least amount of rough edges and most stresses perfection, i don't think is at all a coincidence.  i'm wondering if a tv show has to do the same things people do to become christian.  feeling: like a sucker thinking of: getting on "gifted" i'm quite talented, really. music: "am i in sync?" steve taylor

       third of three   so we're very stubborn and simple people.  i suspect many will disagree with me, but it's not the government's job, especially in a secular entity such as a democratic republic, that is to say a non-theocratic nation, to acknowledge God in its rhetoric or its symbols.  is it a nice thought?  for many it certainly is, and one that provides a great deal of comfort.  both the level and the type of comfort that come with this issue, however, are potentially dangerous to anyone who has a desire to cultivate a faith that is alive on a level deeper than the surface.    people are so worried about God being acknowledged by the government or being a part of the pledge of allegiance, or whatever, nearly seeming to take personal offense when that acknowledgement is threatened, it's sort of ridiculous.  i bet that nobody even asked God if he wanted to be in our silly pledge, not because he wouldn't want to be glorfied, but because he wouldn't want to be co-opted into something that is far less than what he is.  don't get me wrong, i love our country and i love God, but what bugs me is that when we tie God up with every hokey lil patriotic sign or banner, we elevate america to a level equal with God or we diminish God to a level equal with our country, idolatry on one hand and blasphemy on the other, not so warm and fuzzy anymore, is it?    when people's fights for faith are over stuff like this that is because of the context, in the final analysis, trivial, the strength of witness is weakened, not strengthened.  one thing tony campolo says from time to time is that america is babylon, it's the best babylon, but it's babylon nevertheless, and that when our focus is on babylon, it is necessarily not on God's kingdom.  i suspect God wouldn't care if he was acknowledged by any nation in its rhetoric and symbols if those of us inhabiting that nation who purported to represent him did a better job acknowledging him with the way we lived.  there, i'm finished.  feeling: marginalized thinking of: the scourge of real simplicity music: "americanism" MxPx

       second of three   so where was i?  oooh yah, the pledge of allegiance.  well you know how it is, one good turn deserves another, and so the ruling fills the folks on the other side full of piss and vinegar, which is to say that they're offended.  they say things like the ruling is another step in a process that will deprive the faithful and devout of their freedoms, and that bad things are in store for the country because of yet another refusal on the part of the government to recognize the Almighty, or in any case a concept thereof.  so naturally, they decide to fight it tooth and nail.  all the way to the u.s. supreme court the case goes where it's thrown out on a technicality, as the court ruled that the guy who brought the case to the 9th circuit court didn't have the standing to press the case on his daughter's behalf.  so "under God" gets to stay which, one might imagine, would have satisfied those conservative types of the mind of defending this sort of innocuous civil religion.  if one was imagining that, one might most definitely have been mistaken, because really it just seemed to piss them off, mostly because they didn't feel that it went far enough.  they felt as though the case should have been judged by its merits and they wanted the supreme court to say definitively and unequvocally that the idea of taking "under God" out of the pledge of allegiance was without merit.  the sentiment was that the supreme court had a chance to significantly reinforce, well i'm not actually at all sure what they wanted to reinforce beyond a sort of rubber stamp sanction of certain symbols that give people warm fuzzy feelings.    i say that mostly because when the judicial system has in the past ruled in favor of keeping those kinda phrases on national symbols the reason given in the majority opinions has been that those kind of phrases are nothing substantial when it comes to anything religious.  don't tell that to any of the "under God" hawks though.  to hear them tell it every time a tacit acknowledgement to God is taken from the repertoire of national symbols we're just spiraling further and further away from him, relentlessly sliding down the slippery slope of humanism, and relativism and any other bad -ism one would care to name or make up.  and people have very active imaginations.  feeling: like watching cartoons thinking of: mexico music: "took out the trash and i'm never coming back" mojo nixon

       first of three   trying to offend some people is like trying to make them breathe.  i came across this thought a couple years ago when i first read the redneck manifesto by  urlLink jim goad .  the context of that line was a chapter about political correctness and the white liberals who held so tightly to ideals of sensitivity and tolerance and the like.  the idea was that nobody had to try at all to do something that would outrage such people, that there was so much in the world that, in their view, was terrible and unaccepctable they simply woke up every morning offended and outraged.  so our friend goad was definitely right about the liberals, especially since, beyond the fantasy many of them harbor of belonging to some oppressed group of people, they don't really have any reason to be so pissed off.  it would almost seem as though among white liberals, there is an inverse relationship between actual level of oppression to level of affluence, but that i s'pose is fodder for another entry on another day.  what he didn't address, at least not right then, was the level of whininess of those on the "opposite" end of our culture's perceived ideological continuum.  now there's no doubt that the conservatives at least have a better reason than the liberals to be irritated.  the stuff they're upset about is stuff that's of at least  some  level of personal concern, stuff like what their kids see on tv and learn at school, stuff reasonable parents should care about anyhow, but then you see how some folks react to the supreme court's decision regarding the challenge of the pledge of allegiance.  you're likely familiar with at least the gist of the story, a california atheist hears that his daughter's class at school daily recites the pledge of allegiance and subequently decides that this means that atheists are a threatened minority and that he'd better sue to get the words "under God" removed from it, ostensibly for the benefit of his daughter (of whom his wife, not he, has exclusive custody, a detail that would later prove significant), but more likely to project himself as a member of a victimized minority group, because face it how many victimized minority groups do white guys with medical and law degrees get to be a part of?  the man presses his case, wins in the 9th circuit, a bench most sympathetic to his plight, and "under God" is removed from the pledge in all schools under that court's jurisdiction.  what we find is that regardless of how ideologically divergent people claim to be, they're really not all that different.  feeling: duped thinking of: my younger days music: "study humans" MxPx

      born in east LA is a funny movie.  there's one scene in that movie in which INS agents are rounding up some darker hued types suspected of taking up residence in sunny southern california illegally to send back (ostensibly) across the border.  in the hubbub they get cheech, i think his character's name in the movie is rudy, who's phenotypically similar, but speaks perfect english, saying all the time that he was born in east LA.  the INS agent, of course, doesn't believe him and asks him who the president of the united states in order to corroborate his assertion.  cheech, rightful, though ignorant citizen he is, says something to the effect "uh, that actor, he used to be in 'death valley days', uh john wayne!" which seals his fate as he ends up getting deported.  i suspect there are countless *ahem* phenotypically unsuspect people who either don't know who the president is or couldn't identify a picture of him, but that's neither here nor there.  in any case, the answer cheech gave was wrong, not because it wasn't a hollywood actor who'd been in some B-level westerns, it was, it just wasn't john wayne.  the guy i'm sure cheech meant to identify was ronald reagan who, i'm told recently died.  i don't remember much about reagan as president, he was first elected the year i was born, 1980, so i really wasn't at all in the mode of thinking politically for any of the period of time during which he was the president, i was all of eight when his second term ended.  so like i said, i don't remember much of him.  i do remember that my mom absolutely adored him or seemed to anyway, but then she adored jimmy swaggart and wanted me to go to his bible college and we all know what happened with him.  his death seemed to affect quite a large number of people, as he came across as the sort of man who incited a high level of affection one way or another, having so slight a recollection of him as president i didn't really feel affected all that much.  although over the weekend while i was watching some of his funeral proceedings i noticed his epitaph and really appreciated the words that were on it.  it read:  i know in my heart that man is good  that what is good will always and eventually triumph  and that there is purpose and worth in each and every life.   getting down on people is exceedingly easy in a world where you have constantly to deal with them, see how cynical i am?  and i wasn't even trying right then.  i know that he wasn't as heroic as his devotees believe him to have been, and that he wasn't as evil as his detractors suspect he was, but that quote conveys the optimism and faith in people that characterized him and that i think so many people admired about him.  well, they either admired that or the fact that he got rid of the commies.  feeling: encouraged thinking of: the first point of calvinism, the T in TULIP music: "ghost riders in the sky" the highwaymen

      it's tuesday again.  i wrote last week about 24 and how it sort of gave tuesday a claim to fame, made it worth looking a bit forward to, because i mean face it, it's tuesday, the only thing it really has going for it is that it's not monday.  i suspect i have an aversion to that particular day of the week that comes from the one semester in college that i had class on tuesday pretty much straight through from 8-5, but that's neither here nor there i don't guess.    anyways, i was talking about how the latest season of 24 finished last week, which would seem to relegate tuesday back to its previous "monday-lite" status.  i mean tuesday seems to lend itself to being a tv nite, and there's so very little that i actually  like  on tv, which i s'pose is more good than bad.  so anyways, when i was younger, probly around ten or so my family were big fans of this show called "the commish" which featured this balding, pudgy guy as commissioner of a suburban police department in new york or somesuch.  it was a solid show, nothing really dramatic, but enough of a story to keep a good pace for an hour and tidily wrap itself up in the same amount of time.  so fast forward about a dozen years or so and you find the same lead actor in a show on fX called "the shield," which is about as different from the commish as different gets, they're both cop shows, but that's pretty much where the similarities end.  the suit-wearing, balding, pudgy commish evolved into this head-shaven, black t-shirt wearing, absolute hardass with a most definite "ends justify the means" mentality.  in contrast to the commish, there's nothing at all tidy about the shield, and given my postmodern sensibilities, that's the sort of thing that made me really dig it.  the combination of the long arcs the stories have (nothing gets wrapped up in an hour) as well as the ambiguity of the characters like vic, the old commish, is the kind of thing that makes you feel really conflicted about wanting him to "win" or even considering him the "good guy."  i started watching it toward the end of this last season, and i s'pose the fact that they ran promos for it during 24 helped, it'd make sense that those shows would draw from similar demographics.  even though the similarity is what drew me in, the shield scratches a bit of a different itch than 24, the drama is just as big, but the stories revolve around smaller stuff, to where disbelief didn't have to be suspended quite so drastically.  24 still rips though.  feeling: unclear thinking of: winnsboro, texas music: "cut the mullet" wesley willis

       second of two   so i have short hair now.    in fact, it's shortest i've had it since that tenth grade year.  that could mean a few different things, for example, people that know me might be inclined to think that it's really not short, as such, based mostly on the fact that my penchant to sport hair that'd always seem to possess some of the qualities one might find in a mop.  right now, however, this isn't the case because my hair's not just short for me, i mean it's  short , like completely devoid of any and all shagginess.  this is a somewhat recent occurance, it happened three weeks ago.  i can't really put my finger on what spurred the desire get it cut, maybe it wasn't really anything at all, i do remember feeling quite impulsive when i went about it.  so anyways, i walked down to supercuts, which i realize was a gamble in and of itself and left pretty much feeling like i did that day sophomore year, feeling like i looked like a dope.  check that, i felt worse, i didn't even have the consolation of going to state this time.  so almost immediately i regretted it, so much so that i thought about taking the clippers to it.  i really felt like it was that bad, but that too would have been impulsive and no solution either.  i feel like more than anything else, what drove me nuts wasn't that it was bad, three weeks out, i can say it really wasn't.  what was most shocking was how drastic a change it was.  it's funny how something as trivial as that can get to be the kind of thing in which you wrap up some concept of yourself.  i mean it wasn't the kinda thing that made me contemplate not leaving the house til it grew out.  i did wear a hat all day the next day, though.  feeling: adjusted thinking of: patience music: "memphis" rancid

       first of two   i used to wrestle.  i started in seventh grade.  everybody remembers seventh grade, nobody, i'm fairly certain remembers it very fondly.  my experience wasn't all that different, there were some things about that year that were totally badass, and plenty of other things; like wrestling, i didn't win a single match that year; that totally sucked.  the thing about seventh grade though, is that you're not really smart enough, or independent or whatever enough to care how you wear your hair.  well, you know what happens as time passes, you get older and you transform from a clueless and totally awkward twelve year old to a dopey and only slightly less awkward fourteen year old.  i wasn't any different.  one of the things that i thought was really cool was that i could grow my hair long.  this had extra appeal mostly because my dad was a really straight-laced, clean-cut type who i'm fairly certain wasn't a huge fan of the shag on my head.  so back to wrestling, it's one of those sports where they care how long your hair is, like there were a few times i'd show up for weigh-ins and the referee would decide my hair was too long and shaggy to wrestle and i'd have to get it cut before i left the locker room.  and then there was the fact that my coach didn't seem to like it either, and he'd cut it himself.  the big deal was sophomore year, my first year to qualify to state, team policy was that every first-time qualifier had to get their head buzzed.  i didn't really like it, but it was state and i didn't have much choice, so i went along.    had i had more of a choice i suspect i would have gone along anyway.   feeling: dopey thinking of: kicking back music: "missle toe" pspazz

      i had a really good thought.  that's how most of these start anyway, with a thought, or something like that, after which i proceed to veer ferociously off topic and write something usually with relevance only to myself and even more frequently of negligible quality.  this practice started a year ago.  it started in this form a year ago, july 28, 2003.  a year ago i appropriated this lil corner of the web and proceeded to hold forth on stuff, well, nothing in paritcular i don't guess.  i'm not sure what i think about all that, i think this is the longest i've ever kept something up that wasn't on some level extrinsically compulsory and i'm both surprised and glad that i've kept it up.  i like writing, i really do, in fact, i started this whole thing because i missed that i wasn't writing regularly like i was when i was in school.  if nothing else the whole thing's kept me in practice, mostly because i get the feeling that writing is gonna play a pretty big part in my life, even if it's in an as yet undefined way.  and then mostly i'm like anybody else, i get tickled reading stuff i've written.  but i digress.  feeling: strangely devoted thinking of: m&m's music: "king of all the world" old 97s

      i realize i'm not the best writer.  maybe i'm not even good, who knows, i never get evaluated or anything.  a couple things i do know, however, is that it's not utterly, utterly vapid and that there are quite a few people around who can't seem to rise above that level of utterly, utterly vapid in their own writing.  i really don't know what to say beyond that, because it's not like anyone who might read this would think "my writing?  vapid?"  i mean i've read some stuff that people have written, strictly amateur, or course and what i've read has really driven me quite nuts, kinda like a thumbtack through the eyeball.  if i've told you that i like your writing, be assured i'm not talking about you.   this whole thing seems uncharacteristically self-indulgent, i mean i don't really enjoy bagging on people's writing, i mean if they're anything like me, a lot of times they're pouring their heart into whatever they're expressing.  i guess what i'd really like to see is an increased level of thoughtfulness, and i guess less self-indulgence.  which means i better shut up now.  feeling: a bit surly thinking of: quality music: "s.o.s" vigilantes of love

       second of two . . .i guess.  you know me.  or maybe you don't, i won't presume to tell you what to do, or what you do or don't do, whatever.  but then if you do know me, i suspect you might have known that i lacked the level of restraint necessary to merely post a list without any commentary, which would be accurate; mostly because right now i'm posting commentary to my list from friday.  i'll try not to make it too long, mostly there were just a few things that i really just sorta felt like i wanted to revisit in a bit more detail.  most of the stuff on there is the kinda stuff that will likely never be the same.  i'm finished with wrestling, so i won't ever get my hand raised at the end of a match again, i'll likely get chances to reconnect with adam, but he's in a different place now, so am i, so those conversations will be markedly different i'm sure.  i'm pretty far removed from wheaton and as such, college, so no more cafeteria breakfasts and i likely won't ever have the kind of schedule that will allow for leisurely conversations with profs.  brad's moved outta that house, so we don't hang out in that garage anymore, though that side room is a pretty solid substitute.  no more summer camps to south padre or to maypearl.  some stuff i'll really get to revisit.  i suspect that i'll end up back in texas at some point, so driving down 1382 in cedar hill is a possibility then.  walking out into a crisp and breezy october morning in dallas like when i stepped outdoors during my layover at D/FW last year, i'll probably get to do as well.  other stuff involves people pretty significantly, stuff that i get to revisit every so often, but not often enough, which is why i miss those things i guess.  me and bone get to do cici's and pancho's once a year, if i visit lisa and she visits me, we get two chances for slurpees, whenever i make it home, i spend more time at my grandparents' than i do at home.  i took a walk with katie last year, but around a lake in north carolina instead of all the streets named after presidents in wheaton, illinois, i sit with laura in church once, maybe twice a year, which ain't nearly enough, but me and her have talked about that.  *sigh*  feeling: slightly powerless thinking of: something good music: "we have forgotten" sixpence

       first of two  sort of  i'm borrowing from bone today, pretty liberally in fact, because i'm just gonna make a list. it's similar to ones that he's done, though i'm not certain he's done exactly this one.    anyways, this here is a list of stuff, in no particular order, that i miss.  driving that stretch of FM 1382 that runs through cedar hill between I-20 and highway 67.  sno-cones from that place down on clarendon in the middle of the hood.  october mornings in texas.  walks with katie that ended with us on the swings next door to fischer.  summers spent listening to the rangers on the radio while i was running around at night in the car.  deep ellum every once in a while.  decompressing at bakers' square.  road trips. . . good gravy, road trips.  pancho's and cici's with bone.  monday nights at my grandparents' house.  fall in wheaton, illinois.  more specifically, the feeling i'd get driving down briarcliffe in between president street and butterfield road mid-morning during october or november.  going down to south padre island for summer camp, the overnight drive.  nights in brad's garage with dunx and brad and whoever else happened to show up.  my bench outside of MSC.  talking about theology with adam.  yelling at the tv with wes.  the pursuer room.  getting my hand raised at the end of a match.  monday, wednesday and friday breakfast in the cafeteria, sometimes with hassler, sometimes not.  slurpees with lisa, and sometimes nate.  the st. mark's invitational.  office conversations with CE and sociology faculty.  sitting at a table at summer camp in maypearl selling t-shirts.  sitting with laura in church.  feeling: a bit empty thinking of: stuff i miss, didn't you see the list? music: "the road to ensenada" lyle lovett

      i buy CDs.  now i don't say that to position myself somehow above the fray because i download music too, there are a few CDs i have that are complete albums that i've burned that i really should have bought, and dozens of other spare songs that are on CDs that i likely wouldn't at all consider buying.  usually i justify that by rationalizing that since i wouldn't have bought the CD anyway, nobody's losing if i download a couple or three songs off of it.    then there's the whole "lars ullrich is a dickhead who doesn't need any more money" argument, which i have to say is mighty compelling, mostly because lars ullrich comes across as a dickhead who doesn't need any more money.  in any case, this morning i saw  urlLink this here article  at relevant which is pretty much the most succinct and convincing argument in favor of abandoning the practice of downloading and burning i've ever read.  it was written by steven christian, the frontman of the indie band anberlin, a band who's in the trenches so to speak.  they don't have a huge following, so it's not like they're sitting around counting money from their million-dollar record deal, they're one of those bands that does a  lot  of touring and counts on the fervent support of a smaller number of fans in order to make a living as well as for justification to remain in the industry.  he goes into detail about the simple cycle of the life of, well, nearly any musical act, and how it's, fairly or unfairly, dependent on record sales.  in explaining how exactly record sales are related to pretty much any other endeavor that a band might undertake, his words work to dispel some of the less thoughtful justifications for downloading and burning.  there are quite a few people justifying CD burning with any number of reasons, maybe by saying that the band doesn't see much money from album sales and that the people who really get rich are the record company execs, so downloading is a way to carry out the time-honored tradition of sticking it to "the man."  a lot of people justify it by saying that going to a live show is more substantial support for a band than is buying one of their CDs, and so on.  those are true only to an extent, however, because while it's true that record companies make a lot of money off of record sales and that bands do make the bulk of their money off touring, christian shows that the level of support a band gets for touring, publicity and future recording is inextricably tied up with how many units they moved previous.  so in the end, however valid those concerns may be, because of the fact that everything goes back to record sales, people who don't buy a band's CDs end up hurting the band more than they do anybody else.  what is boils down to, and this is me independent of the article, on its most basic level is that a lot of people just want to avoid giving up seventeen bucks if they can find a way to keep it themselves and get what they want.  feeling: educated thinking of: thievery music: "hero of the day" metallica

      i'm a pretty easygoing guy.  check that, i'm an  extremely  easygoing guy.  now i don't say that in any sort of prideful way, because like any other personality characteristic, it cuts both ways, and on some occasions i've paid for it; mostly i'm saying out of an extreme, at least in this case,sense of self-awareness.  i remember dunx telling me one time a few years back that i had a talent for "suffering fools," and i think that's the best that anybody's ever put it.  so given all that, the incidences where my temper gets lost, say behind a fit of rage or somesuch, are quite few and far between.  in fact today is seven years to the day from the last time i lost it, seven years ago would put me at age sixteen.  it's quite a story actually, those who've heard me tell it in person will likely recognize it as the story of when i got a girlfriend kicked out of her house.  it happened during the summer before my senior year of high school, and you know how things are at that age, everything is so dramatic, even when it's not, you're young, lack perspective and are, for the most part, stupid.    anyways i s'pose the story starts a few months before that, in march of the same year.  i started seeing this girl to whom a girl-friend of mine introduced me.  things roll along for a few weeks, month and a half, maybe two, but after a while what became increasingly clear is that she was changing, and not so much in a way that was new, but more like she was reverting to something she was before, ostensibly because the means that she employed had acheived their end.  i realize that it's a biased opinion, but i'm a pretty savvy guy and, as such, that development wasn't lost on me.  on the other hand, however, she was pretty hot and the Y chromosome doing what it does led to a delay of another few weeks before i'd decided that i'd pretty much had enough of her being rude, inconsiderate and thoughtless, even if well, nevermind.   so right, july 11, 1997, it was a friday and me and her were s'posed to go to the mall, our friend, the one who'd introduced us was coming too.  i had resolved that that weekend  had  to be it as far as me and her were concerned, as difficult as having that conversation would likely have proved, what i wasn't aware of was that evidently, she had a pretty similar idea but way different means of seeing it played out.  anyway, i pick her up that evening, it seemed early because during the summer in texas, the sun doesn't seem to set before about nine, so i'm figuring that it was probably either a bit before or a bit after seven when i showed up at her house to pick her up.  we head off to the mall, walk around for a while and then run into some guys she knows, i didn't think much of it, i ran into people i knew all the time, and didn't figure it to be a big deal.  evidently, however, it was part of her master plan to get rid of me without any real effort or fuss on her part.  see, she had been planning to meet these guys she'd met at summer school at the mall.  it wasn't really enough for her just to meet them or whatever, i really would have been more relieved than anything else at that point, but she had to use me as a ride and then bank on the hope that i'd get pissed off enough to bail.  like i said before, she wasn't at all a person who could be characterized by anything resembling genuine consideration for another, but in hindsight, even for her, this seemed excessive, it was like she was going out of her way to be rude, going out of her way to make me mad.  anyone that knows me knows what a hopeless and utterly foolish proposition waiting for me to get pissed off is.  she had to have known the same thing because one of the things that she would say to me that she couldn't understand was that i never seemed to get nervous, that there was nothing that would rattle me.  this night was really no different, at least in the beginning, because like i said, i didn't initially think anything of her running into some guys she knew, but as the night went on, the fact that the encounter wasn't a result of chance became more and more evident.  i guess the fact that things weren't going the way she'd planned had sort of irritated her, and especially given what she knew about my personality, her whole plan seemed exceedingly ill-thought-out.  so anyway, a bit later on somebody decides they wish there was a party they could go to, i happened to know of some friends who were able accomodate us as far as that went, i called to make sure that nothing had changed, nothing had, and we were about to be off.  around this point is where i think i started to get irritated, when we got in the cars to head to the party.  she had decided that she was gonna ride with her new friends, and by that point clarity had begun to elbow its way in and i was realizing just how audaciously inconsiderate, if equally poorly thought out, what she was doing was.  in any case, it had turned out that one of these guys wouldn't be able to make it to the party on account of he had to be at work sometime before six the next morning, so he had to be dropped off, he had to be dropped off in red oak.  he lived in red oak.  here is where i give you a lesson about the geography of north texas, mostly because it's pretty relevant to the story.  see, we were in arlington and planning to head to north dallas, which is about a forty minute drive.  i knew my way around pretty well, so getting there wasn't gonna be a problem, but like i said, we had to drop this guy off in red oak.  the thing about red oak is that it's named red oak only because it beat butt-****ing egypt by one or two votes in the election, it was also forty minutes from where we were in arlington, but forty minutes in the opposite direction.  what happens is i have to follow these guys to red oak to drop this guy off, after which the guy that's left follows me to north dallas.  so there we are in arlington, so renowned for its centrality that folks decided to put a baseball stadium in the place, but finding ourselves having to head to red oak, forty minutes south of there on top of being in the middle of nowhere, and subsequently another forty minutes north of there, which made for about two hours of driving.    we get to red oak, and by this time i'm pretty hot, not only because this girl seems to be going way out of her way to really and truly make me mad, but because i'm also working really hard to make sure that, no matter what, i don't give in.  so we're sitting there, waiting for the guy for something or another, and while i'm there in the drivers' seat of my car, she comes to the window and tells me that i can go ahead on, she's staying the night there in red oak.  it was at that point that i turned around on the whole thing, i mean i came to my senses and realized i better start being myself, well, i've always been such an accomodating person, and i realized just how hard she'd worked to get me to lose my temper, i mean i didn't want her to think that all her hard work would be in vain.  so i left, seemingly in a hurry to do so, because i figure that my distance from her would share an inverse relationship with my likelihood to commit, and subequently be charged for and convicted of, a felony.  at that point i'm trying to think of something, and i'll confess to not really thinking too hard because i was so much smarter than her, and a good idea wasn't really long in coming anyway, because as i was trying to navigate my way back to a highway of any consequence the brilliant idea of going back to her house without her dawned on me.  the idea was mostly motivated out of a desire for some measure of revenge, but also a pretty decent helping of a c(over) y(our) a(ss) since i figured that the combo of her not coming home that night along with me being the last person her parents saw her with would lead to a pretty healthy dose of people giving me crap that i didn't want or, given the circumstances, really need to deal with.  the whole rationale there being that since her folks saw her leave with me, i'd be the person they'd call when she didn't show up at home that night.  a while later i show up at her door, her dad answers and summarily, if not understandably, asks me where his daughter is.  i go ahead and tell him "well she's in red oak with some guys she met from summer school or something.  she left, said she was gonna stay the night there, i couldn't really make her get in the car with me or anything," blah blah blah.  he seemed pretty understanding, said that her doing that kinda thing wasn't really a shocker or anything and thanked me for coming over and being honest.  at that point, i was pretty happy, i'd covered myself and gotten over on her.  the last thing i said to her folks in no uncertain terms was that i hadn't been there that night, hadn't talked to them, and didn't really care how they explained it to them.  the best laid plans, blah, blah, blah, you know how it is, because she calls, which i figure happens pretty much immediately after i leave, and tries to tell her parents she's with me, which they know isn't true, you know, having just seen me in their living room moments prior.  the urge was obviously too much for her mother to resist because, from what i hear, she said something to the effect of "bull****!  he was just here!" and then told her to be home in half an hour or not to bother coming home at all.  so genius she is, she decides she'd rather find me and yell at me for getting her in trouble than go back home and actually have a place to, you know, live.  it didn't last, because that was friday night and she stayed with a friend for the weekend, but then the monday or tuesday after that her mom picked her up and read her the riot act before taking her home.  i'd figured i'd heard the last of her but sometime that week, she must have had a (slight) revelation because she called to apologize, i guess that's what it was, to be really honest i don't at all recall what she said, which is just as well i guess, because i do recall that her whole schpiel had this really perfunctory tone about it, as though she was being forced to have the conversation, which i don't really doubt was the case.  that's really about it, i guess, i haven't talked to her or seen her a single time since then.  also on the plus side, i haven't been to red oak since then.  feeling: like i should have been terry tate, the office linebacker thinking of: 1987 toyota corolla music:

      nobody expected this.  i've written before about my affinity for teams from my hometown of dallas, texas, so allow me to diverge once again into related subjects.  this one won't be as involved as the a-rod entries, i don't imagine, but we'll see i guess.  anyways, there are four major teams in dallas, i followed three of them since i was a real lil kid, the stars came around when i was thirteen or fourteen i think, and i never really got into them, which i figure is mostly because they weren't around whenever i was forming my allegiances to the other three teams.  there's definitely a pecking order, the rangers come first, they always have, the mavericks are a close second, and the cowboys come third, not really all that close to the other two.  so there have been times where it's been tough to be a fan, especially of the rangers and the mavericks.  ironically, the cowboys have been by far the most successful.  the mavericks were downright awful for a long time, like when they first started in the early 80s, by the time i picked them up they were pretty good, they made it to the conference finals in 88, losing in seven games to the vaunted los angeles lakers.  the decline after that was precipitous.  they got terrible in a hurry, even worse than when they first joined the league.  bad owners, foolish management, stuff like that.  a while later this nerd billionaire bought the team and they started to get good, really good.  key to their renaissance was the emergence of a nucleus known as the "big three."  the name i was never crazy about, i mean it'd be a good nickname for a guy who needed an extra pant leg up front, but not so much for a group of three basketball players, too vanilla.  anyway, out of the three guys in this lil club, michael finley, dirk nowitzki and steve nash; finley and dirk both got maxed out contracts, the only one who didn't, nash, seemed to simply get unlucky as far as time frames went, his contract just expired and because of his age and the position he plays, he wasn't gonna get a maximum deal.  that was kind of a drag for a lot of people, he's a pretty big fan favorite and had more than proven his worth.  i can't hardly blame him though, it seemed like he was getting pretty jerked around here lately, his name had surfaced in trade rumors, which was pretty presumptuous, since he wasn't under contract to be traded, which also meant that he could pretty much tell the mavs to go play in traffic if they wanted to sign him simply for the purposes of trading him, especially someplace he wasn't totally sold on going.  despite all that though, nobody  really  thought he'd bolt, at least not so quickly, leaving the mavs definitely worse off in the short term which most likely won't make this next season anything to compare to some of the seasons of the mid 90s, but could make it less enjoyable than the paste three or four seasons have been.  big three. . .pant leg. . .that was a good line.  feeling: impertinent thinking of: the dallas mavericks give you nothing but action (hehe) music: "to have and to have not" lars fredriksen and the bastards

      my poor, poor mother.   anno domini  MCMLXXX.  i think that's it anyway, the year of our Lord 1980; it was the hottest summer on record to ever singe the eyebrows and smite the elderly of dallas, texas.  according to locals who were around for both of them, the only summer that rivals that one was the one eighteen years later, in 1998.  now i was around for that summer and if 1980 was worse than that one, i don't even want to deign to ponder what it must have been like.  now i mentioned my poor mother because she spent nearly the entire summer of 1980 lugging me around inside her even slighter than it is now 18 year old frame, 1980 was in fact the summer that i made my first appearance on our fair planet.  so i'm 24 today, and i'm fairly certain that it'll be a good day, i mean as long as i don't get taken roller skating and no family members of mine get shot.  other than that there's not really much to it, i mean i s'pose it'd be exceedingly easy to talk about all the sort of standard, small-talky birthday stuff, you know, like "wow made it through another year," "how's it feel to be  year older?", stuff like that, but the banality of that might drive me to self-destructive behavior, i'm thinking bamboo shoots underneath fingernails right this second.   urlLink gordon keith 's held forth on the subject of birthdays, though i'm not certain he's done it on his blog, but he's more or less of the opinion that after childhood, birthdays really have no use being acknowledged.  i agree with him in that with a few exceptions, birthdays after about age 12 or 13 aren't really and shouldn't be a big deal, but i don't go as far as him in declaring it solely another day on the calendar.  what i look forward to the most are lil things, the notes, the cards, stuff like that, in fact i would be fine if i never had another birthday party as long as i lived.  i guess what i appreciate most about birthdays is that they provide an opportunity for thoughtfulness, which goes both ways, i'm like anybody else, i appreciate being told that i'm being thought of, and i really get a rush when i'm able to do something nice for someone else, i think i was more excited to get bone the DVDs of the first season of 24 than he was to get them and i was nearly giddy to send laura her birthday box last year.   on the other hand, i don't guess that we should need any special occasion for thoughtfulness, but that'd seem to be fodder for another entry entirely.  feeling: good thinking of: the old conditioning test music: "amalgamate" five iron frenzy

      i've been listening to an inordinate amount of the old 97's lately.  pretty much anybody that's heard them knows that that's not necessarily a bad thing, not at all, they're a great band, i don't think i've met a single person who's ever really listened to them and held a negative opinion.  in fact having found them a few years back was a pretty significant emotional coup.  people who know me and are familiar with my musical tastes likely know that i've got a lot of happy music, a lot of what i guess could be described as music for the rage prone, a  smattering  of what's known as pop, and a mishmash of some older country; willie nelson, johnny cash, merle haggard, guys like that, who wrote country music when country music was good.  what i didn't have was music for those melancholy moods that come every so often, and make no mistake, even with my sickeningly sunny disposition, they come.  part of the reason is that so much of that kinda music absolutely sucks and is relegated to the hipster crap that people my age who fancy themselves urbane seem to think is really cool.  what i'm saying is that i can generally tolerate music like that for a few minutes before i start making decisions with long term implications to solve a short term problem, for example, throwing my stereo out the window in order to get it to stop.  in any case, all of that is fine, mostly because i can only stomach myself for so long when i'm in a mood like that.  so anyways, back to music, like i was saying, finding stuff that's at least tolerable for moods somewhere in between happy and homicidal (not that the two are necessarily mutually exclusive) is tough, for a while all i had that fit the bill was mike ness' first solo CD, which is some great music and really versatile as far as moods go, but almost too much so for what i was looking for.  so i really hate advertising my own likes and dislikes here, at least as far as evaluating things for public consumption in a sort of "review-ish" style, in fact if you can find an example of me doing that, i'll buy you lunch sometime; but anyways, the old 97's have found a niche for the moods that caedmon's call or even mike ness wasn't quite right for.  if only there was a strecth of road out here that corresponded.  feeling: oddly fulfilled thinking of: oak cliff music: "weightless" old 97's
