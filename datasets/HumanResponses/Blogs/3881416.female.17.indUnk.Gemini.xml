      after hogging the computer for about an hour or two last night, i went straight up to my room. i had to do three exercises in my french module... they were pretty easy. but i also had to make a dialogue between a traveller and a ticket-seller. "je voudrais..." haha.  hirap.  i wonder what my ma'am will say to the one i made.  after that i planned to sleep right away, it was around 11:30pm when i finished. but i spotted the book "tess of the d'urbervilles". omg!  'di ko pa pala natatapos yan? konti na rin naman pala eh.  so i picked the book up and read it. by this time, the cd i was listening to was on its second round of its songs... i managed to rush the book in time for the last song of the cd. hehe. i was already groggy but my mind didn't want to sleep yet. i switched the radio to NU107 to try and get to sleep.  hindi pa rin.   so i got to thinking about lots of stuff... i thought about the book i just read and the book i read before it. they were both written by thomas hardy. man, that author really writes heavy stuff. i felt depressed after reading both his books. i almost cried out of frustration last night. haha. i felt really bad about "tess" 'cause her situation made me think about mine last tuesday. hayy. revelations. i'm glad my friends love me with "a love that does not alter if alterations it finds". :] (eto na naman ako... kumokorny!! nyahaha.).  speaking of friends again... i remember this paper i found in our soc sci classroom-- i picked it up and found it was an article like those you can find in peyups. one line caught my eye: "i've learned that we don't have to change friends just because friends change". hmmm... hehe.&nbsp;  'di pa rin makatulog... ang lamig pa ng&nbsp;legs ko kagabi; umuwi ba naman ako ng 7:30pm ng naka-mini skirt? tinapat ko pa yung electric fan sa'kin pagkahiga sa kama. :p late na late na ng medyo nakatulog ako... narinig ko kasing pumasok yung ate ko sa kwarto eh.     &nbsp;   tama ba namang&nbsp;gumigising ka ng alas-sais kahit alas-dos ka ng nakakatulog?

      haha. just learned some new french phrases... those mean "i'm very sleepy!" and "i'm very hungry!" respectively.  bagay sa'kin no?  :] finally, my seatmate, carleen&nbsp;mustered enough courage to ask our teacher what "i love you" in french was. she's been asking me that ever since the term started. as if i know! apparently, she wants to say "je t'aime" to her boyfriend. nyerkz. for that, our teacher also taught us that "un petit ami" and "une petite amie" mean boyfriend and girlfriend respectively. sheesh.  lahat tuloy sila nagkaroon ng interes sa french, haha.  now i know what it takes to get students interested in learning a language, maybe i could use that in the future if i can't find a job and finally decide to teach. hehe.   ----------------   watched a film with katty and kepi this afternoon. 'lost in translation'. pretty good. it didn't really leave an impression on any of us [baka si kepi, pero kami ni katty hinde]. hayy. kepi, how are you? just read your blog...  sana oks ka pa, dito lang kami.     &nbsp;   ---  speaking of friends, i wonder how guia is right now?  'di nagpaparamdam si gaga. hehe. &nbsp;but really, i'm worried. i also kind of miss rey. i haven't spoken to him in weeks! i managed to at least have quality time with kaye. we updated each other about ourselves... i found out that noesis is having problems too. tsk. got even more worried. it made me feel bad that i don't know much about my friends nowadays... i can't wait 'til ruth's debut. it'll be a chance to catch up with each other. :]   kepi!! ayaw magpost ng pic!!!! grgrgrgr, hehe.  pano ba?    oo nga pala... sa mga hindi nakakaalam... sira ang cellphone ko! syet, mahirap na akong kontakin at makakontak. waah. 'di ako sanay. ayoko man aminin, pero mahirap ang buhay ng walang selpown!!! ;p    &nbsp; hayy. lagot ako kay tad. tagal ko na naman sa computer. hehe. sorry. :]&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;      &nbsp;   yey! nakakain na ulit ako ng cake sa Oz! sarap sarap. :]

      yesterday. we had this speaker in soc sci 1. ma'am pj's friend who is gay. he gave us a talk about same sex relationships and whether the filipino society accepts it or not. well, it wasn't exactly a lecture, more like an open forum. the only people who were really active that day were ramon, adee, another girl and i. haha.  first time kong maging active sa soc sci class namin!!  what came as a shock to me was mr. speaker's slight background about himself. he told us he was gay [obviously] and that he really was more interested in guys:  "i prefer men ha, not boys."  the surprising thing was, he admitted that his parents still don't know he's gay. he's 25 yrs. old now and all his friends accept his homosexuality but he hasn't even told his parents yet...  tsktsktsk, good luck sa kanya :]  i'm glad i finally had a chance to participate in a soc sci class. it was a change in the routine and it was good.  --------------------  switch code... kakatamad na mag-english, wala pa akong matinong tulog eh. haha. kahapon, nantrip kami ni manix, alam niyo ba yung mga bulag sa may philcoa? yung sa may chowking? haha. yun. :] malas nga eh, may nakita pa akong dalawang taong 'di ko inaasahang makita nung mga oras na yun pero ayos lang... bahala na, matagal ko na rin silang hindi nakikita at nakausap eh. tsaka may feeling ako na matagal pa bago ko sila makikita ulit. tsk. anyway, pagkatapos nun... KONTRAGAPI training na naman. may bago akong natutunan, astig! kakaaliw. tapos... yun... ang aga pa nun. ayoko na namang umuwi ng maaga eh, wala naman akong mauuwian, wala akong gagawin kung umuwi ako ng maaga. kaya sinamahan namin si katty sa event na inorganize nina ate kitty. galing ni katty, isa na siyang ganap na manghuhula!! haha, binabayaran na!! :] late na... 'di ko namalayan ang oras. kailangan nang makitulog sa ibang bahay hehe. nagpaalam na lang ako kay mommy para hindi ko na kailangang umuwi.  pagkatapos nung acoustic night nina ate kitty, dumaan naman kami ni katty at manix sa kule office. birthday daw ng gf ni leklek at imbitado si manix. naki-epal lang kami ni katty hehe ;] . sandali lang kami dun... bumaba na rin kami kasi nag-iinuman sina ate kitty and friends sa sunken. mmmsarap, ginpomelo. hehe. sumama rin si beng kahit sandali. usap-usap. tapos yun, go katty! fan mo ako ha, tandaan mo yun. usap-usap lang. buong araw akong nakikipag-usap, pati nung gabi. ---- umuwi na rin kami kina katty. balak ubusin ni ate kitty yung natitirang magic juice. waahh, inantok ako eh. silang dalawa nalang tuloy ni manix umubos. usap-usap na naman. sila lang, nakatulog kasi ako eh. pagkagising ko, nag-uusap pa rin silang tatlo, antibay! elibs ako kay ate kitty, parang di tinatamaan! halos naubos na rin yung magic juice kaso naabutan na kami ng araw at inantok na ang lahat. ayun, wala lang. umuwi rin kami ng mga 7am. ang aga kaso uwing-uwi na ako, hinahanap na rin ako sa bahay eh. :]  yun lang.  ------------------------  this afternoon, mom, lyn and i bonded with each other at chocolate kiss. it felt good to just be with them. mom was feeling blue so she decided to visit lyn at work. i tagged along 'cause i needed to go to UP anyway. our stay there was pretty long and we talked about A LOT of stuff. anything and everything almost.   after that, i went to katty's. that's where we usually meet before going to train for kontra. when i got there, kepi had arrived and he and katty were playing the guitar. talked about stuff again. waited for katty to bathe and for ria to arrive. talked. talked and listened. nice music. talked and ate.  ayan na rin pala si ria.   tara, punta na sa kontra.   we were taught a new piece today. i liked it. it's kind of hard to play but i hope i'll manage. i just need to practice.  yun lang ulit...  &nbsp;   nakakabangag. ang gulo ng post, walang kwenta. hehe. nakakalito tuloy. hindi consistent yung points of view. kakaantok eh.

      yesterday was fun. :] classes were suspended at 12 noon so we had the whole afternoon to do anything we wanted to. kepi and i had lunch at  katag  where manix met us. katty followed soon after. it was decided that we would go watch  Imelda  at robinson's metro east. okay. okay na documentary.  salamat nga pala kay manix!! :]  we started the movie at around 4 and it ended at around a quarter to six. after that we didn't have anything else to do. katty had to go home because... hehe. we all took a jeep to katipunan, where we went our separate ways... katty and kepi to UP, manix and i to Cubao. the original plan was to go home... haha. instead, we got down near the LRT2 station and decided to look around the  ukay-ukay  stores. saw some cool shirts and skirts.  sayang lang, wala kaming pera! hehe.   aryan! ukay tayo next week diba?   anyway, after looking through 2 stores we started to make our way to the overpass.  aba, umulan ng malakas, badtrip.  we only had one umbrella to use so we got wet anyway.  sobrang lakas nung ulan!!!  so yun... we decided to get wet through and through anyway. manix lent me his jacket so my bag wouldn't get too wet. hehe. we passed by 2 more stores before really going home. by the time we reached the house the rain stopped.  nge, bitin! haha.  i offered to lend him an extra shirt but he refused.  hindi ka naman siguro nagka-sipon no? :] tsktsktsk. &nbsp;when i got inside, i quickly checked the guitar he lent me.  naku, baka basang-basa na!  it was fine. i just had to wipe it a bit. i emptied the guitar case so i could let it dry.  ayos!  :]   ---------------------  well, when i got home, selena was there, so i decided to talk to her about that thing...  tamang-tama, she followed me into our room.  while wiping the guitar, i nervously asked her if i could talk to her about something. she was currently playing her acoustic and singing then so she replied by nodding. and so--- i told her. i didn't cry at first. i never felt bad before this. i always kept it at the back of my mind... half-forgetting it, hoping it never happened at all. but when i watched her face contort into various emotions in mere seconds i felt awful. we cried together and started talking talking and talking.  maybe talking about it would make me completely forget it...  i think not. i will always remember it. but, finally telling someone about it and talking about it has made it lighter for me. easier to accept it. i'm so glad i decided to talk to lyn. i love my sister. :] hayy. i'm feeling better already.  &nbsp; yun lang. kain na ako. hayy.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  kadiri, nasagap ng paa ko yung essence ng cubao kagabi... yung nilakaran namin medyo baha. nyak. pati overpass, baha! haha. -sabon-alcohol-sabon-sabon- hehe.

      i forgot to mention yesterday... although it's been bothering me all sunday. while waiting for our turns at the computer yesterday morning, selena and i talked. oh, about the usual stuff...  how was last night? what did you do?  i don't know how, but our conversation took a different turn and -- she revealed something to me. i admit i was taken aback by what she told me.  oh my gosh...  but i didn't show it. i remained calm. well, the reason why i was shocked was well, of course, who wouldn't be shocked by it? another reason was... well, i had a similar exprience. probably, mine is even worse psychologically [hindi ako baliw ngayon ah ;)] --  syet , it happened a long time ago and i'm not even sure anymore if it really did. she didn't explain more to me so i don't know what really happened. but because she didn't tell me more, i couldn't bring myself to tell her about me. i plan to talk to her about it soon. hopefully tonight. hayy. grabe. wala lang.  it sucks. i wish it wouldn't happen to anybody else.  fuck all the stupid-asses in this world.  nobody knows about my experience so i don't know how i'm going to start talking to her. but it's best if we open up to each other. :]   ---------------------   we have a report today...  bad trip, sana masuspend yung mga klase ng 10!  go group!    &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;   ^_^  miss ko na tumugtog! hehe.

      yey! arianne and katte both came home to manila for the weekend... astig!! we all met at katty's house yesterday after lunch. i missed them so much... [uuyy, ngingiti na sila! hehe]. we talked about our band and tried to decide what songs we planned to play for ruth's debut. syempre, as usual, we didn't get to decide. haha. :] it's too bad katte wasn't allowed to go home late 'cause then she wasn't able to come with us to jesser's birthday thing...  and so... jesser's nineteenth birthday bash. haha. tsktsktsk.  daming nangyari, leche! grabe.  of course, hindi mawawalan ng inuman yan. we arrived at aryan's house at around 6 pm, i think. but the 'party' started at around 7-7:30.  syet, balik bisyo . i was kind of amazed at how much alcohol they were planning to consume... 3 long-neck bottles of emerador and a case of redhorse. the session started out okay. we met some new people [hello jesser's friends!]. lahat sila fine arts students ng FEU. astig.  i only knew 2 out of all the people jesser invited from FEU: allan and engel. hehe kaya okay. the only person whose name i can remember is jake.  tanggero . the first bottle was nearly empty when i started feeling ... tipsy. hehe. i didn't feel bad yet so i just kept going.  okay pa naman talaga eh.  i was feeling alright&nbsp;until suddenly, while staring at my celphone,  aba, ba't biglang dumami ata selpown ko?!  haha. woozy. my hand lost its grip on my phone and  blag!  i dropped it. i couldn't move  at all.  no matter how much i wanted to pick my phone up,&nbsp;i couldn't. i think kepi did it for me. anyway, i don't how why but i kept picking my phone up from the table and so i guess i dropped around 4 times last night.  buti buhay pa siya. &nbsp;i was aware of everything happening  around me  but not what &nbsp;was happening  to me.  i wanted to react to katty and her palm reading but i couldn't. i wanted to tell aryan that i could hear her and kepi talking about me and... but i couldn't. :] tsktsk. hehe. if i remember correctly i think i emptied my stomach around 6 times. jeez.  buti buo pa yung tiyan ko ngayon hehe.  wah, last night just made my ulcer worse. the funniest thing about last night is, i vaguely remember bending over with my head under the table. aryan helped me up again and tried to guide me. i guess i crashed my head into the table anyway 'cause i have a slight bruise on the top of my forehead. nyak.  so yun... salamat kina aryan, kepi at allan sa pag-alaga sa'kin hehe. salamat kay bodz sa astig na bertday party.  :] anyway, enough of that. i'm still alive anyway.  sa ngayon,  i don't feel bad. i only feel heavy. badtrip lang, way to katty's the jeepney driver next to me smoked a stick of winston reds... man, i wanted to puke. and just now, my brother tad opened a bottle o isopropyl alcohol and i felt kind of woozy because of the smell. haha.  tama na kasi. tsktsktsk.    ----------------------------  KEKA the reunion... hehe. katty, aryan, katte and i decided to go visit pards this afternoon to practice. it's been what, 3 months since we last practiced together as a band. wow.  tagal na pala.  we've all been caught up in our own lives... so yun... we practiced and it felt great to just play and play and play with my bandmates. we didn't play anything new, just the old favorites. we polished up&nbsp;the song&nbsp; Freya . we also tried to clean up the way we'd play kepi's song  my star . it's a nice song, i love the chords katte.  galing mo.  the practice lasted about 2 hours i think. but we still haven't finally decided what to play on august 14.  bahala na.  :] as usual,  dahil malakas kami kay pards,  we didn't have to pay!! hehe. thank you pards. what was funny was, when pards didn't accept the payment for 2 hours worth of practice, he said,  "ah, saka na lang... mga iskolar naman kayo dito sa  pards' school of rock ".  haha. :] sure...  we ended the day by eating a few isaw apiece.  sarap!    &nbsp;  &nbsp;  --we love our bread, we love our butter, but most of all, we love each other. :]  haha. wala lang. naalala ko lang. sa madeleine cartoon yan eh. di ko alam kung bakit ko tinayp.

      Wow, i managed to go through another soc sci class without sleeping the entire time...  yeh!! achievement yun!   it's so hard to keep awake when your teacher just goes on and on about stuff that you've already tackled in highschool. my eyes weren't even focusing on anything anymore. i could feel that they were open but all my eyes could perceive was a world that seemed to be behind a sheet of falling water.  blur lang talaga ang lahat.  what's weird was i knew i was half-asleep but i couldn't bring myself to concentrate on the lecture. i felt slightly ashamed because i knew ma'am pj could see me gaping at her without absorbing anything coming out of her mouth. haha. i had to turn my face away.  pa-simple pa ako kanina.  jake, my seatmate asked me, "oi, okay ka lang? sleepy?" i forced my face to smile slightly and replied, "hmm? oo... obvious naman eh, pati si mam, nao-obvious na niya yung pagka-antukin ko......." i don't think he understood what i was saying then; i guess i mumbled half of what i said hehe. anyway... i begged mariel to help me keep awake. and you know what she did? she crushed my right hand in her left fist! i almost swore out loud!!  ansakit mariel! haha exagg naman yun... baka di na ako makatulog kailanman!  haha, well it serves me right for being sleepy. :]  ------------------------------  before our soc sci class nga pala... kepi, ria and i went to the blockbooster thing early this morning. katty was still at home when the frat guys called our team.  uy, laban na kayo.   syet! talo kami! haha. it's okay. katty reassured me by telling me that maybe the other people competing needed the money more.  sa luho lang naman natin gagamitin yung pera eh.  hehe. go mommy! bait mo. :]  ------------------------------  while kepi, ria and i were eating at  katag,  the rain suddenly came pouring down. argh!! i don't like it when it rains. that limited us to staying in FC of course. where else could we go anyway? we stayed a little longer in  katag.  there was a time when all three of us became quiet [o diba? posible pala yun]. i fell to thinking about -- stuff. again. as usual. i also kind of wondered what kepi and ria were thinking too but i never asked. :] anyway, i can't recall all of what i was thinking then... i just remember thinking about -- myself... and others.  medyo magulo yung iniisip ko nun eh. andaming pwedeng pag-isipan -- may masaya, may nakakalito, may nakaka-asar.   on a lighter note, i remember staring at my cup of nestea iced tea... i noticed that my plastic cup had the caption 'take the plunge' [yun ba yung eksakto? hehe], and i thought,  grabe, favorite commercial ko nga pala nung maliit pa ako eh yung commercial ng nestea... yung may humiga sa picnic blanket tapos naging swimming pool bigla yung blanket... astig yun eh. syet! childhood!! haha.  after this thought passed through my mind, i then thought,  tangina naman... ba't ang weird ko mag-isip? haha. nababaliw na ata ako.  so, i decided not to share that particular thought with sina ria and kepi. hehe. sorry. back to my thoughts then... i don't know why, but after that, i just listened to the rain and then suddenly the song  minsan  by the eraserheads played in my mind. what was cool was, i couldn't hear eli buendia's voice... all i could here were just the instruments. astig. it was so sad... the music was so sad. its made me feel depressed and at the same time a bit ... happy? haha. weird. seriously, i had mixed feelings then. it was too much for me so i mentioned it to kepi and ria. haha. kepi laughed a bit... at me i think. gagu! hehe. wahhh... weird. ;p  -------------------------  we watched the filipiniana dancers a few hours ago. they were pretty good. the show was nice but, what with the rain and the cold, i became sleepy half-way through the show. hehe.  after that, we went to meet manix at casaa.  acoustic night pala ng up underground.  too bad we didn't get to see some of the bands.  -------------------------  arrived home at around ten or ten thirty... tired and cold but happy.  puro tawa kami nina katty kanina, tsk. bangag talaga kami.  thank you manix for accompanying me. :] astig.  antok na ako.  &nbsp;   ps: haha, nakakatawa... tinanong ni ate nila nung isang araw kung may gusto akong ipa-grocery. sabi ko "peanut butter! miss ko na bahay ni katty eh... kahit ano basta peanut butter!! hahahaha." ayan... pagdating sA bahay kanina... "ate, may pagkain pa?" meron! aba'y pagbukas ko pa ng ref kanina para kumuha ng tubig... "waw! peanut butter!! haha. ludy's pa!! haha. mahal ako ni ate nila!" grabe, kahit kumain na ako ng dinner, kumain pa ako ng 2 peanut butter sandwiches... yan tuloy, supercharged ako ngayon at ang haba ng post ko. :]

       Dating gawi?   I'm starting to go back to my old habit of coming home late. I remember in highschool [not so long ago, haha.] I used to come home at around 9-10pm --- and I mean leaving for the house at 9-10pm! When college started, I started coming home early. It's a lot more tiring than highschool; what with the strain of adjusting to the classes and trying to remember every single person you've met. I usually managed to be at my house at 7pm.  Well now,  dating gawi...  it's not even my fault that I come home late nowadays. Before, i used to like coming home late. I liked being away from home.  When college started, I longed to be at home in bed. But now, because of our KONTRAGAPI&nbsp;training the earliest I could be home would be around 9-10pm again.  BUT... 3 days a week lang yung training. haha. What about the other days? I still come home late on other days because I've rediscovered the comforts of just being with my friends and talking to them [hehe, cheesy!!! babangasan nyo na ako 'pag nakita niyo ako.].   hayy... cornycornycornycornycorny.   -----------------------   I forgot to mention in my last post... Watched a film yesterday: "Talk to her". galing. It was great! It was worth a lot more than the 50 bucks we payed for it.  Today, saw another film: "21 grams". galing din. Watched it with the same people... although yesterday Lyn didn't get to sit with me and Manix.   -----------------------   After watching "21 grams", went to watch Sir Edru and KONTRAGAPI members perform for free at the CAL new building. Astig yung performance. I wish we could do that someday.   -----------------------   By the way, about the blockbooster, our team was the first to participate and the first to win! naks! galing namen! haha. sana ganun din bukas... panalo. :]   &nbsp;    saan tayo makakahanap ng cake na masarap?&nbsp;&nbsp; ----sa Oz cafe masarap!

      wait, i just want to start things off with a laugh: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!  &nbsp; syet. i just came home from a 4-night getaway at katty's house... her mom asked me if i could stay over at their house for a few nights just so i could keep katty company on account of their only helper left the house. when katty texted me tuesday night i thought she was joking! it turns out her mom was serious. i thought,  "four nights?? tagal din nun ah. sige, astig 'to, nakakahiya nga lang..."  i asked my mom if she would let me and she did.&nbsp;originally, i was only supposed to stay until friday night but my friends and i decided to go to Beatles night in Libis so my stay was extended until last night.  for the past four days, katty and i&nbsp;did not do&nbsp;anything much... we just ate... and ate... and ate. hehe. actually, if you ask her, she'd say all our bingeing was my fault. and it is. i have been wanting to eat a lot this past week. maybe it's because eating takes my mind off things... and stuff. SARAP KUMAIN!!!  &nbsp; ----------------------- &nbsp; by the way, katty, kepi and i watched "the prince and me" last thursday. it was okay but ordinary. the story was very typical... you know, a fairy tale come true story. in my opinion, it was only worth 45-50 pesos of the 66 we paid to watch it hehe. &nbsp; ----------------------- &nbsp; last night, we went to beatles night at centro, libis. kiko machine played, which is why manix invited us to watch, and they were great. galing sobra. then blue stellar performed; they played a few beatles songs. okay. problem child came next and they were pretty good. it was the first time i've seen them perform. last were the mongols... yeh! astig. it wasn't my first time to watch them live but it was my first to see them in a venue as small as a bar. GALING!!!!! i especially loved their cover of "i'm only sleeping". galing talaga. i'll never forget their performance. :D &nbsp; ----------------------- &nbsp; ang corny ko talaga gumawa ng entry. tinatamad na ako. dapat nga nag-aaral ako para sa unit exam namin sa french10-11 bukas eh. hayyy. i have a feeling i'm going to have to delete this blog next week. i'm too lazy to keep it updated. haha. ayoko na. &nbsp; &nbsp;  nice shirt

      wow. my fourth post. i never thought i'd go past 2, hehe.  to kepi: salamat pala sa iyong compliment dun sa isa mong comment... tsaka pano ko mapapalitan yung time zone settings ko?? mali nga siya... waaahhh. tsaka mag-iingat ako hehe.  i really have been feeling emotionally stressed out lately. i've been thinking about certain things too much. i can think of 4 major things that have been crowding my mind for about 2 weeks now. i alternately think about them all the time. argh. but not all of them are distressing, just confusing hehe. maybe this is why i've been eating a lot lately.   ang sarap kumain!!!  once classes end each day, i look for food to eat even if i'm not hungry at all. sheesh. ubos pera ko agad. haha. which brings us to....  katty, kepi, ria and i have decided to join this trivia contest in school. we want to earn money and this seemed like a good opportunity. it requires groups of 3-5 people to compete against each other.  padamihan ng alam na trivia.  anything under the sun, they said. i hope we win!! shit, the grand prize is Php20,000! haha. ayos. to those who read this, wish us luck.  omaygad. my posts are shit. haha.  goodluck sa'yo edwina salang!    i wanna eat --- A SLICE OF CHOCOLATE CAKE FROM OZ CAFE!!!

      a lot of things have been happening. a lot of things have been talked about. a lot of things have been planned. where do we start?  yesterday, all we did during EL50 was just finish the movie 'hellen of troy'. it was an okay film, considering it was made years ago. it was fun to laugh at all the corny romantic lines. i have nothing against romantic lines but everything paris and hellen said to each other was so... predictable? haha. i'd like to let my friends see that movie, i want to see their reactions. English30 --- checked a test yet again. French10-11 --- waahhh... it's starting to become difficult. even more so, my seatmate keeps asking me again ang again what the teacher just said. i feel kinda bad when i can't repeat what the prof just said but i can't help it. i don't actually listen. i normally just stare out the window. i don't even know how i manage to be one of the top scorers in tests (haha! yabang! ;] pero totoo). that's what also happens during math1. i don't listen but somehow i catch up. ayos nga eh. hehe.  lately, i've been feeling so tired. my friends and i haven't been doing anything physically draining... but i still feel exhausted. is it because of the emotional drain that the tarot cards have told me about? or am i just being paranoid? but really... maybe it is. i've been pondering too much lately. i have been having a hard time concentrating on my studies, especially that shitload of readings for soc sci1. i can't help it. i have to let it out of my system. anyway, in the long run, if i keep everything in, i might explode. so there, even if telling my friends about my woes and worries and my nonsense analyses drains me of my physical strength, at least my emotional strength gets refreshed. haha. anaknamputcha. haaaaaah!!! everything's coming out. it feels so good to just talk and try to get things straight!  --------------  how do people earn money? how can we earn money? as usual, during our little talks, katty, kepi and i [and ria kahit wala siya dun] have decided to look for ways to earn money.   money for what?   wala lang... we want to do lots of things!!!! argh, i don't even know how to start enumerating all the things we want to do!!!!  and to add to my financial frustrations, my brother came up to me a while ago and said, "hey dwin, my friends gonna sell his electric guitar..." oh man, kailangan ko ng PERA!!! he started telling me about it: it's a flying V, original, gibson guitar... i'd have to fix it though, it doesn't have pick-up, frets, etc. pero hello? ayos na yun!!! syet. haha.  ang haba ng post ko. ayoko na. hehe

      good morning!! haha, i woke up so early again. damn this stupid body clock of mine! i don't know why but i always seem to get up at 6 am. sheesh.  so it's monday again. another week of pretending to learn something. as usual, i'm having a hard time concentrating on lectures, i always seem to find something more interesting outside the classrooms, hehe. the days are going by so fast. parang kelan lang inisip ko na, "syet, monday na naman... may math na naman ako mamaya!" classes have been going on for more than a month now but i feel that i've hardly learned anything new.  --------------------  saturday was fun. arianne came home from los banos. i didn't expect much to happen, only we were supposed to attend this art workshop at the CCP. 50 pesos lang daw. it turns out we didn't attend the workshop! we only took a quick look at the KASIBULAN exhibit. ganda sobra. we then went back down to the first floor. on the way down, we had some fun with the escalators ;]. seeing the CR, i realized i had to pee so i dragged everyone except kepi inside. "waw, astig! anlaki ng CR!" haha. after that, my friends and i debated whether we should attend the workshop or not. we decided... not. instead we took a cab to intramuros!!! haha. trip na naman. i love it when my friends and i do stuff without planning. :] once in intramuros we started walking around and looking for stuff to do. we spotted this catering place that had a sign that said it was a resto. "how 'bout some coffee?" nope. sorry, the sign also said they were closed. haha. so then we started walking again. we didn't have any particular place in mind to go to. but we found ourselves standing outside CASA MANILA and thought, 'hey, let's go in. Php15 lang!!!' it was really worth it. we explored every nook and cranny of the old house. i loved it... i actually want a house like that, only with happier furniture, hehe. it's too bad katty's videocam was acting up so we couldn't document our trip. the only scenes that were caught were our taxi rides. sayang. after the museum. we didn't know what else to do so we started walking aimlessly around again. when we got to the road with all the former presidents' faces staring at us we started naming them one by one. haha. galing nga ni kepi eh, kilala niya lahat. :] what else? wala. we took a cab back to katty's house. traffic! sakto, when we were in UP, the rain came pouring down. so insteAd of going home right away, we all sat down at her dining table and started eating biscocho. hehe. as usual, we had to make do with limited resources... peanut butter, cream and condensed milk. hmmm.... sarap!! :] yun lang. i suck at writing-- i'm much better at telling stories when i can see the person i'm talking to. haha. pagpasensyahan nyo na....   oo nga pala. selena and i went out yesterday to watch 'mean girls' . it was an okay movie. very funny actually. it's nice to just watch something shallow sometimes. :]  :]  i wanna eat ----- CREPES!!!!

      i didn't get to create a post yesterday... lyn woke up early and naturally, the older sister has to use the computer first hehe. well, as i mentioned in my last post, manix and i watched 2 plays at the up theater.  galing!!  they were funny, actually. the only thing that irritated me that time were the noisy students from marikina science high sitting in front of us. but i don't really blame them, we used to be the same way when our class would watch plays like that. after the plays, manix and i paid a visit to katty. actually, we just passed by for her amplifier, hehe. we didn't have anything else planned so we just grabbed a bite at the isaw stand. it rained while we were at the waiting shed by the chapel... grgrgrgrgr. :]  buti nalang may jacket para matakpan yung amp!!  yun... we went home after that.  yesterday, we didn't have EL50. sir baizas said that he did not get to reserve tha avr so we'll just watch 'julius caesar' on thursday instead.  grego, lei and i [they're my groupmates] went to shopping center. lei had to have something printed for her father and so we decided to board a jeep to SC. but, grego started ranting about the jeepney fare and all the crap about student fare and stuff. of course he wasn't really serious about the injustice of the fare hike... he just wanted us to walk. and so we walked... it was hot. grgrgr. hehe. but it was fun to spend some time with those groupmates of mine 'cause we all had some stories to tell about ourselves. after printing, we made our way back to FC. grego and i showed lei the BETAWAY. i can't believe she didn't know that the road by the chapel leads to the acad oval. :] by the time we reached the CAL new bldg, i was pooped. i got really tired by our little excursion. eng30: we checked the test papers and then discussed the next lesson on grammar. i fell half-asleep again and ma'am noticed and called me to read the next paragraph, hehe. nyak!! :] after that, everything went well. i actually got to know my seatmate JR more. he's nice, i think he's gay hehe. french10-11: we just reviewed all the lessons very fast. man, we're going to have our finals today!!!!  today!!!!  syet!! :p math: just had a short lesson and a short seatwork. i didn't fall asleep this time 'cause i was busy reviewing myfrench module.  after class, kepi, katty and i ate at katag.  gastos na naman hehe.  after that, we went to katty's house. we didn't stay long 'cause dayen texted katty that rey was looking for us near sunken garden. and so we made our way to sunken... saw rey. talked a bit. he updated me about his lovelife. well, i wouldn't exactly say 'lovelife' 'cause i don't think he really 'loves' the girls he texts. no offense rey! ;] hayy, naku. labo ni rey, daming girlet. tsktsktsk  yun lang.

      i haven't had a decent night's sleep in almost a week. i'm not used to sleeping late anymore...  last friday... i watched cold mountain with manix. it was a very nice movie. although, i kind of fell asleep somewhere in the middle. don't get me wrong, it wasn't boring. i was just sleepy. the movie took longer than expected [2 and a half hours]. i was shocked to find out it was almost seven when it finished! for that, we had to rush to FC... i made it just in time for kontragapi training. haha. :]  badtrip nga eh,  the training ended at around 8pm. grgrgrgrgr. but no matter, i enjoy playing the new piece. :]  at 8pm, katty, kepi and i made our way to the college of science. there was going to be an event organized by the geosoc... acoustic night and a fashion show/beauty contest. ria didn't come 'cause she had to go home. kiko machine was going to perform and genn and i decided to go home after they played so we waited. and because the whole thing started late, they only got to play at around 10:30. tsk! hehe,  lagot ako 'pag pauwi na... late na.  but it was okay for me to go home, genn and manix were accompanying me to cubao. yey,  hindi ako mag-isa! :]  when i got home, i went to sleep right away [at least i tried to]. we were going to have an exam in tapdance at 7am! nyak!  saturday: i woke up at 5:30 am. feeling drowsy, i crammed two pieces of bread into my mouth and rushed back up to our room. i had to take a bath right away. i left the house at around 6:20 so i could get to school early enough to review the steps but it turns out i only got there in time. waah!! with hardly any sleep, katty, kepi, reniel and i moved forward for our turn... we passed! katty and i both got 1.75 and kepi and reniel both got 1.5!  kakaasaR!!!! nataasan pa kami ni kepi at reniel!!!! waaarrghh!!! hahaa.  after the exam, i went straight home. michael was coming over to cut my hair. it took us some time 'cause i couldn't decide how to have it cut. we ended up with having it cut the same as last time. and now, my hair is pretty short... kind of hard to manage actually. hayy,  sanayan na lang 'to.  after lunch, i accompanied lyn to sm cubao, she was going to buy rubbershoes and a bag. bardo tagged along 'cause he needed some lettering guides. it took them a long time to purchase all that they needed, for that, i reached up at around 3pm. grgrgrgr. we hung out at katty's again. allan was there! [hi allan! salamat sa pagbisita!]. apparently, kepi slept the whole day. tsktsk,  kakaawa, wala na naman kasing tulog.  we didn't do anything at all, although allan told us something... yihee. hehe. at 6, we left katty's. kepi waited with me at mcdo philcoa, where i was going to meet selena. when lyn arrived, kepi went on his way home and then we took a bus to fairview.  syet, kakahilo, aircon pa. yukk.  at ayn's house, we stayed for quite some time. they were trying to wrap up their work. we also stayed longer so we could play with her daughter tristia. she's so big now! cute!!!!!! i wanted to take her home hehe. she was giving all of us hugs and kisses, and to think she's only seen me once before.  bait talaga, ang cute pa.  so there... we left for mayrics at around 9. lyn was going to be the one to manage buzznite 'cause allan was in lucena. i was so sleepy when we got there...  grabe.  hehe. it was a good thing ayn's friend, trina was so eager to keep me awake [salamat trina!!]. she did everything she could to amuse me haha. she tried showing me a 'waterfall' of smoke. galing. then she'd talk to me and we'd discuss some stuff over a beer. bait!! :] fact: kapatid niya si barbie ng barbie's cradle. hehe. wala lang. buzznite lasted until around 1:30 or 2. hayy, sleepy... i flopped onto my bed as soon as i finished brushing my teeth.  today: i woke up at around 7:30 am. grgrgrgrgrgr. i couldn't get up so i slept again. i woke up at 10 kanina. until now i'm still feeling groggy... i'm going to manix at around 2pm later. we're going to watch the uprep at the theater later. hehe  sana 'di ako makatulog.   yun lang...     galing ng buzznite kagabi. at least halo-halo na yung mga klase ng music na pinapatugtog. :]
