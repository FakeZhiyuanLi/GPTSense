      Wow, I haven't posted in a while. Well in that case allow me to recap my Thanksgiving break. I got to level 10 in FFXI and added a spiffy new outfit and weapon. However, I still got pimp slapped several times after said achievements. I decided I'd had enough, and played Counter-Strike the rest of the weekend. On Tuesday I dropped  urlLink Mike  off at Charlotte Douglas International and on Sunday I picked him up. He mentioned something about a high school freshman girl getting it on with an 18 year old guy on the dance floor of a California club. I'm sure he'll tell you all about it.  But that's not what Thanksgiving's supposed to be about, now is it (not that I care). So now for the family-oriented Thanksgiving breakdown. My aunt, uncle, cousins came to town like they always do. My uncle is a medic in the FBI and just got back from Iraq (am I allowed to say that?). Of course he had lots of cool photos to share, including one of him sitting on Saddam's throne. Rock on. My aunt was her usual polite and quaint self. My cousins were interesting. My female cousin's superiority complex continues to blossom, as does her stomach. She's a nice girl, but both are going to be problematic for her when she grows up. My boy cousin was all dressed up like a marine when I got to my grandmother's house, which was cute.  (OMG shut up mom. No I don't want to explain what I'm typing at 11:00 at night. She doesn't know about this blog and I don't trust her judgemental self with all this personal information. But anyways, let's continue...)  He came over and spent the night. We let him shoot the painball gun and he played with the pets. He walked in on me playing CS right as I was blowing heads apart, and I promptly explained to him that this type of thing was happening in Iraq right now, hoping he'd understand. I hope I didn't disturb him too badly (God I feel like an ass). The food was pretty good. They left, and my normal weekend routine began.  I played some racquetball with my dad, which was awesome (and humbling too, since he's got a lot of gut and still managed to beat me 2 out of 3 times), went bowling with my youth group, and clicked some more mizzouse. School resumes tomorrow, AKA my 8 hour personal hell, which sux. But there's one person I'm especially looking forward to seing...  ME: So there's this girl...  READERS: *sigh* there's always a girl... this could get ugly  ME: No, no, let me explain!  1) She's humble: she acknowledges her flaws, and wants to know if she's doing something wrong or being annoying, which of course she never is. 2) She's happy: she relishes hugs, and always has a smile on her face. She has an inner warmth that is absolutely contagious. 3) ...and I think she likes me. I have my sources, ones that she specifically told not to tell me, but of course they did.  I came to watch her cheerlead for a Varsity basketball game Tuesday night. After that we went to dinner and had a blast. I got kinda sick so I actually had to leave on time, but I would have stayed hours longer if I could have. If you're reading this, I'd would really  really  like to do it again some time.  Sealed with a hug or two (or ten), JD

      My friend over at  urlLink Sordid Clouds of Sadness  pointed me to this website some time ago, and in light of his posting of his personal theme song, I decided to post mine.   urlLink       Click the picture and find out your Cowboy Bebop Themesong!    FFXI UPDATE!!!!!!!   I have achieved level seven! Woohoo!

      Mr. Bush, I'd like to introduce you to a group called the "Black Eyed Peas."  Overseas, yeah, we try to stop terrorism But we still got terrorists here livin' In the USA, the big CIA The Bloods and The Crips and the KKK But if you only have love for your own race Then you only leave space to discriminate And to discriminate only generates hate And when you hate then you're bound to get irate, yeah Badness is what you demonstrate And that's exactly how anger works and operates You gotta have love just to set it straight Take control of your mind and meditate Let your soul gravitate to the love y'all  We can't keep policing the globe like this... every day, some pissed off whacko takes a pot shot at our soldiers or blows himself up. I dunno... every day, these type of people are proving that we're not as strong as we once thought we were.

      Now that that's out of the way, let the ranting begin. First, I'd like to comment on my newfound gaming addiction. You might be familiar with it, it's only the longest goddamn series ever to grace the gaming world. That's right, it's the latest Final Fantasy, number 11 in Squaresoft's "Neverending (and totally unrelated) Story." Did you ever watch that movie as a kid? Eh... probably not.   Anyways, this game is dangerous. It needs a friggin warning label. To borrow a phrase from MacHall (a sexcellent comic if there ever was one), "Make sure to plan ahead and make sure you don't have anything you need to get done for a while... like sleep."   The graphics are really good, the commerce system is flawless, and the team play is awesome. However, (and  urlLink Mike  will no doubt disagree with me on this) the menus are a bit cumbersome, the game is slow and at times, extremely diffucult. It also includes the original online RPG dillemma: Go solo and reap the exp benefits with possibility of getting ass kicked, or kick much ass and devide up the exp.  The progress either way is just slow enough to keep your gratification level at a bare minimum, and therefore you'll find yourself thumping monsters on the head as often as is humanly possible to get your daily dose. Of course, all of this could change when I reach a higher level. I can't really speak from an expert's point of view cuz I'm still only level 6 (even after putting about 8 or 9 hours in... see what I mean?). Here's my character:  Race: Tarutaru Level: 6 Job: White Mage Weapon: Ash staff Current spells: Cure, Dia, Banish, Protectra  Sounds lame, eh? Don't worry, Thanksgiving holiday will fix that right up ;)

      So I finally succumbed to confomity and started a blog. They say these things are therapeutic, that they help you relieve stress. Well I guess we'll see. This blog will most likely consist of my conflict with my dear parents, which will probably make me sound like a spoiled ungrateful brat, but hey, I don't give a damn. To the reader this will probably just appear to be another typical teenage cry for help, a rant on random stuff that pisses me off, but it's  MY  rant. Eat that suckazzzz....

       JD was too lazy to go through and bold the names, so you´ll just have to suffer.   JD: I woke up this morning and walked topless out into the hallway  Martha:mmmmhhhhmmmmm  JD: yes, admire my one pack! I actually slept well, after I finally got to sleep. I think I mumbled something about Martha. I think her brother might have heard. I sure hope not.  Martha interrupting: u forgot to mention ur goodnight kiss...  JD: yes.... it was a good one. We sat on MarthaÂ´s bed after everyone was asleep and talked about the very bizarre conversation we had had a few hours ago. Then I kissed her goodnight. Unfortunately, I had to go back to my room...  Martha: then we ate breakfast...  JD: Zucaritas, to be exact. and apple pie. Yum. Then we went to see the neighbors and we gave them a miniature Christmas tree thingamajig. The little kid set off his toy helicopter in the house. And his car. And all his toys. Which did not help me to understand one word that was being said. Then we drove to Guadalajara.  Martha:  JD doesnt like long drives... but finally after an hour (thats soooo not long) we got to Guadalajara where we showed him house #1 and he helped us carry stuff out since we r moving out from that house...  JD: After that, MarthaÂ´s parents chucked us in a mall. We walked around for like an hour and a half. We sat down and talked about sex... AGAIN. I apologized for stumbling upon the topic. OK let me explain something. By "illegal," Martha meant dating. Being the guy, I immediately thought sex. So blame it on me. But hey. I know the law. We ate pizza, saw a lot of "cinturones de piel" (you guys might want to Babelfish that one), and I bought a cool hat that I will show you all when I return to Charlotte. Some of you might even be priveleged enough to wear it. Heh. Then they chucked us in a second mall.  Martha: JD was already crooked by then... his neck started hurting and acoording to him he looked like the hunchback of notre damme, but he didnt, he was as cute as always just with a shoulder higher than the other 1... he ate MY lime sherbert ad he threw away his vanilla ice cream... i think he only liked better mine bc i was the one spoon feeding him...  JD: I like lime sherbert!!!! Especially when cute girls feed it to me.... yummmmm.  Martha interrupting again: "yumm" the girl or the sherbert?  JD: both. we went back out to the car, I swallowed a double dose of neck pills, and we drove to house #2. It was under construction, so I just played with MarthaÂ´s pinky. Then.... the apartment. That was interesting wasnÂ´t it Martha?  Martha: yup.. and lets leave it at that...  JD: Your parents are nuts.  READERS: What the hell is that supposed to mean?  JD: That information is on a need to know basis....  READERS interrupting: wtf?! I need to know dammit!  JD: Tsk tsk, youÂ´re so nosey.  JD: Now weÂ´re back in OcotlÃ¡n. I played my iPod over her stereo while watching Jjjjoni Brrrrravo. I have big feet. Hobbit sized. Oh yeah, and Martha tried on an "ewwww" dress. I guess thatÂ´s it.  Martha: Random fact about JD: he only wears boxers when he sleeps!  JD: I feel liberated!  Martha. he is sooooo cute!!!! (OMG his orange pajamas...)  JD: and on that note, it is time for the orange pajamas to come off. Good night people!  Martha: yay! good night people...  JD: I luuvvvv uuuuuu  Martha: u know i luv u more  JD: I canÂ´t win....  FIN

      More co-blogging goodness (OMG A SPANISH KEYBOARD I´´M SO CONFUSED)  JD:  Yeah so yesterday was not a good day. I have titled it the day my body rebelled against me. My neck turned into stone, my stomach blew up, and I got carsick. We got to see the mariposas tho, and that was pretty cool. We have this really cool picture of hundreds of butterflies flying in front of the moon. It was like a 2 km walk up the mountain, and then another 2 down. So my legs died too. They went into shock and quivered like jello. And a bunch of little kids attacked the car trying to bum a ride off of us. Then we went to a restaurant and I ate Martha´s strawberries. Yeah, Martha´s turn to type.   Martha:  hello, i havent used a spanish keyboard in a long time... this 1 is my dad´s comp... i think i should take JD to Veracruz or Chiapas were there are a lot of "witch doctors" bc he has been REALLY unlucky (ESL word)... today he seems happier than yesterday tho maybe he´ll tell u about it...   JD:  I woke up this morning at a very nice hotel (with large shaving cuts that I covered with pink stuff.... but that´s not the point). I took a really long shower. And then I drank the rest of my Pepsi. Then we went to this awesome cathedral and I was like "whooooaaaaa, I´ve never been in a church this big before." We stalked the tour guide but then found out that we had to pay.... so we ran away. There were lots of shiny things.... Then we went to Martha´s cousin´s house, and it was very nice.    Martha interrupting me:  its pink!!!   JD:  Yes yes... much like your sexy pajamas..... *cough* sorry got a little carried away there. I´m a helpless guy.   Martha interrupting again:  all guys r....   JD:  yes yes and I´m proud not to be an exception!    Martha:  my aunt liked JD´s eyes!!!   JD:  score. *martha sneezed* yeah so moving on. then we drove to Ocotlán. Marco and I played a lot of Mario Kart in the car, but I gave up after the computer mopped the floor with our dead and defeated bodies. Marco, however, persisted. He lost the 150cc cup at least 20 times. I told him he needed a Gameshark. He told me I needed some guts. I shriveled up in the corner and cried myself to sleep. Heh, not really. Then we got here. Martha´s turn.   Martha:  i gave him a tour of the house, and he got to see the "bomb shelter" and the empty part of the house... then we went 4 a walk around the neighborhood... then we came back and he found a scorpion on the stairs... finally he ate something he liked... hamburgers... after he ate his hamburger he went to my room to practice his trumpet... i think he liked my backstreet boys posters that i have in that room...   JD interrupting:  that´s so not true!!!!   Martha again:  ok, not the backstreet boys just nick... and kevin.... ill let him talk now...   JD back in power:  Yeah.... I admit it. So I practiced until my lips died. Martha drew a picture of a funky munkey with excess facial hair.   Martha interrupting:  a beard   JD:  yes, a beard. Then we talked for a long time about everything from All District Band to sex. *cue music*    Martha once again:  explain to them so they dont get the wrong idea...   JD:  It all started with the thing about how she was turning 18 in February and "it" would be illegal. We determined that as lucky as I may say I am on this blog, I´m never going to  get  lucky. What a shame. But at least Martha upholds her principles, so that´s a huge plus.   THE QUOTE OF THE YEAR:  Do you want some ice cream? That I can offer you...  lol   JD:  so i ate my ice cream (well half of it) and then I watched a movie about submarines from the future.   Martha:  we all live in the yellow submarine...   JD:  well at least you do. speaking of which eleanor rigby is playing on the stereo... It was all Martha´s master plan to distract me while she washed up. It worked.   Martha:  why did u choose that title?   JD:  heheh, that´s your fault. so the movie is about 20 minutes from over and she walks in...  "Hello again.... should I tell you?" "Eh? Yeah go ahead (not knowing what to expect)" *tosses me an uninflated blue balloon* "Sorry, it´s the closest thing I could find." *much sheepish grinning and blushing* "I thought you were a good girl!"   Martha:  well i did that bc of what we had been talking about... :-P   JD:  No complaints here. Well that´s about it for my fun-filled day. Say goodnight Martha!   Martha:  goodnight to all the helpless guys that will read this blog...   JD:  Te quiero.   Martha:  yo mas, bye.

        Hola from Texcoco    JD:  Martha and I are gonna do a co-blog thing here. That's right, I'm in Mexico! Texcoco to be exact. It's a town about an hour away from Mexico City. It's in much better shape than Reynosa, the border town I stayed in last summer. There are lots of shops, a mall (with very suggestive movie posters), and plenty of crazy drivers that will turn you into street pizza if you're not careful. Yesterday was your typical travelling day. I got up at five (pleasantly surprised to find that I was no longer "down with the sickness") and drove to the airport. I was expecting total mayhem, a line of over 100 cars getting inspected b/c of the code orange that we're at right now, but was also pleasantly surprised to find only one car in front of me. Inside, the line at the Delta booth was reasonable. My dad and I located my flight and then had over an hour to eat breakfast and lounge around. It was just enough, and I got back to gate A1 right as they called my row. My connection was in Atlanta. I met my uncle who's in the FBI at the airport and he showed me to my next flight. We sat on the runway for like 45 minutes but were only 15 minutes late arriving. Hooray. I found Martha and her family, choked a little on the Mexico City air, and then we drove to dinner, then to the hospital so Mr. Sanchez could see a friend, and then to Martha's grandmother's house. Later on that evening, we went over to her uncle's house for hot chocolate. We stayed there for like 2 hours. The adults talked, and the kids played poker and Uno. I suddenly realized how tired I was from my 20 hour travel day and nearly passed out on her cousin's bed. We went home, and I went to sleep. Today I got to see the Aztecan pyramids. Walking up them was quite a chore, especially since I haven't gotten much excersise since soccer ended. But, at the top I got my reward ;) Another one for the collection! Then we came home and my brain melted cuz I watched too much TV. Which reminds me, I've had a "Spanish Headache" and a brutal crick in the neck. My body refuses to be 100% healthy. Anyways, we ate dinner and then went to get some yummy ice cream. Then Martha and I sat down and talked for a long time about everything from anorexia to annoying people. She just got out of the shower, so here she is.   Martha: hello... yay! i got my Christmas present! JD is here in mexico with me... im not that happy tho bc my parents have been really annoying... he already tell u most of what we've done up to know... oh! but he forgot to tell u about is pajamas!!! he has ORANGE pajamas... he looks soooo cute weaing them!!! oh and when he was at the airport i couldnt recognize him bc he looked like a Backstreet Boy! well not really but he looked REALLY cute... hehe... as he told u already he isn't feeling 100% fine and i've been worrying about him and stuff... he met some of my mom's side of the family...  and my cousin the one that he met is the one that "approves" my bfs so ill have to ask him later whats up... haha...  i dont know what else to write... (sorry Brian about all this stuff im writing i know u dont like to read this kind of stuff)   JD:  Yeah... the parents. Hehe, it's funny. When we're in Charlotte, we worry about my parents. When we're in Mexico, we worry about her parents. But they haven't been that bad to me well except for they used to get mad at Martha for talking to me in english b/c my  dad  (once again, parents at the root of the problem) asked Mr. Sanchez and Mrs. Junco to only talk to me in spanish, but I didn't think they'd apply that to Martha.... anyways I kept getting really frustrated that I couldn't communicate with her very well, so I explained to them and they backed off. Now she's a little bit happier but still worrying a lot about me. I'm just tired and aching all over so I'm not my usual smiley self. Tylenol has helped some, but I think a good night's sleep will do even more. Tomorrow we are going to see the butterflies that have migrated to Mexico for the winter, so I have to get up early.... bah bah bah. Now I have to go make my sandwich. Good night people. Luv ya Martha :)   Martha: People i worry about him bc he is my guy! i have a good reason to be worrying about him!!! (now he will take a shower and put on his cute pajamas....mmmmhhhmmmmmmm) Good night people... i luv u more   THE END

       2SpacedOut: The Holiday Christmas Special  *All of tonight's headers are either song lyrics or titles. See if you can name them!*  Christmas has officially arrived here on the east coast, but I'm feeling pretty... ugh.... right now. Let me explain.   Get up, come on get down with the sickness.  These few days leading up to Christmas have been quite painful for me. Ok, so after I got my car fixed and inspected, my dad took me to this restaurant called Greystone. I had been there once before and the food was mediocre at best. I remembered only one thing about the place: it takes forever and a day to get your food. The same was true for this visit, but I never expected to get  food poisoning . Not the vomiting type, but the type that will sap your energy for days and make every waking moment a painful one. Medicine hasn't really helped. In desparation, I tried some methods to ...ehem.... "clean out the system." So far, not working. I'd better heal up fast because...   Whoa, Mexico  Yup, I'm going to Guadalajara to meet Martha's family! Hooray! So, this whole crazy plan basically developed on our ROTK date. We were eating lunch when, through a mouth full of roast beef, I mentioned how unenthusiastic I was about this Christmas holiday. I explained to Martha how I was basically just going to play on the computer until my eyeballs exploded, and how bored I would become. She proposed that I come with her to Mexico for Christmas. "Yeah... I wish" was my original response, but luckily, she persisted. After several long battles with my parents, I forked over 300 bucks to pay half of the plane ticket and my one and only Christmas present: a one week trip to Mexico. Thank you priceline.com. Thank you mom and dad. Thank you Martha. Now I'm kinda their slave though... I have to practice in excess of an hour a day, read my English book, and do their bidding wherever they need me before I go. It's worth it. Oh yeah, and I  finally  got Martha a Christmas present. ^_^ I hope she likes it, but no Christmas present can do that girl justice for how she's brightened my life. Even worse, this week is "hands-off." Don't want to get caught by the father who's hosting me and paying for my meals o_0   I guess I'm a criminal.  So that hit and run thing never blew up in my face like I feared it would. I still have no remorse. I dunno though... I think my car and I can see the future. Check it out. Each of the two times I have had an accident, I have dreamed about it the night before. The first one, I envisioned myself running a red light on a rainy day and almost hitting something. After that, I tried to park my car on a lake, but it wouldn't float. I told myself, "silly JD, you can't drive a car on water." The next day, I was following my friends to a Chinese restaurant and tried to speed through a yellow light. Not realizing that my friend infront of me hadn't gone through the yellow, I had just enough time to hit the brakes. It would have worked, except for the fact that it was pouring rain. This last time, I had a dream that I was up on a mountain, with a steep gravel road and cars parked all around. I was backing out and put on the breaks, but the car just kept sliding, right into another parked car. That night I had my second accident. The similarities are just plain creepy.   American Money  In the past, I haven't been big into the "giving" part of Christmas. I'd pick out a present for my dad, and my mom would pay for it. I'd pick out a present for my mom, and my dad would pay for it. One of them would pay for the present for my aunt or grandparents, and that would be it. Then, I'd watch as they blew even more money on my Christmas wishlist. Not this year. This year, I spent my  own  money on Christmas gifts. I took time out of my day to shop for them, and I made sure that each one was quality. Together, my brother and I spent over 180 bucks on presents, and believe it or not, I actually felt better afterwards.  READERS: Only 180 bucks?!  JD: Don't get me started, rich boy.   I'm in love. I'm a believer, I couldn't leave her if I tried.  A week basically alone with Martha. Hands-off or not, I'm still gonna enjoy her company. It's better than just making a depression in my chair while Epsilonia (who is now a capable level 13) gets his ass kicked by goblins and my mom screams at me for being a lazy teenage bum. Hehe. 28 hours from now (yes, 4:00 in the morning. Damn terrorists.) I'll be arriving at Charlotte Douglas International. It'll be the first time I've flown alone, but I think I can handle it.  Feliz navidad, everyone. Now if you'll excuse me my stomach isn't very happy with me right now...  Luv ya Martha

      Today was overall a good day. I got my SAT scores back: 1330 baby, a 740 verbal and a 590 math (once again, math sucks). I woke up at Tim's house after a productive night of studying. I got to school for my 9:00 Comp Sci exam, and did pretty well. Afterwards, I hung out with a slightly grumpy Martha while she finished her AP Art exam, but she relaxed after a while. We had a pleasant lunch at Dean and Deluca, and then cuddled up for the 12:30  Return of the King . She's convinced that we broke the world record for holding hands. She gave me two awesome Christmas presents: a Sonic-blue X-Box controller ^_^ and an Old Navy fleece that looks  really  good on me. Thanks again, Martha! I really need to find her something for tomorrow... Well anyways after that I took her back to the hotel and got a kiss ^_^   After that was Emilie's birthday party at an undisclosed location (you'll see why in a sec). We had a really good time, and the food was awesome. She gave me a System of a Down CD that I'm currently listening to. We left the restaurant.... and then the day did a total 180. As Tim was heading to his car, I extended my hand for a friendly handshake... and then promptly slapped him in the face. Heh. He chased me like the ninja he is back to my car. I hopped in and cranked the engine. Totally distracted by my current mental high, Tim and Katy thumping my window, and  Fly Like An Eagle  playing on the radio.   I backed out, cautiously I might add, but not cautiously enough. Some prick was parked like 5 feet from the little concrete thingy that you're not supposed to roll your wheels over in a parking space, with his tail hanging out into the middle of the road. POW!. There goes my fucking right tail light. Despite the probably wise council of Emilie's parents, and because my blood was boiling and Tim and Katy advised me otherwise, I didn't leave my license or number. I guess I would have had the damage been serious in any way. Ask me in real life if you want the full report. I'm a teenager from a family of musicians, I can't afford to pay for this type of stuff, and tonight I refused to because the guy was incorrectly parked. My parents say that I'm the more guilty party, but I don't care. So many factors kept me from being a level headed driver at that moment in time, and I personally have been hit-and-run twice at school (causing much worse damage, by people that have shitloads of money). Whatever, I hope this thing doesn't mushroom into a world of consequences, but that could very well happen.   Life sure is a roller coaster ride isn't it?

      Well, I managed to demolish the buzz. I offended Martha by accident.... I know she said she wasn't mad at me, but if it had been anyone else she would have gone postal on them. I'm just so good at saying the stupidest shit.  Think before you speak, idiot . She didn't look that happy as I dropped her off at the hotel... It's the second time that our little communication barrier and my stupidity has gotten me in hot water. Whatever.   I get home and my dad promptly turns my ass around and tells me to go walk the dogs, because they're annoying him and my mom. I'm sorry, but you're walking around in torn shorts with no shirt on. ARE YOU FUCKING BUSY?! I don't think so. Why don't you just take care of your own damn problems instead of deffering them to your poor, helpless 17 year old son who's been studying his ass off all day long.  As you can tell, I'm quite pissed off at myself, my dad, and the world in general. I doubt there's anything rational in the above paragraph, but I just had to get that monkey (hahaha Mike, get it?) off my back.  The meteorology exam went well today, i aced that biatch. It also made me happy when Martha told me that our studying had helped her a lot too. I really love her... I just really need to watch my words if I want her to keep loving me. Maybe I'll have some more to say tonight, after I test drive "XIII." Yes, I do still play video games with all this romance, school, and turmoil in my life. Maybe we'll have some more mind-blowing philosophy. We shall see. Now, as Tucker has suggested, I'm gonna get the fuck outta here.  (my apologies to Martha and my readers for my harsh words, but hey, they had to come out some time)

      If your name is not JD, please disregard the last post. It was one of those "bizzare stress relievers for my twisted mind" type of poems. All you need to know is that now *cue James Brown* I feel good.  Let's do another rundown, shall we?   THE ENGLISH EXAM  I bombed, mostly due to my own laziness. I couldn't even answer the most basic questions, as was to be expected considering that I (once again) have not read anywhere near half of the assigned reading.   THE MATH EXAM  Ditto, except for the part about laziness. I try hard in that class, I really do... this year though, I just don't get it. Allow me to explain with the poem I wrote for extra credit (he basically gave us 6 freebie points at the end of the exam).   There once was a teacher named Bach, who's style of teaching plain rocked, But I just don't get it... I hate to admit it, But on this exam I just flopped!   OK, so the part about my teacher was totally inacurate, but a little brown-nosing was in order. I do want to graduate after all. I wish we would practice each individual concept more than once. He blazes through it in class, we stumble through the homework, and then we move on. I feared that the day of reckoning was at hand, and boy was I right. Well... fuck it.   I DON'T UNDERSTAND PEOPLE  The following rant is a must have for any blog, and I felt like I had reached a few conclusions on the matter. First there are two people that I know at my school that are afflicted with "severe fitting-in syndrome" (yeah, so I just made that name up right now). I have never seen, let's just call them X and Y, these persons' true personalities. X conforms his interests to those around him. He'll never disagree with you, and is always desperately trying to win your favor. It's repulsive. Y is much the same, he'll lie (big hint people, lying is not a good way to make a friendship grow) about different cool stuff he has, about achievements he has made in my areas of interest, just so I will like him. Come on people.... WHY CAN'T YOU BE YOURSELF? More on that later.... Then there's subject Z, a girl at my church who is so desperately attatched to the fact that "she is not cool" that it's just plain depressing to be around her. I mean, I'm happily chatting with my brother and two of his friends while playing a game of cards on this youth retreat a couple of months ago, and she just wanders in and says in a "woe is me" type of tone, "Oh, I hate my life, when will it ever end..." Dear subject Z, it's not  you  that pushes people away, it's your damn 24/7 aura of miserable depression!!!!!!  Now, heed my words of advice, all you insecure teenagers trying to find your place in the world.  The moment you stop believing in a system of cool vs. uncool, popular vs. unpopular and BE YOURSELF, your teen angst will be instantly cut in half (the other half being that of school, sex, and drugs). What I admire in a person and look for in a friend, as do most content young adults, is a confident and unique individual. What I don't like is a person who's always trying to fit in. Desparation, my good friends, is a turn off. Be confident, be an individual, and be  alive .   *phew* Wow, that really needed to be said. Moving right along...   MORE MARTHA GOODNESS  I spent tonight with my awesome girlfriend studying for meteorology. After the math exam, we went back to my house and got about half way through the semester. At 6:30, my family had to play some brass quartet pieces at church, which was a big success. Martha came and watched, and apparently, was quite charmed. Afterwards, I drove her back to Lindsey's house and we cuddled up on the couch and got through the rest of our material. We both laughed at her failed and successful attempts to make up answers on her tests, and her funky grammar. I annhialated the pop-up ads on her computer, which was easy but still got me plenty of gratitude (hooray!) including a kiss or two from Martha. I could have kissed her all night...   COME BACK DOWN TO EARTH, LOVER BOY  Meteorology exam tomorrow. While everyone else in the school is going to be panicking about physics, biology, or chemistry, Martha and I are just gonna quiz eachother for a few minutes and enjoy eachother's company :) Right now, I'm gonna get a good night's sleep, and prepare myself for a kick-ass day tomorrow.   Adios, mi gente!

      Hmmmm, I haven't posted in a few days. Well, then let me summarize what's been going on in my life since the 11th.   THE HISTORY EXAM  ...went surprisingly well. We basically managed to pry the Document Based Question out of him at the review session, so I was well prepared for that part. As for the 60 multiple choice, I guess I felt confident about them (wow, isn't that an oxymoron?). We'll see what happens... last time I felt confident about something in that class he handed me back an 'R' for Rewrite. Oh well. The next exam is AP American Lit. on monday, and I'm in a similar predicament... except there isn't a 5 hour review session to bail me out. Coupled with the fact that I haven't really read.... all.... year..... yeah...........   LESSONS AND CAROLS  ...is a music/scripture thing, as you might be able to tell by the title, that my church is doing this Saturday and Sunday. I play handbells and sing (falalalala-lala-la-la). Last night, a few boneheads didn't know where to go to sing, so that was ugly. Other than that though, not a bad performance. The second one is tonight, so maybe it'll go smoother.   MARTHA  As I promised her, we went out to lunch together on Saturday. I picked her up at 12:30 and we went to the Subway just down the street. That took about 30 minutes, and I had to be home by 2:30. Not knowing what else to do, we drove across town to South Park and just walked around the mall for a while. When we got back in the car to leave, she told me I owed her a kiss, and I happily obliged... for like 10 minutes :) After the last one, Martha looked out of the window and there was this old couple just staring at us, eyes wide and mouths hanging open. We both started laughing uncontrollably, and I hid behind the steering wheel. I dunno, Martha keeps telling me not to freak out if I don't know them, but I mean these people were like five feet away! Heheh, looking back on it it's kinda funny.   NEWS FLASH!  So Saddam's been captured? Rock on. It's about time we had a little success over there. One more reason for me not to study english ^_^   P.S. to Martha: Love is the highest form of trust ;)

      Today was the first exam for the majority of the school: foreign language. I think I did really well, despite the fact that I basically learned a whole semester's worth of vocabulary in one sitting the day before. The essay I wrote was extremely well organized and structured, one of the things that Mr. Floyd likes the most. Hopefully I can count on a 50/50 on that part.  Lucky Martha didn't have an exam today, and unlucky me didn't get to see her. But I guess that gives me at least  one  reason to look forward to tomorrow, THE AP AMERICAN HISTORY EXAM. *thunder clap* So is it a bad thing if I haven't learned diddlysquat all year? Yeah, I thought so. The five hour (no joke) review session begins in eight minutes, so I had better get my empty head over there.  luv ya, Martha ;)

      I think if you looked up "success" in next years Websters dictionary, it would say "CCDS Holiday Band Concert 2003." That's how much ass the band kicked. I mean, the program was almost  dead  a few years ago, and to start over again with a classload of freshmen(who, by the way, did manage to get their act together) and play the way we did was phenomenal. Even better, our director basically gave me a solo bow after the 2nd and 3rd pieces (logical I guess, I had the melody and no trumpet section to back me up), and the audience ate it right up. I got some  very  generous applause. Best of all, Martha was sitting in the 2nd row and saved me a seat :) So after the band had rocked the hizzouse, my girlfriend and I enjoyed the rest of the fabulous concert together. Her host family left her behind after the concert was over, which was kinda sad, considering she's been there for the whole year. But I got to stay and talk to her for an extra half hour, which was awesome of course. Hehe, as you can tell, my ego is soaring. Life is good. Unfortunately, I can count on my AP and math exams to chew up the next week and spit it out. Well, after that it's Christmas, but no Martha... I'd better enjoy these last days as much as possible :)

      Hehe, so I guess.... hehe..... *more chuckles* Wow..... Martha is incredible :)  READERS: Who is this.... Martha? ME: Well isn't it obvious? READERS: Well yeah, but we're sap mongers! ME: Martha is my girlfriend that I've kept under wraps for a while now, we talked about it and decided that it was too much trouble to always put "my girfriend or my boyfriend." READERS: You mean Martha from  urlLink Octopus' Garden ? *valley girl voice* Like, OMG! She's so cute! ME: Hehehe, yeah, I know *more stupid grins and Brian-nausea-inducing mushy goodness*  It's gotten to the point where I might want to stop being so.... descriptive.... in my blogs :) I dunno, I'll ask Martha about it and see what she thinks. On that note, let me just say that I was busy from 3:15 to 5:00, part of which was spent at Caribou, but most of it in the school parking lot *wink* Hehehe, I'm drowning in love here folks.  Maybe I ought to sober up (figuratively) before the concert. Ah yes, the concert! Well, we're gonna be laughed off the stage if the damn  freshman  don't get their act together. I'm the lone trumpet, and along with my brother and a few select other people, not to boast, but we're what's holding this band together. The saxophones are just plain volatile, and there's this one stubborn drummer who tries to be Devon from that movie drumline, a real arrogant hothead. Well, Matt and I gave them both a piece of our minds today, and for the most part, they took it well. We'll see how it turns out tonight. I'll see you there, Martha!

      Tonight was the first date I had ever been on, not just with my girlfriend, but with anyone. It was absolutely magical. It was the typical dinner and a movie date. We saw  The Last Samurai  with Tom Cruise. It was a great movie all around. It included a good story, excellent swordplay, and some nice performances (especially at the end, which is by far the most powerful scene that I have witnessed in a long time).   One makeout session and a short car ride later, we arrived at my grandparents' house (not as lame as it seems, just bear with me here). I introduced her to my grandparents, my aunt from Florida, and my uncle from Atlanta (the one who had been to Iraq) For dinner we had my grandmothers' shrimp and grits, by far the best on the planet. She had never tasted grits before, but liked them quite a bit. She had worried about her english brain locking up but she didn't have a single problem, just as I had promised her. We also watched a little TV, just flipping channels to see what was on. We played along with Jepeordy and Wheel of Fortune.  After dinner, it was time to take her home. She helped me get back to the other side of town where she is staying (my sense of direction is pitiful). She asked if she was going to get a goodnight kiss, and I couldn't even wait for her to unbuckle her seatbelt. We pulled over into a dark area of the street, and had the most incredible kissing experience. After that I met her host family for the first time, and we had a fun little conversation. As I drove home, I couldn't get the stupid grin off of my face. I'm still the luckiest guy in Charlotte, and it gets better every day :)  Not a bad first date, eh? More to come.... JD

       urlLink Brian from Psycho Genius  has informed me that I'm only going to be allowed to post this sappy material for so long before he goes insane, so I'm going to milk it for all it's worth while I still can. Today, my gf did the  sweetest  thing. She surprised me during Computer Science by posting little love notes all over the computer where i usually sit :).  READERS: How sweet! Can we read them? ME: No, that's private!!!!! You'd have to steal my wallet first...... READERS: Hmmmm...... *scheming and plotting* ME: *nervously checks over his shoulder*  Today was filled with bad Spanish tests, mind-blowing history discussions, snoozing through English class, and lots of  "ChapStick Action"  *sheepish grin* I had such a good time with my girl today, from chatting all the way through first period free to watching her do a fine job cheerleading for the basketball game, and all the in-betweens, she just helped to top the day off as a most excellent one.  On a sad note, I have SATs on Saturday. On a happy note, we're going out on our first date that night! Baby, I love you sooooo much.   Killing yourself yet Brian?  :) Hasta mañana, my faithful readers (all 5 of you).

      Chapstick has suddenly become a necessity in my life.... hehehehehehe. *JD's grin stretches from ear to ear as he realizes just how lucky of a guy he is*  Since she's such a huge Beatle fan, I thought I'd supplement my own blog with some lyrics from one of my favorite bands...  I could stay awake just to hear you breathing  Watch you smile while you are sleeping  While you´re far away dreaming  I could spend my life in this sweet surrender  I could stay lost in this moment forever  Every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure    Don´t want to close my eyes  I don´t want to fall asleep  Cause I´d miss you baby  And I don´t want to miss a thing  Cause even when I dream of you  The sweetest dream will never do  I´d still miss you baby  And I don´t want to miss a thing    Lying close to you feeling your heart beating  And I´m wondering what you´re dreaming  Wondering if it´s me you´re seeing  Then I kiss your eyes  And thank God we´re together  I just want to stay with you in this moment forever  Forever and ever   Don´t want to close my eyes  I don´t want to fall asleep  Cause I´d miss you baby  And I don´t want to miss a thing  Cause even when I dream of you  The sweetest dream will never do  I´d still miss you baby  And I don´t want to miss a thing   I don´t want to miss one smile  I don´t want to miss one kiss  I just want to be with you  Right here with you, just like this  I just want to hold you close  Feel your heart so close to mine  And just stay here in this moment  For all the rest of time   Don´t want to close my eyes  I don´t want to fall asleep  Cause I´d miss you baby  And I don´t want to miss a thing  Cause even when I dream of you  The sweetest dream will never do  I´d still miss you baby  And I don´t want to miss a thing   Don´t want to close my eyes  I don´t want to fall asleep  I don´t want to miss a thing  No matter what you say Mike, this song is still one of the greatest power ballads of all time.  AND RIGHT NOW, I'M LIVING IT.

      Today, a very special girl spoke these words to me in the middle of a long embrace:    "I won't let you go."   I couldn't be happier about the way things have turned out between us. Many thanks to my new girlfriend, nobody has made me feel so happy in a very long time. You rock! :)

      Yesterday... cannot be described in words, but I'll try. I spent almost the whole day with Martha.  12:30-> Pick her up @ the Sturgesses 1:00-> Get back home, pick up my rollerblades. Drive to freedom park and rollerblade for about an hour. 2:00-> Shopping! Finally found the Axe @ the Eckerds @ Park Rd. Shopping Center. Bought some boxers @ Old Navy. She bought a belt and some lip gloss. I've payed off about half my debt to her :) 3:30-> The movie started...  ...and played.... with a few bizarre interruptions.... for another 4 hours.  READERS: What the hell? JD: Heh. I am under strict orders to be as confusing and subtle as possible. READERS: Ok... weird...  7:35-> At the Sturgess' just a little past curfew, thanx to some Cricket Arena traffic.  READERS: wtf.... where are all the details? WE WANT SAP! JD: Sorry folks, I think you would drown in all the sap that I went through yesterday. *happy sigh*  Martha=perfection JD=helpless guy Martha+JD=melting  Now JD=giddy  Te quiero, Martha. Sorry this blog was so strange o_0

And if you call, I will answer And if you fall, I’ll pick you up And if you court this disaster I’ll point you home  You think I only think about you When we’re both in the same room You think I’m only here to witness The remains of love exhumed You think we’re here to play A game of who loves more than whom  And if you call, I will answer And if you fall, I’ll pick you up And if you court this disaster I’ll point you home

      I got one of my ONWs back today, and I nearly passed out on the floor.   J.D.- This is the best ONW you've written this year- specific/thoughtful/ and well written. Good job! Blah blah small criticizms etc...   Just yesterday I was venting my rage at the man, and today he turns our test into our class drawing a poster and hands me an  A . Upon discovering my grade,  urlLink Conner  promptly attacked me with several inanimate objects. I looked at my quarter grades as well.  Q1: B- Q2: B- Exam: A- Sem1: B  Wow. That's four whole points on my GPA with the AP added in. Rock on! I just don't know what to think about the man now. It seems that only when my thinking coincides with his that my grades go up. Or maybe I really am improving. It's too early to tell. But you haven't seen the last of *theme music*   JD MILLS, TEACHER SLAYER!   Rachel pointed out that I was a little harsh in my rant yesterday. I know I was harsh, but I'm not trying to make the man hang himself or anything. The greatest thing about blogs is that they're self-therapeutic. I just had a  lot  of hot air that I needed to let out. You also made some good points that I hadn't considered, but will keep in mind in the future.  Martha had D-Hall today, the first of two. Those things are  not  fun. I think I've had... hmmm.... maybe 3 or 4 over my highschool career, 2 of which have been on the new system. You have to sit and stare literally at the wall for an hour. You can't do anything else. Not even homework.  We got in trouble with the Sturgesses this Monday, we got there like a full 50 minutes after I had promised we would. Mrs. Sturgess sent my dad an email about curfews. He gave me a lecture, but wasn't at all mad or anything. Let's just hope it ain't one of those days for my mother when she finds out. Martha might get some of her priveleges taken away. Let's hope she can at least go to sweet 16 next week.  Luv ya Martha, good luck with everything :)  Oh yeah, and on yet another sad note, my friend Mike at Moment of Clarity has written the final chapter of his blog. Click his link on the right menu bar over there and be stunned. Just make sure your legal gaurdian or any other adults aren't around.

      My mom apparently made contact with Mr. Anderson (AKA the man who robs me of my happiness). Now she knows that I have not 15 notecards due, as I told her over the phone, but rather 30. She also knows that I blew off the overnight write. Bastard. I mean for Christ's sake, I was pleased with that paper! It did everything an overnight write was supposed to do! It answered the question and backed it up with a ton of facts. Then I get the thing back and it's marked up like the man was in a severe hangover with  the stupidest  comments. Example:  ME: The church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints is an interesting one. Mr. A:(underlining the said sentence) ???????  I'M ABOUT TO EXPLAIN YOU FUCKTARD!!!!!!!  And at the end of the paper, my favorite part.  Mr. A: JD, emergency! Please see me! JD: Uh.... no.  Now I admit I hold a good portion of the blame for all of this. I really don't think the guy likes me. He never laughs at my jokes. I mean, the first praise he gave me all year was on the exam. The man singled me out infront of the class to congradulate me on a excellent job. I laid the smackdown on the multiple choice, only missing 7 out of like 60. Tied for best in the grade. My DBQ's were both 8/9. And what does he give me for a final grade? A-. A FUCKING MINUS. Brian walks over and pulls out an A. WHAT THE FUCK?! Anyways, the man does  not  like me. Maybe he can tell that I really am just in that class for the nice juicy "AP" tag that comes along with it. Ugh, no teacher has been able to see right through me like that before. I don't like it. So... should I go see him, get all my personal flaws exposed, my ass chewed out for not giving a flip, and forced to do  another  excruciating overnight write, or take my chances with my beast of a mother? I decided I'd try the latter.  The problem is that my mom is unpredictable. I don't know why I ever told her that I had to rewrite this goddamn paper, I was probably just venting my rage. But anyways, somehow I told her. And 2 months later, she hasn't forgotten about it. I mean, she proofread the goddamn thing! Last year, in Mr. Kelly's class, a paper as  well structured and content-rich  as that one, proofread by my mom would have gotten me an A. This year, apparently, my best isn't good enough, at least when it comes to my writing. My best gets me an "R."  Dear Mr. Anderson, You can cram that R right up your superliberal utopian cheese-eating premature-balding ass! You're a cool guy. I laugh at your jokes and your impressions, your thoughts are tremendously intriguing. But if you want respect, you gotta give respect. And all I've gotten this year is the cold shoulder, if not a written slap to the face. Explain to me, oh wise one, why every teacher drools uncontrollably over every paper I write for them,  except you . If you need, oh let's say four months to think about it, that's perfect. We can just continue our little dance of discrimination and apathy until my mom blows up and my grade sinks to the darkest depths of the ocean. Now if you'll excuse me, I have 30 notecards to write. That's just perfect since I had planned to spend most of today with my girlfriend. Oh and yeah, one more thing. The Panthers are going to the superbowl. Are you trying to destroy what should have been your classes' happiest weekend in a long time? You can sure be a prick, Mr. Anderson.  Sincerely, JD

            What Is Your Battle Cry?        S kulking through the mountains, wielding a bladed baseball bat, cometh  JD ! And he gives a booming scream:    "I'm going to make tacos with your corpse!!"         Find out!  Enter username:   Are you  a girl, or  a guy ?         created by  urlLink  beatings    :  powered by  urlLink  monkeys         So that's my battle cry. I have a headache and a fever. Mellow mushroom is tasty. Prince of Persia is difficult.  Martha called tonight. She was happy but tired. We miss eachother. My underpants are in bad repair.  Tomorrow the Panthers play. They will be victorious. There will be much rejoicing. And streaking.  Moo moo moo... moo... moo. I want my money back from all the videogames I gave up on. Such as Diablo 2.  I owe Martha a lot of money. I don't like it when I owe people money.  The semester is over. I decided not to redo an overnight write like I was supposed to. I shall suffer for it. Whatever.  Mr. Anderson can be a nazi sometimes. He surprised us with 30 notecards due on Wednesday. That's like.... soon. Holy shit I'm shaking in my boots.  Bedtime.

      Procrastination finally took it's toll on me tonight. I had to whip up an entire web site  before tomorrow (the 16th) with four functioning pages. I made one about everyone's favorite Tarutaru, Epsilonia. The page is actually quite good, but don't expect me to update the "diary" portion ever again :) It was just a comp sci project. I dunno, maybe I'll mess around with it some more in the future.   urlLink Click here to see the site.   Maybe I'll rant some this weekend when I get some energy. Maybe.

      Today is day 1 of The JD Mills Experiment. Over the next few weeks, I'm going to be rethinking everything about myself.... asking myself why I think the way I do. Last night, things went horribly wrong..... ugh..... it's really hard to explain. But by the end of the school year, I'll be a changed man. I'll be different from all those other guys. I'll be worthy.

      Too much on my mind right now to be perfectly normal. I'm "twiterpated" half the time, but the rest of the time my mind is troubled. But I don't know why. Feeling a little better though. I added a new section to the sidebar (it's not your fault if u don't understand, it's an inside joke) :) I are hungry (yes Martha, in both ways).

      Remember what I said about teen angst? Yeah well my other half resurfaced today... big time.  I can feel my innocence slowly slipping away... and I'm not sure if I like it. I've always been "the good boy," but over the last few days, that hasn't been the case. All those years, spent maturing and growing, culminated today. I found a release, but now I feel guilty. There's nothing quite like the sensation of guilt... especially when your brain tolerates it but your heart does not. Fucking hormones. This is not the JD everyone knows... WTF... my mind is breaking into pieces... I'm confused.... I need to talk to Martha so I can clear my mind...  I'm just going to leave it at that.  Confused as hell, JD

      Yes yes, the big playoff game tonight. I'm back home in Charlotte.  I miss Mexico... I instantly felt so unpatriotic the moment I stepped onto that big-ass plane from Guadalajara to Atlanta. I was in a sea of Americans. America, the land of bad manners, of unhelpful people, of greed and lost values. Visit a traditional country like Mexico, and you'll see what we're missing here in the states. Everyone was so friendly. Religion was actually a driving force in society. Martha told me I would grow from this trip, and she was absolutely right. Talk about stepping outside of your comfort zone and experiencing something different.  It's only been a day and I miss her... Tomorrow I'm picking her up at the airport. Hooray! Then we're going to get some food and some Axe for me, then I'm driving her back to the Sturgess' house.  And then school.... but I think I'm about ready to go back.  I love you Martha.

      Wow, it's been a while since I've posted. Life has been.... ummm.... interesting I guess. Well it was up until today, but I'll explain that later.  Martha and I have had some ups and some downs. I practically ruined her birthday, yes, but we still managed to pull together for a  fantastic  Valentine's Day. And by fantastic I mean "holy-shit-what-a-day" fantastic. We're going stronger than we've ever been before, and it's a great feeling.  Today was... blah. Mike and I stayed up until 6:00 AM playing FFXI. Epsilonia is level 19 now, and would be 20 if he didn't keep dying so much... Well anyways at the end of it all I was back where I started before the night began. Go me. I must have drank 10 Cherry Cokes. I logged out in the middle of the game, and passed out backwards onto the futon.  This morning I woke up at 11:00. Mike and I played FFXI  again . Mom called Mike's house and told me to be home @ 2. When I got home, I stared at the wall. I don't think I had ever felt so bored in my life. I didn't really want to play anymore games, but I did anyways. Boredom led to melancholy.  And then Martha called.  I didn't get the usual jolt that I get out of seeing her name on the phone, because I knew that I had been avoiding the world all day. I knew that she knew it too. Our conversation was short but not sweet. She had been calling my cell all day, but I had just then at 3:00 or whatever it was plugged the piece of crap into the wall.  I didn't really feel like going to piano, so instead I went to Jack in the Box. Ultimate cheeseburger, curly fries, coke, oreo shake. *looks down @ stomach* Yup, it was way too much. I put gas in my car, and then I drove home.  I screwed around some more. Got even more bored. Took a shower (never fails to cheer me up, at least a little.) Got out and then checked my email...  ...and smiled.  Martha, I don't know what I used to do in my free time, but it all falls  waaaay  short of a moment spent with you. You're like a drug to my heart. I'm melting just talking about you (again). Thanks for the great e-mail, you just made something out of what would have been a very bad day :)

      I found this website, MoveOn.org, via Conner's blog. I decided that I simply had to put some of the information that I found there on this site. Hopefully this blog will open a few eyes.  Some of us juniors, myself included, will be old enough to vote in the 2004 election. When you do, don't vote republican because you're a republican, or democrat because you're a democrat. Vote because you feel the need to have your voice heard in our political system. But do not speak out of ignorance. Before you vote this coming november, there are a few things you should know about our current president.   1.  It appears that the Bush Administration has consistently misled the American public about Iraq , most significantly regarding Saddam Hussein's possession of weapons of mass destruction and his ties to al Queda and Osama bin Laden. http://www.fair.org/press-releases/beyond-niger.html    2.  The Bush Administration's regressive environmental policies have lowered cleanliness standards for our air and water while allowing utility companies (many of whom are Bush campaign contributors) to profit off of the weakened regulations. In 2002, the head of the EPA's Office of Regulatory Enforcement resigned, complaining that the agency was “fighting a White House that seems determined to weaken the rules we are trying to enforce." (CNN, Aug. 22, 2002) The Bush Record on the Environment for 2003: http://www.nrdc.org/bushrecord/2003.asp    3.  Bush is underfunding education. The President cut $200 million from his own No Child Left Behind Act, eliminating crucial educational programs for lower income children and cutting professional training for more than 20,000 teachers.   Flawed from its very foundation, No Child Left Behind is based on then-Governor Bush's late-‘90s “Texas Miracle,”—a program of standardized testing designed to increase performance and reduce dropout rates--now recognized as a scandalous failure. http://www.villagevoice.com/issues/0338/schanberg.php    4.  The Bush Administration's Patriot Act threatens our constitutional rights and civil liberties. Passed by a post 9/11 Congress, the Patriot act expands the ability of law enforcement to conduct secret searches, and engage various forms of surveillance, including internet monitoring and wiretapping. It gives the FBI access to American citizens' highly personal medical, financial, mental health, and student records without notification or permission, and allows them to investigate individuals without probable cause of a crime. Finally, it permits non-citizens to be jailed based on mere suspicion and held indefinitely in six month increments without meaningful judicial review.  http://www.aclu.org/SafeandFree/SafeandFree.cfm?ID=12126&c=207    5.  Bush's Tax Cuts only benefit the rich. Bush claimed that his tax cut would “reduce tax rates for everyone who pays income tax.” He failed to mention that this “relief” program would put half of the tax cut's dividends into the hands of our nation's wealthiest 5%, while 8.1 million citizens in the bottom half of the income bracket receive approximately $300 a year. http://www.ctj.org/html/gwbfinal.htm    6.  3.3 million jobs (93,000 in August of 2003 alone) have been lost since Bush took office--more than the last 11 Presidents combined. (Bureau of Labor Statistics, June 2001-August 2003) Meanwhile, huge corporations are paying fewer taxes than ever: http://www.cbpp.org/10-16-03tax.htm    7.  Bush is underfunding homeland security : While energetic in waging war abroad, the Bush administration has been oddly lethargic in fortifying our defenses at home. Domestic security agencies have been neglected. Police and firefighters have been denied essential resources, and muddled public strategy has only spread alarm and confusion. http://www.ppionline.org/    In other news...  Yesterday was the two month anniversary for me and Martha. It was also the day the Panthers lost the superbowl. Well, that was (almost) offset by the fact that I got to hold her for four straight hours :)  I have lots of schoolwork piling up. It's not a very good feeling.  My audition for Governor's School is this Saturday. I'm still debating whether I should go or not. It  is  a once in a lifetime opportunity, but it's also  six extra weeks of school, smack in the middle of summer.  Well, I guess I have to make it first.  FFXI is calling me. Goodnight.

      Play practice has consumed my life. I'm barely able to do my homework, and i spend 13 hours of my day at school. Not only that, but... aww hell I'm not gonna start one of those teacher slaying sessions again. But if you've heard me ranting and raving in the past few days, then take a look at the title of this post and you'll get what I was about to say. My mom left a message on her machine asking her to call so she could defend me. So far, no call. Heh, my mom can actually be cool every now and then.

      UT 2K4 continues to lag. I could work on my paper, seing as there's absolutely nothing else to do...  My dad wants to drive up to Virginia   again   to ride what's called "The Creeper." It's a bike trail that's mostly downhill. It's fun and all, I've done it before, but dammit I just spent over 12 hours in the car checking out colleges! I don't wanna drive right back where I was yesterday.  Martha's gonna try and call me late tonight. I hope she can.

      Random song/skit title. Heh. Well, let's put the colleges in order then, shall we?  1) UNC 2) Davidson 3) W&L  I really liked UNC. The whole place had a certain  alive  feeling that W&L and Davidson were lacking. The campus was big, beautiful, and up-to-date. W&L wasn't. Davidson was kinda in the middle. So I suppose the visits were all worthwhile. I found out lots of good information, but also came to a disturbing revelation that I had been protecting myself from. Computer Science is a really frickin hard major, and it involves a lot of math. Anyone who knows me knows that: A) I suck at math, and B) I am a slacker So I've been thinking..... How about a major in spanish and a minor in music? Those are the two things that I'm really good at and enjoy. Then, after I get whatever degree in those things, I could do some sort of technology job training, the type that doesn't involve the ultra-complicated-inner-workings-of-the-computer stuff. All that really ever interested me was programming and graphics (websites, photoshop, games, etc.) With a degree in spanish that would include appying it to the business world, I would be pretty appealing to any employer. I'll keep the minor in music because it's something that I love to do and that I don't want to just drop. Maybe I'll make a little extra money from it in the future. Who knows.  I want to see my girlfriend again. When she gets back I swear I'm just going to attach myself to her and never let go.  I bought UT 2004. Something's messed up w/ my Alienware. I have double the recommended RAM and a 3.06 ghz p4, and the thing still has incredibly slow load times. What gives? And the lag, as with any conquest-type FBS, is atrocious. Oh well, the game got excellent reviews. Hopefully, they'll release a patch or something that speeds it up to a comforatable level. I need to find something to do to burn up the rest of my energy.  EDIT: Oh, I know! I found this on some other guy's blog. It'll be me in a nutshell, I guess.

      It's spring break! Hooray! (not)  I'm not going anywhere special, just touring college campuses. Ugh, just the thought of everything that's ahead scares me. I already checked out the Davidson campus, and I guess it was pretty cool. At 1:30 today I'm driving up to Chapel Hill to look at UNC. From there, I'm heading  aaaaaalllll  the way up to Lexington, Virginia to check out Washington and Lee.  While everyone else is out enjoying their lives I'm sitting here infront of the computer having an anxiety attack.  Martha's in Mexico with Kaitlyn and Rachel. I wanted to go, but it wouldn't have worked with her friends there. She hasn't seen them enough anyways, and I'd just aggravate things.  We've been getting mad at eachother a lot lately.... I can't stand it.... Every time we make up I turn around and do something stupid without realizing it, or she's just in a really bad mood to begin with.  ...but I really miss her.  I need her.  I love her.  And so the time comes in my life where I don't want to grow up anymore. Why would I? New responsibilities, leaving the people you care about... I was a happy person every single day until I realized that the future was rushing towards me. I am a skydiver. Sure you're supposed to enjoy the freefall, but it's all gotta end. I'll hit the ground, stare back up at the sky, and wish I could go back there. This October, I'll be a legal adult. A hell of a lot will have changed.... more than you readers might understand right now. Senior year: just another rush of air to plummet through. I don't really have that much time left. I guess I'd better deploy my parachute.      Hmmm, I feel better after having said all that I guess. I guess I'll take my own advice and try and enjoy this week off from school.   Try.   Love, it seems like only yesterday you were just a child at play Now you're all grown up, and silently Oh how fast those moments flee Once we watched a lazy world go by Now the days seem to fly Life is brief But when it's gone Love goes on and on

      I thought of this random quotation that Mr. Kelly once said, perhaps because I just finished my 17 page history research paper (which must have taken me over ten hours to write), or perhaps someone sculpted a very large snow penis outside of his room. I just don't know.  I think I'm going to die of fatigue now.  I'm going to Linkin Park with Martha, Tucker, Joe, Emilie, and my dad tomorrow. It will most definitely r0xX0r m4h b0xX0|2s.  *passes out*

Brian Conroy is getting better. Martha is happy. Prom will r0xXoR. So, If you were planning to rain on my parade, could you please at least wait till the summer? I'm trying to finish the year on a good note. Thank you, please come again!

So instead I'll just bottle it up inside of me and cherish it. Thank you for such a great day, Martha. I'll be sleeping with a smile on my face tonight. :)  READERS: You do have a knack for the omision theory... JD: As do you for pervertedness!

      I was taking a survey for the Department of Defense targeted at people ages 16-21 about their future around 8:45 tonight. My dad cut me off half way through, so I asked if the nice survey lady could call back in 30 minutes.... but she hasn't called yet. Why does my dad have to be so damn rude like that? I felt, for the first time in a long time, that I was  important . Oh well, I guess delaying dinner by 10 minutes when my mom wasn't even home was too high of a price to pay for the woman's convenience and my happiness.   :\

      I give up. It's no use fighting anymore. I can't win, but why would I want to? What would I accomplish? I can be just as happy going with the flow, not adding even more stress to my life than I already have.  If anyone is reading this, I need your help. I need your support, not your cutdowns. I need a good laugh, not one more thing that I, or someone that I care about, has done wrong. Let's leave it at that.

      I've only got two reasons why I wouldn't want my childhood to be over: 1) Martha and 2) my friends. Given, those are huge, nay, monstrous reasons to fear the end of this year and then the next, but my dear sweet mother is convincing me more every single day that I don't belong in this house. Infact, I think she wants me to get the fuck out as soon as possible.   Tonight, she came in and picked a fight with me bc I hadn't signed up for my AP exams. I told her I just found out about them, as she had requested, today. She then began to tell me how stupid I was for waiting this late. Then she noticed I was playing video games. She told me she wasn't going to let me play them all night. I said fine, but I would like to go over to Martha's house just to hang out for a while, seeing as it was a  no homework night.  She said no, I wasn't allowed to go on dates during the weekdays. I told her that it wasn't a date, it was just hanging out. Defeated, she resorted to her usual god-damn-motherfucking-moronic-stubborn-headed argument of "I'm the parent.... so.... no!" It pisses me off so bad. Every time I whoop her ass with my kung fu lawyer-like argument skills, she resorts to the same thing over and over again. Then she started to rail on my grades again. I told her my math was a 79.4, and that the comment totally misrepresented my efforts in that class. She wouldn't listen. I told her that the C+ on my report card was really a B- in Biotech. I told her that I was working my ass off in that class, and that I had just let one lab slip. She didn't believe me. I told her that my GPA was a 3.7, and that the only reason she had to be mad at me was English. She wouldn't listen. Then she took my car keys and my cell phone away.  Well now that I can talk to Martha (it's after nine, wouldn't want to run up the cell phone bill) I'll stop fuming. Good night.

I love my girlfriend.  While I was at the Apple Store, I threw together a little something in Garage Band on the 20" iMac. I call it "Retro."  Right click and save as on the title of this post to download the file. Once again, you'll need Quicktime 6 and something like WinZip.

      12.9.2003  I think if you looked up "success" in next years Websters dictionary, it would say "CCDS Holiday Band Concert 2003." That's how much ass the band kicked. I mean, the program was almost dead a few years ago, and to start over again with a classload of freshmen(who, by the way, did manage to get their act together) and play the way we did was phenomenal. Even better, our director basically gave me a solo bow after the 2nd and 3rd pieces (logical I guess, I had the melody and no trumpet section to back me up), and the audience ate it right up. I got some very generous applause. Best of all, Martha was sitting in the 2nd row and saved me a seat :) So after the band had rocked the hizzouse, my girlfriend and I enjoyed the rest of the fabulous concert together. Her host family left her behind after the concert was over, which was kinda sad, considering she's been there for the whole year. But I got to stay and talk to her for an extra half hour, which was awesome of course. Hehe, as you can tell, my ego is soaring. Life is good. Unfortunately, I can count on my AP and math exams to chew up the next week and spit it out. Well, after that it's Christmas, but no Martha... I'd better enjoy these last days as much as possible :)   So much has changed since I made that post five months ago, and yet I find myself in the exact same position. Today was the last day of school for the seniors, and I have to admit it totally caught my dazed sinus-infected self by surprise. I wanted to say goodbye to everyone that I could, even though I'm going to graduation. I just get the feeling that I'll never see some of them again. Whelp, it's time to start getting ready for Bravo. Wish me luck.

      I want to eat my blog. It just looks that good. If any of you peeps want to add stuff to the sidebar with your new template, just gimme a holler and I'll show you how.  Oh yes, and after having read Tim's recent post, I also have something to say.  Dear teacher, whoever you are,    To many of the students at Country Day, blogs are simply a healthy manner of allowing their brain to ooze onto a page (which happens to be on the web). It's like a journal. Didn't your mommy ever tell you to write a journal? I know mine did. I remember really not wanting to. I thought it was pointless and I pitched a whiney little fit. But I realize that now that I have this blog, I am able to confront, analyze, whatever.... the stuff that is happening in my life. So don't get your panties in a bunch. Please.  Oh yeah, and when teachers and blogs get mixed together, bad things happen. Just ask Mr. Anderson.  I really should be doing math homework now. Wheeeeeee....

      Normal never felt so good.  The AP History exam is tomorrow. Even though I stayed home from school today to study for it, I still feel like there are massive gaps in my knowledge. It really doesn't concern me, though. What will happen, will happen. I'm gonna look over my notes for a few more minutes, and then call it a night.  CityFest Live is this weekend. Hehe, I hope I don't have any dreams about wrecking the car, like I did on this night one year ago (I smacked into Lauren Brantley the next day).  Well, back to work.  Te quiero, Martha. Me alegro de que estes bien y feliz. Nos vemos mañana (finalmente).  Hope that was understandable :P

      A wonderful person just saved me from getting my life and the lives of those I care about (in particular a girl) turned upside down. You know who you are, and I owe you big time. That's all I will say, and if you ask me about it, I will knock your teeth out, k? ^_^

      Martha graduates in about 12 hours. She leaves on Monday. Her family arrived today. She was glad to see them, but I'm afraid they were a little  too  glad to see her. As she put it, "they're just going to come here, put me in a box, and take me away."  The future is here. I feel optomistic about it, quite happy actually, but nevertheless it is bearing down on me. Furthur into the future, two peoples' lives will become intertwined, hopefully for the better. I have already commited myself to staying with her as long as possible, just as she has. We want to go to the same college in 2005, God willing. The best part about all this is that none of it phases me in the least. I could see myself like that.  It is now 12:00 AM, on Friday, June 4th. 3 days remain, and then all our love is put to the test.  But, I believe.

      Yup, I'm back in Charlotte.  I really enjoyed my little visit to Mexico and seeing Martha again. Every night we would tell eachother random stories as we always do until her parents yelled at her to go to bed. I (in no particular order) went to a lot of malls, bought gifts for the whole family, ate a LOT of yummy food (see All My Loving 2 posts down), drank a lot of piña coladas, swam, read, browsed the internet, fixed computers, hugged and kissed the girlfriend, went to a Chivas soccer game, rode in the car, napped, watched every existing episode of Hey Arnold, spoke lots of spanish, found out Martha is really getting a bellybutton ring, bought the ring, stole Mr. Sanchez's feng shui rock, went to a factory, tried a beer, watched traditional mexican dance and El Rey Leon, got bitten by mosquitos, got sick, impaled my foot with a big piece of broken plastic, said "pshhh" a lot and cheerleaded the girlfriend, played barrel of monkeys with earrings, took a horse and carriage tour of historical Guadalajara, saw the new house, got me a shiny new chupón, laughed a lot and cried a little. And probably a hundred other things that I'm forgetting.  I was with her 24/7 for 11 days, we slept in the same "room" every night in the apartment and right next to her at the hotel. Everything on that list above, I did with her. It was a very pleasant 11 days.  On the 10th day I was scheduled to leave Mexico. My "insider" at Delta had assured me that I would have no trouble whatsoever leaving Guadalajara, and that I might have to stay overnight in Atlanta. Big deal. But when I got to the airport, every single possible flight out of Mexico to Atlanta was full, all detours accounted for. My only option was to fly to L.A. at 6:00 PM, then to Atlanta, finally arriving in Charlotte the next day at 12:00 PM. Thanks, but no thanks. So, my mom did what she always does, she freaked out and bought me a real ticket home, putting her out of $530 bucks. Ouch! The next day I did the whole thing over again, but when it was time for me to go.... I wasn't ready. It caught me off gaurd. I turned to Martha. We hugged eachother for the longest time, it made me so happy... but after I turned around I almost started to cry... No matter how weird of a couple we say we are, no matter how much we fight, no matter what anybody else out there says or how far away we live.... life just isn't the same without her. She's got a piece of my heart. Martha will be back for Thanksgiving break though. Sigh...  Well, soccer practice has officially begun. 8:00-11:00 every day, with the Wilmington trip coming up on Monday. I have a scrimmage tomorrow but our team hasn't even touched the ball, we've just been conditioning... we'll see how it goes. Martha, will you wear that autographed jersey for me for good luck?  A special shout out to Mike on his first day as the Country Day punter!  Oh yeah, and everyone wish Martha luck tomorrow. She's getting her wisdom teeth out :P  Adios, JD
