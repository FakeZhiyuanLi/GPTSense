      "...or from him touching me..heh.. :D" A quote from the girl that I am supposedly talking to and about to go out with's away message. To be honest it has been about 2 weeks since we've seen eachother but a few days before she told me that she wanted to be with me but then she writes shit like this? Is it wrong for me to have an awkward type feeling? I dont think so. Why are you women so god damn complicated? Can't you just tell us the truth instead of making guys like me assume what you're thinking.   Doesnt seem like anyone reads this but I guess it's good for me to relieve tension.

      Ive been talking to this girl Jessica for a while now, perhaps about 3 months. It has come to the point where we both want to officially start "seeing" each other but we lack the dating experience. What I mean by this is that we have only really gone out together twice. So she has decided that she would like to wait. But she didnt tell me this until the day after that she told me that she wanted to finally make it official. This chick seems so high maintenance that it drives me crazy. Lets say that I dont respond to her on the internet for 1 minute or more she thinks I dont want to talk to her or something else is wrong.

      Ive had this blog for a while and have been working on a new template, self-teaching myself cascading style sheets. Ive decided to keep this pre-designed template provided by blogger.com. I suppose its alright...quite professional looking. I applaud whoever makes these. But my new one will be the shit.   Anyway, I was having a good day today until 3rd period and I had english. We're supposed to be a democracy right? That is the whole point of our country, the American Dream. Well, why is school have such a FASCIST system? They tell us what we have to learn and force us to learn in no matter what. If we dont we are threatened with referrals for insubordination or possibly even suspended. What the fuck is this. I hate public school, alot of teachers just dont care about their students. I know if you're a public school kid you just cant possible fathom how much better a private school like Gilman is and I'm sorry if I offend you. I think Ill stop now...please feel free to leave comments. I'll read them.
