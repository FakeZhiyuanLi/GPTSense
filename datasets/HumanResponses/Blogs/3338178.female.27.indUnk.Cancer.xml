      I have now worn my hair up for five days in a row. I will continue to do so until the yellow sheen in the  extremely overdone  streaks settles down into a nice beige. Yay.

      Hamlet has just finished streaking my hair after I achieved the perfect ash blond colour (home bleach; this means I can never see my hairdresser again as she will murder me by digging her perfectly manicured fingernails into my throath). It turned out so good I though  wow, this would look  great  with platinum streaks , and purchased a box of blond highlights. Hamlet specifically asked to do this. The alternatives were: I would do it myself. I personally found this to be the best solution, when I decided to do it. Or: My girlfriend would do it. She is a big giant klutz, and both Hamlet and I agreed this would be disastrous. And then Hamlet somehow convinced me that my right/left confusion would surely guarantee a terrible outcome, and that the best thing for all parties however vaguely involved would be to let his able hands deal with the entire mess. He has botched it fantastically. I haven't rinsed yet, but I can tell. It will look  awful , and I approximate that I am now seventy per cent platinum trash blonde, rather than the desired thirty per cent.  I can't tell Hamlet this, of course, because it would hurt his sensitive masculine pride. So I am stuck with the ugly highlights. This depresses me to no end.

       Playing: Goldfrapp -- Lovely Head   I don't know how many of those 225 days are shopping days, and neither am I  quite  aware why this suddenly popped into my head. Possibly because of the upcoming  in-law-aganza , and because this is the first year Hamlet and I will be celebrating said holiday  sans famille . This is such a huge event that I am looking forward to it, two hundred and twenty five days before the fact. I, Ophelia, hail from a tiny little family. I have, oh, nine family members, and then I am counting grandmothers, uncle and aunt by marriage, my sister's husband and my parents' cat. Hamlet has so many family members I sometimes suspect him of being Irish: His parents, who are  very old . His father is closer in age to my grandmother than to Papa; Papa is not so much older than Hamlet's  brother , in fact. The brother has a wife, and they have spawned. That brings us up to  five . Brother of Hamlet's wife has a retarded sister who lives with them and she is part of all family gatherings. Already we are never less than  seven  people at any gathering. Wife also believes in including her entire family in all of Hamlet's families get-togethers, hence we have her father (who firmly believes he is a secret agent) as well, which is  nine  counting Hamlet and me, and seven excepting us. Then there is the uncle and aunt of Hamlet. The uncle and aunt are brother and sister and live together. They are also very religious. This puzzles me, and I find it bizarre and somewhat suspect. Then there are cousins, of whom I have met two, who tend to show up. One of them is married. How many now? Fourteen? Oh, and let us not forget that these people have  family friends  who have no qualms whatsoever about showing up at family functions. We can rarely go there at all without being accosted by  seventeen  people. Christmas was much worse than that, though. We spent our first Christmas together apart. I went home to my parents', and he, poor thing, was forced to Santa for his nephew. (I am putting a stop to that next year, because I think Santa-ing is below him.) The year after that, I reluctantly came along to his parents' to partake in their celebration. My reluctancy and general skepticism toward the Happy Family Project 2002 was not entirely unfounded, as it turned out.  Now, a little about my family first: We are not big on Holidays. While perfectly willing to spend nine hours cracking crayfish with our bare hands while staring at the ocean and arguing about politics, Christmas is mostly just counting heads, shovelling food into one's mouth, exchanging presents as rapidly as humanly possible and then getting the fuck out of the family clutches and the Good Clothes, and into the comfort of one's own home and some really loose fitting trousers. The last ten years, as long as both children (sister and I) have been young adults and adults, I estimate we've on average gone through the entire thing in approximately two and a half hours per Christmas. As I sat next to Hamlet on the train bound for his childhood home in anxious anticipation of my first ever celebration of pretty much anything with somebody else's family, I asked him  how long does this normally take ? He said it would be fairly brief, and that we'd be on our way home before I knew it. Apparently, a thirteen hour Christmas party is not only perfectly normal in his deranged family, it is also a sort of  short  one. I, however, felt that I'd had my fill and then some after the first thirty minutes. We arrived last, because we are never in time for anything. We are always late, and people tend to be very pleased if we show up within an hour of the previously agreed upon time. Then there was a hugging ceremony that seemed to last about a year, but in reality only took fifteen minutes. Everyone came and hugged me --  double hugged  -- and since I am shorter than most people (and especially Hamlet's family of giants) this meant I was nearly smothered in jolly red and green Christmas sweaters twice by every person. I was feeling dizzy by the time I finally got to sit down and take off my shoes. When I had managed to remove one shoe, Hamlet's nephew came running. He is normally an adorable and quiet and well-behaved child, but when a young boy has been fed only sugar for three days, he will naturally be somewhat excited and active, and he somehow managed to knock both Hamlet and me over, which everyone else found absolutely hilarious and darling. I am not a family kind of person. Mostly because my family is not a family kind of family. Not that we hate each other -- we love each other dearly, and very rarely have conflicts, because we  mostly  stay out of each other lives and only meet occasionally. We've cleverly made sure we all live a good distance away from each other. Every time I see Papa and Maman, it's a joyous event, and we avoid bickering (which we are all so very good at every time we are forced, through some ill-conceived vacation plan or other, to spend more than two days together). Other things I am not include  huggy ,  easily charmed by out-of-control children  and  particularly interested in anyone's family history, unless it is extremely unique, which it never is .   It was all a bit too much for me, so I tore off my other shoe and strode into the livingroom with scarves, coat, purse, shopping bags full of wrapped presents and Hamlet trailing behind me like the exhaust fumes from a fighter jet; all while hissing  alcohol, now  at my boyfriend under my breath. (He would not altogether appreciate my culture shock before he spent Christmas with  my  family the following year, but then he Got It.) Since he is sweet, he immediately poured me a glass of white wine that I downed in one gulp (you see where this is going, right?). The retarded sister-in-law came hopping as much, if not more, hyped up on sugar as the nephew, and sat down next to me. She would remain next to me for the next twelve hours and forty minutes, and she would repeat everything I said at least four times.  As an example of the conversation that evening, imagine you are talking to Hamlet's brother (he has no distinctive personality, so he could be anyone, if that helps you) about Portugal, Portuguese beaches and Portuguese wine. Imagine telling him about a trip you took with your father when you were younger. Imagine trying to explain accidentally getting drunk while your father was napping. Now imagine  every sentence you say  being echoed back at you at twice the volume you just spoke, and with the last word in each sentence said twice just for kicks. Try that for  over twelve hours .  So naturally, by the time everyone else was getting ready to open presents, I was drunk as a hedgehog. Hamlet later estimated that I downed four bottles of wine and three glasses of  urlLink cognac  that evening, and I think that is one of those  conservative  estimates.  I had not been warned that my boyfriend would be acting as Father Christmas (my childhood was free of jolly old men with beards and red hats), and that this would mean I would be left alone with his cuckooclock family without my usual sense of discretion at hand. Hamlet was suddenly gone, Hamlet's brother was in the middle of some very complicated tale about a ceramic ashtray he had bought for his wife the previous summer, and I was in dire need of a pee, but was not altogether sure I could walk. I felt confused and wondered if it would be too noticable if I  crawled  to the toilet, when suddenly, there was a knock on the door. Nephew was instructed to open, and in the doorway, whom but the light of my life appeared, very poorly disguised as Father Christmas! The nephew and the sister-in-law were beside themselves with Christmas glee, the poor wee bairns. I probably appeared to be, too, as I rolled onto the floor laughing maniacally and pointing at Hamlet all decked out in red.  At that point, I was seconds away from becoming the unpleasant girl who peed on Mother-In-Law's floor during the Christmas party. Fortunately, the commotion around the children meant I could sneak away without being noticed. I peed, I threw up, I sat shaking on the floor in front of the toilet, crying and laughing at once. The nephew took three hours to open all his presents, and even then, it wasn't time to go home. I had started rummaging around the bathroom for razor blades to slit my wrists with by the time Hamlet got our coats and announced that  we'd better not miss the last train .  I never expected to be invited back, but the following year, Mother-In-Law was most offended that we spent Christmas with my family rather than attend her party -- and she has already mentioned how much she looks forward to having us over again this year. But thankfully, that won't happen. Hamlet has promised me that this Christmas, it will be just the two of us, and we will be in a place without phones or relatives, and we will be naked the entire time, in front of a roaring fire. I will still be drunk as a hedgehog, but there will be no danger of me accidentally vomiting on Hamlet's seven year old nephew. I can hardly wait.

      I am making a  blog . So much, then, for the slow-dripping introspection  urlLink greater ladies  spent their solitude on. What Ginny Woolf  really  needed, of course, was a blog. I can picture it.   I am hearing voices. I wonder if I'm going quite insane. Leonard asked me if I was coming to bed, and I pretended to be very busy with the writing. What I was really doing, of course, was reloading my friends page on  urlLink Livejournal  over and over again. These audioposts are  marvellous , but I've yet to discover how to actually make one. Oh, my paid account expires in three days. What a terrible thing it is, that I am right now without means to renew it.   I do, however, refuse to say that I am  blogging  something. I don't want to  blog  anything at all, thank you very much. I will write in my blog. I would say  I will write in my web log , but the aliteration is too much for me. I've had trouble sleeping lately ( aha! The onset of madness, no doubt ), and when I  have  slept, I've been somewhat violent -- not on purpose, mind you; all my life I have kicked in my sleep. I expected this to pass when I had to grow accustomed to sleeping next to someone else, but I haven't spent much time alone in any bed over the last nine years, and I still thrash about when I sleep uneasily, which I often do. Poor Hamlet. I hope for his sake that the other boys at his gym believes I am simply extremely feisty in bed, instead of suspecting him of being a poor sod whose girlfriend beats him up, whenever they eye his bruised shins and thighs. I do believe they eye his shins and thighs rather often, even though they all claim to be the most heterosexual people on planet Earth. He is sublime, and nobody can resist a peek at a beautiful body. He is already up, and is fussing about in the kitchen with the  urlLink French press  that only I seem to be able to figure out. He is working an early shift so that we might get in our evil SUV and whisk away to shop-shop-shop soon as he is out of work this afternoon. Then, even later, we are expecting a visitor -- a friend of mine who will stay with us for a week. It's her fifth or sixth visit to our household. She is very brave. Single, and yet willing to endure sex noises from the bedroom next to hers.  I suppose we really ought to be more considerate when we have guests, but I don't think we'd manage to. There is the bed, there is  us , and well -- he is most delicious.  (Of course, last night I got none, because by the time he got to bed, he only had three hours before he had to get up again. My life is terribly difficult, you see.)
