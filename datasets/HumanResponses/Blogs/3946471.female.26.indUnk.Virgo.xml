      I felt better today. I went to bed earlier. I then came home and took a long nap because my brother and his girlfriend are in town and&nbsp; I haven't seen them since x-mas. We will be going out tonight.   PK&nbsp;is ignoring me, I am not talking to him either. Stupid cunt, what choice words. I don't really care if he is pissed at me. That is his own sick little world where I did something awful and he is punishing me by not talking to me. Boo hoo. Freak. I didn't do shit anyway except react to him calling me crazy and yell at me. I think he is the crazy one.   I am bored. I need a haircut. I feel like I need some physical activity, but it is freakin hot outside. I could eat I guess. Hmmm, what's for dinner?

      So, I got offered assistant manager at work, probably because PR girl told bossman that I was going to quit. I know her a little better and she tells Andrew everything. She knows I am AM now, but still trys to run shit. Oh well. I am not worried about her. New girl was late again. Andrew tried to get me to work Saturday and that would have meant 2 weeks work with out a day off. I said no. Fuck him. Take and take and take. I don't care if I am the AM, I am not working 2 weeks without a day off.   So then I come home today, very exhausted. I see Scary (new nickname will be PK) out by the pool. So I turn down the music and try to talk to him. I told him that last night I woke up and thought it was time to get up. I took a shower and got ready for work and then I looked at the clock and it was 1:30am. I went back to bed of course. Anyway, I had to go back inside and do my other job's work. So I said give me a kiss. He ignored me and looked all pissed. I said what's wrong. He said I came outside acting all crazy. I have no clue, I sat in a chair and talked. How in the fuck is that crazy? Anyway, being exhausted and wanting his support and getting bitched at made me cry. And I asked what did I do to act crazy and he said, "Look at you right now, go inside, go inside NOW!" I said no, you aren't my daddy. He threw the pool cleaner near me, not at me and got out of the pool. Then called me a stupid cunt. And left the house. He came back a few minutes later and started cleaning all the clothes and shit out of the truck. Then he got back in the pool. I left. I went to a movie, by myself. I saw Bourne Supremacy. It was ok. I liked the first one better, of course. Anywho, I don't like being called names and him calling me crazy for no reason. I am exhausted and pissed. Ol PK will realize oneday that I won't put up with this shit forever, I am getting to old to live my life unhappy.   Don't feel much like flirting now, eh?

      I posted last night and it's not on here. That's nice. I am incredibly pissy. I would like to injure somebody. They are working me 7 days straight. I want a day off. I HAVE to pay my bills. Blah, blah, blah.   Our first softball game of the season is tonight. We have only practiced once. I don't really want to play softball. I will, of course. I am tired of softball. I am, again, too pissy to write. More later.

       I had a little halfie post written and I decided to erase it and smoke a lefty. I usually only smoke when Scary is here, but, alas, I am alone. I should be soaking in the tub, relaxing about now. The blog has me. Anywho, That volleyball pic is right after we lost in the first round of playoffs. Lost isn't really the word....got smashed works better. I thought I would post it instead of the real goofy, all lined up looking pissed off cuz we lost, fake smile, holding our lame ass wanna be trophy- picture. The kid picture, in his undies, is one I processed at work. Hillarious.   &nbsp;  At work, since 18 is gone, I am scheduled 7 days this week. 50 hours. Remind me, I have a second job as well right? I get pissy just thinking about it. They are all morning shifts. Wake up at 5:30am shifts. I don't like morning, except for the coffee part. Mmmm, coffee. This morning, before work, I stopped and ate. I had a big boy breakfast. An egg, 2 sausages, hashbrowns, a biscuit w/gravy, and COFFEE. I ate almost everything. Mmmm. I still don't like morning, but I will get up earlier just to go have breakfast before work. Go figure.   The new girl started and I don't have a nickname for her yet. New girl will have to work. PR girl is still working some kind of evil plan, I can figure the goal though. I play my game well at work. I know what I am doing. I don't like not know what she is up to. She maybe playing at my level. I feel equal prowless. I will be patient, far more patient than she can ever be. I will win.   I want to go out. I want to do something. I thought about having a girlie party at the house. Margarita Mayhem. Hang out for a while and then go out dancing, but the new schedule is preventing any good times for a while.   Well, time for a bath. You should see it in my bathroom. I bought this house for the bathtub. It is huge and has big ol' jets. I put my 13" tv on the vanity (a tv I have had since before there were remotes). I watch PBS or Seinfeld while bathing. I spoil myself so.  &nbsp;

      Here I sit at work, again. I have never worked a Sunday. Boring. I brought my other job's work with me. Kill two birds with one stone, eh?&nbsp; Six rolls of film got stuck in the film processor and they maybe ruined. Shit.   We did go to the Dusters game and Scary had only had 2 beers when I got there. I underestimated him. He is being very nice to me again. Maybe is starting to notice my feelings. I give him credit. He is trying. I am not the easiest to live with. I am whiney and complain.   I am behind in all house-stuff right now. I haven't paid bills in two weeks. I think only one is late. I will check. I hate when I do that. We will get slow pays on the credit. I need to call Old Navy and fix it.   Eww, I smell like photo chemicals. Oh well, I am in my softball practice clothes anyway. I am closing the store early to get to practice on time. I oked it with bossman.&nbsp; So, I am reading these peoples blogs and there are some loons out there. I mean weirder than me. Some guys have a blog just to keep up with their porn sites. Very organized, a plus I guess. There should be a whole seperate internet for porn only. There is probably as many porn sites as there are others. One of my first experiences with the internet was seeing a picture of a girl with all these vegetables sticking out of her who-who. Corn cob, I think. I don't mind porn, but for most women it is all in the mind. Men are more visual.   Well, more later, maybe.

      18 got fired, apparently she came up here and yelled at PR girl, up here at work that is. Stupid ass. She wanted to get PR girl fired and&nbsp;PR girl really got her fired. I will have to keep an eye on her (PR girl). I read her statement to the higher-ups and it was mostly about 18. Her evil plan worked and I didn't catch on until late. I know her power now. Bossman hired a new girl that starts Monday. I wanted the morning shift, but I wasn't offered it. Oh well.   There is a Dusters game tonight, local arena football league. Scary didn't tell me WE were going until yesterday and I have to work. I will show up at half-time when he is allready drunk. What a fun time, eh?   I want to flirt, I guess I am feeling pretty damn hot lately and want a little attention. I am down to the size I was when Scary and I hooked up (also when I was 19). He says I was a size smaller, and that they misprinted the label. Nice, it is so hard to compliment me that an insult leaks out. Oh well, I know he has a sickness, and I choose to stay with him, my bad. I must have a sickness too.&nbsp; If Geoff reads this again, he is an addict. Has been for years and I have discussed it with him. Again, I make my own bed.   I was wondering why girls never hit on me or if they do and I just don't notice. If I was a lesbian, I wouldn't try to hook up with manly looking women. The whole point in liking women is because they are women, right? Anyway, I am not anyway, so I guess it really doesn't matter.   I want my own store and a restaurant that sells fair food (like carnival food). I would call the restaurant Heartattack's. We would serve corndogs, turkey legs, those spiral fries (not curly fries), fried ice cream, Beirok(I know I spelled that wrong), fried pickles, cheese on a stick, sausage on a stick, candy apples, funnel cakes, elephant ears, frozen bananas, etc. I would get so fat. Mmmm, hand dipped corn dogs. It may not get better than that. Well, chili-cheese fries are number one on the list. I am starving balls. I should of eaten before work. I will rephrase that, I should have eaten CHILI-CHEESE FRIES before work.   I am all hopped up on caffine. I probably seem like a coke-head or speed freak. Oh well. I like coffee. On the way to work, I was going to Starbucks and this lady pulls out of the shopping center, across two lanes of on coming traffic. She decides she can't make it and throws it in to reverse. She then procedes to RAM the car that was waiting to pull out of the shopping center. I have never seen such stupid people.&nbsp; I drove on and got my coffee.   I just drank another coffee (that is 8 cups for the day) and my tummy is so empty that it made me feel sick. My grammar is awful. What happened to my perfect spelling and grammar? Does it all fade away in time? By the time I am 40 will I have backtracked to a 5 year old? Ah, well. I need to brush my teeth, it feels like they have tiny sweaters on.   Oh, a Toadies song is on, I will have to add Toadies to my fav music. I used to want to be a stripper. I wouldn't have the balls and what if I saw, like my uncle or something. Too weird. For the money only though. "I will treat you well, my sweet angel, so help me Jesus...Give it up to me". I still have two hours of work left. Urghhhh!   The Toadies, and Led Zepplin make me think of this guy. He told me he was falling in love with me. This was years and years ago. He was my friend. That song Tangerine, I miss him. The Cure makes me think of this other guy. Kelly. He was a little punk rock boy. He wanted me. I was young. I saw him a couple months ago, and strangely, he asked me if I still listen to The Cure. This makes me think The Cure reminds him of me too. Nice thought. I am stuck in a few people's minds or at least Kelly's.   Geez, this is boring as hell. Well, I guess I will update my profile and search more peoples' blogs.

      So we had our little meeting with the higher-ups. Now, after taking notes on everything said, they want a written statement. I don't want to do that. I don't really want to rat anyone out.&nbsp; I don't know, I guess I will make a vague statement.   Everything seems to pile up all at once. I am having to do hydro-therapy on Pookie's leg. It hurts her. I just opened the store. My husband has a girlfriend and her name is porn.&nbsp;I am stressed out and would really just like to be alone. I wonder if I will grow up and stand up for myself soon. I never want to say anything because I want to avoid fighting. It's coming though.   My mom is the greatest. She will really do anything for me.&nbsp; She helps me out so much. I don't think I could ever have enough words to thank her for all she does. I hope I can be that great of a mom.   Later, now.... I just erased a bunch of stuff I put on here. I still am sugar coating. I don't know why. Don't want anyone to really know how I feel, just hold it all in. I will have to make my feelings known with out words. Still not grown up, can't say a damn thing. Why can't I stand up to him.&nbsp; Don't want to start that fight, eh? Pussy.

      I didn't have time to post yesterday. Awhile back a lady thought her car was parked and bumped into my car at work. I had to get a rental car before work.&nbsp; Ok, today's complaint... My boss is an idiot. He relies on me to run this store, but doesn't give me credit. He acts like it is my responsibility but he won't even make me assistant manager.&nbsp; Then all this bullshit happened with the little 18 year old girl that works here. He started getting all buddy-buddy with her and she is telling him that I am not doing my work. So I decided I would do ONLY my work, not his or hers. The only other person that works with us is Punk-rock girl and she thinks this is bullshit too.&nbsp; 18 keeps telling on her too. PR girl made an appointment, higher up on the chain of command, to go and bitch. I don't really care anymore. This is the most ridiculous job ever. I would just quit, but I need health insurance. I can't find another job right now for at least the same pay. I already took a 2.33/hr pay cut just to work here. Bullshit.&nbsp; I am working right now and these dudes just came in, that come in every morning. They said the store wasn't open yesterday morning. 18 couldn't get her lazy ass out of bed. After being 2 hours late, she went home. They had to get one of the Amarillo girls to come in. Stupid bitch. She pisses me off! I can cry and flirt with the boss, but I do not respect that man. I won't give him the time.  &nbsp;  I got all excited because I had a comment on here, but it was just&nbsp;a courtesy comment. I had left one on some dude's site and he replied. More later...  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      I have, somewhat, been sugarcoating my posts. I guess I was kind of worried that someone I know may read it. I realized the hillarity (is that a word?) of this. The whole point of having this blog is so I can vent and act as stupid as I want to. So I will try to be myself, instead of the sugary ol' customer service act.  &nbsp; Anyway, I should be doing house work, but I really don't feel like it. We have softball and volleyball practice later tonight. I still need to think up something to have for dinner. I have no clue. &nbsp; I wanted to start up a business for weight loss. I used to be fat, well fatter anyway. And I lost weight. Now, you see, I am an expert on weight loss. The key to weight loss, for anyone wanting to know... is, wait... wait for it... EXERCISE!! Wow that is a big surprise huh? I don't understand these people complaining about being fat, then walking out of a store with a bag of chips and a donut. Put down the junk food and take a walk. After you are comfortable with the walking, try volleyball or tennis. Not your style? Try gardening, walk your fatass dog, get on a bike. I hate to exercise and I won't go to the gym. The trick is to fool your mind. I play team sports. I am just having fun not exercising. See. Then I walk my dogs, swim, play tennis (very badly). Speaking of, my nephew is still here and I just asked him if he wanted to go play. It has been raining this morning so I don't know if we will be able to. More later.

      So, my nephew, D, spent the night. Well the last two nights. He went to work with me at the store today. I split my shift with the new punk-rock girl. She needed more hours and I hate to work. I used 4 hours sick pay. He, D, had fun at my work. We did the photo lab and when it was really boring, he just played on the internet. He is seven and can pretty much entertain himself. Thank God.  &nbsp; Scary, nickname for my husband, just got this new PS2 game, NBA Ballers. He has been playing it non-stop. I used to like video games, but now it is use the analog for this and the trigger for that. Push A twice if you want this. It wasn't fun anymore, so I don't really play much.  &nbsp; Scary also brought home that movie "Butterfly Effect" last night. So here is my first movie review.... I liked the concept very well. I have the same notion that one slightly different move may alter the future forever. I was expecting Ashton Kutcher to be stupid, like that 70's show, but he was ok. Not anything special really. I was overall satisfied with the movie, just on the premise alone. We did not know that on the other side of the disc (the theatrical cut) that there were two alternate endings. I would like to see that too.  &nbsp; I get vacation time in January. I haven't had a real vacation since last May. May a year ago May. So I really want to go somewhere. I decided I liked cruises after the Alaska cruise. The idea that you get to travel to all these different cities while still chilling at the hotel is cool. I want to go somewhere warm on a cruise next time though. I want to hang out by the pool and on my balcony. I also want to go to Fiji sometime. Add to the list... Australia, South Africa (of course), Ireland, Amsterdam, London, Italy, Rome... I guess we could just do a European cruise. I think that is a 14 day cruise though. I only get a week vacation. Oh well.  &nbsp; Since I work at a photo lab, I am finally getting some of my pictures put on a disk so I can add them here. I am a procrastinater and it will be awhile though. &nbsp; I want to take a short trip to Dallas, to visit my brother and his woman. They just bought a house and I have not been to see him EVER since he has lived in Dallas. The catch to this is... I want to just go with my mom and leave Scary here. He won't go for this, I bet. We'll see.

      Pleasure to meet you. Let me introduce myself. I am the "Great Complainer". In reality, I have a basic faith in humanity. I try to believe that most people have qualities like myself...Empathy, kindness, good will. I, through a strange twist of events, am now working at a convience store. This work has forced me to look at people in a different light. I do not really like people anymore.  &nbsp;  3 weeks ago, an insurance adjust came to look at my house. I live in Texas and a huge hail storm demolished our town. Not really demolished, but caused millions of dollars&nbsp;in damages. I myself had two house windows, two sky-lights, my roof ruined and my vehicle smashed to hell. Anyway, this cat comes out to look at the damage and leaves our backyard gate open. I have three dogs. A full blood pitbull (smokey), a half pitbull, half lab (pookie) and the spawn of the above listed (runto). All of the dogs got out of the yard. Pookie got ran over and walked back home. She has a cut from belly to toe on one leg. Now when I say cut, I do not mean paper cut. It is so massive that it has to heal as an open wound and her muscles are hanging out and skin hanging off. My husband, Terry, found her in the garage on that day. I walked into the garage and freaked out. I have never seen anything like that before. Her whole leg was just layed open, bone and all. She is back at home, but she has the big lamp shade on her head.  &nbsp;  My husband just got home from work. He works as a kitchen dude at a local chain restraunt. We have been married 6 years. We haven't had kids, low sperm mobility, stoned sperms. Terry is a conspiracy theorist in his spare time. That just made me laugh. I intend to add some of his theories here on a regular basis.  &nbsp;  I have this strange, yearning isn't the right word...ummm addiction, no... attraction to South Africa. I want to go there and I read blogs by tons of SA people. I can't get enough. I am fascinated. It could all have to do with meeting this man on a cruise to Alaska last May. He was the casino pit manager on the ship. I had a couple chats with him. The accent, he told me about SA, I was hooked. I did&nbsp;not have any sexual connection with this guy, but I can't stop thinking about SA now. Very strange. The simplest explanation is that I am a weirdo.

      I am a little better. Work is going pretty smoothly. I was having a few problems with PR girl, but she won't be working much anymore. She is just a relief worker now.  PK and I are ok, I am still mixed up about us though. I can't deal with the spending recklessly, we will see what happens.  I took a picture of my boobs today. HAA! There were a few extra shots left on someones disposable camera, so I took a picture in the restroom. HAA! I am cracking myself up. That is not like me. I have great boobs, but I don't show them off. I try to hide them most times. Anyway, I will give it to PK. His mom is in town and we both had to work. Oh well.  Mom is appling to work with me. Weird. She is retired from a good job, and she wants to work at CrapXpress. Strange. I think she really just wants to help me out. Still weird.  The new girl, we have 2 new girls, the old new girl will be called....JLo and the new new girl....HP for harry potter. Anyway HP girl is PR girl's sister. I don't think I really like her already. She is going to be bossy. Oh well. I like JLo, she is closer to my age and has a good sense of humor. I can tell she is lonely and wants a boyfriend. She says stuff every once and a while. I like her though. Boring post.

      I know I have been slacking about writing on here. I am busy. Since I am the great complainer, I will begin. PK doesn't treat me right. I don't see how he can say he loves me and still treat me how he does. Each time he blows up at me, the easier it is for me to not like him. I am not perfect, I do things to him too. I know I probably annoy the hell out of him, well that's what he acts like anyway. I pay the bills and he pays the morgage. Well, the bills include the credit cards. He spent 700.00 on one card for softball shit and I don't know what else (this is in less than a month), then 400.00 on another card for fantasy football, THEN 1350.00 on a another card for a computer. I have to pay all this. I do not have money left over after paying the bills. I can't pay as much as he is spending. I allready have to give him one of my checks each month to pay the house payment. I am sick of this. I bring in the money and still don't get a say so in how it is spent. I am pissed about that damn computer he bought because he is getting cable modem and cable tv too. Guess who will have to pay that. I mean give me a break.  Ok, I just went and had a cup of coffee. I settled down some. I figure it like this, I am comfortable. I like my house. I love my husband. I don't want to disrupt all of this. It does get to a point, though, where I want to feel loved. This maybe my own insecurities coming out, but I want to be loved. I want to feel needed. I bitch on here a lot, because I say things that I don't say to anyone else. I don't want to stir anything up. I wonder if I really know what love is. Is this how it is for everyone? He is mad at me all the time, is that how it is? I guess I am mad at him a lot too, I just don't say anything. Don't stir it up. I am tired.  On the work front, we hired PR girl's sister because PR girl said she was going to quit. She isn't quitting though. Her sister can't cover the days we need covered. She starts tonight. I wrote up PR girl for not doing her work yesterday. She was upset and wouldn't sign the paper. Everyone has to pull their own weight. I gave mom an application. I know I can depend on her, but I don't think she really wants to work there. I guess I will take it as it comes.

      It still sucks. I thought I had the worst day yesterday, today was far worse. I am slowly slinking away. I haven't posted because I have been so freakin busy with work. I feel way to stressed. I admit that I do not handle stress well. I like to do things at my own pace and I haven't had the time to do that.  PR girl is quitting. This place sucks so bad that, so far, 5 people have quit since I have been here. To me that is quite a few considering I have only been at this location for 6 months. One guy was hired to be manager. He quit after only 4 days. Good ol Tom. I liked him. He was about 100 years old, but I liked him. He couldn't hear the machines beeping at him when they were messed up. He wasn't very computer literate either. Anyhoo, here's to Tom.  My big bitch of the day, stupid people. They want to drop off film for ONE HOUR PHOTO, right? Ok then they ask when the photos will be ready. My favorite response is ONE HOUR. Idiots. How hard is it to work a freaking gas pump? Have you ever pumped gas in your life? I can't stand this place. This is not my usual line of work. I am an office girl, I am very intellegent (I have taken a few IQ test, the only reason I believe I am intellegent.). I want to go away. I want to be able to use a freakin sick day. I have like 40 built up and I can't even use one.  Ok, enough of that for a minute. I finally got off my lazy ass and went grocery shopping. I cooked last night and I have food in the crockpot for tonight. Aren't I a good wife. I also paid some bills, cleaned a little, washed laundry, made the bed (with clean sheets!!!! LOL). I feel that I am doing a lot considering that I am working like 70 hours a week. PK is still an ass, I don't want to be around him. I don't want to hear him. I don't like him right now. The only reason I have to work two jobs is for health insurance. Why can't he get insurance? I am tired of working two jobs. I want a vacation, NOW!!!!!!  Let me think of a good thing that happened today.... um.... I made myself a sandwich instead of eating fast food for lunch. No, I there has to have been something... um... Oh, I made time to post on here I guess. That's all I got. Ooooh, I know, I made dinner and a fatass dinner. I can't wait to eat it. Mmmmm. Thanks to all my "readers" for cheering me up.
