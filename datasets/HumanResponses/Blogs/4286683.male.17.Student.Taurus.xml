       Ugh...i hate how everything is in my life...ive been all like...super depressed lately and gotten all...uncontrollable suicidal feelings again...(oh by the way that happens to me)...ugh...then i was all...like that last night and was mean to valann and all quiet when i was talking to her...but...i couldnt help it...i was already all depressed and she started saying things about me and it just made me worse...now shes mad at me and just...pushing me lower...this morning it took me forever to force myself out of bed...i just lay there wishing id die...i hate when i get like this...ugh...then me and valann were "talking"...no one was actually saying anything and i was just lying on the couch looking at the steaknives and wondering what it would be like if i turned on my webcam and stabbed myself for her...WHY DOES THIS HAPPEN TO ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...god i hate it when we argue and fight with each other...i never know what to do and she just keeps...attacking...i cant even do anything back...i dont want to do anything back...i just want everything to end...ugh...

       Yeah, I know...im blogging too much...i dont need to be told...i realize that this if my fourth blog in the last 3 days but i dont care...im doing what i want...anyway...i added some weird flashing words to the bottom of the screen and revived my old website a tiny tiny tiny tiny bit...isnt the flashing thing the most irritating thing in the world though...i made it and it even sickens me...well...i guess i didnt make it...i just stole the script from some 12 year old chinese girls blog and changed it to what i wanted...which reminds me of how much i hate how good chinese kids are at scripting...I CANT EVEN SCRIPT THAT GOOD NOW, NEVERMIND WHEN I WAS 12...and this one girl wasnt even the only one...there was a bunch of chinese girls with these skills...their blogs are all flashy and great...with things that i wouldnt even know where to start looking to copy...and then mines just plain...how exciting...ugh...no wonder the asian countries have to much technology and stuff...their kids are all freakin' geniuses while all of ours are idiots...like me...oh well...at least i know enough to steal what they've honestly made and manipulate it for my own purposes...thats what we north americans do best...

       Ugh...i miss valann...and this is turning into a really whiney blog...too bad i dont have anything more interesting to say but really...theres not much going on...ive just been keeping myself all super busy so that i dont think about her...which seems really cruel...not wanting to think about her...but not being with her really hurts a lot...anyway...none of what i say matters because who's ever going to see this other than valann...no one else knows about it...AND YOU'D BETTER NOT TELL ANYONE ELSE VALANN!!  *shakes fist*  Yeah...but the plus side of keeping yourself busy is that you get lots of stuff done and you get lots of praise from your parents...too bad all i get is words...i sure could use some sort of cash reward since i spent a ton of money on my trip to PEI and in doing stuff with valann when she was here...gas money sure adds up when you drive thousands of kilometres...anyway...ill just ramble about some other useless fact about my life...my blog may become a hit in Singapore yet...yeah...so my hair was super long because valann wanted me to grow it out long  *throws up*...  so since shes gone i got it cut and it feels all good now but the haircut cost me nine dollars...i know that that's actually super cheap for normal people...but for what i normally have to pay its highway robbery...Wayne's prices are really skyrocketing...anyway...i hope that that amused you Singaporean kids for a few minutes...if you live in Singapore you ARE a Singaporean right?...i dont want to be hurting anyones feelings here with my ignorance...someone get back to me on that okay...leave a comment or something...anyway...later...oh yeah...im going to be experimenting with colours to see what looks the best so i apologize if this looks jarring...

       Yeah, so from my first post I bet youre wondering what the hell i was talking about...who the hell is valann, and whats all this leaving, and why is he sad and how does his old website factor into all this...well...it doesnt...just getting that out of the way...okay anyway, ill tell you a little bit about stuff so that maybe you can understand.  Anyway, valann is a girl that i'm madly in love with, but she lives in PEI, while i live in Manitoba...we met on the internet and got all close and stuff and i went there and MET HER...keep in mind that im only 17 and so me going there all by myself is quite the accomplishment for me...anyway...in PEI i discovered that she was an even more wonderful girl then i had ever thought possible, increasing my already present love for her...anyway, PEI was the best experience of my life, we got all close and everything was perfect, but eventually i had to come home...dissappointments...ack...soon after however...valann came to live with me for a while...everytime im with her i fall more and more in love with her...the first time i left it was hard...but when she left today it was really unbearable...i cried whenever i was alone...and you should maybe understand that this is a very serious matter...since i never cry...the only times i ever remember crying are things to do with valann...anyway...there's a little something to maybe help you understand what im talking about if i mention things like valann...or a trip somewhere...or missing her...or that sort of thing...okay? okay...

       Yeah...you're probably just reading this because of the title right...well i've got news for you...this has nothing to do with edible panties at all...i just wanted to make sure i had your attention for this monumental occasion...THE FIRST POST OF MY BLOG EVER... *and the crowd goes wild*... anyway...i've never had a blog before but it seemed like an alright thing to do...i used to have a website and all i really used it for was to ramble about stupid crap anyway...so this seems even more perfect for me...yeah...so no one will probably ever read this anyway, so i'm just going to go and say whatever i want to say, do whatever i want to do...then again...my site was wildly popular for some reason...so maybe this will be too...hmmm...maybe ill go and redo some stuff on that old site...it was a pretty good thing while i had my attention on it...and then ill put a link in here and everything and then you can all rejoice and gaze in awe at my creation...then again...maybe i wont redo my site...that seems like the easier choice...yeah...i probably had more stuff to say but im really not feeling up to this right now...im all depressed because valann's gone and i miss her and i dont know when ill be able to see her again... *sigh* ...ugh...my grammar wasn't very good at the start but now its just downright horrible...oh well...
