      I'm playing Romancing Saga 2, which I've played for many times. Though I'm using emulator, it was originally an RPG game on Super Nintendo. I love this game so much because there's thousand of ways to complete it. What I'm trying this time is to reach 40th century in the game, and I'm in year 3258 now. Most of skills are completed, and powerful weapons and armours too. I'd like to get a dragon lance before I start attacking Wagnus, the most powerful monstor boss who's fortress is a flying castle.

      We (Muriel, Otto, Zeke, Eunice, and I) are having BBQ at Zeke's. It's second time since our (or  their , for I'm not graduating :P) graduation. I guess most of seniors are trying to seize their last moments in NDHU. Yes, it does make me sentimental. I should be leaving the campus by this time next year, and I have no idea at all about my future career.

      ha, it's summer vacation at last!!  Despite of my prediction, the first thing that I had to do when I was set free was "part-time job" If you know me, you can easily tell what I'd do at a holiday night. If you've guessed "watching movie," yeah, you are right. Tonight's choice was "Mystic River" It's a nice film, I have to tell you. I liked it very much, though it's a really sad story. It's not a simple "who's done it?" story, so don't expect "a good-looking cop investigating a murder case, and falls in love with another good-looking figure"type entertainmnent. The theme is much about emotions and mental struggles within characters. My best recommendation ;)  well, now I'm going to watch next film, "Secondhand Lions" XD

      Most of my final projects are done, and I'm done too.  I finally finished watching the film "the Pianist" I've rentaled it twice, yet I have been so occupied until tonight. It wasn't bad, but I didn't like it as I had expected to. too slow, probably.  2 more days to suffer, and it's long expected summer vacation. the first thing I'm going to do? well, nothing. I mean "nothing" I'll do nothing, and enjoy feeling of being bored.  Oh, it suddenly came up to my mind that I forgot to add something to my American Beauty sebsite. I wanted to point out that it's kind of interesting that Lester and Jane both used a word "spectacular" to describe thier lives.  Another long expected thing beside summer vacation is tomorrow's lunch. Pizza Hut!! XD

      Agent Smith in Matrix said that "the best thing of being me is that there's a lot of me." I cannot think of any advantages of being me, but I can tell that the worst thing of being me is that I am too easy. Today a guy walk into our cafe and asked for money (30 or 40 NT). He said that he was a vagabunt and hadn't eat anything for couple of days, so that he was starving. I did not believe him, but I handed him a 50 NT coin anyhow. After the guy left, my colleague said I was so stupid to do that, and that I was not helping him, but spoiling him. Though she was right, I did not care, for I though it was acceptable price to get rid of that guy.  I am always too easy to give away. Somethings I lost, I can earn them again. However, somethings are lost forever. The other bad thing of being me is that my learning always comes too late.

      I intended to wake up early, I realy did (when I say "early", it means around noon.) The fact is I've just woken up and it's 4:30 PM now. What a meaningful day...ha Though the most painful American Literature examination is over, I still got couple of more final projects to work on, and I've started none of them...great. I got part-time job later today, hope I'll get my pay today, for 5th of each month is payday, but I haven't got it. I'm not saying that my boss is stingy, he is a great guy, he really is. It's just that I haven't had any shift since the day before payday, for final exam's sake. What am I going to do with those money? mm...let me think...shopping around?  AGAIN ?

       urlLink intro   This is one of my favorite online games. It's kind of adventure game, but not tricky at all, so just relax and enjoy beautiful flash effects!!  I didn't know that google toolbar is such useful until I started this blog. It's like creating "my favorite" folder with detailed comments. I love this :D
