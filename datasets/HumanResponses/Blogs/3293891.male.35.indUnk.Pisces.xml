       It occurred to me last night that this is like having a dairy, but leaving it open for anyone on the planet to read.  However, because the Web is so full of all sorts of useful and information that's actually interesting, this will probably be overlooked, lost in the ether and because it's digital, some accident will eventually erase it (i.e. it's not permanent anyway...)  On the one hand, that sort of worries me a bit, should I bare my soul on the assumption that a: no-one will ever find this anyway! or b: It's anonymous, so who cares who reads it?  Ramble on

       As I get older and more cantankerous, I find more and more things that really get up my nose.  Things like; Bad Driving 'Reality' TV shows TV shows about TV shows TV shows about TV stars TV shows about TV Advertising!!!! Spin Doctoring and PR in general NZ/American/World Idol   So I thought that I'd invent my own little corner of cyberspace and vent my spleen. It doesn't matter if you don't read it, I'd be surprised if you could even follow some of my incoherent rantings and quite frankly, it doesn't matter...  So, here I am having just had to endure 'NZ Idol'. Every time I see or I hear or I am bombarded with 'news' about 'NZ Idol' I keep thinking one thing. 'Thou shalt not worship false idols'. Every time I see something about 'NZ Idol' on the TV news (on a different channel no less)  I feel like yelling at the TV 'NZ IDOL IS _NOT_ NEWS!!!!'. It's a completely made up, pre packaged, franchised piece of global pop culture crap that is invading the whole planet, turning us all into mindless automatons slouched in front of the omni-directional sludge pump that is TV.  The problem I have is that while these so called news broadcasts waste time, effort and resources on reporting on another stations TV shows (can anyone say cross-promotion or advertorials?) is that somewhere there is _actual_ news happening.  I really really object to the dumbing down of the news, packaging it into 'interesting' sound-bites, keeping it short and sweet so that we, the generation with an epidemic of TV induced ADD can digest it.  It is navel gazing of the worst kind. If TV continues to look to itself for news stories it will create a vicious circle and in the end TV will disappear up it's own arse in a puff of smoke.  Come to think of it, that's not such a bad thing really...  More ranting later. Cheers, Ekim
