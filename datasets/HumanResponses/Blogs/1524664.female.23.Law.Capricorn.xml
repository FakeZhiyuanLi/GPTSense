      The drive yesterday was good.  Long, but good.  Driving is relaxing for me--  I crank up my music, sing along, rock out, and have a pretty damn good time with myself.  I did, however, get pulled over for the first time yesterday.  Ironically, a day after I was telling my parents, in response to their concerns that I drive too fast, "But I've never been pulled over!"  Clearly, my good speeding karma is losing steam.  I was doing at least 80-- if not closer to 85-- on a 70 mph highway.  The cop was sitting behind a van just pulling back onto the road.  I knew he  had  to have spotted me (and yelled, "Shit!  Fuck!" just for good measure).  If I'd come maybe a minute earlier or later, he would have been busy either writing the van a ticket, or pulling someone else over.  But my timing was perfect, and not a minute later, I found myself parked on the side of the highway.  I always thought that the first time I got pulled over, I'd cry just because I would be freaked out and scared shitless.  But instead, I was just amused.  It was a novel experience, and I was kind of laughing to myself about how proud Mama &amp; Papa Lonestar would be of my  firstest  ticket  ever .  If, that is, by proud, I mean absolutely incensed.  I've been told that when I get drunk, I turn into a 60-year old retiree.  Apparently, this also happens when I get pulled over.  Think something like George's mother on  Seinfeld .  It's kind of scary.  As soon as the cop leaned down to peer inside my passenger-side window, I practically yelled, "Good moooor-ning!!!"  "Texas Highway Patrol ma'am, you've been pulled over for a speeding violation.  May I see your driver's license and insurance?"  As he looked over my license and insurance, he asked, "Where are you travelling today?"  I mustered up my Texas accent (but softened it out a bit-- don't want to sound backwater, just like a wholesome Texas girl) and said, "Law_School_City, Law_School_State!  Goin' back to law school... ironically."  This actually got a laugh out of him.  He said, "Well, I'll just write you a warning, and we'll get you back on your way."  The Retiree smiled, thanked him, and called, "Have a great day!" as he walked back to his patrol car.   Hell yeah .    You bet your ass I'm going to frame that little piece of carbon-copy paper.  Baby's first warning!  *tear*  It even inspired me to obey the speed limit for a whole half hour.

      Courtesy of  urlLink DG , STOP DROP AND ROLL if you spot anyone carrying  urlLink an almanac .  Oh wait, stop drop and roll if you're on fire.  But  call the FBI  if you see an almanacs.  Dictionaries better watch out--  they're next, man.

      I went down to Houston yesterday to see  urlLink this exhibit  at the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston.  It's in Houston because they're remodeling the MOMA in New York.  It was pretty good, although I ran out of steam about halfway through.  I'm pretty sick, so dragging myself through the last half, and then waiting for my mother to comb the gift shop took considerable effort.  Still, it was worth it.  I think what most interested me was seeing the layers of paint on Van Gogh's Starry Night.  That's just something you can't tell from the prints, how thickly the paint is layered on.  There were a lot of other great pieces (duh).  I'm also a big fan of the Fauvians, so I was a little bit tickled to learn that the name comes from what they were called when they first showed their pieces--  les fauves  (did I spell that right?) or,  The Wild Beasts .  I like it.  I didn't know that before.  . . .   Christmas was decent.  My parents are usually at each other's throats, but put on a remarkably good show this year after I threatened not to come home at all after dealing with their drama during finals.  I'm going back to the Midwest in a few days.  Nothing's going on here for New Years, so I figure I might as well party with the law school friends.  On the 2nd, I'll be going up to Michigan for 4 days to visit my dad's family *shudder*.  That is going to suck, and even going is rewarding my father for being extremely manipulative.  But it was either go and be miserable for 4 days, stay home and have my father make my entire break miserable, or not go home at all and have my parents not speak to me.  So Michigan it is.  Gaaahreat.  I have to say that I'm dreading the coming semester just a little bit.  I think our classes this semester might be substantially harder than the fall semester.  In my book, not much can get worse than my Property class, but I've  heard things  about Civ Pro and Con Law.  I guess we'll see, though.

      Yeah, I never get around to doing the  urlLink Friday Five  on Fridays.   1. Do you like to shop? Why or why not?   Love love LOVE shopping.  I'm definitely a consumer.  I love STUFF. . .  especially pretty stuff.  Unless I'm going with someone else, though, I am a power shopper on a mission.  Go into the store, load myself down with every possible thing I want to try on, try it all on at once, pay (or not), and leave-- onto the next.  Repeat for the next 6 hours.   2. What was the last thing you purchased?   urlLink Givenchy Very Irresistible .  Good stuff.   3. Do you prefer shopping online or at an actual store? Why?   It really depends on what I need.  If I buy something online, it's almost always because it's more convenient to do it that way.  Sales especially are easier to shop online.  Everything is much more organized, and you're not limited just to what's left in-stock at your local store.   4. Did you get an allowance as a child? How much was it?  $10 a week until I was in high school...  sometime during high school $200 a month I think...  it may have been less, I can't remember.   5. What was the last thing you regret purchasing?  I really tried thinking about this one, and I just can't remember.    Does food count?  I bought some artichoke dip from Whole Foods recently, and was sorely disappointed.  There's a local grocery store near the law school that makes  absolutely fabulous  artichoke and spinach dips.  Unfortunately, Whole Foods' dip is not nearly so fabulous.  Definitely regret that.

      We have been on break for a whole three days now.  One classmate reports tonight that she has already read half the hornbook for Civ Pro next semester, and that by tomorrow night, she hopes to have KeyCited all the footnoted cases.  ...speechless.

       urlLink Why all lawyers should avoid both math  and  science .  I have a feeling this goes for law students as well.  If you can't add*, avoid nuclear biology at all costs.  ----- *  And it's my general experience here that nobody can.  For instance, 8 of us go out to lunch and have a $35 bill.  Everybody throws in $8 bucks, and we can't figure out what the hell is wrong, how much people should pay, or how much everybody should get back.  Chaos ensues.  We are math  incompetent .

      1.  Drivers:  Only  one  person tail-gated me during my entire drive back home.  I was already doing 85, and thought to myself, "I bet that's a damn Texan."  I got back in the right lane, and sho' nuff, it was.  Driver of the Mistubishi SUV with Texas plates, I heart u.  Texas, land of aggressive, non-incompetent drivers. . . who dare to drive  above  the speed limit.  2.  Sky.  It sounds corny.  But in places with tall trees everywhere, you don't get 180 degrees of sky.  You get more like 20.  180 degrees of nice blue sky is good.  It's hopeful.  3.  70 degrees-- t-shirt and shorts today, baby!!  It's getting colder, but damn.  I don't mind Christmas without snow when I can walk around in  urlLink Reefs .  4.  Books.  On tap right now:  Ann Patchett,  The Magician's Assistant .  So far, much much more well-written than  Bel Canto .  5.  Doctors.  Somebody got strep throat (note to self:  at the next end-of-semester party, try not drinking from everybody else's glasses, hm . . . ).  No student health when you're on Mama Lonestar's insurance plan &amp; in town.  Just real doctors and antibiotics, yay!

      Finals are finished...  now comes the nail-biting waiting for grades.  I beat the average in my Research class by a fair number of points-- too bad it's only 1/4 of my total Legal Writing &amp; Research grade.  In other news, you may have noticed that the blog's been down for a few days.  At the 1L party the other night, one of my classmates came up to me and asked, "Do you have a blog?"  I'm not a good liar to begin with, and in my drunken state, I'm pretty sure my, ".... no?" was fairly unconvincing.  If I'd been more collected, I probably could have pulled off a dumb blonde, "Blog?  Ohmigod, like what's that?" bit, but no-- I was too wasted and caught off-guard to play dumb.  I immediately excused myself, went outside, and called  urlLink one  of the two people I'd trust enough to give a password to, and asked him to delete the entire thing right then and there.    After some investigation, it turns out that maybe the situation isn't  quite  so bad as was previously thought. . . .   but we'll see.  This may end in disaster yet.

      Mr. Maine brought over  The Godfather  box set and  Scarface  last night.  I'd never seen either (insert gasps of shock and horror here, about how I managed to go 23 years without at least seeing  The Godfather ).  At least now I've seen  The Godfather .  I don't know if I'll make it through the rest of the box set, although Mr. Maine left it here.  Well, actually, I do know:  I'm not going to make it through the rest of the box set.  I didn't  dislike  the movie, but I can definitely see how it's a guy's movie.  I might have to watch it again just to iron out a few plot points, but the beginning was  so slow .  It got infinitely better once people started dying.  Mr. Maine was at the library until 10 working on his note for law review, so while I waited I watched  The Big Lebowski .  I haven't seen that movie since I was in high school, but damn.  I need to buy the DVD.  I was dying, cracking up on my couch.  Now I'm off to the library to work on a settlement letter for legal writing.  Problem:  I forgot to get my new exam number.  This means I cannot get it until 9 AM Monday, when my professor's assistant's office opens up.  Our letter is due 9 AM Monday.  Damnit.  I hate to lose points on something so stupid as being late.  Note to self:  Get shit together.

      Is this worth the trouble?  I was supposed to have dinner with The Pharmacist last night.  He was picking me up at 7:30.  He called at 3:40 to cancel.  He had a staff meeting that he totally forgot about, he said, but what was I doing later this weekend?  I'm not ready to waste one of my thurs/fri/sat nights on this guy yet.  "We have a huge project due on Monday," I said.  "This weekend is really bad for me.  Let me look at what I have going on this week and call you back."  "Yeah, give me a call later this weekend," he said.  Two Points: 1.  A staff meeting?  Outside of normal working hours?  That you forgot about until 3:40 PM on the day of our date?  And you didn't realize at any time earlier this week that you had it?  ...  uh huh.  This is me being skeptical.  2.  Truth be told, I wasn't exactly disappointed.  My friends were going out and now I could go with them.  This made my night a little easier, as I'd been trying all afternoon to figure out how to meet up with them later, sans date.      I called the usual suspects, jumped in the shower, threw on clothes, make-up, and was walking out the door to meet friends for dinner when the Pharmacist called  again .  I took one look at my caller ID and sent it to voicemail.  His message:  "Hey AB, if you get this message in the next few minutes, give me a call back."  Uh, yeah.  Will do.  Pff.  I might give him a call later this weekend.  We'll see.

      Here's an example of how law school has changed me...  I was trying on pants yesterday at The Gap when I raked my thumb across a metal staple holding the label to the back of the pants.  I looked at my thumb, and sure enough-- bleeding.  Relatively certain that The Gap didn't want me getting blood on their clothes, I asked the girl working the dressing rooms if she had a paper towel.  She reappeared several minutes later with alcohol swabs and band-aids.  While I stood there bandaging myself up, she asked me to explain how it happened.  I showed her the metal staples on the tag, and she said, "Somebody stapled that on?  They are  not  supposed to do that.  A couple of weeks ago, some girl gashed her leg open on one of our sensors*."  Now, here I am bleeding profusely, and my first thought isn't, "Damn, I hope I don't exsanguinate all over the floor," or "Damn, this hurts."  It was, " Damn, she really  shouldn't  be telling me that. "    -- *those big plastic things they put on clothes to make sure you don't walk out of the store without paying.

      I referenced this in an earlier post, but I thought it deserved its own spotlight:   urlLink The Brick Testament .  It's the Bible...  done in Lego.  A friend of mine was  dying  in crim law, clicking through Genesis.  My personal favorite thusfar is Exodus, what with the slavery, killing, and plagues.  Check it out, you'll laugh...  or at least wonder who in the hell has so much time on their hands.

      I was on my way to the library yesterday when a friend called.  "Come watch basketball," he said.  Damn my weak will, it doesn't matter what time of the day it is, when beer calls, BEER CALLS.  11:30 in the AM, I walked into JP Field's and had the first beer of the day.  Hey, it's 5 o'clock somewhere, right?  We really only went there to watch the UNC game, but ended up staying for Duke and Texas (fucking OSU motherfuckers).  It only hit me that I'd spent ALL DAY at a bar when I walked out into the cold night air seven hours later.  My judgment appears to be somewhat lacking this semester.  In an instance of serendipity, I ran into Mr. Maine on our way out the door.  I met him Thursday night--  definitely one of the best-looking 2Ls.  He later told Florida that he wants to take me out for coffee and...  ask me to the law school formal ???  Damn, boy, we only talked for 15 minutes!  Yes, I was laying down the flirt, per usual, but...  damn .    I'm turning into Elaine from Seinfeld.  Mr. Maine:  totally hot.  But very metrosexual.  Metrosexuality in itself doesn't bother me;  I dig the metrosexuals.  What does bother me are flouncing hands.  Are you tyrannosaurus rex?  No?  Are you gay, then?  No?  Then stop with the flouncy-hands.   Maybe he was just drunk .  Flouncing + hot coffee = dangerous for all parties involved.  I had a date with the Pharmacist tonight, but I rescheduled to Wednesday.  Why?  There is half an inch of ice on my car, and all kinds of nastiness going on outside.  My first Texan instinct was to horde food and gasoline.  My second instinct was, "I am  not  going out in this shit tonight."  This only goes to show how much of a wimp I am:  It's not like I was driving.  Pharm was going to pick me up and take me basically two blocks from my apartment.  As far as I'm concerned, though, he can do that on Wednesday when the weather isn't so sucktastic.  [As a sidenote, I was very impressed by the Pharmacist's choice of locale for first dateage.  Very classy.]  The Boy, as evidenced by the link in the last post, is (unbelievably) still speaking to me.  This is simply amazing as, according to Soup, "A real man would have told you to go get fucked."  In a way, it makes sense that he's still friendly.  Aside from his inherently political nature, people who play games usually assume that everybody else is doing the same thing.  My outburst is simply like moving a pawn or a rook.  It's only one move among many.  This has a distinct disadvantage for me, though, which is that The Boy-- my frustration and dismay aside-- still has me hooked, and will continue to have me hooked indefinitely.  There's also the question of, given what I know about The Boy and other women, does any of that apply to me?  From a conversation a few months ago, about a girl who was dicking The Boy around:  "I have three options:  1)  Keep on course and change nothing;  2)  Ask her how she feels;  or 3) Start ignoring her and see how she reacts."  A few days later:  "I think she needs to be ignored for awhile.  It will allow her to reflect upon whether she wants the attention or she doesn't."  The Boy doesn't make it easy to walk away.  I can't say I'm exactly sad about that.

         Last night, with Christina Aguilera's "Fighter" and "Can't Hold Us Down" blaring on repeat in the background   Florida :  Angry girl music, mm?  Me :  You missed the Tori Amos and Sarah McLachlan phase earlier this afternoon.    I effectively ended things with The Boy.  It's been a week since anything happened.  He totally ignored me yesterday, and my frustration peaked.  I sat in the library, staring at the same page in my Civ Pro book for three hours.  I forced my way through one case, and then read the note following the case:  " Helicopteros  was the first case in which the Supreme Court acknowledged and adopted the distinction between 'general jurisdiction' and 'specific jurisdiction,' although it first was articulated almost twenty years earlier."    I thought, with some surprise, "I'm supposed to have been reading about specific versus general jurisdiction??"  That's when I slammed my book shut and went home.  Sitting in the library, I felt like crying, and a couple of times had to blink back the tears.  I  really  like The Boy, and I'm disappointed by the way things went down.  By the time I got home, I was just seething with anger.  No particular reason for the transition, but I'll take anger over sadness anytime.  Sometimes all you need is a little good ol' fashioned rage to get you through.  I put up an away message to the effect, "You've made your point, so...  fuck it.  I'm done."  It's okay if he's not into me, but I'm not going to let myself be toyed with indefinitely.  Sitting in the library, unable to focus-- that's absolutely ridiculous, and it had to stop.  At some point, there has to be closure, and yesterday was that point.    The Boy IMed me, "AB, what's wrong?"  In  true  girl fashion, I answered, "Nothing."  He copied and pasted my away message, and said, "That doesn't sound like a happy camper to me."  "Well, yeah."  I mean, there's really no way of disputing that.    "What's wrong, peach?"  I love that The Boy calls me peach.  "I don't want to talk about it.  I just need a few hours to burn off some frustration, drink heavily, and move on," I said.  "Is there anything I can do to help, besides allowing you to booze yourself silly?  Always a good fix to any problem, btw."  "Boozing is a fine way to cope, I'll have you know," I said.  "I was being serious."  We switched subjects, and then the conversation died.  I put on my Angry Girl Music(tm), and did what I always do when I'm stewing:  I cleaned.    Half-way through my bathroom, I made the decision to say something to The Boy.  I knew that it had 99% chance of quashing the possibility of anything, but...  to know that nothing will happen is better than spending my days wondering if he's going to be hot or cold today, feeling frustrated and upset.  I consulted my friend Soup first to ask if saying what I wanted to say was going to make me a classic psycho hosebeast.  I figured that the obvious answer was a resounding yes, but Soup disagreed, and said, "The phrasing is perfectly acceptable.  It puts him on notice that you're sick of the mind games."    I still was going to chicken out.  This really is the stuff disasters are made of.  IM is a  horrible  medium for certain types of communication.  And when you know in advance, "Man, I'm probably going to wish I hadn't said this in two weeks," that increases the likelihood that you shouldn't, in fact, say what you want to say.  However, after I told Soup I was scared, he pulled out the big guns and said, "Cowboy up, dammit!"    I'm a Texan, and telling me to stop being such a pussy, to suck it up, not to be a wimp, etc.-- all have absolutely no effect on me.  But, tell me to cowboy up, and well, there's really only one thing to do.  So I IMed The Boy:  "Hey, there is actually something you can do for me."  "What's that?" he asked.  "Next time I might need walking to my car, don't...  because I like you too much not to care."  [The circumstances of our last encounter-- leaving a bar where we'd been watching a basketball game, he walked me to my car.]  Two minutes passed.  And then The Boy blew me out of the water by saying, "I'm not sure how to respond, but ok."  So that's that.  It's over and done with.  I actually feel kind of good about that.  Yes, I am disapointed that things happened the way they did, especially given how much I like The Boy.  Yes, I could have played his games indefinitely, and maybe eventually in the distant future, something would have developed.  But now I've got closure.  Although I wish that The Boy were into me, and would take some affirmative action after my having put out there that I care, I'm pretty sure he won't do a thing, which means...  it's  done .  Just knowing that takes a huge burden off my shoulders.  ... and then, true to form, I went boozing.

      Per M's comment to the last post...  Mike:  So how long do I wait to call?  Trent: A day.  Mike: Tomorrow.  Sue: Tomorrow, then a day.  Trent: Yeah.  Mike: So two days?  Trent: Yeah, I guess you could call it that, two days.  Sue: Definitely, two days is like industry standard.  Trent: You know I used to wait two days to call anybody, but now it's like everyone in town waits two days. So I think three days is kind of money. What do you think?  Sue: Yeah, but two's enough not to look anxious.  Trent: But I think three days is kind of money. You know because you...  Mike: Yeah, but you know what, mabey I'll wait 3 weeks. How's that? And tell her I was cleaning out my wallet and I just happened to run into her number.  Charles: Then ask her where you met her.  Mike: Yeah, I'll ask her where I met her. I don't remember. What does she look like? And then I'll asked if we fucked. Is that... would that be... T, would that be the money?  Trent: You know what. Ha ha ha Mike, laugh all you want but if you call too soon you might scare off a nice baby who's ready to party.  Mike: Well how long are you guys gonna wait to call your babies?  Trent, Sue: Six days.

      The Pharmacist left me a voicemail earlier this afternoon.  He wants to take me out for sushi tonight.  I can't believe he called the next day.  Isn't that a breach of unspoken male-female etiquette?  I know we girls always bitch about guys taking their sweet time to call back, but...  I always suspect a guy of being a closet unsavory type if he calls the very next day.    I thought getting a number was like getting a gun:  there's a mandatory 3-day waiting period.  I'm not going.  I'm more hungover than I thought and I have too much to do tonight.  Plus, I'm not accepting a date for tonight  today .  I don't care if you're busy later this week.  Book in advance, buddy.

       what we dranking, we dranking it all we gon' do it till we can't or we fall last call!   Good times last night.  A small group of us went to a part of downtown that I hadn't been to before.  The first club we went to was disappointing.  I'd heard good things about it, but it was too...  lacking in sexy.  Pale orange walls topped off by a ceiling way too high.  I felt like I was sitting in a bowl of orange jell-o.  Or in a daycare center, which frankly, is not the way you wanna feel when you're out for a night of debauchery.  Find me the den of iniquity, not the daycare center!  This place might be suitable for a PG-rated girls' night out, but otherwise utterly devoid of sexy, debauchery, philander, or any other redeeming quality.  Second club was much better, and  finally  a place here that plays the music I love to dance to.  Everybody else here seems to be into techno.  I. Hate. Techno.  Hate hate hate.  If it's not clear:  I do not heart techno.  I hate dancing to techno even more.  I was never a little raver-baby waving glo-sticks around.  I love a solid beat that shakes the entire building, something I can really move to.  Dancing to good rap is something I haven't done since I left Austin (one of my favorite memories:  Sean's fingers on my skin as the two of us moved together to 50 Cent.  Damn that boy could dance), and it's something I genuinely miss.  I really think I'd like this city a lot better if there were somewhere we could regularly go booty-dance after beering up at other bars.  I met my first non-law school boy at the second club.  A pharmacist, and so much cuter than that sounds.  One of the most frustrating things about law school is that we're so insulated.  It's nearly  impossible  to meet anybody on "The Outside."  We've been going out three nights a week pretty consistently, and yet-- I can count on one hand the number of times I've talked to a non-law school guy.  This is the first one that I didn't walk away from in a matter of seconds.    The Pharmacist pulled me in by my scarf, and we danced for what seemed like forever before he grabbed my hand and led me over to a couch.  I gave the Pharmacist my number, and...  I hope he calls.  I was definitely on last night, truly laying down the flirt, but...  I kinda clicked with him.  It's generally my policy not to give my number to guys I meet in bars because it can only lead to bad things;  usually, I tell them I'll be right back, and then I disappear into the crowd, not to be seen again.  I wanted the Pharmacist to have my number.  The guys I was there with howled as I wrote my number down on a napkin.  I just grinned.  The third club we went to was between the first two in terms of atmosphere.  Lots of deep reds, which I always like.  A 2L that I'd flirted with one night last semester was there.  Florida  led me over to him and got the two of us talking again, which I was excited about at first.  This guy is only kinda cute, but he dresses well, and I was a little interested.  Except it turns out that he's a  total asshole .  WHOOPS!  When I met him last semester, he bought Florida and I shots, we talked for awhile, and then I drifted off to hang with friends.  When we were leaving, I went over to say goodbye to him, and he tried to get me to come with him and his friends to the casinos.  I explained that I had an 8:30 AM meeting with my Writing professor, I was tired, and I didn't want to go.  He started getting  really  aggressive about it, to the point of really turning me off.  Florida walked up, and he started telling her to convince me to go with him.  I leaned over to Florida and said in a low voice, "He's cute, but mean."  Florida promptly turned to the 2L and yelled, "My friend says you're cute but you're mean!"  "Huh??"  He hadn't heard.  She raised her voice even more and yelled slowly, "She says you're CUTE... but MEAN!"  I laughed, and we started walking out.  He grabbed my hand, and as I looked back at him, said, "Cute but mean?"  I smiled, laughed, told him, "Cute...  but mean," and left.  I didn't see him again until last night.  I revise my assessment to, "Cute and GO THE HELL AWAY."  Or-- Cute, but insufferable.  Cute, but with a total attitude problem.  Cute, but I can't deal with talking to you for more than 3 minutes at a time because you're fucking obnoxious.  God.  I hope I don't see that kid again.  Good riddance.  After the third club closed, we went back to a friend's, ate pizza and talked (okay, gossiped) until 6.  It felt  so  good to crawl to finally crawl my bed.  I wish I'd slept more than four hours, but at least I'm not too hungover.

      I didn't know this until a few months ago, despite my years of semi-professional (okay, not-so-professional) pizza eating:  Reheat your pizza on a cookie sheet in the oven.  The crust will be crunchy, as opposed to the sogginess you get from microwaving.

      Check out  urlLink what happened  to  urlLink A Girl Named Bob .  I would vomit.  Continuously.  For days on end.  And then I would kick ass and take names, but not necessarily in that order.  We read an article about a similar incident in Torts.  A couple was sharing a Hershey's bar until one of them got a mouthful of maggots.  When they complained to Hershey's, the company offered them coupons.  When they sued, the couple was given a hefty award that I think was at least in the hundreds of thousands.

      Because I'm getting a little tired of shaving my legs every few days in anticipation of our next little rendezvous.  Frustration with The Boy is mounting, and we're not entirely sure this isn't just the way he wants it.  The situation is compounded by the following factors: 1.  The Boy likely doesn't know how much I like him or for how long I've had my eye on him.  He probably thinks this is a recent development given the time we spent together over finals.  He would be wrong.  2.  The Boy himself assigned me the role of his GalPal.  Toward the end of finals, it was near-torture, listening to him talk about this girl or that girl, and pretending to be eager to be his Dear Abby.  Eventually, I just began opting out of these conversations by telling him that our MOs were completely different:  Whereas I'm on the happy-go-lucky side when it comes to dating, he is a strategizer and analyzes everything.  3.  The Boy likes to play games.  Among my friends, there are several working theories, not all of them particularly pleasant:  a.  The Boy enjoys manipulating people for the sake of manipulation. b.  The Boy is afraid of rejection or, alternatively, afraid in general. c.  The Boy is ambivalent. d.  The Boy enjoys the chase too much, and creates it where it might otherwise be too brief. e.  The Boy works in absence.  Which is me extrapolating from all those hours reading Derrida over the past few years.  That is to say, through the act of taking notice, absence is in fact a type of presence.  The Boy doesn't call, and he is on my mind infinitely more than had he called. f.  A combination of the above factors.  I like The Boy, and I trust him in a really fucked up way.  I trust that if he wants more than friendship, he'll do what's necessary to take it to the next level;  if he wants only friendship, I trust that he'll do what's necessary to keep our friendship intact.  At the same time, I don't entirely trust that he's not out to play me all the same.  4.  The Dear Abbying-advice-asking stopped when I, ah, spent the night at his house.  This is positive in that I no longer have to listen to what he's doing about so-and-so.  The downside is that I no longer have any idea what he's doing about so-and-so.  It's a no-win situation.  On the one hand, I wonder what the hell he's up to.  On the other hand, to ask, "So how are things with XYZ?" is almost certain to put me back in Friendsville.  Feh!  I'm going back to bed, damnit. -- *  Also known as Sunday Morning Fuckstration.

      It's Sunday morning, and I've been awake since 4:30.  I went to bed at 12:30.  Why I am awake and can't go back to sleep is beyond me.  The rest of my day is going to be so screwed up because of this.  So Walmart's been locking its workers in at night.  See the New York Times article  urlLink here.   I read something about this over a year ago-- maybe on the NYT site--and nobody believed me when I mentioned it.  Everybody scoffed at the outrageousness of the idea, telling me I must have misunderstood something.   Guess not .  In other news, this is absolutely ludicrous:  Subway has introduced  urlLink low carb wraps .  Luckily for them, they aren't touting them as healthy (bacon?  cheese?  how could they not be healthy??), but they are touting them as "Atkins friendly," and the implication is clear:  get your  500-calorie , low-carb wrap, and be healthy!  Healthy and  insanely obese .  I wish I remembered specifically what I learned last spring in one of my Psych classes about the Atkins diet.  The gist of it was that the Atkins diet is crap, and anybody who understands the way the body metabolizes and uses energy should understand this.  Unfortunately, I don't remember anymore detail than, "Atkins = crap," which isn't an especially scientific or convincing analysis.  At any rate, I keep seeing commercials for these wraps, and each time I want to yell at my TV, "Are you fucking kidding me??"

      Last night was a success.  I was in  truly  rare form.  My last non-fuzzy memory is of chugging beers at a friend's around 10:30, but highlights of the night include:  making out with two of my girl friends;  flashing one of my more reserved friends (reaction:  "Did she just flash me??");  waking up this morning with a stranger's cell phone on my desk (a peek through the phone book, and I was pretty sure he's not a law student), but thankfully no owner of the cell phone in my bed;  doing way too many shots when, after being asked if I wanted to do shots, I responded, "I really shouldn't do whiskey shots...  Bring me the tequila!";  and apparently a solid effort at drunk dialing, if the outgoing call log on my cell is any indication.  We had a really fun night, but then getting shitty with friends is always a good time.  I think I was still drunk when I went to Civ Pro this morning, hmm.  The bar we went to is  dead  on Thursday nights (though really packed on Friday and Saturday nights).  It was nice, though--  we had the bar to ourselves.  About 40 people showed up, and after talking to us for awhile, the owner said he'd give us drink specials on Thursday nights if we came back.  He even comped a lot of our drinks, which was cool.  We'll definitely be back.  I liked this place already, but this is true incentive.  A couple people are out tonight, but I lost my steam after Happy Hour.  I just felt too exhausted to even think about going out.  I made macaroni &amp; cheese, sat on the couch, and watched TV.  It's been a nice, quiet night.

      Today's Lesson Learned:  never ever sit through another Civ Pro class hungover.  Except for tomorrow.  But after that, stop this silliness.  Today was bad for a lot of people-- we got our Contracts grades back five minutes before Civ Pro started.  One friend, upon seeing his grade, slammed his laptop shut, marched out of Crim, and didn't show up for Civ Pro.  I know of at least two friends who were crying during Civ Pro, one of whom had to leave the room for fifteen minutes so she could collect herself.    After class, she started crying again, so she and I went to the girls bathroom just so she could get away from the flow of people coming in and out of the Civ Pro classroom.  I had to leave to go to Legal Writing, but when I found out it was cancelled, I returned to the bathroom to find that she'd locked herself in a stall, and was just balling.  I asked if she wanted to get out of the law school-- just go anywhere-- so we went to  urlLink Jimmy Johns  for lunch*.  Half a box of Kleenex later, she perked up.  I know she's upset, but I think she needed to get that first cry out of her system and really collect herself.  One of the hardest things sometimes about being at the law school is that when you  really  could use a hole to crawl into, there's nowhere to go.  There is no escape, and you don't want to show vulnerability in front of the masses (some of whom you absolutely can't stand) and their prying eyes.  Unless you physically leave the building, there is nowhere to hide.  I can't wait until we all have our grades back and things quiet down again.  My father says that things will get ultra-competitive, now that everybody has an idea of where they stand.  People will want to keep their rank, others will want to claw their way up.  I guess we'll see.  I just hate seeing the people I care about so devastated...  Let's skip ahead to February, when everybody will have all their grades, and hopefully things will chill a little bit.  -- *  Bootlegger club,  so good .

      Driving to school one morning, I found myself stopped at a light behind the most pathetic, rusted-out, beat-up, 1970s-era Caprice.  It was missing paint, the bumper was rusted out and hanging down at an angle, and it looked like several windows might have been replaced with saran wrap and duck tape.    On the bumper was a sticker that said in bright yellow letting, " Don't be fooled by my car-- my reward is in Heaven. "  That kept me laughing for the rest of the day.  Oh, sweet irony.  I guess God's hangin on to the keys to the Porsche for awhile, huh?

      I can't do anything without showering.  I can't get dressed, I can't leave my apartment. . .  which is why, unable to go back to sleep, I dragged myself into my bathroom at 8:30 this morning to get my hungover ass clean.  This is where I ran into a problem-- namely that, when I turned hot water handle, nothing happened.  No water came out at all.  Turning the cold water handle resulted in cold water, and lots of it.  Another twist of the hot water handle and...  nothing.  I went to my sink, silently cursing at the apartment management for turning off the hot water without posting notices, and turned the hot water knob there, expecting nothing.  Instead, I got a nice gush of hot water.  So I went back to my shower, but damnit it wasn't going to give up hot water for anything!  I called the apartment manager's emergency pager.  When she called me back, I explained the situation, and she said that she would have maintenance out shortly to unclog my showerhead.  I tried to explain that the showerhead clearly wasn't clogged--it had cold water coming out of it-- the problem was that there was no hot water.  She assured me that my showerhead was, in fact, clogged.  The maintenance guy dicked around in my bathroom for all of 5 minutes, and came back out to the living room to report the following:  1.  My showerhead was not, in fact, clogged.  2.  What  is  clogged is the hot water pipe running  to  the shower.  3.  This pipe runs from the sink, under my pretty tile floor, and up the wall to the shower.  4.  Unclogging this pipe will require either (and possibly both):      (a)  Busting through the wall behind the shower (currently our beloved linen closet);  or      (b)  Ripping up the pretty floor tile.  5.  Most likely, the earliest the apartment manager will be able to get a plumber out here to do all of this busting up and down will be Monday.  6.  This is likely to be a job of several days, as they will have to repair whatever damage they do to the linen closet and tile floor.  7.  Until they finish, I will not have any hot water in my shower.  8.  She'll probably call me in 1/2 an hour to let me know when they'll have the plumber out.      (a)  This was four or five hours ago.  So I can't shower.  Which means I can't do anything.  Compounding this problem is the sheer inconvenience of showering now.  Yes, we have a 3-bedroom, 3-bath apartment.  The major problem is that the other two bathrooms are attached to my roommates' bedrooms.  So to shower, I have to go into their rooms.  Pain in the ass.  Not to mention that I'm just a little bit worried about the apparent construction project that will soon be taking place in my bathroom.  I like my bathroom tile!  It's pretty!  It even MATCHES my shower curtain!  Or, alternatively, the shower curtain matches the tile, I guess.  Ugh.  So now I'm sitting here, skanky as ever, waiting for my roommates to wake up (it's a typical hungover Saturday here) so I can finally shower.  I wonder how long it would take to fill up my bathtub from the sink?

      I figured out that what I most dread about classes starting up is that I have no idea what the expectations of the professors are.  Which means I have to start briefing cases again.  I stopped about 1/2-way or 2/3rds of the way through the fall semester.  I didn't realize until yesterday how much I abhor briefing.  But you don't really wanna get caught with your pants down on the first day (or week) of class.  One of our professors hasn't even ordered books yet.  Another professor told us to pick up a syllabus from the school's copy office, and be prepared to discuss Assignment 1 on the first day of class.  However, the copy office claims that her assistant took the syllabus back, and told them that the professor would hand it out on the first day of class.  Which does very little for my ability to read the first assignment.  I also really don't feel like being in class again.  My break was very unbreaklike.  I did too much driving, slept on too many couches, and didn't get nearly enough sleep.    Plans for this weekend:  Read some, drink lots.

      In lieu of a real post, a collection of answers to various past  urlLink Friday Fives ....   Laying on your back and facing the ceiling, which side of the bed do you sleep on?  The right side.   Do you have to have covers (blankets and/or sheets) at all costs, no matter the weather?  Absolutely.  I get too cold at some point, otherwise.   Sleep nekkid or no? Why?  No.  Just never got into it, even living by myself.  Plus, it's too cold when you have to get out of bed.   What's under your bed?  Dust and a yoga mat/block/straps.   If you have pets, do you let them sleep with you? Why or why not?  Yes-- have to keep Lonestar Gato from bothering the roommates if I go to bed before they do.  He likes to sleep on the rug more than the bed, though.   What's on top of your refrigerator?  24-pack of Dasani, cannister of Lipton powdered tea, and someone's jug of Gatorade.   What's your favorite meal of the day?  The real question is, what am I eating?  I like good food any time, day or night. However, on school days my favorite meal is probably lunch.  The food is boring, but I eat with my friends.  It's something to look forward to, and a way to relax and blow off steam.   Name five things in your refrigerator  Fat Tire, Miller High Life, Stag, blackberry wine, Reisling.  Alternatively, we could go with solids: Whipped cream cheese, grated orange peels, spaghetti, carrot cake, package of salmon dated December 2 (not mine!!)   Name five things in your freezer.  Push pops, frozen pizza, Fire and Ice http://www.barnonedrinks.com/tips/dictionary/f.html, rum, gumbo leftovers   Name five things under your kitchen sink.  Dishwashing detergent, Dial soap refiller, mopping solution, Lysol, Raid   Name five things around your computer.  Right now:  Couch, Jergen's body lotion, highlighter, Michel Faber's The Crimson Petal and the White, new textbooks.   What was the last book you read? Did you enjoy it?  Technically the last book that I finished was  urlLink The Magician's Assistant , by Ann Patchett.  I enjoyed it, and thought it was much more well-written than  urlLink Bel Canto , but I was disappointed by the ending.  I wanted more substance and more of a punch for an end, and it just seemed to drift off.  I'm currently reading  urlLink The Crimson Petal and the White .  Explicit, but thus far very well-written.   What's your favorite book of all time?  Atlas Shrugged.   What's the worst book you've ever read?   It's rare that I read a book so bad it could qualify as "worst book ever read."  Most writing is just mediocre, not awful.  I did particularly hate Heart of Darkness, though I can't remember why. Candace Bushnell's  urlLink 4 Blondes  was so bad, I couldn't get past the 20th page or so.   What book that you've read would you most like to see adapted into a movie?   I don't think most of the books I really like would make for good movies, but maybe I don't have the necessary cinematic vision.   urlLink Handling Sin  might be a good choice.    What did you have for dinner last night?   Spaghetti and meatballs;  garlic bread;  caesar salad;  carrot cake;  rocky road ice cream;  pinot noir;  Fat Tire.   Do you ever get up for a midnight snack?   Never.   What's your favorite dessert?   Cheese cake, though I don't eat dessert very often.  I'm too picky-- don't like a lot of things.   If you were to go to a movie this weekend, which one would you pick?  Stuck on You.   What movie would you like to rent this weekend?   Scarface.  Scar Face?  Whatever.  I have  never  seen this movie, except for ONE part, which I keep seeing over and over and over purely by coincidence-- the part where he first meets Michelle Pfeifer.   What one TV show do you always try to watch?    urlLink Alias . i heart u, sidney bristow!!   What was your biggest accomplishment this year?  (Technically, 2003) Graduating from college?  Finishing my first semester of law school?  Not passing out during my Property final?   What was your biggest disappointment?   "Hell is...  other people."   Will you be making any New Year's resolutions?  Nope.  I'm not much of a capital "R" Resolution maker in the first place.   What do you have your browser start page set to?  Blank page.   What are your favorite news sites?  New York Times.   Favorite search engine?   Google and Yahoo.   What cologne or perfume do you wear?  I have an assortment that I wear:  Clinique Happy, Alfred Sung Shi, Givenchy Very Irrestistible, Banana Republic something or another, Estee Lauder Pleasures, and Clinique Heart.   What cologne or perfume do you like best on the opposite sex?  I am a fan of the Polo Sport.  There's a Chanel cologne I like, but I can't remember what it is.   What one smell can you not stomach?  Rotting food.   What smell do you like that others might consider weird?  Books.

      My writing professor told us that we should have a theme for our briefs.  I have decided that any of the following might be an appropriate theme for mine:    A.  If you can't learn to do something well, learn to enjoy doing it poorly. B.  The harder you try, the dumber you'll look. C.  Never underestimate the power of stupid people in large groups.  Or, alternatively, me by myself. D.  If at first you don't succeed, failure may be your style. E.  Mediocrity:  It takes a lot less time, and most people won't notice the diffference until it's too late.    (All  urlLink unabashedly stolen )

      On repeat today:  "When I Look to The Sky," Train.  Alternating with the Gipsy Kings' cover of "Hotel California."  Last night was only moderately productive.  I left the library at 4:30, came home, and slept.  There just comes a point in the day where I'm incapable of coherent thought without more sleep.  On today's agenda: *  Write statement of facts. *  Finish/refine my motivation arguments. *  Edit for length.  My arguments section is, at this point, about a page too long.  Something's gotta go.  That's going to be a real problem.  I'm thinking there might just be some truly ugly string cites in this bad boy.  Something tells me I may not be watching the Oscars tonight.  Oh well.  I'm gonna try to get this done before then, but it's just really slow going.  Ideally, I would like to slip the brief under my professor's door tonight  Oral arguments are on Tuesday, and then I'm DONE with the Closed Brief.  I think we can pick up the Open Brief assignment on Thursday and-- guess how I'm planning on spending my Spring Break?  Doing the Open Brief research and outlining my classes.  Same thing I did for our Fall Break.  My parents offered to fly me home, but I declined.  I really want to be able to get this research out of the way when I don't also have to deal with my regular workload.  In theory, I could get it done in Dallas at the SMU Law Library, but I'd prefer to use a library I'm familiar with.  Plus, there's no way I'll be able to work as efficiently, both for researching and outlining, either:  A)  in a library I'm not familiar with or; B) at home.  Spring Break also brings up another amazing point:  We are halfway through the semester.  Our exams start the last week of April.  This is absolutely incredible.  How in the hell are we already halfway through the semester?  Last semester went by so quickly, but it seems like this semester has been slipping by even faster, if that's possible.  Back to work.

      ... for drunk dials.  10:35 PM, the first drunk dial of the night arrives.  It's  urlLink dwb , and although I'm not sure that he's drunk, it's a general rule that anyone who calls me from DC on a Saturday night usually is.  Additionally, his message is, "You're not there?  BYE BYE!"  Very Cookie Monster, that dwb.  But hey-- at least he has a bad-ass new lamp from Ikea.  Keep rocking, and make sure to call back after a few more drinks.

      So clearly I am not seeing Mr. Maine anymore.  However, he left both  The Godfather  boxset and  Scarface  at my place.  I have to give them back, right?  It's been several weeks, and he hasn't said anything.    I'd feel guilty keeping them, though.  Also, I'm sure it's not like he has forgotten that he left them here.  I know he left them here on purpose so he'd have an excuse to come back and  make out with me  watch them.  I'm sure, however, that he intended on taking them home at some point.  What guy would willingly give up  The Godfather  boxset?

I don't fuckin' care! It don't matter to Jesus.  You're not foolin' me, man. You might fool the fucks in the league office, but you don't fool Jesus." -Jesus Quintana  -- God I love The Big Lebowski.  I must buy this movie.  Immediately.  Frodo took his copy back and now I am deprived.  We quote it  all  the time at school.  Outsiders must be baffled...  or  extremely scared .

      It's a sad Saturday when your alarm goes off, and you think, "Man, I really wish I could sleep in," but what you  actually  mean is, "Man, I really wish I could sleep until 8 instead of getting up at 7:30."  My 10:30A meeting with Prof. Writing went fairly well.  The brief, it turns out, is not the disaster and mockery I'd previously thought.  After reviewing it, he asked, "So, you've been working on this all week, huh?"  I laughed and said, "I don't think I should answer that question."  When he asked why not, I said, "Because I did everything but the introduction last night."  Yup, I do what I can to destroy my professors' impressions of me as a diligent student.  That being said, it's almost 2 PM, and I'm starting to feel pretty good about this little baby.  I am not, however, feeling pretty good about Word crashing sporadically.  I don't know what's up with that, only that it's crashed 3 times so far.  I have auto-save on, and fortunately it hasn't caused much of a problem.  It's mostly just been a pain in the ass.    Back to work:  there is potential of not being here until all hours tonight.  Mmmm, going home...

      You may be pleased to know that while I can't write a trial brief for shit, I am the queen of  urlLink Snood .  That having been said, yes, I am at the library.  At 10 o'clock on a Friday night*.  It's quiet, oh so quiet.  Except for The Darkness wailing in my earphones, but-- whatev.    I have a meeting with Professor Writing at 10:30 tomorrow morning to review my brief before I turn in the final draft Monday morning.  I have a feeling that I will, sadly, be spending tomorrow night here, too...  that is, if I haven't collapsed with exhaustion by then.  This is all okay, though.  We have a margarita lunch (perhaps a margarita Civ Pro) planned for Thursday, and then 40-Hands on Friday (yes, Soup, really 32-Hands).  I personally plan to be puking.  -- *Let this serve as a warning to all Pre-Ls.  "You think you know, but you have no idea."

Attendees are responsible for bringing their own beer (and their own buckets if they foresee pukeage).  -- *40-Hands:  A Texas Import, apparently unheard of by all my friends up here.  You duck tape 40-oz beers to both your hands.  Clearly, you can't do anything until you finish your beers.  It's a good way to get ridiculously wasted.  Drink heavily, puke some, pass out.  All in all, a good time.

      Wow.  Last night's season finale of The Bachelorette was the biggest  urlLink fantra-fest  I have been party to in a  long  time.  It was a veritable cornucopia of fantrocity.  It peaked at the end with Ian saying, "I'm scared, baby," and using, "Will you?" as his marriage proposal.  And asking Meredith to marry him  without ever having told her that he loves her .  That's not just fantrastic, that's fucked up.  You know how Saturday Night Live occasionally does "Fun with Real Audio"?  I totally see them setting the audio from Ian's lines last night to a cartoon porno.  Not to mention, I can't  believe  she chose Ian.  Wow, baby girl, you just made a HUGE mistake.  Yeah, he's hot, but that guy is so stiff, so frozen, and couldn't even tell her he loved her before  proposing .  I give it a month,  tops .  On the other hand, there is no way she could have been happy with the other guy, constantly wondering what might have happened had she chosen Ian.  Hopefully our neighbors didn't mind five girls periodically screaming, "Aaaaah!!!!   Oh...my.... GOD  !!"  If they did, they should have come joined the fantra-fest.  We had pizza, brownies, spinach dip, artichoke dip, chips, more brownies, beer, twizzlers, and wine to supplement the fantra.  Good times.

      I went to the grocery store last night for comfort food.  I've since decided that I might have odd tastes.  I returned with:  Spring rolls. Spinach dip + bread for dipping. Thai Chicken pizza. Portabella Mushroom Alfredo sauce. Ben & Jerry's Cherry Garcia (the most normal thing on the list, I think).  I had the spring rolls + spinach dip for dinner.  SO GOOD. I was pissed about the ice cream-- the local grocery store usually carries Hagen Daas Mango Ice Cream, which is absolutely fantabulous, but last night  didn't have any .  I almost  urlLink flipped out and wailed on a guitar , but managed, in the end, to keep my cool and get Ben &amp; Jerry's instead.

      I almost laughed out loud when The Boy said, "But I don't want this to end our friendship."  I made it through lunch and legal writing, and even managed to get out of the building, before I cried.  "I don't want this to end our friendship."   Wow .  I can't believe I warranted a, "I still want to be friends" comment.  I'm still in a slight state of shock over that single comment.  The last week of September, I told my best girl friend at the time, Pablo, that I was interested in The Boy.  Yes,  September .  And I'd been sitting on it for at least a week at that point.  I've liked this guy for, ah,  awhile .  I also told her, however, "I don't think I'm good to date anyone right now."  I had opportunities with The Boy, I think, but I held back, I said no.  I was still so full of seething rage and bitterness over what had happened with my last boyfriend that I knew I couldn't date anybody without it ending in disaster.  I was just  too angry  to be good in a relationship.  Pablo was appalled.  Not only had she already pegged him as a game-player, The Boy is only semi- to medium cute.  She immediately demanded an explanation for what the hell I thought I was doing.   But I  like  him , I told her.  IceQueen was similarly appalled upon finding out, shrieking, " What?     What??  "  Pablo and IceQueen vehemently vetoed any pursuit.  But I liked him.  I still like him.  Meh.   Oh well .  Fuck it, Dude.  Let's go bowling.

With his 5-year old son leaning out next to him, throwing beads to bare-breasted women.  This apartment actually had the biggest crowd hanging around outside.  Frodo and I stood and watched for 10 minutes, but couldn't figure out what the draw was.  His conclusion was, "There really are a lot of pedophiles in the world.  Haha!"  7.  Drunk, mud-covered overalls-wearing hick yelling racial epithets at his friend on the packed subway.  This wasn't so much funny as  extremely uncomfortable .  Frodo and I had been joking about starting a riot all day long.  I turned to him and said, "Now,  that  guy wants to start a riot."   "Yeah," Frodo replied, "If by 'riot,' what you actually mean is ' mob violence .'"  We were relieved to arrive at our station with all limbs intact.  8.  The  three foot  dildo one guy had hanging out his pants.  9.  When, at one bar, I asked for water and got it, and then Frodo asked for water, the bartender just looked at him, said, "Bud light?", Frodo said, "No, water," and the bartender just shook his head and walked away.  [In our defense, we were both  really  hungover from Friday night]  10.  Assless chaps.  'Nuff said.

       Or, What happened?   Things looked to be back on track with The Boy this past week.  He had definitely stepped up the flirting a few very obvious notches.  I assumed this would come to a head Friday night, when we would all be out together at a friend's birthday party.  I was wrong.  Between Thursday and Friday, something happened to make The Boy go ice cold.  I don't know if it was on my end or his.  The only thing that  I  know about is that an old crush of mine came with my friends and I to the hockey game on Thursday night.  Because of my days as GalPal #1 to The Boy, he knows that I had a crush on this guy.  It was part of our daily routine:   The Boy :  Have you made out with X?  Me :  Nope.  Have you called M back? Etc.  So the only thing I can think of is that The Boy heard that the old crush came to the hockey game, and got super-pissed because A)  he thought I was trying to play him or B)  he thinks he's playing second fiddle to this guy.  I didn't invite the old crush to the game...  another girlfriend told him we were going, and he invited himself along (which was okay-- he's a cool guy).   I  had  nothing  to do with him being at the game.  I lost all interested in the old crush as soon as something happened with The Boy, but my bet is that The Boy has no idea this is the case, and may assume that he's still got the old crush as competition.  Anyway, that's the only thing I know of that happened between Thursday (The Boy laying down the flirt hardcore before Civ Pro and later that afternoon in the library) and Friday morning (The Boy being barely civil to me).  If it's not that, it's something going on with him that nobody else knows about...  Friday night we all went to a friend's birthday party downtown.  Frodo, another friend, and The Boy (in a highly unusual move) came over to my apartment beforehand.  Frodo and I had been drinking since 6:30--  he brought over a 32-oz Miller High Life for himself and a 32-oz Miller Lite for me (yeah, we do it real classy-like around here), plus I'd already had two glasses of wine.  The Boy arrived around 10:30.  I gave him a hug and a kiss on the cheek, both of which went unreturned and virtually unnoticed.  He definitely was not his usual ebullient self, to the point where I even asked him if something was wrong, and commented that he seemed uncomfortable.  He said he was fine.  At the club, The Boy, who is usually one of the most social people I know, stood at the same spot along a wall all night, talking to one or two people.  Florida, Frodo, and several other people all commented on his coldness to me.  It was extremely visible.  Although I was working the room, I made an effort to keep coming back to The Boy, and to talk to him.  I might not have even been there;  he wouldn't talk to me.  Efforts at conversation returned the same results as if I'd been talking at a wall.  I asked him again, "Are you alright?" with the same reply-- he was fine.  I didn't buy it then, and I don't buy it now.   Everybody  noticed that he just didn't seem to be there.  I left him a voicemail yesterday asking him if he wanted to meet up with Frodo and I at the Mardi Gras celebrations.  My voicemail has, as of yet, gone unacknowledged. . . again, extremely unusual for him.   This is an unparalleled level of frostiness.  Last night, I IMed him.     Me :  Hey  The Boy :  hola  Me :  Is everything alright with you?  The Boy :  everything is great.  why do you ask?  Me :  Because you were being kind of a jackhole last night.  Like several people even remarked on how cold you were-- it just didn't seem like you were there.  The Boy :  Hmmm.  I felt fine.  I feel fine.  I'm not sure what the explanation is for that.  Me :  Alright.  I'd just like to think that we're good enough friends that if something's bothering you, you can be like, "Yeah, I'm having a shitty day because blah blah blah" instead of being frosty and distant.  But if you say it's all good, I take your word for it.  The Boy :  We are.  If there was something, I'd likely not have even gone, and if I did, I'd tell you what was up.  Me :  Alright.  This conversation is extremely unusual in another aspect-  The Boy didn't even apologize for being a jackhole.  Given how nice and polite he usually is, that shocked the hell out of me.  I expected at least a, "Peach, I'm sorry you thought I was being rude."    Something is up.  Naturally, my girl instinct is to talk about it, but I know this isn't a good idea.  Pushing the issue will only result in driving The Boy away.    I think...  I'm going to ask The Boy to have dinner with me-- a bonafide, planned-in-advance date-- and if that fails, to just let it rest.  I'm not good at letting things go (and by "not good," what I mean is "really shitty"), but I can't keep doing this.  This already isn't a fantastic semester, and incidents like Friday night make me tremendously unhappy.  One more shot, and then I'll really try to let things with The Boy rest.

      You say I am repeating Something I have said before.  I shall say it again. Shall I say it again?  In order to arrive there, To arrive where you are, to get from where you are not, You must go by a way wherein there is no ecstasy. In order to arrive at what you do not know You must go by a way which is the way of ignorance. In order to possess what you do not possess You must go by the way of dispossession. In order to arrive at what you are not You must go through the way in which you are not. And what you do not know is the only thing you know And what you own is what you do not own And where you are is where you are not.

      I said to my soul, be still, and wait without hope For hope would be hope for the wrong thing;  wait without love For love would be love of the wrong thing;  there is yet faith But the faith and the love and the hope are all in the waiting. Wait without thought, for you are not ready for thought: So the darkness shall be light, and the stillness the dancing.

      I went to my first NHL game last night.  I've been to smaller league games in Austin (the Ice Bats), which  ROCK .  Honestly, I have no idea who our team was playing last night, but that didn't stop me from yelling, "KILL HIM!!" and "RIP HIS HEAD OFF!" every time it looked like there  might  be a fight...  or even any time someone body checked someone else.  By the end of the game, the couple sitting to my left couldn't even look at me.  They must have thought I was absolutely wasted (which makes it funnier that I was absolutely sober).  Good times, good times.  Conclusion, though:  I like the smaller league games better.  People are  much  less well-behaved at those, including the players.  Hockey's only really good for the fighting anyway.  Getting as belligerant as the players is half the fun.

      *  Woke up an hour late.  Managed to make it to school at my usual time, though.  I took the world's fastest shower, didn't eat breakfast, didn't pack a lunch, and didn't do all my usual morning time-wasting.  *  The Bagel Man  never showed up  in the Commons this morning.  He better watch out the next time he dares show his face around the law school.  Instead, health-nut that I am, I had a Snickers bar and a Coke.  *  Prof. Crim is the faculty sponsor for our Jessup team.  She wanted them to get one more practice in before they go to Houston tomorrow, so she made us watch them do their oral arguments for  two hours  today during our normal class period.  I pondered trying to self-lobotomize with a dull spoon (and utensils don't get much duller than spoons).  *  During above oral arguments, my cell phone went off.   Oops .  I turn it off every morning before I leave the apartment...  the buttons must have gotten mashed in my backpack sometime during the day.  I didn't feel TOO bad about this, though.  I felt slightly retaliatory for having to watch stupid oral arguments because Prof. Crim wanted her precious team to get in one more practice.

      I saw Mr. Maine today for the first time since he left my apartment Sunday morning.  I was waiting for H &amp; Soup to get out of class, and he came around the corner.   I  didn't feel awkward.  We had a brief conversation.  I was nice, friendly, but not flirty or touchy-feely.  I can tell he knows he screwed up.  Things were cool, though, and I'm glad...  I hate drama, and especially when you know that you're  going  to run into someone occasionally, but you never know when.    He was looking  really  good, and I had to remind myself, "No!  Not doing that!"  I ticked through my mental list of reasons why until I no longer felt (quite as) tempted.

      Check out  urlLink this article  about DJ Danger Mouse's  Grey Album .  What's funny about this is he's probably getting way more exposure than he ever would have had EMI not tried to destroy the album.  For example:  I've already burned copies of the album for several friends.  I only heard about it through word of mouth, and I sure as hell wouldn't have found out about it on my own (I'm not cool enough for that).  It's good, though.  Very good.

      Good Valentine's Day.  I don't understand why it's supposed to be so depressing for single people ( See e.g.,  urlLink Women Not Girls Rule My World  ).  I had a psych professor a few years ago who gave us a list of things that he thought made people happier.  One of them was, "Understand the difference between being alone and being lonely.  They are not the same thing.  Learn to enjoy being by yourself."  It sounds like brusque, depressing advice, but really what he meant was-- learn to enjoy yourself.  Enjoy your own company.  Which is why I never minded living alone, and I don't mind being single (my feelings for The Boy notwithstanding).  I enjoy my own company and for me, being alone is not the same thing as being lonely.  Whenever I think about this, it reminds me of a quote I kept from a short story published in  Wired  years and years ago:  "An overcrowded world is the ideal place in which to be lonely."  (Brian Adliss,  Super-Toys Last All Summer Long , the story on which  AI  was based)  You can be surrounded by millions of people, and although you are not alone, you can definitely be lonely.  I write this now not as affirmation for me, but just because I'm tired of hearing about how we singles are supposed to freak out and be depressed or anxious on Valentine's Day.  It's like being peer-pressured into being miserable.  I had a great time last night-- had a few friends over, ordered pizza, drank beer, and watched  The Big Lebowski .  The funny thing is, last year, I  had  a boyfriend on Valentine's Day, and I honestly can't remember what we did.  I was really trying to remember yesterday, and for the life of me, I couldn't.  I just kept drawing a blank.  Obviously, a tremendously special day, right?  I got Valentine's Day cards to drop in all of my friends' mailboxes.  I had to ask at the grocery store where they were.  At first, the guy said, "Oh, they're over by the flowers."  "The ones little kids give to each other?" I asked.  "Oh.   Oh ."  He mustered up his best sympathetic look and said, "All we have left are a few boxes of 98 Degrees cards."  I think he was surprised when I grinned and said, "That's  perfect .  Where are they?"  These are maybe the most ridiculous cards I've ever seen in my life.  Which makes them fantastic for giving to other people.  I laugh just looking at them.  D &amp; I were joking about wallpapering his room with the leftovers, cuz, you know, 98 Degrees is  HOT .

      Ah, Thursday-night drunkathon...  Frodo and I were pretty bombed by the time we got to the bar at 8.  There had been an alumni networking reception at the school at 5:30.  Frodo went to the library and read while I schmoozed, but came back upstairs at the end of the event to snag a few beers.  Meanwhile, I'd been drinking wine at the reception.  Highlight of the (early) evening:  Seeing a bunch of attorneys wasted out of their minds.  There were more than a few that were just  reeling , they'd had so much to drink.  This only confirms my suspicion that lawyers as a group are just a bunch of drunks.  I met one guy who graduated from Texas Law, so we had to have our twenty minute "All the reasons I love Austin" conversation, made all the better by the fact that he was starting to slur at that point.  I met another lawyer who was from Oklahoma.  Much shit-talking ensued, although he won because I wasn't brave enough to pull out the big guns on someone who's on a recruiting committee.    Frodo and I, pros that we are, went straight from the networking reception to the bar.  I'd even brought a change of clothes to school (no going to bars in a suit).  A couple of hamburgers, pitchers and tequila shots later, we were in pretty good shape when everyone else showed up.  We did karaoke again, always hilarious.  My "Goodbye, Earl" duet with one of my girlfriends consisted mostly of me yelling, "EARL!  EAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARL!" into the microphone every few seconds.  The DJ never did play the Johnny Cash song that Soup  and I were supposed to do, maybe that's why.  An hour later, I was explaining to one of my friends and his fiancee how happy I was that they were getting married.  "No, really.  I  love you guys .  I'm so happy-- no really-- I'm so happy you guys are getting married!"  Then I switched to babbling nearly incoherently about how I love The Boy.  "I'm not  in love  with him, but I love him.  NO, you guys don't understand, I love him!"  Next came the babbling about how I love all our law school friends so much, and that they're my best friends ever, and "I mean, I had  friends  in high school and college, but you guys-- I  love  you guys."  Oh, man.  I guess like H said yesterday, "At least you're a happy drunk."

      1.  I found out today that one of my friends is #1 in our class.  That just blew my mind.  I thought she'd be top 10%, but  damn .  Good job, girl.  2.  One of my friends had a doctor's appointment recently where she was told that she's probably had mono for 2 months.  This is a problem for me, as I kissed her two weeks ago.  It certainly would explain why I've been feeling so exhausted lately.  3.  Interview yesterday:  my interviewer said that he would like to blow up our business school.  He actually said, "I'd dynamite it in a second, if given the opportunity."  What do you say to that?   "Here,  have a percocet" ?  I think he has some major inner rage.

      I don't think I'll be seeing Mr. Maine again.  Not because of the ruffled shirt-- that was merely the icing on the cake.  A myriad of things, but the real kicker was something he said Saturday night.  I couldn't tell if he was joking or serious, but at any rate, it made me feel threatened.  It set immediate alarm bells off in my head and made me think, " Whoooooaa , what the  fuck  was that??"  I'm not spending time with someone who makes me feel unsafe or like I need to be afraid of him.   Now comes the process of blowing him off.  Ugh.

       At this moment, what is your favorite...  1. ...song?  Tie between "Bang Bang" (Dispatch) and Hold Up (Murphy Lee).  "Temptation" (Beyonce & Missy Eliot) comes in 2nd.  Dispatch rocks.  Total serendipity that I found out about them:  I was searching online for Bang Bang by Nancy Sinatra, and accidentally downloaded Dispatch's Bang Bang instead.   2. ...food?  This city has a serious paucity of good food.  I have been digging the Southwest Chicken quesadillas made at the neighborhood grocery store, though.   Also, the Bun Cha Thit Nuong (crispy spring rolls w/ grilled pork & vermicelli noodles) at the Vietnamese place down the street is  so so so so so so so so  good  .   3. ...tv show?  Hello,  Alias .  This never changes.  In fact, add to the agenda below:  Watch  Alias  DVDs.   4. ...scent?  Alfred Sung Shi. Am also a huge fan of anything freesia.   5. ...quote?  None right now, only little snippets of songs I like: I was five and he was six, we rode on horses made of sticks . . . Baby girl wanna handle her bidniz . . . Just looking for the right temptation . . . Firefly, that's what you are . . .    And I'm adding this one: 6. ...taste?  Mango.

      Mr. Maine showed up in ruffled shirt, bowler hat, and wingtips.    ...  This problem, however, was solved by downing 5 vodka & cranberries in quick succession, courtesy of the open bar.    The formal-- or Prom, as we took to calling it-- was decent.  Decent food, decent music, decent bar.  She didn't have rasberry Stoli, and couldn't make me a white russian, but she had a vodka & cranberry or gin & tonic ready for me whenever she saw me circling the bar.  My best friends at the school didn't go.  They're all older single guys who had the, "I'm not going to high school prom again," reaction.  It's unfortunate;  I think we would have had way more fun had they been there.  Things would have gotten pretty damn rowdy.  Only one of my usual enablers was in attendance, and he had his out of town girlfriend with him, so no lining up tequila shots last night.  On today's agenda: *  Read.  Think I left my Crim book at school, which means I'll actually have to leave the apartment, damnit. *  Clean the aforementioned apartment.  For some reason, our apartment is absolutely filthy.  Part of our dining room floor is sticky.  Our kitchen floor is not its usual white color.  The wood flooring in the living room and part of the dining room is a strange matte texture instead of shiny and glossy.  It's gross. *  Go back to sleep.  Mmm, sweet sleep.

      I may not be blogging until at least Sunday.  I am getting my nails done tomorrow for the formal.  Although I can paint my own toes, I am absolutely incapable of painting my nails and having it look like I didn't just play with finger-paints.  So I won't be doing anything post-manicure that might involve chipping nails or otherwise messing up my booteefull hands.  Mr. Maine is threatening to wear a ruffled shirt with his tux.  Let us all hope that he is kidding, and if not, that with a little bit of luck, he won't be able to find a ruffled shirt.  He told Florida today that he found a lime green ruffled shirt.  I will assume for the sake of my sanity that was a (sick) joke.

      Read  urlLink this .    I quote:  "We were extremely disappointed by elements of the MTV-produced halftime show. . . They were totally inconsistent with assurances our office was given about the content of the show.  It's unlikely that MTV will produce another Super Bowl halftime."  As P-Diddy said, if it weren't for MTV, CBS probably wouldn't have  had  a halftime show.  Whiny babies--  JJ's boob on national TV is  never  a bad thing.

        urlLink Dave  got accepted to  urlLink UCLA  for grad school!!!!!!!!!!!   Wow.  This is the kind of stuff that makes me think what a long way we've come since 8th/9th grade.  It really does seem like yesterday that everybody was starting high school, getting accepted to college, graduating high school, starting college, and now...  graduating college and moving on to grad school.  Absolutely unbelievable.  Congratulations.  :)

      I have a little problem.  After we left the bar on Thursday night, Mr. Maine and I sat on my couch, talking for what seemed like  forever .  This is not the problem.  The problem is that I can't remember a single word of what was said.  I think this is because:  1.  I was a little more drunk than I thought.  Although I didn't feel that drunk, over the course of a few hours, I'd had 4 beers, a buttery nipple, and a tequila shot.    2.  The entire time, I was thinking, "When in the hell is he going to kiss me?" instead of really focusing on the conversation.  We honestly were sitting there for a truly long time.  And so when, after Mr. Maine asked me Friday night what my parents did, and I said, "And yours?" there was a pause before he told me what his dad did and said with a smile, "Which you would remember if you'd been paying attention last night."  I vaguely remembered something about an ENT, now that he mentioned it.  But the fact that I hadn't remembered off the top of my head worried me.  This was the first clue I had that the entire conversation was pretty much gone from my memory.  Now we have a major problem.  Mr. Maine sent me an email last night with a picture attached.  His comment was, "Look at this photo and tell me if you recognize anyone (you should be able to ID two of the 'people' in the picture)."  I took one look at the picture and thought, "Oh  shit .  Now how am I going to get out of this one?"  The picture is of two Chinese kids with someone in a gorilla suit and another person in a chicken suit.  All four are holding badmitten rackets.  Is this something we talked about Thursday night?   Hell if I know .  I can only assume it is.  I stared at the picture, wondering, "Is he going to be upset when he realizes I only vaguely recall our conversation?"  If he thought of it as a bonding experience, it surely can't be helpful that everything he said is going to need repeating.  I wrote back:  As for the picture, oh man, I'm so totally busted.  BUT -- BUT!  I thought, "I should send Mr. Maine a picture in return."  I couldn't decide which picture, though, so you get your choice of: 1.  A fish at the Baltimore aquarium;  or 2.  Me a few hours after taking the LSAT.    I attached the two referenced pictures and sandwiched this part of the email-- the bad news,  Oh, by the way, I clearly don't know what the hell this picture is about, even though you seemed to think it would make me laugh  part-- in between two other funny parts.  To make it less important, you know?  Result?  He hasn't emailed me back yet.  I have a feeling I'm in trouble for this one.

        	From : 	  [Mr. Army]  	Subject : 	In Defense of Controversy  	Date : 	March 31, 2004 4:36:37 PM CST  	To : 	  Announcements  Dear ALL:  Apparently my email in defense of a faculty member's comments about law review experience has caused quite a stir.    At least two people have suggested that such an email is an abuse of the ability to send a school-wide email.  I must admit, I don't see how. As far my perusal of the honor code went, I didn't see that I violated it.  However, if someone knows otherwise, please let me know.  The fact is, there is not an outlet for controversy at this school.  There is no working student newspaper, there are no debates (that I have seen advertised) between clubs that have differing political views--there is no nothing to foster healthy controversy at all.  Isn't that what law school is all about? The fact is, that right now, email is the most effective way to communicate with fellow students.  If anyone out there is interested in reviving the Devil's Advocate, or starting a new student newspaper PLEASE LET ME KNOW!!  I'm working [here]  this summer and I would love to get a student newspaper running at the law school.  The fact is, the subject matter of my email about law review "prestige" is exactly the kind of thing a student newspaper should be addressing--rather than hallway gossip, or viscious emails back and forth between students.  I mean what journal is "best"; saying "they're all the same"; telling whatever wacko who sends out crazy campus-wide emails that he is a nut; asking "what can I do to get ahead in the job market"; are sure as heck not "private" concerns.  WE ALL DISCUSS THEM EVERYDAY!!!  And these issues would be perfectly addressed in student newspaper articles, in letters to the editor, op-ed pieces, etc.  Look, we pay 32,000+ to attend the First Rate Law School (and believe me, I'm happy as hell that I got accepted here!!)--we (the student body) ought to be able to debate controversial issues without lots of folks gettin' all huffy and puffy.    So if anyone wants to revive a student newspaper, EMAIL ME!! We'll get it running this summer.  I hope making a plea to start a student newspaper is deemed an "appropriate" use of the campus-wide email system.  [Mr. Army]    Note:  That "First Rate Law School" business?  That was all him, not me.  I don't know how you can call Jethro's School of Lawyerin' "first rate," but there  are  rumors we are moving up in the Redneck Times rankings this year, due to our aggressive recruiting of near-homo sapiens from Alabama and Mississippi.  But seriously...  I read this email, and aside from the feeling of intense fantra that welled up inside me, I wanted to slam my head into a wall because it would be less painful than witnessing this stupidity.  It's not that you committed an honor code violation, you  idiot , it's that it was totally inappropriate to involve  600+  people in a debate known originally only to 40 or so.  It's that, no matter how well-intentioned you might have been, your actions only made things bad for Prof. Con Law.  Christ Almighty.  The LSAT needs a new section to test social aptitude, I swear to god.    Someone approaches you at Orientation and attempts small-talk.  You:  A.  Tell them where you're from, where you went for undergrad, and what type of law you want to do. B.  Babble on about how high your LSAT score was, how you could have gone to HLS, and how the poor sucker talking to you doesn't have a shot in hell at being in the top 10% compared to you, you brilliant pasty-white pimpled thing. C.  Cower in a corner, terrified at the prospect of human interaction. D.  Smear yourself with your own feces and wonder when feeding time is.    B might get you a full scholarship, but A might keep you from getting summarily shot by your classmates.  It's a tough choice.

      The good thing is that some people have taken it upon themselves to lighten the potential impact of Mr. Army's ridiculously stupid email.

I just want to defend Professor [Contracts] when he said almost 2 years ago in my 1L Contracts class that there is "no duty to mitigate your damages" in a contract case. What he actually meant was to differentiate between a "mandatory" mitigation of damages and a "suggested" mitigation. I know that this has caused a lot of controversy throughout the school, so I thought to take it upon myself to settle it once and for all.

        By-Line:  Scandal Rocks Law School . . . well, not really    Sub By-Line:  Law school not sure what hit it, but DOES know it was rocked   The Set-Up:  Prof. Con Law ("PCL") received the Professor of the Year award, after having been on our law school's faculty for less than a year.  He's generally adored by his students, plays on the intramural soccer team with the guys in my section, and tells fun stories about when he clerked for Rehnquist.  Last week, on the day of the write-on competition meeting, PCL told our Con Law class that every one of us should try to write onto the journal if we weren't grading on.  We have three journals, making writing onto one of them a decent possibility, given the number of people they take, and the size of our class.  Additionally, he stated that of the three,  Quarterly  is the most prestigious.  He noted that all the federal judges he knows sort resumes into two piles:  the journal pile and the no-journal pile.  Out of the three journals at our school, without a doubt, he knew  Quarterly  would carry the most weight with employers.  Today, he came into class and told us that several 2Ls and 3Ls had confronted him for allegedly saying that the other two journals were trash and not worth writing onto, or doing.  He had corrected the 2 &amp; 3Ls, and wanted to take the opportunity to correct us, since the upperclassmen heard it from us.  He made a point of saying that the other journals were prestigious, worth doing, and a great experience.   Any  journal is better than doing no journal.  However, he said, he was sticking by his point that  Quarterly  was the most prestigious out of the three.  It didn't mean the other two weren't valuable, but facts are facts, and whoever tried to tell us that  Quarterly  wasn't the most prestigious was patently wrong.  Enter idiocy, as if on cue.  A voice piped up from the back of the room.  It was Mr. Army, who, well, is famous anyway for his "class contributions" last semester.  "You mean to say," Mr. Army asked incredulously, "That there are people who disagree with you?  Who really don't think that  Quarterly  is the most prestigious?"  PCL said, "I guess so."  " Oh my ," said Mr. Army.  His disbelief and incredulity were evident.   Shocking !  At 10:20, an hour and twenty minutes into our two hour long class, an email went out to Announcements, the address that sends an email to   the entire law school, including administration and faculty  .  The email:     	From : 	  [Mr. Army]  	Subject : 	In Defense of Prof. [Con Law]  	Date : 	March 31, 2004 10:20:33 AM CST  	To : 	  Announcements  Dear ALL:  My name is [Mr. Army], and it is true, I am just a lowly 1L.  I am also about 100 miles away from "grading on to" anything.    But it has come to my attention that some among us (the student body) are a little upset at Professor [Con Law] for stating the obvious:  That Quarterly is the most "prestigious" of the three journals here at [the law school].  If there is no other reason for this, might it be that Quarterly is the oldest of the three?  Or is it also a shock that old institutions (universities, newspapers, etc.) are almost inevitably the most "prestigious" of their respective class?  Again, let no one assume I am particularly smart, or have much of a chance of adding my name to Quarterly's role.  But before any of us get to whiny with crying in our beer at not being in the top 10%, or not grading on to Quarterly, perhaps a little perspective is in order.  1. [The law school]'s placement in 2002, 6 months past graduation was something like 97%. 2. The justices of the IL Supreme Court went to the following law schools:    Loyola, John Marshall, John Marshall, Loyola, SLU, Iowa, and Antioch Law school in D.C. and only one of      their bios mentions that he was on law review. 3. The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee (Bill Thomas) went to a community college, and got his BA and MA from San Francisco State University--not exactly an "elite" university. 4. The Chairman of Winston & Strawn (James Thompson, also on the 9-11 investigation committee) graduated from Northwestern in 1959, before Northwestern was "elite", and his bio does not mention that he graduated with honors, or was on Law Review. 5. The managing partner at Winston & Strawn graduated from Depaul and his bio also does not mention that he was on law review, or graduated with honors.   If you have read attorney bios you know that law review always shows up if the attorney has that credential.  I could go on.  But of course the point is there are million and one ways to become successful in this country, and no one at a law school like [ours] should be whining about not being on law review...or worried that Quarterly just is the most "prestigious" of the three journals.  That's how it is at every school. Prof. Con Law never suggested that unless you are on Quarterly you won't be successful. And he was very clear that all journal experience is more than worthwhile.  But if anyone out there is interested in selling his or her soul to a firm like Skadden, or Cravath...or clerking for a Federal Judge, then he or she should properly know the "resume value" of Quarterly as opposed to one of the other journals.  That was PCL's only point.  And it's a point that is more than obvious to anyone who has read Vault Reports, or the bios of former federal clerks, law professors, etc.  Of course if you look at the bios of powerful politicians, powerful partners at major law firms, state supreme court justices, etc.  you will find plenty of people without Law Review or Order of the Coif on their resume.  Just a thought.  [Mr. Army]     This was a double slap in the face for PCL: Not only did Mr. Army publicize a debate that was unknown to the student population outside of our class (30 people) and a few of the journal editors, he did it  while he was supposed to be paying attention to PCL in PCL's class .  Idiocy, people, idiocy.  A few moments later, a new email arrived in my in-box.  It was from the editor-in-chief of the Law &amp; Policy journal.     	From : [Editor-in-Chief]  	Subject : 	Re: In Defense of Prof. [Con Law]  	Date : 	March 31, 2004 10:41:07 AM CST  	To : 	  Announcements  An Open Letter to [Mr. Army]:  I appreciate your attempt to keep law-review membership in perspective for the sake of those in your class who are perhaps very worried about law reviews.  While I hope that all 1Ls will seriously consider participating in the write-on, we who feel strongly about legal scholarship must accept that other activities around the school may take precedent for some.  I must take issue, however, with the impropriety of your e-mail.  You have brought to the fore what should have remained a private discussion among a few law review executives and a few members of the faculty.  If you have a problem with the law reviews, please come to my office (113A) to discuss your problem in a discreet forum.  The three editors-in-chief will discuss, individually, the strengths of the three law reviews as we circulate through the halls and the commons in the upcoming months.  I feel prepared and willing to objectively discuss the strengths of the three law reviews, and will do so on a face-to-face basis, given the opportunity for back-and-forth dialogue.  Shocking the whole school by publicly discussing the fallout of one classroom incident, is simply not appropriate for the "Announcements" list.  Sincerely,  Editor-in-Chief [Law School] Journal of Law & Policy    I was very impressed that Editor side-stepped the issue of which journal was more prestigious, and went straight to the fact that Mr. Army's email was mind-numbingly inappropriate.  I was also impressed by his fairly neutral tone.  Very professional, I thought.  By the end of Con Law, however, I just felt pretty sorry for PCL.  There he was, up at the front of the classroom, with  no idea  that Mr. Army-- however well intentioned-- had just embarrassed him in front of the entire school.  Someone in my class IMed me and asked, "Should we tell him before he leaves the classroom?  In case someone accosts him in the hallway?"  We debated, but that seemed likely to produce even more embarrassment, and we were sure he would find out soon enough, without our interference.  This is another instance in which my classmates' social ignorance just...  wow.  It leaves me speechless.  Utterly speechless.  I feel total fantra for Mr. Army, and pretty terrible for Prof. Con Law.

      School-wide email received today...    Date : Mon, 29 Mar 2004 15:21:43 -0600  From : SBA President  To : Class2004, Class2005, Class2006  Subject : This is not a joke...  As much as I would like this to be a joke, a new law school low has been achieved...  The night crew that cleans the building has run across a problem.  No, it is not that we are leaving food wrappers or failing to push our seats in after class.  Rather, it seems that STUDENTS ARE HAVING SEX IN THE BUILDING. Members of the crew have discovered students in the library study rooms on multiple occasions in the last few months.  So, here are few helpful pieces of information:  1.  Doing it in the law school violates the University Judicial Code. Keep it in mind the next time you can't keep your pants on.  Just imagine the beauty of having to explain to the Bar Examiners that you were charged with getting it on in a study room.  Classy, classy work.  2.  This puts the night staff in a weird position.  I imagine that the job is not the easiest in the world and it is not made better by walking in on students with their bare asses in the air.  3.  This is really advice rather than information:  STOP IT.  To whoever is doing this, what the hell is wrong with you?  I am betting that you do not live more than ten minutes away from the school.  If not, there are several hotels within ten minutes.  I mean, Christ, at least go out to your car so we do not have to worry about getting your fluids on our belongings. Seriously though, how does this come about?  Do you walk up to the reserve desk, notice an attractive student, and say "Hey, Sweet Thing, I see you are reading the Southwestern reporter.  Want to go back to my glass-walled study room and discuss some obscenity law?"  I realize that I have no game, but I would have never thought that line would work.  To sum up, sorry for the rant.  However, this is an issue that needed to be addressed and I drew the lucky straw.  Please stop banging in the library. It will make life easier, even if somewhat less humorous, for all of us.  Thanks for the time,  sorry if I offended anyone,  have a good day,  go home to do it,  SBA President  P.S. Oral sex does count as sex in this situation.

      The running joke Friday went something like:  A:  It's admitted students day. B:  Oh?  What are you?  Weren't you admitted? A:  Oh, for me, every day is Wish-We-Hadn't-Admitted-Her/Him-Day or Now-We-Know-Better-Day.  Or even Please-Get-The-Hell-Out-Of-Our-Law-School-Day.  It's possible that our law school has admitted a class even more socially inept than my own.  Admitted students day coincided, you would imagine fortuitously, with one of the largest happy hours of the year:  the Women's Law Caucus auction.  Happy hour was packed, but strangely enough, not with Pre-Ls.  We saw only 4 or 5 that we could readily identify as Prells.  I did meet  one  cool Prell who just graduated from film school.  I'm pretty sure he'll be coming here next year, although I'm not altogether certain that we didn't terrify him.  On the plus side, he blew Florida &amp; I a kiss before he left our apartment, so he couldn't have been too terrified.  We'll see if he's in the ranks of '07 next fall, or whether he sends the administration a rejection letter noting, "I met Larry, Florida, et. al.  No way in  hell ."  On the other hand, I had an almost uncontrollable urge to kill a different Prell.  Scene:  I'm giving Prell a ride back to his car from the bar a bunch of us were at.  I'm attempting to make small-talk, be helpful, the usual.  Within less than three minutes of being in my car, I was privy to the following :  Prell:  My GPA and LSAT score are so high, I'm guaranteed to be in the top 10% here. Me:  (long pause)  Oh? Prell:  Yeah, there's basically no way I  won't  be in the top 10%. Me:  (silence) Prell:  And when you combine that with my work experience*, there's no way I won't be at the top of my class. Me, thinking:  It's gonna be  real  hard for you to be at the top of the class after  I push you out of my moving car .  *His work experience consists of 1 year of IT.  He's actually younger than me (I'm 23).  I didn't launch into my, "After you get to law school, you discover that LSAT isn't necessarily predictive of your success" speech.  There are plenty of people with high LSATs who ended up in the middle or the bottom of the class.  And plenty of people with low LSAT scores who are at the top of the class.  But I figured, hey, this guy  clearly  knows way more than me.  After all, he's  guaranteed  to be in the top 10% of the class.  He then went on to tell me that he didn't care that there were all these people from Harvard, Stanford, Cornell, etc., here, because he went to a no-name school, didn't spend all that money, and is in exactly the same place as those poor suckers.  Like somehow, he's managed to pull one over on those Harvard kids by going to Jimbo's School of Readin' &amp; Writin' fer Simians.  At this point, I was trying to remember the Model Penal Code definition of vehicular manslaughter and wondering whether "crime in the service of the public interest" could be a factor in the Sentencing Guidelines.  Jesus, I hate gunners.  That kid is going to be the King of the All-Stars in his class, I can feel it already.  It's a tough job, but I suppose someone has to do it.  As a final note:  If you are a Pre-L attending an admitted students day, stick around for the events where you get to socialize with current students in an informal setting.  I got a pretty good feel for my school from the way the administration treated during the admissions process, but there are things you just cannot learn about a school except from talking to the students.  Additionally, there are people like me there, for better or for worse, who want to take you out, show you a good time, and get you fucked up.  How can you turn that down?

Wish I'd gotten it last night-- we had 30 people at our apartment last night, we would have drunk ourselves into a stupor celebrating.

      Tomorrow is our school's admitted students day.  The Pre-Ls are invited to our Friday Happy Hour, which is supposed to be one of the best of the year, as the Women's Law Caucus is holding its annual auction to raise money for the public interest stipend.  Our plan thus far is to see if we can't get some Pre-Ls to come out with us tomorrow night and get them wasted out of their minds.  I don't know why, but for some reason, the idea of getting a couple of prospectives drunk just amuses us to no end.  Mmm, fresh meat...

      To be filed under, "Reasons Why Lonestar Gato Is Weird."  I use Burt's Bees Wax lip balm... it's got some kind of mint oil in it, I think peppermint.  Tonight, putting it on before I went to bed, Lonestar Gato walked over to me and experimentally sniffed it.  I waved it back and forth a little in front of him, and he shied away.  A moment later, however, he came back for more sniffing.    I rubbed a little of the balm onto my finger and extended it to him.   And he licked it off .  My cat likes mint.  ...  I'm kind of at a loss as to what to say about that.

      A search term landing  someone  here today: blog "mr. stanford."   ... Just because I talk about someone doesn't mean I want them reading my blog, even if I haven't said anything shitty about them. Lesson learned, I guess.

      I'm ranked #1 out of 7 in my Yahoo group for March Madness.  I still have 166 possible points.  The next person down from me, D, has 137.  7 of my Elite Eight teams are still intact.  My Final Four is pristine.  Life is good. [Though maybe I shouldn't brag so soon]

      Last night was fairly tame, as I was so absolutely exhausted.  I just didn't have it in me to keep up with the rest of the kids.    However, as I said, this semester has taken a turn for the sketchier.  We were watching basketball over at my place all day yesterday.  A bunch of people showed up to watch the Texas/UNC game.  Mr. Stanford walked into our apartment, followed by a man who must have been in at least his 50s, who was so drunk that he could barely stand on his own.  I'd never seen him before, and given that he appeared to be in his late 50s, I was immediately on alert for Pure Sketch.  "Stanford," I said, "Who the fuck is this guy?" "He's a friend of mine," he said.  "Stanford '85 alum." "Bullshit, who the fuck is he?" Finally Mr. Stanford admitted that he'd never met the guy before, but that he'd been at a bar watching the Bama/Stanford game ( which I totally called, btw ), and had started talking to this guy.  He was, in fact, a Stanford alum, and at first Mr. Stanford was just going to give him a ride home because he was so drunk he couldn't drive himself.  The alum, however, was like, "Nooooo, I don't wanna gooooo hoooome.  I wanna hang out with  you guys ."  So Mr. Stanford thought it would be a good idea to bring this drunk-ass old man to my house.  The old man was clearly making everybody uncomfortable, and was truly killing the mood, but it didn't get really bad until he started  ripping ass continuously  and utterly unapologetically.  I'm not even sure he noticed.  Being a little bit more sober, however, the rest of us had a harder time ignoring his  giant farts .  Mr. Stanford's girlfriend was about to cry, she was trying so hard not to laugh.  I think she finally had to leave the room.  The rest of us were trying to ignore it.  Which, you know, is hard when someone's farting every 30 seconds so loud it could probably be heard in the apartment next door.  Finally, thankfully, Mr. Stanford and friends left, taking their drunk old man with them, but  wow .  This weekend was just pure shadiness, epitomized and capped off by a drunk and farting old man.

      This semester has definitely taken a turn for the sketchier.  After class on Friday, we headed straight to a bar to watch basketball.  We were there until happy hour.  It's always kind of shocking to walk out of a bar, squint because of the glaring sunlight, and realize, "It's the middle of the day, and I'm kinda buzzed."    We'd heard there was going to be Guinness at Happy Hour, so we made a quick stop to pick up a bottle of Bailey's and a couple of shot glasses.  You bet your ass we'll do car bombs in the middle of the law school courtyard.  When we arrived, we discovered SBA only had kegs of Killian's.  Not to be deterred, we had someone drive us back to the grocery store so we could buy a 12-pack of Guinness.  We're dedicated people.  Friday night had the potential to be absolutely explosive.  There's been a situation developing between several people at the law school, and it looked like it might really come to a head on Friday night.  I'm usually all for spreading the law school gossip, but this is something I really would rather not be involved in, despite having been sucked in a bit tangentially.  There was a scene at Happy Hour.  Not anything involving screaming or all-out fighting, but enough to make several people who weren't aware of the situation wonder what the hell was going on.  I think the reason it didn't blow up is because I went out with a group of guys I hadn't been out with in awhile, and took one of the key players with me.  Extracting him from the situation kept it from worsening.  Although we went to several bars (one of which I don't even remember being at), we ended up on the east side of the city at a strip club.  East Law School City is basically a demilitarized zone.  They don't have places like this in the south, except maybe in New Orleans.  The worst parts of Houston look like Disney Land in comparison.  Dallas' "ghetto" area that we were terrified to drive through in high school is a joke compared to the east side of this city.  I don't go to the east side during the day, let alone drunk out of my mind at night.  Somehow, however, we ended up deciding that we wanted to go to a strip club.  We figured we would just drive around the east side until we found one.  Clearly, a good idea.  Frodo claims that the strip club we went to is the sketchiest place he has ever been, which, if you know Frodo, says a lot.  The boy knows sketch.    Funny thing is, it turns out it wasn't so much a strip club as it was   a brothel  .  Within 5 minutes of arrival, The Kraut had been propositioned for sex.  $40 for a lay.  $20 for a BJ.  I didn't realize that we'd actually been at a whorehouse (in the parlance of our times) until Saturday morning, when someone asked me if I'd gotten a lap dance.  I realized that I hadn't, and wondered why.  I asked Frodo if it was because I didn't want to pay for one, and the boys didn't either.  This struck me as highly improbable, since guys seem to  live  for seeing their girl friends molested by strippers.  He told me that  nobody  in that place was getting lap dances...  although some were getting fucked (more on this later).  Naturally, being a woman in a strip club, I did warrant a lot of attention from the strippers.  Usual stripper rules did not apply.  One put her hands on my boobs and I was like, "Um, hi, can you not?"  Although this was my first time in a strip club, I knew that you're not supposed to touch strippers, as it's likely to get you thrown out of the club.  One of the women made clear that this rule clearly wasn't in effect by grabbing both of my hands and planting them square on her chest.  I think the funniest thing about this, however, was how utterly disaffected we all were.  I'm not sure if that was the alcohol or not.  Frodo and I: *  Ended up sitting at the bar; *  Having a serious conversation while sitting at said bar; *  While eating Cheez-its; *  Surrounded by topless women; *  And noting occasionally that various men were  getting fucked  on the couches behind us.  None of this got in the way of our discussing The Situation at the Law School, and other various sundry topics.  Our reaction to our surroundings:  Meh-- whatev.  Said Pablo later, "I can't believe you guys didn't get mugged.  The four of you must have stood out like a sore thumb." Responded Frodo, "What, you mean in my French Connection blazer and Armani jeans?"  Other observations: *  There were no fake tits in attendance Friday night. *  Not only were the strippers' boobs not humongous, they weren't even big. *  They were mostly really small and floppy. *  They were also wearing flesh-colored pasties.  It took me awhile to figure this out.  At first, I thought, "Oh my god, that girl is so horribly scarred."  Additionally, I doubt the pasties served any real function as, according to Frodo, "You had a lot of vagina in your face Friday night."  (Me:  "Really?  Huh.")  Friday night was another one of those where I wake up the next day and just feel a little bit speechless.  I think the reason I wasn't utterly terrified at various points during the night was because I was so blitzed.  For instance, when I noticed that The Kraut was doing 95 on the highway as we were leaving the east side, I wasn't thinking, "We are going to die.  We are going to die."  I was thinking, "Man... it feels really good with the windows down."  When I was thrown back against the leather seat because he took a ramp so fast, I just thought it was kind of cool.  I thought, "I love Audis."  The Kraut is fairly notorious at school for his crazy driving, but I'm not sure I've driven with him before.  I'm thinking about maybe not doing it again, hah.  I woke up Saturday morning and spent forever in the shower because I felt like I couldn't get the smoke stench off me.  I chain smoked at least two packs Friday night, Frodo went through a pack and a half, The Kraut and friend went through at least a pack each.  What's funny about this:  Although The Kraut is a chain-smoker already, Frodo and I don't smoke.  At all.  I think we just needed something to do.  But we were literally lighting our cigarettes off the ones in our mouths.  It was about 4 in the afternoon on Saturday before the smoke taste left my mouth.  I felt shockingly good on Saturday morning, considering how much I'd had to drink.  I think this is because I drank 1/2 a bottle of Pedialyte on the rocks before I went to bed.  I was exhausted, but at least I didn't puke 4 times like Frodo did.

       tonight's text messages   Frodo, 5:17 PM:  Really bored, must find someone to enable. Me, 5:23 PM:  We are watching AmIdol @ 730-meby drink then?  aww hell, come on over now.  Tonight was tame.  Pina coladas, Guinness, and vodka cranberries.  We had Guinness with lunch today, to celebrate St. Patrick's day.  A lot of my other friends were going  out  out, but ...  there's too much I want to get done tomorrow.  Can't do that if I'm hungover or tired.  So, I stayed in, obsessed over American Idol, and ordered sushi from a place down the street.  Tuna rolls,  yum .  It's getting to be crunch time here in law school land...  our open appellate brief assignment is gaining momentum, must do research for that.  At the same time, trying to outline and starting to review for finals in 6 weeks.    I really can't believe 1L is almost over.  I'm glad, but at the same time...  I have this sinking feeling that everything is going to be so different next year, and not in a good way either.  Oh well.  I've been saying this a lot this semester:  The Dude abides.

      All during Civ Pro, H was bugging me to fill out my brackets on Yahoo.  Midway through class, Frodo disappeared for 20 minutes.  I found out at lunch that he'd gone to the computer lab to print out the NY Times bracket and spent the rest of class filling it out.  I finally (H was practically hysterical by this point) filled out my brackets at the end of lunch.  My picks are based on my own sense of basketball intuition.  Some  other  people refer to this as sheer guessing in the face of complete and utter ignorance.  Happily enough, though, I ended up with the same Final Four as my most all-knowing-about-basketball friend (though he had Duke going all the way).  Ignorance is bliss, baby!  We have: Sweet Sixteen:  Washington, KU, GA Tech, MSU, Texas Tech, Florida, Pitt, OSU,Duke, Illinois, UT, Mississippi State, Bama, Syracuse, NC State, UConn Elite Eight:  KU, GA Tech, Florida, Pitt, Duke, UT, Syracuse, UConn Final Four:  GA Tech, Pitt, Duke, UConn  Right now I have the national championship between GA Tech & UConn.  I'm wavering, though.  Additionally, I  know  I am an absolute traitor for taking UT down to Duke.  But, I'm sorry, after the OSU game, I've lost faith.  Oh well.  At least I have until Thursday to tinker.  It's basketball time!!

      I always take it as a good sign when I wake up totally sober at 3 AM, yet utterly confused.  I don't remember much about dinner, but I know my rasberry margarita (and Frodo's, since I finished his) was  really  good.  The Camo was not so good.  It tastes like they  added  beer flavoring.  I poured it into a cup and chugged it as best I could, and even then it was hard to choke down.  For those who don't remember, Camo is "beer" that comes in a 24-oz can and is 9% alcohol.  It's awful, but it'll do the job.  I'm assuming-- as I woke up fully clothed with the lights on-- that I came home and passed out on my bed after dinner.  Good call.  I'll have to find out tomorrow what exactly happened.  It's clear from our kitchen and living room that there was some Asshole-playing (cards strewn everywhere) and some shot-taking (2 shot glasses in the kitchen that smell like rasberry rum-- yuck), but I think I probably wasn't a part of that.  For now, time to go back to bed.

      I'm back.  This entire week, I've been admittedly lame.  Any attempts to get me out of the house have utterly failed, unless for trips to Blockbuster or the Vietnamese place 1 block over and 2 blocks down.  Frodo got back in town today.  At 11, my phone rang.  "I'm at Chicago-O'Hare," he said, "I'll be back in a few hours.  When are we drinking?"  Frodo is my enabler, clearly.  At 3:30, Florida and I busted out the handle of rum.  I'm about to finish a hurricane glass of pina colada.  Tasty, tasty.  That Camo in my fridge?  Gone by tomorrow, guaranteed.    In a little while, we're headed out for Mexican.  Well, Florida and The Czech's girlfriend are planning on eating.  Frodo and I will be drinking our dinners at the bar.  Tuaca-ritas and rasberry margaritas with sugar-rimmed glasses... oh so sweet.  It's Saturday in the Lonestar household, baby!

      So I saw The Passion tonight.  Afterwards, I just didn't know what to do.  I felt shell-shocked.  It was extremely violent, and yeah, I cried.  The only part I didn't watch was when they were driving stakes through Jesus' hands and legs.  Nobody left the theatre, which surprised me.  Afterwards, The Czech's girlfriend said she came extremely close to leaving.  None of us really had anything to say after coming out of the theatre.  What do you  do  after a movie like that?  We needed time to decompress, I think.  The Czech, I guess to lighten the mood, said that he couldn't stop thinking about law during the movie.  Like Pontius Pilate didn't have personal jurisdiction over Jesus, so he removed Jesus to Herod.  You know you're a law student when you're thinking about civil procedure during maybe the most intense movie you've ever seen.  I'm glad I saw it, but I will never see it again.  I was wary of seeing it because of what I'd heard.  Florida practically had to drag me along with her and The Czech.    Additional note:  Criticisms of the historical accurace of Gibson's portrayal of the Roman and Jewish roles in Jesus' condemnation are well-warranted.

      A story today about how one of my girlfriends had to physically fight off a male classmate of ours earlier this week.  First, and let's just get this out of the way, wrong wrong wrong.  Second, how do people think they can get away with this, especially in law school?  Things get out.  A ton of people know by now.   urlLink DG  recently wrote about a  urlLink nasty fight  between a couple in the student lounge.   urlLink IA  commented that "They should realize that the law community is very small . . . and this will haunt them for years."  This is absolutely true.  IceQueen, Pablo, and I had already pegged this guy as a predator/d-bag before classes even started last fall.  This particular story is spreading like wildfire now, and people will absolutely remember it.  If I run into him 5 years from now, I guarantee you that I will remember she had to  physically fight her way free  of him.  Third, I never came across this type of thing much in undergrad.  Rather, I just didn't hear about it.  I didn't experience it personally.  None of the guys I was with ever got aggressive in a way that made me uncomfortable or scared me.  But here at law school...  One of my other girlfriends told me a terrifying story about the time she was sexually assaulted in undergrad.  Another girlfriend has an even more disturbing story from when she was quite a bit younger.  I've noticed that I personally have become much more sensitive to aggressive behavior in men.  My antennae are always up.  Within less than a month, I have had two guys get really aggressive with me.  One scared the shit out of me.  The other, when I told him, "You are bordering on making me uncomfortable," apologized profusely.  But the fact is, it happened.  It seems like almost every girl I know has a story.  Hearing my friend's story about the other night makes me so angry.  I wish she would file charges.  Maybe the motherfucker would think twice about forcing himself on a woman if it meant not being admitted to the bar.

      Borrowing the link from  urlLink Soup's , be sure to read the story about  urlLink the woman who forged a $1 Million bill .  Several things.    1.  My favorite part of the story is, "A clerk at the store immediately noticed the bill was fake."  Well, ain't that some shit-- recognizing a million dollar bill as a   fake  !  Does this guy get Employee of the Month, or what??  2.  We've got some serious she-maleness going on here.  3.  Also, is that a blossoming mullet we've got going on over there?  4.  My friend Philip's first reaction wasn't, "Who the hell thinks they could pass off a $1 million bill?" but, "Seriously.  What was this lady thinking?  Like any cashier is going to have $998,000 in change."  For some reason, Philip, I'm thinking she didn't take that into consideration.

      Local coffee shop studying and then Chinese dinner w/ Pablo.  After sharing our mutual most appalling date/hook-up stories, we decided that we need to publish a book of worst dates.  One that, when you flip it one way, it's women's stories.  When you turn it over and flip it the other way, it's men's stories.  Given my own experiences, and my girlfriends' experiences, I think we'd have a best seller.  Here's one I feel compelled to share because it's just...  My challenge to you is:  beat this.  Kate was 19 and living in Queens.  She met a hot hot  hot H-O-T  fireman who was 28.  He was a little old for her, admittedly, but, well, insert pun here about fireman being red hot, on fire, smokin, etc. etc.  And, he seemed normal enough.  About two weeks into their relationship, she had set their Friday night date as "The Night."  He picked her up, and took her back to a restaurant by his studio in the Bronx.  After dinner, they went for a walk which ended, fortuitously, in front of his doorstep.  He asked her if she wanted to come up, and of course she said yes.  Up on his floor, they stumbled down a long, narrow hallway, all over each other, and nearly flew through his door.  He flung her down on the bed, and her arms flew out to her sides, spread-eagled.  It was still dark in the apartment-- he hadn't bothered to turn on the lights yet-- but she thought she felt something odd underneath each of her hands.  When she was telling me the story, from the gestures she was making, I was sure it was going to be two other naked ladies, and she had managed to grab two handfuls of plump breast.  "What's...this?" she asked him.  He flipped on the light switch and Kate took a look around.  Stuffed animals.   Everywhere .  Covering the bed.  On the floor.  On shelves.  More on the floor.  Everything in sight was covered in stuffed animals.   Grouped  by kind.  As in, reptilian animals-- like the crocodile and the snake-- in one corner;  aquatic animals next to those;  African animals over in another corner (including a  7-foot tall giraffe ); and so on.  There was a long silence before Kate said, "I didn't know you had a child."  The Fireman realized she'd been eyeing the stuffed animals, looked embarrassed and said, "Oh my god, I can't  believe  I was so  rude !  Let me introduce you to everybody!"  And proceeded to introduce her to every.single.stuffed.animal.he.owned.    "This is Brown Sugar and Mister Maples," he said, pointing to two stuffed bears.  "This is Kate," he said, pointing to her.  Thirty seconds after introductions were over, Kate was out the door and standing by his car.  She says that she was crammed up against the passenger side door during the entire drive from the Bronx back to Queens, staring at him in utter disbelief.  Needless to say, she never saw Brown Sugar or Mister Maples again.

      Blue skies and sun, and a whopping 39 degrees-- this day is looking to be good.    On today's agenda: *  Researching the open brief.  Today I'd like to get all the statutory research-- including a full legislative history work-up-- out of the way.  If I can start with digests and case law, too, that would be fantasmic.  *  Outlining.  *  Office Depot.  I love Office Depot.  I don't even need school supplies this time (okay, well, maybe some hilighters and more Pilot pens).  I do need, however, bubble wrap.  My dad left his toolbox here when he and my mom came up in January.  His entire, 80-lb toolbox.  And now he wants it back.  "Just mail it to me," he said.  "Do you have any idea how expensive that will be?" I asked.  "Just send it in parts, then," he suggested, as if sending it piecemeal will somehow be less expensive.  I think I'm just going to get an assload of bubble wrap, take the toolbox into the UPS store, and be like, "Uh... ship this."  *  Mo' movie watching.  We still have--  American Wedding, Snow Falling on Cedars, and Thirteen.  I think today will be good.

      Talking to a friend from high school today, he noted how funny  urlLink friendster's  emails are:  "Scott is now your friend!" "Adam is now your friend!" "Katie is now your friend!"  "I've known you for 8 years," he said, "But  now  I'm your friend."  As if, how were people friends before Friendster?  Also, in order to avoid an irate comment from  urlLink dwb , I must acknowledge  urlLink orkut's  superiority in every way.  I'm not a member, but I figure acknowledging this may keep dwb from pulling a few hairs out and screaming obscenities at his computer monitor when he reads this post.  Carry on, carry on.

      I spent all day in bed.  Well, except that I showered .  And went to pick up take-out from the Vietnamese place down the street.    I really thought about trying to make it to school.  I mean, I thought about it a  lot .  I'd think to myself, "I'm going to get out of bed now.  I'm going to get out of bed now.  I'm going to get out of bed in five minutes.  I need to go to school and at least get books.  I'm going to get out of bed now."  But instead I would end up playing Snood or adding/searching for  urlLink Friendsters .  I just felt too exhausted to do much of anything but lie around.    I also watched "Unfaithful" and "Matchstick Men."  Last night, Florida and I watched "Under the Tuscan Sun," also with Diane Lane.  So far we're 0 for 3.  Unfaithful was just, meh.  Under the Tuscan Sun started out well.  The first 20 minutes were pretty funny, but then it went downhill, dragging on too long.  Matchstick Men, also pretty meh.  Right now, I am back in bed (hurrah wireless internet), with Lonestar Gato laying on my stomach as I type.  Sweet sweet sleep.  Tomorrow there will be efforts at doing research for the open brief.

      I know this is old news, but read  urlLink this article  about a woman whose defense to vehicular manslaughter is that she was fellating the man driving.  She points to the fact that, when he was thrown from the car, his pants were down.  The best part, by far, is the Assistant State's Attorney's explanation of why the defense was flawed.

      What Florida and boyfriend neglected to tell me on Saturday night was that Red had been deathly ill all this past week, nearly unable to get out of bed because he'd had such a nasty cold.  My head feels like it's about to explode.  I need to do work, but all I feel like doing is laying on the couch.  That's the direction I'm headed in now.  Pablo is coming over at 8 to watch more movies with me and watch me be generally miserable.  I always told people in college-- when you think you're getting sick, drink as much as you can stand to, because the high alcohol level will help kill off germs.  I don't know if this is actually true, but my scientifically unfounded medical advice has never resulted in death or  grave  bodily harm, so I figure it's all good.  However, there comes a point where drinking will only make you sicker.  I have reached that point.  Mmm, couchness.  Curse you, Red!

      And I just remembered that I took two Alka-Seltzer Cold pills.  This might explain why I feel almost drunk after just two drinks.    Note to self:  When it says, "Do not mix with alcohol," on the label of your pills, this might actually mean, "Do not mix with alcohol because two drinks later, you'll have trouble typing."

       Quote of the Night :  "I felt pretty good about the fact that I was walking past bars, feeling kind of drunk, and they weren't even open yet."  -- Frodo, on walking to the grocery store the first time for Guinness around 5 PM  Wow.  Did you ever wake up the next morning, and just find yourself kind of speechless about the night before?  That's how I feel about  all  of last night.  Florida and I went to the grocery store at 2 PM yesterday and splurged on liquor.  I walked out with $160 worth.  I'm not sure how much she spent.  So far, the favorites by far are the Just Desserts Creme Brulee and Chocolate Chip Cookie.  Seriously, try them, they're awesome (just stick 'em in your freezer first, or sip on the rocks).  They both beat Bailey's, hands-down.  Truly tasty.  By 3:30, we were mixing up White Russians.  We called up everybody still in town, and by 4:30, were making pina coladas, gin &amp; tonics, daquiris, and more white russians for the crew.  At 5:50, Frodo made the first round of Irish Car Bombs of the night.  Although all 7 or 8 of us drank that first round, the fact that 3 or 4 people alone went through two 6-packs of Guinness and a bottle of Bailey's helps to explain the rest of the evening, I think.  I stuck mostly to the gin & tonics and white russians, but I know Frodo by himself had 7 car bombs.  The Catholic was passed out cold on our couch by 8.  She'd made herself two gin and tonics in a hi-ball glass that were about 50/50 gin/tonic, maybe more like 60/40.  Combine that with 2 car bombs, and the fact that she might weigh 90 pounds soaking wet, and-- you understand.  The rest of the night...  there's a lot I can't talk about because it simply would be inappropriate.  As to that business, let's just say,  it got rrrreal interesting up in this bitch .  Our new apartment motto just might be, "What happens in this apartment, stays in this apartment."  That's all I'm going to say about that-- there are just certain things that I don't feel comfortable broadcasting about other people.

      Today was the perfect day.  The weather was already beautiful when I woke up at 8:30.  65 degrees, sunny blue skies, no clouds.  I wore my Reefs to school for the first time since October or November.  I only have one class on Fridays, at 11.  I mosied into school around 10, did a few pages of reading, and then sat with the crew in the courtyard, soaking up the sun.  Today just felt relaxed.  It was the beginning of our spring break.  School is always quiet on Fridays, but even more so today, since most people didn't bother coming to class.  After class, 15 or so of us went to lunch-- Mexican.  Fajitas, mango and rasberry margaritas, chips and salsa...  everybody felt good...  everybody was laughing and smiling...  It felt good to know that none of us had anything to do for the rest of the day, or for the next week, for that matter.  We took two hours at lunch, sitting and talking long after we'd paid our bill (the place was emptying out, though, so no worries about screwing a waiter out of more tips).  On the way to the parking lot, we passed a local grocery store, and decided to explore.  That was a good call:  Frodo discovered 24 oz cans of PBR.  He almost started jumping up and down with sheer joy when he saw them sitting in the refrigerator case.  I bought a 24-oz of Smirnoff Black, and a 24-oz of something called Camo.  I only bought it because it's "beer," supposedly, but 9% alcohol, and only like $1.50.  So far, I've been afraid to drink it.  I'm afraid it's going to be like motor oil, albeit alcoholic motor oil.  I hadn't had Smirnoff Black or Ice in a year.  We used to drink it all the time in college.  I didn't realize until today-- that stuff is super shitty.  Man.  Gross.  Probably not as gross as the Camo is going to be, but gross nonetheless.  Because she was bored, Florida rearranged our living room.  Change is good, and I really like the new set-up.  IceQueen came over for a little while, but I left her with Florida to walk over to Dairy Queen for blizzards with Frodo.  Later, at my place, we ordered pizza, drank beer, and watched TV before going over to Blockbuster to get "Lost in Translation" and "Once Upon a Time in Mexico."  I fell asleep while watching the latter.  Today wasn't a busy day, it was just...  perfect.  Today felt  really  good.  Everybody was in a good mood, and relaxed.  There was no tension, no stress.  The weather was beautiful, and driving around with the windows down always makes life good.  Now, I'm going to bed.  On tomorrow's agenda:  sleeping in, making margaritas and daquiris all day, mayhaps doing some school work, mayhaps not.    Life is good.

      I don't know how to descibe the feeling...  when you watch someone move through a room, and you think about all you could give them if they wanted it.  It's thinking, I have so much to offer you, if only you realized.  It's here for the taking.  The girls he surrounds himself with...  they're all... bland, is the word that comes to mind.  They're nice, but minimal on the personality.  But he's political, and so in a way, their blandness is what makes them absolute perfect for him.  They are unlikely to  ever  surprise him or upset that homeostasis that's so important to him.  I've seen firsthand how important it is to him to maintain control of a situation, and how he struggles never to let his guard down.  I, on the other hand...  he knows I could be trouble.  He's seen me angry, he knows that I can get upset.  I start shit with my friends when I'm mad at them.  I emote.  I might not be predictable enough.  I'm too... sparky, likely to ignite.  I'm not  volatile  per se, but I'm not a cardboard personality either.  I'm don't blend into the background well enough to be un-noticeable.  I'm not safe enough.  It'll take time, so indulge me.  It's hard.  I'm working on it.   It's just hard.

      It's interesting how certain songs attach to certain memories.  50 Cent's "In Da Club" always, without fail, reminds me of dancing at Red Fez with Sean.  I always have and always will thought of that moment when I hear that song.  Britney Spears' "Strong Enough" always makes me think of writing a paper on Derrida all night, finally printing it out at 7:30 in the morning.  The same song always makes me think of Thai food, the rice noodles I was reheating throughout the night in order to keep me going.  Korn's "All in the Family" makes me think of driving up to Dallas for OU Weekend my freshman year, with Doug and Eric alternating on the lyrics.  Driving home from the party tonight, I was listening to a mix CD I'd made off of my rap songs.  Fat Joe's "What's Luv?" is the 10th or 11th track.    The memory:  It's my junior year of college, toward the end of the spring semester.  I am currently panicking, thinking that maybe I should go back to pre-med after all.  My parents come down, ostensibly for Honors Day Weekend, really to discuss whether I should spend a 5th year in college, making up the rest of the pre-med classes I need.  They took me out to Ruth Chris Steakhouse for dinner.  I weighed the pros and cons.  Law, medicine.  Medicine, law.  That was a really bad time for me in general, and I was lucky to have people at school that I could lean on to get me through it.  I don't feel comfortable getting into any more detail than that, suffice to say that, even though I wasn't passed out in the bathroom at White Castle, I had pretty much hit rock-bottom.    I brought my left-over steak back to my dorm room.  Was that night Sigma Chi Fight Night?  I'm not sure.  I seem to remember ordering pizza on Fight Night my junior year.  This memory must have been something different.  I'm not sure we even left my boyfriend's dorm room.  Hours later, I ate my leftover steak, and then started the shots of Smirnoff Vanilla.  This night is the reason I no longer do shots of any flavored vodka:  I remember puking up the steak.  I'm convinced there's something in flavoring that makes me puke, now matter how little of it I actually shoot.  But most of all, I remember having my boyfriend at the time put Fat Joe's "What's Luv?" on repeat and bouncing around to it, singing along, forever, in his dorm room.  What's love, it's about us, it's about trust babe...  It sounds bad-- I was depressed and on top of that, I was puking up some of the best steak you'll ever have.    But it's a good memory.

      Tonight should be an interesting night.  D and Frodo are already over.  We just had the following conversation:  Me:  D brought you that beer five minutes ago, and you haven't finished your last one!  Fucking hurry up!  As a matter of fact, when I get back from the kitchen, I think I'm going to have another beer for you. Frodo:  Hey, bring me a cup, too. Me:  Do you want a pint glass, or just a plastic cup? Frodo:  Whatever.  Something that's easy to chug out of.  For an indication of how the night will proceed:  Frodo showed up with a 12-pack of PBR under his arm.  For himself.    We're going to a friend's party.  I'm taking a carafe (yes, you read correctly) of wine ($3.99, baby!!) to the party.  For me.  The friend is making my tried-and-true godless sex orgy trashcan punch.  Only good things can come of that. Contingency plan:  if it blows, D, Frodo, and I will be headed out to the usual spot, the club that offered us drink specials for drawing the law school crowd.  I've already decided that there's a 90% chance of NOT going to Civ Pro tomorrow.

      Con Law is cancelled today...  This is especially good as: *  At 11:30 last night, less than halfway through the reading assignment, I determined that I wasn't going to finish the reading. *  Pursuant to not having finished the reading, I determined that I wasn't going to class.  I hate being unprepared in class, and given that I'm maybe the ONE person he hasn't called on yet, I figure my time is coming.  I definitely don't want him to call on me when I'm not prepared.  Ah, sleeping in until 9.  The weather is shitty out, but this is turning out to be a glorious day...  And I've only been awake for 5 minutes.

      Oral arguments went well.  Very well.  Pursuant to last night's post about 213 Skippy Is No Longer Do in the U.S. Army, here is one thing I Am No Longer Allowed to Do at Law School:  Buy Wine.  I now have 12 (  twelve  ) bottles of wine in the house.  And that's in addition to the 12-pack of Fat Tire and the two 32-oz.ers in the fridge....  and a few bottles from the last 12-pack of Fat Tire.  Florida yelled at me when she got home.  "That's alcohol abuse!  You have a  problem .  Drink your wine!"  I told her, "I  do  have a problem:  it's called sobriety."  Time to crack open a bottle of wine, baby.  Then maybe some Con Law.

Read it, you'll crack up.    My particular favorites are: *  My proper military title is 'Specialist Schwarz,' not 'Princess Anastasia.' *  Not allowed to add, 'In accordance with the prophesy' to the end of answers I give to a question an officer asks me. *  I am not the atheist chaplain. *  May not bring a drag queen to the battalion formal dance. *  I am not authorized to initiate Jihad. *  I am not authorized to change national policy in Eastern Europe. *  The Microsoft Dancing Paperclip is not authorized to countermand any orders. *  Shouting, "Let's do the village!  Let's do the whole fucking village' while out on a mission is bad. *  When detained by MP's, I do not have a right to a strip search.

      I just got back from school.  Yes, I went to the law school at 2 in the morning to turn in my trial brief.  This is actually less insane than you might first think.  Here's why:   I.  I SHOULD TURN MY TRIAL BRIEF IN AT 2 IN THE MORNING  A.  The brief is due at 9 AM. B.  I have class at 10 AM. C.  If I turn my brief in at 9, I will be at school, and hence feel compelled to go to my 10 AM class. D.  Additionally, to turn the brief in at 9, I will have to get up at 7.  That's only 5 hours of sleep. E.  If I am not at school, and hence not feeling compelled to go to my 10 AM class, I can sleep as long as I want. F.  If I'm going to skip my 10-11, I might as well skip (sleep through) my 11-12. G.  If I'm going to miss my morning classes (the only useful ones), there's really no point in going just for 1 PM Crim (which is utterly useless on any day). Conclusion:  Therefore, turning in my brief at 2:30 AM instead of 9:00 AM allows me to sleep longer than I would have otherwise,  and  adds the bonus incentive of not going to any of my classes.   II.  CLASS, SCHMASS  A.  I usually play Snood during the 10 AM class anyway. B.  I usually IM during the 11 AM class. C.  I usually wish I could self-lobotomize during 1 PM Crim. D.  Furthermore, if I wake up at any sort of decent hour, I'll go to school anyway and just do work in the library. E.  It's generally impossible for me to sleep much past 9 anymore.  Therefore, I will likely be productive tomorrow, in spite of skipping class. Conclusion:  Skipping class is A-Okay.  See?  It works for all parties involved (me).  Driving to school, I was stopped at a red light when Local PD pulled up beside me.  They gave me a long hard look, probably wondering, "What the hell is Texas here doing driving around at 2 in the morning?"  I'm guessing it didn't help that I was yelling, "Let the raaaain fall doooown and waaaake my dreeeaaaams!!" at the top of my lungs to the radio (yeah, I'll rock out with Hillary Duff, whatev).  As you can see, however, this post is not titled, "I got arrested on my way to school."  Well  thank god for that .  Oh, also...  I think the winning theme for my brief was, "Mediocrity: It takes a lot less time, and most people won't notice the diffference until it's too late."  Here's hoping for an 87, baby!

      No Con Law ever again.  Until next fall, when I take Con Law II, that is.  Next up is Crim, which is rather unfortunate since  I don't know anything about Criminal Law  at all  .  This utter lack of knowledge may have something to do with any of the following:  *  My rather "sparse" attendance *  My intense hatred for my professor *  My focus on Snood when actually in class *  Did I mention I can't stand my professor? *  Or the book?  Here's hoping I don't get assigned to any of the Criminal Divisions this summer, cuz...  those poor attorneys aren't going to know what hit them (unless, of course, they've heard of the phrase 'disastrous incompetence' before).

      Here is another reason why my current school, although I am a graduate student rather than an undergrad, is lame:  The local news tonight is carrying a story about Sigma Chi hazing its pledges.  The alleged incident?   A video tape of a kid with his head in a bucket of ice-water for 30 seconds .  Oh, sweet Jesus save us from the nerdy undergrads who think  that's  hazing.  At least I learned how to haze properly at UT, and I wasn't even  in  a Greek organization*.  As Pedro noted, "No goats, strippers, or blood.  Pathetic."    -- * for that long.

      If a dead homeless man were sprawled out on our living room floor, I don't think Pittsburgh would ask about it.  During Spring Break, Florida rearranged the living room.  It wasn't that she just moved a couch a few feet from where it had been.  It was that she  completely rearranged the livingroom .  Although Pedro immediately commented on it the next time  he  came over,  Pittsburgh  has never said a word about it.  Absolutely nothing.  After our awful lunch with H and The Boy on Friday, Pedro and I stole a Sig Ep chair and hauled it up to my apartment.  This isn't just any run of the mill chair.  It's made out of plywood, rather large, painted  bright yellow  with green leaves on the arms, and says, "CAMP SIG EP / A PHI" in bright red letters.  We put it in the middle of the living room.  After telling Florida that I had "acquired some new furniture for the house," we decided that when Pittsburgh asked about it, both of us would shrug and say, "I dunno, it was here when I got home."  But Pittsburgh hasn't said a   word   about it.  It's a giant yellow ugly chair in our livingroom, and not a word!  If the situation were different, and I walked in to see this thing sitting in my house, the first sentence out of my mouth would begin with, "What the fuck--?"  Pittsburgh, on the other hand, might not even comment if there were a small Guatamalan family housed in a cardboard shanty in our dining room.  This really has unlimited potential.

      The last day of classes passed uneventfully.  Pedro and I were in the mood to celebrate, and ended up going out to lunch with Florida, The Boy, and H.  Unfortunately, H and The Boy were only in the mood to study.  The vibe at lunch was just terrible.  On one side of the table, H and The Boy babbling on about Lopez and, "Okay, so if you wanted to ban widgets because they were harmful to interstate commerce, could you do it?".  On the other side of the table, Pedro, Florida, and I making half-hearted attempts at normal conversation and subsequently getting dirty looks from The Boy and H.  The two of them nearly flipped out when Pedro, Florida, and I got a pitcher to go with our hamburgers.  I had contemplated staying to study with The Boy and H, but the vibe at lunch irritated me to the extent that I just wanted to leave.  As soon as I threw down some cash to cover my burger & the pitcher, I was out of there.  Note:  finishing your 1L year-- even if you haven't truly "finished" in the sense that finals and the write-on competition are over-- is a big deal.  It's okay to celebrate that fact for  an hour .  Have some perspective, and let yourself enjoy your accomplishment for a little while.   Then  go study.

      It's the last day of 1L classes.  For most people, the last day was yesterday.  I, however, have one more Civ Pro class to attend.  I can't believe we're back here at finals time already.  I guess the good thing is that, having been here once before, I feel like I have my study plan a little more under control.  Except for Crim Law (or, as it should be called, What Larry Doesn't Know a Thing About Law), I feel pretty good going into my Research, Con Law, and Civ Pro exams.  Now it's just time to batten down the hatches and get my finals on.

Our research exam is on Monday, and playing around on  urlLink THOMAS , I found this:     HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO WILLIE VAUGHN -- (House of Representatives - April 20, 2004)  [Page: H2158]  GPO's PDF     (Mr. DAVIS of Illinois asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)      Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, today marks the 100th birthday of my uncle who lives in St. Louis, Missouri; and I guess on May 1 hundreds of my relatives are going to converge on that city to pay tribute to him. So I simply rise to wish a happy birthday to "Uncle Dude,"  as we finally called him. His name is Willie Vaughn. But he has lived a long and productive life. His mind is great. He is still active. Happy birthday to Uncle Dude.     It's part of the Congressional Record from yesterday.  Happy birthday Uncle Dude!

      Well, the article is on the front page of Blogger, but in case you didn't click there, click  urlLink here .  It's a USA Today article about Iraqi bloggers.  I particularly like  urlLink Iraq the Model .  I also like  urlLink A Family in Baghdad .  I bookmarked them both.

      With all the drama and pre-finals preparation going on lately, there hasn't been much to post.  Several observations: 1.  I am now living in either a really bad Lifetime movie or a soap opera.  All I need is either a friend who has an eating disorder or who is being abused by a significant other.  2.  Our first final is Monday.  Oh fuck.

      Next week is our last week of classes.  I can't believe it-- 1L classes are over.  Almost.  Today was spent: *  Skipping civ pro to eat lunch and go to Best Buy with Pedro and Soup.  *  Buying Kill Bill Vol. 1, Reservoir Dogs, and Pulp Fiction for a grand total of $35.00. *  Watching part of Kill Bill before I started feeling guilty, went back to the library, and playing  urlLink Topsy Turvy .  Topsy Turvey seems to have been made for two year olds.  However, this doesn't mean  I  can get past Level 7.  I die every time.  *  Watching the BarBri Crim Law Review video.  By which I mean, playing "Would you rather sleep with X or Y?" with Pedro and IceQueen online.  This meant bursting out in uncontrollable fits of laughter at several points during the video.  I'm sure the people around us didn't appreciate it.  Now I know for sure who to send IceQueen and Pedro home with, though.  Point of Extreme Irritation:  Somehow, the wire that goes from the phone line to our DSL modem has been cut.  As in, it looks as if someone used a razor to slice it.  I have no idea what happened, except that it was fine when I left today at 4:30 and not fine when I came home at 9:30.  Aside from the normal irritation this would cause, it is even MORE irritating because we register for classes tomorrow at 7:30 AM.  Right now, I am poaching off another wireless network in our building, but it keeps dropping my connection.  Because I have no stable connection to the internet, I will have to be AT school at 7:30 to register.  Suckness.

      I turned in my final brief for Legal Writing at 4 this morning.  Waiting for the elevator to reach the 5th floor, where my professor's office is, I felt just a little bit giddy.    I am done with Legal Writing  .  We still have a cumulative final in Legal Research (don't even get me started on what total bullshit I think this is), but there are no more Research  or  Writing classes.  This is the beginning of the end, baby.  2L, here I come.

      3 drunk dials from The Marine and  urlLink dwb  as they were partying together in DC.  Good effort, boys.  Hope ya'll had a car bomb for me.  I had a spectacular night bonding with my couch.  It's odd how, because I have so little free time generally, small mundane things become extremely enjoyable.  Painting my toe nails, for instance, has become a cause for celebration.  I practically jump for joy if I can spend twenty minutes browsing a bookstore (even though, back in the day, I could spend hours in bookstores).  Watching TV on my couch all night long?  A pretty good Friday night.  The rest of the weekend will be spent working on the brief.  We had our final legal writing class last week (*tear*), and the brief is due Monday.  I really liked legal writing, despite the frustrations of trying to learn new formats.  What surprises me is that I got a shockingly better grade on my first trial brief than I did  any  of my memos.  Apparently, objective writing is a little bit harder for me.  I'm more used to persuasive writing, anyway.  It seems to flow a bit more naturally.  Another factor might just be memo formats-- I'm just haven't written enough memos yet to feel totally at ease with them.  Maybe I'll get some practice with it this summer, we'll see.  For now, it's time for the weekly call to the parents, and then some brief-writing.

      Done.  The brief ain't purdy, but it's a little better than decent.  This is the first time in nearly two years that I've pulled an all-nighter doing schoolwork.

      So  urlLink Venturpreneur , whom I believe is a prof over at University of Wisconsin law, is having some law school blog popularity contest.  Reference: 1.  His  urlLink first post  about his favorite law school blogs.  I'm not one of the favorites, but I did get a mention for making "every law student who isn't" at my school "grateful to be somewhere else."  And I suddenly became a male.  But that's neither here nor there.  2.  His  urlLink second post , incorporating a poll where you can vote for who you think should be added to the Honor Roll.  You can vote for yours truly if you like.  What surprised me is that I only read one of the other listed blogs, and that's  urlLink DG .  I nominated  urlLink BuffaloWings&amp;Vodka .  Out of all the listed blogs, I would definitely add him to the honor roll.  I'm about to go back and nominate  urlLink Soup  as well.  At any rate, even if you feel a bit ridiculous about something like this, it might be a way to discover law school blogs you haven't read before.  I'll be checking out a couple on the list.  For now, it's back to the brief.  Exigent circumstances?  Inextricably intertwined with Fourth Amendment analysis?  What?  Se habla espanol?

      When I wrote about  urlLink our little visit to a strip club , I left out one thing...  Now, I'm going to  urlLink quote myself here , and repeat what I said before:  If you're going to put your vagina in my face, I don't think it's fair to kick me.    I could get over a simple stripper-kicking, if that were the end of it.  But the problem, really, isn't that it ended up not being so much of a stripper-kicking as a Stripper Related Injury.  When she kicked me, she clipped my cheek with the (sharp) heel of her go-go boot, and took a chunk out of my face.  I woke up the next morning, and (per usual) wondered, "Well, what the hell happened here?"  Slowly, it came back to me:  Somewhere in between putting her hands on my boobs and trying to stuff my hands down her g-string, she   kicked me in the face  .  It scabbed, looking like a  ginormous  popped zit gone horribly, horribly wrong.  But I was careful to keep Neosporin on it, hoping that it wouldn't scar.  Bad news:  It scarred.  It's not big, and it's not some horrible gash, but it is a pink spot on my left cheek.  Aside from purely aesthetic concerns, this might not be so terrible, except imagine the following:   Partner :  How'd you get that scar on your left cheek?  Chicken pox?  Larry :  D'aahh... I'd rather not talk about it?  Partner :  Now my interest is piqued.  How'd you get it?  Larry :  [long pause]  A stripper kicked me in the face.  Partner : [even longer pause]  You're fired.  Moral of the Story:  When you get kicked by a stripper, kick her right back.  At least you'll feel better when your SRI scars.  Or gives you a nasty case of facial gonorrhea.

As to points A &amp; C, evidence this morning:  I am sitting at my desk, reading the NY Times online.  Lonestar Gato charges into the room, runs up to my chair, bites my arm, and then immediately charges back out of the room.  There is a reason I am always armed with a spray bottle when I'm at home.

      Disturbing sight in Women's bathroom:  Empty Ding-Dong wrapper sitting on top of a stall's toilet paper dispenser.   Why this is disturbing :  1.  People generally don't take food into bathroom stalls with them.  We have a shelf in our women's bathrooms, and people usually leave their books/backpacks/purses/coats/ Ding-Dong's  on that.  2.  Why would you take an empty wrapper into a bathroom stall?  Wouldn't you just throw it out on your way to the stall?  This leaves only one conclusion:    Someone was eating a Ding-Dong in the bathroom stall  .  Does this strike anyone else as odd, possibly   insane  ??  It's like going sock shoe, sock shoe, instead of sock sock, shoe shoe.    Who does that  ??

      Hopefully, we have concluded this trash with Mr. Army and the Journal.  Speculation abounded this weekend as to whether Prof. Con Law would address the fiasco in class today, as we haven't had class since Mr. Army sent out his first public email last Wednesday.  PCL deftly avoided a discussion of said scandal, obliquely referencing it only once (which elicited chuckles and some sidelong glances at Mr. Army).  Conclusions: *  Thank god.  It's pretty ridiculous that something like this goes on in the first place.  *  I've settled on the fact that we will never know the full story.  I don't really  disbelieve  Mr. Army's last email, but I also don't believe that an editor-in-chief of a journal would stoop to kicking someone out of the write-on competition.

      May it please the Court,  I present to you the latest installment in  Journal Scandal 2004  (make sure you say it with a booming, echoing voice, it's better that way).  If you aren't caught up on our on-going saga, I suggest the following background reading:  1.   urlLink The Original Incident  between Mr. Army, Editor-in-Chief, Prof. Con Law, and subsequently  the entire school . 2.   urlLink Mr. Army's Response  to Editor-in-Chief's comments.  The latest in our installment is almost too good to be true.  Color me skeptical.  Mr. Army has wisened up (somewhat-- I use that phrase in an  extremely  narrow manner), and sent this email to only a handful of people, including:  My roommate Pittsburgh (who happily forwarded it to me), a smattering of the people in my section,  Professor Con Law , and   all the writing professors  .  Enjoy.  And, if you're like me, please remember to pick your jaw up off the floor when you get done reading Editor-in-Chief's alleged comments.     From : Mr. Army  Date : April 2, 2004 7:50:46 PM CST  Subject : The JOURNAL HAS GONE MADD!!!!!  Dear FELLOWS:  Unlike my last email, I am not sending this to the entire school.  Just to some of you I happen to know because you're in one or more of my classes, or because I hang out with you.  [Editor-in-Chief], you remember, . . . sent out the "open letter to Mr. Army."   Today he emailed me again and said, "Mr. Army, we still need to meet" to talk about my email in Defense of Prof. Con Law's comments.  I wrote him back to say that it seemed fairly odd to me that we "need" to talk about anything.  This was his response. (And mine is below it.) No I am not making this up.  And the only reason I'm sending it is that some of you might find it interesting if you are planning to preference Journal.   Mr. Army : We still "need" to talk?  This is an interesting take on it.  I've never addressed you personally in any email (much less another forum), other than when I responded to an email you sent me.  I'm at a loss to understand what you "need" to talk to me about.   I'm married, I work (part-time), and I obviously have all the same time commitments as other first years.  If you can tell me what exactly you "need" to me talk to me about I can meet you Monday morning, at school, at around 8 a.m.  Mr. Army.   Editor-in-Chief : You got it.  See you at 8 am.  Monday.  Room 113A.  And you better cool it with that lip, son, and learn some respect,   or you're never going to get reinstated in the writing competition  . ( Emphasis added -- Larry )   Mr. Army : 'And you better cool it with that lip, son, and learn some respect, or you're never going to get reinstated in the writing competition.'  Oh, my heavens!!  Please, by all means take my name off promptly.  Is that what you "needed" to talk to me about?! Where are you from?!!  I mean this is more than comical.  I'm was never %100 sure on participating in any case.  But this, M. Mano's email...I mean, holy shit.  This has really sealed the deal. How old are you two?  Have you ever worked?  Have you ever been told maybe you're not the most important person in the world?  You do realize there are thousands of scholarly journals published all over America, Canada and Western Europe, don't you?  You do realize that besides the numerous scholarly journals that aren't related to the law, there are also something like 185 ABA law schools that also have their own reviews?    There is no way on God's green earth I would participate in anything run by a person who says something like, "cool it with that lip, son, and learn some respect."  I mean, I have to ask again, where are you from?!! This is beyond ludicrous.    If this is what you planned on talking to me about, let me save you the trouble.  My Lord!  This is truly insane.  Mr. Army."     Give me a moment to, once again, pick my jaw up off the floor.    Several Notes: 1.  I'm sorry, but did Mr. Army allege that Editor-in-Chief has threatened to  blackball him from the school's journals in a supposedly anonymously-judged write-on competition ???  2.  This is getting  ugly , folks.  3.  Why didn't they meet at high noon?  Or behind the school gym?  Can I get a piece of the action?  Or at least beat someone up and take their lunch money?  4.  Color me skeptical.  There must be part of the story that Mr. Army is leaving out of his emails to the rest of us.  I don't know Editor-in-Chief personally, but everything I've heard about him paints a picture of a really nice guy.  I can't imagine he would compromise himself by emailing Mr. Army-- who is already known for his rather loose emailing of personal discussions to  the entire school -- and threatening to blackball him from the write-on.  On the other hand, while I have often made fun of Mr. Army, he also strikes me as a fairly scrupulous, impassioned individual.  Just as I have trouble believing that Editor-in-Chief would threaten Mr. Army, I have trouble believing that Mr. Army would fabricate such a story.  Leave points out, mayhaps.  But fabricate the entire story?  The kid may be a bit misguided, but he's generally well-intentioned and, like I said, scrupulous.  Stay tuned in for further installments of Journal Scandal 2004.  -- *  And I promise from here on out to STOP using exlamation points in my titles.  But seriously, stuff's been exclamation-worthy lately.

      At the office I'm working at this summer, in order to get an outside line, you have to dial:  9+1+pause+number.  This means that if you are dialing long distance or a 1-800 number, you end up dialing 91+pause+1.  Everybody who has been in the office awhile knows about the pause.  The interns, however, do not.  The phones also function as a type of PA-- they have an automatic speaker function whenever something needs to be announced office-wide.  Usually, it's stuff like, "John Doe, please call Jane Doe," or "So-and-so, you have a visitor in the lobby."  Today, over a period of about fifteen minutes, the announcements were flying fast and furious:  "This is a reminder that to dial out of the office, you dial 9, 1, then  pause , then your number.  Repeat, 9, 1,  pause , then your number.  We have been getting calls from the Fire Department because someone is dialing 911."  [2 minutes pass]  "Please do not dial 911 unless there is an emergency.  We are getting more calls from the Fire Department because someone is dialing 911.  If you would like to dial outside the building, please  pause  after dialing 9 and 1 so that you do not call the Fire Department."  [1 minute passes]  "Again, we would like to remind everyone that you need to pause between 9, 1, and the next digit of your number when dialing out."  [3 or 4 minutes pass.  I start thinking the person must have figured it out.  Nope.  This time, you can hear the irritation in the announcer's voice.  She's still polite, but there's a definite edge there.]  "Once. More.   Please pause  after dialing 9, 1.  We are still receiving calls from the Fire Department that someone is dialing 911.   Please pause ."  [Another 3 or 4 minutes pass.]  The announcer comes on once again, saying the same thing.  Someone is still dialing 911.  The attorney I'm working with walks by my conference room and says, "Could ya stop dialing 911, Larry?"  I told him, "Hey, if I want to call the cops, I think that's my business, okay?"  I said this just as the announcer pipes up  again .    After that, it was sweet silence.  Either the person trying to dial out gave up, figured it out, or died because they really were trying to call 911, and our office kept telling the 911 operators that it was an accident.  I haven't had to make a call out yet, but I can't wait for my own turn to dial the Fire Department.  I think I learned a valuable lesson today:  We law students may seem all smart n' stuff, but we can't be trusted with the simplest of tasks, including using a telephone.  Keep that in mind the next time you hire a lawyer.

      I am taking a calculator to work tomorrow.  "But wait," you say, "I thought lawyers, and by extension law students, didn't do math?"  You're right.  They don't.  The problem:  I need to calculate a likely settlement demand from the other party.  This would be cool if we were talking about, say, X numbers of working hours lost at $Y/hr.  Instead, we're talking about X numbers of hours at one job, possible loss of overtime (which has to be calculated at a different rate than the previous item), the fact that this person then SWITCHED jobs, which included a switch in pay per hour, and the question of whether the switch would have happened but for retaliation they're suing on.  On top of that, there are damages for possible emotional distress, medical damages for possible work-related stress-induced ailments, lawyer's fees, and a whole host of other compensatory damages.  Now, if you know me at all, you know that I add single-digit numbers and that's about it.  Enter the calculator.  I usually only use my calculator to divide our phone and electric bills by 3 to figure out what amount each of us should write a check for.  Let's hope it doesn't explode tomorrow when I try using it for my settlement memo.  Wish me luck.  If I'm working at Burger King on Friday, you'll know what happened.

      I have a whole conference room to turn into my own little office.  My assignment right now is to write up an analysis of settlement options for a retaliatory discrimination case.  This means reading through several tubs of material today and tomorrow, hopefully drafting my memo on Wednesday, and presenting it on Thursday.  There is a 70% chance that we will go to trial in mid-June and an even better chance that I will second chair.  I was feeling pretty smart today, reading brief after brief and order after order about this and that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure.  Hell yeah I know what a 12(b)(1) motion is, biotch.  I might have almost fallen asleep, but whatev.  There's more to write about, but right now I just want to crash.

      First real day of work for The Man.    Relatives are gone (thank god).  Parents are gone.    Life will normalize sometime soon.  In other news, Soup somehow made it out of Texas alive.  I thought we were going to have to write him an epitaph, "Here lies Soup / B.A.C. of 1.9."  I received a drunk dial from him at two in the morning Saturday, followed by a drunken text message around 4:30.  Good work, my friend.  Good work.  Must iron and get gussied up.  A Willie Nelson Whiskey River t-shirt is appropriate business attire, is it not?

      As some of you may know,  urlLink Soup  is trying  urlLink Texas on for size  this weekend.  Waylon Jennings once said, "Ain't no way to understand how that border crossin feelin makes a fool out of a man."  He was talking about Mexico, but I think it might apply to Texas as well.  Which would certainly explain the following text message, received from Soup at  2:08 AM this morning :  "I might be a pimp.  Not sure, but it's certainly possible."  Some responding this morning elicited further information:  "All I know is that I karaoked 'Hot in Here' at the Ballpark [in Arlington] Bar, and had Texas women loving me."  I should have known Soup was going to be a public menace down there.   --- Bonus points to anybody who knows the Waylon song.

      1.  I started workin for The Man today.  The attorney I'll be working with is a deadhead, has a picture of Bob Dylan in his office, and is vegan.  Are you surprised to know that he does mostly environmental and criminal environmental litigation?  2.  Aunt + Uncle + 2 small children came into town today.  How can I put this delicately?  Oh wait, I can't:  I don't like small children.  I also don't like it when relatives invite themselves, and then in response to any idea of things to do, automatically say, "No.  I don't want to do that," and then look at me expectantly.  This is especially so because I've put some research effort into these ideas.  Lady, I don't know much about this city except where to get totally wasted, but I've tried to look into things we can do with kids, that the whole family would enjoy, not just one drunk law student.  If you summarily veto all my ideas, hey, I'm going to run out eventually, and neither of us will be happy.  3.  I got my Con Law grade back.  Haha!!  They're putting me in Speshul Ed Law next semester.  But hey, I'm cool with that, I hear we get to color our casebooks.  4.  zzz...

      My parents are in town.  Other relatives are coming in Friday...  I like my parents being in town, but I am not looking forward to these other people coming in on Friday.  I know they really want to see me, but... even the thought of it (2 maniacally overbearing parents plus their two small children plus my parents and other assortment of relatives already here) just makes me tired.  I start work on Monday, and I'm worried that I'm going to be exhausted.  Not much else to talk about, just wanted to note that I am still alive.  Time to hit the Ben and Jerry's.

      DG  urlLink posts  on whether law school was really as bad as she thought it would be.  I feel like I should be up front about two things:    1.  I am a big nerd.  Despite my dislike of some of my  classes  I have never been bored by the  material  this year.  I liked Civ Pro and Property, both notoriously boring classes.  In fact, on the scale of interestingness, Crim Law definitely ranked lowest.  Below Research and Writing, even.  2.  I worked my ass off in undergrad.  I took challenging classes and worked long hard hours.  I pushed myself.  What I notice about many of my classmates here is that they really slacked in college.  College for them was basically one four year-long bender interrupted occasionally by class.  That's fine, except that many people find they now have real work to do, and not only that, it's not particularly interesting work for most people.  Why be up front about those things?  Because I love law school.    I don't always love all things about law school, but generally it's been a great experience for me.  However, I don't think this is fortuitous, or necessarily a result of where I go to school.  I think it's because I'm used to studying a lot and it probably wouldn't take much more than a blank sheet of paper to pique my interest.  I generally enjoy what I spend most of my time doing here, that is, reading and otherwise studying.  It's speculation on my part, but I think some of the people who really think law school is miserable feel this way because (a) they cannot motivate themselves to be interested in what can sometimes be very dry, technical material;  (b) they are not used to studying a lot, or even at all;  (c) they are now competing directly with a large group of people who all want to succeed;  (d) by definition, in law school not everybody can be at the top of the class;  and (e) suddenly the stakes are extremely high, with summer and permanent job placement, salary, and general options for the near future all riding on academics.  There are other ways to improve your experience, of course, some of which DG mentions.  For example, avoid users or stress-bunnies.  I have one classmate who only talks to me when she wants to figure out what I'm doing so she can compare it to what she's doing.  She flat-out ignores me otherwise.  Now, I try to avoid her when assignments are due or during the exam period because I don't feel like playing Keeping Up with the Joneses with her, and doing so only irritates me.  I also tend to avoid people who make coffee nervous.  Law school is a high pressure environment without people who are so stressed out that you can see their teeth rattling.  Once you figure out what irritates your or stresses you out, don't associate yourself with people exhibiting those characteristics (another personal example is that I am super-irritated by whining and complaining, so I have cut down my contact with the Constant Whiners).    I also have a couple of really close friends that I trust.  Socially, this year has been full of ups and downs, with the end result being that I trust far fewer people than I did even in December, but I'm glad to have made a handful of really close friends.  You will, at some point, need a support network.  Aside from that, you need people to booze with, which brings me to my next point.  Generally, it's been my experience that when people aren't working really hard in law school, they're binge drinking.  In fact, a visiting Pre-L told me that a co-1L had told him, "Yeah, if you aren't into drinking, you probably won't have much to do here."  Fortunately for that particular PreL, he liked the sauce.  If you don't, hopefully you've developed some other hobbies or time-fillers, because the bulk of your classmates are likely going to be drinking heavily in their spare time.  On another social note, realize that the pressures of law school sometimes do funny things to people, including you.  If you spend a lot of time with your classmates, which most of us do, you'll find that people who, in the Outside World, would seem perfectly nice to you become the bane of your existence and the scourge of the earth.  The law school environment makes glaringly obvious annoying habits and personality nuances (good and bad).  The only thing I can really say about that is to try to remember that the person you can't stand now may be pimping your resume for a lateral hire in a few years, or sending clients your way.  Or not.  Over lunch with an attorney here in town who graduated from my school, she told me that one of her classmates also works at her firm.  Every time she sees him, she thinks about what an asshole he was in law school.  It wasn't even that he did anything particularly to her, just that he wasn't very...  nice .  It's been more than ten years, and she still remembers.  I don't know if she's unique in that regard or not, but I get the impression that she might not be.  That's enough rambling for now.  I need to get back to work on my Comment for the writing competition.    Long story short:  law school is way better than I expected it to be.

      Another  urlLink law school blogger from Texas .  I have no lawyers, guns, or money-- can I send something else?  Like cheddar cheese-flavored popcorn or an empty Gatorade bottle (the most sendable items on my desk right now)?  Random and only slightly related to the above by a discombobulated thought process:  There's a Spanish proverb that translates, "Praise God and pass the ammunition."  In law school I believe that translates into, "Praise the Curve and pass the Emanuel's."

      Footnotes are in every way  urlLink utterly superior  to endnotes.  This just in, though:  Did you know that if you double-click on the endnote number, Word will toggle you back and forth between the text and the note?   Sweet .  Thanks to Soup for clueing me in on this before I'd pulled (more of) my hair out.

      I know this is rather late in coming, but if anybody is interested,  urlLink SCOTUSblog  recently  urlLink posted  linking to the transcripts of the oral arguments before the Supreme Court in  urlLink Hamdi  and  urlLink Padilla .  Read  urlLink  Ex Parte Quirin  , 317 U.S. 1 (1942), if you haven't.  Another "enemy combatants" case is  urlLink  Johnson v. Eisentrager  , 339 U.S. 763 (1950), although I don't think it's discussed in oral arguments because it's easily distinguishable (non-citizens and admitted enemy combatants captured and tried in China after the war had ended).  It does have a nice discussion of a sort of sliding scale of rights for aliens in the U.S, though.  Anyway, the reason I'm linking to all of this stuff, besides the fact that we spent a lot of time talking about it in my Con Law class, is that I think if the Court doesn't find for Padilla and Hamdi*, the masses might view it as unquestioning deference and allegiance to Bushzilla.  It's not necessarily that-- there's at least some sort of precedent.  Whether or not the Court chooses to distinguish the present cases from that precedent is another question.  Enjoy the reading, it's back to the Comment for me.   -- *  My personal prediction is for Padilla and against Hamdi.

      I'm listening to the radio while working on my Case Comment for the write-on.  They are broadcasting from a bar located a block from my house.  It's college night.  They have dollar pitchers.  There are "beautiful people everywhere."    Contrast:  I am sitting in my room, glasses on, squinting at various stacks of people and my Bluebook.  I am completely sober.  There are no beautiful people located in the immediate vicinity (Florida and I are both looking pretty disheveled, and we're not even sure that our third roommate, Pittsburgh, lives here anymore).  My head kind of hurts and rather than write another endnote, I'm contemplating sleep.  Right now it's taking a major effort to focus on something other than the drunken meat-market down the street from my house.  I miss you, bar!  My life will not be normal until June-ish.  And by that, I mean, "I won't be stumbling around in a drunken stupor in the middle of a week-long bender" until June-ish.  I only hope I have the strength to make it that long.

      Florida and I like to think of the most obnoxious gunneresque things to say.  Gunners inspire us.  For example, before finals started one of our classmates (who, incidentally, has taken to bragging about his high IQ lately) told a group of people, "Oh, I'm done studying.  I'm just going to take it easy before finals, maybe do a practice exam or two."  All during finals, Florida and I would tell each other, "Um, actually?  I finished studying already.  Yeah, I'm just going to hang out, do some lines off a stripper, maybe do a practice exam.  I don't know-- I don't know if I'll actually have time."  "Well, actually, Larry, I finished studying last year.  I've just been hanging out in 1L classes this year because I'm so brilliant."  The writing competition is ripe for gunneresque obnoxiousness.  Which explains the very  urlLink Wings and Vodka -like conversation we had last night over IM:   Florida :  Have you started writing?   Me :  I did the bluebooking thing.   Florida :  Me too.  I'll start writing on Sunday night around 2am.   Me :  Awesome!   Florida :  Actually, Larry, I'm done with my paper.  I worked on it all day yesterday and today.  I just didn't want to seem dorky.   Me :  Oh, whatEVER, Florida, I finished mine on Saturday night after they handed it out.  It's perfect in every way.   Florida :  I actually made law review already.   Me :  I made it last year.  I was born on law review.  I have a birthmark in the shape of "Law Quarterly."   Florida :  I'm hoping to get on Rally's Journal of Law and French Fries.   Me :  Florida, I don't want to crush your dreams or anything, but maybe you should reconsider and preference the Dairy Queen Daily.

      Soup recently brought you  urlLink fun with District Judge Kent .  Today, I would like to bring you  United States ex rel. Mayo v. Satan and His Staff , 54 F.R.D. 282 (W.D. Pa. 1971).    [Plaintiff] alleges that Satan has on numerous occasions caused plaintiff misery and unwarranted threats, against the will of the plaintiff, that Satan has placed deliberate obstacles in his path and has cuased plaintiff's downfall.  Plaintiff alleges that by reason of these acts Satan has deprived him of his constitutional rights.  We feel that the application to file and proceed in forma pauperis must be denied.  Even if plantiff's complaint reveals a prima facie recital of the infrincement of the civil rights of a citizen of the United States, the Court has serious doubts that the complaint reveals a cause of action upon which relief can be granted by the court.  We question whether plaintiff may obtain personal jurisdictino over the defendant in this judicial district.  The complaint contains no allegation of residence in this district.  While the official reports disclose no case where this defendant has appeared as defendant there is an unofficial account of a trial in New Hampshire where this defendant filed an action of mortgage forecloseure as plaintiff.  The defendant in that action was represented by the preeminent advocate of that day, and raise the defense that the plaintiff was a foreign prince with no standing to sue in an American Court.  This defense was overcome by overwhelming evidence to the contrary.  Whether or not this would raise an estoppel in the present case we are unable to determine at this time.  If such action were to be allowed we would also face the question of whether it may be maintained as a class action.  It appears to meet the requirements of Fed. R. of Civ. P. 23 that the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable, there are questions of law and fact common to the class, and the claims of the representative party is typical of the claims of the class.  We cannot now determine if the representative party will fairly protect the interests of the class.  We note that the plaintiff has failed to include with his complaint the required form of instructions for the United States Marshal for directions as to service of process.  For the foregoing reasons we must exercise our discretion to refuse the prayer of plaintiff to proceed . . .      -- *  Bonus points for the first person to say what motions Satan and His Staff should make under the Federal Rules... [Oh, Civil Procedure, it's a sickness]

      Where am I?  What has Blogger done?  Why is everything so... tan??  This will definitely take some getting used to, although it does appear that Blogger has made some significant improvements.  Update:  Forthcoming.  Real soon now.  Aside from working on the Writing Competition, nothing much has been going on.  We've been watching a lot of movies.   Mean Girls :  Way better than I expected.  Florida and I are buying it when it comes out on DVD.  Jonathan Bennett?   So hot, it's not even funny .  Florida, Paki, and I may have missed the point though:  far from making us want to be nicer people, I think the movie made us aspire to be the law school Mean Girls.  None of us has two Fendi purses and a silver Lexus, though, so I guess we'll just have to dream.   Fargo :  Fell asleep watching this with Pedro and Florida, watched it again with Florida.  Hm.  Don't really know what to say about it.  Probably won't watch it again, but I guess I'm glad I saw it?   Matrix Revolutions :  So bad we Florida and I turned it off after half an hour (the same thing happened about two weeks ago with Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear's  Stuck on You ).  I don't know what was going on, and I really don't care.  Boring.   Love, Actually :  This was really good.  Favorite quote--  "Colin, you're an ugly, lonely asshole.  You must just accept that."  "No.  I'm Colin, God of Sex.  I'm just on the wrong continent."  [Colin and Friend discussing Colin's plan to move from England to the United States so he can get laid.]  Back to the writing competition.  I've decided that when I get some time (probably at the end of May, when the writing competition is over and my parents + assortment of relatives leave) I'm going to post my advice/information for 1Ls.  Any suggestions?   urlLink Email me .

      Well, I was officially done with my 1L year at 4:30 Thursday afternoon.  Pedro, Florida, and I popped two bottle of champagne in the courtyard as soon as we'd uploaded our exam files, and commenced with the celebrating.  Everybody was giddy--  how in the hell did we make it this far?  I am still in disbelief.  There are certain things that always seem to be so far in the distant future that it seems truly unreal when you actually attain them.  Being at law school in the first place was like that--  very surreal at first, and took some serious getting used to.  I couldn't believe that I was actually  here .  As for actually finishing my grueling 1L year?  It still hasn't completely sunken in (although a drunken stupor quickly did).  There was an open bar Thurs night and last night, both of which I attended.  Here's an indicator of what a sad state of affairs I'm in:  I felt pretty awful all day yesterday due to a nasty hangover.  Getting ready to go out to the 2nd open bar, I opened up a Fat Tire and within 5 minutes was feeling brand new.  I'm feeling pretty decent today, all things considered.  I think this might be because, despite having 7 or 8 gin and tonics last night, they were light on the gin and heavy on the tonic.  The writing competition started today.  They're charging us $25/each to participate in 10 days of shittiness.  The packet is 358 pages long containing both the material for the Comment and the material for the Bluebooking exercise.  I will probably be posting here as distraction over the next 10 days (but, you ask yourself, how can she possibly tear herself away from the Bluebook?????).  Wish me luck making it onto one of the journals.

      At this time tomorrow, I will be less than half an hour away from the end of my 1L year.  I will also be less than half an hour away from never looking at another Federal Rule of Civl Procedure (though I expect I'll become quite familiar with  urlLink Rule 11(c)  during my practice).  Two days and then the write-on competition starts on Saturday.  Ends on the 17th.  My parents are arriving on the 18th.  Other relatives are arriving on the 21st.  Work orientation on the 21st.  Parents, assorted other relatives leave on the 23rd.  Start work on the 24th.  Yup, it's going to be a busy May.

      I'd heard that Sudafed + Red Bull worked a lot like Ritalin or Adderol.  I'm not sure how it even came up last night as Florida, Pedro, and I were studying, but it did.  We were planning on renting a movie, studying until 9:30 or 10:00, then watching our movie;  the sketch grocery store is next to the Blockbuster;  suddenly, trying Red Bull + Sudafed seemed like a good idea.  I've never tried Ritalin or Adderol before, and perhaps this was just an exercise in futility, seeing as Adderol is so easy to get.  But here is what I do know:  *  It took -forever- to kick in.  As in, several hours.  I think this might have been because we were using 24-hour Sudafed.  *  "I feel tingly...   in my head !"  -- Pedro  *  Although I went to bed at 1, I was awake until 3 and woke up at 6 unable to go back to sleep.  I have a suspicion that I'm going to feel like ass later today.  *  Don't chew Sudafed.  [This was Pedro's mistake, not mine.   Florida :  What are you guys doing in there?   Pedro :  Eating drugs!].  Because it tastes like shit.  *   Stuck on You  with Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear is possibly the worst. movie. ever.  I thought it would be stupid-funny in the same vein as Zoolander.  Nope, it's not even funny.  We didn't even get halfway through it because it was so painful.  Anyway, it's 6:30 and I'm not going back to sleep any time soon, so I guess it's off to school to study for Crim.  Hurrah felony murder . . .

      Too busy.  Am writing a brief to the Court of Appeals, but keep getting sidetracked by other stuff.  Example:  today got hauled into doing some other intern's cite check.  I didn't mind, but the fact that I didn't get as much accomplished on the brief as I had wanted to makes me feel a little stressed out.  I'll take it as a compliment, though, that when the division chief needed an extra hand, she asked for me (I assume, against all odds, that the following didn't take place--   Division Chief :  I need somebody to cite check.  Which intern isn't doing anything important?   My attorney :  Pff, Larry sure isn't.   Division Chief :  Hallelujah.  Get her down here pronto.).  Further example:  Tomorrow I am working on what has been vaguely described as "a motion" written by an agency attorney.  Some of you might have heard what happened the last time my assignment dealt with something written by an agency attorney.  It was not pretty.*  Maybe it was just one bad apple, but man, when I heard that it was coming from that agency, I just cringed on the inside.  Let's cross our fingers.  Other news:  I saw Shrek 2 tonight.  This may be surprising, but the soundtrack is awesometacular.  Mmm, must download (even if that persnickety  urlLink Fitz-Hume won't ).  I liked the first Shrek better, if only because a lot of the jokes were fairy tale satire.  There's still fairy tale satire, but a lot of contemporary stuff, too... like making fun of Justin Timberlake.  My kids will think Shrek is funny.  They probably won't get a lot of the jokes in Shrek 2.   However , it was still good.  I enjoyed muhself.  Other other news:  I had the turkey artichoke panini from Panera today, and it was  so so so so so so so so so so so so  good.  I dare say I enjoyed it maybe even more than  urlLink someone else  enjoys diet coke.  It was that good.  Must...have....another one....right....now.  Or maybe tomorrow for lunch.  Mmm.  Tastastic.   Time to sleep.  May your sleep be filled with large paninis.    -- *  Not pretty:  synonym for, "Larry got about 50 feet from the building after work and had a total meltdown."

      One of the attorneys in our office recently handled a fraud case against a husband and wife duo.  She reported the following:  1.  A motion for the wife to have access to her "special chair" while in the court room.  Result:  Granted.   The wife is extremely obese, and post-motion the U.S. Marshals hauled in a  double-wide Lazy Boy .  This house of a woman propped herself up with five or six pillows in her  double-wide Lazy Boy , and continued to constantly readjust the pillows behind her head during the entire trial.  2.  A motion for the wife to be able to eat while in court.  Result:  Granted. Because she's so grossly obese, the wife has blood sugar problems.  Rather than handle this problem with glucose or insulin, the court allowed her to bring in a bag of food to court every day so that she could  constantly eat .  According to our attorney, she would pull out anything from Pringles to sandwhiches to  fried chicken  to Doritos, and just crunch and munch away while everybody else in the court room tried to ignore it.  3.  A motion for the husband to sit with his back to everyone in the court room (facing the wall) because he had  uncontrollable smirking .  Result:  Granted. That one might be a bit self-explanatory.  Sitting next to his wife, he would turn his chair around and face the wall while the trial proceeded because he claimed he had a problem with  uncontrollable smirking  and didn't want it to affect the outcome of the trial.  So, picture this in a serious courtroom trial context: A.  Giant whale-sized woman sitting in   double-wide Lazy Boy   instead of a regular chair, B.  While eating Doritos or fried chicken, and C.  With her husband sitting next to her with his back to the court because he can't control his smirking.  I don't know how I would have been able to keep a straight face.  Pass the chips, biatch.

      Saturday morning, I dreamt that a friend down in Texas was referring possible cases to me.  He told me about one case in which a judge had denied class certification.    After he told me a little bit more about the case, I busted out with, " Good .  That just should have denied class cert.  There's absolutely no typicality.  And in a 23(b)(3) class . . . . " and went on to say something else I don't remember.  And I was totally indignant that the plaintiff had even tried to get class certification, as there was such an obvious lack of typicality.  First semester, I used to dream about property all the time, especially toward the beginning.  I think it's considered going downhill, though, to dream about Civil Procedure, of all things, well over two months  after  school is out.

      News flash:  If you work at one of the biggest law firms in town that  everybody  knows the name of, and you're making $2000/wk,   don't   answer the question, "Where are you working this summer?" with, "Oh, a law firm downtown."  This prompts the other party to ask, "Oh?  Which one?"  Thinking that because you haven't named it, it must be a smaller or mid-size firm.  When you respond with the name of the law firm, which is basically the same as saying, "Oh, you know, the 400-attorney firm where I'm making buckets of money, having lunches with partners everyday, and generally living la vida rica," you look like  a total asshole .  The Boy does this,  particularly  when speaking to people whom he knows are working for Legal Services or otherwise for free.  I want to hit him in the head with a brick.  Someone else did it tonight at a networking event, though it didn't come off half as snotty as when The Boy does it.  Still.  Get a grip, gunners.

      Crisis at work:  our printer is out of toner.  Now might be an appropriate point to quote Michael Bolton:  "PC Load Letter??  The fuck does that mean???"  You might think that toner wouldn't be a big deal.  You would be wrong.  We've been out since Friday.  Usually the interns print out at least a ream or two of paper every day.  I hate reading cases online-- I need a hardcopy.  We told someone that the toner was out.  He said that they had to "order some."  This office has printers all over the damn place.  How can there not be a single toner refill in the entire office?  And ordering toner?  How long will that take?  This is a major problem.  I finished my motion to dismiss &amp; brief in support.  Now I'm working on writing a brief to our Court of Appeals.  Yet I can't print out any cases.  Ugh.  I hate staring at the computer screen all day.  Also:  some people get carpal tunnel from typing.  I've got some sort of carpal-slash-hand-strain on my pinky and ring fingers of my right hand from flipping the corners of papers back and forth.  Seriously.

      Yesterday, we had three hours of firearms classroom instruction, and then almost four hours of practice on the shooting range.  Our instructor does fire arms training for local police departments, the Air Force, the Marine Corps, and a variety of other groups.  He's ranked in the top 100 shooters in the nation, and is state champ of several different states.  I shot: *  A variety of pistols.  Thoughts:  I don't really have enough muscle to shoot 25 rounds without my finger getting dead tired on a pistol...  the triggers had to be pulled a bit more and with a bit more force than the semis.  The fact that the pistols were heavier than the semis didn't help either.  My aim was nearly perfect until I started getting tired, and that's when I'd start hitting things two or three inches from where I was aiming.  *  9mm semi-automatics.  Thoughts:  Semis are, according to the instructors, less accurate than pistols.  Maybe so, but I was more accurate with the semis over a longer period of time because they were lighter and I didn't have to pull the trigger as hard to get them to fire.  My arms and index finger didn't tire so quickly, so I retained my accuracy.  Also, because the semis are a little smaller, they are a better fit for me, I think.  *  .40 police semi-automatic.  Thoughts:  A second instructor, a member of one of the local PDs, came out to help at the shooting range.  After awhile, he handed me the gun he had on him and let me shoot a few rounds with it.  It had a flashlight attached to the gun beneath the barrel.  Almost made me wish I was kicking in doors at night and shootin' stuff up.  I was ready to go get my SWAT on.  *  A .44 magnum.  Thoughts:  Which you might know as Dirty Harry's gun.  I only shot one round, though, just to say that I'd shot a .44 magum.  The kick was pretty incredible and my aim with this gun was horrible.  The backs of my legs are so sunburnt from standing with my back to the sun for four hours.  I look like a lobster, and bending my knees is really unpleasant.  However, it was totally worth it.  I've only shot guns once before, and I just didn't really feel that comfortable.  The classroom training yesterday, on the other hand, made me feel very prepared and safe, and our time at the shooting range was conducted in a very methodical manner to keep everyone safe and having a good time.  After a little bit of warm-up, I was hitting 1.5-inch targets from 15-20 feet away.  Let's just say that there is a paper man out there with a lot of holes in him.  Good times.

      Or at least scare the shite out of.  Yours truly, Ms. Larry the Longhorn, was the best shot out there today, besides the instructors.  Yeah, that's right, what's up, biatch(es)?  That was some square bidness right thur, I tell you what.  I had a great time, although the backs of my legs are so so so sunburnt.  It's not going to be fun wearing hose on Monday.

      5:20 AM:  Time for which my alarm was set this morning.  7:00 AM:  Time I was supposed to leave my house.  7:45 AM:  Time I was supposed to meet B.Dyl at work to leave for final pre-trial conference.  9:15 AM:  Pre-Trial conference at district court.  9:50 AM:  Time I actually woke up, looked at the clock, and yelled, "No, no, no, NO!"   Wow.  I don't know that I've ever felt much worse than I do right now.  People who know me, especially people who might have known me in college, know how uncharacteristic it is of me to be late, or to just  not show up  for something.  I am so anal-retentive about time, and being on time, that it led to fights with boyfriends in college.  I get near-anxiety attacks if I think I might not be on time to something.  I don't know what happened this morning.  I just do not know.  I have never in my life turned off my alarm without realizing it.  It's possible Lonestar Gato, knocking around my room at night, could have pushed the off button by stepping on my alarm, but even that seems unlikely.  The most likely scenario is that, although I set the time last night, I neglected to actually turn my alarm on.  Which, again, is utterly uncharacteristic of me.  The last time I was late to something was nearly three years ago when I had a biology final exam at 9:30 AM and woke up at 9:20.  As soon as I woke up, I called B.Dyl's office and left a message-- which I'm not really sure was non-rambling or coherent.  I just sent him an email telling him that I'm going to a change of plea at 1:30*, but that after that I could come to the office and start working on a new project if he would like me to (and, of course, apologizing again).    The shitty thing is, B.Dyl will probably be really nice about it.  I'm sure he's furious, but he will probably be very nice to me.  Which will make me feel worse.  I'd rather get yelled at, sent home, and then start tomorrow feeling as if we've moved on.  I hate that this happened at the beginning of the summer, because B.Dyl doesn't know me, and this is still sort of like a test period to see what I can handle, and what I'm like.  I've just shown that I'm irresponsible and cannot be trusted...   but that's NOT me  at all , and anybody who knows me  knows  that.  Ugh.  I want to vomit.  Or crawl in a hole.    -- *  I've been in court all week, not with B.Dyl but just generally.  The office gives us each a week at court with whatever atty from our office is there so that we can get some exposure to the courtroom.  This week, I've seen multiple sentencings, revocation hearings, changes of plea, relevant conduct hearings, and other such things.  Yesterday, I helped put on evidence at a relevant conduct hearing.

      Last semester, #1 in the class got drunk at Barristers, bragged to a bunch of people about her class rank, but didn't remember it.  That got the gossip mill churning, and pretty soon everybody knew she was #1.  She didn't know how, though, and thought that CSO had been telling people.  She threw a temper tantrum in front of her section and mine because some random person came up to her and congratulated her on being #1.  She was enraged that CSO was telling someone her rank.  Her temper tantrum only escalated the gossip mill, because it only confirmed what everybody had been whispering.  Then she found out that  she  had been the one to leak it.  That's not really my speed.  If I were #1 in the class, I'd make myself a t-shirt that had "#1" on the front and, "SUCK IT, BITCHES" on the back.  That would be my uniform for the rest of the semester.  Why go through the trouble of getting outrageously drunk, throwing temper tantrums, and causing scenes when you could just make a t-shirt instead?

      Grades were due yesterday.  Because my crim law professor wanted me to despise her even more than I already do (who knew it was possible), her grades weren't in until today.  Crim finally came in late this afternoon.  This just in:  I made my lowest law school grade  ever  in Crim Law.  Something about me &amp; Crim just never clicked.  This is okay, though, since I did really well in Con Law and Civ Pro.  I'm not retaking Crim Law next year, and my GPA this semester improved over last semester's.  In my book, it's all good.  I'm kind of glad we're out of school for the summer now, because grades time last semester is when some people went absolutely nuts.  And by nuts, I mean even more neurotic and annoying than they already were.  This semester might be even worse because a lot of people are going to have dashed hopes when they find out they didn't do as well as they did last semester.  For instance, one of our friends discovered yesterday that he had dropped from the top 25% last semester to likely outside the top third of the class this semester (our school doesn't release GPA cut-offs for below the top third).  It might make me a bad friend, but despite the fact that I feel sorry for him, I'm kind of glad that I don't have to see him in school every day right now.  I'm just not sure I could handle it.  We have to submit our first bids for Fall OCI by July 1, I think.  That's scary.  Additionally, I have to start doing more research on Texas firms.  There are three or four firms with offices in TX that are "participating" in OCI.  On closer inspection, I discovered that they're not even coming to our campus-- they're just doing a resume collect.  F that.  I need some interviews.  This fall is going to be craaaazyyyyyy...  and it's all starting now.  Meh.  I want to go back to sleep.

       urlLink DG  recently  urlLink asked  what Presidents and Assholes is.  I'll give the barebones outline of the game as I know it.  Local rules tend to vary quite a bit.  Presidents and Assholes is a drinking game played with cards.  Deal out the whole deck (minus jokers) to your players.  The person with the 3 of Spades starts.  From there, you go clockwise for the first round.  The next person has to play a card of equal or higher worth than the one played previous.  If equal, the next player is skipped and they must drink.  Every time you are skipped, you must drink.  If you don't have a higher card, you must drink.  2 clears and the person who lays the 2 can put down another starter card. 4 is a social card, meaning everybody drinks, and it's as if no card was played at all (the next card must be of equal or higher value to the card played before the 4).  The person out of cards first becomes the President.   They play the first card in every round that they are President.  Additionally, they get to make a new rule for the succeeding rounds  Mine, for instance, was that everybody had to take 1 drink every time an even-numbered card was played.  Another girl's rule was that we had to refer to her only as Princess.  ShortyJ's rule was that every time we referred to each other by name, we had to take a drink.  Other people have been known to require nudity as punishment (reward?) for playing certain cards, requiring everybody to drink when someone says drink/drank/drunk, and requiring someone to drink if they use the words me/you/I.  The person out of cards last becomes the Asshole.  They deal cards and clear when 2s are played.  While dealing, they can make rules just for while cards are being dealt, and order others to do certain things (like drink).  This comes with a caveat, though, that when dealing is over, Asshole loses his power, and becomes subservient to everyone else.  This is a hierarchical game-- usually, everybody rearranges their seats from first to last out of cards.  You can boss around anybody who was out of cards after you.  This includes ordering them to drink, remove articles of clothing, call you Poopaloop, etc.  From there, you just get wasted.  There can be strategy involved, and there are rules about playing double cards that I'm not mentioning b/c those are the ones that tend to vary most by local rules.  Clear?  If no, do a google search.  I'd be interested in hearing other people's rules as President...

      Last Night's Order of Degeneration: 1.  Presidents and Assholes 2.  Never Have I Ever 3.  Truth or Dare 4.  Dare or... Dare  If you haven't played Truth or Dare with your law school friends, well...   don't .  I did and saw things done last night that no person should do or see done in front of future coworkers.  Or even friends, for that matter.  I'm under a vow of silence, so I won't say what happened, but man.  When ShortyJ said she wanted a few people to come over and play drinking games, I had  no idea  what I was signing myself up for.  Additionally, last night I tried  urlLink Pyramid's Apricot Ale .  It's decent-- at least better than I thought it would be-- but not ideal when you're in for a night of drinking games.  Have a sixer of Apricot Ale, mix with a few Cranberry Vodkas (w/ rasberry-flavored vodka), and pretty soon all that flavoring will be making you feel mighty ill (the  urlLink Ciroc  probably didn't help either).  I should have just stuck with my usual  urlLink Fat Tire .  Good times.

      I ran in  urlLink Race for the Cure  this weekend.  I haven't done Race for the Cure since I was in high school, or maybe even earlier.  It's been awhile.  I'm glad I did it this weekend...  It was a very good experience.  There were  so many  people there.  It felt pretty empowering, and everybody seemed to be very in the spirit.  It was kind of scary, though...  the number of pink shirts (survivors), "In Celebration of" signs (more survivors), and "In Memory of" signs was frightening.  Almost every single person there had a "In Celebration of / In Memory of" sign pinned to their shirt with the names of at least two or three people written.  It seems like everybody knows one or more women who have had breast cancer.  I know of at least three professors at the Law School that have had it.  One was just diagnosed this spring.  I ran with one of the girls I'm working with this summer, but I think most of the other law students teamed up with the med school and its affiliated cancer center.  They got cool team t-shirts.  My work buddy and I were the Unofficial Team Work*.  We didn't have cool team t-shirts, but we represented nonetheless.  Out of all the goodies the sponsors were giving away, my catch of the day was my new pink shoelaces from New Balance.  Hurrah, pink!!  Anyway, I highly recommend that you use the above link to Race for the Cure and sign up for a race near you.  It's a lot of fun, and although it's one of the most expensive races I've ever registered for ($18), it's for a good cause.    -- *  Because of some of the stuff I post here, I'm more than a little reluctant to say where I work.

      Let me ask you all if this argument, in bare bones outline form, makes sense.  Advice is appreciated.  Background:  P files a 93-page Complaint with 305 paragraphs (some of which have up to  17 subparagraphs ).  He attaches 47 exhibits which total about 400 pages.  Some of the defendants listed on the caption on the Notice of Filing are different than those listed on the caption on the Complaint.  In a section entitled "Preliminary Statement," he names another person in one of his counts, but doesn't specify if they're a defendant.  In his section entitled "Parties," P doesn't mention several people that are in the caption or "Preliminary Statement."  There are 6 counts, but it's hard to tell who all the defendants  are  (as in what role they played), let alone who he's accusing of what.  In the counts, he'll refer to Defendant, Defendant s , sometimes seem as if he's directing the count against a single person, sometimes against all the Ds...  Basically, the complaint is a huge mess.  Additionally, motions to strike are disfavored in our circuit unless the extraneous information is prejudicial.  There might be an argument that the information is prejudicial, but I haven't done any research on how this circuit defines prejudicial information and if our case is similar enough to warrant striking the complaint.  I'm looking into a motion for definite statement, but right now it seems like B.Dyl* wants a Rule 8 argument.  There is another case in our circuit that states that dismissing a complaint might be a better solution than granting a motion for a more definite statement because it generates less paperwork just to dismiss.  So here's the argument...  I.   P's complaint fails to meet Rule 8(a)'s fair notice requirement.  *  “A pleading which sets forth a claim for relief . . . shall contain . . . a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief. . . .”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2).  *  The Federal Rules permit notice pleading.  *  Rule 8 is interrelated and is construed together with the other federal rules.  *  “In the complaint the title of the action shall include the names of all the parties.”  FED. R. CIV. P. 10(a).  “Each claim founded upon a separate transaction or occurrence . . . shall be stated in a separate count . . . whenever a separation facilitates the clear presentation of the matters set forth.”  FED. R. CIV. P. 10(b).  *  “For failure of the plaintiff . . . to comply with these rules . . . a defendant may move for dismissal of an action or of any claim against the defendant.”  FED. R. CIV. P. 41(b).  *  P's noncompliance with Rule 10 is inextricably intertwined with his failure to give fair notice.  *  (Insert stuff here about not being sure who the D's are, and what each is accused of)  *  P's failure to comply with Rule 10, as well as the prolixity and disorganization of his complaint, make indiscernible the defendants and the various allegations which might apply to them as individuals or as a group.  *  When a document is so disorganized that it could not alert either the district judge or the D's to the principle contested matters, it should be dismissed.  *  When a complaint fails to give fair notice as to who the D's are and for what they are sued, it cannot be construed as doing substantial justice, FED. R. CIV. P. 8(f), and should be dismissed.    II.   Even if P's complaint gives fair notice, it is an egregious violation of the short and plain statement requirement of Rule 8(a).   *  While dismissal of a complaint one-fourth the lenght of P's might be inappropriate, dismissal of a 98-page prolix complaint is wholly justified.  *  The short and plain requirement of Rule 8(a) applies to all cases, and has been held to be violated by needlessly long, repetitious, or confused complaints.   *  When a complaint is dimissed pursuant to Rule 8, orginarily it will be with leave to replead.  Permission to file an amended complaint complying with Rule 8(a)(2) is usually freely given because the federal rule contemplate a decision on the merits rather than a final resolution on the basis of technicalities.  *  Our circuit has consistently emphasized the propriety of dismissing excessively long complaints under Rule 8(a).  *  Additionally, our circuit continues to express its aproval of other Courts of Appeal dismissals of excessively long complaints.  *  P's 93-page complaint is an egregious violation of the short &amp; plain requirement of Rule 8(a) and should be dismissed with leave to amend.  Conclusion:  Dismiss this garbage.  Although courts generally give pro se plaintiffs** more leeway, such Ps aren't excused from following the federal rules (according to circuit precedent).  He didn't follow the rules, and it's unfair to burden us and the court with this garbled, unintelligible, and prolix complaint.  Makes sense, yes/no?    -- *  B.Dyl is the attorney I'm working for.  I call him B.Dyl because he  loves  Bob Dylan. ** He's not a prisoner.  He's just some guy who had a year of law school, failed out, and now is suing some people.

       urlLink Whoops .  Just be glad I didn't get happy drunk fingers Monday night.  That would have been more than ideal.   dwb's parents :  Who's that on the phone?  dwb :  Larry.  dwb's parents :  Oh, how is she doing?  dwb :  Given that I can smell the liquor through the phone?  And I can't understand a word she's saying because she's babbling incoherently and slurring while doing so?  She's fine.  Yup, that would have been one migh-T  fine  drunk dial.  There's always next $4 Martini Monday, I guess.  Better turn that ringer off, because Larry's got martini fingers!

      I get Friday off b/c of Reagan.  Good.  I don't know how you people handle this working five days a week thing.  Maybe it would help if I weren't out carousing every night, only getting a few hours of sleep.  I bet I'd feel less assy then.  Today was extremely productive, all things considered.  I'm writing a brief in support of a motion to dismiss under Rule 8(a).  See what happens when you send us a  93-page  complaint?  [Pages:  93.  Paragraphs:  305.  Statement of Facts:  53 pages.  Counts:  5.  Coherency:  0.]  Yeah, and I might write a motion to strike and a motion for a more definite statement.  I call it...   the shotgun approach .    No, I'm just kidding.  But I did write a motion and most of a brief today.  Huzzah!  When I got home, I did a little laundry, cleaned my room for the first time in months, and cleaned my bathroom.  That's more than I've done in a long time, seeing as the past few nights, I've just gone out and boozed it up.  Highlight of the night:  Reno 911 season premiere.  It wasn't very good, but damn I love that show.  I was laughing out loud.  Keep fightin the good fight, kids.

      As my father says, "It's a new day, the sun is shining."  As I say, "I drank 3/4 of a bottle of orange Pedialyte last night."  It was kind of unnecessary to drink that much, I guess.  I'm actually kind of pissed that I'm going to have to buy a new bottle before we go out tonight.  Hassle.  Last night, we met a bunch of people at a local bar for $4 Martini Mondays.  It's become something of a tradition.  I was offered a job as a cocktail waitress at another local bar, because one of our law school acquaintances manages the place.  I'm going to that bar tonight, just to check it out and see if I'd be interested in working there.  After Martini Monday at Jimmy's, Florida, an ex-hookup of mine, and V (an Indian guy that JoJo and Florida are trying to make a future hookup of mine) hung out at the ex-hookup's place for awhile drinking wine before Florida and I came home.  At home, Florida and I talked (mostly) about my intimacy issues, why I have to stop refusing to date anyone (because that's what I've done this entire year-- absolutely refused to really see anyone seriously), why I have to give people (boys) a chance, and why I shouldn't stress at work (um because I'm not getting paid).  Good times.  The rasbertinis and white chocolatinis aren't making me feel too snazzy today, but it was worth it.

      What a wasted day.  Or a wasted weekend, at any rate.  I didn't make it out of bed until 3:30 yesterday afternoon.  All I did last night was paint.  A friend from high school called-- he's in town, and was something of a super-star here when he was in undergrad-- but I just didn't have it in me to go out.  Today was more painting and even more loafing around.  All the while, I have this Respondent's Return to basically rewrite.  It also appears as if the agency attorney who first wrote it might have, um,  gotten the law wrong .  So I'm supposed to figure out what the law is, rewrite the return, and have it ready by, oh, tomorrow, when it's due with the court.  Guess I'll get on that.

      Okay, people, it's Boot Camp for Binge Drinkers.  I don't want to hear anymore  urlLink horror stories  about binge drinking gone awry.    Because I'm such a philanthropist, I'll share with you the Golden Rule of Binge Drinking.    Always have a bottle of  urlLink Pedialyte  in the fridge.    You can find it on the baby aisle of the grocery store.  I usually buy the cheap in-store brand.  Absolutely never ever buy the unflavored kind.  It's gross.  I highly recommend grape or orange.  Anyway, drink it when you get home, before you go to bed.  Obviously, you don't need too much if you haven't had that much alcohol.  But for serious binge drinking, have at least half a bottle of Pedialyte before you go to sleep.  Drink more if you can stand it.  Have some good drunk sleep, wake up the next day feeling golden.  Get in the habit of doing it even when you only drink a little.  That way, when you're so wasted you can't even see straight, you'll auto-pilot straight to the refrigerator when you get home.   Happy boozing!!

      Happy day!  Reno 911 marathon tonight.  I  love  that show.  If you haven't seen it before, seriously, tune in to Comedy Central.  It's absolutely hilarious.  Of note:  I painted my toes hot pink.  Hot pink toes rock.  I heart them.  Last night:  Wooo...   urlLink dwb  got more than a few drunk dials from me.  I walked in the door at 6:30 and didn't even bother saying hi to Florida.  All I said was, "Let's booze, bitch!"  We drank two bottles of wine, a pitcher of pina coladas, and a few beers before heading out.  After stopping at her boyfriend's house and meeting up with some other people, we ended up at the local combination bowling alley / bar.  It's actually a pretty swanky place.  And who wouldn't want to combine bowling alleys with bars?    I woke up this morning with a pretty wicked headache, but then went back to sleep until 3:30.  I drank almost an entire bottle of  urlLink Pedialyte  last night, so no real hangover today.  Back to my Reno 911 marathon.

       urlLink Everybody's doing it , so here's my  urlLink BTQ -esque post.   What I Am Doing at Work :  I finished up the settlement memo last week.  I'm not really sure what's going to be done with it-- if my attorney's going to show it to the Boss or what.  Today, I finished writing profiles of the witnesses we have yet to depose, as well as drafting deposition questions.  Tomorrow, I am editing a Respondents' Return on a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.  There have been rumors about a brief in the future, but we'll see.   What I Am Doing at Home :  Not a whole lot.  I've taken up painting.  Not the walls-- canvas and acrylics.  I'm not any good, but it gives me something to do.  Supplies were surprisingly inexpensive.  Did you know you can get a 24x36" primed canvas for like 6 bucks?   What I Am Reading :   urlLink The Future of Freedom  by Fareed Zakaria and  urlLink The Economist .   What I Am Watching Right Now :  Scream 2.   What I Am Thinking About :  The case on my PowerBook cracked right by the hinge.  I need to get it fixed because, although it's been several weeks, now my power cord isn't staying in so well...  Because it's a laptop, that could be something of a problem.  Not having my laptop for a few days is going to be a pain in the ass.  I have a Dell laptop w/ wireless, but...  all my stuff is on this one.  Ugh.  I am no longer Thinking About This.   Movie I'm Dying to See :  Dodgeball.  I love stupid movies.  I'm buying Starsky &amp; Hutch when it comes out.  And I might buy Zoolander sometime soon.   What Lonestar Gato Is Doing Right Now :  Sleeping on his back on my bed.   Haha, Stupid Men :  I walked out of the dry cleaner's today and saw a traffic cop writing me a ticket for not putting any money in the parking meter.  I thought, "Well, this might be a little awkward."  I walked up to my car, called out, "So you caught me, huh?" in a nice Texas accent, flashed him a big smile, and tossed my dry cleaning in the back seat.  He paused, smiled back, and then tore up my ticket.

      How is it Wednesday already?  Damn.  I flew back to Texas Friday night.  I almost cried when my plane landed-- thank god for the Republic.  I had an awesome weekend, but the kind of unfortunate thing is that to describe it in detail to anybody who didn't go to my high school doesn't make very much sense.  You kind of need to know the people involved.  Saturday was my 5 Year High School Reunion.  Everybody told me that 5 Years suck because it's still so cliquey and nobody really mixes.    I mixed-- I mixed it the fuck up is what I did.  Only two of my friends from high school went to the reunion.  I ended up doing shots all night long with people I  never  hung out with in high school.  I went to school with some of these people for 15 years (private school), I haven't seen any of them since the day we graduated, and somehow I end up at the Spieg's house, killing a bottle of  urlLink Herradura .  It was a blast.  See?  It doesn't make sense because you don't know who the people are.   Sunday was hungover plus ArtFest (Dallas' art festival) and movie night with the fam.  Monday, I met an ex for lunch (also hadn't seen him since the day we graduated in 1999) and flew home.  It was an awesome weekend.  It was great to be back in Texas.  Not so great to be back here in the Midwest.  M is for Midwest...  and Mediocre.

      Saw  The Manchurian Candidate  last night.  I thought Liam Schreiber was very good (I like him anyway), Meryl Streep was awful (too over the top, too much over-acting), and Denzel was fine.  The movie was a mix of good/bad editing, with the good outweighing the bad.  The TV broadcasts in the movie were too unrealistic stylistically.  However, there are some parallel scenes that you go back and forth between, and the editing there was great.  They did a great job of building tension, and it did get scary at parts:  There were definitely points where I was watching the movie through a small sliver between my fingers.  There was a huge creepiness-factor.  It was long (over 2 hours), but didn't feel long.  I give it a B+.

      Nice drunk dial from  urlLink dwb .  Did I catch a, "You should return the favor in an expedient manner, you fucking law schooL BRAT!!!" in there?  Unfortunately, since I'm going back to Texas on Monday and I've got a lot to get done before then, I won't be getting drunk anytime soon (including the two weeks I'm actually going to be  in  Texas).  However, as soon as I return,  urlLink dwb  can expect a "you fucking PhD BRAT!!" voicemail from my inebriated ass.  There also was a rather nice  urlLink dwb commentary, precipitated by the law school brat remark, about how I portray a dual image on my blog of party-girl-slash-person-who-cares-about-her-grades-and-class-standing.  I refer you to  urlLink Larry's Guide to Law School  (also entitled, "Pimpin Is Tax Free" for obvious reasons).  Work hard and play hard, I say.  If you're all work and no play, you're going to have a heart attack by the time you're 30.  If you're all play and no work, you're going to be living under a bridge by the time you're 25.*^    Florida and I were talking last night about the people at the top of our class.  Most of them really do work incredibly hard.  Most of them do absolutely nothing but study (I know of two in the top 5 who seem to have decent social lives).  They don't go out-- they're busy studying.  They eat, sleep, and study.  Study ma-chines.  I guess I could do that, but I think I'd be really unhappy.  I'm not willing to sacrifice that much in order to be higher up in the class rankings.  I spend my fair share of time in the library, but damn-- I need some fresh air and contact with other humans.  I'm not #1 in the class, and things are looking just peachy for me post-graduation.  My goal from now to graduation is simply to maintain the status quo.  Improving would be fine, but I'm pretty happy with where I'm at.  Conclusion:  Do your work and then getchyo play on!    -- *  Unless you have a trust fund, that is.  In which case, party on, Wayne. ^  And this is still not unequivocally true.  There are plenty of people who get shitty grades in law school, but are doing fine five years out.  In fact, my guess is that if you graduate from a top-ranked law school, you're going to be doing fine no matter what.  Unless you really mess up.

      Well it's about that time of year when Pre-Ls are combing the web, looking for any sort of advice about law school.  Here's the Larry the Longhorn Guide to Law School.  Oh yeah, and just because I give this advice does not mean I actually follow it.  *  Get a grip.  Your life does not end because you are in law school.  We were talking recently about partying and boozing, and someone said, "Well, some people want to do well in law school, so they don't do that stuff."  Umm, I party and I've done just fine.  I will not be living under a bridge after graduation.  So party away, uptight nerds.   *  Make friends.  I know some people who have no friends because they think books and grades are more important.  They're wrong, and I think it's sad.  I wouldn't want to graduate and have every single other person in my class go, "Who?"  That would be lonely and miserable.  Don't suck.    *  Work hard.  You only get one shot-- better make it count.  *  Get the goods from 2Ls and 3Ls at the beginning of the school year.  For instance, my friends and I found out from 2Ls & 3Ls that our property professor's class was an extended version of  urlLink a particular hornbook  and that our torts professor took her multiple choice questions from Emmanuel's.  That kind of info is handy.  *  Love your  urlLink Bluebook .  Make friends with it.  Worship it.  Especially worship the Index.  It holds all the answers to your questions.    *  Don't be afraid of study guides.  Getchyo Emmanuel's on.  *  Ladies, keep an extra pair of hose in your locker or car.    *  Speaking of hose, wear nude hose.  *  FYI:  At the beginning of the year, going to meetings hosted by student organizations means free food.  By October, you may never want to eat pizza again, but at least it's free!  *  Boys, the bottom of your tie should hit exactly the middle of your belt buckle.  I didn't know this before.   urlLink Soup  told me.  Now it annoys me to see ties that aren't the right length.  *  Take advantage of the social events organized by the school.  Go to the happy hours.  Go to the alumni mixers.  Sometimes these events can start out very painfully.  If this is expected, have a glass of wine or two before you go.  You never know, though.  At one alumni networking mixer, the attorneys got  sloshed .  Maybe not exactly professional, but definitely hilarious and worth going to.    *  Your grade is (likely) not based on class participation.  So shut up.  And don't be afraid to show up to class drunk.  *  But you probably shouldn't  seem  drunk while in class.  *  Pedialyte is your new best friend.  *  Friday happy hours start at noon or whenever you get out class, whichever comes first.  What I really mean by that is, Friday happy hours start at noon.   Impression Management   So big, it gets its own section.    Look, law school can be a rough place.  It's basically high school with higher stakes, more booze, more drugs, and more sex.  The gossip and backstabbing can be intense and has been known to get nasty.  It helps, however, if you don't give people a reason.  I'm not saying that you shouldn't live your life, but try not to be a douche about it.  The next few tips all involve how not to be a d-bag.  As you can see, they mostly involve what not to do.  *  A lot of impression management revolves around  urlLink saving face .  That's not the best definition, but basically it means being sensitive to, and not exacerbating, other people's insecurities, concerns, feelings, etc.  *  Don't brag to people about your LSAT score.  *  Don't brag to people about your GPA.  *  Don't tell people that with your LSAT score, you could have gone for HLS.    *  Especially don't tell complete strangers that you are guaranteed to be in the top 10% because of your high ______ (fill in the blank here with:  LSAT score, GPA, IQ, capacity to make others want to kill you).  You aren't guaranteed anything but to be in the top 5% most hated people in your class.  *  Being self-deprecating, if you're funny about it, can help diffuse some tension and help people not view you as an asshole.  *  Don't screw other people.  And I don't mean sexually (although hey, you might not want to be a rampaging slut, either).  I mean that even if you don't particularly like someone, try to avoid screwing them over, being horrible to them, etc.  First, you all have to live with each other, and law school is hard enough as it is.  Second, you never know what connections someone might make, and what will come back to haunt you.  There are certain people in my class who I will never, never recommend clients to because of the horrible way they've treated other people in law school.  In fact, I might raise an eyebrow and imply disapproval if someone mentioned to me that they were represented by XYZ.    *  Bother to find out who you can trust.  Don't be indiscriminate in who you tell what.  That is, it's best not to bitch about how many "Thank you for the job offer, but I have to turn it down" letters you need to write in the next week to a group of fifteen people in the commons when A) you don't know many of those fifteen people well to begin with and B) you are surrounded by lots of other people going about their day who are only too-happy to listen to your conversation and then bitch about it later to someone else.  *  That being said, don't bitch in public about how many rejection letters you have to write to big firms.    *  Don't complain about how you have so little free time because you are so busy interviewing with firms that want to pay you $2000/week+.  *  Don't tell classmates that black people don't go to Texas or that people who take public interest jobs were at the bottom of the class (#1 and editor of Kentucky Fried Quarterly of class 2002 is working at Legal Aid).  Oh hey, and don't suck.  *  Don't play Flashcards in the middle of the Commons, annoying anything with two brain cells around you.  Flashcards aren't  that  much fun, and if you think they are, you need to please go away.  *  Don't IM five people at the same time, using the exact same sweet talk, asking what grade they got in the class you all take together.  *  When submitting resumes to firms for fall OCI, don't tell other people that certain firms aren't good enough for you, since you're in the top 10%.  I'll tell you what  would  be good for you-- a brick to the face.    Larry's Number One Law School Rule :  Drink through.

      1.  Saw   urlLink Napoleon Dynamite  , starring Jon Heder.  Although he looks  urlLink pretty hideous  in the movie, he is actually  urlLink hot .  I'll take one, please.  The movie overall was slow.  There were some pretty funny parts where we laughed outloud, but overall the plot was too nonexistent.  Halfway through, I looked at my watch and thought, "When is this damn thing going to be over?"  2.  Saw   urlLink American Splendor  .  Not much to say about that.  Didn't dislike it, didn't really like it.  Overall reaction:  Meh.  3.  Worked on response to motion for contempt.  4.  Saw   urlLink Bourne Supremacy  .  Everybody else with me seemed to like it and think it was pretty good.  Unfortunately, I was passed out for about 75% of it.  The 25% I wasn't passed out for just confused me--  we were sitting in the 2nd row, and I was wrecked out of my mind.  It was all moving too fast for me to really understand.  I kept thinking, "I bet if we were sitting further back, I'd be able to tell what in the hell is going on."  I bet I would have liked it.  If, you know, I hadn't been passed out.  Guess I'll have to check it out when it comes out on DVD.  5.  Went to classmate's party, went out afterward to local bar.  Made serious effort at taking advantage of the "Pay $5 and all your drinks are paid for until 1 AM" offer.  We arrived at 12:30.  Between the two of us, Pedro and I polished off 12 drinks in twenty-five minutes.  It was a pretty solid effort.  The G&Ts didn't have much G in them, so it's not as bad as it sounds that I had 6 drinks.    6.  Currently sitting on couch.  Working on "advice for 1Ls" post.  I'll have to finish it anouther day, though.  I have to be at work at 7AM sharp tomorrow, which means I'm going to bed soon.

      Uh, well.  This week has been positively shit-tay.  Monday was just a huge clusterfuck.  There's really no other way to describe it.  It was a Capital-C-Clusterfuck.  The rest of the week hasn't been much better, except that I actually ate lunch today (first time in two weeks or so, I think).  Tomorrow and Monday will likely be relatively horrible.  Oh well.

I'm proud of her, and definitely happy for her (I know she hated it here... she really wanted to be in DC or Chicago), but sad, too... she's one of the few people I genuinely like, and she really made getting through the day a lot easier.  It's going to be weird not having her around next year.  I guess the good things are:  A)  Maybe she can get me a job when I lateral out of my first job;  and B)  Now we have a place in downtown Chicago to crash.  Hurrah!

       urlLink Energy Spatula  posted  urlLink her results , so I'm posting mine.  Interesting that we're both high on paranoia, narcissism and histrionic..ness.  I wonder if that's common among law students?  Maybe it's a blogging thing.  Oh, and by the way-- I fucking rule.  What, you don't believe me, do you?  WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?!   Your Results :  Paranoia:  High Schizoid:  Low Schizotypal:  Low Antisocial:  Moderate Borderline:  Low Histrionic:  High Narcissistic:  High Avoidant:  Low Dependent:  Low Obsesssive-Compulsive:  High  Larry-Guide:  Paranoid  Paranoid personality disorder is characterized by a distrust of others and a constant suspicion that people around you have sinister motives. People with this disorder tend to have excessive trust in their own knowledge and abilities and usually avoid close relationships with others. They search for hidden meanings in everything and read hostile intentions into the actions of others. They are quick to challenge the loyalties of friends and loved ones and often appear cold and distant to others. They usually shift blame to others and tend to carry long grudges.   Histrionic  People with histrionic personality disorder are constant attention seekers. They need to be the center of attention all the time, often interrupting others in order to dominate the conversation. They use grandiose language to discribe everyday events and seek constant praise. They may dress provacatively or exaggerate illnesses in order to gain attention. They also tend to exaggerate friendships and relationships, believing that everyone loves them. They are often manipulative.    Narcissistic  Narcissistic personality disorder is characterized by self-centeredness. Like histrionic disorder, people with this disorder seek attention and praise. They exaggerate their achievements, expecting others to recongize them as being superior. They tend to be choosy about picking friends, since they believe that not just anyone is worthy of being their friend. They tend to make good first impressions, yet have difficulty maintaining long-lasting relationships. They are generally uninterested in the feelings of others and may take advantage of them.   Obsessive-Compulsive  Obsessive-Compulsive personality disorder is similar to obsessive-compulsive anxiety disorder. People with this disorder are overly focused on orderliness and perfection. Their need to do everything "right" often interferes with their productivity. They tend to get caught up in the details and miss the bigger picture. They set unreasonably high standards for themselves and others, and tend to be very critical of others when they do not live up to these high standards. They avoid working in teams, believing others to be too careless or incompetent. They avoid making decisions because they fear making mistakes and are rarely generous with their time or money. They often have difficulty expressing emotion.

       urlLink Naked Drinking Coffee  has a great guest post over at  urlLink Soup's  about the  urlLink do's and dont's of guest-blogging .    Although I have not guest-blogged, I found this post highly educational, and will probably book-mark it for the future day when I am asked  to stop blogging altogether for the sake of humanity  to guest-blog.  For instance, did you know that you being told to help yourself to anything in the fridge does  not  mean helping yourself to the honey, cherries, whipped cream, frosting, and alcohol while not touching anything else?  Damn, dude, thanks for the heads-up.  I guess "make yourself at home," also probably doesn't mean, "Feel free to use my home as a porn production studio while I'm gone."  Shucks.

      In the tradition of those fine boys over at  urlLink BTQ , an update.   What I Am Doing at Work :  I finished the appellate brief last week.  Tomorrow, I am making the changes requested by our Division Chief (thankfully few to make, mostly typographic).  The final is due to my attorney by noon.  It goes to the Court of Appeals later tomorrow.  I won't be heading to lunch in celebration at noon, however.  I have another deadline tomorrow at 1...  a motion to dismiss &amp; brief in support.  I wrote a motion to dismiss for failure to comply with Rule 8 a few weeks ago, and I'll be incorporating that into this motion.  Originally, this was supposed to be a kitchen sink motion to dismiss and for summary judgment.  However, because of the time needed to deal with the appellate brief, we've decided to break this up into a motion to dimiss (due tomorrow at 1 PM) and the motion for summary judgment (due Wednesday).   What I Am Doing at Home :  Boozing, per usual.  Painting.  Getting excited that one of our roommates, Pittsburgh (who hates Florida as well as yours truly), is moving out on Tuesday, and we will be getting a new roommate in early August.  Our new roommate is handy with a stripper pole, likes to booze, and also likes to lez.  She'll fit right in here at Chez Larry and Florida.   New Favorite Spice :  Cilantro.  I am on such a cilantro kick right now.  I hated it for years and years, but lately I can't get enough of it.  I'm putting it on  everything .  I'd probably put it on my breakfast cereal if I were thinking clearly that early in the morning.   What I Am Getting Totally Psyched About :  Going back to The Republic in two weeks.  Suh-weet!  It's going to be great to go home.  I just want to be back in Texas.   New Favorite Song :  "Let's Go," Wang Chung.  Stop laughing.   What I Did This Weekend :  Friday, sucked down gin &amp; tonics with The Editor like it was my job, had drunken two hour heart-to-heart with Florida.  Saturday, looked "like a wounded animal," according to Pedro, since I was so hungover, watched  urlLink some movie with Julianne Moore  that was pretty boring, had a beer and the tastiest greasy cheeseburger  ever  with some friends for dinner, and went to a party thrown by a law school cohort.  Drank through anger and barely concealable hostility toward numerous people at party, hung out in kitchen with Pedro while another law school pal told us how he likes to jack off on his drives to Chicago (quote:  "Whatever, it's dark!  It's not like the truckers can see you jackin!").  Today:  Didn't get out of bed until 3 PM-- it's been a long time since I've done that, was generally utterly unproductive, and was generally totally cool with that.  Now, having bedtime Coke and thinking about all the junk I have to get done tomorrow at work.   What I Am Reading Right Now :    urlLink The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order  , Samuel P. Huntington.

      This past Wednesday, Florida, her boyfriend, Pedro, and I canvassed neighborhoods for an organization trying to prevent a new Amendment from being added to our state constitution.  Marriage between two people of the same sex is illegal in our state already, thanks to the In Defense of Marriage Act.  This new Amendment is deceptively simple in its wording.  It says, "That to be valid and recognized in this state, a marriage shall exist only between a man and a woman."  Most people voting in the elections will read that, go, "Well, duh," and check yes without really thinking about it.  What it does not say is that, despite that they already can't get married, this Amendment would ban civil unions between people of the same sex here.  Canvassing was interesting.  Our job wasn't to convince anybody or change anybody's mind, but just to see where people stand on the issue.  They're coded as 1 (planning to vote against the Amendment, willing to donate time and money to our organization in order to stop Amendment from passing), 2 (planning to vote against the Amendment, not willing to donate time and money), 3 (not sure), 4 (planning to vote for the Amendment, not actively organizing in support of it), 5 (planning to vote for the Amendment and actively organizing in support of it).  Basically, we're just circling numbers on a piece of paper, and selecting people to send future mailings to.  Actually, canvassing wasn't just interesting, it was great.  We split into two groups in our neighborhood-- Pedro and I, and Florida and an undergrad girl who was put in our group.  The neighborhood we were assigned was  very  middle-America blue-collar.  Most driveways had a truck in the driveway with some sub-contractor's company on it.  Plumbing, windows, roofing, etc.  Lots of pro-life stickers, a lot of American flags...  we knew we were probably in hostile territory.  Things Said to Us While Canvassing: 1.  "I tell you whut.  I got so many DUIs, I can't vote no more.  So this here?  It don't mean shit to me."  From a man who was clearly wasted at 6:30 at night.  His eyes were totally glazed over, and he was near slurring.  Which probably explains why he had the balls to tell two complete strangers (Pedro and I) that he had too many DUIs to vote (which to me, it tantamount to admitting that he probably killed someone.  You don't lose your right to vote for having DUIs.  You lose it for committing a felony.  Like, oh, vehicular manslaughter).  2.  "As a Jehovah's witness, I won't be voting for or against this Amendment.  But how do  you  feel about it?"  3.  "We're having a pool party out back, ya'll wanna join us?  ... Wait, ya'll aren't lesbians?"  to Florida and the undergrad girl.  4.  "I'm not going to lie to you, God hates faggots, and he wants them to die.  And so do I.  I hate fags."  5.  "Do you two have your permits allowing you to knock on people's doors?"  This from a woman who genuinely scared me in that creepy psychokiller way.  She got really really close to me, and started getting really pushy about permits.  I explained to her that because we were not soliciting or selling stuff, we didn't need permits.  She insisted that we did, and got about two inches from my face.  Pedro really thought she was going to try to bite my nose off.  So did I.  She still scares me.  I kind of have my doubts as to how effective this canvassing actually is.  For one, our sampling is extremely skewed.  Two, even if someone did think to himself, "Hey, this Amendment is wrong," because of us, the chance that he will actually go out and vote against the Amendment is miniscule.  I guess, however, it was a chance to expand my people skills.  For instance, I have never had a complete stranger inform me that they've gotten so many DUIs that they aren't allowed to vote anymore.  Sweet.

      I am upset right now.  The reasons why:  1.  I didn't make it onto law review.  I'm a little shocked, but this is actually the thing I am least upset about.  As a matter of fact, I'm not really upset.  Just kinda surprised.  2.  The guy I'm dating is an editor on one of the journals, and one of the four or five people who graded our case comments for the write-on.  He hasn't called today.  This is the thing that is upsetting me the most.  In fact, it really really upsets me.  We haven't been seeing each other that long, but I talked to him last night after the draft, and he must have known that I didn't get on.  That's fine--I didn't ask him about it, because I didn't want to put him in the uncomfortable position of telling me I didn't make it, if in fact that was the case.  I didn't expect him to say anything, either.  However, for him not even to call or email me today...  that hurts my feelings.  I didn't want him to call me as the person who graded my case comment;  I wanted him to call me as the person I've been seeing for six weeks.  I didn't even really want to talk about it-- I would have just told him, "Meh, complaining isn't going to change anything, so hey oh well," and then I would have changed the subject.  Really, all I wanted was just a, "Hey, I'm sorry about law review, I know you're probably disappointed...  are you okay?"  Maybe he feels really awkward about the situation, but man...  that he hasn't called really hurts my feelings.  I mean, it really stings.  3.  I can't even get drunk tonight because I have (another) busy day at work.  The appellate brief has been written and sent to the division chief for review.  However, we have a mega-kitchen sink motion due on Monday.  I got the agency's version today, and boy...  I really expected higher quality from this agency.  I'm sorry, but don't sit there and write an entire argument about how we are entitled to summary judgment because the plaintiff didn't plead each element of his cause of action.  Read up on your Rule 8 jurisprudence-- he doesn't have to (and this was not a case requiring particularized pleading).  That's such a bonehead obvious thing to me that I'm actually a little bit annoyed that I have to deal with it.  Anyway, I didn't eat lunch today or yesterday because I was so busy, and I don't think I'm going to be eating lunch tomorrow either.  Combine that with the fact that I have a presentation to attend at 9, and well-- I'm going to be working my ass off tomorrow.  Which means no getting wasted tonight and not being able to function tomorrow.  4.  I've had a monster headache since about 3.  Two gin and tonics didn't help it, either.  I have two more items to post, and then I'm going to bed.

      When the appellant's attorney writes, " Ricketts v. Ciccone , 371 F. Supp. 1249 (W.D. Mo. 1974) is instructive. . . " and the following items are all true:  1.  This is an appellate brief to the Circuit Court of Appeals. 2.  The Western District of Missouri isn't even in our circuit, let alone oh, I don't know, a circuit court. 3.  The year is 2004.

      One of the girls I work with seemed pretty obsessed last week about the writing competition, and which publication she might end up on.  On my way out of work today, I passed her desk, and just because I thought she might be interested to know, told her that Draft Night is tonight, so people should start hearing fairly soon.  Her response?  " You know that they go by rounds, right?  They tell Round 1 people, wait for them to decide if they want to join, then go on to Round 2.  Then on to Round 3.   Just so you know, in case you don't hear soon  ."  You might want to pack a lunch, Larry, you know, in case you're Round 981...  you  might not be hearing for awhile.

      I deleted some comments (3) below, just wanted to make a quick note of it.  Where I draw the line between okay and not-okay gossip may seem completely arbitrary, but I really don't feel comfortable discussing my classmates' bodies here.  I am okay with posting, "He said, she said," and maybe some particularly stupid antics, but I think commenting about people's bodies really has too much humiliation potential for the person than I'm cool with.  It's too personal.  When I'm posting here, I do take into consideration how awful I might feel if someone read what I wrote, or what someone else wrote (one reason I keep most of my gossip to myself).  Sorry I deleted the comments, but it had to be done.  Hopefully ya'll won't take offense.

      There's a convent at the basilica down the street from my house.  Friday night, Pedro, Florida, Florida's ex, and I were driving down a nearby street when we saw a few nuns.  We were joking about cat-calling them, so I yelled out, "Oh-OWWWW!!!" as a joke.  I didn't think they would hear because we were in my car with the windows rolled up.  Except Florida had her window rolled down, and they did hear.  I cat-called a pair of nuns.  I am going to hell.

      All sorts of work today.  Resumes and cover letters are due for the first phase of Fall OCI tomorrow at 9.  Additionally, I have a deadline at work tomorrow afternoon that I'm not going to make without potentially pulling an all-nighter tonight.  I'm not too thrilled about that because-- and maybe this is a big myopic of me-- nobody will know.  I don't bill hours, so yeah I'll have a work product finished tomorrow, but it's not like my attorney is going to have any idea how much time I put into it.  He won't know that it took me more than a few hours to finish it.  Oh well.  The good part to this is that I'll have an appellate brief to use as my writing sample this fall.  And that's A-OK with me.  Things are generally very stressful for me now.  We had a bunch of friends over for dinner last night, then headed out to a couple of bars, and I think I was about zero fun.  Just too many things going on right now.  Among them- 1.  Brief at work.  This is crunch week for that.  It's due on the 14th.  After that, I don't know what I'm doing at work.  I think maybe we have a mega-kitchen sink brief due to a district court in another case.  2.  Money.  I'm so poor right now, it's insane.  The good news is, I only have to make it for three more weeks, because I am going back to Texas at the beginning of August (ie. mooching off the parents).  I'll stay there until early on-campus interviewing starts back here.  3.  Speaking of OCI, getting a job for next summer.  I sent out a bunch of letters to Austin and Dallas firms last week.  Hopefully someone will bite.  I can't say that  urlLink some other people's job searches  really give me a lot of confidence.  I'm really starting to dread OCI.  Jesus that's going to suck.  4.  Boys.  A boy.  I got a huge lecture last night from Florida's ex-boyfriend about how I shouldn't settle and how I shouldn't put up with some boy's shit.  Well, I've been putting up with some shit, and I'm not happy about it.  Witness-  the guy I'm dating has been out of town for 10 days.  We talked on Tuesday.  I called and left a voice mail on Wednesday;  he didn't call back.  I called on Thursday, didn't leave a message, he didn't call back.  I didn't bother calling on Friday-- figured if he wanted to talk to me, he'd call.  He did call.  At   6:15 in the morning   on Saturday.  I said, "It's  6:15 ."  He said, "I thought you got up early to go running."        ....    ???  On a Saturday, you think I'm going to be up at six in the morning??  If you don't want to talk to me, don't call at all, let alone at six in the morning.  Seriously.  We talked later on yesterday (you know, when it wasn't   six in the morning  ), but I don't plan on calling him anytime soon.  If he wants to call me, that's fine, I'd be happy to hear from him, but I'm not into making an effort just to put up with bullshit.  5.  Publications are making their decisions this week, so I should find out soon whether or not I made it onto one of Kentucky Fried Law School's oh-so-fine publications.  I'm a little bit in full-on freak-out mode right now.  I kind of expect to be in FOFO mode until at least December.  Stay tuned.

      I almost blogged from work today after hearing this, because it was almost too good to be true.  Number One in our class (at least for fall semester, hopefully she's fallen down a few notches since) told one of the girls I work with, "  Only the people at the bottom of the class who won't be able to get jobs after graduation do public interest in the summer.  "  Incidentally, this is the same person who, when I said that the ghetto here makes the shady parts of Houston and Dallas look like Disney Land, told me, "  That's because black people don't GO to Texas, Larry  ."  Yup, she's a fucking winner.  This incident really just solidifies my hatred for this person.  May she be hit by a bus in order to preserve the quality of humankind's gene pool.

Additionally, I am trying to download the complete works of New Kids on the Block and Ace of Base.  GENIUS!  IT'S SO GENIUS!!  We've also been drinking lots.  I'm working on a 32-ozer Budlight ahora.  After drinking 3/4 of a pitcher of pina coladas made Larry-style (plain rum, orange rum, rasberry rum, vodka, triple sec, orange juice, more rum & vodka, and a few, "Oh my God, Larry, these are so strong," from Florida's).    We're going downtown in a few to go to the July 4 celebration here.  I plan on being so shitfaced I can't stand.  Hope I don't run into anybody from work.  This is all a reward.  I was so good last night.  Part of that has to do with the fact that the boy I'm dating is out of town, but details!  Last night, I spent all night writing cover letters.  Not many Dallas/Austin firms come to Kentucky Fried Law School, so I'm doing a lot of legwork by myself.  I'm going to be in Texas at the beginning of August (assuming anybody wants to interview me), so I'm sending letters now.  Hopefully I can line up some interviews.  I've gotta get back to downloading 80s music (any suggestions?  Leave a comment, por favor) and boozing.  Happy 4th, people!  Everybody Wang Chung tonight!

The rasterbator takes any picture less than 1MB, rasterizes it, and then puts it into a PDF file for you so that you can print out & make a poster.  Coolness.

      I hereby declare my total and utter crush on the Assistant Curator at the  urlLink Nasher Sculpture Center , Jed Morse.  Cute nerdmen are so hot.  The only picture I could find was  urlLink this one , in which he looks, uh, not good.  I scoured the net in search of another picture, but there is  nothing  about this guy online at all.  No bio, no pictures, no nothing.  That's okay, though.  Mmmmm, assistant curator.  Tasty.

      Well,  urlLink Fitz ,  urlLink Soup , and  urlLink E-Spatch  are all doing it, and I think we all know that I'm a sucker for peer pressure.  Thus, I present to you:   urlLink Anime  Larry!         It doesn't really look like me, I don't think.  There was no  urlLink SRI  option, so let's face it-- the likeness is questionable at best.

      Check out  urlLink I'm a PD , a blog written by a California Public Defender.  It's very honestly (and well) written, and provides some real insight into what it's like to be a young PD.

       urlLink Beanie  has a  urlLink post  with advice for 1Ls.  One of her pointers is to realize that you aren't going to be the smartest person you know at law school.  This reminded me of  urlLink Michael Dell's  speech at my graduation from UT.  One of his points was to always challenge yourself.  He said that success often comes from surrounding yourself with other people who are smarter than you.  I remember this quote:  "If you are the smartest person in the room, find a different room."    Great soundbyte.

      Back in Texas, yeehaw!  It's good to be back.  I heart Texas.  Aside from hanging with the parents, I've been interviewing.  Trying to get a job lined up for next year, not be homeless, etc.  Although Texas is where I want to end up, I'll also be looking at Chicago, DC, Kentucky Fried City, San Francisco, Birmingham, and maybe Charleston.  I need contingencies in case Texas doesn't work out.  Besides, most Texas law firms only run 6 week programs.  They really encourage split summers.  In the event I don't get two gigs in TX, maybe I can spend part of the summer in another city (SF would be  totally sweet ).  School starts... too soon.  I'm not really looking forward to going back.  I'm kind of excited about my classes (I think I'm a little  too  psyched about Federal Jurisdiction), but ...  I didn't like the way things got last spring with Spring OCI.  All the gossip, the stupid chatter about, "So-and-so is interviewing with XYZ.  He must be in the top 10%" or "Ohmygodwhoareyouinterviewingwithaaah!!! I'msostressedandfreakedoutandI'vetotallygottheshakes andImakecoffeenervous!!!"  I don't  care  who's interviewing with who.  I don't really feel like talking with people about who I'll be interviewing with.  Last semester I dealt with all of this by spending more time in the library.  I expect that this semester will see even more of that.  I can only deal with so much gossip about who is interviewing with what firms, who has more job offers, who is going to get paid more, who has callbacks, etc., before I get really fed up with it.  Aside from being bored by it, I'm generally really annoyed by people who are walking/talking stressmongers.  Quit bitching.  If you aren't going to do something to change what you're complaining/whining about (and there is  plenty  of that to go around during OCI), then shut up and deal with it.  Don't make the rest of us listen to your complaining.  In other news, Pedro and I will be indoctrinating (read:  hazing) the incoming 1Ls at our Orientation.  People hearing this usually groan, "Oh God," as if the idea of letting Pedro and I be orientation leaders could only end in disaster.  Fortunately for us, the people in charge of orientation won't realize this until it's way too late to do anything about it.  I've heard that the incoming class is even nerdier than mine, which is a little scary.  I'm kind of worried that Pedro and I will simply scare the shit out of them.  Oh well-- if you can't hack Nerd Bootcamp Larry and Pedro Style, well, you're a lost cause.  Wish the 1Ls luck.  They're gonna need it.
