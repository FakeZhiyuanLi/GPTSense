       I haven't posted for a few days. So sue me. Thursday was even more boring than I thought it would be. Oh well. My dad's started his marking well and proper now, so I'm scuppered for using the comp. Ho hum.  Had a brass day yesterday. It was okish. Erm. Not really much to say. Saw lots of people who knew other people who I know. Very confusing.  It's a small world... Yum tee tumty.  My brother came home yesterday evening, and so we're going out for a slap-up meal. In the meantime I'm supposed to be revising  cough cough . Oh well. I really do write  oh well  too much don't I? Oh well.  That's about it really for today. Can't be bothered to write much more.  Tatty bye.

       I love being lazy!  Spent most of today watching  The Magic Roundabout . Trippy or what, eh? Anyway. Got " Hat Full of Sky " today (latest kids book by the master PTerry {Terry Pratchett}). Read it in about 3 hours. Darn good book. Bloody library though. I mean, I get my notification that the book's in by text message, and I got it at ten o'clock. So I cycled down. And was the library open? Was it hell! Doesn't open 'till two on a Wednesday. So, back home, and then back out again at two. Oh well.  Tomorrow I'm going up to Whitam to stuff envelopes and stuff for my Mum. Speaking of Mum's, why does the quicktype on Nokia phones put 'nun' up before 'mum'? Stupid. Anyway, she works as the secretary for fundraising or something like that for Farleigh Hospice.  I really can't think of much else to write. If I have a brainwave, I'll let you know...

       There you are! I told you I wouldn't call it "My Fourth Blog...o-iii  I went home, destroyed the rest of the tree, mowed the lawn, dusted our evil banisters (they're made of cast iron, and are all curly and stuff. they eat people's fingers. and my shirts...), and other such stuff. I get paid for it now, yipee, cos I haven't got a job yet,  through no fault of my own I should like to add!   Projects for the summer: digging a pond and learning HTML properly. Well, I've got eight weeks of boredom so I might as well be doing something. Ho hum. We've got this sort of rockery, and two layers of grass (with the rockery in between them), and so the pond's going on the bottom, with a little waterfall going down. I dunno!  Bin told today that I'm not allowed to learn the clarinet. Oh well. Instead I get my 1/2 hour subsidised lesson with our unbeliveably cool piano teacher at school. We'll just jam for 1/2 hour ever week.  YEH   That's about it for today, adios untill next time...   p.s. thanks to my Dad doing EDEXCEL A-Level marking online, I may not be able to post every day. Not that you care.

      Eeh by gum gor blimey. Exams eh? Phew. PE and ICT today. Funfunfun!  SOOOOOO BOOOORRRRRRIIINNNNNNG.  ARGH! Oh well, 3 GCSES down (PE ICT and Drama, all the easy to spell ones), 7 to go. Sigh. And I've got all the hard ones coming up later like English and History. I hate timed essay writing.  Music tomorrow. Doesn't help that I've only had about 10 hours of lessons, but hey, c'est la vie. Or, as the French say, that's life.  On a similar note, I love the crossovers between our two languages. Like, there's the French Horn (which the French call the German Horn), and the Cor Anglais ( English Horn ). Its stuipid. Then there's French Leave (sciving), which they call English Leave (in French. durr). Likewise with the French Disease (siphilus) and a French Letter (a condom). Laungages are a load of *insert expletive here* when you come to think about it really!  Back to today then. Well, it was a pretty samey day, other than the whole exam thing. My foot decided to die when I was walking home. I get this pain in my ankle, and my whole foot goes numb. Its a bugger, I can tell you that. Just about every joint in my body clicked while I was in the exams. Fingers, knees, elbows, backs...one of my freinds (Rebecca) can click her eye! She's just weird though. Allergic to loads of stuff.  Anyhoo, I should probably go off and revise music or something like that. ooh, no, its te-ah-time-ah. Yum yum, veg and two veg (I'm a vegetarian, or more acuratly, a piscitarian {I eat fish}) mmm brackets   p.s. I promise not to call my next blog "My fourth blog... o-iii

      Wow! Well, here we are. Indeed. My first blog. Exciting stuff eh? On the offchance that anyone would ever be reading it, here's a bit about me (mostly copied from my site, but hey...)  My name is Bill and I live in Chelmsford, in Essex. I'm 16 years old and I go to Great Baddow Hiâ€¦ Sports College. I play the trumpet and piano (just passed my grade 8 trumpet yippee). I listen to jazz and classical music (sneer if you must) and play in quite a few bands/orchestras.  I am not at all normal, in that I am not your average grumpy 'Kevin' teenager, but then again neither are my friends (of which I would love to include whoever you are, unless you're horrible. Then I blow a raspberry in your face thrrrrrrp). My interests are music, electronics, physics, maths etc. and also the one of the masters of sci-fi fantasy Terry Pratchett, the others being Tom Holt and Robert Rankin. Like I said, not your average teenager.  I have a brother (20, in the merchant navy, drives cruise ships, yippee, free cruises for me), a sister (21, at Cambridge doing History, in her last year) and a mum and a dad. My mum is a secretary for Farleigh Hospice, and my dad teaches maths at my school. My mum used to teach there, which is where they met. I'm the result of a staff room romance. Sigh.  Thats enough of that... Right now (well, obviously not right now, but you know) I'm doing my GCSEs which is of course why I am now wasting time bloging away here. Oh well.  To explain the name Bilbo. OK, yes, it is the name of one of the characters from JRRTs books, but it has nothing to do with that. I am not short fat and with hairy feet (well, perhaps a little hairy) but I do have a big appetite. Anyway, at a music course I was on, someone said "Hey, Bill, Bilbo!" and it stuck. The stupid address is becase the same person thought that obliBsniggaB (BilboBaggins backwards) was excruciatingly funny. Besides, who else would have the name of their site oblibsniggab. The title of my blog, 'Absolvi meam animam' means 'I got that off my chest' in Latin. I didn't work it out myself; I've got a list as long as...erm...something very long of Latin phrases like 'I've got to see a man about a dog' and 'Beam me up, Scotty'.  Well, I should probably leave it at that for the moment, and perhaps I can go out and get a life now. Ho hum...

      So this is my blog for today. Well, I was supposed to be revising, but I ended up just watching the cricket all day. I must have been bored. Nicki was supposed to be comeing over to do my revision for me...erm...help me with my revision.  Round this time of year I get this obsessions for salads of all varieties, and being on study leave I've had even more time to make them. My mum's kinda getting angry cos the fridge is slowly filling up. I have to lean on the door to make it close. Oh well, all the more food for me!  Exams tomorrow. PE and ICT. Well, who gives a flying monkey's about PE (well, actually I do a bit), I mean its only PE. But, being a SPORTS COLLEGE its a bloody compulsery GCSE. Stuipid school. As for ICT>well, seing as our first teacher did naff all with us in the first year, our new teach spent all the time resuscitating our coursework, and so as a result we have no theory. I'll just have to play it by ear. Its ony 20% of the GCSE after all.  I just missed out on a job actually. There's a computer shop in my town called 'The Computer Shop' (wow) and they aren't getting any computers sold, so they asked me (after I dropped a CV in) to play my trumpet outside, and they'd have a whipround at the end of the day, and I could put my case on the ground and catch a few pennies. Sounds great doesn't it. But then of course Chelmsford bloody Town bloody Council have to go and bloody say "You need a license". Bastards. Oh well. Back to the drawing board. I'm making money now by massacring a dead tree in our garden for my parents. Its quite fun actually, if a little boring (if that makes sense).  If you haven't already worked out what the o-iii  I'm sorry if this seems a bit like an essay (that's what Ricki says at least), but I've got a lot to talk about.  Oh yeah, be warned, I will probably get into a nasty habbit of URL spamming. Click a few, they're usually good.  Thats all I can think to write about for the mo, more to come later (unless I forget)

       MY ARM HURTS!!!  Spent about two hours outside Tesco's rattling (or not rattling as the law says) tins for Farleigh Hospice. What can I say? MY ARM HURTS. AAAAAARRRRRGGGGGGGGHHHHH. To add to my pain and suffering, on the 25th of June I'm having half a toenail chopped off. But I might get crutches, which is cool. Yay. The almost unbearable pain could be a problem, but it's worth it for the crutches. I think. Oh well (and there I go and do it again).  I'd love to waffle on for lines and lines and pages and pages, but I'm just too bloody nackered.

       Eeh by gum  Helping my friends with their science revision. God I am  tired . Working my site. I got rid of my old mail15 server site, cos you need to spam F5 to make the pictures show. Now I have a site at  urlLink 0catch , but the address is a bit naff so I'm going to buy a new one. It's still under construction btw.  Not much to say once again. My life's a bit boring really, what with all GCSEs and stuff. Sigh. All revision and likewise. Oh well. In three weeks time I have eight weeks drudgery. Everyones says "WOW! EIGHT WEEKS" and then it slowly starts to hit them that it's going to be the eight most boring weeks of their lives.  I promise once my GCSEs are over and intersting things start happening I will start bloging again.   Promise!
