       I believe this is one of the many bands i got from Annie. I like them alot they havve some really good songs like My Evil Plan to Save The World and, All That is Good. They also have some more unusual ones like These Are Not My Pants in which they sing a chorus in several many different ways like country, heavy metal, and all that.

      There's really so much I could say about smiles I love them more than anything when someone smiles they look their best. A smile can be for many different reasons. Whatever those reasons are I encourage you to keep smiling a smile can brighten anyone's day when they walk by you on a rainy day and see your smile they cant help but smile themselves. You see how one smile can make a whole world of difference. So smile a little huh.  Id also like to take the time to give props to Sarah K because she smiled when she sung at a choir concert and it made all the difference it was so nice to see someone smile she was the only won who did the whole time until it ended :) Anyway just thought id put that in there because it's something worth mentioning.

      Well this is the game I often seem to find myself playing in study hall and other various times unless ting is around in which case she insists on playing Egyptian Rat Screw which I am miserable at but in some strange way is still fun to play. Anyway that's not why I made this entry. I am going to list the rules for all of you who don't know how to play because it is a great game. The rules are as follows: The game can be played with as many people as you would like.  The game is played with two as the lowest card and ace as the highest. There are seven rounds the first round you deal seven cards every round after that it goes down one card each round. The first round begins by anyone cutting the deck to determine which suit is the trump suit.  Then the dealer deals out seven cards. In this game the goal is to get tricks if you do not get a trick in any given round you lose and are out for the remainder of the game.  To get a trick you must have played the highest card that stuck to the suit that the person to the left of the dealer started the round with because that is how the round begins by the person to the left of the dealer putting out any card of his or her choice. You must stick to suit which for all you non card players means you must play the same suit that the person put down. If you do not have any of the suit that is in play you must play another to do so you automatically lose the trick unless it is the trump suit in which case you win if yours is the highest trump however you may only play trump or another suit than the one that was started if you have none of that suit. When everyone has put in a card the winner of that trick then starts the next one and that is continued until all the cards have been played.  At the end of each round you total up who has the most tricks and that person next round gets to choose trump **after looking at his or her hand. The game goes on like that until all players have lost by not getting any tricks in rounds note it does not have to be at the same time this is entirely an individual game.   Exceptions: (what good card game doesn't have them) On round four if you have one of each suit you automatically win the whole game if two or more of you do then you just continue playing the normal game. If you are on rounds five or above and someone calls out that they don't have any face cards then you must re deal if the player shows them as proof.  **note this is obviously an optional rule and it includes aces as face cards

      yeah i am its a good thing i suppose cause im quiet a music fan. I now have around 5900 songs. Which if you think about it would have been alot of money since its 99 cents per song and all. But its really nice its simple and easy and best of all it supports the authors now i used top download songs all the time before all the leagal problems. Its really worth it when you think about it when you think about it cause really how much is 99 cents not much in the scheme of things and it helps out all your favorite bands all you are really doing by downloading is hurting your favorite bands.

      The World Is Yours His name is Tonny Montanna the world will remember him by another name Scarface If they wouldnt have done.. what i told them not to do then they would still be alive I'm gunna make him an offer he cant refuse Fish, chips, cup o' tea, bad food, worse weather, Mary-fucking-Poppins London! Protection from what? "Zee Germans"? Why don't you make like a tree, and get the fuck outta here? I killed your cat! I thought that it would bring closure to our relationship! Now although this was an embarrasing situation for Tom to be in, Chris had to respect the fact Tom was holding what appeared to be two loaded shotguns What's wrong with that? People never rob restaurants, why not? Bars, liquor stores, gas stations, you get your head blown off stickin' up one of them. Restaurants, on the other hand, you catch with their pants down. They're not expecting to get robbed, or not as expecting.  Oh, I'm sorry. Did I break your concentration?  Bless me father, for I have just killed quite a few men.  Who took the jam outta your doughnut? Turkish: You took the fucking jam outta my doughnut, Tommy, you!  Amazing people truly Some of my favorite movies and characters

      "Yellow wakes me up in the morning. yellow gets me on the bike every day. Yellow has taught me the true meaning of sacrifice. Yellow makes me suffer YELLOW IS THE REASON I'M HERE." -Lance Armstrong is a seven-year cancer survivor  why am i talking about this you ask well i think its a good cause  whenever a chance this easy is presented you should always help out even when its tough you still need to consider the people who need your help and give it to them. If its not through this i dont care but in someway you need to give back think of all you have recieved and consider all the other people out there in the world who need help. Do the right thing.

      Im getting a new raquet because the old one i had was so weird that it was hurting my game. So now im getting a Tour NXGraphite MP which is a prince and my first one of that kind i played with elliot's alot and thats how i found out about it i like it alot. This time i will be getting a mid plus instead of and oversize because i really have to much power already for an oversize. So yep thats pretty fun tennnis camp was great i enjoyed it alot i think though that there is a bit to much life and not enough tennis so me and elliot are thinking about going to nike tennis camp at the U next year which ronnie says is reallly great so it sounds like a good place to try.

      1. I can't reach my license unless you hold my beer.  2. Sorry, Officer, I didn't realize my radar detector wasn't plugged in.   3.Aren't you the guy from the Village People?  4. Hey, you must've been doin' about 125 mph to keep up with me. Good job!   5. Are You Andy or Barney?   6. I thought you had to be in relatively good physical condition to be a police officer.   7. You're not gonna check the trunk, are you?   8. I pay your salary!   9. Gee, Officer! That's terrific. The last officer only gave me a warning, too!   10. Do you know why you pulled me over? Okay, just so one of us does.   11. I was trying to keep up with traffic. Yes, I know there are no other cars around. That's how far ahead of me they are.   12. When the Officer says "Gee Son....Your eyes look red, have you been drinking?" You probably shouldn't respond with,"Gee Officer your eyes look glazed, have you been eating doughnuts?  Thanks to steph who contributed a few later you all have fun

      Love is somthing everyone needs something everyone wants something everyone could have something that they have but to find by thyself (crudy but hey it took all of five seconds) catch me a break eh'  But to be frank, and give it thee again. And yet I wish but for the thing I have: My bounty is as boundless as the sea, My love as deep; the more I give to thee, The more I have, for both are infinite. not by thyself  Loving you was easy, losing you was hard. Loving you is still easy, but knowing you are no longer mine, is the hardest of it all. also not by thyself  yuck all this love stuff is making me sick get it off get it off

Then i went to dano's grandparents (note i did not see dano all day) sorta funny anyway so i stayed around and hungout wiith mostly the same people kel told me all about her trip alone with a guy hockey team it was quote "some version of what her heaven would be like" the whole time i was thinking boy she reminds me of someone else we all know anyway so i did that and then went out on white bear to watch the fireworks which were fabulous this year it was a great 4th i hope yours was as fun as mine

Amen   Postremo pensandum Quanta doctrinae commoditas sit in libris Quam facilis, quam arcana! Quam tuto libris humanae ignorantia paupertatem sine verecundia denudamus! Hi sunt magistri qui nos instruunt sine virgis et ferula, sine verbis et cholera, sine pannis et pecunia. si accedis, non dormiunt; Si inquirens interrogas, non abscondunt; Non remurmurant si oberres; Cachinnos nesciunt, si ignores.  (Richard de BuryPhilobiblon, I, 9)   And finally, one must consider how great the ease of learning  there is in books, how yielding, how trusty !  How safely we reveal, without shyness, in the face of our books the poverty of our human ignorance ! They are teachers who instruct us without switches or rods, without slaps or anger, without notice of rags or riches. If you approach them , they are not asleep; If you ask a question, they do not hide; They do not mutter at you if you make a mistake;  When you are ignorant, they do not know how to laugh at you.
