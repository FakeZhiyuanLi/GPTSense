						   Well, after a couple of weeks of Nutrisystem - something I really thought was going to work for me - not one pound has come off!  Not one!  I thought by now I'd have at least lost something!  So I finally told Michael and he wasn't too happy either.  He was disappointed just like I was.  I told him about eDiets and what they do and said it might be a better way.  He agreed and supported the decision to try something else.  I've got to cancel the auto-delivery of the Nutrisystem stuff from QVC though.  Guess I'll do that today.  Well, that was done - LOL.  So I figure once I'm done with the remaining Nourish products, I'll sign up for eDiets and try Atkins again.  Maybe with someone making my menus for me, it will be easier because I won't have to figure all that out on my own.  Basically all I'll have to do is take the menu they give me and hit the grocery store.  It will be easier that way because I won't have to figure out what I'm going to eat from day to day - it will be done for me.  I don't know if I want to try Atkins again or go for something else called the Zone Diet.  I think it's similar to Atkins but not as stringent on the fruits and veggies.  But according to the DNA at eDiets, Atkins is the one they recommend the most to get started.  So I'll probably follow their advice and go with that.  They also say you can change plans at any time, so if I get tired of Atkins or want to try something else, I can change without any extra cost.  Something  has  to work though.  It just   has   to!

						   I just don't know... I've tried this damned diet for a while now and I've not lost one fucking pound!  I just think I'm doomed to be fat forever and be miserable on top of it.  I'm trapped in a body I hate, living a life I despise and withdrawing from the world around me more and more everyday.  I've gotten to the point that it just doesn't seem worth the effort to try anymore.  It's as if there is some force that is keeping me from doing the things I want to do.  A force determined to keep me miserable and lonely and depressed and every other negative adjective you can think of.  I'm so ashamed of myself - I hate getting out in public.  The other day I saw a woman who was heavier than me and I nearly did a double take because I was surprised to see someone fatter than I am.  I'm so tired of beling like this.  I'm so tired of trying things to end this misery and nothing works.  I'm so tired of getting my hopes up that "this is the one" or buying things that are supposed to work and they don't.  I've got exercise tapes that have never been out of the package.  I've got a system of Tony Robbins - one of the world's best life coaches - and I've never even listened to it.  Sometimes I honestly think it will be best if I do die by the time I'm 40 - what's the point?  I can't live my life the way I am and nothing I do seems to make things any better or get me any closer to a lace in my life that would allow me to accomplish what I want.  It would just be good to be out of my misery for a change - even if that does mean being six feet under.

						   Well, I'm not real sure how this thing is going to work out for me.  I think I'm mainly going to use it to replace the "diary" at the  urlLink Nutrisystem  site, but I may use both too.  I'm doing okay I guess, although I seem to be a bit tearful over the past few days.  I'm sure a lot of it has to do with our little visit to Three Rivers on Sunday and getting exposed to Donna & her hubby.  Yes she hit home with some comments she made directed at me about my experience with religion, but I shut down and refused to be sucked back into that.  What's the old phrase,  "Fool me once, shame on you... fool me twice, shame on me."   I've just had so many terrible experiences with religion and church and so-called people of g*d that I don't know who to trust or what to believe.  Plus it seems easier and so much safer to just stay in my own little world of anger, bitterness and rage - at least here I'm in familiar territory  AND  don't have to worry about getting hurt  again .    We finally got our new couch delivered Saturday - I still really like it.  It was bigger than I remembered, but it is SO much better than what we originally had.  We donated the other furniture to Carol - I'm sure she will get good use of them.  I still need to tackle our spare bedroom though and rearrange everything in there.  I'm considering putting the bed at an angle in the far corner - but I still have to go through all the clutter that is on the bed and figure out what to do with all of it.  Maybe some will be tossed, but for the most part, I believe I will have to find a "home" for the stuff.  Right now it just looks awful and junky.  Hate looking in there.  Had to call our doctors and set up payment plans for all the bills from my stay in the hospital in January.  Medicaid turned us down - we made too much money.  Actually the cutoff was $415 for the two of us - whether that was per week or per month I don't know.  But I basically knew that it wouldn't get approved.  Anytime we've tried to get assistance we've been turned down for one reason or another.  Hell, I even got denied membership into a yahoo group for pete's sake!  Who knows why?  It was some stupid FB group and they rejected my membership.  I emailed the owner back to find out why - haven't heard anything yet, but I'm curious as to the reason.
