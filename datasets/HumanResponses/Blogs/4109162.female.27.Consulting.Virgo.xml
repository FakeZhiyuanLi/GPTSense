      After a miserable day of office politics and the frustrations of dealing with a sickeningly incompetent team leader, something I am still learning to accept as normal... I escape.  DS' mom is in town from barcelona and I'm excited to catch up with her after so many years!  A refreshing reminder to keep things light and not get so stressed comes from running into the cute guy from salsa class for the second time this week.  Hehehe.

      i must admit that i felt terribly exposed to the city without my iPod ear buds plugged in this morning. i guess after a year of being back in the US, i am officially a new yorker again. the ny times had a great article about iPods and their significant place in NYC culture - generally how new yorkers isolate themselves with those little white earplugs and publicly identify with the greater iPod community.  i am tired.  met .r. for dinner last night at the tried and true, coffee shop. that place has never failed us in moments of desperation to speak of our s&f adventures. i had an epiphany on the way about post-casual sex hangups and decided they have no place in the life of a late twenty-something s&f new york woman. there are still too many double standards trying to break us down. easier to say after a comforting IM chat with .j. earlier in the afternoon. i am who i am and i thank .j. for reminding me of it.  hectic day ahead. in nauseous response to a third peers serious ass-kissing at work, a respected peer states, "i am not going to compete with my team members to prove anything. i will rely on the quality of my work." thank you, .m.  good day.

      not like me to be the first one in the office.  i came in an attempt to avoid a late night and here i'm blogging instead of working.  grooved to the beat of the orishas on the way in.  "triple threat" as the headline of the ny metro free newspaper and i have to think twice that the subway is near empty.  yesterday i celebrated (?) my year-in-country for having survived my first year back in the united states after almost five years in latin america.  started this morning's internet visit with a quick read of a fellow pcv's blog, remembering and yearning for those simple days.  transition's a bitch.  the weekend's festivities did remind me of how wonderful it is to be single and fabulous in nyc.  a killer bike ride, many mojitos, sonora poncena concert in central park, salsa dancing, unexpected encounters, and general scandal.  happy monday ;-)
