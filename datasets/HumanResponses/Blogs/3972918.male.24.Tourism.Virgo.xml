       The thing about living in the desert is that there really isn't very much to get excited about or to look forward too. There really isn't anything here at all, except for sand and old people who like to golf alot. I keep asking myself why im here, why I came to live here. There must be a reason, a purpose to all of this, because, although i like the hotel and the people I work with, there are lots of aspects of my life that are shitty and extremly hard to deal with. I'm pondering with the idea of just leaving, but i think there may be an underlying purpose to me being here. There must be, otherwise i'm just punishing myself for no reason, because as much as i hate it, there are things keeping me here, i just don't know what or why.

          It amazes me that its actually legal for hotels to take multiple reservations for the same room. The hotel where I work do   it all the time, in fact at certain times of the year, its almost a daily occurrence. This week we have a really big group in house, and they've managed to sell us over by almost 40 rooms. That means that 40 people who have 'guaranteed' reservations will be relocated to another hotel. To me this seems just a tiny little bit hypocritical, even though they have a reservation, they may not get a room, but if they don't show up we charge the first nights room and tax. In other words, its ok for us not to have a room which is reserved but its not ok, if someone has a reservation and doesn't arrive.       The theory behind overselling is simple, that people frequently make reservations and then don't show up, which is true, and the only way to truly sell out is to over-book. But is it really morale? And what about the people who have been planning trips for a long time, like the people who research which resort they want to stay in and get really excited? When they arrive we tell them we have no room, of course they get pissed off, they have a right to be. But we do compensate them quite generously, and if we know we're over sold we ask people to volunteer throughout the day, which makes it easier.  The thing that gets me though is that we can't just be honest about why we have no room or why we put ourselves in that position. This is a common practice throughout most of the tourism industry - airlines and restaurants do it all the time, but at least they are honest. At most hotels the standard line is that several guests decided to extend their stay unexpectadly and that if we have a method of payment on-file it's illegal for us to evict them. Which is the truth if that were actually the truth. The truth is that a big fat money hungry corporations decided that it wasn't enough for them to charge just once for a room, that they would like charge as many times as possible, those who do show up and those who don't, why can't i just tell people that?

       I got back to the desert a couple of days ago and I have to admit its isn't as bad as I thought it would be. It's definitely hotter than hell during the day, but im not out in it that much so it doesn't really bother me. Adjusting back into the desert lifestyle has been quite difficult, getting used to people again and having to be nice to people all day in work is a bit draining, but hey, it could be much worse.  The guests we have in the hotel are horrid, really cheap and really nasty. They've actually started making stuff up to get as big a discount as they can. The people on the cheapest rates are the worst, especially travel agents and associates, they know the industry and they know exactly how to get what they want. It sucks ass. How can people actually believe that its ok to be nasty to people to save a bit of money? Don't they realize how much of an impact they have on people's lives. How do you think a travel agent would react if you went into their office and started yelling at them? Its so ridiculous, because we gave them a room that looks over the golf course instead of the pool, we've not only ruined their holiday, but we've also managed to destroy their marriage, disturb their kids and wreck their whole lives. Im starting to find it so hard to take these people seriously, I actually laughed in one womans face today when she asked how I was going to compensate her because she was embarrassed when the server in the restaurant told her she couldn't charge to her room because her credit card declined.

       Have you ever been in an elevator thats really crowded, like totally over-loaded?  Your standing there and everone is squeezing and up against you, pushing past people to get out and finally there's some space, and you can almost breath again, but the fucker pining you against the wall refuses to move forward?  So another 25 floors, your standing there, an old granny with a blue rinse 2 inches from your face, who has about 3 feet of space in front of her but won't move forward.  Thats because she is an elevator person, and thats just what they do.

       Went to Protection island today with my parents. It was nice to spend some time with them, although I did get properly drentched when the rain moved over the mountain from Vancouver. The boat ride over was interesting, the captain had simply stuck some cushions onto a couple of planks of wood in his converted fishing trawler, called it a ferry and charged us five quid each for the 10 minute journey. The island itself is lovely, the views were amazing, although some of the 'houses' looked more like my garden shed in Northern Ireland. I think ill leave islands like that for people like my parents, after today, the closest I ever want to get to nature again is looking at it from my balcony.

         Its strange how the human mind works, how things from the past will pop up every now and then and take you totally by surprise, how all of a sudden a door is open and old memories and issues come flooding back. Maybe its just this time of year, or because the lack of a television set in my brothers place in Niniamo is making me thinking about things a lot more. I think I might need closure, although him not speaking to me for weeks and walking past me in clubs without even making eye contact should have been enough. I think in a sick way he blames me for the things that happened, even though it was him that was waiting for me. But I think that's what it is, I think I need closure, I need to stop thinking about him, to stop dreaming.

        Why is it that large organization think that they can exploit people, whenever they want and how ever they want? Today I was at 7/11 buying a pack of cigarettes, I didn't have a light so I asked for matches, that was when the 15 year old behind the counter told me that they didn't supply matches because they were trying to increase their lighter sale, that infact lighter sales have increased by 300% since they stopped. I think this is disgusting, not only do I have to pay $9(can) for a pack of fags, but I have to then spend $1.99 an over-priced lighter. This means that in order for me to smoke a cig, it costs my over $10, how ridiculous is that? And 7/11 isn't the only place, this seems to be a bigger trend, rippling throughout the country, and I for one am sick of being exploited. cigarettes cost enough without having to be forced to buy an over-priced lighter, what's the world coming too? Are my cigarettes not taxed enough? what's next, are businesses going to start charging people to use the ash-trays outside their buildings? Where does it stop? I ask all who view this page to visit their site and ask if this is something they intend to do throughout all of their stores and tell them how pissed off we are that we can't get a freakin' pack of matches, simply because they want to increase sales margins:

      Kids are assholes, the really cute, innocent looking ones are always the worst as well. I only truely discoverd this when i drunkenly agreed to babysit my mates 9 year old. I don't know what i was thinking, it seemed like a good idea at the time, although as you'll discover drunken foolishness always does with me.  The day started off quite well, what with him being tired and sleepy. He just sat and played with his neopets ( urlLink www.neopets.com ), which is actually quite cool. It all went a bit Pete tong as soon as the little shit stole my triple shot, Starbucks espresso and knocked it back while i was at the loo. Looking back, that’s when I made my first big mistake - not slitting my wrists. You can imagine, blond innocent looking Uriah, overwhelmed by a caffeine rush, starting his 5 hour rampage, his only objective: to thoroughly pissing me off.  So there i was, really hung over, sitting with this little shit running rings around me screaming and laughing. First there was the fort made out of kitchen chairs, couch cushions and his comforter. At first i throughout was harmless, until, of course the little fucker start launching his toy cars at me from behind it. To him this was the most amusing game in the world, and quickly progressed from cars to other objects, like his mothers shoes and various things from his room, the most painful of which being his clock radio (I’m still bruised). The thing that annoys me the most was that the forts construction was quite clever, sitting wall to wall in the hallway, almost three feet wide it was almost impossible for me to get over it, and when i finally did, he attacked me with a fucking huge plastic baseball bat.  It was after i had the little prick under control (with the aid of a long piece of rope and the threat of child services) that I made the second big mistake of the day. After sometime, he convinced me that he would behave himself and was able to come to the shop with me to pick up a few things. Needless to say, as soon as the car stopped, the little bitch jumped out and made a bee-line for the new Super-WalMart, which is the size of most small cities. After 30 minutes searching for him, there i was dragging him out kicking and screaming, much to the disgust of some old granny with a blue rinse. She was quick to point out how crap i was doing, and how misbehaved he was; i quickly reminded her that it was rude to interfere with other peoples business and asked her ever so politely to fuck off.  When I finally got him back to the apartment, I quickly realized that when kids come down they're grumpy as fuck, and after several tantrums because I wouldn’t let him play his X-Box, I finally locked him in his room, which is where I found him forty minutes later asleep on top of a huge pile of crap he had pulled out of his closet.   In my opinion, kids are assholes because they can be.  They don't need any other reason.

      With everything thats been going on recently i've found myself thinking about what it would be like to be in prison or in a detention centre.  I think, what with my sexual orientation, i might actually enjoy a couple of weeks with big strapping lads in orange jump suits.  Although i don't know if i could cope with the bread and water or the whole being locked up thing for too long.

       Life in the desert is moving on as normal. Faith and Michael have bought themselves a car, a nice toyota about 1990 i think, white with pop-up lights. Its all very exciting. Im going to buy Alfredo's Laptop for a ridiculously low price. Its in very good condition and is pretty much all the technology i need for the time being, Only $400 for a P4 with tons of Ram, so im excited to be online again.  Faith and Michael are talking about getting a place together, just a one bedroom, so that they can save some money. I think they're only going to save like $100 a month or so, which isn't that much really. I'll probably end up moving in with Phil and Dev, or rather they can move in with me, my appartment is much nicer and considerably cleaner. I guess we'll see how it all pans out, the extra money would be nice.  Im bored in work, today is a very quiet day. ive mostly surfed the net and chatted with people. My job is starting to get really boring, the same old stuff day in day out. Maybe it is time to move on.

       1. The place of eternal punishment for the wicked after death, presided over by Satan. 2. a. A situation or place of evil, misery, discord, or destruction. b. Torment; anguish. 3.a. The powers of darkness and evil. 4. Palm Desert California, 92260.  For everyone hell is different, whether we're discussing 'Hell" in this physical life or the next (who knows, eh?). For me, right now hell is Palm Desert, CA 92260. I've been thinking a lot about the choices I've made in the past which have lead me to this place at this time. Why here, why now, why ever? So much has been happening over the past coulpe of weeks, im very confused about what is going on, who i've turned into, who I actually want to be. Im finding it really hard to adjust to everything thats been going on, what with Enrica and stuff. Ajusting to work and the appartment without her being arround is quite difficult. Everything is really strange, im trying to decide what im going to do whether to move on or to hang arround and see what happens. As much as life here is going from bad to worse, i think there is something keeping me here, or perhaps im just kidding myself. I have no idea what to do. Its far to much to think about.

        Before I started to work for the resort, i actually thought that i cared about people, and about what they thought, infact i used to actually care, but i think im loosing that. Im so cynical about everything now, no matter what has happened to a guest the first thing that crosses my mind is how much money im going to have to give them so they go away and leave me alone. This isn't how this industry should be, why should i have to rely on money and giving away free stuff to make people happy. That fact of the matter is that i/we shouldn't. But is this the industry that we have created? These days it isn't enough for us to solve the problems and offer to buy them, dinner or whatever we do. It's one of the first questions out of our guests mouths these days - How are you going to compensate me? Before i used to actually feel bad when crappy things happened to guets, no im just like 'whatever', because instead of it being about guests enjoying the resort, its about how much they can milk you for. Somedays i feel like a dairycow. I love working with guests and i love helping guests solve problems, but if they turn it arround and demand money and to be over-compensated im like, Cry Me A River, you complaining, moaning biotches.

       I found this site while surfing and pondering what to do with my crappy desert existance, this guy is really obnoxious and totally opinionated. Not only is much of it quite offensive but, its also pretty funny. You should check it out, take it all with a pinch of salt though, his articles about Bush and Kids Art had me laughing for ages.
