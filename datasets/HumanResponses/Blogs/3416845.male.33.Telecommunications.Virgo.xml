      Start tonight.  I'm exhausted and want to think of something else besides work for a while.  I suppose just writing here is the best way to actually get the hang of the whole deal.  I'm listening to The Smithereens.  Strange, I never realized how much each of their songs sounds like the last one I listened to.  Is that called "creating your own sound" or is it just lazy composition.  I know when I start writing a mess of emails I tend to start using the same phrase over and over...even my poems start looking like inbred mongrels after a couple hours.  And hey, I'm not snarkin' The Smithereens....it's just that they sounded so different during my college years.  Then again, I suppose a lot was different then.  I gotta admit, I wish I didn't know some stuff.  I mean there's lots of things I didn't know.  And it's not because it's gross or something petty like that (I actually like "gross")-- it's just that sometimes the more you know the more points from which one's thoughts can diverge.  I think I need an example.  Keh, common logic says that the more clues you get, the better chance you have of solving a crime, right?  That seems to make sense.  But let's say that you're stepping into something like OJ's crime scene.  And let's say that there's even more stuff there.  Not just a glove and a hat....but there are a couple ties, some cufflinks, a half-eaten donut, a toadstool, and a tube of toothpaste.  I picture the cop scratching his head and saying...."man, there's a lot to work with here".  So there's lots of clues....they have to make sense, right?  I mean, someone was murdered.  How do these clues lead to a murder?  Here's the deal.  The amount of clues really doesn't matter, does it?  It's the question that matters:  How did this murder happen and who did it?  Sweet.  I have a question and I use my brain to figure it out based on all of these clues.  Super-cool.  But life isn't like that.  Wanna know why?  Me too.  The big difference between life and solving a crime is that we don't know the question.  Those who figure out the question are the ones that can take these zillion clues that we're given and figure it out.  I'm not one of those people.  That sucks.  I don't know the right question to ask.  I've just got a million clues and a mess of faulty synapses trying to fire and make them connect in a logical way.  So what, right?    So this: The question is more important than the answer.  It focuses us and allows us to filter out the irrelevant crap.  Soon enough we spiral into the Truth and we eat a sandwich, brush our teeth, and contentedly (yup...that's nearly a real word) go to bed.    And throw another wrinkle in....I'm trying to follow logic and reason (albeit somewhat skewed) in this whole deal.  But is logic and reason the only means to that "Truth"?  Could astrology hold the key?  How about Phrenology?  How about just a really good shrink?  Perhaps a solid faith in God is really all it takes.....I think many people would agree with the last lil' bit.  And throw in another wrinkle....would we know the "Truth" if we found it?  I mean, if it knocked on our cerebrum's door would we welcome it in?  I mean, if it were me....I'd take a good long look at Mr Truth through my peephole and if it were really icky I'd ask him to go check out someone else.  You know, the whole I'm-Busy-Right-Now-Watching-The-Discovery-Channel excuse?  Ahhhhhh.....  Well, this definitely wasn't about work.  I suppose if I have a point it's this.  I wish I didn't have so many dots to connect (not that I'm all that smart..I think the way I'm writing belies my lack of intelligence).  I just wish I could forget stuff.  Something tells me that I'd be able to figure things out better.    I suppose this is good enough for a first post.  The next will undoubtedly be much shorter.....and perhaps more lucid.  with a smile, ~Jim
