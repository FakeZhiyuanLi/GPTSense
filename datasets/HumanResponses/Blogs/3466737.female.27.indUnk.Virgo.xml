      So, Sasquatch was a good time indeed. We arrived in sunny George, Washington just in time to watch the Long Winters play their 45 minute set. They're a band that I can listen to, but was never really into. Until yesterday, anyway. Their live show is awesome. They have a good deal of charisma and are entertaining not only when they're playing their songs, but in between. Yay!  That guy below? That's John Roderick... he's the lead singer for the Long Winters.     The rest of the festival was fun, too. After the Long Winters, we headed down to the main stage to prepare for Built to Spill and the Shins. Both of their sets were way too short. 45 minutes is not nearly long enough... I'm just getting warmed up by then! Some naked friend of the Shins made a guest appearance on stage during their set... somehow none of the security goons noticed.  Once those guys were done, we headed up for overpriced food and sat down for a while and listened to the Postal Service, who I don't really dig, but my husband does. Some crew member asked me for my ticket stub because he collects them, so I gave it up without protest.   We found a decent seat and patiently waited for the Roots to start playing... once they began, we decided it wasn't our thing and headed westward toward Seattle.  About halfway home, I remembered that we were going to use our ticket stubs to get into the special Shins Post-Sasquatch party at Neumo's and that I am a complete moron for giving it up so easily. Needless to say, we're at home tonight, geeking the evening away, instead of watching the Shins. Better luck next time...

      Every week I work fewer and fewer hours, and every week I am even more ready for the weekend than I was the previous week. Despite how nervous I am about being laid off, I am so ready to be out of my current employment situation. Don't get me wrong, it's the best job I've ever had, and I really enjoy it, but it's like when you're a Senior in high school and you're nearing the end... you know you should give 100% but you just can't because you're burned out and ready to be free.  Well, except that I'm still giving 100%, I'm just not here 100% of the time. Average it out and it'd probably be about 90%. I'm still doing better than the rest of my group. At least I've got that going for me...

      I don't know why, but I'm dying for a gmail account. I could wait for the non-beta release of it, but I need it now! Why? I have access to webmail via my personal domain, and large amounts of storage. Everyone else is doing, so must I!  The new Blogger is cool... better than the old Blogger, as far as automation and layouts go. I wasn't happy with TypePad (I'll admit to not giving it a fair enough chance), and LiveJournal... not so much. I could host it myself, but I just don't feel like putting the effort into designing a template. Maybe if I get into this again like I was before. I do hope to stick with this habit this time. I blogged for two years regularly (too regularly, sometimes), but I miss it. My writing skills are lacking, and I found this a good way to keep in practice. Hopefully photos will be posted on a daily basis. I enjoy viewing weblogs with the photos intermingled amongst the text, even when they don't coincide.  We'll see.

      the only downfall i can see to gmail (so far, anyway) is that it goes down, often. and getting back in can be difficult. stupid server errors!!! i'm impatient, so i'm not going to 'try again in 30 seconds'... it's going to be more like three seconds (and every three seconds thereafter...)  oh well, it's beta and it's free and it's still better than other free email out there...   anyone in need of an account?

      god bless the freaks. they were out in full force today at the fremont solstice parade, held in the center of the universe (fremont, of course!).     we got there plenty early to meet up with a friend and found some decent real estate for parade watching. everyone's favorite naked bicyclists were there, in droves! so many more than i expected, though i've never been. the parade was very colorful and had me laughing and smiling almost non-stop.      my favorite site there was the group of OVERDRESSED bicyclists, complete with cocktails! they just couldn't fathom the idea of naked or underdressed cyclists. accessorize, accessorize, accessorize!!  i made it almost all the way through the parade when i finally decided to find some shade. it was 1pm and i'd already netted a great sunburn on my left arm and face. my husband and friend found me once all was said and done and we met his girlfriend and scored a table at dad watsons.      the festival portion was pretty standard, same vendors and causes as usual. we missed the art cars, but i totally forgot about them anyway. we drank some strawberry cooler, kim and caroline enjoyed a gyro and a raspberry shortcake, then we headed towards our respective buses for our journey home.     after a two hour nap from 6:30 to 8:30 and a very late dinner, we are wide awake messing with our photos.   good times!!!

      so much good going on right now... how can a girl complain?  *had a rockin' good interview at the new kitchen shop around the corner from our apartment. it's a part-time gig which would be more recreational than traditional work. where else can i meet awesome chefs from the city's best restaurants, while on someone's payroll?  *saw three people from my old employer that I haven't seen in 14 months. good, good and double good.  *it's 85 degrees outside (according to seattletimes.com), but very cool in my apartment. the best of both worlds -- looking out my window and seeing brilliant blue and fluffy white while not sweating!  *tomorrow is the fremont fair and the first time i will witness the parade. a favorite friend is probably joining us, so super good times for sure!  *my husband's the best in the world... truly top notch!  *san francisco trip in 16 days (and counting!!!)  and how could I forget...  *no work today! last week i declared today a sick day.  so there, all good, no bad, no complaints whatsoever. happy weekend!

        I started the week out by breaking my most favorite vase, the one with high sentimental value attached to it.     And I ended the week by breaking one of my Fiesta plates -- something I never thought possible. First one broken in the 7 years I've owned them. Easily replaceable though.  What's next?

      There's this sound that the vertical blinds make when the wind is blowing through them, and it instantly turns my mood sour. Imagine the sound of a bicycle with a playing card stuck in the spokes to make it sound rough. That's kind of what it sounds like, except the blinds are metal so it's a slightly more... metallic sound. It's as annoying as a female cat in heat that just won't stop her chirping. It sends chills up my spine and sometimes just pisses me off. It's unexplainable, and completely irrational but I can hear it, no matter what room it's coming from.  Now is the time to replace the blinds with curtains.

         This is it, my herb garden. My first attempt at keeping a plant in some years. Apartment life doesn't afford much garden activity, so I figured this pot with the holy trinity (sage, rosemary and thyme) would do well. I probably  would have  done great, had i kept with the watering and upkeep. All I managed to reap from it before it's quick death was a few stems of thyme, and a few branches of rosemary. The sage was claimed quick by powdery mildew so I didn't get a chance at all to use it, but I only use sage when I'm making stuffing. The whole thing served as a great doorstop while the painters were here, but it got knocked around by the window installers, and well, completely neglected by me over the last few months.  I should have known that since I was actually able to kill a pothos plant, that an herb garden was out of the question. Remind me of this next time I get a grand green-thumby idea, will ya?

      i'm the luckiest girl with the coolest side-job in the world.  (it's a job that i don't even consider a job; it's more like a hobby where i'm on the payroll)  i work in a kitchen shop (not just any kitchen shop, seattle's PREMIERE kitchen shop). as if that weren't enough, i get to assist with classes where famous local chefs come in from around town to chat with students and show them neat tricks. now, don't take that to mean that i get to chop stuff up and bake things and stuff like that, because that's not waht i do. instead, i get to serve (and drink) wine and water and gourmet food to interested parties. i also get to wash a ton of dishes, but i don't really mind that part. it's like being inside my television when the food channel is on. it's so fucking cool. the time goes so fast, and i learn so much, and i'd probably be there anyway if i weren't an employee since their class schedule is so amazing.  this last month has given me large hints about what field i want to work in when i get laid off next month (a giant step considering i was aimless til now). adminstrative functions are what i crave because i enjoy the support role and love the feeling of being needed by the people i'm working with, but i have learned that i really would like to work in the hospitality field. my resume went out last week to a large cruise company and a very ritzy downtown hotel, both for "administrative assistant to the culinary/banquet director" positions. tuesday i interview with the hotel -- they've filled the position, but wish to interview me anyway. i take that only for good.  the only drawback to this current side job is that i get home after 10pm and am WIRED like you wouldn't believe (well, maybe you would believe it since you're currently reading this rambling) so I don't crash til after midnight. i'm not sure that this will work when i get a real daytime job again. since currently i pretty much can come and go as i please, it will be an adjustment... but definitely a worthwhile adjustment.

      after saturday's visit to the farmer's market (and despite the heat), i hung out in the kitchen and made two things that i'm totally proud of.   the first and most yummy thing was some raspberry freezer jam. now, i've made jam before and it's been ok, but never this good. i purchased a half flat of raspberries that they claimed were picked that morning. they were so delicious. all i did was follow the instructions on an envelope of pectin specifically for freezer jam - it called for 4 cups of mashed fruit, 1.5 cups of sugar and the pectin. usually it's the other way around -- waaay more sugar than fruit. this recipe is so yum (and a bit tart!), i don't need bread or anything to go with the resulting jam -- just a spoon and the jar and i'm good. of course i'll be visiting the farmers market again soon so I can make another batch.   to break in the le creuset, i made a garlic chicken stew sort of dish that was served over mashed potatoes. it was created loosely based on a recipe i saw online.  basically, i chopped half a sweet onion, and about 8 or 9 cloves of garlic and sauteed it in about a tablespoon of butter and a tablespoon of olive oil. while it was getting soft and translucent, i chopped up two raw chicken breasts and added them to the pot, stirring occasionally. after it was mostly cooked, i added a can of chicken stock and some salt and pepper to taste and let it lightly bubble (with the lid on) for about an hour. once our tummies started grumbling a bit, i added some chopped italian parsley to the pot and let it all boil down about a third of the way. some corn starch helped to thicken it a bit. we heated up some mashed potatoes (idahoan instant mashed in the envelope are really quite good on a day when you don't want to be boiling a GIANT pan of water) and served it up. yummy garlicky goodness!!

      there is definitely some good that comes out of having a weekend filled with sweltering, stifling, suffocatingly oppressive heat -- now 75 degrees actually feels quite pleasant, rather than obnoxiously warm. (yes, i am a weather-wimp, thanks!).

      so much for catching Donnie Darko today... it's at MIDNIGHT, not noon as I had previously thought. i think seeing the director's cut in the theatre is just not in our cards since we've made several unsuccessful attempts.  i did make it over to the magnolia farmers market today to catch our chef's demonstration. i ended up bringing home a half flat of beautiful raspberries, a yummy treat for each of us, and three bulbs of garlic (garlic chicken is on tonight's menu -- i get to christen the le creuset today! yay!)  it's nice to lay around the relatively cool apartment with the cats and food tv. i'm going to have to put some clothes on to go next door for dinner ingredients, though.   stay cool!

      i met the husband downtown after work this evening for dinner and some shopping. after a meal at elephant and castle, we headed to urban outfitters to find a present for a friend's 40th birthday tomorrow (he's the coolest 40 year old hipster I know). i decided on&nbsp;an I&nbsp;heart New York t-shirt (wherein the&nbsp;heart is actually a&nbsp;hand giving the devil rocker throwing goat sign)&nbsp;and we were on our way to nordstrom, then back to pacific place where the car was parked. naturally i had to go into williams-sonoma to browse (hello, i work in a kitchen store and&nbsp; still  can't get enough)&nbsp;and check their le creuset prices, and nearly wet myself with glee when i found  urlLink the very piece  i've been stalking, for $47.99 (usually on special there for $70, and double that&nbsp;everywhere else). now, all we need is some sub-80 degree weather and i'm ready to make a kickass stew or something.   after all of that excitement, we headed up north to northgate for some dairy-queen badness and then over to the mega-target for some wrapping paper and other necessities. now i'm trying to make myself tired so i can get up and be at the laundromat by 8am.   this weekend is chock full o'plans. besides the aforementioned 40th birthday party tomorrow evening, we're planning on seeing donnie darko (at the varsity) and napoleon dynamite (2nd viewing, need to see the wedding footage!) at the metro, both in the U-District. Sunday we'll explore fremont and take the ice cream cruise and see the farmer's market and take pictures all day... maybe followed by throwing a couple steaks on the grill in the afternoon/evening. so busy, but full of nothing but fun, just as the weekend should be!   enjoy yours!!

      At exactly 6am (by my clock, anyway), the alarm went off and Pat Cashman's voice woke me up. All he had time to say, before I hit the snooze button, was "the government warns of possible terrorist attacks this Fall".  What a way to wake up. Not because of the possibility of a terrorist attack (isn't&nbsp;that&nbsp; always  a possibility?), but for the fear-mongering that we're being subjected to. Myself, I fear nothing (except spiders and, well, &nbsp;large bugs in general)... if they happen, they happen. There's not a whole lot I can do to prevent something like that (since I don't pirate music or buy/sell drugs). I'm not going to hole myself up inside my apartment, shaking in my boots, because something  could  happen.   No way.   How many times has this been predicted in the past (almost)&nbsp;three years? And what exactly has happened in those (almost) three years (besides the obvious)?   How is this announcement any different than the previous announcements? I'm thankful that I didn't put my life aside all this time, simply so I could fear the unknown.  It's all so very&nbsp;ridiculous.

      For more than a week now, I've had great intentions of writing this wonderful recap of our San Francisco trip. All I've been able to post so far are some pictures on my  urlLink photolog , and the RiBity series below. I expect that I'll be posting pictures from the trip off and on, so I'll just&nbsp;explain about that part of the trip whenever I put up a picture or two.   Since it's unlikely that I'll ever sit down and write a full-fledged review of our trip, let me just list some of the highlights:    introducing Mark to the&nbsp;Country Cousin Restaurant&nbsp;(in Centralia, WA) -- a long standing family tradition.   riding the BART to Berkeley -SFMoMA in all its glory -visiting Alcatraz (a real surprise since I wasn't really excited about going)    urlLink seeing  my first ever Keith Haring public art!   stumbling upon  urlLink KidRobot  in the Haight and developing an instant addiction to  urlLink small   urlLink expensive   urlLink toys    getting off the freeway in Mountain View (on our way to Santa Cruz) to find Google, and finding it! we didn't show our true geek colors and&nbsp;get out and take any pictures or anything -- they had someone at the parking lot entrance questioning visitors so we headed back to the freeway   meeting more&nbsp;of my&nbsp;husband's family! (cousin and partner, this time!)   &nbsp; Life is busy these days, what with my full time job (sitting at my desk surfing the web all day), my part time job (assisting with cooking classes), and a new hobby... I'm always looking for fun crafty things to try. Usually I end up buying a ton of supplies and never quite get fully into it right away.   urlLink This  blogger has&nbsp;inspired me&nbsp;to try embroidery and found that I really like it, and I think that's because I can get away with doing small projects which keep my attention, rather than taking on something gigantic and losing interest an hour into it.&nbsp;Thanks, Receptionista! (Visit her  urlLink company site  and buy some goods!!! Her designs are adorable and original!)   Since I'm not busy at work these days, I'll try to bring in some photos from SF to manipulate and post. I know you can hardly wait. :-/&nbsp;

      1) reason 4,586 that I love Seattle: it just rained harder than I've seen it rain in a very long time, yet five minutes later, the sky is clear and blue and the only clouds present are white and fluffy and non-threatening.  2) finished product, as it will be presented (assuming it makes it across Seattle from Magnolia to Maple Leaf.

      I'm sitting here at work, bored out of my skull, reading " urlLink A Cook's Tour " by  urlLink Anthony Bourdain . This part of the book was just begging to be blogged.   "Oysters, by the way, are bisexual in ways undreamed of by career-minded actors. They actually change sex from year to year. If you were to tell an oyster, 'Go fuck yourself,' it would probably not be offended. The males of a particular year spew their reproductive juices into the water in a generalized, omni-directional way -- a ubiquitously impregnating cloud that fertilizes whatever's female that year..."   Um... eeeeeewwww. :)

      Inspired by both my attempt at pie crust, and the kickass tart class I helped with on Saturday, last night I decided to make a key lime tart with a pate sucree crust. Instead of giving you a wordy entry (yes, all three of you who stumble across this, searching for naked fremont solstice parade photos), I photographed each step, starting with the making of the Key Lime Curd.  Mise en place: curd    Finished curd    Mise en place: crust    Waiting for the crust to chill    Pate sucree disc    Dough in tart pan    Baked shell    Ungarnished Key Lime Tart    Since this is for a barbecue that's happening tonight (perfect day to finally get my rain storm, ugh), I won't garnish it til right before I get there. My plan of action: Reddi-whip around the edge, and a dollop in the middle, topped with a slice of lime.  And despite how the photo looks, the crust is not burnt... just well done. :) Some parts of the edge are thinner than the others. Also, I ground up some sugar in the raw and used that in place of caster sugar.  Mmmm!

      Since I was wee, cooking has been a main interest of mine. I remember making gnocchi in high school (not even really knowing what gnocchi was at that time), and egg bread when in middle school. The first recipe I ever attempted on my own was peanut butter cookies in grade 5. Sixteen years, countless loaves of bread, thousands of cookies and a handful of cakes later, I decided it was time to attempt pie crust.   After work Wednesday, I came home, got out the cuisinart and went to town. Loosely* using  urlLink Alton Brown's method , I pulsed the flour and salt together a couple times, followed by adding the butter and giving it a few go-arounds, finally adding small amounts of ice water. I put the dough crumblies into a large ziplok bag, formed the mass into a disc and threw it in the fridge to rest.  As the dough rested, I put together some simple chocolate ganache, using 8 oz of heavy cream and 10 oz of  urlLink Ghirardelli  semi-sweet chocolate chips (heat the cream on the stove, just to a bubble. take off the heat and stir in chocolate chips until smooth).  We went for some Thai food (green curry for me, panang for him) and came back and I rolled out the pie dough.   Now, I knew I just needed enough to line my smallish tart pan, so I wasn't too worried. Cutting the sides off of the ziplok and rolling the dough out from there proved impossible on my countertops (as usual, I'd forgotten I had a  urlLink Silpat , which would have made the job much easier), so I sprinkled some flour on the counter and rolled it out into a shape that in no way resembled something that would easily fit into my tart pan. But that's ok! I laid out what would easily fit in and then filled in the gaps with the scraps. Using a fork I poked holes in the bottom of the dough and put it back into the freezer to chill while the oven preheated. I impatiently lingered around the kitchen while I waited for the crust to bake (I did not want my first attempt to burn!).   Once it was done, I let it rest for a bit, then threw it into the fridge to cool. Still impatient, I pulled it out, filled it with the ganache and garnished the whole thing with some sliced almonds. Back into the fridge to cool and set and then about 20 minutes later we cut into the thing and tried it.  The pie crust was flaky and had a good flavor. The ganache was rich but too-much resembled chocolate chips (next time I think I'll try milk chocolate). I am pleased with the results of my first attempt. Next time I attempt to make pie crust, I will work more confidently. The trick is to work quick and minimal, but enough to get things done. I think I could have pulsed the dough crumblies a few more times because there were some large chunks of butter scattered throughout the dough. All in all, I'm happy. :)   *I say loosely because I used all unsalted butter rather than part butter/part lard. I also did not use beans while blind baking the shell. I chose to follow his recipe because I viewed the episode of Good Eats where he uses this method. I'm a visual person. It worked.

      instead of merely teasing us, i wish the sky would just let 'er rip! i was so pleased as i drove to my interview yesterday, with tiny sprinkles hitting my car. when i got out of the interview, the sky had broken and was bright blue! so come on, weather, let it pour! let's get it over before the weekend!

      how sad is it that i would have preferred to stay home and clean the kitchen than come to work today?  in the 5.5 hours i've been here today, i've probably spent no more than 25 minutes doing actual work. and while this might sound like a good set up, consider that i have 21 more identical days before i get to depart (and have probably spent the last 20 days doing the same). the novelty is quickly wearing off, folks.  please send magazines, crossword puzzles, and safe-for-work websites. :)

      last night, we were fortunate enough to be able to attend  urlLink Rusty Chef , a local Iron-Chef-like competition to benefit  urlLink FareStart .   how does it work? two preselected home-cooks are given kitchen space, a mystery basket of food and a limited amount of time to create a three course meal. initially they're given 12 minutes to come up with their menu, then they have to stick with it. after finding out what the mystery basket included, i am so happy i was not a contestant. items included: unagi (eel!), ground veal, yucca, millet, corn flakes, mission figs, eggs, cassaba melon, penne pasta, skate wings, and a host of other oddities. they were allowed to omit one item from the basket, but they lost points for any other items that weren't used. they also had a whole pantry complete with staples such as flour, sugar, oils, soy sauce, fish sauce etc...  having never been to benefit-type event, we weren't sure what to expect or how to dress, really. we got kind of gussied up -- skirt and sweater for me, slacks and dress shirt for him. we fit somewhere right in the middle of the spectrum as there were people super dressed up, and others in jeans. as the rusty chefs were busy cooking, we wandered back and forth between kitchens, outside, and around the counters with the silent-auction items. a couple items looked really good and were tempting to bid on, but we limited it to two items: a Chef'n/Farestart basket (with mini chopper, salt mill and some farestart attire), and a Chef'n gadget collection (after all, you can never have enough gadgets, right??). we got outbid on the basket but I ended up winning the gadget collection (i was the only bidder and my initial bid was the highest you could go!). needless to say, I'm excited to get home and do some cooking! too bad our kitchen is the size of a postage stamp.  eventually, it was time for the rusty chef winner to be announced. we listened to the emcee thank all the sponsors and discuss the benefactor. there was much applause, and then some more, and finally the winner was announced. it was the guy that we both figured would win -- his menu was more solid and he finished two minutes early. he won a $200 santoku knife and a series of cooking classes at culinary communion (i plan on taking their saturday baking series!).  we got home around 10pm. i modeled the rusty chef apron that mark bought me, and then we went to sleep. it was a very fun event, and i think we'll try to attend next year's round!

      Since I was wee, cooking has been a main interest of mine. I remember making gnocchi in high school (not even really knowing what gnocchi was at that time), and egg bread when in middle school. The first recipe I ever attempted on my own was peanut butter cookies in grade 5. Sixteen years, countless loaves of bread, thousands of cookies and a handful of cakes later, I decided it was time to attempt pie crust.   After work Wednesday, I came home, got out the cuisinart and went to town. Using (loosely) Alton Brown's method, I pulsed the flour and salt together a couple times, followed by adding the butter and giving it a few go-arounds, finally adding small amounts of ice water. I put the dough crumblies into a large ziplok bag, formed the mass into a disc and threw it in the fridge to rest.  As the dough rested, I put together some simple chocolate ganache, using 8 oz of heavy cream and 10 oz of Ghirradeli semi-sweet chocolate chips (heat the cream on the stove, just to a bubble. take off the heat and stir in chocolate chips until smooth).  We went for some Thai food (green curry for me, panang for him) and came back and I rolled out the pie dough.   Now, I knew I just needed enough to line my smallish tart pan, so I wasn't too worried. Cutting the sides off of the ziplok and rolling the dough out from there proved impossible on my countertops (I'd forgotten I had a Silpat, which would have made the job much easier), so I sprinkled some flour on the counter and rolled it out into a shape that in no way resembled something that would easily fit into my tart pan.
