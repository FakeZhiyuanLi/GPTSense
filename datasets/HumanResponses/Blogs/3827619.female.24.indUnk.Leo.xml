      You'll be pleased to here that I am actually in a good mood. From this blog you may think that I am a miserable old cow and all I do is moan. I think that my most profound moments come when I am miserable or drunk so I'd just like to say that at present, I am neither.  I have just been so busy over the last couple of days because there is so much to sort and so little time to do it in! I have arranged my flights to Qingdao via Singapore and a three day break in Shanghai. Flying out on Friday 13th - very brave move there.  It really hot out there at the moment so I've bought myself a new pair of flip flops (or thongs as the kiwis call them) just to get in the spirit of things. I also have just had my eyes tested, and&nbsp;am having a second round of injections in a minute. Then there's the flat to sort, my bank account, my tax return, my Chinese visa... phew! Its quite hard work actually!  I nearly jacked it all in on Monday. Talking to a girl who spent four months working at the school in Dongying, I didn't exactly get a&nbsp;glowing report&nbsp;of how great it was. Rather more a summary of all the things that went wrong and why she ended up teaching 60 kids at a time... I really freaked out and nearly ripped my contract up. But then I met Katherine, who will be my boss in China and I told her I was scared and she put many of my worries to rest. I think she will be a great help to me and I am now very comfortable about going. Also, I've had lots of supportive emails from my friends telling me that they think its great and that they can see me doing that kind of thing really well.  So I'm a happy bunny. Only thing is, I have to spend my birthday alone. Oh well, I'm sure Katherine mentioned something about Canadian teachers up at the university so maybe I'll just have to go and seek them out...

      Everytime I decide to enter something on this site, I am hungover, or tired, or just generally suffering the after effects of an excessive night out on the fizzy pop. Well I suppose I can't use the excuse that I am still celebrating my job in China, but its a good enough reason for me.    A few things have happened since last week so let me tell you about them...    Last Saturday night, the rubgy was in town. The Bledisloe cup, where the All Blacks plays the Aussies was being staged in Wellington. In order to secure a good seat, we got to the pub at around 5.30pm and disgusting as it is, I didn't leave the pub until 6am the next morning! 12 hours in a bar is not something I should be proud of, but I am.    Anyway, New Zealand won, which was just excellent, and as I am an honorary kiwi, I felt it necessary that I should celebrate in a similar fashion to everyone else.    We left one bar only to enter another and so continued the evening, until we decided at 2am that Burger King was a crucial part of the nights events. This could have been the best or worst decision ever bearing in mind the following events. It was a travesty, in as much as the people we had been with went into the next bar which turned out to be staging the All Blacks victory party. Gosh, I love those rugby players as well - so that was pretty annoying.    The next thing, we are in Kitty O'Sheas (the Irish bar on Courtenay Place) and I meet this guy. Hell, he was hansome! and I spent the next 4 hours talking to him and dancing and generally being a giggly girlie. The stupid thing, is he wanted to see me again (which I couldn't truly believe) so although some thieving gypsie swiped my mobile and wallet (disguntled Aussie fans no doubt) he gave me his phone number and said we'd meet up.    Well, we have and I still like him which is stunning for me as I usually go right off people once the initial attraction wears off. And I hope that I will see him again but CAN YOU BELIEVE after all my years of being institutionally single, that I actually meet someone when I just about to leave the fecking country for a long stint! Thats just a bit pants really.    Anyway, it's not the end of the world, and I'm certainly not going to stay behind for him because that would be mad. I always have my back up plan ready and waiting if I do end up old and alone - get a dog.    Tonight there is another rugby match on (All Blacks/South Africa) - its the Tri nations and so I may be going back to a pub again for more frivolity and self-abuse. I thank God that I have a strong constitution and hope that one day I will stop being such a drunkard.    Other items of news for you:       I had my innoculations for China - they gave me three injections and a medical exam, poking me, prodding me, sticking things in my ears, shining thing in my eyes, then they have the cheek to charge me $350 for the pleasure and tell me to come back in a week for another round of ritualistic torture.     Finished at Fonterra on Friday, they gave me the Rough Guide to China as a leaving pressie which was very kind as I wasn't expecting anything. It was actually quite emotional - I've made some really good friends there.     Going to try and get my Chinese visa on Monday and am also going to the Total English school here to observe and teach in some lessons.     The nice chap I met took me for a drive around the Wellington locality that I hadn't seen before - Island Bay and all that (look at a map!) and it was really beautiful. So glad I got to see that before I left...    Feeling quite emotional from time to time about leaving. I will miss Manisha, incredibly - she has been such a good mate and has just made me feel so much at home. Oh well, I suppose I'll come back one day...

      Well, there you go.  &nbsp;  I can't believe its happened but I am going to&nbsp;China in about three weeks time.  &nbsp;  I got the teaching job I was after and I'm so scared but made up about it also! Basically, I applied for this job because the money was really good and I thought it'd be good to do the whole teaching position/applying for thing for experience and after two interviews and a practical teaching session (my first ever teaching experience) they still want me!  &nbsp;  I will be working in Dongying, which is a small city(?) of about 2 million people about 4 hours drive south east of Beijing and just below the Huang He river. I think it can be a pretty inhospitable place in as much as it is industrial and an oil field - also, very few trees and no hills around for miles! Have I sold this place to you yet?!?  &nbsp;  But there is so much going for it that I don't know where to begin!! This is just so out of the blue though and so not on my action plan that I don't actually think it has sunk in yet. And it probably won't until I get off the plane in China and go "OH MY GOD!!!! WHAT HAVE I DONE!!!!"&nbsp; &nbsp;  Anyway, I am still learning the details about this job and I still haven't signed the contract so its not 100% for sure but I'll keep you posted on developments...

      Hey there! Well, one more week in Wellington gone and my work is getting a bit dreary. I really have got the teaching bug at the moment and am trying to look for wild and exotic places to go and work. China is in at the moment and today I had a practical lesson I had to take for one of the jobs I am going for. Well, I guess most teachers first lessons don't take place under interview conditions - well mine did! I was absolutely fine until the five Japanese students came into the room and then I started to get really nervous! I must say though, that I actually quite enjoyed myself, and although it was rally important to be clear about things and make myself understood, I found it easier to do knowing their level of English. So glad my first 40 minute lesson is over though and I have much more of an idea as to what to do next time.  Other interesting developments... Logging on to Yahoo the other day and in the head lines to the left hand side was the title "Lisa Simpson Backs Cornish Freedom Fight" or something like that!!! I was so proud. Apparently a 'Cornish comedian' (probably Jethro) captured the interest of one of the Simpson producers and so they are planning to mouth off about Cornwall getting the same status as Wales and Scotland in being defined as separate from England. About blooming time!!  Anyway, that's my first highly charged entry on this blog, but I'm sure it won't be the last.   Also, hope to get my picture on here next time so you can all gaze upon my cheeky smile again soon.

      My head hurts.  Everytime, I say I'll never do it again and yet I seem to forget by the next weekend.  You've guessed it - I have a hangover. It wasn't my fault, because people kept buying me drinking and there was a live band and lots of dancing and I finally got to bed at 7.15 this morning! Yes - 7.15!!!  It was a really good night actually, except that my friend Manisha deserted me at about three. I ended up chatting to a few strays for the rest of the night - an evening with an international flavour with a Dutch man, an Irish man and two Frenchmen all having to put up with my inane drivel on setting the world to rights!  I think I accused the French blokes of faking it and not actually being French but this was because of their OUTRAGEOUS accents.  So how did this night of debauchery happen?  Well, last week I finished my TESOL course and really, really enjoyed it. Also, I am fed up of my temping job in Wellington and I want to go and do something a bit different. The TESOL teacher gave me a job advert for a really well paid Teaching position in China, and I applied - interview on Wednesday.  So I've started researching China now and actually think I'd really like to go. I've never really thought about it before, but it would be such a fantastic experience and just so different from anything that I have ever known.  Anyway, I out my CV on the Teaching website and have had a few responses already, because they are simply crying out for English teachers in China. But on Friday I was cold called by a lady in Wellington who works for an agency that sends teachers to China. I had a meeting with her yesterday and she offered me work on the spot. OK, so the money isn't as good but the school is excellent and I have contacted some of the old teachers from there and they have all said that its a really good school to work for.  Lets face it, money is important, but it isn't what drives me, so do I just go for it?  So I'm drowning in options at the moment and I have never felt so wanted!! (I'll save that explanation for another time)  I'm going to have to go and eat something soon or I may throw up, I'm not is a good place at the moment...

      This is my blog.  I really want to put on some of my thoughts from my last six months travelling and I suppose I should start at the beginning so please be patient for me to get around to doing this! Keep an eye on this page for some exciting news though!

      Just visited the Karori Wildlife Sanctuary which is located just on Wellington's outskirts. There was a storm when I woke up this morning and I really didn't think I was going to be able to go but it has turned into such a beautiful day!!  I have been trying to get there since I arrived, but I am such a slacker that I never managed it. Mind you, I am really glad I did - it is really tranquil and very pretty... idyllic even. It is a sanctuary for rare New Zealand birds and they have a bloody great fence around it to keep out all predators. There are also two reservoirs and it just makes a perfect little country jaunt without having to go too far off the beaten track.  It gave me a bit of space to think also... yes, you must have realised by now that I leave NZ in two days. I am lurching between excitement and depression. I knew New Zealand wasn't going to be my permanent home, but I am having to leave my comfort zone again. I steadied myself last night by reading my diary from when I left the UK and I must say that I was surprised at how much I had forgotten about that - my current emotions mirror my diary from then!  I think my biggest fear at the moment is the language barrier. I'm kind of wishing I'd bothered to learn a bit more Mandarin before I left... I mean, how the hell am I going to be able to tell what I am eating in restaurants when I can't even read the menu! I don't think I would cope if I subsequently found out that I had eaten monkeys brains!  We went to watch Fahrenheit 9/11 last night and as you can imagine, I got suitably irate over the content. I actually felt quite ashamed watching it... I was about to launch into a tirade of opinionated drivel, but you will be thankful that I just pulled myself back from that!  I really hope that I can keep adding to this in China. I really have no concept as to the level of censorship that takes place on the internet there so I may be buggered and never be able to add anything again!  If not, "Zaijian!"

      The first part in dealing with alcoholism is admiting you have a problem.  Well, I do. Christ, it was a Wednesday night and I still managed to end up half cut in a bar until four am. China is definitely going to have to be an exercise of self restraint in the drinking department. I kind of visualise myself doing Tai Chi on the lawn and finding inner peace and all that pants and hopefully I'll shake this behaviour that has me recollecting University memories of constant drunkardness.  My poor little liver must actually be groaning under the pressure of it and I am bloody tired now.  I had another damn jab in the arm earlier this morning and I'm due for several more on Saturday (whoopie) so I'm looking forward to that - not. It was quite funny actually, because I got all my blood and other bodily fluid results back today. All fine, but the doctor said I must have been really dehydrated when the tests were done as my sodium levels were really high. I expect they have cottoned on to the fact that I am constantly hungover when I go to their surgery so I am actually suprised that my tests didn't reveal tha alcohol courses through my veins rather than blood.  Anyway, I am even boring myself with this entry so God knows that you must be thinking about it... I'll leave you in peace now.

      Any excuse for a jaunt to the pub eh? From this blog, so far I think we have established that I am a bit of an old soaker and every entry comes with a brief account of drunken despair.  Well, I am leaving soon and it would be rude to refuse the hospitality of my Kiwi flatmates and friends. So Friday night roles around again and we end up in the Diva bar as usual, only I seem to be a little more drunk than usual.  It was a very funny evening by all accounts but mainly because I kept falling over. Oh dear. Don't you just hate it when that happens. I think the most amusing part of it was the fact that I kept saying to my friend Manisha, "I think I'm going to fall over" and she would just say ok and then I actually would fall over.  I figured that this was probably a good time for me to leave as things were just getting embarrassing, but what I can't work out is how I then ended up in Kitty O'Sheas until four am drinking with a couple of Kiwi rugby players (ever so fit as well!). Now how about that for a result! Anyway, the drunken workings of my mind are a mystery and I think its best that I just accept the course of events that occurred.  Yesterday, though I still managed to get back in the pub by lunchtime... Well, Mike Tyson was fighting Danny Williams and I really enjoy watching Tyson get a pounding. If there's one bloke on earth who deserves a good smack in the mouth then it's Tyson.  What staggers me is the fact the so many people revere him as this great guy and support him during the fight, and yet he's a dirty, ear biting, under hand, woman beating rapist and a big thug to boot. There were loads of people in the bar supporting Tyson and so I took great delight in yelling my lungs out for the other guy - who just happened to be a Brit too! Tyson got knocked out in the fourth round - I was so chuffed and was bouncing off the walls, but of course this set us up for an afternoon of drinking and playing pool.  Well, it seemed stupid to go home for the seven hours in between the boxing match and the Wallabies versus the Springboks, and yes, we stayed in the pub instead.  I'm trying to find a hotel room in Shanghai now and I think I'm sorted. I can't believe that there is only 12 days to go before the big "off". I'm going over to one of the teachers who worked at Dongying's house for tea this afternoon and she is going to show me the photos of her time there. Anyway, must go and get something to eat I think to try and sort my incredible beer gut out.
