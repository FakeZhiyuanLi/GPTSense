      bought slippers yesterday.  those kinds usually worn by mountaineers like myself.  i liked it by the way red and blue and black splash their pizzaz on the strap.  still a bit foreign with my sole though, but eventually, it would have to groove.    i told ninin, that it would be some kind of a ritual of sorts to get the slippers.  a kind of making the feet more able to go forward, to explore new nooks and crannies, to run and walk and to visit more interesting places.  and so it happened, yesterday and the next few days would certainly be that.  lets start off with yesterday. well yesterday, i watched shrek2 with tatit, ninin and mehane, a whole lot of laughs.   siguro mababaw lang talaga ko...  but the new thing there is a phone call from an old friend in manila.  she felt so warm and i kinda missed her too. those things that we used to talk about.  brought back a lot of memories.  is this my feet's way of telling me of possibilities?    but no, maybe not yet, not all adventures are worth going into... at least not yet. :)  but before i went home, went to mts, well to drink coffee and read saturday's paper, by myself.  twas musicians night at taboan and they were in the side, as i buried myself with old news and new harry potter showing trivia.  to do something so alone has not happened recently.  i felt solitude, being nameless, faceless and anonymous.  new feelings, but good feelings.  today, a monday, i started with a little bounce, for i have resolved to let things the way they are at the office.  i can never change agnes' style.  i should just shut up (like dilangalen) and just do my job. and still support agnes with the stuff she should be doing.  maybe instead of writing this blog, i should already burying myself at that pef proposal.  and tomorrow, i move to my new room! excited, anxious, but looking forward to more adventures for me and my new slippers.

      yey!  its friday!  i join the workforce in celebrating and regalling the best day of all!!!    never mind if i had no breakfast... i usually dont have time for it.  never mind if te baby is all fumes because of me not coming early (...enough).  she isn't very welcoming in the morning when you come in anyway.  never mind if my neck feels a little bit strange and i have to crink it every so often.  never mind if the pef proposal is still proceeding snail's pace, i am still trying to understand how it goes anyway.  never mind if the 10th year celebration is not in the consciousness of people in the office, at least when somebody asks me what to do, i have something to show.  never mind that we still have to do 5s later this afternoon.  for today i have no plans...  never mind that i feel so shitty about work.  i'll probably be moving on next year, or earlier.  this is what matters.  today is the last day of the week!   later, we'll be going out to get our paychecks.  then halo halo after that.  then friday music.  then the weekend at last.  i find it so happy to say those magical words "happy weekend!" that signal what has been a struggle and the rest and recreation in the next two days.  because when the weekend kicks in, it would be Bob Marley look alike contest later.  laundry tomorrow morning... the gush of water, the fragrant smell of soap and downy, the sight of watching water drip from the clothes, and the reflections that go along with it.  watch a futbol match in the afternoon... someone's love is playing.  muvy perhaps in the evening... shrek2.  sleep. sleep. sleep on sunday.  or probably macro shopping...  intertwined would be efforts of finding a place for ninin, tatit and mehane.  o well, its only 10am and my mind is all set.  and this is when i say....  "happy weekend!"

      finally got my place... a small room, and a bathroom that adjoins to another room, nothing much, still it would be home.  finally.  it was a postponed joy, i feel that this should have happened last year.  but davao has a way of letting you be.  no regrets.  the jvp house has been good to me.  it has taken cared of me and has shared with me events that has ranged from the mundane to the important ones.  i leave with gratitude.    i also leave looking forward to the life before me.  now i know how capt. john smith must have felt as he gazed to what is ahead, while listening to pocahontas belt out "beyond the river bend."  the path has been laid down, but is still unchartered.  more surprises are prepared, and the adventure advances...

      more than two years have passed since this picture was taken.  i came across it as i was rummaging through our jvp23 yahoogroups.  since the pre-orsem of our batch the staff have been mentioning that i look just like aleish, my so "called twin sister" in the picture.  i didnt see her yet then, but was quietly anticipating the meeting.  and the meeting did happen, right after the manila local comm send off mass, there she was.  i would have said no, and insisted on my individuality.  but the similarity is just so uncanny, maybe its the hair, or the complexion, or the smile, or a combination of all things.  over time i kinda convinced myself that a replica of me can exist.  i am reading "angels and demons" by dan brown right now.  and i must say that i have been hooked on it since sunday, when i first got hold of it.  after 50 chapters or so of reading, one idea that i remembered the most is the principle of "duality,"  that nothing can exist without its exact opposite.  the yin and yang, night and day, hot and cold, black and white.  inhale and exhale, and yes to some extent man and woman.  as the picture and the memories attach to it revive, i remember that dualities exist because they are expressions to the concept of "balance."  i have been pretty alien to the term, maybe because, physically i lack equilibrium.  it's quite difficult for me to walk straight on a balancing rod, my left shoulder is lower than my right, my left eye smaller than my right, and so on.    however, it has been presented to me time and again, in levels above than what is obvious.  like girlie talking about the law of compensation (acute sense of hearing and not having a boyfriend), or rey and vinchie advising about "bumabad ka sa area" and "wag kalimutan ang sarili."    but at the end of the day, it could probably mean one thing.  that persons are not meant to be alone.  there is someone out there for me.  last night, as ninin and myself were having dinner she asked me "makakahanap pa kaya ako ng bahay?"  "oo naman," i blurted out.  then jokingly, "e boypren?"  i said somberly, "there is someone meant for you, and there is someone meant for me..."  with that i gripped my faith again and wished for the twin of my heart.  the one who will balance me... and would somehow set things right with me.     urlLink    twins&nbsp; urlLink

      i always thought of myself as an achiever.  someone who works real hard in order to get the goals of organization and of self.  not until i worked in aadc did that thought was confirmed.    see, one of the mantras of the organization is "know oneself."  and as a tool of doing just that is the enneagram.  and i wasn't surprised at all, when i came out as a three,  urlLink the achiever .  Briefly, three's like me are "The Success-Oriented, Pragmatic Type: Adaptable, Excelling, Driven, and Image-Conscious" type, like ipe, sting, michael jordan and arnold schwarzeneger.    here are the few things that i got from it:  1. that the most important thing is to be  true .  true to the inner voice of the heart.  true to my calling.  image is nothing.  what i try to project to the world are actually the up side of my insecurities, frailties and vulnerabilities.    2. life is meant for living.  the drive for achieving in me, tends to capture my whole being, even to the confines of my personal life.  i often hear my mentor telling me to let the work become structured, because that is how it should be.  and to let life flow, because that is how it should be as well.  3. i work with a powerhouse. orlan is a one,  urlLink a reformer , while rhea is a five,  urlLink the investigator .  what we have is work relationship that can achieve great things.  that is only if we are able to orchestrate things.    and the journey moves on, as it continues to snake through the twists and turns of life.  more are revealed, with less things to hold on to.  hmmmm life could be so exciting.  -------------------- "knowing oneself is winning half the battle."     sun tzu, art of war

      celeste is a friend of ayen's.  ayen would usually say "sana ma-meet mo rin si celeste..."  well i finally did meet her today.  i heard so much about her, and i think she also heard so much about me.  an exerpt from our introuductions went as:  jerry: ... by the way, i'm jerry celeste: i'm celeste celeste:  ahhhm jerry:  ahhmmm  ... damn memories came rushing in.  good thing i have a lot to do in the last hour.  so i need not dwell on it.  but it haunts me... and it will probably take me a long time to get over it.

      this morning is not any different from the mornings this week.  it feels so cold and so desolate... so alone.  yet something about this week is a little bit queer, different from other weeks.  for this week, i dreamed of two weird dreams.  (and more weird than that, i remembered those dreams).    i am no dream guru, so i would leave the interpretations to experts.  and besides, i think nocturnal dreams are not meant to be analyzed by the dreamer...   dream 1:  gma girlfriend  the details are already quite fuzzy for me now.  but i dreamt last wednesday night, that GMA is my girlfriend.  yep that is right, the reelected president is my lover, and a secret one at that.  i remember in the dreams that she would send for me, whenever i am in town.  apologies though for dirty minds, no bed scenes here.   hehehe, at least i take pride that my dreams are still General Admission.   dream 2: scuba diving in a room  this was just last night.  i dreamt that i have gone scuba diving with sherwin and doc fred.   Hahaha of all the people nu?   after some time of floating and floating, without seeing anything interesting, i suddenly realized that i do not have a tank, much less a regulator on.  i only have my mask on.    my instincts told me to go up for air.  and surprise of all surprises, i only have gone up for only about 10 feet or so, that i hit what seems to be a ceiling.  then i looked around and so a door on a wall... so i dove towards it and turned the knob.  i expected the knob to jam, but no it did not. and i expected to gush out of the room like water from a breaking dam near isengard.  but no, i did not gush, much less flow out of the room.  i walked out of the room.  then i checked myself and i saw myself wearing a wet suit that is... dry.  talk about weird... hehehe

      This is one of my favorite pictures, taken near the summit of Mt. Apo, at the rim of its crater lake last October, 2003.  It surely was nice going up. I felt so alive then, so good to be young and climbing the Philippines highest peak.  Mt. Apo crater in the background...&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

      my fingers type but my thoughts are empty nay... they are not, it seems that my thoughts have  become impenetrable, closed, blocked.  by what? i do not seem to know is it straying away? is it turning its face from me?  or is it just tired of thinking of creating images of describing things of being

      when i started this day, i felt as if i would die by noon.  what with the gazillions of things to do, i feel that making it past noon would already be a victory for me.  and what do you know, it is almost 6:30pm and my vital signs are still ok.  tired, yes. but still able to write.  today, we had our meeting in the morning and in the afternoon, i finished editing a 17-page document about the local economic profile of jabonga, agusan del norte.  well if that term is not yet long enough for you, wait till you read it.  before i go home, i stop and think about how did i make it today.  and i cannot think of any other reason, except, today, relationships were strengthened.  it felt great to get out of the things that i am doing and somehow hear what rhea and orlan has to say about the stuff that they are doing.  it has been nice to be able to just talk with people.  somehow, someway, that made the day easier to walk through... even the lep seemed easier to write.  notwithstanding all the gripes and the bad mouth that the previous writer got from me.  or was she a writer, for that matter?  anyhows, back to this blog.  i realized that no matter how many things that i have to do, or how large is the work load of the team, it would still pay off to have real conversations with them.  some say that people are the most important assets to an organization.  but really, how many of us leaders really pay attention to them.  sometimes, it is easier to just "do our job!" and not to care about the dynamics of a person.    but the whole dynamics comes into play when you know that the movie helen of troy is a real masterpiece, or that early morning nagging really wouldn't work.  how accidents happen, especially to one of us.  how easier it is to stay than to move out.    these stuff, we don't see especially when we have LEPs to popularize, Saliyaw articles to write or websites to finish, vignettes to ask from AMs... etc., etc.  but the real magic happens when the dynamics of a person becomes part of the stuff that needs to be done.  that is when performers rise, and winners emerge.  simple, true, yet often taken for granted.  maybe that is why something so obvious can be so unknown.  and i think only those who can really touch the person other than work level can really become effective leaders in organization.    hopefully, our oie's gets approved tomorrow.

      was it a dream?  but i could have sworn that me and grace were texting each other from 3am up to about 5am this morning.  though there were no text messages to attest to it, there was this feeling that i havent felt in a long while: connection.  the feeling that someone is out there with whom connects with me.  i remember one of my favorite tv ads, the globe commercial wherein each person who is holding a phone gets connected with another through a blue band flying/floating through the air.  it may have been one of the most powerful commercials to date that speaks clearly of a human need... that is almost always not met, or denied in most cases.  i have been in davao for almost two years now.  and for the adventure that i come to realize, i somehow have sacrificed one very important part of my being.  i somehow have forgotten a core value that i hold dear, that is to create bonds with people that matter.  i feel that bonds have been somehow missing these past few days.  and come to think of it, it seems that people that really matter have been quite amiss too.  i have never felt so alone, so untouched, so out of touched ever since i came home after the chicken pox thingy.    i strive to link up even just to network, for i have lost something that is essential to my well being.    that was why, the incident this early morning has likewise been valuable.  it is like talking through animated pauses and texts.  no matter, it was as if, something has stirred inside again.  something jolly has come over me that has made me look forward to this day once more.    the problem is, i just do not know, until when can i keep this feeling intact.  lots of things will be happening the next few days, even now as i write, many things to do are already waiting to be accomplished.    i am kinda figuring out how to end this blog.  somehow, i do not feel a resolution has come over me.  but, i do not also intend to resolve many things about my life. maybe i would just let it be... just another one of those unresolved entries.  "a love song for no one" by john mayer reverberates in my ear.  i think the lines "i'm tired of being along, so hurry up and get here..."  captures everything that i have written here.  don't you think so?

      i cherish sundays.  well, sundays have been special for me.  back in my days in manila, it was a time with the youth in the parish.  now it is a time for me.  usually, it has been a day to recall strength, and a time to prepare for yet another week ahead.    but the best part about sundays is the mystery that it inherently posses.  i maintain, that i would never know what will happen on a sunday.  there is something on a sunday that makes it quite different from all the days of the week.    today is a sunday when i rested... i slept the whole morning after hearing mass.  then just went out to walk around gsis, hoping to catch a new place to stay.  and now just typing away, non-chalantly as if nothing is pressuring me.  sundays are special, maybe because it is a time to go back to the self.  a day to take care of oneself.  so that in the next week ahead, the self can share itself.    o well, i seem to have no point today.  even my writing skills are resting... o well, i just wanted to write.  just wanted to express what is in my head.  just wanted to feel that someone is listening and is there for me...

      JVP Batch 25 volunteers left for their ORSEM at 2am earlier.  they sould be in Cagayan de Oro already, getting ready for their trip to Manila later this afternoon at 4p.  i couldn't help but feel the euphoria of leaving.  i still remember distinctly almost the same time two years ago, when i left for the JVP orsem.  well it wasn't exactly a long journey but i tell you it was a start of one.  i remember how i held Grace's hand that day.  it was like holding the sands of panglao.  soft and fine, yet slipping away... slowly.  i feel the moment is near to let go, yet gently holding on.  i was willing to go and leave everything behind for ten months of adventure.  i look forward to experience the stories of the volunteers who took the plunge ahead of me.  yet, i am even more excited of writing my own story.  of being at the forefront of the twists and turns ahead, of being at the crossroads of choices.  i left that day, but i was not hoping to arrive soon.  and come to think about it... two years down the line, i can still say that i have not arrived.    i have not arrived, simply because i do not know where to arrive at.  funny, i haven't really formulated the question to that.  would i be parking, or staying a while, would i be docking, or would i be settling?  somehow, i do not need to go on asking... maybe because i do not need an answer, not just yet.  i am simply contented with tasting the gift that was freely given.  of bathing myself with the blessing that happened and continue to outpour itself each and everyday of my life.  my destination is uncertain, i think it is even uncharted.  but i somehow got my wish, to be look at twists and turns in the eye and to stand at the crossroads of choices.  god is really good at this job... granting wishes.  now i have my next wish.  i just wish that i would have the courage to go through the the crossroads of choices and not to remain at just looking at them in the eye.   for how would i arrive if i remain at where i am.  when i remember ping, my jvp23 batchmate, i remember that i first heard "padayon" from her.  to continue... to move forward.  and never ever remain.

      damn its early.  my phone was already trying to wake me up at around 5:30am.  whew, 'twas a real struggle getting out of bed.  as if davao was trying to wake me up gently by the cold air that hung around my room like a chandelier.  difficult, that is how my first hour of the morning went.  i logged in at 7:15am.  one of my earliest bouts at the office.  i would be interviewing another AM that would be assigned in ComVal and Agusan.  but am just glad to be home.  to be doing the stuff the i used to do here.  o well, second day at the office, and another long day awaits... interviews, proposal finalization...  so what else is new?

      ahhhh tuesday...  i've got mixed emotions today.  for one, i feel happy for having to have served in the PPCRV yesterday in the elections here in manila.  and happier because i got to do it with grace.  small talk... nothing much.  she seems ok, she seems contended with where she is, and who she is with.  with that, i feel happy for her.  i also feel excited and anxious at the same time.  for today i go home to davao.  had a quick look at the calendar beside our computer and wow... i have been in manila 2 weeks already.  it has to be the longest that i stayed around without doing work.    excited to be finally getting back on the groove.  whew, i feel like a newbie again, like a wide eyed freshman.  anxious, because a meeting is waiting for me with mincode for a major revision of our proposal.  and by the way the meeting starts at 10a... and my flight is at 11:30a.  cool isnt it?  there you go three feelings. but i somehow i think i have just articulated a very very small percentage of what i am truly feeling.  i will just leave it at that first... i need to go to the airport already... i think i need to be early for this flight.

      when i woke up this morning i was in a car... a shirt over my head and a splitting headache smothering my scalp.  it didn't surprise me though, because i know that before i slept i was staggering towards my seat in the car and we had just finished eating bulalo right across the Day's Hotel in TAGAYTAY!  yep, that's right, i was in tagaytay a few hours ago... trying to get as much alcohol in my system as much as i can, trying to run away from nosy policemen trying to implement the liquour ban.  damn my liver hurts...   tagaytay has definitely changed all this time since i was last there.  starbucks is just around the corner.  light is everywhere, and everyone seems to be awake even at 2 in the morning.  in my drunken stupor i was talking about my favorite topic: living.  i was telling claire, aaron, richard and garett how life is like... well drinking beer.  it may be bitter, most of the time... but you kinda like it once you get used to it.  at first you just swallow then close your eyes as hard as you can.  then, you'll realize that its not all that bad.  later, you begin to appreciate the soft malty flavor of the beer in your mouth.  you feel the alcohol evaporating into a smell distinctly its own.  and you smile for another sip of your favorite beer.  a lot like life or living isn't it?  sure life is hard, but when i came to swallow this hard fact, and loose resentments along the way, it dawned on me that life isn't all that bad, or that bitter.  the bitter liquid in brown bottles has been transformed into an elixir that has come to symbolize bonding, being together and celebration.  yeah right, i can always say this, i am a beer drinker.  still take it from me.  the only caveat is the same warning that is posted on beer commercials:  drink moderately.  it is so easy to become an alcoholic if you are not careful.  but such good things are never meant to last.  in life, i think we still cannot be addicted to it.  because there is so much more to it, than what is it now.  no example ever came close to this than my experience with JVP in  2002.    i thought that life is just that, but God proved time and time again that life is so much more than the glitz and glitter of makati.  it is in fact, the faint twinkling of the sky in a clear night.  it is the cool air blowing from a bus, it is the lush green fields of Bukidnon... it is so much more than the world as i knew before joining JVP.  admittedly, the most daunting task for me then, was to let go of what i have.  and to hold on to something or someone new.  and boy, am i glad i did just that.    the JVP experience helped me look at life more than the bottle (figuratively and yes... literally).  there is always more to it than just that.  and it paints a smile on my face because of its richness and its being out of bounds.  at the same time it pains me because of "choice."  there is only one thing that i can choose i cannot have it all.  otherwise, i would be a drunkard like last night trying to funnel beer into my stomach.  and aaron this morning, trying to pump alcohol out of his system.    drink moderately, because there is no such thing as a happy hangover.  and i know, there is always something better than beer.

       so lonely... so lonely... so lonely...   so goes the coffee break island covering a version of the song by the police.  great band... the police, great cover, full of energy, full of reggae!  i was blaring with the band, because i know that deep inside one soul is lonely tonight.  i tried to shrug it off, and took a deep gulp of the beer in front of me, another draft of yosi with the head swinging wildly from side to side.  i hope it can fake enjoyment... i hope it can mask the pain that is inside.  this morning is not different though... i feel even lonelier because i am raring to go home to davao.  but more than anything else, i miss her.  or probably the illusion of taking care of her.  i call it illusion, because it is just that.  an illusion of loving someone, without expecting anything in return.    a loving gaze, a gentle touch, an affectionate longing in my eyes that is almost always met with accurate mislead.  i just smile how she does it so well.  how we would text each other with everything from nonesense to anything from the mind to the heart, and everything in between.  how we would just hang, mostly with her officemate... and one time with the other half of null... ( mejo ouch yon, buti na lang dimsum dinner is there... )  and how she would say "mahal ko sya" to every good artist that she likes.  hahaha eluding everything, but always inviting.  at least that is how i picture her.  i am in no hurry though.  my heart has been bruised and broken.  and i would not want to include her in the misery i am in.  i contend myself with the gaze, the touch, and the longing of being with her.    in the meantime, sting will continue to sing out loud... and my heart beats along with it.   ... and the illusion goes on.

      i spent almost the whole day browsing through the CDs that have accumulated over the months in the past two years.  while listening to each and every one, i have come to observe the varying tastes of my brothers and sisters in the music that they buy.  the genre is wide from the thugy beats of rap and r&b to the somewhat mellow arrive of the love and sentimental songs.  however, what attracted me the most is how all of these can be rendered in acoustic.  it seems that the acoustic rendition has gained quite a big following from the first time i heard it.  i can still remember those sundays when my bro and i awaited for NU107 acoustic events back in 1994.  tis funny how we used to tape them into cassette tapes.  how we tried to keep quiet, thinking that the "recording" would catch our voices.  hehehe, we were quite silly then.  after completing the afternoon, we would be so happy that we would play the tape over and over again.  sometimes we would brag to our classmates how we found a version of "alapaap" (e-heads, then) that is never heard off, because of a line that went may isang donselya (umaga, dapat diba?)  and we'd be proud owners of new things, good things, precious things.  tis funny how things are now.  acoustic is all over.  piracy is very rampant (though i couldn't wash my hands..hehe) and you would hear the same things over and over.  there is something amiss, something that can't be denied.  a little element, factor that has been lost.  the passion for the small detail of life.  it has been lost by mass produced cds, music that has been adulterated by the industry, that is supposed to be making it available to people.  o well, what am i complaining about?  nothing, just wanted to pour out my ramblings and my frustration of not having able to go out... hehe

      ... and on the 7th day He rested.  Thus says a quote from Genesis.  It's been seven days since the virus of the chicken got me.  Now I can say, that I am almost in the path to recovery.  I feel better now, my throat doesn't hurt anymore, my head stopped spinning, the eyes seem to focus better.  My skin is more revived, hair, of course the hair is better flowing.  Hmm, all the signs of getting well properly falling into place.  But I am most glad because, I am smiling again, amidst all of the scars that the pox has given, in spite of all the pain that life has offered me.  When i woke up this morning, I heard that Wing Soriano has a new album out.  Wing is one of my first memories, or should I say, conversation pieces with her.  Without combing my hair, or looking at the mirror, and still with my eyes half closed i texted her and told her that the album is out.  'Tis one of the times, when I know that I acted silly (again), or a jerk (so what else is new?), or a kid who'se having his first crush (what, again and again), or a fool (hahahaha, need i say more?).  But, funny... I was smiling while all of these are happening, and probably doesn't mind being any one of those things.  I am just happy, just happy to  be.    I just want to show someone some affection.  A little concern, a little love... perhaps.  Couln't care less if it is returned, even if it is just brushed off.  I just want to be a friend to this friend.  Today, I smile, not only because of the speedy recovery against the pox, but moreso of the slow beating of my heart, of its very very awkward steps to care and to open up again.    Because the 7th day wouldn't be much different from any other day.  Except this day, he knew he would rest his heart... again.  -----------------------------------  postscript   My mom, read the title of this blog... and she said, your " chicken pox is not an  ordeal.... blah blah blah " forgive me, i failed to catch all of her words.  at any rate, i agree with her... this is not an ordeal... at all. ;j

      the thing about language is that you add a little element and you change the meaning altogether.  for example, insert the letter "s" in the word "making" and we have "masking."    making as in creation, becomes masking as in manipulation.    / / /  wow! one week in manila already.  nothing much isn't it? especially if i was born and raised here.  but what is special is, that i haven't had beer at all, stopped smoking last three days, and have only gone out in two of those nights.  whatever happened to me?  ...i have actually started to feel depressed.    the depression, hanging mostly on one solid trunk:  i feel ugly, and i can't drink, i can't smoke and worse, i can't go out!  this is kinda new for me who has gimik written all over.  i can almost see mehane now. "huuuuhhhh, ikaw nga lang nagturo sa aking uminum ng beer e..."    though, i still won't take up to that honor.  it really is hard to keep gimik at bay.  the lifestyle has deeply engrained itself in every bone, sewed itself to the very threads of my skin, and attatched to the very molecules of the air that i breathe.  hah!  am i making sense?  / / /  or am i just masking sense?  is gimik the thing that i want to be known for?  is it really something that i want to live for?  of course having mustered those questions, necessitates an equal, however tentative, drawing of the answers.  am i ready to face it, would i be ready to face it?

      I start to write down my thoughts today. I must admit that I haven't done this in a long while. It must be the sting of the chicken pox that has evoked my creative juices to flow. See, its been ironic last few days. I have been laughing at myself because i got stuck in manila, but can't go out to meet people. I am at home with nothing to do, but thank God the computer is online.   Or it could be the pain of letting go of someone that has awakened a passion that has somehow slept. I recently decided to part ways with my girlfriend. Only two sundays ago, I closed my eyes and said goodbye. It breaks my heart to do so. But I know, I will come apart big time if I dont.   Its painful.   Its painful, because i know that I still love her. And somehow, my notion of love demands that I free her.   I think it is quite obvious why I decided to write again. Maybe I need this as part of my medication.

      there are two things that are making my smile... spiderman at 7:30p and the trip to jabonga, agusan del norte right after.  first, spiderman.  been looking forward to this number for 2 months already.  looking forward to how MJ would look, and of course how the saga would continue.  i nearly missed this "premiere" because i was anticipating area work today.  but the universe connived and i would be marching to the movies today with ninin, and be the first ones who would be seeing the webcrawler.    ah yes, the "premiere" is still very much davao.  not exactly the same caliber as manila, but hey at least the seats are reserved and it only costs us PhP70 each for a good seat. hahaha, only in davao.  then there is jabonga.  last time i was there was 12 months back.  quite a long time already.  i am excited to do the travel again.  it surely would be nice being lulled to sleep by snores of fellow passengers inside bachelor. also looking forward to reflections of myself on the window and if my mind allows, reflections on life itself.    i remember wilson, he told me one time how he used to compile a bunch of reflections on philosophy that he collectively calls: mga salimsim sa loob ng bachelor express.    more than that, i look forward to renewing my energy with this chance to meet up with people i have committed to serve.  service still rings loudly in my system and would surely be the basis of my decisions especially here in mindanao.  no matter how corny it may sound, i would like to think that i am still doing my brand of service in the stuff that i write for area managers and coalition builders.  i hope it translates concretely.  excited already, i need to don my costume now and swing...

      sappy... that is how i see it, reading yesterday's blog.  it sounded like a wail or a moan on this beautiful wednesday morning.  i can almost feel my eyebrows meeting at the middle, while asking myself..."where did this shit come from?"  funny how one's pain could move from the  flavor of the day  to yesterday's sappy crap.  how the thing that has burdened and stretched my back could be the one i just flushed in the toilet this morning.  or could it be?  i know that i have unwittingly carried a lot of unneccessary baggage in the last past few months, to wit:  1. my work that has turned into a claustrophobic space where i can not spread my wings, 2. a past relationship that rears its ugly head time and time and again, 3. issues on being alone, living alone and hopefully not leaving alone.  good thing about writing stuff down through a list is that it becomes easier to match them with corresponding turn-arounders.  do i just love the way it grooves.  i got a chance to read through my june entries, and i have written somewhere that most things boil down to one thing... and that is "choice."    1. the choice to play the bitter employee who cannot seem to do his job well, or to be the sharp and cool team leader who wants to do the job great while having lots of fun. 2. the choice to stay in the shadows of a lost relationship, where hope is just another name for cigarettes, or to move on and open up to possibilities of staying happily single or to find a more meaningful love. 3. the choice to take on life alone blindly to sheild the ego from hurt, or to share it with people who matter, knowing that they have the capability to hurting the self more.  my choices seem clear, at least for me... (that is why they are my choices).  and i pretty know what choices to make.    at the end of the day, that is what i would be accounted for.  and being accountable and responsible is one of the things that i take pride in.  and that is liberating.

       been trying to write since this morning... and this is my third try to articulate what my mind has been busy thinking about.   ... maybe it started with friendster.  found out that someone is already in a relationship already.  damn.    what can i do?  it is inevitable that this should transpire.  i mean i was the one who let go, right?  tama si  urlLink angie , "hindi naman nya talaga maiiwasan na maging sya..."  that is so freaking right, and i also cannot help myself to be the person that i am.  damn! i have often prayed that this would never come, when i would have to be the one who will be bearing the pain of leaving.  and here it is, looking at me straight in the eye.    it pains me because i now that this will come, and i thought that i was ready for it.  but no preparation ever was possible for this.  i guess i just need to get through this... let the darkness envelope me and let it destroy my defenses.    my emotions have gotten the better of me... even i don't understand what i have written.  probably even harder for other people to understand it...   o well...

      woke up saturday morning in a rush.  we were supposed to meet up at 6:30 am with nong maeng at nccc mall.  and i freaking woke up at 6:30 am.  pre-gimik stress that's what i call it.  rhea, orland, beth, divine, agnes and me are off to maramag, bukidnon to attend jon-jon's birthday bash.  jon-jon is nong roning's first born, 9 years old and running,  the kid has simply grown.  we would eat lechon and take a dip probably at the edlimar resort thereafter.    as we emerged from a foggy traverse of buda, and the tempretature got warmer, images of places and people seem to widen my lips to a grin.  two years ago this has been my playground.  the terminal didn't change much.  pugo is still being sold at 10 pesos per bunch of five.  nowhere else have i seen pugo trade so vibrant.  the town site is still slow, with the bustle of energy concentrated in the market place.  smiling vendors still line the streets.  riding towards the north, we passed by my old boarding house.  my first home away from home.  it looks pretty  much the same.  my door in the second floor veranda still looks like the prime spot of the the lomod compound.    my room was simple, just a bed, a mosquito net (moskit), a table that double as a cabinet for my clothes, and a monoblock chair. that is all to it.  its best feature was its veranda that opens out to the national highway.  it has become the favorite tambayan of the boarders.  songs of life were sung there with the kid from next door.  and of course tapis girl...  tapis girl ( damn, i forgot her name already ) was a teacher then, charming and sexy.  we talked a lot about her being a new teacher and me being a new student of life.  i heard her stories of wanting to pass the LET, and her disappointments of not doing so.  on occassions, she cared to hear about my day in kadingilan or in pangantucan, talking with farmers and coop leaders.  only thing is she has a thing for air supply, which i think is quite mushy for me.  last time i saw her was on the christmas party of the boarders with tatay lomod.  somehow i just know that she and i can be quite close... still no words were spoken.    many things, amusing and memorable things transpired during my stay there.  the generosity of the people and the lomod clan were quite overwhelming.  the place was a living proof of how one can grow, though quite momentarily and see different aspects of life, or hear about the stories and dreams of people who have walked the earth with me.    hmmm... maramag. ;j

      Yeah!  third time i went to the area this month.  was in brgy. mabantao, kapalong, davao del norte to facilitate with rhea and emma a participatory poverty assessment workshop.  went out of the house before 6am, and checked back in around 9p. whew was tiring but definitely worth it.  on our way home, we rode a motorela to maniki and while singing galileo and ghost on end, thoughts formed in my mind.  and before i forget them, here are a few things to remember when doing area work.   dont bear that grin  especially when riding a habal habal or at the top load.  sometimes, i really could not prevent myself smiling, because of the lush of green that meets the blue of the sky, and the magic of colors that abound.  truly amazing emotions contained in sight.  but after the ride, i would feel as if a whole year's worth of tartar got stuck on my teeth.  hmmmm, not exactly comfortable if i have to talk at my meeting.   prepare  for the area activity.  it is not always i have the opportunity to go to the area to attend meetings or do trainings.  but the thing is, whatever the reason, i would have to maximize the visit and bring as much agenda as i can.   listen  to the people and what they have to say.  i always put it in mind, that the stuff that i am doing, while it boosts my ego is not really about me.  it is working with the interests of people that is why i am there, not really to save them but to give them what is due theirs.  and maybe, just maybe the best help i could give them is to listen to their stories.  no matter how important or trivial, how sad or how happy they may sound.   save energy for the trip back home  because the trip back is sometimes the most dramatic.  it would usually in the late afternoon.  and as the sun sets in the horizon, my heart swells with the beauty around me.     keep eyes open  literally and figuratively.  the countryside has so much to offer.  it presents itself in hues and feelings that would be a pity to miss it.  though at times the lulls of napping makes my eyes heavy, so i miss the beauty unfolding around.  okay lang yun, no one's gonna take me away form my zzzzzz.   look at people in the eye  peer into their souls, and let them in yours.  that is how i cherish every moment with the community. that way they are individualized and treated as a person.  and i avoid the thought of treating them as a mere statistic and makes my work more alive.   share the story  when we talk about our personal "it"s with other people, it puts more value to it.  the  urlLink fish philosophy  we have embraced at the beginning of the year, necessitates the telling of our story with other people.  that is the amazing thing about sharing, it is a two way thing, the more i give, the more i seem to receive.    quite a list already.  but i'll stop now, i'll probably let these stuff digest first and get on to writing more of it, as i move.

      did tons of work today.  the visual aids for the participatory poverty assessment that i would be conducting tomorrow almost took my whole day.  then there was the strategizing with beth for tomorrow's priorities.  there was also the preparation of needed logistical materials.  whew, full day today.  but on a wednesday, when all my energy would have run out already, surprise of all surprise... i seem to have tons of it. even if the stuff that i need to do has not thinned a bit (but has continued to get thicker and thicker by the minute).  i am glad because i seem to have come out of my "depression," if that is the term for it.   my blogs past couple of days seem to speak it out with the tones of not knowing what to do.  of the messages hidden in half-angst, half-harrowing tones of sadness and to some extent bitterness.  but like magic i bounced out of it... funny, it was also like magic that i was trapped in it for some time.  i knew i had renewed energy when i went down this afternoon to get a drink of water, i found gaga fixing herself a cup of coffee.  she told me how sleepy she was and how heavy her feeling this afternoon.  and the reflection in her eye formed my face with a wide grin and eyes starting to find its sparkle again.  i wasn't even sleepy then.  not a bit of drowsiness.  i feel renewed and energized... and its already the end of the day!!!  i just hope this goes on till the end of the week...  ... maybe its the vitamin c (i took 1 tablet in the morning and another during lunch) ... or the genes... ... or it could be the milk...  ...hehehe kumokorni na uli ako ;j

      June 21, 2004 was a long day.    i started early, but was surprised to find  urlLink rhea  earlier.  was i glad to start monday with her early. i just hoped and prayed that she could continue this streak throughout the week...  then off to more business for me, writing, writing, talking, and still more writing.  facilitating, then more writing, and more writing again.  texting and yes more writing.  but that did not make my day long?    maybe my long day came from a lot of thoughts just before i entered sleep.  i was playing with my mind and realized three phases where i am in.  these are:  * waiting - for a sudden flash of inspiration perhaps, for someone perhaps, for 6p perhaps, for the weekend perhaps?  but it surely has taken forever for that one to come.  but the thing is, i am longing for something to happen, but don't know what exactly it is.  i remember Toh Lark, my boss in my thomson days.  he would always say "patience is not one of my virtues," whenever he is made to wait.  and must i say i am almost there to blurt out those famous lines.  * changing - change seems to happen so fast these days.  i was telling ninin how pre-JVP and during JVP was different with post-JVP.  it was how change has come so fast.  before it was always a refresh to have to change.  it was quite easy, because change happens at a very slow pace, sometimes, i even invite change.  but things "changed" more than a year after year-end.  change is happening so fast, i cannot seem to keep track of it.  most of the time it has become an unwelcomed one, like breaking up (from a relationship) or moving out (from the jvp house), or stepping forward (in the office in her absence), and a lot of other instances where i move.    * keeping - keeping up, or keeping things.  i feel that i am still desperately holding on to something, or someone.    three words that end in "-ing."  three ideas that seems to contradict with each other.  three phases that are in a blender of sorts, interacting with each other, pulling away from each other, creating chaos within.  i woke up kinda late today, trying to articulate my thoughts.  somehow it doesn't make sense.  but what else is new?  that is why i am the complicated person that i am.

      meeting someone the first time is not quite my idea of an adventure.  but heck, i just found myself saturday night, dressed in my shorts, TWO sandals, and white shirt, with only 300 pesos in one pocket and yosi on the other.  with my cellphone in tow and belly carrying san mig light plus a mentality of "what am i going to loose?" i went out and met her.  i don't know what came over me.  perhaps it is just the notion that i am feeling alone these days, that any chance to have a certain connection with another person is a good thing as any other.  though i have my friends (which i am thankful that they are always around), i cannot help the feeling of isolation.    this feeling of alienation has been nagging me.  it has constantly created a void of difference between people that i have come to care about.  it has fashioned for itself a bubble around this silly person that i am.    needless to say, after downing two more bottles of red horse, our meeting was over, with no other prospects of a repeat.  sure, she was quite interesting, but somehow, the connection that i long to corner simply isn't there.    i complain of being alone, but i have no initiative to open up with people.  damn, sometimes i hate myself for not being able to know what i really want.    and so i start this week, another trip to knowing.  looking forward to one of questions and answers that somehow doesn't fit.  but i also look forward to being able to sense through this all.  somehow, it might be easier to close my eyes and let my feelings point to where i should go.

      i have tons to do today.  reports, reports and more reports.  heck my work life has always been a monologue of writing and writing.  there is a report for lapp-2, probably a proposal for pef later (which, i do not want to do).  and it has become difficult for me to put down into words all those stuff about work, especially in the last couple of days.  however, yesterday rhea, beth and I went to Carmen, Davao del Norte to attend one of our business opportunities workshop.  it was the usual community process of a speaker talking about possible enterprises that the community can take on.  probably also just the usual farmer participants that you would see who are hopeful to get something out of the activity.  it could have been easy to reduce everything to the usual.  however, when i looked one of the participants straight in her eye.  i knew something struck a chord which i know so very well.    she probably is in her late 50's, her hair is almost white already, her back bent probably by the years of making a living, without actually living.  i reached for her hand to shake it, and felt it leathery with the subtle touch of a mother.  and her eyes were brown, that narrowed to an almost slit to focus at my face.  and that's when it happened.   i remembered the joys of being one with the people, of being able to connect with the people who i have committed to serve.  the farmers and the fisherfolks that triggered a real desire to stay in mindanao and help out, in my own little way.  suddenly, all this bullshit about community economic development started to make sense again.  suddenly, i remembered that the lapp-2 report, albeit indirectly, would be helping out the people in maragusan have a more transparent budget process allocation and spending, thereby creating more opportunities for businesses through the government spending that would be pouring in the projects that are actually needed by the people as articulated by them (pant...pant...pant... that was one long sentence).  suddenly, the reports embodied persons, they have ceased to be just the meaningless words that they have devolved into.  the words have become the hands of the men and women of rural mindanao.  suddenly, i remembered my first motivation to stay on in aadc. that is to give back the blessings what has been given freely right from the start.  the printing on our batch shirt of St.Francis, LSQC paraded in my mind once again... "to whom much is given, much is also expected..." it goes.  it was colored maroon, the color that i will wear in the next four years of my college life.    so before i write too much on my blog, i stop, because work awaits... yes even on a friday.

      Your Brain Usage Profile:  Auditory : 58% Visual : 41% Left : 35% Right : 64%  jerry, you show a slight right-hemisphere dominance with a moderate preference for auditory processing, an unusual and somewhat paradoxical combination of characteristics.   You are drawn to a random and sometimes nonchalant synthesis of material. You learn as it seems important to a specific situation, and might even develop a resentment of others who attempt to direct your learning down a specific channel.   Your right-hemispheric dominance provides a structure that is only loosely organized and one which processes entire swatches of reality, overlooking details. You are emotional in your reactions and perceptual more than logical in your approach, although you can impose structure and a language base when necessary.   Your auditory preference, on the other hand, implies that you process information sequentially and unidimensionally. This combination of right-brain and auditory modes creates conflict, as you want to process data more rapidly than your natural processes allow.   Your tendency to be creative and free-flowing is accompanied by sufficient ability to organize and be logical, allowing you a reasonable degree of success in a number of different endeavors. You take in information methodically and systematically which can then be synthesized rapidly. In this manner, you manage to function consistently well, although certainly less efficiently than you desire.   You prefer the abstract and are a theoretician at heart while retaining the ability to be practical. You find the symbolism in a great deal of what you encounter and are something of a "mystic."   With regards to your lifestyle, you have the mentality which would be good as a philosopher, writer, journalist, or instructor, or possibly as a systems designer or  social worker . Perhaps most important is your ability to  "listen to your inner voice"  as a mode of skipping over unnecessary steps to achieve your goals.

      been trying to write in the past two days.  but somehow the words have failed me.  i did try to open blogger's "create a new post page" everyday, but the keyboard wouldnt click, the fingers wouldnt move.  i am stuck.  i have just awoken from a very long night, with little sleep.  i was talking to dax and ninin (3/4 of the davao boys... namiss namin bigla si mike), and just basically updating each other of the craziness of this world we are living in.    dax and i had a few bottles of beer. when ninin joined us, we went to our not so favorite coffee shop in davao, blugre and just did a caffeine shot with a serving of chocolate sylvanas.   coffee was normal, but the sylvanas are worth a second serving... yummm   transition.  that was one of the topics we were engaged in.  transition, is somewhere in between the spectrum of here to there.  somewhere, or somehow it is an unknown of sorts.  and the best (or worst) thing about it, is that no one will ever know for sure if they are walking (or running, or dilly-dallying, or... shit whatever, maybe just "passing through') in it in themselves, until they are told so.  it is a necessary evil, when one explores outside the comfort zone.  it is a tunnel, yes a dark tunnel at that, where the only source of light can be just a tight squinch of the eye, or a dot of white on a canvass of blank.  two years hence, we three began questioning our own respective transitions.  dax and ninin's have their own issues, but my demon is a friend of mine.  she is a friend, personally, but when it comes to work we are, to put it nicely... civil.  but i'd rather not talk about her yet.  and i felt a little bit lost when i realized that the unknown in my transition has created a maze of passageways that seems to be leading everywhere... but here.  it has been prodding me to move, but it is not telling me where.  as i face the paths that lay before me, my stomach turns because the choices are all attractive yet so devious.    the easiest thing is to take the position of the "non-choice."  the temptation to just stare at the options and not to pick one, hoping that the forces of the universe would just tip you towards one side, thereby "making" the decision for you.  but how can i move on with the transition if i would not choose?    (if only i can come up with a term for a question that needs no answer, that is how i would call this statement.)  but the transition in all its twists and turns, can be a place of rest too.  while it gives a feeling of being lost, it embraces the tired soul and prepares it for the next segment of the journey.    i feel that i am nearing the end of this transition.  i will give it six months the max... and then i would be off to my next journey.  the signs are being set up,  paths are slowly appearing and the north wind is blowing again.  it is whispering softly in my ear and giving me the shivers each time it comes.    in the next six months, it is beckoning me to either build or destroy, to create or to obliterate.  but most of all it is renewing its call for me to be true.  to be the "lost boy" that i am, the wanderer that i have become, and the searcher that i could be.  and so i am off, in the greatest transition of all... life.

      i am surprised.  at a sunday, five in the afternoon, and i am not yet in my ranting mood?  i choose to look at my blessings today.  i am blessed because i am in the greatest adventure of my life.  i am on a quest!  eventhough, it has turned to a heavy quest (who says quests can be taken in stride...), i have been able to smile just before i sleep.  and the gift of that smile, makes all the troubles, trials and difficulties of the day lift slowly off my shoulders as i drift into sleep.  i am blessed with a simple life.  i do not need much, i can go on a little.  and i can really enjoy leisure.  life seems to be unaffected my complications and complexities.  it is as simple as it is, maybe it is just my weird brain thinking about lots of stuff.    i am blessed with a companionship of good friends... let me qualify, good female friends.  ladies are worthy companions in friendship, they offer a lot of insights, they are very wise.  i can generalize, but i'd rather not... let us just say that they are special in their own way.  i don't know why it was told time and again (especially in "harry met sally") that men and women cannot be friends.  i have let go of the resentment (alright i admit, there was a little bit in that previous blog) why i do not have enough male bonding.  and i dont need to be drunk and cursing all the time to have a good time with them.  i am blessed because i have a date later... and i'll probably leave it at that. in the meantime, off i go...

Apo .    especially on a day like this.  when i moved to my new private space, one thought that continued to haunt me is, "would i still see Apo in the morning?"  after a few days, i realized that the street actually shows a snapshot of its foothills... wow a new facet, which i have not seen before.  see aside from being a fan of mountains in general and  urlLink climbing its slopes (via Kapatagan)  in specific, my fascination and attachment with the country's king of mountains is cemented by a bond. a deep relationship, rarely spoken of, but always felt.  apo has been my symbol of freedom.  well, mountaineering could be a symbol of such.  but i attach my definition of freedom with respect and deep personal experience.    in the last two years or so that i have been a davaoeño, the image of the mountain has almost always completed my mornings.  it may appear as one massive piece of wonder, so imposing in the horizon.  other times, its soft corves outline the sky with a unique mixture of midnight blue against the gray morning sky.  or it would reveal only parts of it structure, just one face that has turned itself from you, or the breathtaking beauty of its boulders amidst sulphur deposits.  sometimes it would be blanketed with a sea of cotton clouds.  at these times i tell myself, that even if i cannot see it, i know that it is there, standing tall, majestic as ever.  it needs no eyes to marvel that it is the grandfather of philippine mountains.    as i search the horizons every morning, i take comfort in feeling that there is someone watching my journey to being.  a connection that has read my emotions, and has understood the complexities that i am.  it stood as a reminder of my quest of personhood, of being the person that i am.  it represents the daily struggle to be faithful and the joy that comes with every discovery.  and i know that i would never be alone in this journey, for i have my apo with me.  near, never far.

      while punch 9 is making it an emphasis that they only play alternative music, i was nourishing an alternative relationship with an old friend.  she was my officemate from thomson.  we were good friends before we were lovers, and after our love relationship, somehow we still found each other to be good friends.    ironic it may seem, but we became more comfortable with each other after our so called romance.  somehow the time that we spent far from each other, made our relationship stronger.  last night we were "remembering" our good times together.  i was chuckling and laughing of how well we remember each other.  doesn't seem like three years already, since we said goodbye.  one of the reasons why i go home to manila is to have a chance to see her.  we would see each other with friends, then i would take her home to her boarding house.  but before calling it a night, we would share hours and hours of stories and yosi.  she would be talking about work, i would be talking about the loves that came and went.  she would be listening to my highs and lows, i would be listening to her breathing beside me or right in front of me.  then i would marvel and look at a good friend whom i have came to know.  it's hard to describe what we have.  like alternative music, it has been hard to put into a category.  but who cares about categories and labels at that?  what we have seems to transcend images of boundaries (of definitions, of geography, of time, perhaps).  but one thing is for sure, she has found a good friend in me... and our relationship, no matter how alternative it may seem would still be one that i would treasure... most.

      since i started writing my mind, the day has been transfixed with situations that invites itself to be put down in words.  it kinda carries me off into a surreal world, free from the pangs of the minute.  as if writing about the everyday creates a treasure chest of memories captured in its sensual form.

      i thought i had a shitty day yesterday.    it started at 3:30am when my phone's alarm blared.  i felt as if a gush of alchohol is clobbering my liver.  though there was no good time the previous night, funny i felt that way.  i took a bath remembering that i have to be in New Bataan, Compostela Valley at 9am later.  "damn," i thought, that is four hours away.  o well, at least its better than an office day.  the morning was cool, but the trip to the terminal was interesting.  curiousity got the better of me, when i hitched a ride on a cab that already has a passenger, but would only charge me, the flag down rate (only, php20 here in davao).  i suspect that she is into the flesh trade, because the driver was talking about  "dapat, humanap ka na ng lalaking hindi manloloko sa iyo... hindi pwede yung pa-isa-isang gabi lang."  interesting, i thought, especially to be in that situation.  my thoughts were further confirmed, when the air smelled of alcohol... all to familiar, how could i miss it?  but i'd rather not dwell into it, i have a full day ahead, and the sun has not yet risen.  after about 15 mins of trying to catch some sleep, the driver woke me up to say that all passengers need to transfer to another bus.  o well, i can still make it without being late, my phone clock registered, 5:15am.  and boy, what a long ride it was, winding through twists and turns.  but one bonus of the ride is seeing the sun breakthrough from the horizon.  god is good!  he really knows how to jump start a weary heart.  well, the most shitty thing about today was i have to substitute for a speaker whose topic i have never heard of.  at least there is technology of the video cam to help me in the presentation.  at first i rejected the idea... its not my job i thought... why would i bother speaking for him, i don't like him anyway.    but these thoughts withered away as i saw the farmers waiting for me.  they were the leaders of New Bataan.  but somehow in their eyes, there is an unmistakable glimmer of hope amidst the hopelessness of poverty.  these people are ready to work together, to get them selves out of the shit hole of poverty.  their rugged hands, and the burnt color of their skin, spoke of passion to get things done, to take home enough food for their family.  it represents the dreams of sending their kids to school, and of a better life.  i enjoyed the short encounter, and i affirmed that i can really speak bisaya quite well already.  i think i am already understandable, i can already see nods emanating from the crowd... if you are a true blue manileño, which i am, your heart will beam with pride for being able to communicate what you have in mind.    i left New Bataan with a light heart, and a skip when i walk.  i seem to look forward to the trip back home, to share this wonderful opportunity to "break bread" with the folks.    so, inspite of missing a disembarkation point, and waking up with my mouth wide open, the aircon breaking down, just when we were approaching the Sasa traffic area, and a kid shouting and making a fool out of himself (just for adults around him know that he is in the brink of taking a crap already... but later the crap came and the aroma of child shit, filled the now, dead aircon bus) i know that i had a wonderful day.  i also did not mind the downpour just as i was getting down from the bus and walking home at least 4 blocks from my laundry area.  and to top it all of, an old friend texted and to know later on that she had two miscarriages already.  it broke my heart, even if i cannot be in her situation.  sometimes, you feel with the other person, even those messages conveyed through texts.  last night, after a nice meal at mandarin in SM, i checked the time, it registered 9:30pm.  it was a long day, but i prayed and gave thanks to God for a wonderful day i had.  it was wonderful because it has been so full of colors, of tastes, of sounds, of feelings and emotions, and not to mention smells that have warmed the heart, and readied the spirit to more challenges of service, spirituality, simplicity, solidarity and social justice.  so apart from the kid in the bus, yesterday wasn't so shitty after all.

      i felt naked in front of everyone.  seems like ipe and cyn are having a hay day stripping me of my defenses.  no use fighting them off... they really know how to do that to me.  but somehow it helped me a lot, because it points to one of my basic needs as of now.  since i cannot draw in from my leadership potential, i have to get it from someone else.    if i also knew them well, they would not give me this.  my guess is that ipe would continue to push me to the wall and not help me out.  well that is only my guess.  in that case, i have two choices then: to get the most of it or to reject it all together.  i wish to take the first one, to make the most of it.  for i have given myself until the end of the year for AADC.  my resolve seems to get stronger and stronger everyday.  it has become a snowball that is dangerously gaining size and momentum.    but i still wish to get the most out from it.  while i look forward to more crisis ahead, i also will be anticipating more learnings with it.  unsettling, that's the way it will go until december.

      so much for the weekend.  am at the office... chatting with didi, bebot and mader.  cant wait for tomorrow i guess.  o well, AADC has truly been an organization who has really been passionate about work.  that is a blessing, and until recently has been a bane for us, i think.  blessing, first and foremost because somehow i still believe in the cause of the organization.  and it really is something that will help the communities we are serving.  i still believe that proper attention to economics, coupled with our ongoing initiatives to dialogue constantly and participate in governance would help not only inch development but enable it to hopefully grow leaps and bounds.    but this tireless pursuit for exellence has somehow affected me, sadly more negative than positive.  because, i have grown tired over the months, i have stayed here.  it seems that the organization is constantly on the receiving end.  while much experience and expertise have been gained, but no or little regard for the little things that makes a friendly atmosphere.  what has happened to our fish philosophy.  all we have known is work, work, work and more work.  where is the friendship that should also be developing.    at least with rhea and orland, we have created a bond that goes beyond work.  but with other people in the office, i somehow think that we are just here to work.  and they expect no less than that from us.  its difficult to be in that situation .  i still subscribe that for me to do my job well, i must be in friendship with people that i work with.  sadly, some people would rather work than develop such.  tomorrow, we would be talking with her.  i just hope we set things in their proper places.  i am not looking forward to it, it may even stir the temporary calm.    but i guess, that is just the way it goes.  lets do some unsettling at the office tomorrow

      i am no war freak guy.  i even try to avoid conflict as much as possible.    however.  see i have this office mate who for some strange reason stopped talking to me directly. she would nag and yell to my team mates but never at me.  she would give her instructions for me through orland, but never to me.  at first i thought that this is just one of those menopausal bursts in her.  but no, she was all this last week, even for the most of this week.    cold shoulder, that's what i am getting. so i thought to myself, if she doesn't want to talk to me, then it would be a pleasure not to talk with her to.  after all, who needs a crumpled face in the morning.  who needs a person who only wants to do her job, and imposes that everybody do theirs in the same structure as she sees it.  then the bubble burst. we had a session with cyn and came face to face with the following realizations:  1. what she was doing is a personal attack on me.  i am a 3 in the enneagram.  and people of my personality type always wants to have a good image.  bad image means a shattered personality, that's how normal 3's like me see stuff.  but then again, we also know that in order to move towards a healthy 3, we must go beyond this image thing and just project who really are... but then again this is another entry.  2. she is a projection of the mad woman of our lives.  for me she was like my mom.  the nagger, and the one who always wants to get her own way. the authority who is always right, who knows it all.  that was she.  i get away from this type of person by putting her in my ignore mode.  just let her be, don't listen to her non-sense.  just look at her and close the senses.    3. however, this mad woman is not my mom.  she is a co-worker.  and thus, she deserves the respect and the mentoring that is due all co-workers.    4. thus, she must be dealt with by the team, because the damage she did was with the team.  and no matter how pride swallowing it would be.  she must be dealt with according to the tenets of good relationships.  as of now, i am still on the offensive stance, but cyn is right, we would have to speak with her.  not considering her age, but considering her value as a person.    i know this is not going to be easy.  it would be a test of being true to oneself and to the “it” AADC has been talking about since the start of the year.  and as much as i want to avoid this conflict, we should meet it head on and let it rear its ugly face.  for only in real honesty can it be pacified, hopefully put in its rightful place...   that would be something to look forward to on monday.  our strategy has already been laid down over halo-halo and siomai yesterday, today, we consolidate our ranks, and get ready to meet our demons.

      i would have expected that most people who watched harry potter last night would have written about it.  i would have expected that i would be writing about it too today.  but i do not feel like writing too much about it, especially today with a bit of hangover.    dont get me wrong though, i liked the way it was made and i am still a big fan.  what with the cinematic genius of cuaron, and the greatly improved acting skills of radcliffe, grint and emma watson, it truly is one of the good movies i've watched recently.  i would rather talk about... i do not know how can i put it right... male bonding.  the past few weeks were really a transition for me.  along with the transition is the introspection of sorts.  and one of those observations that popped up was, i have no male friends here in davao.  for the past two years, i have been blessed with the company of women almost entirely.  again dont get me wrong, women are good friends. i have had the opportunity of being in friendship with the best and the worst of them.  i guess it has always been mother's instinct for them to take care of people. even the most calloused of them always have a soft spot for this.  i have greatly marvelled of their ability to be such.  they have a way of prying open the coldest of hearts and the most clenched fists.  i stand in awe how some of them have made my heart skip a beat, and how some have broken my spirits.  however, i kinda missed the "distance" that male companionship brings.  i missed my brothers.  i missed our non-personal way of going out.  i missed my drinking buddies, the distance brought together by bottles of beer, yosi, cursing and everything else in between.  i missed talking about cars, loud music, obnoxious and chauvanist stuff.  i missed grooving and sharing the pain of living through silence.  i missed insensitivity.    i missed doing the bad finger and bad mouthing. slamming, fighting over a girl, immaturity and all the other things that make up our xy chromosome.  in short, i missed being an ass hole.    hahaha, i never thought i would write that.  but boys will really be boys.  and the want to be bad comes once in a while.  and today has just been one of them.    relationships are expressions of a human being's need to be connected.  it resides in every strand of being a person. and this is probably my way of telling me that my moving out is also calling me to open up new relationships with other people, while treasuring the ones that i already have.   tang ina ang drama nung huli!   post script:  sorry, i just can't resist sharing that hermione's boobs gets bigger when they are outside hogwarts, but deflates while indoors... heheheh

      at 11:30pm last night, i laid down on the bed.  i am tired of carrying my stuff around.  now they are all around me, turned into a battlefield of sorts.  but at least i have finnally closed book four of the goblet of fire, of harry potter's fame.  my first hours of independence was spent reading a book.  hehehe, i was pleased with myself.  not having to do what should be done.  instead i indulged on the thing that i want to do.  i know that i should have bought a cabinet and an electric fan already.  but know, i chose to sit down and turn the pages of the 700 or so pages.    choices.  that is where all of these began.  the goblet of fire choose Harry to be an addendum to the three school champions. He also chose to stand by it and take on its consequences, even if the choice were not his in the first place.  thus, i chose, to live away from the company of tatit, ninin and mehane.  knowing fully well that while it would give me more elbow room, it would have also created distances between friends.  though, it would have been lovelier and more convenient to stay with the ladies.  but the challenge of being able to stand by myself, for myself and with myself seems a very strong call indeed.  this chance is something that i am not letting go.    admittedly, it was a tough choice.  i mean it could have been easier if the alternatives are good-evil kind.  it was more of the good-good thing.  at the point i made the decision, i wasnt even sure which one is better.  but i know i have to take a road, i know i have to take another twist.  and the fork that i took seems comfortable.  i feel that it is the thing that i need, but maybe less of a want.  i woke up this morning with a little skip in my chest.  i was surprised of my new ceiling, walls, even the way my back touched my bed.  and when i sprang out of it, i know that my life will never be the same again.   i have made a choice and i am sticking by it.  ------------  p.s. funny that i chose to move out on the month of our country's independence.  coincidence?  ... naaaahhh choice.

      one of my favorite waking up songs.&nbsp; with less than 24 hours to go before we kick off what we have been working for in the last month, a three day bonanza of people, interaction and lots of "more giving,"&nbsp; my back already aches, i cannot seem to wake up anymore from my phone alarm.  last night i felt that i was gasping for breath, even if i did no physical exertion at all.&nbsp;  ganun pala ang pakiramdam ng hingalin kahit walang galaw ng katawan? &nbsp;   today, i would be working on pure adrenalin and the memories of the song...&nbsp; c'mon jerry, FOCUS, FOCUS

       its always nice, when people come down and visit.&nbsp; in the past two days, it was an old friend, elaine,&nbsp;from my MA years that came over to davao for a business trip (and not to mention, some catching up in between).&nbsp;   nice to hear stories of manila, how old friends have basically been old friends, how some of the troop and the guys had newer stories to share, as if all these months away from home were capsulized and captured over a cup of coffee.   even nicer to tell my story.&nbsp; the story of a wanderer,&nbsp; a seeker, who ironically doesn't know what he is looking for.&nbsp; someone, who goes by instinct or by "smell", or with the north wind.&nbsp; though, it seems that the direction is still cloudy, i feel comfort in the search, in the wait for the discovery.   nice to hug and feel the presence of a colleague, and fellow traveller who has somehow chose a different route.&nbsp; but no matter, the journey of our lives would definitely be intertwined in more ways than one.&nbsp;   though it has been busy past two days, and my best has been pushed and extended beyond what i know.&nbsp; it was a highlight to have coffee with her last thursday, and breakfast this morning, and durian for lunch.&nbsp; not exactly a perfect diet, but hey, the ritual of durian is best celebrated with someone who shares the passion.   this morning, i saw an old bead ornament that marlon gave as a present at the end of my jvp year.&nbsp; somehow, i have attached a special meaning for a bracelet or a choker made of beads.&nbsp; with its intricate designs and computed combination of colors, it has come to symbolize the journey of my years.&nbsp;   so i put them on again, to say, "hey dude, this guy is on his journey, and he knows it!"

       whenever i pass by the intersection of sandawa and quimpo boulevard, going towards the davao city overland transport terminal, i never miss the large advertising sign of marlboro.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  "freedom is calling" so it goes, looming above the place that has come to be my portal to different parts of mindanao.&nbsp; it just occurred to me how, powerful the message of the advertisement is.&nbsp; especially in the place where it casts its shadow.  &nbsp;  whether the ad is for me or not, i resound to the truth that the message of the ad conveys.&nbsp; that freedom calls everytime, not only when i pass by that road.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  and not to over-academize it, freedom is simply being true.&nbsp; true to what is in my heart.&nbsp; true to my desires, true with my destiny.  &nbsp;  now the only problem there is to really know what is it really that my heart desires, what is my destiny?  &nbsp;  today, i say my version of my heart's desire and my destiny is to take root in  mindanao .&nbsp; hahaha, i never thought that it would be that simple, or complicated, looking at another side.&nbsp; maybe its because i really do tend to simplify/complicate things.&nbsp; but yeah, really that is how i see myself, and that is my freedom to be able to take root right here, right now.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  that last paragaraph surely sent a chill down my spine.&nbsp; it is rare for me to speak boldly of my future.&nbsp; maybe later i would look back at this blog, and smile or frown because of what i would be then.  &nbsp;  but now, i guess i'll never know.&nbsp; so i'll just get back to work.

       been working hard, in the last 18 days.&nbsp; i figured that i need some saturday night delight.&nbsp; so after dinner at golden brown around the gs area, emma, gaga and myself trooped towards the corner of rizal and anda to sample early harvests of durian.  &nbsp;  damn, i know that we are near as soon as the pungy smell permeated the air.&nbsp; it got my blood circulating a little bit faster in anticipation to the treat that awaits us.&nbsp; and there we found mang karding, according to a loyal clientele, the man knows if a fruit is delicious just by&nbsp;looking at it and feeling it. hmmm must be some talent, i for one had to smell each and every fruit and somehow try to "communicate" with it.  &nbsp;  anyhows, i chose a 1.4 kilo native durian, quite cheap at php84 as i said, it is still quite early in the season.&nbsp; of course it is the native variety, as the chanee is a little bit tame for me.  &nbsp;  as i sat down with the opened up fruit, i inhaled deeply the aroma of the king of all fruits.&nbsp; i know that this is gonna be good!&nbsp; and with the first touch of the flesh to my lips, i knew that kadayawan season is approaching very near.&nbsp; the smell is arrogantly teasing my palate inviting me to devour its meat.&nbsp; i closed my eyes as i bit more and more to the seed.&nbsp; images of paradise and stars came out of nowhere from the darkness under my eyelids.  &nbsp;  as i swallowed the first batch, my heart skipped a beat and my lungs drew in more air to savor the experience.&nbsp; my vision is becoming blurry and my head started to float, i am drunk in every sense of the word for the moment of letting go of everything that i hold dear for this one moment encounter with my favorite fruit.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  and before i knew it, no more, the 1.4kilo joy has emptied itself into our stomachs.&nbsp; as we grinned the way only people who have eaten durian grinned, i know that the next few days of trooping to durian stations would be full of happy memories.  &nbsp;   burp....  damn that still smells like durian.  -----------------

      we have been talking to kublai a lot these days.  he is the one who is tasked of encapsulating our 10th year anniversary celebrations and 7th GA ideas into a work of art.    after one of those visits, i put together some insights on being an artist:  1.  artists have no need to explain themselves.  i remember mike in this, we were always proud to say that we are artists especially when ninin asks us the reason why we are doing stuff.  in kublai's case, i observed that he becomes irritated on the "whys" of his work.  he just knows how to express, he leaves the rationalization to critics.  at times, i wonder why i analyze too much.  when in fact there is only the moment to live for.  pregnant with possibilities and impossibilities that makes life worth living.  2.  inspiration is fanned by emotion.  i do not understand the mood swings of an artist, most especially when they complain that they cannot move on with their art.  a brick wall, an expanse of ocean, a thick foliage of forests seems to block an artists hand into creating.  and as soon as they reach this, they would go back to what they are feeling, to their core.  that is why, they would need to feel happier or sadder (and the emotions in between) in order to finish up a work.  emotions can hold so much power.  that is probably why masters of their emotions are the ones who respect it the most.    3.  art is creation.  and like their products, artists too are borne out of different processes.  kublai's art is about his journey towards the "better."  the guy knows he is good, because he knows that he was not as good as before.    and like every talent, it grows every time it is used.  i have been amazed of how i can learn new stuff everytime.  it probably is because of the thirst for new learning has always been in my mind.  hahaha, i guess this is what happens when i try to put together the left and right side of my brain.  o well back to work, still lots of stuff to create...

      i've been running around since july kicked in.  now almost the mid-point of july, i feel that i have done so much already, but it seems never enough.  i have written countless pages, thought about the wildest ideas... i have given my best.  but coming into the office today, i feel that it never seems to be enough.  the GA is getting nearer and nearer everyday, 14 days to go.  my dad's birthday is today, and i haven't greeted him yet, as his phone is out of coverage/or probably turned off.  damn, my stress level is going beyond its limits.  then as i sat down to do this entry, i remembered fr. soc's homily in one of the masses i attended.  i think it was the send-off mass before the youth camp in 97.  i remembered him talking about meaning, about "kahulugan."  he said that the word kahulugan holds such a deep meaning in tagalog.  its image is something like that of a farmer planting the seeds that would bear his harvest after 4 months. he bores a hole on the ground, and patiently puts a seed into it and covers the hole.   "ang bawat butas ay "HUHULUGAN" niya ng isang binhi, dahil sa paglilibing nito ay magkakaroon ito ng kaganapan."   though the seed would not know that it would grow into a plant, while it is still a seed.  it lets the farmer bury it, for it to die and grow into a plant.  although the story still does not explain my meaning, my "kahulugan."  i just know that i am a seed being buried,  hinu-HULOG sa butas ng buhay , and i know that the confusion, the period of the unknown would bring life into me later on.  i may not know it now, but the hand that planted me knows.  and i found a piece of peace in that.

      had a nice dream in the wee hours of sunday morning.  i dreamt that i was smoking outside my room, wearing only my sarong.  then we were supposed to have a new female boarder who was hot and sexy and most of all willing... to be friends.  friendly chick if you ask me.  so she approached me and asked for a stick, for a moment there i thought that, o this is kewl, pick up moment to some extent.  so there we were smoking, and talked a bit.  details of which i cannot remember now.    next thing i know, she was already inviting me to her room, to have a look at something... perhaps.  but as soon as i entered her room, i awoke.  damn, my interest really got the best of me and got back to sleep, hoping to continue the dream.  the dream continued, but i found myself already leaving her room... damn, i missed the juicy parts.  but before i left, i asked for her number.  she was kind enough to give it to me, scribbled it on a piece of paper.  i looked at it when she gave it to me, and found the word (i don't know it was more of a combination of letters : oyiyahoyiah.  i also gave my number to her.  but i quizzingly looked at her with the numbers and the weird word.  she winked and told me the word, she used as a way to remember her number easier...  i awoke instantly again.  this time, i got my fone and texted the number, saying "you may find this weird, but i dreamt about your number... and this will be the last of it, and you wont hear from me again."  and her number, haha go figure.

      we had dinner last night at la toscana... hmmmm pasta zingara and capricciosa pizza.  probably one of the best italian restaurant in davao, with value for money.  am no italian afficionado, but for a gastronomic sample, the food in la toscana was pretty great.  however, what sets the place apart from the likes of pico bello and the other italian place at the venue (forgot the name... hehehe) was the personal extension of service of the people there.  there is only one server, but she seems shy and does her job in the quiet way that we have been accustomed to already.  but it has something to do with the smile, as if she is always glad to have customers inside.  she gives enough attention without the encroaching atmosphere that other servers seem to impose on people.  at least, privacy is precious here.    i remember she was pregnant a few months back, and when she delivered her child, the filipina owner with what looks like an italian fathered kid came over to watch over the place.  really feels like family.  the place never really got full of customers.  there are four 4-seater tables and one 4-6 seater.  small place, quaint and very homely.  conversations were limited from table to table, no ruckus, no great fanfare, just a simple space to enjoy good food and the company of friends.    i always look forward to having dinner there.  good memories in la toscana.  i would like to note also that whenever agnes and i have dinner there, we seem to understand each other very well.  tomato sauce? or mozzarella?  or the black olives?  or the olive oil?  or probably, la toscana is a ground of neutrality for both of us.  whatever it may seem, i am glad there is a place in davao, where we can just sit together, be friends and just listen and talk to each other.  where the stress of doing our jobs well can take the back seat and just lay back and let time pass.  it is the good combination of these factors makes la toscana one of the better places to visit here in davao.  and i would definitely come back again and again.

      ang mga langgam sa dingding sunud-sunuran buong lambing nagmamadali nagmamambilis  alam kaya nila ang pupuntahan? natutuo ba sila ng matematika o agham? mas mahalaga alam ba nila ang pinanggalingan?  sa bawat hakbang maliliit at kaunti lamang nakikipaghalikan  sa kasalubong  inaamoy ang kasama pagkain, o kahit kwento may dala ganyan ang buhay langgam simple  pero ubod ng kumplikado

      My phone buzzed at 5:30am.  I heard it but never made any effort to snooze the alarm.  My mind was awake but my body was still craving the warmth of my bed.  After the 4th alarm (with five minutes interval each), I said that it is time to wake up.  Today is going to be another interesting day, I suppose, what with the first order of the day a one hour trip to Tagum.  I arrived at Tagum around 8:30am.  I was supposed to meet Bebot for a little document turn-over and fast strategizing of stuff that he would be doing in the next few days.  However, the man texted me a little past 7:00am and said that he would be late, around 9:30am it is.  I think that’s fine, a little waiting wouldn’t hurt.  So I sat myself on one of the benches and engaged in one of my favorite past times: people watching.  And there I was looking at the buzz of people around me.  I remembered that the bus terminal is one of the most frequented places for me in my more than 2 years of adventure here in Mindanao. It has been interesting for me to look for the intricacies and the nuances of every bus terminal from that of the others.    And as the seconds turned into minutes, and into an hour, my bottom began to hurt, my stomach began to grumble and my mind started to play.  I bought some white corn from a vendor for PhP10, enough for a quick breakfast.  While eating, I observed the behaviors of the different people around me, and came up with this little list.  (I love making lists these days).  1.	People come and go.  The terminal is always a place where no one actually stays for long.  Every time a bus comes, as passengers vacate their seats, more buns fill them up soon after.  The hustle and bustle of activity is highly evident with the shuffling of the feet of the vendors as they chase every bus window and the avoiding eye of customers, trying to sell anything from bottles of water, softdrinks, to foodstuffs bibingka, eggs, peanuts, siopao, to sunglasses, earrings belts, lighters and towels.  A wild grocery it is, only this time the things for sale are held in the hands of the vendors, not in shelves.  I wondered why the benches are still there in this flurried environment.  And maybe those are for those who wait.  2.	People wait.  The bus terminal is also a place where people wait.  Whether the lingering is about a person or a particular trip, of a particular bus company, of a particular bus, there is always a sense of longing of people in the place.  The noise could never deny the silence of waiting in the eyes of every person.  The vendors wait for the next passenger who would buy their stuff.  A guy in cargo pants sits quietly, neck craning for the next aircon bus that would take him to Davao.  Is he waiting for employment?  Or is he going home?  A couple awaits for the arrival of another bus that could be probably carrying a daughter or a son, or a relative.  But their excitement overflows through their smiles and just could not be contained by the time that separates them from their loved one.  And I looked at my cellphone watch and sat and waited, patiently for Bebot to arrive.  Around 10:00am, hopefully he would be arriving.  3.	People heal.  After almost two hours of waiting, Bebot arrived at 10:30am.  But minutes before he arrived I came upon a scene that is unique for this terminal, this day, this minute.  A bus conductor suddenly rushed to vomit.  His companions were saying that he has fever already, but still pushed to travel.  (Talk about dancing the limits).  He squatted in front of the bus, his back against the people.  And as his back arched once more to call on another round of “dwarf”, the lady beside me were saying that to anyone who listened that he should not have traveled if he is not feeling good.  While another rushed to him and asked if he is ok.  He didn’t answer but the lady seems convinced that she should help him and so he began to massage his chest and his nape.  Then people crowded the scene, all wanting to help in anyway he or she can.  The events pushed me back and next thing I saw was a blind man massaging the person who has turned pale already.  I do hope he is going to be alright.  When finally, Bebot and I sat down to talk, the slowly drifted away from my observations in the last two hours and concentrated at the task at hand.  We talked some more until our business was finished.  But all this time, people were coming and going, were waiting and healing each other in more ways than one.  A chopsuey of events enfolding for any audience who care to watch.

      how far would i go in search of a thrill?  that was the question on my mind as i boarded the bus to cagayan.  my destination is jabonga, agusan del norte, its jump-off being butuan.    i arrived at the terminal around 11:15pm.  "no bus to butuan till 1am?  just missed the 11:00pm ride!"  those were the circumstances before the journey.  i hate waiting, so instead of riding the yellow bus (bachelor, going directly to butuan), i rode the red one (rural, going directly to cagayan de oro).  i slept most of the way to cagayan... twas a pleasant ride, seats are luxurious, but somehow sleep wouldnt visit my tired body.  i was awake in most of the 6 hour ride.  i even marvelled at the almost full moon at the stop-over in quezon, bukidnon.    from cagayan to butuan then to jabonga, the scenery, still very majestic, with the sea touching the sky in the horizon.  this route has always been one of my favorites.  if only it has a taste, it could be likened to the new iced tea, earth and sky, being sampled in the malls last weekend.  a bit more tangy than nestea, a little less sweet than lipton.    that leg surely was a tiring one.  i slept at butuan after the women's intertrading meeting in jabonga.  a simple room and a cable tv service which i tuned in to the discovery travel channel.  in the morning, i was awoken by a quote, it goes...  a good traveller has no good plans... ... and no intents on arriving                           lao tzu (philosopher)  i always regarded myself as a traveller of sorts.  i smirked openly because lao tzu, hundreds of years after he mumbled this quote still speaks to my being.    probably it is the itch in my feet, or the newly developed mole in one of my toes, or just the thirst for travel and something new, that has ignited my butt to take the longer yet scenic route to butuan.  before going home finally to davao, i passed by butuan's national museum and had a trip down history.  the last museum, i visited was the one in manila, almost ten years ago.  visitng these sorts of places really has a special place in my heart.  the feeling of reliving the past, imagining the dynamics of time is like looking forward into the future whether predestined or one that would be chosen.  i was tempted to visit the other museum at the site where the balanghays were excavated, but decided against it.  i knew that i would be back, and there is always the next time to look forward to new and more discoveries.  though my body was dead tired, i knew deep inside that i would take this journey again anytime, expecting that it would be unique and as different as the ones before and the ones that will be.  so how far is a thrill?  that would be 888 kilometers of roads, faces and wonders... as the trip last week has been.   some pictures...   urlLink    lake mainit at lunchtime&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    afternoon musings&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    dive... dive... dive&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    looking backward... from fun&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    afternoon nap&nbsp; urlLink

      i awoke with the sound of morning the light of day tells me that i am alive  i am well though my shoulders ache of the loads they carry though my heart heaves of love waiting to be shared  i gaze upon the emptiness of the room and felt joy pushing my lips to a smile  i wonder how moments of the morning can weave its magic to a weary soul as mine  i stand in awe to the independence about me to the leader awakening to friendships blossoming to the new day to great and small things to God  and  i say today is a good day

      i have a new book!!!  ross just sent me the latest book of paulo coelho, 11 minutes.  well its not exactly new, since i've been hearing about the book since last year.  the real come on was how coelho would be providing the words and prose to the a subject as candid yet so real as sex... moreso in how it would figure out when written side by side with love.   i am not so proud as to stoop down and say that i have yet to see how the two would be taken together and make truth what my teachers in san carlos have been emphasizing.  makes me want to just drop everything and read on.   i hope to start reading soon... in the meantime, ites is around.  and much as i want to immerse in my 11 minutes with Maria (the main character in the book), that would have to wait...

          after that mean declaration, here are some things that i want to remember the GA (and the road leading to it)  by:  "you        have to get your acts together, otherwise i wouldn't be surprised that if this happens again, that you would quit..." -- the coach "ang GA ay madugo at masaya..." -- cj "kala ko mahirap na ang alam mong marami kang gagawin, mas mahirap pala kung hindi mo alam ang dapat mong gawin..." -- sillyoldmebeingsillyagen "mabuti pa siguro, mag-resign na lang ako..." -- da man! "...nag-flare up talaga ako..." -- dugong "...ayoko na!!!" -- kj "pagod na pagod ako..." -- daboi "ang ganda ng exhibit niyo..." -- dinky (doo) "wow hitech talaga ng agri-aqua" -- aileen "kain pa mo ug mais con hielo" -- romeo's half "lagyan natin ng corn flakes..." -- meow "usahay...nagadamgo ako...." -- loloy "goodbye... " -- nay nene "nasamad- samad pa ko..." -- diay-diay "sniff-sniff" -- manghud ni gaga "bagsakan natin..." -- the coach "ipes may gagawin pa ba ako, antok na antok na kasi ako e..." --daboi "unsa man je, dili ka nag-uli?" -- melekoi "di ko sya dinedefend, kasi sa totoo lang naiinis din ako sa kanya..." -- the coach "oi ang liquidations ninyo..." -- igsuon ni daday "kaon ta'g durian!" -- wudz "o hi dan, keep in touch ok, keep in touch..." -- dom from da "nagkapoy ko 'pe, kay duha ka semanaha na ko'g walay tulog-tulog" -- geruncio "... di ko na kaya je" -- sillyoldmebeingsillyagen "tang-ina!" -- daboi "...ewan ko ba communication problem siguro" -- kj  some of the words said and heard, but am sure this GA would surely be a turning point of everything... so might as well remember it in its craziness too.
