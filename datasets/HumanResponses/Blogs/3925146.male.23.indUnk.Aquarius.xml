                 Mike Adams  is another swell guy:   &nbsp;   In his latest column he asks PETA some very serious questions as to why they are such retards   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

                John Kerry thinks that the men and women serving our country don't know what he really did in Vietnam and what he did to his fellow troops who he now apparently seems to adore. They do know, and it is no suprise why very few military personnel support him. A good bit from todays New York Post:   &nbsp;    John Kerry's heavily hyped cross-country bus tour stumbled out of the blocks yesterday, as a group of Marines publicly dissed the Vietnam War hero in the middle of a crowded restaurant.     Kerry was treating running mate Sen. John Edwards and his wife, Elizabeth, to a Wendy's lunch in Newburgh, N.Y., for their 27th wedding anniversary â an Edwards family tradition â when the candidate approached four Marines and asked them questions.     The Marines â two in uniform and two off-duty â were polite but curt while chatting with Kerry, answering most of his questions with a "yes, sir" or "no, sir."     But they turned downright nasty after the Massachusetts senator thanked them "for their service" and left.     "He imposed on us and I disagree with him coming over here shaking our hands," one Marine said, adding, "I'm 100 percent against [him]."     A sergeant with 10 years of service under his belt said, "I speak for all of us. We think that we are doing the right thing in Iraq," before saying he is to be deployed there in a few weeks and is "eager" to go and serve.     The Marines â all of whom serve at nearby Stewart Air Force Base â wouldn't give their names. &nbsp;&nbsp;   At least he had Ben Affleck's support. And one other quote from the article:    "One if by land, two if by sea, and the message was right. Come to think of it, they had better intelligence than we do today about what's going on," Kerry continued, drawing the loudest applause of the event."    Granted, Kerry had all the same information as Bush did when he not only voted for war, but vocalized the need to rid Hussein.    &nbsp;

                Wow, this is really touching. Goes&nbsp;great with the matching "I had unprotected sex and all i got was this lowsy t-shirt (oh, and one dead fetus) - Girl Power!" Pants set. Good old planned parenthood sure does have a way of making the half delivery of a baby and smashing its skull in or vaccuuming its brains out fashionable. ***update*** Pants not included as they leave a potentially impregnable young girl just seconds from not being able to experience the joys of abortion, and getting to buy a t-shirt.   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;     &nbsp;   Proceeds go to funding genocide.

                I picked up an issue of newsweek at work ( it was there, I read it, no other reason) from the week of July 12, to find this gem: The Supreme Court "affirms rights for terror detainees and free speech on the internet. Nice to see they reread the Bill of Rights."   &nbsp;   Ok, #1 the Bill of Rights does not say anything about foreign terrorist rights on foreing soil. Interesting to see Newsweek get all upset over not-restricting porn for children (called: free speach), but weren't to upset about campaign finance reform laws.   &nbsp;   Two more reasons not to read NewsWeek...

                John Kerry to Marry John "Silky Pony" Edwards? Anyone who has seen these two buffoons talk about each other can't help but compare them to that annoying teenage love who are always sitting next to you on the bus groping each other. "Oh yes, Larry! People will see... there is an absolute warmth." - Edwards on Kerry.    &nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;   Rumor has it that since Edwards is worth only 60 million dollars, he may back out from marrying him in Massachusetts. He likes to marry people worth only between 120 million and 1 billion dollars.    &nbsp;    Laura Ingraham listeners  will be in the know.   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

                Why John Kerry is in Trouble:   &nbsp;   1. He has had primetime reporters like Larry King drooling over him and Edwards on a daily basis for a month, the Kedwards team has had nothing but 24/7 positive press coverage about their "dream-team" status and hair.   &nbsp;   but: The polls have not changed, despite:   &nbsp;   2. Having recently announced Edwards as the running mate, which generally has a positive impact; Bush being&nbsp;portrayed as incompetent&nbsp;by all media outside of Foxnews and talk radio; Cheney being constantly portrayed as a liability and his name not&nbsp;capable of being mentioned without a mention of "Halliburton," a company in which he has no financial stake in; The DNC being right around the corner and all the hype it has gotten; The "popularity" of the schlockumentary which has just passed 100 million in the box office; a constant attack of celeb elites who have millions of fans who want to be just like them; constant negative&nbsp;and one-sided press about&nbsp;"prison scandals" and the like. &nbsp;   &nbsp;   He trails in some polls by 1 or 2 and leads in others by 1 or 2. He should be up by 15. I guess it all comes down to one thing:   &nbsp;   John Kerry is still an Ass&nbsp;   &nbsp;       &nbsp;   &nbsp;

                 Vernon Robinson  is headed towards becoming Conservative congressional candidate of the year. He suprised many by&nbsp;leading in the first ballot, and is now headed to a runoff. &nbsp;   &nbsp;   He describes himself as the black Jesse Helms.    &nbsp;   If he wins the runoff (and it looks like he may have the fire to do so), he would likely when the heavily Republican district. Some of his campaign slogans have been: "The only thing I have in common with Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton is a good tan."   &nbsp;   His personal message states:     "I jokingly tell my Democrat friends that their party is made up of  "the Old Left, the New Left, and the What's Left."  I'm proud to tell you that my voting record has infuriated them all:        the pro-abortion fanatics and the radical feminists      the atheists who file lawsuits attacking the Pledge of Allegiance &amp; the Ten Commandments      the gun grabbers, the illegal immigrants, and the trial lawyers      the environmentalist, tree-huggin' granolas and the animal rights extremists      the "one world" globalists who worship at the altar of the United Nations      the militant homosexuals and the burned-out, hippie peaceniks      the race-hustling poverty pimps like Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton      the union bosses and the socialists posing as journalists &amp; college professors      the government bureaucrats &amp; the tax-and-spend junkies who create their jobs, and      the Hollywood elitists - air-headed actors and singers who think  we  care what  they  think. "     I hope he wins as the other candidate, Virginia Foxx, is very uninspiring. The GOP needs the fire in the house.

                Let's see, Liberals (from Senators to celebrities to activists)&nbsp;call Conservatives: racist, sexist, homophobic, nazis, hitler, fascists, baby-killers, the taliban, al-qaeda, and so on on a daily basis. Arnold says "girlie-men" once and the leftists just about lose their minds.    &nbsp;   &nbsp;       &nbsp;   &nbsp;   It's really all quite amusing how  bent out of shape  they get when you associate them with "girlie-men" but have no problem freely associating us with people who fly planes into buildings and committed genocide on millions of people.   &nbsp;   Their whining over this doesn't help their girlie nature much.   &nbsp;   Maybe they will do something productive, like  protest !   &nbsp;

       Hey, I like these guys at  urlLink ProtestWarrior.com .  &nbsp;  I really enjoyed their account of how they crashed their first anti-war protest over a year ago: urlLink Saddamized   &nbsp;   "We grin as his voice is drowned out by a teenage girl screaming into her megaphone: "1 - 2 - 3 - 4! WE DON'T WANT YOUR RACIST WAR!" I wanted to ask her if she would be for war if I can prove to her that race is not a factor. If it is, is she employing some kind of affirmative action policy holding all Islamic dictators to a lower standard of conduct? "5 - 6 - 7 - 8! STOP THE WAR! STOP THE HATE!", she screams. Either way, it didn't look like these issues were open for debate.   I look to my left to see Alan, marching forward with his sign that reads "Saddam Only Kills His Own People. IT'S NONE OF OUR BUSINESS!" I can't help but let out a hearty laugh. "Alan!", I yell. He snaps his head at my           direction. "Will this do?" He smiles and turns his attention back to carrying his sign. I had delivered on my second promise.   As I flip my sign to its other side, a man in a jogging suit and Birkenstocks inspects Alan's other slogan: "Communism Has Only Killed 100 Million People" LET'S GIVE IT ANOTHER CHANCE."   With a straight face, he says "Communism isn't necessarily evil. America has given it a negative slant." "Negative slant?", I ask, dumbfounded. "So how do the Cubans found half-dead on the shores of Miami ever get a bias against communism? From their subscriptions to the Limbaugh Letter?" He proceeds to lecture me on Bush's stolen election and the evils of corporations, and finishes off listing the various uses of hemp (which he claimed totaled two hundred). Considering his political and economic views, I say "Don't you mean two hundred and one?" He laughs and walks away."     &nbsp;  Currently they are organizing to protest the protesters at the Republican Convention... tempting.    &nbsp;

      So the arbitron ratings were released this week for talk show hosts. This was the first release since Airhead America began broadcasting. Franken (the one who looks like a shriveled mr potato head) said a few months ago that he was  urlLink beating Rush Limbaugh there .   The "we beat Rush" BS was played over and over on many a liberal website. It's New York City for crying out loud. By sheer number they should beat Limbaugh. But when Drudge posted the real numbers today... oops. Not only did they have half the audience of Rush in NYC on average, but they steadily dropped listeners each month (about a 25% audience drop each month). Not good news.   Why does their formula not work? 1. Because they use comedians. Who are the successful conservative radio show hosts? Rush, Boortz, Hannity, Ingraham, Savage, etc. These are not comedians. Airhead Radio is trying to combat this with a washed-up SNL character who isn't that funny, a washed up comedienne who was never funny (truth about cats and dogs?) a rapper, and a hyperventalating blond based in Palm Beach County. The last one (Rhodes) I get the "pleasure" of hearing down here in South Florida. After the 2000 election she actually blamed radio stations for causing the election to go Bush's way because no one aired her show in Florida. Only Palm Beach County which went heavily democratic because of her show. If only she was aired in Pensacola! Hey dumbo, Palm Beach was heavily democratic before you and will be long after you leave (unfortunately) so get over yourself. Thanks.  Their other problem is sucky topics and guests. A  urlLink quick look at their line-up  for Fridays shows that "W's professor Yoshi Tsurumi from Yale, who will help us analyze the tepid academic output of the Lesser Bush." Exciting...  ::yawn::  The only liberal on the radio who isn't just flat out moronic is Alan Colmes...

      Hmm, everyone keeps talking about Dick Cheney leaving. Aint gonna happen. One, Bush is far too loyal, and despite what the media reports (daily) Cheney is a party favorite. If Bush believed that the vice-presidency was a popularity contest (Edwards has better hair!) then he might dump Cheney in favor of someone more "appealing." Keep Chenehy, he is the most experiences out of all four people running for either president or vice.

      Whoopsie! If anyone doesn't remember Joseph Wilson, its time to do some backtracking. Wilson is the man who "debunked" the 16 words in Bush's SOTU address about british intelligence, uranium, and Iraq trying to get their hands on it. Now, the report he handed to the CIA was different than the information he gave to the CIA. So it would have it, the evidence in the report (as opposed to what he said to the committee, essentially "Bush Lied") actually further enhanced the belief that Iraq tried to buy Uranium. Robert Novak  urlLink talks about it here

      You have to love the double speak from liberals in the Senate. Their opposition to the constitutional marriage amendment is, not because they believe in gay marriage, but because they believe in... state's rights! When was the last time a democrat believed in state's rights?!? Hillary Clinton, defender of states rights... yeah... riiiight

      In last weeks  urlLink coulter column , we got a bit of this    What is so amazing about Edwards' father being a millworker? That's at least an honorable occupation -- as opposed to being a trial lawyer. True, Edwards made more money than his father did. I assume strippers make more money than their alcoholic fathers who abandoned them did, too. This isn't a story of progress; it's a story of devolution.   Never get enough, neva eva eva

                Bush is  urging  Kerry to say yes or no on the Iraq War. Bush has said yes, he would do it all over again.    &nbsp;   Really, we all want to no. Will Kerry say:   &nbsp;   Yes, the war was right, or it was wrong, or was it right before it was wrong. Or is it wrong because Bush is doing it, or is it right but Bush is doing it wrong.

                I'm beginning to guess that John Kerry wishes he never started to trump up his Vietnam days.    &nbsp;   From the  www.Drudgereport.com  about a new book from Kerry's former war "buddies"   &nbsp;   &nbsp;     ANTI-KERRY VETS GATHER FOR ASSAULT; BOOK CLAIMS KERRY WAR 'FABRICATIONS'   **Exclusive**  A veterans group seeking to deeply discredit Democrat John Kerry's military service will charge in the      new bombshell book UNFIT FOR COMMAND     :       Two of John Kerry's three Purple Heart decorations resulted from self-inflicted wounds, not suffered under enemy fire.    All three of Kerry's Purple Hearts were for minor injuries, not requiring a single hour of hospitalization.    A "fanny wound" was the highlight of Kerry's much touted "no man left behind" Bronze Star.    Kerry turned the tragic death of a father and small child in a Vietnamese fishing boat into an act of "heroism" by filing a false report on the incident.    Kerry entered an abandoned Vietnamese village and slaughtered the domestic animals owned by the civilians and burned down their homes with his Zippo lighter.    Kerry's reckless behavior convinced his colleagues that he had to go -- becoming the only Swift Boat veteran to serve only four months.    &nbsp;

                In what is turning out to be an unprecedented, uhh, precedent, John Kerry has not only not gotten a bounce from the latest polling data, but has dropped.    &nbsp;    USA TODAY/CNN/Gallup Poll finds "Kerry trailed Bush 50%-46% among likely voters. Independent candidate Ralph Nader was at 2%.      &nbsp;    The survey showed Kerry losing 1 percentage point and Bush gaining 4 percentage points from a poll taken the week before the Boston convention."    &nbsp;   Oops. Traditionally, after a covention the candidate picks up a good chunk of change-o   &nbsp;   Also,    &nbsp;      A Newsweek poll taken Thursday and Friday gave the Democrats a 49%-42% lead. Over three weeks, that reflected a 4-point "bounce" for Kerry, the smallest ever in the Newsweek poll.    After the no-bounce from the Edwards announcement, and now this... the Democrats have to worry about not losing the support they have. Watch out...
