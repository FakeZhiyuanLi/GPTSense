      I'm not quite sure when the transition happened, but somewhere along the way I became an adult. Oh sure, I certainly still refer to myself as a kid and I still feel like a kid trapped in a grown-up world, but nonetheless, the unthinkable has happened.  &nbsp;  I started realizing thinking about this during last weekend. I spent 3 wonderful days with my closest friends from college. Alternatively termed, "Tovapalooza" and "Surprise, You're Making Aliyah" the weekend was one last hurrah before I head off (in just&nbsp;14 days).&nbsp; The nature of our conversation has changed drastically over the years...and the things we made fun of people for in college have now surfaced in our lives...stressing out about&nbsp;marriage and kids, real estate, insurance, etc...  &nbsp;  The thought process has continued all this week as I have been trying to cram my entire life into suitcases and boxes. Now, I've made every effort to get rid of as many of my belongings as possible, but I'm left with an impossible number of books, photo albums and mementos that I just can't throw out. It hit me while buried deep in Khafka and Jane Austen that I've actually done a fair number of interesting things in what seems to me like a very short time.&nbsp; I've also been reminded of many things that I hadn't thought about in awhile, and it made me sad to realize that I am starting to forget events that at the time really seemed important.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      So, yesterday was America's 228th birthday, but it took me until 10pm on July 4th to even think about that. I've never been the biggest of patriots, not because I dislike many of America's foreign and domestic policies, or because I'm one of those anti-Bush democrats (both of which are true) but because I never instinctively felt a strong emotional attachment to this place. This, perhaps, may be born of a lack of appreciation for the freedom and opportunities here...Clearly I've never lived anywhere else where I didn't have those. I certainly admire the ideals under which this country was founded, and which, to some extent, guide us today, but I just can't get very excited about. I'll admit to some emotion while watching the fireworks and listening to the Boston Pops play some good ole American songs, but it was fleeting at best.   I've thought about this a lot, and one of the major reasons I don't feel sad to be leaving here is that in such a big country, with so many people, I just don't feel personally invested in what goes on. My efforts, my votes, my life can never create the impact or changes I would want here. The other thing is that after 228 years, while America is still figuring out this democracy thing, it's not new, it's not exciting, and the truth is, I don't think we think creatively about it any more. It's no longer some crazy experiment, America more or less knows how to go about it's business. I guess that's what's appealing about Israel...over there, they are still trying to figure out how democracy is going to work. It's exciting to be a part of something so new.

      Today marks the five-week countdown to the use of my free, one-way ticket to Israel. It seems logical to me that if a country wants you to pick up and move that they should pay for your trip over...my friends, however, find it endlessly funny, and perhaps somewhat dire, that I have a free one-ticket anywhere.  It also strikes me as an auspicious time to start some sort of public record for this major transition in my life. In part, I am admitting to my inability to keep in good touch with a lot of people, in part it's my laziness and lack of patience to repeat the same things over and over again, and finally, it will give you some insight into why I've made this crazy decision and if it turns out to be the right choice.  When I think about the reasons I've decided to make aliyah (when we talk about moving to Israel, Jews always use the term aliyah, meaning "going up," as in going up to a higher spiritual place. I hate the term and will probably never use it again) it's actually easier for me to list the reasons that are NOT behind my decision.  I'm not moving to Israel for religious reasons. I'm not moving there for serious Zionist reasons. I'm not running away from anything in America, and I'm not running to anyone in particular in Israel.   I spent a year in Israel after college, and it never quite left my system. There are lots of little things that I love (the cheese, the weather, the language) and lots of little things that I hate (the politicians, the inefficiency, etc) but I just feel right being in Israel. So, around September of last year, I made the decision that I was going to come back, and really try building my life there...a proposition that is both exciting and terrifying.   So, now you've gotten a taste of my verbosity...I apologize for the rambling, but this project, after all, is in large part for me!  Layla tov (good night)

      This is it. In just a few hours I take off to start my adventures in Israel. In some ways, it's anti-climactic. I made the decision to go nearly a year ago now and my whole year has been focused on this day. Now that it's finally here, what will I do with myself. For a year I've been "making aliyah" and that was my identity. I guess I'll have to find a new mission in life.  In a way I feel blessed. How often do you get to  see a dream through to fruition? So, I'm off to put my bags in the car, and leave Brooklyn for the last time. See you on the otherside.
