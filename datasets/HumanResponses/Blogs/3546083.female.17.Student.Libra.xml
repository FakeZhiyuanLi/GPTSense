      sometimes life just sucks... as if it isnt enuff bing completely and utterly confused with everything goin on w/ a certain somebody, my brother is now bing tossed out on the streets. my aunt just found out he was lying about his job. he said he was gonna quit cuz he didnt like the way they ran things there, and they were firing everybody who was makin over $10 an hour 2 hire on idiots 4 minimum wage. so he was lookin 4 another job. come 2 find out, he had gotten fired, and was only pretendin 2 b at work these past couple weeks. something about him not writing reports 4 all the calls he took, which he claims is crap and was just an excuse 2 fire him. i believe him, but of course r aunt and uncle dont. its not fair. i know he lied 2 them but he had good reason. i was mad 2 at first but then he explained 2 me y he couldnt tell them. he said they would never understand, and would somehow make it out like it was his fault. and i completely agree bcuz they do that all the time. thats y i never tell them nething. but not like they would ever understand that. so like my bro said, its a catch 22. if u tell them, then they turn it back on u, bcuz no matter wut it was that happened, it was somehow ur fault. yet if u dont tell them, u still get in trouble. so i understand y he didnt tell them, even tho he did make things worse. they definitely wouldnt have thrown him out just 4 gettin fired if he had told them the truth (even if it was his fault, which it wasnt). im still a little hurt that he couldnt have at least told me the truth. i wouldnt have told. he said he didnt want ne1 knowing. even tho sarah galloway, his ex g/f knew, and told me a while ago, but when i brought it up 2 him, he told me exactly wut he told aunt cheryl. even tho he claims that he told sarah galloway the exact same thing he told me, and she just somehow misinterpreted it and came up with the truth. its a stretch, but ill believe it. i feel like im the only 1 who understands him nemore, and i cant turn my back on him like evry1 else has done. there r 2 sides 2 evry story, and mayb im bing naive, but i dont think half of his excuses r as far-fetched as my aunt and uncle say they r. mayb if they would just take the time 2 listen 2 his reasoning. but no, like always they have 2 assume the worse. wut am i gonna do when he's gone? he's the only 1 in this house who understands how psychotic and unreasonable aunt cheryl really is. i couldnt believe it when he told me about how she always twists things so its somehow ur fault. i thought it was just me. but after he's gone, it will b only me. abi's her little princess who can do no wrong, she only yells at timmy when he deserves it, and she has my uncle right under her thumb. but me, im the perfect 1 4 her 2 take out all her frustrations on. i came 2 her when i was young enuff, young enuff 2 b retaught evrything, or so she thought. so she decided 2 go the hardest on me bcuz, between me and my brother, i was the only one young enuff 4 her 2 b able 2 change. so she decided 2 take out all her anger toward r mother on me. i not only had 2 b completely responsible 4 myself, i had 2 b responsible 4 evrything abi and timmy did, and even my brother. but now im 17, and i havent conformed yet 2 the perfect daughter she always wanted me 2 b, so shes desperate. so now she finds things that i hadnt the least bit of control over and somehow makes it my fault. i have so much more responsibility than my brother, and thats only cuz she had long since given up on ever changing him. so she's come 2 c him as a parasite, taking everything from her and giving nothing back. taking her time, hopes, and money from her, and not caring. but that isnt it. he's tried 2 change. he changed so much, but it wasnt good enuff 4 her. nothing ever is. but its ok. i agree w/ her that theres nothing else she can do 4 him. hes 22, and he needs 2 make it on his own. i just wish it didnt have 2 b that way. i didnt realize how much i've come 2 like him since he moved in a few years ago. not like i ever didnt like him b4. but we were younger then, and sibling rivalry was definitely an issue. but now, things r different. we're both older, and i have the brother i always wanted, but never thought i would have. we understand eachother a lot more. sometimes, we're the only ones who understand eachother. and we talk about stuff and do stuff 2gether, and i dont feel like such a pest like i did when we were younger. im gonna miss it. it was good while it lasted, i just wish it didnt have 2 end. but i guess i should b glad. i got 2 experience all sides of the spectrum. i got 2 b the younger sister 4 most of my childhood. then i moved here and i was the older sister. then my bro moved in and now im the middle child. but i guess now its back 2 bing the older sister. not evry1 gets 2 experience all sides of it like that. but i have 2 say, i think i definitely enjoyed bing the younger sister. i used 2 wonder wut it would have been like if my little bro had survived, and i could b the big sister. i told myself that i would never treat him the way jim treated me, and i would take him everywhere w/ me and not just cuz mom told me 2. and he would look up 2 me just like i look up 2 jim. but its just a dumb old fantasy. and now i realize that it was better this way. not only was i the baby, but i was my dad's only child, and he gave me evrything he could 4 12 years of my life. and i wouldnt trade that 4 nething. mayb he wasnt always the best parent, but he was always there when i needed him. and i wouldnt have wanted 2 share that w/ nebody, not even my own brother. so i guess evrything does happen 4 a reason. so i can only hope this will eventually turn out ok 2. it has 2... well there it is, everything thats running through my mind 2night. and i've worked myself in2 tears. y did i have 2 bring all this out? im crying 4 stuff now that i havent cried 4 in a long time...

      that run yesterday was the worse! i went 2 the striders camp, and dave and gitterman were there, so i decided just 4 fun 2 c how long i could run w/ them. big mistake lol. i stayed w/ them 4 the 1st mile of the 6, which i thought was pretty good, but then i died. and the last 5 miles i was just tryin 2 keep sum1 in sight so i wouldnt get lost. that was my only motivation 4 not walking. and god i was in so much pain! but i stayed w/ gitterman long enuff 4 him 2 tell me that he was proud of me this year :-) thought of the day: evrytime i try 2 convince myself that i dont care about pleasing other people, i realize that im just like evry1 else, and i thrive  on praise. i think i've been tellin myself i dont care about other ppl's opinions because i feel like i cant please them. so g-man sayin he was proud of me made my day! *contemplating: is that the only reason i run?* ok, mayb i do wanna please other ppl, but i wont change myself 2 do it. like irina dying her hair 2 get ppl 2 like her. but its not just that. i think this whole change that she went through was 2 get ppl 2 like her. guess that kinda backfired on her. and then theres kenny, who's gonna dye his hair blue 2 b popular (and he admitted that was the reason). but he said he wouldnt if i didnt want him 2. y should i care? i never c him. im just worried about how far he'll go 2 get ppl 2 like him. and then me and irina were talkin about the new shrek movie, and she said they were so stupid cuz they chose 2 go back 2 bing ogres instead of a prince and princess. i think she totally missed the moral of the movie. but that duznt surprise me. its just sad. but on a lighter note, i talked 2 tony 2day, and he's comin over on thur. so that should b fun. hes not 2 thrilled about it tho. he wanted 2 go do somethin, but i know my aunt would never let me. cuz u know how they like 2 pretend im 12 years old. god forbid i have a friend who's my own age. but wutever. then i have a job interview on thur. im kinda nervous. i saw lucas 2day, i was so happy! he used 2 come 2 my aunt's daycare, and he was my baby! he got so big tho, hes 4 now, and he's goin 2 kindergarten next year. and somebody stop me from strangling kenny! "man, these overseas girls just love me!" when is he gonna realize that i dont care! i dont go tellin him about my love life, first of all bcuz its not fair 2 him, and second of all bcuz its none of his business. man, im ready 4 school 2 b over! 2 more days. if these tests dont kill me first. well at least i didnt take an ECD exam cuz we already wrote a case study instead. so i was glad 4 the break b4 my gov test. but yea we just presented r case studies and had donuts and stuff. which was good, considering i woke up at 6:50 this mornin, and didnt eat breakfast. so that was cool. i just finished writin my formula sheet 4 algebra 2morrow, and im takin a break b4 studyin 4 bio. i might b goin 2 the mall in a little while. ill study when i get back. or mayb ill go 4 a run when i get back and study later. hmmm, a run sounds much more appealing. so i guess i should go now. i think i've written 2 much. lol i didnt know i had that much 2 say.

      im sittin in soft apps (again) on the last full day of school (yay!)i saw anthony at target yesterday, but i had 2 leave so we didnt really get 2 talk. i also talked 2 kenny online yesterday. he asked me 2 go 2 the mall w/ him 2day, and he was kinda comin on 2 me. but i had 2 turn him down. as tempting as it is, i cant give in2 him, ill only get hurt again. besides, im grounded neway. thats kinda a long story. ok, we were gone all day yesterday at my uncles house, so i didnt get 2 study. so when we finally got back at 8 last night, i was hopin i could study 4 finals. but my aunt wanted me 2 do a bunch of other stuff, so im finally like no, this is stupid and i need 2 study. so i got grounded. i feel like nothin i do is ever good enuff 4 them. i cant even get my liscence cuz i dont know my way around or wutever. it duznt help when theyr yellin at me while im drivin either. but wutever, i dont care. ill just get it when im like 30, and i move out... so i took my spanish final this mornin. it would have been easy if we had time 2 do it. and it didnt help that ms. williman never shut up! and then in the middle of the test she interrupts us 2 ask if we wanted some fig nutons that she brought back from spain, then she passes around the package 4 us 2 c, and we're like we dont care, we just wanna finish this test. but at least i got done. man, i cant wait 4 school 2 b done.

      i cant give in 2 the jealousy, i cant make my true feelings known. partially bcuz its 2 late, but partially bcuz its 2 dangerous. i dont dare risk it again. and i cant give in2 these feelings. this is exactly how he wants me 2 feel, and i wont give him that satisfaction, the satisfaction of knowing he is tearing my heart apart. but i have 2 believe that there is some1 out there meant 4 me, who will not inflict this kind of pain, and take pleasure in my suffering. i have 2 keep hoping...

      Hey everybody, so yea this is my little journal type thing where im gonna write a bunch of stuff about me and wuts goin on in my life and all my thoughts on stuff. so i guess ill start now... lets c, wuts goin on w/ me... its finally friday! :-) wut else? hmm... i started an xc camp yesterday w/ irina and sachi. first time i ran in 4 days. it felt pretty good. im doin the laurel 5k 2morrow w/ irina. should b interesting. mr gitterman said he wants 2 know my 5k time, so hes makin me do it. should b fun tho, it doesnt sound 2 competitve. so yea i have 2 get up at like 6 in the mornin 2 b there by 7. my goal is under 22 minutes. i think i might b able 2 do it. then im babysittin 4 the burensteins (sp.?) 4 the rest of the day. i love joel, hes so cute! hes only 3 but hes so smart and u can carry on a conversation w/ him like u could a 10 year old. he brought up an interesting point the last time i watched him. he was talkin about his super hero action figures, and how he watches them on t.v. then he started talkin bout the stuff that the bad guys did, and he said that the bad guys were scary. i asked him y he liked it if they were scary, and he said if there were no bad guys, we wouldnt need the good guys. really made me think. lol ill hav 2 start a book on all the things we can learn from a 3 year old. then his brother matthew always makes me tell him a story b4 he goes 2 bed and i hav 2 make it up. i cant make up stories. so last time i just read him some of my once and future king book. he liked it. but i dunno wut im gonna do this time. mayb ill read him beowulf, i bet he'll like that... but neway, im so exhausted! i havent been in bed b4 11 a single night this week. and ive been so stressed! teachers gotta wait till june 2 start piling the work on. plus tryin 2 find a job, and evrythin else goin on, i feel like im losin my mind. then tuesday night i was talkin 2 kenny online, and he was talkin bout how he cut his wrist, and he wanted 2 kill himself. so i was up till like midnight talkin 2 him. i made him promise 2 go c the counselor the next day and he did. then i didnt hear from him at all till just a little while ago when he IM'd me 2 say that he was at the hospital and he finally got help, so im happy 4 him. ive been so worried. but its all cool now, at least i hope it is... my aunt's been pretty grumpy lately (actually thats an understatement!) shes worried about finding a place 4 stephanie (my disabled cuz who is in residential). i guess they thought they were gonna get funding 4 the place shes in now, and that didnt work out so now they have 2 move her. so i guess i cant blame her 4 bing a lil on the grumpy side, but shes made evry1 else's life a living hell. but she seemed in a better mood 2day, so i got up the nerve 2 ask her if i could go to this concert on september 19. she said yea, and she even offered 2 pay 4 my ticket! and it happens that thats the weekend she and my uncle r leavin 2 go 2 jamaica, and so my grandparents r comin in from MA 2 watch the kids, and theyre goin 2, and my aunt's even gonna pay 4 their ticket as an anniversary present. i couldnt believe it. but its gonna b so much fun, i cant wait! irina's goin 2. mayb i should call her bout it and tell her that my aunt's orderin the tickets... nah, ill c her 2morrow at the race. so i guess i should get 2 bed now, cuz i wanna b all rested 4 that run 2morrow. lol but that wont happen cuz even if i go 2 bed now i wont fall asleep 4 like 2 hours. but im gonna go neway, cuz i think i've written enuff 4 now. ill check in 2morrow and let u know how my race was.

      *gasp* o no! i 4got 2 pack paper bags 4 the kids' art project! so my aunt said she can never trust me 2 do nething again, and shes gonna get some1 else 2 do my job. but wutever. i really dont care. she always has 2 make such a big deal out of everything. now i know where abi gets it from. but the thing i dont understand is that if she thinks she cant trust me, then y does she still ask me 2 do stuff? like she knows she cant trust my bro, and thats y he doesnt have 2 do nething, and she puts it all on me. it sux having 2 b the responsible 1, when my bro is 5 years older than me. o, and thats another thing. jim came 2 her 2day and read her an email that his boss had sent out 2 all employees bragging about him and how hes so smart and he has the tools 2 get the job done right. he just wanted 2 show her that he wasnt as worthless as she always makes him out 2 b. but was she impressed? of course not. she said that employers always say stuff like that 2 new employees 2 boost their confidence and it duznt mean nething unless u live up 2 it (implying of course that he never will). she just cant accept the fact that he may have found success. i guess thats cuz she's been tryin 2 change him 4 5 years and it hasnt worked yet. so if he's all of a sudden changing now, it must b on his own. and she duznt wanna believe that. she needs 2 feel like it was all her, and no1 else had nething 2 do w/ it. i think thats the only reason she ever took me in. 2 prove 2 my parents and everybody else that she could raise me right and they couldnt. and of course she thinks that shes the one who changed me, and it had nothing 2 do w/ me. its all just one big childish game...i wish i could tell her that she had nothing 2 do w/ it. i changed myself and i didnt do it 4 her. she thinks shes responsible 4 ne success ive had.

      so i spent most of 2day w/ the daycare kids, training the new assistant. the newer new one lol. her name is jennifer. shes so much better than the other one! shes so enthusiastic and the kids love her and she actually wants 2 work. plus theres a new daycare kid. his name is david and hes autistic. which means he cant talk and he uses sign language, which i dont really know lol. and he has a lot of behavior problems. but its no biggie now cuz hes only 3. but when he gets 2 b older... well yea, i know how that is lol: *cough* stephanie! but yea neway, we were playin outside w/ the kids and he started throwing a fit cuz we wouldnt let him climb up the slide. so i brought him inside kicking and screamin while jennifer stayed out w/ the other kids. and how did i calm him down? food of course! haha and he was doing all these signs and i had no idea wut he was sayin cuz he cant speak a single word. so im tryin 2 remember wut all these things mean. so i finally figured out he wanted 2 eat. i gave him some goldfish, but he didnt want those, he kept signing 4 somethin but i didnt know wut it was. so i was kinda subconsciously moving my hands like "i dont know". and hes lookin at my hands like he thinks im tryin 2 say somethin and hes lookin all confused like "wuts that mean?" and i thought it was funny. i never did find out wut he wanted but i did get him calmed down, and brought him back outside. he has his problems but hes such a sweety! hes happy most of the time, and sooo affectionate! i love him!... but neway, i left around 5 2 go babysit gavin and connor and i just got back like an hour ago. abi came, but her dad picked her up at 8:30. man, i was about 2 strangle both her and gavin by that time! they just wouldnt get off eachother's necks! but all was well again after she left lol. so then i put gavin 2 bed at 9. then me and connor hung out 4 a little while. lol hes my little buddy! then i sang him 2 sleep at 9:30 with "whiskey lullabye". haha i know its depressing but he seemed 2 like it. fell right 2 sleep lol. i sat w/ him 4 a little while admiring his innocence (awwwww!) then i carried him upstairs and put him in his little crib, rubbed his back, tucked him in, kissed him, and went back downstairs. lol i know but i cant help it! haha i havent rocked a baby 2 sleep in so long, i missed it! then i just sat downstairs watching tv and reading at the same time (yes, im that good! lol) then when i came home i realized that i was locked out of my house and every1 was in bed, except my bro who i knew was down in the basement hopelessly out of hearing distance lol. so i went around 2 the side door but that was locked 2, so i tried the window on the deck, but that was locked 2. so i went 2 the other window, the one thats like 5 feet off the ground, and that one happened 2 b open lol. so i had myself a grand ol time tryin 2 climb up there. haha short little ol me! but i made it... eventually lol. and no1 even woke up. i coulda been a burglar or somethin and no1 would ever know. the dogs didnt even bark! haha some guard dogs they r! they only bark when we dont want them 2! well its like after 1 now, so mayb ill get 2 bed, lol but mayb not... ;-)

      so i ran 6 miles 2day. lol it was really slow cuz i havent been running much lately. but i still thought it was over 2 quickly. i know it sounds weird, but i was so deep in thought i 4got i was running...  i was thinking about life and y i run and how part of me thinks im gonna live 4ever and never get old. i know it sounds stupid, but it really feels like that. i just cant comprehend the concept of death or old age right now. i c it all the time, but im always thinkin 2 myself "that will never b me." but then i realized that a part of me must know im gonna die some day cuz im always feeling the pressure 2 get done everything i wanna get done in this world, and try everything at least once. and i guess thats y im such a thrill-seeker. i just dont wanna leave this world knowing there was even 1 thing left untried. and so here's my list of all the things i need 2 do b4 i die: (i think tim mcgraw just about covered it all)  skydiving bungee jumping rock climbing deep sea diving parasailing jet skiing water skiing bull riding swim with dolphins visit at least 3 other countries ride every rollercoaster i get the chance 2 at least once everything im scared 2 do love and b loved unconditionally b the kind of friend a friend would like 2 have live my life so i have no regrets (more 2 b added)  so thats my list of evrything i have 2 do b4 i die. i guess i better get workin on it lol.  then i started thinking about my mom and dad and how lucky i am that i've had the opportunity 2 realize how much i love them. cuz when u live w/ them, evry little thing they do annoys u, and u take out all ur frustrations on them, and u never get the chance 2 realize how much they mean 2 u. but im lucky, and it took me till now 2 realize it. ive been given the chance 2 discover how much they mean 2 me b4 its 2 late. now i just need 2 find a way 2 tell them b4 its 2 late...  yea so i was definitely in the poem-writing mood 2day, i just never got a chance 2 write ne lol. mayb ill go do it now, if i havent lost all my inspiration lol.

      i just found out my grandparents r on their way here RIGHT NOW and will b here 2night. i cant wait! and they're bringing my cousins DJ and Megan, and Macayla who's not really my cousin but she's DJ and Megan's half sister. lol that part is kinda confusing. and they're also bringing some other little girl who i've never met who i guess is DJ and Megan's cousin. something like that. so yea, they're all staying at r house 2night and DJ and Megan and Macayla's mom who isnt really my aunt nemore (confusing!) is coming 2 pick them and that other girl up and bring them home cuz they live in virginia but they've been staying with my grandparents in massachusetts 4 the last month. but my grandparents r staying here till thursday, then they're leaving 4 st. louis 2 bring some of my aunt's conference stuff early and we're gonna meet them there on saturday with the rest of it. fun fun! it hasnt been that long since i saw my grandparents, but its been a while since i saw DJ and Megan. and of course Macayla, who i've only met once! so this should b fun. mayb we'll go swimming again like we did when they came last summer. i think that was the last time i saw them. good times... but i still wanna c tony again b4 i leave 4 st. louis. so mayb we can do something 2morrow or thursday. o, i almost 4got! tony remembered that yesterday was r 2-week anniversary! i thought that was the sweetest thing in the world! neway, tony said hes gonna call me 2day so i guess ill just sit here and wait 4 his call lol. im pretty bored right now. i could call irina, but i think she went swimming with zack. haha she invited me 2 go, but i said i would feel a little awkward just being there w/ the 2 of them lol. i think i need 2 go on a run, cuz i desperately need it, then mayb ill call tiffany and c if she wants 2 go 2 the pool. i need someone 2 run with tho. i guess im stuck running by myself since tony prolly wont go. but i better go now b4 i change my mind lol.

THE BEST ROLLERCOASTER EVER!!!! man, it was awesome! haha did i mention how much i LOVE that rollercoaster? yea so then we all played the water race thing, and i won but i gave my prize 2 abi's friend cuz she was the only one who hadnt won nething.  yea, then we stopped in the gift shop, then headed home. omg! we stopped on the way home at KFC, and it was so gross and my twister was all broken cuz the wrap was so old and stale! yea it was really nasty! then i got home and realized that someone had wrecked my puzzle! so i spent like a half hour fixing it. but those were the only 2 things that really went wrong 2day. other than that it was a pretty awesome day! and im definitely doin it 4 my b-day again! and this time mayb tony can come. haha but dont worry, i wont make u go on ne rollercoasters cuz i know how scared u r! haha, just joking. but october is fright fest, so there will b other stuff there, fun stuff! like ppl running after u w/ chain saws! man, im still recovering from last year lol. that is a blast! then of course, the sky coaster but i dont think tony would do that with me either! :-( so i guess id have 2 bring either tiffany or irina just so i'd have some1 2 do that with so i wouldnt have 2 do it alone. cuz that IS scary! haha the first time i did it i did it alone, and i was so scared! then the second time, i did it with rachael and it wasnt much better cuz she was really scared lol. but its soooooo much fun! haha she loved it once it started! so yea, fun stuff! u should do it with me tony! but neway, im gonna go now cuz tony left and no1 is talkin 2 me. mayb ill work on my puzzle 4 a bit b4 bed. haha its still early... kinda lol

      so my boss was like "hey did u know u were supposed 2 b off 2day?" and i was like "if i knew that would i b here?" well i didnt say that, but i was thinkin it. so yes, i misread the schedule like an idiot, and i didnt have 2 work 2day. no, it was actually 2morrow that i had 2 work. but i was plannin on goin 2 six flags, so i got walton 2 cover 4 me. good ol walton, man i owe him big time! but now i dont even know if im goin. tony couldnt go, and wouldnt ride nething even if he could, rachael has 2 work, and irina duznt have ne money. my only hope is that my aunt will pay 4 irina and she will pay her back. i just left a note on the counter asking her, and irina's gonna b calling 2morrow morning 2 find out. it shouldnt b a problem. my aunt is usually nice about that kind of stuff. and the good thing is that note will b the first thing she sees when she goes downstairs in the morning, b4 nething else has a chance 2 tick her off lol, so she should b in a pretty good mood. and if she says no, i guess im just not goin cuz im definitely not goin on rides by myself, and im not hanging out with my aunt and abi and her friend all day... haha irina was mad at me just now cuz i was workin on my puzzle and wouldnt talk 2 her. i told her i'd b on when tony came on, but he never did. so now i guess im goin 2 bed cuz i might b gettin up early in the morning. well, either way i am, but if im not goin 2 six flags, im goin back 2 bed lol.

      so 2day was pretty boring. i didnt get up till 10:30 cuz i didnt go 2 bed till 1:30 last night. then i got 2gether some toys and stuff 4 the conference. lol i accidentally pulled a hard plastic cookie monster down on my face! haha i never claimed 2 b the smartest person in the world. then i went 2 work at 1. that was pretty boring. it was really slow so i just sat around most of the time. i got off at 5:30, then i had 2 go babysit lily, and i got back at 9. so that was my really boring day. i was able 2 switch shifts 4 2morrow so i can go 2 this race, but irina hasnt been able 2 get ahold of david yet. so we'll c how that goes. i think im gonna c if i can register 4 the race online tho so i wont have 2 pay an extra 5 bucks... yea so neway, kenny is really confusing me. 2 days ago he was talkin bout killing himself, yesterday he was all happy, and 2day he writes a poem about a sunset... wierd. but o well, as i recall i've decided not 2 worry about him nemore. but yea tony just got back from his orientation so im talkin 2 him now. i was talkin 2 my mom earlier while i was waiting 4 tony and she was tellin me about 2 ppl that she goes 2 dialysis with who just died, and how u never know when ur time is up. lol i can always count on mom 4 a quick pick-me-upper.its a good thing im never gonna die lol. so yea i guess thats about everything 4 2day...

      i swear this kid has more mood swings than a woman! im talkin 2 kenny now and he's fine. hes more than fine. so far in r conversation that has only lasted 5 minutes, hes put 5 smileys. i think its safe 2 say hes ok. so i definitely think its just the pitty thing. and hey i brushed him off yesterday and he didnt kill himself. so mayb i should do that every time. but how would i know if hes really serious? he might actually decide 2 kill himself one of these days. but i cant b worrying about him all the time... so neway i rode my bike up 2 safeway 2day 2 c about switching shifts with walton. walton was there and i asked him about it. he said some1 had already talked 2 him and he said it was fine but that mindy wanted 2 talk 2 me, i guess 2 confirm it or something. but mindy wasnt there. none of the managers were, so even tho im pretty sure its gonna happen, i couldnt find out 4 certain. so now if i do this race, im gonna have 2 just register saturday and pay an xtra $5, which i guess is worth it. im gonna have 2 borrow some money from my folks tho, cuz im flat broke. im soooo mad! i still havent gotten paid yet. we're supposed 2 get paid every week, and ive been workin there 4 like 3 weeks and i havent gotten a single pay check! but now that i think about it, its prolly cuz of those tax forms that i never turned in. wooopsies. ill have 2 remember 2 bring that 2morrow... so neway, 2day was pretty boring. my aunt woke me up at like 8:45 2 watch the kids so she could leave, and i was still half asleep cuz i didnt go 2 bed till 2 last night. haha but its all good, im not tired now lol. so yea, i watched them this morning, then i had 2 help get ready 4 this conference coming up. i was helping jess all afternoon with filling binders. it was really tedious work lol. irina called and invited herself over again. i said no at first cuz i had a lot of work 2 do, but she promised she would help me with it and wouldnt fool around. so i let her come over, but she lied of course. she didnt help at all. all she did was bug abi and gavin, and eat r food. and she left trash all over the family room and i got in trouble 4 it. i wasnt even in there with her and i didnt even know she had taken ne food. but wutever. i didnt have 2 kick her out 2day tho. she actually went home willingly cuz she said she had 2 clean her house. so after i finished all the work i had 2 do i rode my bike up 2 safeway, then came back and went 2 striders. i had a pretty good run 2day considering i havent run much over the last week. i ran with some girl 2day who i never met b4, and she seems nice. we run about the same pace so it was cool. her name is also sarah (spelled with an h! haha). so that was fun. we ran 6 miles and talked most of the time. we were running a pretty fast pace tho. lol i almost died on the warm-up run, but i guess its true that if u have a bad warm-up u have a good run. so yea then i came home and ate dinner. irina invited me over 2 watch a movie, but i didnt want 2. im such a home-body lol. id much rather b home in front of the computer or watching a movie in my own house lol. so yea here i am just sittin in front of the computer wishing tony was on. mayb ill go work on my puzzle now...

      so it turns out im not gettin my wisdom teeth out 2morrow cuz both my aunt and uncle agreed that the dentist is stupid and its just an infection. i hope thats the case lol. but i feel bad that i didnt tell tony this. hes gonna b worrying about me while hes at his orientation and he has no reason 2. now im gonna feel guilty 4 the next 2 days. and 2 answer ur question from earlier, tony, it duznt bother me that u care so much about me, but it is gonna take some getting used 2 lol. well since u prolly wont read this till u get back from orientation, i hope u had a good time and werent worrying about me the whole time lol... so 2day was fun. tony came over and we walked around the lake (and i didnt get attacked by wild geese :-), then tried 2 play gamecube, but that didnt work so well lol. so then we went 2 the mall, and i made tony go in2 the most girliest stores in the mall and watch me shop 4 clothes lol. (sorry about that tony, but i really didnt wanna b there ne more than u did lol.) so then we tried 2 play gamecube again and succeeded this time. but i never got my hug lol. then i had 2 go 2 work and i listened 2 my aunt ranting and raving about stuff i didnt understand while she drove tony home. then i went 2 work. it was actually ok 2day. i only worked 5-10 and it actually went by pretty fast cuz it wasnt really hard 2day, but it wasnt really boring either. kinda that happy medium if there is one lol. and when there wasnt work 2 b done, i talked 2 my co-workers. lol time never seems 2 drag by when alfred is there (my "mighty green giant" lol). i dont know wut i'd do w/o him. i was so worried that my mouth would start hurting really bad again while i was at work and i didnt have ne pain killers. that would b pretty embarassing if that excruciating pain hit me right in the middle of the store cuz i might have just collapsed on the floor lol. but it didnt. it started hurting a little, but it was nothing i couldnt deal with... i might b able 2 get off saturday night 4 this race. that would b so awesome. i talked 2 one of the managers and they said they would ask walton 2morrow if he can switch shifts w/ me so i can work an earlier shift on saturday. but if i do run it i know its gonna suck since i havent run 2 much in the last week lol.... so yea neway i got home around 10:30, then talked 2 tony online 4 like 5 minutes b4 he had 2 go 2 bed. and now im just sittin here bored as nething wishin i had somebody 2 talk 2 lol. so yea that was my day 2day... im kinda worried about kenny. i kinda brushed him off earlier when he came 2 me 4 help cuz i had 2 go 2 work and i feel kinda bad. i think maybe hes back 2 cutting himself. i wanna help him but im getting so frustrated and i dont know wut 2 do. i thought he was over this, then he comes 2 me swearing that he wants 2 die bcuz they're closing down his karate studio. thats not something that healthy ppl get that upset about, but he swears he took his medicine 2day. i dont know wut 2 do nemore, but i dont think i can help him. mayb its just another one of his pitty pleas and i should just ignore it. or mayb he just wants attention. or mayb he really is goin 2 kill himself over a stupid reason like that and it would b all my fault. but then again, if he really wanted 2 kill himself he would have done it already instead of just making little cuts in his wrist. 2 me it seems like he just wants attention. cuz ppl that really wanna die dont go 2 other ppl 2 b talked out of it. so i think he just needs 2 b told by other ppl  that his life has some sort of value. or mayb just by me. if this is headed where i think it might b headed i need 2 stop this right now. mayb hes only comin 2 me cuz he thinks he'll get pitty and he wants me 2 feel like hes confiding in me, and he thinks ill take him back. i know if he wanted me back, he would never have the courage 2 just come out and ask, so this might b his way of saying it. if thats the case, i dont think i should try 2 help him nemore. but how do i know wuts really going on? should i really just turn my back on him? wut if he really is planning on killing himself, and i was just 2 busy 2 point out the value of his life when he came 2 me? i dont think i could live with that kind of guilt. i need 2 talk 2 him. hopefully he'll b on 2morrow.... so neway now im just sitting here wishing i could talk 2 tony. i dont know wut im gonna do these next 2 days... man some1 better come online soon, im gettin pretty bored. haha my mom IM'd me while i was gone 2 ask me how my date was, isnt that cute lol. but she's not on now. cuz NOBODY is on. lol but mayb thats just cuz its after midnight. ok fine, nobody's comin 2 keep me company, so mayb ill just go work on my puzzle...

      i went 2 the dentist this morning and waited 2 hours b4 they could c me, then another half hour b4 they actually did nething. by the time they called me in it didnt really hurt nemore, but i was sitting in the waiting room 4 2 hours in agony! i brought my book 2 read, but i only read 4 like a half hour cuz after that the pain was so bad i couldnt concentrate on nething i was reading. of course they really didnt do nething. they're stupid and they dont know wut they're talking about. so they said it was my wisdom teeth even tho i know its not. its like an infection or something cuz it just started after i went 2 the dentist last week and they had 2 have done something. but i cant tell these stupid ppl nething. so im gettin them out thursday. im so nervous! i guess i wanna get it over with, but its kinda soon. michelle scheduled her appointment 4 the end of august. so they give her like 6 weeks, and me 2 days. so yea there goes this 5k race i was gonna try and get off work 4. but of course i can still work. its so stupid that i cant work 4 1 day, and i cant run 4 5 days. man im gonna b so out of shape this fall. but neway, i didnt get out of there till 1:30. tony was supposed 2 b comin over at 2, and i was worried i wouldnt make it in time but it turns out he had called 2 say he couldnt come over neway. it was just as well. i havent felt up 2 doing nething 2day. ive been cold all day and really weak and light-headed and dizzy. i tried taking a nap earlier but of course that doesnt work in this crazy house. but at least i laid down 4 5 minutes. i dont know wuts wrong with me. i dont think its the medication cuz the only thing i took this morning was penicillin. i dont know wut kind of side effects that has. but it might have been that cuz im starting 2 feel better now. i was gonna go running 2day. i would have if i hadnt been feeling all crappy. but o well, its just longer b4 i can run again... irina called this afternoon and asked if she could come over and borrow some advil. she sounded really pathetic and swore she didnt have ne in her house so i said ok. so she came over and of course she wouldnt leave. we hung out in my room and worked on my puzzle. well at least i worked on it. she just kinda sat there pretendin 2 b stupid and fitting pieces where they definitely didnt belong. then i had 2 go watch the daycare kids so my aunt could leave and she came with me and was annoying the poor kids the whole time. then she snuck upstairs and i came after her cuz i thought she might b goin 2 read my journal again (she did last time i left her alone in my room). but she was just goin 2 the bathroom. and of course raiding my cabinets 4 food. i wouldnt let her have ne princess fruit snacks tho lol those r eric's special treats. then after gavin and connor left i talked 2 my mom online 4 a little while hoping irina would get bored lol. i guess it worked cuz she left. i didnt wanna b rude, but i was just feeling so horrible and she kept on talking and being annoying when all i wanted 2 do was lay down. so yea she stayed like 2 hours. so shes gone now that im actually feeling better and im gettin bored lol. funny how things work. but i just took some pain medicine like an hour ago. its actually working, but i think its gonna make me reeeeaaaally sleepy lol. so i dont think im gonna go out and do nething. so im just sittin here listening 2 luther vandross and waiting 4 tony 2 come back lol. mayb ill talk 2 my mom while im waiting...

      its almost 11:30 at night and i just got back from my beach trip. had lots of fun. 2night we went 2 the boardwalk and rode some of the rides, then we got ice cream. me and bill must have rode the bumper cars at least 5 times. it was so much fun!  but the best part was the roller coaster! it brings u up in the air then drops u. then when u get 2 the end of it, it does the same thing backwards. i rode in the front row with some lady i dont know, and bill and mary jane were in the row bhind us. bill and the lady made me keep my hands up 4 the whole thing! bill was holding on2 my purse and he said if i didnt he would empty it all over ocean city lol. after the roller coaster bill and my uncle played whac-a-mole and bill won me a stuffed dragon. then we got ice cream. then we went back 2 bill's place, packed up, and came home. so that was my vacation. so now im home talkin 2 tony on IM and gettin my fix of luther vandross lol.

      so yea im still in ocean city. we spent the whole day at the beach again, then we left at 4 and went 2 the pool. now we're back at the house and im just waiting 2 take a shower. had a pretty eventful day at the beach tho. bill and mary-jane came (the friends that we're staying with) and i rode the waves w/ bill. there were a couple really big ones. i almost drowned again but i didnt 4 tony's sake lol. so yea then we saw like 3 sting rays and they came right up 2 us! i was kinda scared but it was cool. then they just swam away. so after i got dragged under again by a huge wave i went up and layed on the beach. then while i was lying there, i hear some guy screaming 2 everybody that he lost his little girl. so the whole beach starts lookin 4 her including us. i went w/ bill off the beach up near the restaurant and condos cuz he thought somebody might have taken her. but they eventually found her. she had just wandered off. yea but bsides that, abi actually went out in the waves 2day! bill took her out on the body board, and actually had her riding the waves. she's never been that daring b4. but she quit after she got knocked off the board lol. so yea that was day 2 at the beach. the adults r gonna b leaving in a bit, so its just gonna b me, abi, and timmy here. and if i can get abi interested in somethin, i could have the computer 4 the rest of the night :-)

      i worked another 8 hour shift 2day. but it was actually ok 2day. now that im startin 2 get in2 it a little and not just standing there clueless the whole time lol. b4 they didnt really ask me 2 do stuff cuz i didnt know how 2 do nething. but 2day some1 actually showed me how 2 do stuff, so i can actually work and not just bag groceries the whole time lol. so it wasnt as boring. i was waiting 4 tony but he never showed up. i guess thats cuz his parents wouldnt let him even tho they were already at mcdonalds lol. but i got 3 visits from mr. watkins! and i saw a family i babysit 4, and irina came up 2 c me. well actually she came up 2 buy some mac & cheese cuz she claims she doesnt have ne food in the house. but she also bought me a bag of m&m's cuz i was starving (note 2 self: bring money 2 work). but she owed it 2 me neway. this was 4 in the afternoon and i hadnt eaten a thing since breakfast at 8 this morning. lol i didnt eat the m&m's tho cuz i thought i was gonna b running that race in 2 hours. that kinda didnt work out tho. its a half hour drive 2 liberty and gavin and conor's dad didnt pick them up till after 5:30 and the race started at 6 so we decided we wouldnt make it. so then irina went home (surprisingly!) i was gonna go 4 a run but we were goin out 4 dinner. i havent run in a few days. im feeling kinda lazy :-/  im goin 2 the beach this weekend tho and im definitely running there. so that should b fun. lol im prolly gonna get lost tho. we're staying with some friends of the family at their beach house in ocean pines. its not right on the beach, but its not 2 far either. i think i might get up early 2 run cuz it would b prettier. i have 2 find the will first tho lol. but i dont think ill b staying up 2 late, cuz i wont have late-night conversations 2 b looking 4ward 2 ;-). but neway, i went over 2 target 2day cuz my aunt needed 2 get somethin and i needed 2 get a bathing suit. i looked 4 tony but i couldnt find him. i dont think he was workin. i couldnt find a bathing suit either. lol i am very picky about wut kind of bathing suits i wear. so i guess ill look 4 one at the beach. except i dont have a penny 2 my name lol. so yea this should b fun. im goin 2 ocean city and i cant spend a dime. but hey, its the beach! who really needs 2 buy stuff at the beach? ... woa i just found a raccoon in my garage. i thought it was one of my cats at first, then i thought it looked pretty fat. then it calmly turned around and faced me and i knew it wasnt my cat. then it calmly turned back and slowly climbed up the wooden plank on the wall and went in2 the rafters. so i guess its still up there. that fact that it didnt really seem scared kinda scared me lol. i think it has rabies. but i was definitely scared of it, so i guess that means im healthy lol.

      fun fun day! (besides the dentist appointment *shiver*). i went 2 c the new king arthur movie with tony. it was pretty good. i kinda zoned out the last half hour tho lol. i was kinda tired. (yes tony, i know! lol). i didnt understand some of it tho. but neway, it was nothing like ne of the king arthur stories i have ever read. so yea, then after the movie tony came over and had dinner and we worked on the puzzle i got the other day when i was stranded at the mall with irina. then we went 2 dics 2 get me a new bike since im never gettin my other one back. so yea that was fun. i had a good time. definitely something i'd like 2 do again. i really like him. he's kinda shy tho. but then again, i shouldnt b talkin lol. but i can live with that. he bought me a necklace :-) i like it :-)  ... i also talked 2 kenny online. told him all about tony. he said he's happy 4 me. and he said if tony ever hurts me, he would beat him up. yea ok, tony prolly dwarfs him by like 2 feet lol. but i didnt tell him that. i just told him not 2 worry about me. then i was tryin 2 figure out wut i should wear, and i told kenny and he said i should wear wut i wore on r first date. i told him i couldnt remember, and he told me! i never thought he actually remembered! yea, then i made him mad... he mentioned that sarah winters was online and he should go and hack her computer. that made me mad cuz he was always talkin bout hacking computers and fighting and stuff when we were goin out then he admitted that he never did ne of that. if there's 1 thing i cant stand its a mucho-man facade. so i was like "stop pretending like u ever could or would do nething like that"... yea note 2 self: never insult a clinically depressed person. at first he got mad then he got really depressed and self-deprecating and started talkin bout how the whole world hates him. but i dont know wut 2 do about him nemore. i cant b talking him out of a suicide attempt every day... but neway, i gotsta get goin. got work in the morning. besides, tony is anxious 2 read this lol.

      wut a horrible rotten day! i was gonna get off work early 2 catch the fireworks. but then it started raining and my aunt called from the campground 2 say they werent goin, and instead they were leavin 4 new york early and would b gone till tuesday. but it think she gave up on the fireworks 2 fast, cuz it cleared up after that. but on top of that, she left the message with my boss, so he knew i could work the rest of the day. so he said if i "wanted" 2 i could work the rest of the day. yea, give me a break, there was no choice in the matter. so 2day was my first 8-hour shift (actually it was 8 and a half), and it was so exhausting! i am soooo tired! but neway, i got off at 7:30 2 find out that my bike had been stolen. i didnt know wut 2 do, so i called my aunt on her cell even tho she was in new york and couldnt do nethin. but i didnt know wut else 2 do. i thought she would b mad, and i almost started 2 cry when i called her cuz i was so scared. but i didnt. and she said that it wasnt my fault and she understood and would get me a new bike. i couldnt believe it. she told me 2 go back inside and ask my boss 2 help me with calling the police and filing a report. so i did. and i didnt lose it at all. of course, i did have 2 sit outside b4 i went in 2 gather myself. i was just so scared. plus, Kandy scares me, even tho all my co-workers tell me she's nice. but she was real nice about it, and even offered me a ride home. but i told her i'd walk. so i think she actually called 911, and she had me talk 2 the guy. he gave me a number and told me 2 call when i got home. yea, exactly wut i wanted 2 do when i finally got out of that place: talk 2 the police. but neway, when she handed me the phone i thought i was gonna lose it. but i saw that she had dialed 9-1-1, and i considered the situation: no1's dying, its just a stolen bike. im sure this guy listens 2 histerical ppl on the phone all day, but they all have good reason. it would look pretty dumb 4 me 2 b crying 2 a 911 dispatcher cuz my bike was stolen. so i got myself under control pretty fast. so i talked 2 him, he gave me the number 2 call, then i walked home and called it. i filed the report, and all is well now. except it duznt sound like they'r gonna do nethin. when i was little me and my bro must have gotten r bikes stolen like 5 times, and we always got them back, cuz the police actually went lookin 4 them. when i was little, it seemed like thats wut they should b doin. but lookin back now, and realizing how many real crimes they have 2 take care of, i think it was pretty nice of them 2 go searching 4 2 little kid's bikes. but i dont expect these police 2. its alright tho. the only thing i regret losing is the odometer on it. but neway, after i got off the phone with the police i realized that its the 4th of july and im sittin at home all alone w/ no fireworks 2 c, and i got even more depressed. and wuts the magic cure 4 depression? ice cream! so i curled up in front of the big screen with my ice cream cone and watched "when harry met sally". i thought i might b able 2 at least hear some fireworks goin off somewhere even if i couldnt c them, but i didnt. at least not till midnight, but they were just illegal ones in the neighborhood. but i felt much better after the movie. that is until i talked 2 tony. or rather, until i heard about his trip. i was glad 2 talk 2 him again, but i dont think he felt the same. but thats a whole other story. so neway, i still have the house 2 myself. i have since friday, and i will till tuesday. it's been awesome. except 4 2day. i kinda wished they were here. but bsides all that, its been pretty sweet. except they barely left nethin 4 food. they did buy some stuff when they came home 2day b4 leaving 4 newyork. but they didnt get ne toilet paper! plus, im kinda gettin lonely. the only human contact i've had in the last 2 days is at work, and lets face it, thats not exactly positive interaction. even tho i am gettin 2 know the ppl there. most of them r pretty nice. 2day i bagged 4 pedro. he was just transferred from another safeway. he's really funny. he's the 1 who really got me 2 loosen up, cuz i've been so shy there since i started. but once i started talkin 2 him, i started talkin 2 most of the other employees. at least the cashiers. cuz the other courtesy clerks dont talk. except alfred. he's cool 2. he showed me around 2day, cuz my bosses sure didnt. jerome's cool 2. but he duznt like me bagging 4 him, cuz he feels like some1's tryin 2 tell him that he's not goin fast enuff. 2 tell u the truth, i dont c the point of baggers. its easier 4 the cashier 2 just stick the stuff in a bag than 2 reach around and hand it 2 some1 else 2 put in a bag. but o well, just a thought. but right now im gonna get goin cuz im exhausted. and i need 2 sort out some feelings i never thought i would b feeling about a person i never thought i'd b feeling this way about. does that make ne sense at all? prolly not. but im long past the point of making sense now. sleep...

      wut a crazy 2 hours at work! i was the only courtesy clerk there, and it was a mess! till alfred came in right b4 i left. but i didnt think ne1 else was comin, so i closed produce. i wouldnt have been nearly as crazy if i'd known i didnt have 2 do that, but o well. at least its over now lol... so neway 2day was the most boring day ever! me and irina rode r bikes up 2 the school 4 schedule changes. first of all, irina shows up at my house a half hour early and gets mad cuz i was still sleeping! yea im still tryin 2 figure that 1 out. but that wasnt the worse of my morning. the school was sooooo crowded and it took soooo long. we finally got out of there 3 hours later w/ nothing changed at all. i was pretty mad. but at least i dont go cussing ppl out when im mad like some ppl we all know. yea so irina was already mad at guidance b4 we got there cuz they screwed up her schedule, and she wrote a nasty letter 2 them about how incompetent they r. but she didnt need the letter cuz she told them face 2 face. so i guess we know y she didnt get her schedule changed lol. then on the bike ride back she got mad at me again and called me a bitch cuz i rode my bike up the hill instead of walking it up w/ her. i was pretty mad, but i didnt really say nething. and the worse part is, she thought i only waited 4 her at the top bcuz she called me a bitch. yea so neway she came back 2 my house and ate some more of my food. then she took abi and gavin swimming, which i was kinda glad about cuz it got them all out of my hair lol. so while they were gone i helped jess unpack conference stuff, and i went 2 the storage shed w/ her 2 put it all away. and while we were there i picked up one of the books they were selling at the conference but i was 2 broke 2 buy lol. its called "purple stew" and it was written by one of the joubert parents. so ill look 4ward 2 reading that. i also wanna c the video of all the stuff i missed from the conference, but my uncle hasnt burned it 2 dvd yet. but neway, i might b goin camping 2morrow if it duznt rain, then im goin 2 the fair on saturday. since tony couldnt go i invited irina. cuz shes always mad cuz she thinks i never do stuff w/ her. which is not true. lol so this should b fun...

(as john turns around and looks at me weird) "wait, i mean--what?"  haha good times

      so i spent all this morning cleaning cuz i thought my aunt and uncle were comin home earlier. but then i called them and they said they'd b home around 7. but at least i got it all out of the way lol. but i went 4 a run around 5, and they were here when i got back. i had another horrible run, even worse than yesterday lol. but i think its just cuz i've barely eaten the last 2 days. but its all good, i have food now! lol. omg, when i was running around the lake, i saw this cute little boy who looked like he was like 2, and i didnt c ne adult. i was about 2 ask him where his mom was, but i didnt. lol he said hi 2 me when i ran by, then he started running and tried 2 race me. and the sad part is, he almost kept up w/ me lol. i would have slowed down but i didnt want him following me all the way home lol. that would b bad. id b like, yea i have this kid, and i dont know wut 2 do w/ him! lol. o, i might get in2 SAT prep. ms. beall emailed me back and told me 2 talk 2 guidance, and if they say they cant do it she'll talk 2 them. haha, shes so awesome! i cant wait 4 xc, its gonna b great!  well i finally got around 2 writing that poem lol. here it is:  "I'll never hurt you" is what he always said. He promised me the moon; I got loneliness instead. Broken dreams lay in tiny shards wedged deep within my broken heart. So i condemned myself to a life of isolation. In sad loneliness I would await salvation. And now like a fool I've fallen once more For this same old feeling That deceived me before. And those same old words that proved untrue, and left me alone with my tears which the rest of the world was deaf to. It's the same old feeling, but different somehow, allowing me to hope and feel like i feel right now: Like my heart is safe, and this time things will be different, like I may finally find relief  from my inner torment. Should my heart again be broken and my hopes be unfounded, I will return once again to despair unbounded. Please be gentle, for the heart is a fragile thing. And only love can finally give it wings. So here's my heart-- Do with it what you will-- containing all my love, and everything else I feel.

      toni (jim's gf): i love 2 run... when im bing chased by wild animals.  wut an awesome day! first we went 2 lake elkhorn. no geese tho haha. lol but we did c a flying squirrel! then we went and saw "the village". that was a great movie! then he dropped me back at my house and i cleaned up a little, then went 4 a run. and of course, talked jim in2 driving me up 2 safeway 2 buy cat food and talk 2 my boss. haha its all set, i got tuesday off! and jim took me 2 c his and toni's new apartment cuz its right by there. haha im so excited 4 them. i told jim im gonna come visit him every day after work, and hes like "im moving" lol.so then tony came 2 my house and we walked 2 irina's 4 movie night. that was fun lol. we watched "along came polly" and then "resident evil". fun stuff! then we took a nice romantic starlit stroll back 2 my house (haha w/ irina and alex!) but actually we walked up 2 the "black hole" (i dont know y irina calls it that lol). then michelle called me on my cell phone from irina's house 2 ask where irina was cuz she just left w/o telling nebody. lol she would have gotten in lots of trouble if she wasnt such a good liar. i, of course, had no1 2 answer 2 when i got home lol. haha but yea im starting 2 like midnight strolls. haha the dogs need 2 b walked. mayb ill go do that. but first, food. lol ive had so much fun 2day i didnt even think about eating! i havent eaten since 11:30 this morning. well, xcept that one apple slice that tasted like an orange lol. shoot, its jim's b-day 2morrow. well, actually 2day. i still gotta get him somethin lol. and tiffany 2. haha i cant wait 4 her party tuesday! and of course, that race friday, which i would have completely 4gotten about if it werent 4 tony lol. ok, but im goin 4 real this time lol. must find food...

      i am so mad at safeway! the only day i requested off 4 next week was tuesday 4 tiffany's b-day party. well they decided now they're only gonna schedule me 1 day a week. and guess which day they picked 4 next week! these ppl r so unorganized! i refuse 2 work tuesday. i requested it off and im not gonna cancel my plans just cuz they wanna b stupid! haha sry, im just a little angry lol. but racheal came 2 buy a banana, so that made it all better lol. so neway, i had a nice little screaming match over the phone w/ my aunt. it felt good actually. i havent told her wut i was thinkin in a long time. evry time she gets me mad i usually just bite my tongue. even this time i didnt tell her EVERYTHING that was on my mind lol. cuz if i had i really wouldnt b goin out 2morrow. but she was pretty mad. she said something about wanting me 2 communicate more, and that i never talk 2 her and tell her wut im doing and stuff. which is prolly cuz im always home so she can always c wut im doin! and if that were true, i wouldnt have gone 2 her 2day. so instead of appreciating the fact that i was bing honest and--get this--COMMUNICATING-- w/ her, she decides 2 punish me 4 all the times b4 when i didnt communicate. yea pretty stupid logic. but neway after havin it out w/ her i agreed 2 "communicate" w/ her more, wutever that means. but even then she said i was only agreein 2 that now cuz i wanted somethin. i just cant win. but o well, the important thing is that she finally agreed 2 let me go, and actually convinced my uncle 2 let me go. w/ a long list of conditions of course. but its all good. at least im goin...

      dilemma: tony is taking me out 2morrow and im not sure how my aunt and uncle would feel about me driving w/ him. the way i c it, i have 3 choices:  1. call them, tell them the truth and just c wut they say. it may pay 2 just b honest w/ them. even tho it never has b4. and wut if they say no? its not like i can just not go. so id b forced 2 deliberately go bhind their back. and they might bcome suspicious and think i might do that neway, so they might call 2 check in on me. 2. call them, tell them part of the truth but say some1 else is driving. the next-to-most honest decision. i may get away w/ it, but then again i may not. knowing my aunt, she would call tony's parents 2 get the story. 3. dont call them, dont tell them nething, and hope they dont call here lookin 4 me. the most devious plan. and wut if they do call? ill have 2 make up an excuse. then she'll question it and 1 lie will lead 2 a whole bunch of lies. and if they find out i was lying they'll never trust me again.  but even as im writing this i know wut i have 2 do. gosh darnit! y do i always have 2 do the responsible thing? wish me luck!

      what a depressing movie! i just watched "cabin fever" w/ tiffany. everybody DIES! and i mean EVERYBODY! but it was good xcept 4 that lol. tiffany slept over last night after the concert. xcept, 4 some reason her mom had told my aunt that i was sleeping over her house, so my uncle had come home so he could walk the dogs. so he was home when i got back from the concert w/ tiffany. he seemed kinda mad. i think he thought i was bringin tiffany over 4 some wild party or something and not tellin him lol. but really, i was gonna call him. but i think he may have also been mad cuz i hadnt cleaned up jim's mess yet cuz i didnt know he was comin home. i felt kinda bad about that actually. but he didnt say nething about it. i dunno, i can never tell when my uncle's mad. so unlike my aunt! lol. but he's gone now. he went back 2 the campground. but im not alone ne more cuz jim came home, and brought his gf. and im still cleaning up after him! but yea, tiffany slept over last night, and shes sleepin over again 2night. we spent all day 2day workin on my puzzle. ALL day! lol. haha we didnt even stop 2 eat. lol we got a lot of it done tho. so now im just sittin here waitin 4 tony 2 come on, and tiffany is workin on the puzzle. again! lol. o, i got my schedule! i had thought i hadnt gotten it, but really i had and my aunt had already opened it and evrything and had it in her stuff. couldnt bother 2 tell me about it lol. i even asked her about it! but yea, i think im the only one out of all the ppl i know who's happy w/ their schedule. xcept i didnt get SAT prep. but at least i got my alternate. every1 else's is just totally screwed up lol. well im gonna go help tiffany w/ the puzzle till tony comes on.

      i decided 2 record this 4 my later reference. cuz its not always an easy thing 2 remember, and sometimes i just need 2 b reminded.  "But she's very focused and determined.  I was thinking maybe that's how your becoming.  When I read your email about community service and the national honor society I thought "yup, if Sarah wants to do that bad enough, she will "I'm very proud of you Sarah. Keep of the good work.  Your going to go places, Kid.  Love from all of us.  Aunt Jaye"

      ok. my folks r gone, so now i can finally relax lol. lets c, where should i begin? well im starting 2 think jim is just as immature as my aunt and uncle say he is. the only responsibility they left him the whole time we were gone was 2 get the mail since they hired an agency 2 take care of the pets. good thing 2, cuz he couldnt handle just getting the mail ONCE the whole time we were gone! plus the house is a mess, and there's 5-day old pizza on the counter, along with a bunch of other once-edible food substances i cant identify. and of course he ran off 2 his gf's house when he started gettin yelled at. so who's stuck cleaning everything? me, of course! u know, i hate 2 say it, and mayb im wrong, but i think in some ways we'll all b a lot happier once he's out of the house... im goin 2 a concert 2morrow w/ tiffany 4 her 16th b-day. i almost didnt get 2 go, cuz i 4got 2 request that day off work, and i didnt realize it till i called from the airport 2day 2 check my schedule and they said i had 2 work 2morrow. i was ready 2 just call tiffany and tell her i couldnt go cuz walton has already been so nice about coverin 4 me when i needed it, i just couldnt ask him 2 do it again. bsides, i thought it would b almost the most irresponsible thing i could do (aside from 4getting 2 put in 4 the time i mean). but after my aunt's lecture, she suggested i call them and tell them that we're stayin in st. louis 4 another day and ask them 2 find some1 2 cover 4 me. so thats wut i did. so i got the "im very disappointed in u" speech from my aunt and the "im not very happy about this" speech from my boss, but at least im goin. now if i can only get rid of the guilt. im thinking mayb i should have decided 2 just go 2 work. the last thing i need is 2 appear even more irresponsible than im sure they already think i am. and i mean, i deserve it neway 4 4getting 2 put in 4 the time. it only seems fair that i work 2morrow. but no, i had 2 find a way 2 weazle out of it instead of just accepting the consequences... but its 2 late now. so now, about my trip 2 st. louis. im gonna record almost every detail of it, mostly 4 my own reference, cuz it was the most awesome experience ever, and i dont wanna 4get a thing. so this will b a bit long lol. it may get sentimental and philosophical at times, but its all stuff that needs 2 b said.  july 24: i got up at 4 in the morning and left 4 the airport at 5. jim came w/ us so he could drive the van back. and he even gave me a hug b4 he left. i was quite surprised lol. i cant remember the last time he hugged me. the flight was awesome cuz i slept almost the whole way. it was really uncomfy, but i slept lol. so that was a fun flight. but the best part was the view. it was just one continuous layer of white fluffy clouds and it looked like we were riding on them. it was easy 2 imagine that i could just get out and walk on top of them, and they seemed 2 stretch 2 the end of the world. so after we landed we took the shuttle 2 the rental car place, where we met up w/ my grandparents who had gotten there thursday. only 2 find out they didnt have a van 4 us, even tho my aunt reserved one 2 months ago. so she was mad! but of course i had 2 miss all the action cuz they made me stay outside w/ the luggage. but my pepere came out and told me it was gonna b a while so i made myself a nice little bed on the bags and slept some more. well it was finally settled that the rental car place was gonna shuttle us 2 another rental car place. so we did that, got r car, and all was well. but then we got 2 the hotel and r room wasnt ready yet. so we went and took a tour of the budweiser brewery while we were waiting. that was cool even tho beer isnt really my thing lol. but i finally got a new bathing suit (yes, a budweiser one!) my uncle said i couldnt get it cuz then he would b 2 attracted 2 me (eeeeew, incest! lol). and i also got a pin (cuz i have 2 get one from every place i go!) well by the time we came back r room was ready. it was soooooo fancy! i kept feelin like i didnt belong there. so after we got settled me, abi, and memere and pepere went swimming (me in my new bud suit lol). but the lifeguard kept lookin at me and i think he was checkin me out, so i didnt stay long lol. so i hung out in the room 4 a little while, and went 2 bed extremely early cuz i was exhausted lol. but i watched tv 4 a while and fell asleep around 10.  july 25: boring day. all i did was help my aunt set up 4 registration all day, then i helped w/ the kid's registration when it started at 5. but they didnt really need me, so i went out 2 dinner w/ my uncle and abi and timmy and stephanie. jess flew in that afternoon, and we went running in the fitness room later that night. but i only ran 2 miles cuz it was right after dinner and i wasnt planning on running lol.  july 26: this was the first day of the conference, and i helped in the daycare most of the day. but there werent many kids cuz there werent really ne meetings or nething that the kids couldnt go 2. and there were 6 ppl there from the agency my aunt had hired so the ratio of caregivers 2 kids was like 3:1 lol. so i was pretty bored. so after lunch memere and pepere took me and abi out since i really wasnt needed, and we went down 2 the arch and the riverfront. that arch is pretty big lol. but the wait was 2 long 2 go up in it, so we went on a boat ride down the mississippi instead. that was ok but kind of boring. lol i think i have ADD. i tried 2 watch the sights, but i just rested my eyes most of the time. the only thing i found interesting was the arch. we had 2 walk back 2 the hotel cuz memere didnt wanna wait 4 the shuttle. lol so that was a nice long walk. but something every1 should experience at least once: getting lost in downtown st. louis lol. haha but pepere bought me a shirley temple when we got back. good times lol. then i went running in the fitness room (by myself this time, cuz jess had already gone running). but i only ran 3 miles cuz i cant stand running on tread mills. i get so bored. haha must b my ADD again!  july 27: there were a few more kids in the daycare, but still not many. except when the zoo came, all the parents brought their kids in and stayed w/ them, but left right after the zoo left. and thats when me and abi left 2. memere and pepere took us 2 union station and we walked around 4 a little while. when we got back, i went back 2 the daycare room, and i dont know where abi went. but the only kid there was alex. i remembered him from the last conference 2 years ago when he was 3. he has a more severe case of joubert syndrome and he's also blind. at the last conference i layed down on the floor w/ him and rubbed his back 4 like 3 hours and just wondered why... i did the same thing this time. he was 2 years older, and taller, but other than that he was exactly the same. with his thin arms and legs that seemed 2 have no muscles in them, just laying there on the floor rocking himself back and forth, sometimes grunting, just trying 2 find a way 2 cope w/ his darkness. and it occured 2 me as i layed (lied?) there that this was all he would ever b. so 2day i just layed there staring in 2 his empty hazel eyes moving back and forth but never seeing. and i wondered wut he saw there deep inside his own darkness. then he smiled. it was fleeting, and it did nothing 2 light up his dark eyes, but it provided a glimpse in2 his world. but of course he wasnt smiling at nething in this world. then it was gone. and i started thinking. if there is a god, he cant b as merciful as evry1 says he is, or if he is, not as perfect. he either knowingly condemned alex--all those kids--2 darkness and ignorance, or he made a mistake. either way, its impossible 4 me 2 trust in this god. i dont know whether 2 hate him 4 wut he did 2 alex, or 2 pity him 4 having 2 live up 2 all those divine expectations ppl have of him that he can never live up 2. but y am i talkin about god? didnt i stop having nething 2 do w/ him a long time ago? u know, at first i didnt remember alex. but when i saw him and they told me his name it all came back 2 me, and i remembered 2 years ago laying w/ him and i had promised 2 always remember that moment bcuz it was important. then i recalled various other situations and events that i told myself i always wanted 2 remember but have now started slipping away. it kind of depresses me and makes me feel like theres no use in experiencing nething bcuz it just gets lost over the years. thats y im writing evrything down... after i layed down w/ alex i played w/ shanna, who's about 11 and not affected as severely as alex. she cant talk, but she knows how 2 get her point across. and she's so smart. ne1 lookin at her, or ne of these kids, wouldnt think they know nearly as much as they do. like, she knows sign language, but she heard us talking amongst rselves and say we dont know sign language, so she didnt use it w/ us. she just used movements and gestures she knew we could understand. all these kids r so much smarter than ne1 gives them credit 4.  july 28: instead of goin 2 daycare right away, i stayed in the meeting room after breakfast 2 watch a presentation they were doin about genetics, and how the joubert genes r passed down, and their progress in finding the genes that cause the syndrome. it was all really interesting and i actually understood most of it lol. the next part was prenatal diagnosis. i watched a little bit of that but abi wanted me 2 go 2 daycare w/ her. but thats ok. i kinda started 2 lose interest there neway. so i took abi 2 the daycare and we watched some african storytelling thing the zoo was putting on. then abi went w/ my uncle 2 pick up lunch, so i was finally free lol. 4 a little while neway. so while they were gone, jess made me keep her company while she travelled around the whole hotel in search of a single stamp lol. haha she likes dragging me around on her little errands. but its cool, i like hanging out w/ her. haha on the elevator she told me about her mad crush on one of my aunt's researchers, named Ellis. then, after we finally got a stamp we went back 2 jess's room so she could decide wut she was gonna wear that night. then we went back 2 my room and had lunch. then i had 2 go set up the arts and crafts 4 the kids. that was really unorganized cuz there were only a couple kids, and evry1 just kinda did wut they wanted. but i had fun helping them. its interesting 2 c all the different skill levels of the kids. so after that i hung out and played w/ them 4 a while b4 going 2 change 4 dinner. i was lookin 4ward 2 the ceremony afterward cuz there was a teen/adult panel where the teens and adults w/ joubert syndrome get up and talk about wut their life is like. then after that was the bereavement ceremony 4 all the kids w/ joubert syndrome who have died. but after dinner erin's mom asked me if i would babysit cuz erin wanted 2 go 2 bed. i wasnt 2 happy about it but i went. my uncle was taping the whole thing neway. so when i got up 2 the room erin was already asleep so all i did was watch tv all evening. when her mom came back she tried 2 pay me but i wouldnt take the money. i wasnt 2 happy about missing the ceremony but she had seemed desperate 4 a babysitter and i was glad 2 help her out.  july 29: i hung out in the daycare all morning, and sat w/ alex 2 watch the presentation the aquarium was putting on. i helped him touch all the animals  as the lady brought them around. he really liked the snake. he wouldnt stop rubbing his hand over it, and kept reaching 4 it after she moved on w/ it. after the aquarium left i went 4 a run. i took abi w/ me cuz she was bored and she had become my shadow. even tho kids rnt supposed 2 b in the fitness room, but o well. she ran on the tread mill a little, but never really broke a sweat cuz she duznt understand the meaning of exercise lol. but even tho i had her, i still managed 2 get in a decent run, cuz she was pretty patient. so i ran 5 miles at a pretty fast pace. haha, getting better w/ the tread mill. but that was only cuz i picked the right one, and i got a view of the arch lol. then we stayed at the daycare till it was time 2 change 4 dinner. there were no ceremonies or nething after dinner, so i went swimming w/ memere while abi swam w/ her friend. after that i had 2 babysit jimmy and jacob, who r 12 and 13. just like w/ all the other kids, i was amazed at how smart they r. especially jimmy. they cant really talk, and they have 2 scoot around on their butts cuz they cant walk. jimmy has an x-box, and is really good at it. lol he kept beating me at star wars and i was actually trying! i asked him 2 show me how 2 play and he pointed 2 the buttons and did hand gestures 2 show me wut all the buttons did. but jacob isnt really at the same level as jimmy mentally, so he couldnt play. he was just watchin tv while we played. but i kept lookin over at him and i could c he was becoming really agitated 4 some reason. then he just started screaming and crying. i had no idea wut was wrong or wut i should do. i picked him up and brought him in2 the bedroom and put him on the bed thinking mayb a change of scenary would help. it didnt. so i brought him back in2 the other room and put him on the floor and just tried 2 calm him down. i layed him in the middle of the floor away from everything so he wouldnt hurt himself. but he had already opened up an old scab in his forehead. and he kept biting his hand and actually drew blood. but i guess i put him 2 close 2 jimmy cuz jacob reached up and pulled his hair. so yea, i had 2 12 and 13-yearold boys, both screaming, and me not knowing wut 2 do. but jimmy was a lot easier 2 console than jacob. so after i calmed him down, i went back 2 jacob. he had been screaming 4 almost a half hour, and it was 11:00 at night. so i called their parents and told them wut was going on. they said they were on they're way back but were stuck in traffic and would b there as soon as possible. well i eventually calmed him down b4 they got back by reading him a story. should have thought of it sooner lol. so their parents came back, paid me (i figured i had earned it this time lol), then i left.  july 30: this was the last day of the conference. i was in the daycare most of the day. a magician came 4 the kids that afternoon, and there was an ice cream social and stuff. but the best part was the closing ceremony that night. along w/ dinner, there was a silent auction. i bidded on a skateboard and a pack of 4 2-sided beatles puzzles. lol im not really in 2 the beatles, but hey, they were puzzles. and bsides, i never tried a 2-sided one b4. but i didnt win it neway. thats only cuz i had 2 leave early 2 put erin 2 bed and sit w/ her again. i asked memere 2 keep an eye on it 4 me, but she didnt do a very good job lol. i won the skateboard tho. but this time i REALLY wasnt happy about bing asked 2 babysit. i thought it was really inconsiderate 2 ask me 2 miss the closing ceremony like that. but the part of it that i didnt miss was fun. my aunt gave a big long closing speech, most of which she cried thru lol. and the family of one of the kids who had died was there, and they put out their album that they had made of her. her name was analee and she was only 4 years old. i remember my aunt goin 2 the funeral and the pictures she had brought back w/ her and how i had cried when my aunt told me all those stories about her. i almost cried again as i stood there looking at that album. all the pictures of her, the poem her parents had wrote, and various stories her brothers had written about her, written with a child's understanding and acceptance, and radiating simplicity. i would have cried if i wasnt around all those ppl. i guess its a good thing i didnt go 2 the bereavement ceremony, cuz i would have balled like a baby! there rnt many things that really make me cry, but i just cant handle death.  july 31: this was the first real day of my "vacation". i slept till 9, and by the time i got up my grandparents were just finishing loading up their truck, and they left around 10. they were driving back 2 maryland 2 drop off some stuff from the conference, then driving back 2 massachusetts. bill and mary jane had come in thursday, and they came over along w/ one of my aunt's board members erik, and they just sat down and talked 4 a while. then we left w/ bill and mary jane and went 2 grant's farm. that is, after we spent like an hour saying goodbye 2 every1 from the conference. grant's farm was ok. but we didnt get 2 stay long cuz both abi and stephanie started throwing fits. so my aunt was mad 4 like the rest of the day, and if i tried 2 talk, even if i was talkin 2 bill, i'd get yelled at. so i just decided 2 stop talking. it was like 4:30 by the time we got back 2 the hotel, and i watched tv 4 a little while, then went running. i was planning on doin 6 miles, but i only did 5 cuz of time and cuz i got bored lol. then my aunt and uncle went out w/ bill and mary jane and i had 2 watch the kids. after dinner we went swimming, and i even managed 2 get stephanie in the pool (shes autistic and never wants 2 do nething). so that cleared me of ne wrong i may have previously done that day in my aunt's eyes.  august 1: we went 2 nascar speedpark, which is like a go-cart and arcade place. bill and mary jane came w/ us. it was so fun! bill kept tryin 2 run me off the track when we were riding the go-carts. lol i got him back tho. but not on purpose. c, he was comin up next 2 me on the corner and the kind of car i had wasnt very good at takin sharp turns lol. then timmy's hat flew off and every1 was runnin over it lol. so yea that was fun. they also had a climbing wall, but they wouldnt let me do it cuz i wasnt wearing sneakers. stupid ppl lol. abi wanted 2 do it, but she chickened out while they were puttin the harness on. after we left, we went out 2 dinner at the spaghetti factory. the best food i've ever had! when we got back 2 the hotel we ordered "mean girls" from the hotel and watched it. it was ok but i didnt think it was very original. then i watched "malibu's most wanted" on HBO after evry1 went 2 sleep. funniest movie ever!!  august 2: we finally went 2 the arch, the only thing i'd been lookin 4ward 2 the whole trip lol!. we went early in the morning 2 beat the crowd, so there was no wait. it was so much fun! abi and stephanie even went up. i thought i was gonna get claustrophobic in those little capsules but i didnt. we had 2 get in these little capsules that seat 5 ppl and it brought us all the way 2 the top, then we got out and looked out the windows. its 630 feet high! it was so fun. its like a triangle so the windows on the wall r tilted and u can lean over so its almost like ur lying down and look down. it felt kind of like doin the skycoaster at 6 flags, only much higher lol. and i started 2 realize how scary it might b 2 actually go skydiving. but its still somethin i definitely wanna do. it was so much fun! we saw r hotel, the baseball stadium, the football stadium, and even a person doin sit-ups on the grass under us lol. after we came down we went in the museum, then the gift shop, where i finally got my puzzle lol. i plan 2 start it as soon as im done the one im workin on now. but this one is only 500 pieces, not quite as frustrating lol. then we went 2 union station. we walked around 4 a little while and had lunch at hooters. then we went 2 the city museum, which really isnt a museum at all lol. its like a big playground. a HUGE playgraound! its like 4 stories high, inside and outside. the outside is all like construction equipment and metal an wires 4 the kids 2 climb on, and its so high up! there was also a huge ball pit that was full of those big inflatable balls instead of the little plastic ones. my uncle even took stephanie in there. but we almost couldnt get her out lol.then the inside is like all trees and caves and stuff 2 climb in. and they also had an art room, a restaurant, and a train ride 4 the little kids. haha i had so much fun! lol i was getting in touch w/ my inner child. man, i wish i could have done somethin like that when i was little. haha but thats ok, cuz i still got 2 do it. i might have made a fool of myself, but i did it lol. but not really, cuz i only look like im like 12 so its all good lol. then we went out 4 dinner, then went back 2 the hotel and went swimming 4 a little while. after that we ordered "home on the range" and watched that. i didnt really like the movie itself, but the soundtrack was great! (lol tim mcgraw).  august 3: and 2day wasnt 2 exciting. we slept in, packed up, then drove 2 the airport. r flight left at 1:30, and we landed at 3:30, which was really 4:30 since we had lost an hour somewhere over the course of the flight (im still confused about that! lol). then we came home and unpacked. then i hugged my computer! lol not really but i was glad 2 c it again. i talked 2 irina 4 a little while while i was waitin 4 my folks 2 leave lol. well they finally left, and now im just sitting here talkin 2 irina agian (even tho there's some1 i'd much rather b talkin 2) and wondering how in the world it could possibly b 11:30 at night. i guess this time change is really getting 2 me lol. wait a minute, i started writing this thing at 7:30. wow, yea i definitely have no life lol. but im done now. and tony still isnt on. i was hopin 2 kill some time. lol i guess i managed 2 do that, but obviously not enuff. mayb ill go get some dinner (the best part of bing home alone: eating dinner at 11 pm :-) but i just realized that they left me no food lol. again! at least they left toilet paper this time, but the only thing in the fridge is the chocolate milk and philly cheese steaks my bro bought while we were gone. hmm think that will last 5 days? lol. but i know as soon as i leave tony's gonna come on cuz thats just my luck. haha o well.
