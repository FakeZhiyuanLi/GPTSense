      When I woke up this morning, it was in a cold sweat...like normal. I've been forgetting little things alot lately. For instance, when I was going to work this morning I couldn't remember where I put my keys. I must have searched for 20 minutes before I realized they were hanging on the keyrack beside the door. I've been getting more aggitated...more jumpy.    Finally I get to finish this entry. Some asshole intern spilled coffee all over my shit and now I'm soaked..and pissed. Why does it always end up like this? Why is it that I'm always messed with? Why the hell won't PEOPLE JUST LET ME BE? DID I DO ANYTHING TO ANYBODY ELSE TO DESERVE THIS?

      I've been getting headaches lately. Not the usual head-splitting ones...a mild type. In fact, I don't even know if its a headache, I just say it is because I know no other way to describe it. Even two weeks after the incident I've still been having the dreams. The images of the event haunt my sleep. It's hard to even gather the energy to go back to work anymore. At least...to go back to that place.   I never thought something like that could ever happen. It's a fusion reactor, not a nuclear bomb. Ten seconds of time has turned into weeks. I fear it may be getting worse. My colleagues insist I get medical attention, but I know better. No doctors can help me now. I fear what may come ahead, for something of this magnitude has never occured before...or ever will again.

      w00h00!  Elizabeth is out of the picture...and me and Micah are in. The new director is really cool...and I think he's going to lead us to great things. :-D  Me and Micah started our program today...I say our program because we did it last year. We want to mix fun with learning without yelling ;-D  I think we are going to do it quite well.   I hope Micah went home and wrote some warmups last night...cuz...well...haha Mine kinda sucks. I wrote one though.   Also...Last year we did alot of stuff with playing songs for the crowd for warmups....This year will hopefully be the same.   We already are working on "Yeah" from Usher...and some old favorites will return as well.   Its gonna be cool :-)  Only problem is... :-/ The rest of the band won't ever get to see them.

      Well if life hasn't been hell under Stout then I don't know what is. Stout is our new band director, and with him comes a new array of Nazi-like techniques and punishments. Now...I'm in pit..which means everybody says i can't complain cause I'm not out marching...or not marching...depending on if they have to stand at attention for 10 minutes or not.  Anyway...The point being...We are all in this for the long run...and I don't like to see my fellow band mates to suffer... SO  I decided to be nice yesterday and help out the trumpets by getting them towels and exchanging them. Mr. Stout didn't like this idea because i guess he wants everybody to suffer...(i had nothing to do on the sidelines anyway....) so he tells me "Go away Mitch...You're starting to get on my nerves."  Haha..I was sooo close to saying..."I'M getting on YOUR nerves? I QUIT" and walking off the field...But i felt bad for the other band members so I was pushing through for them...Plus I exchanged towels whether he likes it or not. Then I helped serve water....which sacrificed my water break but hey...As long as I can help the band.  In fact...I'm thinking of quitting band and just helping the band boosters. I dunno... Alot of people don't want me to quit...and I don't know why...I mean I don't want to be part of a band that has a director that cares so little about his band. Stout just wants to leave his mark on the Decatur High Band because he doesn't yet have tenure...Doesn't care about the band.  My brother isn't coming to Band Camp today because he is soo burned that his face is puffed up bigger than Mr. Stout's ego. The bass drum reflects the sun right into his face and he can barely move....So mom said he can't go...no matter what Stout says. So yea....  Pull through everybody. Let's pull through this together.  Cause you know if one person cracks and quit...then everybody else is gonna crack and quit...the Tension is THAT high.  I'm so close....
