      EL papers were such a nightmare....   My paper one was... urgh. I failed my part one badly, with a score of 12... Ouch! But i managed to savage the situation by having 20 for report writing.. Heng passed!  I was only given 2 to 3 secs to glance at my marks and to see whether it was correct, so i didnt get to see my mistakes. Mw might want a redress, i heard.  As everyone were thinking of whether MW came today, i turned around and saw her right at the top of the lecture hall. We were all asked to go to comp lab.  I was sitting at my favourite spot in the Computer Lab 4 (with Made wasnt a choice) and was there with my paws on the table, waiting for my paper.  I wasnt very happy, i was shivering. Because it was cold.. Brrr.. When MW came to the part where she was going to talk about the chalet, SY and i armed ourselves; i took the mouse and aimed, she took her calculator. Blah, blah, blah... It turned out that MW didnt really say anything about it. Maybe because i stopped her?  As expected, i knew FG would win most of the catergories.. CA1 and EL P1... I was rather surprised later.. (*looks at SY from the corner of my eyes* I'm no sore loser either, you cant spite me!) I was observing MW all the while, and her eyes grew big when she saw the marks.  I told my mom the news when i got home, she was delighted. Oh well, it seems that i'm going shopping soon!

      I thought i should give Old Chang Kee's curry puff a try, seeing that Aaronick has it for lunch. I thought it was good, so here's a few comments on it.  The filling's good, there's egg, unlike the usual stuff you have in curry puffs. There's taste- tinge of spice...  BUT, i hate the "skin" (what do u call it?) It's too flaky, too oily, the sides are too hard, and after a few mouthfuls it was really "ni4".  On the overall, i thought the one sold at Eunos is better. It's really Curry puff, cos the ones my mom bought had whole half eggs in it, and had chunks of chicken. The curry was fresh and good too; it wasnt too flowly nor like the old chang kee's. Old Chang Kee's curry in the curry puff seem rather old and starchy. Too potato-ish.  That's all i have to say....... Ol' Chunky's curry puff isnt that good as compared. No offence meant, okay?

      Mr Soon said that he sees students coming to school in the morn with their uniform tucked out. Well, then they go home with the uniform out. Disgracing the school all the way from home to school and back.  However, this way, displacement is ZERO. So does it really matter?  Ironically, i do not like students improperly dressed. But i do pity the boys, cos their shirts are rather short for their lengthy body. The uniform companies are pretty clever too- they print their advertisments on the uniform itself. I do feel unhappy about our school students, but i shant air my views here.

      "BARD - verb. Past tense of the infinitive 'to borrow.' Usage: 'My brother bard my pickup truck.'"  urlLink [Source]   That is extreme for a learner, but I have in the past taught my students the phonetic way of saying a word, while trying to get them to forget the way it's written. That's because people who have difficulties hearing right resort to the written word, and pronounce it the way they would have in their mother tongue. Thus beard, here in France, would sound more like /bi: rd/. Nobody has bard this technique from me, yet. You can bar it if you'd like.   This is interesting... From  urlLink On English . I like this site a lot man, this is good.

      MW intended to treat JT together with Mdm Rose for chalet. Apparently someone foiled the plans.. *grumble, looks at SY*  Me: When would you like us to help you with your table? I mean, help you with your shift. Btw, what about the English Premiere Cup?  MW: Dont worry about the shift. Probably next term. That teacher's foot is still injured. I've changed the Cup mechanics with FG out of the picture in the second half of the year. Btw...  Me: You mean we'll be competing with another class?  MW: I'll not take another English class next term so the competition will be among students within 3JT.  Me: What about the chalet?  MW: I'm sharing cost with Ros so whole class enjoys challet (sp mistake) but prize for one from me.  Me: There's always bound to be people unhappy about this.  MW: Why?  Me: Someone from FG beside me is complaining already. (at this pt in time, SY decides to intervene.)  SY to MW: (complains)  MW to me: Well, new Malay teacher will have to decide on another incentive program.  Me: MALAY TEACHER?!?!?!?! Btw, Ms Soh called me Jasmine again.  MW to me: Haha! Maybe she always wanted that name. Dont worry. You dont look like one.  Me: I'm not worried, i'm not meant to be in green tea anyway. She says i look like one of her students.  MW to SY: (something abt malay teacher teaching them.)  SY to MW: (something abt studying hard for Mid-yr so that they can clinche the chalet.)  MW to SY: (says FG may join JT chalet.)  SY to MW: Okay...  Me to Mw using SY phone (running all over the room running away from SY): no k. eunice here.  Me to MW using my phone: Arhhhhhhhhh!!!!!! Ok, i'm one selfish git.  MW to me and SY: Btw its somewhere near christmas so its going to be fun.  Me: How big is the chalet?  MW: I'll try to get the larger ones. Heard that the ones in Changi are larger than those in loyang.  Me: SY says that the ones at Changi has nothing but the sea.  Up till now, there is no more news from MW.  P.S. I was watching tv when this guy said that when u see ghost ur faeces will be green. Pretty true, cos.... (Bio students fill the blank pls.) I rem is something in ur body released when u r in great fright, if i'm not wrong...

      Well, i always had a *mindset* (reminds me of Mr TLT!) that teachers, esp the English speaking ones would type in full sentences.. But i was proven wrong.  But for a teacher who speaks English That fluently, i was rather surprised upon hearing her speak in Mandarin. I tell you it was better then i have thought. So, who is she, u may think.  Mrs Eileen Yeo! I was surprised when i recieved her SMS. Not because she sent me an SMS, but it was full of incomplete words and weirdly constructed sentences! This one i received this afternoon says, "4 wat?". At least shd be "What for".   Nvm, but i'm so glad that i've finally made a big improvement at my A math.  My interest had turned from E math to A math, mainly because of the teacher.   For me, the learning style is not really KVA, AVK, VAK, etc, but more of who i'm willing to listen to. The last time was Ms Wong RW.. Ms Yeo WQ.. It seems that i only like to listen to young teachers, like what MW said. Get a young and beautiful lady to teach "them" to captivate "them". This way then they'll listen..  My class is almost the same, and we gave the teachers such a hard term, until recently we turned for the better. Mdm rose used to tell us this almost every two days: Dont choose who you want to listen to and who you do not. I found this rather hard to convince, cos of MR ZOU. dont u agree?

      Someone's getting more destestable lately. No names will be mentioned, but it definitely isnt madeline, if you were thinking of her! She's a nice person actually, so to all FG people no matter you are the mastermind, pawn or victim of the prank, stop all the nonsense. Esp SOME people. Maybe one only.  Had our SS paper today, it was HORRIBLE. Although i knew how to do only Question 3a, i had already anticipated that NI would come out for Question 1. Stupid me. I knew Sinn Fein would come out, but i had no way of finding out who the.... it is. It wasnt important anyway.  Well, i knew causes of conflict would surely come out. The only problem was i didnt know which, SL or NI would come out. Until.... I saw MW at the canteen today. I intended to ask her for my History notes, but Daryl and i just happened to meet her at the canteen. Well, she didnt have the notes with her, of course. But Daryl and I have already sat down beside her, each on one side.   So MW started asking questions such as "What are the causes of conflict in SL"? Then i was listing out all the points in a messy order, and she pointed out that the points shd be according to importance. I listed them out again, and she said, "Right, rem this. Evaluating the source, try to detect the tone......"  After she was done with talking to us abt the similarities between LTTE, IRA, Sinn Fein and Tamil United Liberation Front (LTTE and IRA are both militant groups while Sinn Fein and TULF are both political groups), she shooed us off cos there was another teacher appraoching. In fact, it was mw's dear friend, Mr Davamoni, or Lord Albert.  After leaving the canteen, then both daryl and i realized what mw had just done. We snatched the SL and NI notes to read.... Blah, and thats whay i ended up writing one and a half page for 3a.

      The number of ulcers in my mouth has reduced. From four to three. You know why? "In all my adult life, i believed in merger."  Yup, because one of them has merged with another one. Sighs, its hurting so much that its spoiling my appetite. I cant drink, cant talk, cant laugh, cant eat. Grouch.  Ok, lets not talk about NAFA. Its spoiling my mood too- mr khoo says that "they" may be considering females born 1989 and above to be enlisted for NS.  I got my Short Story back today! Oh boy, i was so excited when i got it back. It was full of red marks, as in, full of corrections by MW, and i thought i would get my usual lousy grade. As in... the range between 50 to 60, but i was surprised!  What was clipped to the back of my story was this photocopied piece about Shrek 2. And one of the paper enclosed was this quiz "How well do you know about your fairy tales?", and the first question was:   Which toy wants to become a real boy? 1. Justin Timberlake 2. Aaron Carter 3. Pinochio 4. (something)  Interesting.... Aaron Carter.... TOY???  Oh, the title of my story was "Wizard of Ogre". That was why mw gave me the Shrek stuff. Cos he was an ogre too. ARGH! Look at the time! I was looking at the SL package tour just now. It was rather irrevelant to what we need for the exams, it gives info on SL up to 2004, but i dont think its going to be tested anyway. So, i guess i'll have to scoot off to bed now.  Nite!

      After one whole entry of mw, now a bit of my own stuff.  Currently, i'm having about 4 to 5 ulcers in my mouth. OUCH. Actually there are 2 at the lower lip and the ones on the upper lip were caused by my mum. How so, you may ask.  On thursday night, as i didnt pay enough attention to my mom's groans, she threw my hole puncher on the table at me. Luckily (or unluckily), i was sitting on a chair with a backing. I dont usually sit on those while using the computer, i usually sit on stools (not the toilet seat!). So the hole puncher hit the chair. You could imagine, i was sitting on those Ikea chairs which only has around 15cm of backing.....   If i was sitting on my normal stool, what could have happened? Then subsequently she threw a few more books at me, so it hit my upper lip and the insides collided with my teeth... Ouch...The formation of a few more ulcers!  Btw, Finn's blog has finally been updated! I cannot really figure out the tiny details in that entry, but interesting.  urlLink Now GO!

      Unfortunate things happen everyday, and it did. It happened on MW. (this isnt on mwfc for this is from unrealiable source.)  Apparently, there was this loud mouthed councillor from 3IT called Slyvia (or however u spell that name) who was talking bad literally in front of mw. Of course, she didnt know that mw was behind her. And she mentioned something about mwfc. Something bad, definitely. Mw heard what she said, and of course she was not happy. (This slyvia... I've talked to her once, and that once had already told me what kind of a person she was... She was insulting mw infront of me... I walked away. What a GIT!)  Well, then something else happened that aggravated the matter. Last friday my class was suppose to sit in 3HM for history after school. Unfortunately, my class did not cooperate. We had to bring our chairs down, and Chiaw Sang DID. In fact, he pushed the furniture off the staircase. So the chairs and tables (yes, tables!) was bouncing off the steps. Made such a din! I was in the classroom at that time, trying to keep my concentration on the lesson. But none of us could.   mw did nothing to stop chiaw sang. She called us to concentrate on history instead of trying to figure out what was happening outside. 3HM was such a quiet class. I'm starting to HATE my class. Because of those FEW ppl, teachers are unable to finish teaching. They are always so noisy.   Something happened between Friday and today that made Chiaw Sang see mw. I suspect mdm rose heard of it and had chiaw sang to apologize. However, chiaw sang refused. "What wrong did i do?" That was his question. So mw told him not to say it if he was insincere. Ahhh... Bad day for mw.   However, she told 3IT today that the only inspiration that moved her to walk outside is the cha sao bao, because the cha sao bao in our school *ahem*s. Rather true lah huh.

      When i check my mail, i would automatically scan the list in the junk mail folder and i've spotted this: Delivery Status Notification (Failure) from Hotmail itself!  How could Hotmail have filtered their own emails? However, that's a GOOD thing. I dont have to read the thrash they send me.

      Yesterday when i was chatting with my best friend Joanna she told me that her exams are over. Argh, its rather true. Everyone has their exams already while we, are still in school trying to cover the syllabus. Rather stupid.  Once i was sitting in the library one nice sunny afternoon studying until a bunch of idiots spoilt it. I sort of heard what they said, "Exams over liao, this one (dunno what) fail also never mind one lah..."   I gave them one big hard stare and finally one of them caught it and hushed them. They were, apparently, quarelling over what time their group mate should go home. While i, was trying to concentrate on my A math, and there they were quarreling over some stupid matters.  I told Joanna that I'm having an exam and so I wouldnt see her today. And she asked me whether my school is torturing us. Well, i shd say...... Not really. Rather lax rules with soft hearted teachers.  But not MW. She's going to give all the people who didnt hand up their newspaper report. Some insists that they dont do cause they think that MW wont give over 20 people in the class zero. But they are WRONG. I believe MW WILL.  Today Chiaw Sang came late for the paper. MW was invigilating next door and Mdm Yang didnt really know what to do with him. Mw came out to take a look and told Chiaw Sang to take his paper at the General Office. She didnt look happy. At all. Nevertheless, at the start of the year i have already felt that MW was rather tired of my class. Homework not handed up and improper behaviour, and Zhi yin and i suspected and believed that she complained to Mdm Rose abt my class this morn. I would have lip read MW if i could, but i just wasnt at the ideal place. Oh well, i think i'll keep out of mischeive for a while.

Maybe I shouldnt have bothered.  Well, i changed the ugly font to Lucida Sans too, something much better looking. I'm trying to brainstorm for names of this new site; cant possibly use Spookyowner all the time right?  Gimme some ideas please, Thanks!

      This morn while i was on the way to school in HahazZ's car, i was looking at Mr Tan's dashboard. (Mr Tan= SY's father)  I looked at the accelerator and I was amazed that he was travelling under the speed limit- 89km/h. Just as i was feeling safe, i saw the needle move. 90..... 100.... 105..... 110.... Then i got bored, as that was his normal speed. I was thinking, wouldnt it use a lot more fuel when the car has small wheels?  Just then, i saw a car just right beside with much bigger wheels. It was a CAR. It was running at about the same speed, and i was thinking, maybe that car uses less petrol as it needs less horse force (ma3 li4).   Sometimes i think of weird stuff isnt it?  So if anyone decides to buy a car, get a car with bigger wheels.

      The Passport bug was found by Muhammad Faisal Rauf Danka, a freelance computer security consultant.   Some of the Passport accounts owned by Mr Danka and his friends had been hijacked.   In discovering how this was done, he found the website that gives privileged access to personal accounts and lets passwords be reset.   "It was so simple to do it. It shouldn't have been so simple," said Mr Danka, "Anyone could have done this."   Reportedly Mr Danka sent 10 messages to Microsoft detailing the vulnerability but got no response.   Microsoft only reacted when information about the flaw was posted online.  The flaw has left 200 million Passport accounts vulnerable for the last seven months. The website giving access to the accounts has now been shut down.   The security lapse is embarrassing for Microsoft which is trying to shed its image of a software maker with a lax attitude to security.    I hope they remain with this image! Idiots! People send letters to tell them their flaws, but they refuse to take action, thinking only a few people know about it. Ungrateful!

      The Rose has gone, and here comes Charmaine.  Disgust. I havent bought my Sec 4 Geog TB yet. Knowing her, dont know what she'll be saying tomorrow when she discovers the whole class without a Sec 4 Geog TB. I conveniently forget to remind the class about buying the new TB. Partly beause CS was the one who called me to do it.  Saw her with her (future) husband at NTUC today. Examing those poor boxes of butter. I distinctingly saw this woman that looked so much like her. Because there were a lot of ppl at that section, i had no way across. From top to foot, she looked just like Ms Gan from the back. And it was her. Could see those fat cheeks of hers. Eating Old Chang Kee curry puff. No wonder as fat as ever.  Had a glance at her (future) husband, and i thought he was just about as tall and as lean as Pak Nian. Ok. Maybe he's just skinnier than pn.

      Went to JB yesterday and because it was the last day of the hols it was totally caotic at the immigrations.   Just as when my bag passed the scanners, my sis smsed me and that made the officer check my bag more carefully. (Esther... *wink*) Phew. Nothing.  There was so much people that i could feel the person's curves pressing on my back. Malaysia should seriously do something about their immigration officers man. They simply take their own sweet time doing their work.  I wished the immigrations wld go by identification of the iris, at least its faster. Much much much faster than letting them do a scan on the passport.  However, i doubt that'll happen. Look at Malaysia, still stuck with stamping our passports with all these red triangles and blue squares. Bleh.

      I was in the MRT on the way home yesterday and overheard the conversation between a five year old boy and his mother about his two year old sister.  The mother was calling her daughter 'Sweetie Pie'. Son: You cannot call her Sweetie Pie! Becasue there's only apple pie, ....... coconut pie.  Mother: Then can i call her 'Sweetie'?  Son: No! No, you can only call her 'Mei Mei'.  Mother: Do you know what's Sweetie Pie a not?  Son: No..  Mother: Sweetie pie means she's my baby, i can eat her.  Son: No! You cannot eat her! I'll bite you! (The son went on to bite his mother's arm.)  My sister and I broke out in silent fit of giggles...

      Qi Hui has suggested me to throw my computer out of the window. Faster and more convenient. But I wont. I'd like to listen to the computer's last signs of agony before it dies.  The prob is, Qi hui added me like 30 mins ago. Liwen and SY claims she's online. I said she's not. Nigel said she's offline too. After thirty mins, when Qi hui finally "signed in", SY's offline and Liwen couldnt see her online too.  But.... Liwen claims that Qihui's online. While Pak Nian claims that both are offline, just like what i'm experiencing now. Now Liwen claims that Pak Nian's offline. I hate MSN.

      Is this Compaq's or Microsoft's fault?  My mouse disconnects itself (virtually) from the computer every few minutes. Makes browsing difficult, esp typing this.  Maybe it's plainly my sis's fault for not letting the comp sleep last night and left it on till this evening. I let my mom have a few rounds (aaronick- *wink*) on the computer before i called her to switch it off. It was okay when i turned it on later in the night, until i made my previous entry. It just refuses to insert my fullstops and commas and everything else that's in the 'lower key'. The 'upper keys' appear by themselves without me pressing SHIFT.   I was totally pissed off.. There was no way to insert my commas and fullstops.. Even numbers.. It even defied my direct order to  RESTART... (reminds me of the magic of house elves, though.)  My scroll thingy on the mouse became the "back" button. In an attempt to scroll up, i ended up a few pages before. Stupid. My sis claimed i bang the mouse too much. In actually fact, i've been fairly gentle with this tofu-made computer.  Maybe because i've proven myself much less harsh on the computer, it has decided to stop disconnecting the mouse. Wrong.  My conclusion- neither's at fault (for the mouse prob) for I guess the connector's spoilt or what. Broken connectors or what. As for the weird keyboard, i've encounted this before but Microsoft did not appear the "send error report". So might be plainly my computer or Compaq's substandard computers.   Ok. Compaq's not that bad lah.. At least its better than the other computers that i've heard of... BUT it cannot beat a Mac! Sighs....

      Talking of chilli crab, it brings me back to last Monday....   Went ice skating last Monday and was determined not to wet my pants this time. The Jurong East ice skating ring was small. The kids inside were horrible.  There had these little metal things to aid kids in ice skating, so that they wont fall. But some of these kids know how to skate well. Two of which each took one and charged around the ring with the thingy. All of us were suppose to skate in anti-clockwise dircetion but the two wild boars rammed around the place in the opposite direction like charging bulls.   Twice i was nearly knocked down. When they were 5 metres away from me, i gave them a glare and they quickly turn away or stop in time before they knock me down. Being a wobbly skater myself, i was afraid of falling for  1. i wld wet myself, 2. i dont want bruises in my butt.  You havent heard the worst. They can actually lift the whole thing and fling it in the other direction, having the fact that the two sharp protruding metal sticks would hit someone. Adults use them too. Those glued together couples have to be stuck together so the both wld use one.  The metal thingy is like only up to my knees... hello... stupid people....   But my spirits were lifted after my daddy's friend offered to have chilli crab dinner at his place. I was the only kid there, surrounded by 8 adults. My sister who accompanied me at ice skating, left and i was left in the care of the big uncle. Together with his wife and two other friends, we went to shop for crabs, prawns, buns (no rice for dinner) and a few bag of chips. Lychee too!   I ate till my tummy was full.. Bulged out like SY's... It was so delicious... Too delicious... Intended to stay for durian, but soon my mom's call came. Holding the phone one foot away from my ear, i could still hear her saying "u think u staying next door arh? COME BACK NOW!"  Right. I had to go. I stayed for 15 mins to rest my poor stomach. Soon, i had to set off for a tideous trip from Commonwealth back home. Big uncle brought me to the MRT station as the roads were dark and lonely... Finished The Hobbit in the train... 45 min with my butt stuck on the MRT seat was surely an uneasy thing to do.. Had.to.fidgit.. Cannot.sit.still...

      I was totally disgusted by how info on my blog is all over the net.. For me, i never really disclosed my personal info to untrustable sources. Indeed.  Recently looking around trying to see the originality of my nick "Spookyowner" and indeed all search results yield were related to my blog, somehow. Came across Blogshares.   I'm very interested at how they play with this Blogshare.. Do they play with real money? I'd love to have a hand at these 'investments'. What will happen if the value of my blog rises? Do they earn money? Or just earn some kind of points (like Neopets)?  Of course, i'm not interested at engaging myself with such senseless and time wasting things. I have much better things to do with my free time.  Havent finish holiday homeowrk! Sighs....

      Right. I have moved. The old site wont appear any of the new entries. Recently, there's been mo ming qi miao 11 year olds holding grudges with me, dunno why.. Idiotic disgusting gits.  Here's one email from Madeline's sister, Jolene:  'hello' mrs silly grouch.... so... that time u muz hav received my msg? now... i would like to take my e-mail back!!! now that i went to visit elizabeth's blog, i know how evil n nasty u r!!! did i make u angry b4? no... did i hit u? scold u? no... y ? i wonder y god made such an evil person like you... i'm so 'sorry' but i have 2 tell u that u r not welcomed into my HOUSE!!! 4 ur info, i always go n visit elizabeth's blog n there is no way that i cannot c ur conversation that time idiot.....  Right. How many of you understand what she was trying to say?  1. 'Take her email back'? She means blocking me in her MSN list? Oh goody!  2. i'm not that stupid not to know that she knew i got the new blog addy thru Elizabeth.   3. Why am i nasty and evil? If I am in her eyes and if that makes her distant from me, all the better!  4. Why does Elizabeth's blog show her that i'm nasty and evil?  5. There's no way i'm going to madeline's house ever again, unless they want me to give their cat shitting lessons.  6. what msg have i recieved?  7. why am i MRS?  8. what makes me silly?  Evidently, her email makes no sense at all. But i replied in a nice and civilised manner 'trying' to negotiate, but with hidden agenda trying to tell her how crass her email looks.  Yup, learnt a new word- Crass!

      Finally started on some work. Did some A math assesment and now went on to do my second newspaper article. And i saw sometimes how the journalists make silly mistakes. [ urlLink source ]  "Tokyo and London most expensive cities" to me it seems that the city itself is expensive.  "Four of the world's 10  costliest  cities are in Asia, with Tokyo being the most expensive city globally." How interesting. Costliest. Encarta and Dictionary.com both gave me the meanings of "costly".   Shouldnt it be "most costly" or "most expensive"? Weird.

      My dad's another silly cat lover who never admits it.  He just threw Spooky a piece of scallop for a snack. I never really get to eat scallop like that...  Then he delibrately opens a can of tuna at the door so that she would hear it. But Spooky was not fooled, knowing that kind of tuna was inedible for cats.  Time and again, my father will try to play with Spooky, if not, scare her with the vacuum cleaner. And if he's somewhere else such as Queenstown, Redhill, those old HDB estates where there are alot of fat cats around, he wouldnt resist the temptation to bend down and give a pat.  Hmph. He clearly likes cats. But he doesnt want another one. Bleh.

      Since i'm not going to post at mwfc anytime around and wishes to vent my anger somewhere more open, where i hope some teacher wld read it and hunt me down for what i have said here.  MRS LIM IS A TOTALLLY RIDICULOUS TEACHER.  I'm less angry now. She's the most *ahem* teacher i've ever come across. For heaven's sake, who does "newspaper articles ON FOOLSCAP"? Obviously use computer faster what.  Somemore must do EIGHT! Is she trying to suck up to Mr Yue? Last year call us to do twenty. She's not young anymore, still wanna play with such tricks.  Then again, gave us 2 comprehension passages. I havent done the one Mrs Wong gave us previously. Although she teaches BN, supposedly to be a "good" class, how come her class had so many failures in the CT? As for our dear MW, had NONE. Yay!!  Of course, this time it's a bit harder. 12 failures altogether for both classes for SA1. Bleh.  Then again. That torturous teacher gave her classes an additional of 8 journal entries. But i could never get down to my homework no matter how i tell myself how "little" it is. Argh.  Recently SY (or was it Made?) asked Mw whether she would come back before the semester ends after she has gone to give birth. Then i said (in chinese, as u can see that it's direct translation) "you want her to die arh. she october leaving and u call her to come back before november.." MW sniggered. SY (or was it Made?) got the message.

      Now that i've decided not to talk (to anyone) for the time being because of my supreme anger, i'm going to write some crap here.  Yes, i've finally spent the $10 Tangs Voucher. Oh hell. It was so *****y hard to spend. So in the end i bought a wallet for my dad. Not really i bought, cos my mom paid the balance. It was a Goldion wallet. I think my mom paid like.... $59? Argh, dunno lah.  After all that excitement from moving the MWFC, it suddenly dawned upon me that my class won the chalet. Yeah! Well, that'll shut someone's mouth for a few days i guess.  Yeap, Joel got the $100 voucher. He didnt really win FG's highest, but as a class, we won them. Guess what? The only CA1 faliure for EL in my class was Tan Chiaw Sang.  As for me, i can tell you that my L1R5 was like shit. For starters, i had 4 for my L1 already. My R5 looks more like a puddle of mud.

      I went to watch Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban yesterday. The movie started at 11.00am. As usual, my sis has something to do before she leaves the house. My mom, on the other hand, hasnt bathed.  By the time my sis gave up on the zipper that came off her shirt and did what i told her (change into another shirt; I told her that like 20 mins before she changed), my mom was done with her washing up, it was 10.28am.   I knew it would be coming. And we werent going to watch it TM's GV. We were going to Somerset's Cathay Cineleisure. My mom refused a taxi ride there. GREAT.  And so we missed about 20 mins of the show. But the rest of the show wasnt that good either. So, although this show hasnt been rated 4 and above, i'll be watching it again. Argh.

      Seriously i dont like adults telling me their problems. Even if they do, i'm pretty fine with it. I'd just forget it in a few days.  I guess MW havent been talking much these few days eh? Once she talks, she cant stop. Well, i cannot imagine how she can talk for so long. My legs are getting wobbly today...  Actually what she said mostly is what i have thought before. Well.. we might have well moved earlier when aaronick asked whether to move to MSN groups. That'll have us some time and effort and fear.

      I always find one section of the supermarket less crowded than usual. Guess what? It would always be the Sweets and Junk food section..  Many parents love to avoid it. My father isnt fast enough for me. I got one packet of Sapporo potato chips and threw it in the basket. He didnt notice. I walked away smiling.  I thought he knew when he was queueing up. Until when he was about to put the basket on the counter and he saw it... But it was too late. Muahahaha! I've won! Well, so he bought it for me, somehow unwillingly.  Dunno why i so lame post this online.. could have bought it myself anyways... haiya.. sian...

      Rainy mornings.. nv a good sign... not a good start..  Indeed.  I heard my phone ring this morning. Toot-toot, toot-toot. That was around 8am, 7.40am to be exact. I thought it was Ah Tan, so i ignored it (as usual) and went back to sleep. It was such a nice morning. Bed so warm.  When i finally woke up at 9.13am, i grabbed my hp and was surprised to see 2 messages from Mw and 1 from Pak Nian. Weird, no one sends me messages so early.  I knew something bad was coming.  MW: Dear Eunice & Pak-Nian, been thinking about the blog and first of all, want to say a big thank you for it. I hear that some teachers have got wind of it (not from me) and read it to know what's going on in my classes. One of the biggest challenges I face is coming from a named school. There's much jealousy resulting in much gossip, some vicious ones. While i cant help with another's insecurities, I'll do what I can to not feed it. That's why I ask for no gifts. They can make fun of that but at least my students didnt overspend their parents' hard-earned money. Besides I've all I need. Ask TK. He knows i'm a simple person. We've know each other for 18 years. One request. Will you consider closing the blog this holiday? It'll save me some effort of dealing with some teachers. Hope you understand.  Me: I do respect your comments. Mdm rose knew about the club long before you did; she found it out herself.  Mw:And i believe she shared it with some of the teachers who do not share the sentiments. ACS-I's P(rincipal) has left door open for me to return. I get along with the boys. The teachers are more experienced and professional there. Perhaps it's better to be back where i belong. Or leave teaching to return to private sector. I'll decide after Ashley. Thanks for understanding.  I really dont understand. Someone please enlighten me on this jealousy thing! Why would other teachers be jealous? Shouldnt that motivate the others to work harder to gain the student's liking? sighs.. something has to be done anyway. If this really causes some harm, i guess we shd close it down or what. I should have known. I did thought of that when we opened this club, but i didnt know it wld really happen.  Tell us what to do please.

      Finally some real English work. Okay, so I'll have to rush this before tomorrow and send it off to Mw before I become&nbsp;"The Outsider". Mw says that she wld convert "the outsiders" to "insiders". Insiders of the DM's office. Cunning.  As I was waiting for the bus to arrive at Tampines Interchange, something caught my attention. Imagine- I was so damn tired after that 2.4 km run, and it still managed to catch my attention. There were this couple sittting right opposite my queue and they were kissing. To me, it just simply looked as if they were sucking each other's saliva. Urgh.  After (let me see) about one minute, they disentangled their lips from each other and started talking. After 2 minutes, the guy turned around and "sniffed" the girl. Not long after, they glued their lips together again.... It was disgusting. Infront of so many people!  Well, you can imagine how many people were watching.. But they just seem to be in their two-person world and kept talking and kissing... But that was good. It sparked&nbsp;off&nbsp;an idea for my discursive essay.

      Not that I'm airing dirty laundry, but I have to let it out before "garbage grows".   Recently I've noticed something about Mw. Something offensive. When she lost one of her pictures, alledgedly taken by some student, she requested it to be returned. By calling that particular person (in which none of use knew who) a "moronic idiot".  At first, I thought it was okay. For I have this very bad habit of calling people idiots who have crossed my way when I'm in the worst of moods. Days later, at Table Tennis, Madeline and I have this usual tiff over the word "idiot". Wei Ling asked Mel about the idiot thingy, and I heard Mel explaining to Wei Ling. Looking at it from a different point of view, I found it very offensive.  Everyone has their flaws, and Mw's speech is something I really dislike sometimes. Although sometimes I may it call it cunning, but sometimes it gets really irritating when she speaks so soft just to try getting the boys to keep quiet. Like they will.  I've noticed some other instances, but I cant be bothered to list them down now. Gotta do this discursive essay titled "How important is love in keeping marriages together?". SIGHS.

      This is just a drill. For my real reflection for Mw. Actually i havent really thought abt this.  Life is given to us by God. Due to imperfect genes, people will make mistakes.  (reminds me of bic.)  These mistakes, sometimes will bring us undesirable consequences. While some, are milder. But these mistakes allow us to learn something new, in our one and only life.   (Okay, what have i just said got to do with Life?)   Life is full of ups and downs. Experience brings in new knowledge. Before that, we have two special people teaching us what is right and wrong- our parents. They have experienced whatever we are going through now, even if they havent, their advice would be useful up to a certain extent.   (To be continued... Yawn.)

      I like people who dont ask too many questions. About why I do this or why I did that.   Actually i had the plans to attend English remedials for the tutorial group. Due to sec four prelim oral, MW postponed it to Friday. Initially today, but too bad we had Physics. Pathetically, only 15 out of 35 turned up. If I was&nbsp;Mr Gan, I would be glad that someone even turned up.   So. I'm unable to attend Friday's remedial. I've told Mw about it, and I do intend to ask someone to keep a copy of the notes&nbsp;for me. She sounded as if I planned to play truant...   This week I had no way of escaping weekly assembly. The lady just droned on and on about her bio-whatevers. But of course, what I really remembered was&nbsp;her "certy"s. And I thought she spoke like a retard. Less than 20 mins into the talk I was already brain dead. Well, when i told my mom abt her, she&nbsp;replied, "You better dont get into that school!"  Pak Nian said Ms Ang's like Mdm Rose in the sense of "clinging on" to me. Is that true? Nah. I dont think so. Sighs. What else is new? I'm getting bored of LIFE already.

      Well well well. VT strikes back.  She revealed to us something about her SMS to a student. If i didnt rem wrongly, it was a boy. She told that guy that she had 11 periods that day. School wld be flooded with blood. Disgusting!  Then she went on to educate the boys about the blood.  Although i thought it disgusting, it was something to laugh about. And to blog. Lol.

      Well well well. Mw's English lessons are getting interesting, while her History lessons are getting more and more boring.   The interesting part is, Mw was using our "china" part to force the "england" out of us. By very simple means- translation. She read a Chinese picture book on Life Cylces, while we write the whole story out in English. Interesting eh?   On the other hand, due to my poor vocabulary, I had difficulty trying to translate "small bird" and "grow big". One of the cycles was (in&nbsp;direct translation):  Bird egg -> Small bird -> Grow&nbsp;up (or big) -> Mating -> Bird Egg ->&nbsp;Small bird.....  How agonizing.&nbsp;Cos this week, we're&nbsp;doing on another 4 letter word. Life.  &nbsp;

      Let me see.. How long have I stuck myself to Hotmail? Around 3 years, I guess. I started off with Yahoo!, but soon switched over. Till now, I still wonder why I did that.   Yes, while I was attaching some files to&nbsp; the email I intended to send to my dear classmate Daryl, I saw this link "Send larger attachments soon!"   And when I clicked it out of curiosity, what I saw was "Get MSN Hotmail Plus!" Dumb. And one of the features was.... 2GB mail storage. Ahhh. No thanks. Given the speed of Hotmail, I guess I wont spend that kind of money per year for lousy service.   And this "Disclaimer: The McAfee.com virus scanner may not be able to detect all known viruses and variants. Please be aware that there is a risk involved whenever downloading e-mail attachments to your computer and that, as provided in the  urlLink TERMS OF USE , Microsoft is not responsible for any damages caused by your decision to do so."   Microsoft. Disclaimer. Wouldnt that render your virus scanner useless when it couldnt scan some of the viruses? Of course, there would always be risk, but if people use your service, at least let people have a sense of sercurity while using your services.   "Caused by my decision to do so." So it's our fault eh?

      I went to ACSI with MW, Jie Chong and Qing Hui last night. Wha......  Okay, starting with building structure. I must say that it is very confusing. Just look down those stairways. Urgh. Then they have this corner of the hallway which has a lot of names and pictures. Hall of Fame. MW suggested throwing stones at the pictures.  Alright, then Mw brought us to the Staff room. Unlike ours, it only had a single level. MW showed us her old table, and it was smaller than the ones they provided at our school. MW claimed that it was very squeezy at the old place. Try to imagine this: their floor area is roughly two and a half times of our single staff room. Squeeze in all the Chung Cheng teachers in. Woah.  Every level has their color. MW claims that it's for ppl who cant count. Their classrooms are very neatly allocated, such as sec one on the first floor, sec two on second floor, etc. Unlike ours. Like rojak.  They have their own swimming pools, own running track with the field in the middle, tennis court and goodness-knows-what. BUT! Their classrooms really look like toilets. Fully tiled all the way up to the ceiling just for the convenience of cleaning the walls whenever they are dirtied by silly boys playing in the classroom.  Their file check includes locker check. We're lucky that we dont have that. MW said she used to take those charcoal thingy (tongs?) to pull out those underwear and socks that are in the lockers...  Okay. Enough. I hate it when I dont study in a school like this. In fact, it doesnt even sound like a school.

      Another round of applause for Pak's most recent entry! Yeah. Ms Bic....  &nbsp;  Well, did i say that she's fatter than MW? No? Yes? I'm saying&nbsp;that again.. She's fatter than MW!&nbsp;  Yeah! I'm going with MW to ACSI this Thursday night for their mini-concert. Okay, nothing great, but I've been wanting to take a look at their school and breathe some (polluted) outside air before I turn moldy at home with my school books. Erm. I didnt know how to go to ACSI. MW said she would bring us there.  &nbsp;  Btw, the NIE person came today to observe our SS lesson. (Darn this firewall! Keep buzzing..) 3 JT, as usual, crapped all the way... For starters, Jon, Fred and Aurick sang into the recorder when it was suppose to record us discussing our group work. Jon came over with the recorder when MW reprimanded them and Jon claimed that my group was too serious and was totally silent. MW told Jon that the NIE professor wld be listening to the tape. He was shocked.  &nbsp;  Although I was asked to keep the outfit, I returned it today. [i was so afraid that it wld fray or what-so-ever cos it was Thai silk which required dry washing. my mom, the washing expert, told me just use hand wash. Rem my mom managed to remove my  mo  ink from my shirt?] MW told me I should keep it, but I held it out and shook my head. I gave her no choice.  &nbsp;  For the first time i felt MW so thick skinned! I had to help her take her stuff back to staff room, and so I took the paper bag with the webcam, the outfit and her bottle. She stopped me&nbsp;and said, "Wait, this one heavier!" and beckoned me to take her bag with the hand holding her bottle. Well, well, well. What to do? So she walked back to the staff room with her holding her red bottle, talking as she walked with the NIE person. Slow as snail. Leaving me with 5mins to gobble down my recess with my classmates 'coup'ing my lunch from the styrofoam container.

      Apparently  Somebody  couldn't tell the difference between 'shit' and 'sheet'. On the way home, somehow i was talking about a  sheet  of paper. Stressing on the  eeeeee  part of the word, I told Pres that obviously  shit  is shorter as compared to  sheeeeeet . &nbsp; This person walking in front me heard me and tried pronouncing the words 'sheet' and 'shit'. Obviously both words didnt sound different to her. Thus, in this entry, I'm going to tell you that SHEEEEEEET and SHIT is different! Just like 'bitch' and 'beach', where beach is longer like so: beeeeeeeeeeeeech. As for 'bitch', it would be just short and errr... sweet. &nbsp; Tell the difference now? So do it correctly! Darn it.

      Someone has just added fuel to my fire. Now i'm so angry that i couldnt help letting out some steam here. Racial Harmony. Yes, I do agree that its essential. However, just by wearing those stupid clothes how do you expect racial harmony to occur? Just by the snap of the fingers? (Don't forget, I'm in a Chinese&nbsp;school,&nbsp;we wear the clothes for who to see?) &nbsp;  Yes, this stupid incident has caused me to look at MW from a different angle. This feeling is just so strange, like i've never felt this way to her before. Seldom have&nbsp;I felt this kind of dislike for a teacher I've liked so dearly.&nbsp;Well, she managed to convince the whole class to wear something on Monday. By telling the boys what to do. So in this case, the girls would have to wear something too. Claiming that i would spoil everything, they are trying to force me to wear something.  &nbsp;  If I haven't guessed wrongly, someone is trying to rope in help from Jie Chong. Yeah, he's the guy sitting behind me and also the guy i sat with for two days when Qing Hui was away. And also the top guy in class.  &nbsp;  Back to racial harmony. This *idiot* here is trying to get me to wear something on Monday, by telling me that I'm Vice-Chairperson, need to wear, everybody give me "face"&nbsp;so&nbsp;I need to&nbsp;wear. Ms Ang also tried getting me to wear something. What the toot. Seems that Mw managed to convince her. Darn it.

      Yeah, I'm here to blog about Ms Tan again. She's feeling depressed. Maybe this explains the weirdness. Well, I've gotten all recorded in my organiser. Due to  some  reason, I've decided only to write down only SOME here. &nbsp; Ytd she started on the reactivity series and (blah, blah, blah) the sentence was: Please smell cos&nbsp;'Magdeline' and Zhiyin in the loo having constipation, so 'grose'! &nbsp; At the start of the lesson she tried comparing muscles with Aurick. Bad choice. She then arm wrestled with Gui Jia and Aurick. Of course she lost. That's all I actually remember, in fear of leaving the comp i would come back and see my mom at the seat. &nbsp; Oh yes! Sylvester was playing with his wooden duck he made last year during DnT and Ms Tan took the duck away. "Even the duck wanna listen to my lessons!" Joke! "Quack quack quack!!!" And when she was talking about jewelry she retorted," Ahhh! The silver is reacting on me!" (with grabbing actions).  &nbsp; How "amusing"!

      Wow. No more ugly Courier New! Anyway, I'm here to compliment Pak's recent entry. &nbsp; Yeah, I find this 'beast' has serious attitude problem. Even if YOU, the 'beast in cage' decides to drop by, pls do note that this is MY blog and not YOURS, i have all the right to write whatever i like here. So, shut up. &nbsp; Anyway, back to this 'beast'. Have you ever noticed that whenever somebody wrote just ONE tag about her blog (maybe something negative), she would react to it with such a BIG reply. However, with dozens of people wishing her Happy birthday, she wouldn't even reply one. &nbsp; Serious attitude problem, am I right? Moreover, her students seems to be brainwashed by her. Bleh.

      Hey hey! Guess what.. I'm in the staff room blogging! Yeah, as usual, nothing in the school is state-of-the-art so the comp's burning the CDs real slow. Cant help but to blog somemore. Lol.  I'm now trying to attach one stupid file to my Yahoo! account and send it off to PN, but apparently this stupid comp didnt manage to attch it within ten minutes. Still attaching.. Argh! I've burnt TWO CDs but this yahoo havent even managed to attach this one little file. Idiot.  Yeah, suppose to be assembly now. But i'm now in the staff room doing some serious work. ok. Half. When this CDs are burning, i'll blog. Ahhh... It was pretty hard trying to attach a file to my yahoo account with so many teachers looking. No wonder they have this comp that's in a special cubicle. So no one can read the mail.  Alright, the keyboards are too noisy (and DUSTY!!). Imagine Daryl and i blogging at the same time... NOISE! HAHA.. Lol.  I re-arranged the tables in my classroom into four neat rows. I forbade Yi Hui to move the table back, but she didnt want to sit with Madeline. Well, so i sat with Jie Chong. In Qing Hui's seat. Qing hui had bowling today, so he wont know. But he'll know tomorrow. He's going to sit with MADELINE!  HAHAHAHA.. Wonder how many people's going after my blood. Aurick's going to sit with Joel. Actually, I'm not very keen on sitting with Jie Chong but one thing why i chose to sit with him was becos he was first in class. He could help me with my work. Indeed.  Well, well, well. Now Daryl wants to read. Better end here. Ta ta!

      Although I dread school, there's many things I look forward to in the new school day, not to forget MW!  MW's lessons are getting steadily boring. Mainly because she's trying to control the 'naughty boys' in the class who disrupt the class. Personally, I think those guys are really distracting and they constantly slow down the teaching. Good.  However, Ms Ang's going to have a rough ride with my class. She made no effort to fight the boys, but instead asked Zhi Yin to raise her voice so that she could hear her. Poor thing. Reminds me of Mrs Yeo when she had a rough time with my class in the beginning of the year.  Mdm Rose said she could see that Mrs Yeo was having a very hard time with us at that time. I had the idea that she nearly cried. I dont know.  Not to say Ms Tan! Dickson threatened to show Ms Tan the entry i made earlier during IT club. Uh-oh. If she catches a glimpse of that.. I will never be able to redeem myself... Yeah, she's still as lame.  Mr Gan need no effort to keep the class quiet. Naturally, we're usually very quiet during Physics. Bored to death. Most of my classmates would be half asleep or smth.  Ms Ang asked me whether the class was too slow. I reckon why she asked me this was because i always look so free during E Math lessons while Zhi Yin wld bury her head in the stack of graph papers. I told her its not, because i love just that speed. I could easily finish my other hw. Hehe.  Right. Getting boring. Lemme search for Jolene Yang's pic for Qing Hui... Special request from him!

      Dont even know why am I writing this at this hour when i'm in the midst of doing my unfinished EL hw. Argh!  Oh yes. For the second (i think) time this year have I seen MW lose her temper. Brrr. Yeah, we were at Comp Lab 4. Seated in between two air conditioning units that was (i believe) going at full blast. That was really CoLd.  Well. MW suddenly became mad and scolded us. What's so scary is that she can smile while scolding us. She warned us no to try her. She said if we tried to inflict an injury on her she could bring us to court. I already had the idea of who she was talking about.  Chiaw Sang. Ahh.. Yes. I heard him talking about MW's lecture this morning. Only then did it hit him that she was pregnant. How slow can he be? Arghhhh..  Pak Nian said Mw looked fatter. Keng Mun said that too, when Mw was still in the History room. And Ms Soh seemed to have shrunk. Even Daryl looked bigger than she is. Ahh. I always had this feeling that she's under-nourished.  I had to run back to the History room to fetch the CD from Sin Yee. Ahh. How untimely. Just then the comp hanged on Ms Soh and was not in the mood to entertain me. I told her coldly that what i was doing wasnt personal but school stuff that MW asked me to do. Only then she kept quiet allowed me to get the CD from SY. She thought i was trying to do some personal stuff with SY.  Yeah, I ponned CME all the way and was at the staff room munching away on MW's waffles. Ahh.. Not bad. But cocoa stuff didnt go well with 7-Up Ice. Designed a CD cover for the SL learning package tour but unfortunately, the HP printer parked at the staff room was low on ink. The pics just looked like blotches of ink. The laser printer, however, was only for black and white.  Ms Gan said Daryl and I were enjoying ourselves in the staff room. Madeline described us as "lounging" in the staff room. Ms Gan asked who was our CME teacher. Not knowing what to say, I blurted "the fat fat one".  She is fat what, isnt it?

      Speech day has been so crap. We wore ties that strangled our necks and waited for the VIP guest to arrive. The school called us to queue up at 3 pm. I was late, anyways. Entered the Grand Audi at 3.30pm. They played the Lake Odessy's VCD and all of us got bored of it.  The Yishun (branch) side was more discipline than us, i must say. I was consoled upon seeing their ties, for it was uglier than ours. Phew~ But they didnt need to wear them. Idiot.  The VIP shua da pai came only at 4.30pm. And i didnt know that our school alumni's chairman was 97! (He came at 5) Oh my goodness. He could hardly even stand up straight. We ended up being dismissed at 6.20pm. Idiot.  My keyboard just went bonkers again. Crap.

      1 Jul 04  Dear Mr Chan, I understand your concern of Eunice receiving a gift from me. She has truly been a blessing to me and when I read that her keyboard and mouse were giving her problems, I thought this was an excellent opportunity for me to give her a birthday gift, in advance, that was practical and timely. I hope you will allow her to keep the gift as a token of my appreciation for her helpfulness and as a source of encouragement for her to keep up the good work at school.  Yours truly, Michelle Wong  Wow. I havent been feeling so happy before. Alright, its time to deflate this big head of mine and starting on those goals i've worked out during the hols. When i told her about my not celebrating birthdays, she gracefully accept what i've said and told me to treat it was a parting gift. For more info, pls visit *our dear msn groups*.

      Verily Tan, my Chem teacher is no more decent than the guys in my class. She threatened to sit on Fred's 'balls' if he continued talking. Of course she couldnt, so she backed off.  Stupid woman. Every Chem lesson she wld end up saying something lame. She once threatened He Fan to take off his specs so that he couldnt see what she was writing on the board. Idiot.  Oh yes, and she had this stupid idea of treating the top five persons for Chem in the class. But she's only paying $10 each. What can u eat at Marshe using ten dollars? Sausage? Still say me sour grapes. Like i wanna eat with her. Looking at her will make me puke.  Oh yeah. Mrs Wong is trying to get Ms Ang to stayover with us for the chalet. I wonder if she'll make it. While our class treasury is running low on funds, i wonder how much we'll have to pay for food. Or maybe CS will be paying. He's fithy rich, he is.  Darn that Verily Tan.

      [ urlLink Source ]  He said there are two emergency support units to monitor lift operations and assist in case of emergencies - one each for councils in eastern and western Singapore. The  western  unit in  Chai Chee  was hit by the blackout and had no backup power.  Ironically, the  eastern  unit in  Bukit Merah , which had backup power, was not affected by the outage.  Ok. Since when is Chai Chee on the West of Spore while Bukit Merah is on the East?

      I hate chickens! Esp when I have to clean them. I mean, the chicken that's dead and is going be consumed. Well.  I dug out what seems to be the lungs, and the windpipe for one of them.. Notice "one of them"? I did it for like 6 times! ARGH! I had to clean off all the yucky stuff inside their necks. [Ok, maybe I should make this clear. It wasnt a whole chicken, but just the neck and ribcage area.]  My dad said the two red stuff is their lungs.. And I was so totally grossed out. Well, I couldnt resist the temptation of giving it a good hard queeze and out burst slimy red stuff. It's not blood. It's the flesh. ARGH.  I had to skin the chicken too, and it was totally tough cos the skin's held with the flesh with this tissue and i had to literally tear the skin off the chicken. But i had some fun with the chicken hair. It's fun pulling out the hair.  By the time I was done with it, I felt like vomitting and not eat anything at all. But, since i have spent so much time and effort on the chickens, why not just eat the marcaroni but NOT the chicken. Yeah, I downed 3 bowls.

      My sis's going into partnership with two of her classmates, in which one of them is her best friend, Shu Ling. The one who has a 12" Powerbook G4.  They are selling earrings. The products are all hand made, and you can guess how much time my sis is spending on all these earrings. Making them, not wearing them. Of course, they are mostly made up of swarovski crystals. I havent have any pics of them yet. But they have a stall in their school bazaar.  I was a little shocked at first when I heard that she was going into business. Not my type. I prefer to slog for other people and recieve regular pay. Btw, my sis is only 21. She havent even turn 22 this year, and of course she doesnt have any money for anything. So naturally my mom's her ATM.  Argh, I just hope my sis will be successful in this business venture, with Encarta's definition of "risk-taking businessperson". While I, is going to save up, and to work for my iPod 20GB.

      Darn! Why is Blogger back to its old self? What the heck.  My mUm read some of my incoming SMSes when I was asleep. Apparently, I left them on the coffee table and she just picked it up when she heard the beep-beep sound. Read it, and switched off the phone as if nothing happened.  And guess what? Those messages were from MW and I didnt know that there were new messages!! Until this afternoon when i decided to check my inbox... And saw unfamiliar messages. Darn it!  Anyways, Mw was talking abt her meeting her old students (girls) and how they sported long hair, tight clothes and make-up. They're in Poly now, and MW reckon it's one of the pluses of being in Poly. And she reckon I wouldnt sport long hair. Actually i have half the mind to.  She was sure that I'm college bound. And about make-up, I can assure anybody that's reading this that my mUm would teach me that when i start working. Trust me. My sis started to make up when she started working, becos that was only formal to do yourself up. And so some stupid crap thought my sis had a BF. Erm. Yah.  Grrrr... Next time I'm not going to let my HP out of sight ever ever ever again! I hate it when ppl read my messages.

      I went to Wheelock place today and I visited the Apple Centre. I took the pricing list and saw that iPod's costing between $458 to $748. iPod mini is relatively more expensive than the 20GB iPod as iPod mini only have 4GB, and costs $458.  There's this new monitor Cinema Display 20", 23" and 30". I played with the 30" one. So big! Even if I have the money, I wouldnt get that just for my viewing pleasure. Cos my mom's going to peep on all my conversations even from the sofa. And the iMac- I simply love the monitor!  Apple now has this colour coded keyboard. Most of the keys have a color and each color represents a command. What, I dont know. I found the keyboard particularly hard to use. It's letters were too small. Seems that I'll never get a Powerbook G4. Sobbs.  Ah yes. There's this Mac Office or whatever you call it by Microsoft. What the hell! I dont think Mac needs any help from Microsoft. Okay- maybe they would. I find that Apple stuff are simply too expensive for my liking. I mean the price, of course. Not the hardware.  One more thing- I hate the trackpad on Powerbooks. Its either too sentive of insensitive. I've played with Mw's and my sis's best friend's Powerbook and both Powerbook's trackpad were so so so SO hard to use. And i find it hard to use Mac with only one button on the mouse.  Yeah, so the first Apple product that I think I would get would be the iPod 20GB and stick to my ol' Compaq computer.

      I topped two test papers. Woohoo! And the best thing was, I got both papers on the same day.  I've basically done a websearch through Yahoo! to see whether Enfresdezh is original. Pretty original, judging that Yahoo and MSN yield no search results. I know this does not prove that the nick is 100% not taken other than Pak Nian himself.  Mw wants me to submit my journal to her. My guess: She wants to know where I've went or why. Of course, I may be wrong, she may just want to know how I've been doing. Judging by what I wrote in my previous entry.  Oh yes. MW told me to change the seating plan. Again. But the seating plans are seldom effective for most teachers. Accept for one- Verily Tan. VT went on with her lame talk again. My weekly dose of laughter. It would be the most interesting if my FG friends see her in action. *Bi-Ba-Bom!  *Bi-Ba-Bom as u have guessed, is the sound of explosion. When Potassium is added to water. One of VT's ideas.

      Alright. Seems that I've missed a lot of action in my absence. Mw sent one SMS on Thurs and another on Fri. Well, I had to spend money to reply her. If not later she go and make police report...  I've done an overall review of the Century Mahkota Hotel (Melaka): Room: (+) Big (-) not clean anough (+) house-like (-) toiletries not complete (ie. no face towel, no glasses in the bathroom) (+) got curtains (-) leaky taps  Hotel: (+) Bell- boy (-) no cyber cafe (+) quiet (-) no transportation (+)much sports facilities (-) compound too large  There are eight blocks in all, each named after a flower. plant. whatever. My hotel room was a family apartment, with two bedrooms and two bathrooms. My bathroom had nothing other than 2 towels. Which explains the "no glass in the bathroom". The worst part was, when my father and I led the way and saw the small print under the "Century Mahkota Hotel".. I nearly wanted to stop there and turn around. It wrote: "Wholly owned by Ayer Keroh Resorts Sdn Bnd."  UH-OH. Ayer Keroh. That name made me recall all the bad memories I had at Ayer Keroh D' Village, one of Ayer Keroh's resorts at Ayer Keroh. But the stay at Melaka was okay. The bedsheets were clean anough, after all. No kidding- Ayer Keroh is a real place.
