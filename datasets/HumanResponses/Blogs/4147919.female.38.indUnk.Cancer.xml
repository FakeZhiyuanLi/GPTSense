      How Is Lupus Treated?  The type of treatment a  person  has depends on how severe the lupus is and what parts of her body are affected. People with SLE take some kind of medicine to control their lupus.People whose joints hurt often take acetaminophen (like Tylenol), ibuprofen (like Advil), or aspirin to help with the pain. Antimalarial (say: an-tie-mah-lair-ee-ul) drugs to help treat skin rashes and joint pain. (Antimalarial drugs are ususally used to treat the disease malaria, but some have also been found to work against lupus.) Some people take steroids, which are medications that help fight fatigue and fever and some of the other symptoms of lupus. For other people with more severe lupus that affects their kidneys or other organs, there are immunosuppressive (say: ih-myoo-no-suh-pre-siv) drugs. These drugs help hold back the activity of the immune system. They are very strong, though, and are used only when it's really necessary.

      How Is Lupus Diagnosed? When a doctor suspects a person has lupus, usually he or she will send the patient to a  rheumatologist (say: roo-muh-tal-ih-jest).  Rheumatologists are doctors who have special training in diagnosing and treating autoimmune diseases . (Autoimmune diseases are sometimes referred to as rheumatic diseases, which is where "rheumatologist" comes from.)  A rheumatologist will ask the person many questions about her health and look for certain symptoms of SLE. People with lupus often have a fever that comes and goes, weight loss, or painful joints. They may feel weak and tired. They may have muscle aches, a rash, loss of appetite, swollen glands, and hair loss. Sometimes they have abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting. Other people with lupus are sensitive to the sun, or they have lots of sores in their mouths. The doctor will also run some tests on the person;s  blood, so he or she can look for certain antibodies and other things that may be signs of lupus.

      What Causes Lupus? No one really knows what causes lupus. We do know that lupus isn't contagious, which means you can't ever catch any of the three types of lupus from someone. Scientists think that some people may be more likely to get it from a lot of things they can't control, like:      * being a girl (girls and women get lupus much more often than boys and men)     * having estrogen (a female hormone)     * your race (black, Asian, Latin, and Native-American people are more likely to get lupus than white people)     * a gene or genes that may make a person more likely to get lupus run in your family (about 10% of people with lupus have a family member with lupus)     * a major stress or an infection (if a person has lupus in her genes, extreme stress or an infection may cause the disease to start, but the setup for lupus has to be there: a really tough test or bad cold doesn't necessarily cause a person to get lupus)

      There are three types of lupus:  Systemic lupus erythematosus (say: sis-teh-mik lew-pus er-eh-thee-muh-toh-sis) is also called SLE and is the type that most people mean when they talk about lupus. It's the most serious form of lupus. SLE can affect the skin, joints, tendons, and other body organs like the brain, heart, lungs, and kidneys.  Discoid lupus (say: dis-koid lew-pus) is a skin disease that causes a rash on the face, neck, scalp, and ears. It's a much rarer form of lupus than SLE. It doesn't affect organs the way SLE can, but the rash can leave scars.  Drug-induced lupus is caused by a reaction to some kinds of medicines. Drug-induced lupus affects the body in the same way that SLE does. Once a person stops taking the medication, the symptoms often go away.

      What Is Lupus? Lupus (say: lew-pus) is an autoimmune (say: aw-toh-im-yoon) disease. Normally, a person's immune system makes antibodies (say: an-tie-ba-dees), which are special chemicals that fight off infections caused by germs that enter the body. But the immune system of a person with lupus gets confused. It can't tell the difference between germs and some of the body's normal cells. So it responds by making autoantibodies (say: aw-toh-an-tie-ba-dees). These are antibodies that attack the body's normal cells.  It's a little like a soccer game gone haywire: instead of the defenders of a team protecting the goal, they actually turn against their team. They begin attacking their own teammates and scoring on their own goal.
