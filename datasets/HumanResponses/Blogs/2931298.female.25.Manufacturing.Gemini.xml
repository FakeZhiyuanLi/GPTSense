      Just yesterday I was thinking, I am some sort of cursed kitten...why?..simple, I have worked for 3 differente people in 3 different jobs and all of them have been fired. How can this be happening???...Now now don't think I'm responsible for these disgraces, things happen and you know it and they were all coincidential.   So today I thought, I will place a blog as if I am advertising me as a "lucky" charm. And here it goes:  If you would be desperately looking in the yellow pages or the news paper for "Head Hunters", my picture would be on the first page and this would be my add.  " If you are tired, desperate, and crazy looking for a better way of releasing yourself from the pressure, the pain and the agony your boss makes you feel because it makes your life miserable from 9 to 5 counting lunch breaks and even over time or even worst....YOUR DAYS OFF!!!. Do you want to get rid of all the problems but you are too busy to look for a job, or you have been working there for so long the roots under your office chair just won't let you go??...Stop looking!, Yoli can save you!...Yes, just call this number and have her working for your boss and before you know it your boss will be out of your job in no time....Yes....and the best part of all is you don't need to do a thing, just pick up the phone and dial this number and you will realize, if Yoli can't help you then nobody can...  Ok, gotta go because, it's 5:00 pm. bye

      Well, it's 10 minutes to 5 pm. This day has been the longest day of the year!.  I think my bottom is stuck to my office chair and I can't get out of it, that's how bad my day was. Fortunately it's almost time to go, by the way yesterday I caught the flu (I think it comes from far away in the midle east, my boyfriend is Iranian and his family has the flu..so now I do too), so with all that pain in my throat, the boring days in my work (what else can I ask for?, I get paid to do nothing and write blogs hehe, and still I am complaining....life is not perfect) and still the 6 minutes to go before 5 are being eternal! "wHEN WILL THIS EVER EENNDDD!!!". I want Hump day to come yeeahh! Wednesdays are my favorite day of the week again, two weeks ago I was not thinking the same but now I do, next week I will be working only 3 days (I love April!) April is my favorite month of the year (too bad for the allergies that come with it....life is not perfect though).  While I wait for tomorrow I can't wait till the end of the week, I want to get rid of this cold by next week, my best friend and I are supose to get together at my house and watch the Ellen Degeneres stan up comedy (can hardly wait for friday), I am an Ellen fan although I don't have time to watch her shows, Ellen rules!. If I was homosexual I would ask her to marry me, (too bad I am not).   Pleeasee cold go away!....  It's 5:00 pm so now I have to run... Take care, eat fruits and veggies and don't get to close to the monitor, (you might get contagious).  Adios

      Monday, I hate Mondays, Mondays are the worst days of the week for me:  1.Because I’m still sleepy from last weekend which I didn’t have enough time to rest. Why? Because my BF is like a bird, as soon as the sun comes up he’s awake.  2.Because this work drives me crazy on Mondays and is not because the workload is heavy…on the contrary..it’s slooowwwww.  3.Well..the point is, I hate Mondays.  Today, the weather sucks again, we are about 83ºF; I think I’m catching a cold due to the drastic change of weather (to think that just a week ago I was wearing sweater, undershirt and a jacket and today I am practically naked). My neighbor from work is screaming like hell, she’s starting to annoy me now, she hasn’t stopped yelling at his workers ever since she got in this morning; I wished right now I had a shut gun and just hold her furry head up the wall and practice gun shooting. (My head is still not good and I am having psychotic ideas about who ever annoys me today).   I’ll change the subject to have reminiscing thoughts about my weekend…let’s see:  So Friday night was “blank”, that’s how boring it was. I was in the mood to go out dancing but it never happen, instead, I finished doing my laundry and cleaning my house.  Saturday was good!. Super good, It’s been a long time since I didn’t enjoy myself with my best friend, ( I miss my single days btw) and it was revenge day (sounds bad but it’s true), for the first time in 6 months my boyfriend knew what it feels like to be left alone in the house while knowing your partner is having a good time outside; just when I came back from my day out, my boyfriend was already in his PJ’s and watching TV (with his boring looking face). It was still early 9:00 pm, my boyfriend was back since 4 pm so he had 5 hours of alone time just for himself (Yeah baby! That’s how it feels like when you leave me all alone every single day [including Saturdays and Sundays] while I know you’re having a good time out at your “family’s”).…..Sorry I just can’t help it. ….but feels good to make someone feel what you feel. (it’s all about sharing in a relationship right?).  Too bad I had to end up with a killer headache I could not kill even with Pain Killers .. How bad was that?.  Sunday….(Not good at all)  So as the headache continued until I could not take it anymore and it knocked me out, I must have fallen asleep at around midnight, while I waited for the pain to go away I watched a Porn movie from start to end and the start of another porn movie, but I thought, “this is too much!” (Maybe that was the reason why I could not go to sleep and my headache continued banging my head so hard).  While I was sleeping in the arms of  Morpheus my wonderful dream was interrupted with what I thought  was a mosquito trying to bite me, I opened one eye I saw it was my boyfriend trying to wake me up I looked at the clock and thought “this is rude! it’s 7:00 am and I just slept around 6 hours and this guy is already awake??”. I am always generous because every time I wake up early and I see my boyfriend is still sleeping, I know the cruelty of waking someone up so I just let him rest in peace (But he doesn’t!).   So there the Bad Hare Day started with an unpleasant “awakening”. Adding the fact that the weather was extremely hot (80ºF), I wanted to go to the movies but the weather was so annoying and we didn’t have groceries and again…the headache was knocking on my head. ( Oh this was too much!). So to make a long story short, and in conclusion, my Sunday sucked!.   End of story.

      Well today I have nothing to write about, my brain is flushed, I can hear my little walnut empty so, there's nothing inside.   While I was searching around all of your blogs, one interested me the most, well that and another one I read at first but I lost the name...anywho, finally after looking around in the blogworld I found a blog that it is interesting to my insane me, how cool is that?.   So now that I have found someone to match my blogs with (hehe) I may now rest in peace....for now...  Oh yeah!, something popped up my mind now; tomorrow I am making chocolate chip cookies for the 4th time in less than a month...I am not the pillsbury dough boy to bake that often but hey! it's a good deed (NOT) I'm taking profit out of it and my best friend is helping me, too bad I can't make profit out if the cookie business, the cookies are too damn expensive.  But what I am taking profit from is the day, finally tomorrow (I hope) I have some "ME and My Best Friend" quality time that ever since I started living with my current boyfriend I have not had the time to do. MEH! I miss my G.   I pray to the onmipresent to not go visit the "family house" this weekend (or any other weekend for the rest of the "relationship") or I'll shoot myself, (not really, but I would if I had the courage)  Enough of family business!!! I need a "family away" break, I need me!! alone, yeah!.   Have a good weekend kids!.   P.S. Don't be like me!...it's not pretty, actually is anoying.  The song in my mind right now (not that I don't listen to it but I can't listen to this song at work..it's embarassing) is: "HORNY" (Oh my god I'm Horny)  Adios!

       UGH!   F.Y.I…..I am Sooo NOT a family person. Now the coin drops on my head like a piggy bank, (NOT) I’ve known this since way before but I just can’t accept it and I can’t help it. It is just so annoying to see family more than….once a week. I’m not talking about my family though…well…I cut the umbilical cord since I was 20 because I could not stand seeing my own parents every day in the house…well now that explains it all.   And so the Saga continues….  So I went to the doctor on Saturday and it was not as I expected (feow!), it went much better, it didn’t hurt that much after all; I didn’t get to go with my best friend to the beauty salon because the appointment was canceled, and I went to buy my b/f  niece her bday present with my b/f. So Sat. was not bad at all.   Booooring Sunday….yes it was!. So we woke up way too early to be at my “brother’s in law” for the party, and guess what??!. Everybody was wearing a suit and tie for a barbecue?! (how weird is that?).   Issues that made me feel U.N.C.O.M.F.O.R.T.A.B.L.E.  So now I was feeling undressed for the occasion as I was wearing a regular summer dress (issue #1),  As we were running late for the party I didn’t have time to do my hair properly so I just dry it off and left, so after a few minutes with all the wind I was looking like  “Tina Turner” (issue #2).  All the people in the party, family members and friends were not familiar to me (issue #3).  My B/f brother in law was drunk and he insisted me too much on dancing with them (issue #4).  The weather was cold –and I was wearing a summer dress--(issue #5) Nobody spoke English!!! (issue #6) My b/f left me alone to go with his brother to the mini mart and buy more meat for the BBQ. In the mean time I had to be with me, myself, and ….the little one who after a few minutes felt bored and left me alone to go and sleep with her new bunny rabbit (issue #7) All the males in my b/f family were dancing like “fagots”—and they were not drunk-- (issue #8) All the women in the family were married with children (issue #9)  And last but not least!!!….  At the end of the night everything started to look a little bit better, we got into the house and put some decent music to dance until… My b/f and his drunk brother in law were dancing and in a second his brother in law touched my b/f  wee wee in front of EVERYBODY!…(issue #10).  At that moment I wanted to disappear from the faze of the earth.   Monday….”The Interview from Hell”  Well everything went as expected, except I had to wake up 30 minutes earlier and started the whole thing 30 minutes earlier, yep yep, a 20 minute interview…and after that, the unexpected came….  I thought, well, we were at the party yesterday from 1 to 8 pm (7 hours of family quality time I think it’s more than enough for a year or two) so we are going straight home right??…right?? who needs to see the family again the next day…right???…oh no…don’t take the south 805, no…you’re suppose to go straight!!…go straight!!!…NOOOOOOOOOOO…..dought!.  And yes, we were at my boyfriend’s brother home again. Right then and there I wanted to shoot him and run away. I wanted to leave as soon as we arrive but ugh!. Just looking at my boyfriend’s sisters faces all washed out from last night, my boyfriend’s brother in law had a hangover so he didn’t even want to look at me and my boyfriend was so happy I was looking at him and I could see in his eyes he wanted to stay all day over there but then he looked at me (Yoli Godzilla) and he realized I didn’t want to stay there for one more second, but still!, he went outside the Porsche and smoke one cigarette and chatted a little bit with his brother in law. What was I doing you’re asking? (well, as my boyfriend’s sisters were doing the chores in the house and they don’t speak my language I could not stay there looking at them, so I went outside with my b/f to follow him but I don’t like the smell of cigarette so …I was away, looking at the little ants carrying the leftovers of food from yesterday while I was waiting for my boyfriend to finish his cigarette. It was ETERNAL!!!. Then my boyfriend said the magic word…”let’s go” I was so happy but as soon as we got inside the house and he said goodbye to his sisters then the spell went away with the sentence “don’t go, stay for lunch with us”!….I could not help it and I said NO! I NEED TO GO!!!!.  Finally we left, it was horrible!, a nightmare, how can families live so happy seeing each other every day at every hour…!!! This cannot be!!!….I cannot believe it!.

       Scarry Friday!!!...   Yes...It's scarry...a lot S.C.A.R.R.Y.!.!.!...Why??...you wanna know why??...  Hell!, if you were going to an Urologist appointment the next day to have your pipi measured with a tiny "hose" you would be scared too!!...  So today, like I said last Wednesday, and I will change it now, this weekend will NOT...I repeat..it will NOT! be my favorite weekend EVER!, I don't want friday to end and I don't want Saturday to come, worst. I don't want Monday to come either (the Interview from Hell remember?). Ugh!, Right now I wished I had those hypnosis classes to have me fall asleep while Mr. Doctor (why do all Urologist have to be male???...women have problems down there too you know!!!) inserts that thing right there...(ok I won't be explicit or I'll faint right now), just last week I had almost the same procedure with the doc. but that time was with a tiny video camera..oh yeah they shot me over there can you believe that? they charged me $200 dlls to put a camera down there....(aren't I supose to be charging that much for taking video of my noble little parts??) and the biggest disilussion was it was only for 3 minutes AND IT WASN'T PLEASENT!!!, ....what a ride!.  So there's an addition of the occurrences for tomorrow, my schedule for this weekend looks pretty busy for a trauma of such nature.   Saturday 9:00 am Wake up, get ready, shave (for the friendly Mr. Doctor), 10:30 am, pick up my friend from her house (she's going with me to give me her support) and after that go to the Doc's clinic. 11:30 am, Do the undoable...OUCH! 12:00 am, You think that after that I am going home and have myself pampered after the intrussion??...you were sooo wrong!, I promised my friend since a month ago to go with her to the beauty salon to have her done an "Extreme Makeover", ( I know her, it won't be so extreme and at the end she will have the tips just cut off) all added to the pain and the fear of not being able to sit down for a few HOURS, So I guess I'll just remain stand while I see my friend having her hair cut while deep inside I wished I was in bed, watching tv and trying to forget the trauma. (There's no place like home...There's no place like home).  2:00 pm Go buy my "neese in law" her birthday present (knowing myself with the pain, I'll just pick what ever is infront of me in the childrens dept. and I don't care if it fits or not!...I'm illed!). 2:30 pm, problably have lunch with my friend at Burger King...(yeah! I'll have a double woper...forget the freaking diet...I'm illed). 3:00 pm Sorry dear friend, Yoli has pain..need to go home...bed...sleeeepp!!..paaiiinnn!!..  Sunday ....Ugh! Wake up at what ever time I wake up...I don't care...I'm still Illed (NOT...but...as if).  I am not so a family person and I hate being surrounded by people mostly if it's family members (don't ask why I'm a solo person). So it's going to be quite anoying to stay all day at my "brother in law" house for my "neese in law" birthday party...I'll probably just pass!....I'm not in the mood to listen to my b/f family talking in their language and me smiling like silly without knowing what they're saying, watching the "little one" yelling, screaming, crying and kicking everybody (except to me, if she does that she's DEAD...literally...you better not do that "little one"  *winks*).   Need comments...ycouttolenc@yahoo.com  Need to go away!  :'(

      The Interview from Hell!  I just realized that Wednesdays are no longer my favorite day of the week because it makes me feel lazy because it’s half of week and almost Friday and then the weekend, more today is one of the worst weeks of my year because I just got a call from one company I am trying to work at and they have had me going back and forth from one interview to another and I don’t know when this will ever end. Just Monday when I received this call and cute Lorena told me the “great” news that finally I was going to San Marcos, CA( I feel like I am running a marathon where I can see the Finish line) for the ultimate interview, today a woman named Te! (who in hell would call herself Te??!!) took me off my cloud ( I have the strange feeling I might have some future problems with her…she looks bitchy) saying this would be ONE of the last interviews (I went WHUT??!!!!…I thought this one was the last one!!!..) well, I was wrong, there’s one more to go (yeah right!, that’s what they have told me ever since I started the interviews). I have gone through the finance department, human resources, manufacturing, production, Corp.  manufacturing and maintenance ( I ask myself, why do I need to be interviewed by maintenance anyway?, are they going to ask me how I mop my house floor, change a light bulb or clean my toilet?)  Anyways!, that’s not the bad thing, the bad thing is I have never driven so far away around the San Diego County, just thinking about it gives me the chills ( I am a freakazoid when it comes to driving a car for a long distance) so really really really really am horrified…should I be?…of course I should!, and more because I have to drive for over an hour…just thinking that I have to cross the border from TJ and see this grumpy old man inspector asking me what’s the purpose of my trip my face will turn blue, my eyes will pup out and I will try to eat my lips along with my tounge showing my teeth with a silly cartoon like smile drawling  on one side asking my head to think of the answer and the only thing I can listen to is a fly going inside my head!!…Auugghh!!! this though kills me…but a girl’s gotta do what a girl’s gotta (what ever this say may mean…I find it meaningless right now) I have no choice but to go there. To tell you a little secret I am already planning for a lie to say so I don’t go there, it’s my only day off and I have to stress myself with this stupid interview…  I am thinking of my Monday schedule looking like this:  7:00 am wake up, take a shower, get dressed, dry my hair, do my make up,  8:00 am ready to go and up we go to make that huge border line for an hour wait,  9:00 am On the road listening to Jammin’ Z90 biting my lips till they bleed looking at the yahoo map and asking god to not miss one turn or I’ll really freak out!.  9:45 am I should be at this company taking big breaths and finally waiting for my appointment with my interviewer,  10 am having a nice conversation where I just repeat for the 6th or 7th time the same old story about how I had to leave college to start working and why do I want to leave  my current job,  10:25 am I am out there with a nice handshake and a BAD…BAD…BAD HEADACHE.   Conclusion: 3 HOURS of getting ready for a miserable 20 or 25 minute interview…Oh that’s just great!!!! And the way back looks a little bit less stressful but still I find it…WORTHLESS!!!.   I hope it doesn’t end up that way but just imagine me, right now Wednesday afternoon almost end of a day journey and I am already getting worried about how am I going to do it so I don’t have to go…because I don’t want to go!!…No.   Ah! What the heck, I’ll look at it as a mini road trip…NOT!

       Yoli Went Belly Dancing!!...   Well...not really. Finally after I don't remember how many weeks I really got to get familiar with my boyfriend's family, he's iranian so their culture is kinda weird. It was one of the beautiful "movie like" spring sundays...yes yes...we woke up early morning and right away got ready to go with the family. A little bit of carne asada and enjoy listening to my bf's family talking a language I really don't understand but I pretty much get entertained just looking at their faces and hearing manipulating their tounge to speak; then the ugly part comes, my 35 year old brother in law (who I really dislike) joined us along with a "teenager?!". My face turned blank and thinking just two months ago my brother in law's "fiance" telling me how much she loves him, OH MY GOD!...That ugly mutha fucka I hope his wee wee dries up and falls down to the ground and the worms eat it!....Anywho! that's not important (hope you die freak!).  So we finally got all together taking pictures of everybody, we were around 12 people plus 2 little girls (boy! the littlest one makes me nervous!!!!), we were all sitting down making a circle, the family was talking and laughin, I was laughing too but don't ask me why *sight*. Then I see the cutie pie of my bf nephew who is about my age....(if I were stilll single I would eat him head to toes..mmm..mmm) bringing two drumbs, well...I didn't know we were going to sing. I could have prepared myself to give my best gurgles; while the nephew was playing the drumbs everybody else was singing and clapping and one of my sisters in law was dancing in the midle of the circle...I remember watching all of that in the movies but never live on stage, it was exciting...then I took more pictures, it was a "KODAK MOMENT" I almost cried.   Well, then night came quickly and we went to the big brother's house, sure everybody was tired but not too tired to keep the dancing going....Oh goodness, I wished my family was like that...it reminded me, every time we have a family reunion in my family everybody ends up fighting and arguing...well...to begin with, there would be no family reunion because nobody likes each other...LOL, so there, my first "real" family reunion with "real" fun and "real" charisma with a "real" family that is not "officially" mine yet.   Everybody was dancing in circles and the women in the house where making these exotic moves "shakira style" and I was drewling just looking at them, my bf took me out to dance with them...well I must say I am a pretty good dancer but infront of family I turn in to a stick and I couldn't move not even the fingers but at least I tried, and by trying I twisted my left leg, I felt like an old woman! SHAME ON ME!. I still have the soar back and leg and to think I just dance like for 10 seconds yeeshh! I better start getting me some belly dancing lessons for next time. Oh by the way...there's another party going on next sunday so I better start practicing watching a full day of "shakira's videos" maybe something will stick on my head and I'll remember it no?. In the mean time....tah tah!

      Talking about "fitting in"...  So Friday’s suppose to be a casual day of work, no pressure, no boss, no bad mood, no work, which means you should be wearing comfortable clothing, that’s why the name “Casual Friday” comes from. It gives you a though you should wear comfortable clothing for that special last day of the week to forget about stress …right?  Well all the “Muppets” in this crappy joint so called “company” (LMAO at the concept ‘cause it looks more like a homeless shelter than a manufacturing company) think that regular office clothing are jeans, or sweatpants, baggie jeans, T-shirts with obscenities on the back, sneakers, an old dirty cap, and a drawl at the edge of your mouth is called “office clothing”.   But when Friday’s come the opposite happens. Girls would usually wear mini skirts, tight “hip hugger” pants where you can see women walking and can barely move or bend because the “G-string” might show, tang tops, and huge “hoochie Mamma” looking high heel shoes with platform and glitter all over (but they don’t want men to sexually harass them looking like this right?).   Guys would dress more decent, cashmere slacks and silk shirts with nice shiny “tap dancer” shoes (let’s not forget the white sport socks underneath those cashmere slacks).  All of them ready to go to “Dah Club” after work.   WTF????  These “Muppets” look at me every day with a “who’s that ridiculous woman looking like an Old G.” look on their faces Mon-Thurs and give me a dispective “this woman has no taste in clothes” look when I bring my jeans, shirt and comfy shoes on Friday.  I really don’t belong here!

      The more I ponder today the bitchier I get…  I developed a bad mood today ever since I was late this morning all because of the weather’s fault and the people who tell the weather. This is not nice.   My schedule for today was to wear a black silk blouse and white pants. But I felt the weather was too warm to wear black, so I changed into something cooler with no sleeves, then I heard on the radio there would be a 75ºF weather today and I had to change my clothes into something warmer…again, and that meant to dive inside my closet and start looking for something, what? I don’t know but something that would keep me warm; I tried 3 different shirts, a blue one, a brown one and a blue one with pink; neither of those were ok, but what the heck! It was getting late; I had to change pants, socks, and shoes. Hair was not yet fixed.   As I didn’t want to have the same horrible experience of having my hair burned, I had to use the drier from a distance, so far away from my head it really didn’t dry my hair, I forgot my anti frizz oil so guess what? My hair turned puffy, despite the “puffyness” of my hair, when I got out of my house the weather suddenly was not moist anymore and there were winds of 30 mph, so guess what? My hair was puffy…and developed static. Still, as I was running late I didn’t want to move my hair anymore or I would screw it up, so I just left it that way; but now, the weather is not windy, nor dry, now is moist with black clouds, so guess what? My hair is not puffy anymore, has no static, but now is half curly, half straight, half puffy, half ruined.   Am I right of being in a bad mood today?  Oh yes I am!  Don’t mess with Yoli’s hair…she could be mean!

      I pondered many things this morning on my way to work, and then, at work...  1) My hair don't fit today, neither does my clothing, and the weather does not match with my clothes. I'm freezing my tooshy.  2) The weather man is always wrong, no matter what station or channel you turn to, in my area you should do the opposite of what weather man says...I still haven't learned that, I keep doing it wrong, for that, I'm freezing my tooshy....lesson learned.  3)  In my school years (I feel old now) I never went through what parents or students are going through today in my country; I remember I used to walk any day or time to the school I wanted to go and ask for a pass for my admission test. Now, if you walk or drive nearby a school zone you will see an endless row of people with beach chairs, umbrellas and freezer boxes day and night...No they're not camping, or waiting for a parade to pass by. They're making line to get passes for admission tests to get into school.  4) I used to shake hands with one of my coworkers here every morning, one day, I saw him scratching his butt, and this continued throughout the day, several times, every time I walked by him he did the "itchy butt" move, and the same happened the next day, and the next after that. From that day on, I don't let him touch my cookies.  5) For 6 months, I struggled with all the managers at my work to send their reports on time every day. I tried many nice and polite ways to make them understand my boss needs his reports ASAP. Today, now that I'm leaving this company next week I have found the most effective way withouth shouting, emailing or phone calling them every minute...I stuck letter size post it notes on each office door as a reminder with my request with huge bold letters...that did not only made everything easier for me but it embarassed them all infront of the rest of the employees... If I knew this would work 6 months ago I would've been a happy Admin.  More on my ponders later this day.

      It really looks that I don't have anything to do right now...  Why is that every time long time ago when I used to chat on the internet people used to see me as a  "green rubber ball with fur".   Does this mean I look like a blob?, like a big bugger coming out of a nostril?   How did they guess that's how I feel? a  "big fluffy green rubber ball with fur"   I'll leave that to ponder for later.

      Cruela Devile is having one of her daily "yada yada yada's" in high volume, very, high volume.   I wished I could shoot one big ball of stinky used socks into her mouth so she shut up and faint from the odor at the same time.  This is what I picture in my head when I have a headache from too much shouting coming from this woman freak.  (Patience Yoli...just one week more and you're outta here)

      1.When people ask you what time it is and point to their wrist… I know where my wrist is! You don’t? When you ask where the restroom is do you point your butt too?  2.People who say “Hey dear” to ask you for something…I’m not your dear! Do you know what food makes me gassy? No right? Jackass!  3.It really, really pisses me off the people who are willing to search every corner of the house to find the remote control but are too damn lazy to change the channel.  4.When people tell you, “It always is in the last place you look for”… DUH! If it was in the first place I looked for why should I keep looking? PLEASE!  5.When you’re at the movies and the person next to you says “Did you see that?”…No dumbass! I paid 20 dlls to come to the movies and look at the ceiling! (These kind of people do not deserve to have a brain)  6.People who asks you “Can I ask you something?”…Like you’re giving me another choice! Just shoot the damn question!  7.Stupid questions when you say or do something:  a)I got stolen!…Who did it?  b) I lost my purse/wallet!…Where?  c) Something obvious happened to you and they ask “What happened to you? Did you cut your hair?” No A.H. I fold it and put duck tape in the back, or No, someone bite it till it got short.  d) “Oh You’re pregnant!”… No Dumbass! I swallowed a football and I am keeping 9 it for months.  e) “You’re here?”… No butthead! You’re looking at a freakin’ hologram  f) When you’re somewhere and the conduct should be obvious like a football field, a movie theater, a restaurant or a library, they say. “What are you doing here?”… Nothing, Just came here to wave at the waiters and I’m leaving, I came here to scratch my butt, I came to the library to get drunk and have a party. Jackass!   g) “Oh don’t tell me you’re smoking”… Nooooo! I’m just inhaling and exhaling cigarette smoke, but I’m not smoking!  h) “Are you crying?”… No, I’m laughing so hard tears are coming outta my eyes. A.H.   i) “Are you angry? No come on, tell me the truth, you’re angry right?… If you know everything then why in hell are you asking?

      Things always have to happen to me…  We’ve had 100º F temperature since last weekend and what worst can you expect when you come home from work all sweaty, hot and sticky and the only thing you want to do is take a shower with cool water. Right? Well that didn’t happen to me.  What did happen to me was everything except for the water part, there was no water in my house! So I thought everybody else was in the same situation as I was but I was wrong. I live in a 3 story building and my apartment is in the bottom, you know when you live in apartments you can hear everybody else’s noises where ever you move, and while I was complaining about my misfortune of not having water in such hot weather I heard a washer machine, that was weird, if there was no water nobody should be washing clothes, unless the people upstairs were dry cleaning in the washer machine?  Time went by and I still heard watery noises all over the building and I could not understand why the people from upstairs had the privilege; I checked my water bill and it was already paid and began to concern me. Now this something that makes you think something is really fishy; after 8 pm which means after 2 ½ hours of waterless time my other neighbor from upstairs arrived to her apartment, I heard her footsteps, I heard she went to the restroom, she peed, she flushed, the tank recharged, she washed her hands, and she TOOK A SHOWER!.   That’s when the coin dropped on my head, I was the only one with no water in the building. By the time I realized that it was already too dark and too late to go outside and check the water meter but still I went there and give it a check of why was I not getting any water. So there I went, and there it was, a big water leak on MY water meter (still didn’t make any sense), is that the reason why I don’t have any water? The water meter had been leaking for so long, the mud was not mud anymore, it was water with dirt.  This morning woke up at 4:00 am, and went and checked if I had water, and no, still no water, so I had no other choice but to take my shower “Mexican style” or as we call it in Mexico “banio a jicarazo” which consists on putting hot water in a bucket and with a little “jicarita” or tupper ware shaped in a bowl, take a shower as if you were moisting a turkey in the oven.  (You learned something new today)  Lil’O me is now teasing the water company every 2 hours to make sure the water company sends somebody to check on my water meter because I am not staying without water for another day.   Hell No!.

      Oh the pain…the agony!  If you’re curious how was the rest of my weekend, let me say this, in one way it was good, can’t complain, I stayed in bed all Sunday watching my horror movies which by the way sucked! I was expecting from the movies I carefully chose for about one hour in the video store to be more than scared of being home alone, on the contrary, those movies didn’t make any sense at all to the point where in one of those I fell asleep, how scary is that?  As I was doing practically nothing in my house I could not help to notice how dirty my home is, I found the living room sofas filled with dust as well as all the curtains in the house, the kitchen cabinets had hand splats all over, tomato sauce where you can’t even imagine, and a bunch of other defects I found, but all I could do is stare at the ugliness I am living in, I could not do anything else, I was devastated. Now don’t get me wrong, I am a very clean person but I don’t have the enough time to deeply clean the invisible places, so I just clean the visible ones, Clever!  I think that instead of giving my boss a 2 week notice before I start working at this other company I am going to give me 5 days off to clean up all the house from top to bottom, in every little corner I will see, hell I can even paint the walls. So I have decided I will make a cleaning schedule when I have my days off, that way I won’t waste my time on thinking what will go first.   After seeing the mess, I could not rest anymore, it was 10:30 pm and I was thinking on which cleaner to use to take that soap scum off the shower, what stain remover to use on the sofas. I ended up thinking it would be easier if I moved out of that house and make a mess out of the new one. He! At least I don’t have to deep clean right?  Everybody knows that after having long rests instead of feeling rested and ready for the working day it just doesn’t work that way, instead, you wake up lazy, sleepy and with a pain in your back as if you carried a big closet uphill. Well that’s how I feel now, my brain is all sucked up from the horror movies I saw and the cholesterol from the pizza I ate so practically I have no energy, but work already took care of that, yeah, with giving me nerve/stress shots early this morning and it still going. This has been the busiest working day ever since I started working for this company.   Somebody make it stop!!!  By the way, if someone knows how to take the comments on the top of my blog please be kind to tell me how, it makes me nervous to see two comments spots on one blog (I know I am a freak). I will appreciate it.

      It was about time to have some "me" time for Me...  Woo hoo! I'm all alone today; my boyfriend went with his brother and nephews to Laughlin to get things ready for next summer vacations, you know, take the big boat, an extra van and some other things they need; and well from San Diego to Laughlin is abouth 6 to 7 hours driving, so he will spend the rest of the weekend over there aaannnddd....wiippyy! I'm here, on the computer all to myself, the TV all to myself, hey it's still early afternoon and I'm already in my jammies hehehe. It's like a slumber party starring me, my bacterias and my dust. It's going to be a great "partei", so if you want to join in, you're so welcome.   Back on April 8 I posted a blog about plagues. Well, here comes all over again, I have ANTS! It all started on Tuesday and these little creatures just can't get enough of my bug spray, they die for it! So I just keep giving them more, I supose with my experience in bugs this will keep on going until summer ends, so I still have plenty of weeks to go; I better run to Costco and buy me a box of Raid. (Note to shop list)  As I'm posting my blog I am enjoying a delicious snow cone, this can't be more perfect, I rented 4 horror movies to watch today and tomorrow, bought my popcorn to pop, got me plenty of sci-fi books to read when I am done with the movies, and my weekend is planned (Cleaning is not ont the list this weekend and neither is cooking, I'm getting me pizza!).  Aaaaahhhh! I'm so happy.  But let it rest on the book that this should not be repeated until the next 6 months, I don't want it to be a custom because then being all alone in the house will be boring and it will suck.   Funny thing is that as soon as my boyfriend walked out the door, I grabbed my bag and went straight to Blockbuster to rent me the movies. I was thinking to myself, if someone sees me right now that I'm looking at movies to rent everybody will think "poore woman, she's alone on a weekend and the only company she's got is her VCR, poore her more so because she doesn't have a DVD player"  While I was driving to blockbuster I was trying to decide what kind of movie to rent, so I was in between the comedy movies and horror movies, then suddenly XXX movies popped on my mind, I thought "No Yoli, you should not watch porn movies, it's not right, what will everybody in the shop think, what will the cashier think?". So I just voted for the horror gender; good choice, when I went to the cashier I had my 4 movies on hand ready to go and the little boy doing his job correctly asked my name, address, and all the details he could find in the system, god knows why! After making sure it was me who was taking the movies home he then proceeded to say out loud the name of each movie I was taking (have on note it was still early and there were 3 flies 4 children and 2 adults plus the employees inside the shop so every little whisper could be heard), it was the most embarassing moments of my life because I was thinking and saying to myself "Yoli, this is the best choice you have made ever".  Imagine what could have happened if I decided for porn movies and went directly to the XXX section. Now repeat the cashier scene again. Yeeeah!   If that was going to be the case I would have made sure I never put one step on that store again.  Hope you enjoy your weekend as much as I will enjoy mine. *winks*

      Things could not get any worst…  I woke up this morning with a flirty mood, oh yes! Lil’o Yoli wanted to wear nice jeans with new shirt and pretty shoes and a great hair look. Well, it was the very first time I was going to straight my hair all by myself, so I got my hair dryer and my brand new round brush and there she went; everything was doing ok until I reached the back of my head, this is so difficult, I could not see where my brush was and I could not see where the hair dryer was pointing the super hot air, and as I was making strokes with my brush and my dryer was “in place” I smelled something similar to burned chicken feathers and I could feel my head getting very hot. The immediate reaction was to keep the brush and the dryer away and see what happened, the only thing I could see was the brush with tiny burnt curly hair with a bit of smoke, I thought it would be one hair that maybe flew inside the dryer and got burned so I didn’t pay much attention to it.   So I finished straightening my hair and it looked great from the front, and I wanted to check the back of my head to see if it was the same way. When I turned the mirror to the back of my head I saw lots and lots of little white hair all curled up, when I touched them they felt rough; I just saw myself on the mirror and the “Oh Shit!” expression popped on my face, I BURNT MY HAIR! So not only do I have a color on my hair that I don’t like, but now, my hair is burnt; what’s up with this???  I spent 15 minutes of extra time which meant 20 minutes of being stuck in traffic on the way to work which meant I was late trying to cut the tiny curly burnt parts of hair from the back of my head that in the first place I could not even see very well because I didn’t have my glasses on and my hair is too short to have it brought to the front to cut it. I got so desperate that I preferred to leave it as it was and go to work, but I’m the kind of person that if something is not right I don’t stop teasing until it’s right so I couldn’t resist going to the ladies room with scissors on hand and ready to cut the whole thing, and if it was necessary I would turn bald.  Well I can’t say now how bad it’s, but at least most parts of the burnt  hair are gone, just I don’t want to see my hair stylist face when he sees my hair all chunked in different sizes, man!, he’s gonna kick my ass I know.  Now the “Chipmunks” from the office next door (the buyers) “Chip N’ Dale” (these two girls will never stop talking, mocking or arguing, they’re so annoying) were walking behind me on the office hallway, and all I could hear their mock and giggle as I was walking away. I know they were mocking me because as soon as I walked over they stopped and walked behind me and started laughing. How rude is that!? I hope Donald Duck has better luck this time so he catches both and sends them to the moon with a rocket.   At least something good will happen this afternoon; I finally got the job offer from that company yesterday afternoon, so Part 2 of the story is almost finished, I will go sign the job proposal and submit my resignation letter to my boss on Monday. Woo hoo!, how cool is that? Now that is something to celebrate and mock at those chipmunks, they’re stuck here in this joint with “Cruela Devile” (their boss).   BUNCH’O LOSERS!!!

      When will this ever end?  Today the staff met and interviewed our new “prospect” of General Manager. To begin with, when I first heard the name “Kakarelis” I was not feeling enthusiastic about answering my new boss’s phone like this: “N. Kakarelis office, good morning this is Yoli”. Hell no! Super duper Hell no! If I’m gonna have a boss under the name Kakarelis, first I will throw myself out of a building, how denigrating, how low.   Sorry to say this, but those who have a funny name should not even have a place like an executive office, you know why? Because we mock! Yes, we mock, a lot. And don’t give me no speech about how to respect anybody’s name and roots, because I have a funny last name too and I know how it is and what it feels like to be mocked at because your last name sounds funny or rhymes with something. To me they always call me Jolly Rancher, Yoliland, Yo’ Lee! And my last name always has to be changed into something morbid or pornographic or grotesque or dirty, but what can I do, Right? The only difference is I don’t have to be talking to people or have to know my complete name, on the other hand, General Managers always deal with lots of people, and well the mock can’t be hidden.   Good for me, all the staff gave their thumbs down to this midget, oh because besides the funny name he could be confused with a dummy, that’s because the guy is too short, with a big head and very dark and thick eyebrows and lashes. That was close.  Still, tomorrow we will meet our second “prospect” of General Manager, we’ll see how that comes out, at least the last name is decent.  Hopefully I won’t be here to see the whole transition process all over again, in a way is very…traumatizing.  Oh well,   Happy Humpday everyone.

      The Saga continues…  Yes, finally, I made it!!! All those interview are over!…So what’s next?  As every story in every book all the endings have to finish either in a tragic way or every body likes to read in a happy ending. Well let me tell you something, although my interview saga is over it did not have a happy ending, why? Oh I’ll tell you why. I got lost in the middle of nowhere and if I did not plan everything to be there 1 hour ahead of time it would have been disastrous and I would’ve never made it to that interview, I’ll tell you that!.  Fortunately my savior, yes my boyfriend came along with me, he could see my sad puppy face looking at him while I was telling him on Friday I had to go to San Marcos for the last interview and he had compassion over me so he reported sick from work and drove me all the way over there.  Everything seemed so on time, so perfect so unreal that I thought this was unreal and in fact, it was unreal. We crossed the border in less than 40 minutes, the traffic was perfect, in fact, there was no traffic at all, damn, everything was all good, but just when you think you made it, ah, there had to be a fly in that soup! I wrote down the driving directions and I didn’t notice I jumped one step where we were suppose to turn right to get the correct avenue to the industrial park, well, we went all the way straight, and yes, we past a long, long, very long way until the road finished and I never saw the freaking turn, and of course we were never going to see it because the turn was never in the driving directions because lil’o Yoli forgot to write that part. Oh well, we went back, and looked, and went back again and looked, and well, I was all hysterical and my boyfriend almost choking me because it was 10:20 and the appointment was at 10:30 and we still didn’t find that damn avenue!!!. Finally, my boyfriend said, “what if we turn this way and start looking for the building numbers it will be faster” and yes, he was right! In less than 5 minutes we were there; of course I was 15 minutes late and my phone was not working in that area how was I able to report myself lost?  I really owe that day to my boyfriend if it wasn’t for him I would have never made it. I could see myself driving in that place I’ve never been before in my life and looking for that street, I would have stopped in the middle of the road and cried, oh yes I would.   The interview was good, the guy squeezed my brain all he could but at least I felt he liked me, until the $ question arose:   Interviewer:  So, I am looking at all the comments from the rest of the staff but I haven’t seen here your salary or what you wish to get from this company.    My inner self:  Yep, I thought that too, show me the money!   Me:  Well…   Interviewer:  How much are your earnings then?   Me:  $   Interviewer:  And that is…monthly? Dollars? Pesos?   My inner self : What you think that’s too much for you or what? Why you looking at me funny? Stop looking at me funny!   Me : Weekly    Interviewer:  And how much would you like to receive from this company?   Me : 40% more, or negotiable.   Interviewer:  And why 40%? Because it sounds nice?   My inner self:  If we are talking about sound, how does 200% more sound to you Dwarf?   Me:  (I gave a presidential speech which I will not post here because it’s too long and too damn boring)   Interviewer:  Well, yes, because I have read all your files and well looks like nobody has ever touched the subject about the salary we are offering here and what is the use of dragging you all the way over here if maybe you don’t like our offer right?   My inner self:  Oh now you tell me, if you told me that in the first place I would not be coming here waking up at 6 am dragging my boyfriend to come with me and getting lost in a place where you’re a cell phone is useless for emergencies…damn you’re so ugly!!   Me : Yes, I figured the same…   Interviewer:  So you never spoke to anybody about salaries?   My inner self:  If you can translate my facial expression what in hell do you think, midget?   Me:  No, until now that you brought it up   Interviewer : Wow, that’s strange   My inner self:  Oh come on!    Me : Yes, it is.  So the end of the story is, this company will contact me after the feedback and they will try to make an offer after that and see if I accept or not. Now if you ask me, I don’t think they’ll call me back; just think, what is a Director Assistant trying to look for a position of a Production Manager clerk? It’s a matter of using logic here. If I sent my resume for the General Manager’s assistant position, why then suddenly they are sending me over to the Production manager? Do I have to assume the salary is higher there than the original request? I don’t think so.   This Story of course has a second part, which will be until I receive a phone call with the job proposal which I think it will be either tomorrow or if they want to make me suffer they will call me next week.   In the mean time, I’ll keep posting blogs about my current crappy job where the restrooms look worst than a cheap movie theater restroom and you have to wait in line because there are only 2 toilets for 150 ladies here. Yes, it sounds incredible but it’s true, the toilets don’t last clean for more than 2 minutes and right after the first 2 women use the restroom they are left “unusable”.    WHERE’S THE FREAKIN’ LYSOL???.!!!

      It really sucks to be the Assistant to the Directory of the company you work for...  This job is the worst job ever! (socially speaking). The last time I had a nice social relationship with my coworkers was a year ago, right before my Boss got fired, after that I became bitter.  What is the relation between being the Boss's assistant and not being able to socialize nicely with anybody? Do I look that intimadating? I don't think so!.  I remember back when I started working for a real company that looking at the Director's assistant was like looking at the "Venus of the Nile". Those nice looking girls with high heels and expensive clothes, expensive shoes, expensive make up and expensive haircuts were very impressing to me, but often the people around would say the Director's assistant was a "witch". I don't consider myself a witch (at least I don't look like one).  Working as the Director's assistant for 5 years now really is not all that and a bag of chips, on the contrary, it really is alot of responsibilities and yes!, I have to act like a bitch, not a witch, a bitch, and being bitchy is not easy, most if you were not born to be a bitch, but what can we assistants do?   If nobody in this company liked me before, because as I said one time all the "women parrots" in this company looked at me like a weird specimen, after acting really bitchy with everybody due to "management change" and my new boss requires a "Hulk" by his side to assist him. Well guess who has to be that "Hulk"? Everybody will end up liking me less. So I guess I earned it right? And now I have to pay for it, Heck! I think I've been paying for it ever since I started working in this joint so called "company" 6 months ago. The only people who half speak to me are men plus one married manager with children who is "secretly harassing me" (gross!).  My punishments for being the Director's assistant are:  1.- I have to stare at the monitor doing nothing and acting as I am working when I really have nothing to work on instead of going to the department next to me and have a little chit chat with the group or sneak around other departments just to say hello to everybody like everybody does here.  2.- Not be invited to any company group events because I am the bitch in the house which really sucks! (I wouldn't go anyway but still is nice to know you're invited somewhere)  3.- Stare at the window looking people passing on the street which having lunch.  4.- My only friend at lunch breaks is a book that I almost finish (that reminds me I have to get another book)

      This is the very last time I eat something my boyfriend makes About two months ago my boyfriend made a typical persian dish with lamb meat. I don't like lamb meat (wost if it's frozen). When I first took it out of the topper ware it smelled weird (like sheep), *ugh*, still as I am the kind of person who eats food even if it's not eatable I tried, and I couldn't I had to puke it, it was really bad.  Today the same story happened, this time with the same dish but with beef meat, I had to choose every little bit of meat from the put along with the vegetables so I could not put any grease in my lunch dish. Still, it didn't get better. Again I could not eat it, I tried, and I couldn't, the taste was tasteless. So now I have something to be punished about by the omnipresent, but I think even the omnipresent would not eat my boyfriend's food, it's too damn bad!.  Poor guy, he's really nice and tries to make me feel comfortable and happy by making lunch for the next day but definitely is no helping my stomach. I had to put my dish away and just fill myself up with a bag of Dorito's, two oranges and one apple, that was exactly 5 hours ago, now again I am hungry, I just ate a few pretzels and I'm still hungry. Bleah!. I wonder if he eats what he makes...I don't think so.  The "G" was torturing over the phone, with the image of a juicy burger or a sandwich. Agh!, Good thing it's 5:00 pm, now I can go and eat.  Damn I'm so hungry!  By the way, I had a workload yesterday that it was so long since I said the word "work", so I have nothing interesting to say, work is never interesting, is always a boring subject.  Gone for Lunch/Dinner.

      What I have done is the worst experiment ever since I removed my eyebrows for the first time. You know, I always color my hair because at my 24 years of age I have white hair already and well, it makes me look older; so usually I use a burgundy color, pretty neat; I’ve used it now for about 6 years and as I always get tired of the same looks, I always change what ever is changeable, so yesterday I changed the color of my hair to bluish black.   The Results:   Oh! The pain!, The Agony!, The frustration!, The desperation and need of grabbing a machine and cut my hair right thru the scalp, irrigates my own!.   At this moment, I wished my hair was a wig so I could bleach it back to the color it had before with no damage. I regret (and I never regret anything, but now I do!) of ever thinking that black would fit me…I was wrong!…So wrong I was!…Too…Damn Wroooonnng!…  >Silence >Deep Breath  Next plan is, today, I am buying my regular bottle of burgundy color and re-color my hair in two weeks. I’ll just have to stick with my black hair and I’ll try not to look at myself in the mirror more than 2 seconds. And it’s not just me who didn’t like it, everybody in the office didn’t like it, they asked me with a face like they were looking at Pepe Le Pew passing by in front of them:    Office Monkeys : “Did you color your hair?”  Me : Duh! No, my hair changes color depending my mood and weather conditions…Of course I did color it!!!…Can’t you smell the ammonia impregnating your nostrils?!. Foo!.  My boyfriend saw me last night and I got the same reaction from him as I did from myself, but he was sweeter, he said it looked ok, but he liked the other color better.   So by anonymous votes, I am changing my color back to the old burgundy color. And no more blacks for me, I mean, I can use any red I’d like, hell! Even I can use blondish colors but black…No!   Moral of the story:    I should follow the instructions in the box before use (i.e. make a test area first and if I like it I keep it, if I don’t, I leave it, that way I won’t have the desire of taking off my scalp and replace it with the girl’s next office scalp as I do right now).   The End.

      It’s amazing how I can get distracted so easily…  Yesterday I had a **“get together with the boyfriend’s/room mate/friend/ or what ever family” day out which I always find extremely boring. 3 sisters and 2 brothers along with 2 nephews and one brother in law are ready to go to “Point Loma”.   ** All these concepts due to one discussion we had Saturday morning, trying to define my current situation with…my boyfriend/room mate/friend/or what ever he wants to be called, (the definition is not yet “defined”)  So as everybody is getting in like sardines inside an old van I’m thinking on the way what am I going to do, right? Well, fortunately for who, one sister in law knows a bit of English and she wants to make a conversation, so just imagine me and her trying to communicate; it’s very nice and sweet of her trying to make me feel comfortable around a family of  Non-English speaking foreigners. She tries to tell me something about her son who got married and stuff and as we speak, you know we are all tight together so when I was looking at her face I was seeing double, so to get out of the embarrassing faces I was making in front of her (imagine me twisting my eyes to the center of her nose to a distance no longer than 5 inches) I had to change my eye directions everywhere except her nose, but she was so close to me I could see all the defects in her face, so as I was trying to find a spot on her face to stare at to not force my eyes (thinking it would be not polite to just turn my face away while she talks) I found a “huge” black head on her nose, damn!, I got fascinated by the size of that black head the only thing I could think about was to squeeze it…  Yeah, I wanted to squeeze that black head all the way till the end! I could see myself doing it, the image would not go away!!!, it was insane!!!. The need and desire of popping up that black head was more than I could bear, the Squeezy feeling was taking over me!  I don’t know if she ever noticed I was only staring at her black head and was not even paying attention to her conversation, well it didn’t matter anyway because I could not understand a word she was saying to me, I just kept nodding my face like an idiot while that black head was like a magnet calling my eyes and my thoughts.   Finally she stopped talking; maybe then she knew, I was really not paying attention, so she turned her face away from me, and until then, I was released from the curse of the black head!

      whoah!!...  I was just thinking.  I hope I don't have frogs, and crickets and the pest and what ever other "plages" in the bible were mentioned because if I do, I'm freaking out...I'm serious...I'll lock myself in a mental hospital to never get out. For sure, no animals, insects, flies, frogs, etc. will get inside my locked room right?...Oh my god, I better start finding out if those hospitals have pest controls and desinfectants, and bug sprays and I'll ask if the fumigate often...yeah...that's what I'll do...  Ok I'll go now.

      I was talking to my best friend yesterday who I will now call the "G", (stop thinking of names that start with G, first, her name does not start with G so cut it, G is  short for a nickname "girlfriend"...ailright?) about how my home became like a biblical passage when it mentions something about "the plagues" because I've been suffering alot of that during my life.  First, back around 18 years ago my house got infested with mice, it was terrible because we were never able to get rid of those disgusting creatures until we moved out of the house.  Then, 3 years after that, my house got infested with fleas (we used to have a cat that we never noticed he sneaked out of the house at night and came back in the morning and filled with fleas), again, it took my beautiful mother a whole week to get rid of those horrible things, in the mean time well, we were all bitten and the cat just had to be dumped somewhere out and far from our home.   Thank the omnipresent, the "damned plague" disappeared for another 10 years, but then, we got infested with fleas again (we had another cat that used to sneak out of the house and infested our house with fleas), so, this time it had to be me the one who had to get rid of the fleas, and it took me 5 cans of bug spray.   1 year later, the fleas came back, (this time I had it, again I had to dump my cat nearby a baseball field so that someone could adopt it...Sorry, maybe the animal control will sue me for saying this but...take this...I don't live in the US so...Eat that!).  A few months later, I had ant infestation in my kitchen, (not that I am a dirty person, you can ask the "G" and she will tell you I am a clean freak...can't live without clorox!!) there's a ground filled with dirt in the back of my kitchen that is always messy because of the dirty neighbors, so there, I had to be the one paying for the damage because I live in the ground floor; it took me 2 cans of bugspray to eliminate the last tiny bitty piece of ant there was left in the house (or maybe even in the block of the street).  I thought I was "bug free" until last christmas, I saw little animals on my bed, I thought, this is the punishment for being so bad and not liking children!!..NOOOOOO!!!. Oh well, it took me several weeks before I could find out from where those tiny animals were coming from, because every morning I saw a bunch of those on my bed; I moved my bed upside down one night, I took off my blankets, covers, even I opened the mattress to see if there was something inside, pillows the same, floors, walls, and nothing!, I could not see the source. Well, the thought came to me like it fell down from heaven, as I was thinking of where, how and when did this infestation happened, I looked up my ceiling and thought, "I checked everything except the ceiling...why not give it a try?", so there you see me getting on the bed and with one can of bug spray I sprayed the entire ceiling, and boala!!!!, all those little tiny insects began to fall down one after another, there were hundreds of them, (yuk! just thinking about it just gives me the chills). How can you imagine you will have infestation of little animals even on your ceiling...this is ridiculous!!.  And still I thought I was saved?...well no!...just a week ago, as the season began to bloom the flowers and all those little spring season insects coming in, now I am infested with fruit flies!!...THIS IS IT!....I had it!....I cannot take it any longer!!...What have I done to deserve such horrible punishment???...  This is the hardest most annoying pest I've had ever since the flea infestation, because these are flies, they fly, and you can't catch those unless you keep chasing one by one and kill each of them! (I already tried that and it didn't work, just two days ago, I sprayed each and ever little fruit fly I found where ever I walked by in the house, I finished one can of bug spray and the freaking insects are still here!!!!).  So there!, this means, I cannot live without my bug spray, I have to keep it with me in case I need it, it's like the Mastercard but this one is "Raid...don't live in your home without it"...aaggghhh!!!!  I hope this fruit fly soon die...Die you freaks!!!..Die!!!

      Today, is not a happy day for me, (I’m depressed  >_  Last night I didn’t get any sleep, (if you call 2 hours of sleep sleeping then yes I slept), there’s a reason for that, I’m not an insomniac at all, in fact, I sleep like a log once my head hits the pillow, but reminiscing about 6 years ago, all of my nice sleeping went away to become history (this is why I look 30 when I am only 24).  It all started back when I had my first and only love, oh yes, it was magically delicious when it started, then after 4 years it became hell, then I couldn’t sleep, I had big arguments with my ex about who gets the most attention and who gets left out with no attention (that would be me complaining and the marathon would last all night).   Well I thought this would all end once I ended the relationship (this should be exactly 2 years ago), but then something worst came along. I got hooked up with another “semi-serious” relationship (this one is interesting because it all happened so quickly I don’t remember even how it all began), oh what a mistake! (believe me), someone should teach us girls when you end up a disastrous sick long relationship you should never…ever…hook up immediately with someone else, this should take it’s recovery time properly, but Noooooo!, Yoli felt alone and out of place, with no one to love her and no one to be beside her, (just my cat that paid attention to me only when it was hungry…*bleh*).   I was a happy gal for about 4 or 5 months (can’t recall, I was too busy acting like a Ho’ after my break up) after I broke up with my ex, my best friend always came along with me to take care of me and also so she could have fun of course; I made a mess out of myself; but then, I met “Him”, by “coincidence”, nothing serious, just a “hello, how are you” ( and all that crap that comes after that), well then one night the “unimaginable” happened, we kissed, we slept together, and now, after 11 months of going out we are “living” together “temporally”, “nothing serious” (This was 6 months ago). I thought, “Well, I guess it should be fun, the other guy was never there when I needed him the most and at least this guy is here with me so, what the heck!” (right?…wrong!…so…so…wrong!)   The problem of living with someone is that you start to feel like there is a commitment (that would be me, the committed Yoli) when there really isn’t one because there’s nothing tying you to the person you are living/sleeping with (that would be “Him”, the uncommitted “Him”), but at the same time if you “love” that someone, the commitment “automatically appears” in the relationship (right? … of course is right, why shouldn’t it be?… right?).  So the living/sleeping together thingy with someone made me ponder of the “Pros” and “Cons”.  The nicest things of living with someone is:  1.  You wake up every morning with someone by your side giving you little       kisses and saying “Good Morning baby”  2.  You fix dinner and lunch for 2 (not your cat and you, it’s you and “that       someone” now), plus you don’t eat with the TV on, you have someone to       talk to while you’re eating.  3.  You have someone to talk to when someone made you angry at work or        something nice happened to you in the day. That way you won’t look like       a “weirdo” when you’re talking to your pet (in my case cat) about your       things in life and your pet just…meows/barks at you.  4.  You play around with “that someone” in the supermarket while you’re       buying groceries for both. It makes it more fun, plus that avoids you to       wonder around the isles just looking for fattening munchies to eat when       you’re depressed, because depression simply is not there.   5.  You get to have sex 6 nights out of seven (or least a quickie), so you       don’t need your special toys for your intimate entertainment. 6.  After a day end, you get to use “that someone” as a pillow when you put       your head over that someone’s chest right before you go to sleep.  The ugliest things about living with someone when “that someone” is “Not” there:  1.  Knowing that you are living with someone and that someone doesn’t show       up at a decent time to at least see your face before you take off your       make up and put your “favorite” jammies. That way “that someone”       will “remember” how pretty you are when you don’t have drawl all over       your face and your hair has the mark of the pillow on one side of your       head.  2.  Knowing you’re living with someone and the last time you saw “that       someone” was Sunday night, now it’s been three consecutive days and         you still haven’t seen “that someone” but you know “that someone”       comes to sleep every night because you can feel the “bulk” pushing you to       the edge of the bed with your butt freezing because most of the blankets       are covering the “bulk”.  3.  Something great happened to you today and you want to run home and       tell “that someone”, oh! Forgot that someone comes home “late”, so you       just call your best friend to catch up with the great things that happened       to both.  4.  It’s Friday night, you want to go party/dancing/dining/etc., it’s 9:00 pm        and “that someone” is “Not” yet home, you’re getting sleepy, 10 minutes       later, you fell asleep.  5.  You just watched a very horny movie in HBO, you decide to take a       shower, wear something sexy and wait for “that someone” to eat from       head to toes; 20 minutes later, the fever cools off, and the only thing       you’re thinking about is wearing something warm and fall asleep.   6.  You need help, you car broke, you have a headache/you had food       poisoning/diarrhea/etc. who you gonna call? ... yup!, you better call the       Ghost Busters ‘cause your “someone” is at the family house having       dinner, solving family problems or just catching up on yesterday’s family       news and he/she aint coming to the rescue.  In conclusion, I think I ended up in the same situation I ran out from 6 years ago, and the whining and arguing and complaining about “that someone” not been there when you need it has me sleepless every time I touch the subject.  In analysis, one of two things I will have to do to if I still want to look 30 when I reach 30 or better yet 35:  a.  I break up with “that someone” and look for another “someone”; that who       knows, maybe will end up better, the same or even worst, or,  b.  I stop whining about “that someone” not being there so I can rest in my      sleep.   According to my “psyque”, I won’t do (a) because, I have feelings for the guy, besides looking at it from the cold side of things, he helps me pay the rent; and (b) would be a good choice… for now, but eventually I will get back to the whining, and complaining. So, I won’t do either of those. As a result, most probably I will end up looking like 45 when I reach 30. Looking at it from the bright side, in appearance I will look as old as my b/f.  Then End.

      Yep, this is how I've been all day, and I mean all day! Well it turned out I don't have sinus as I thought before, it's just that my boogers were so stuck to my nose they couldn't get out; so there!, as of now I am declared with flu, no doubt about it. I didn't have such bad flu since last year, I think it was already time my germs got out and have a little bit of fun over me right?, so to let it be free, I let my flu virus be as it is, with no medication, no cough syrups or anything that should be good to prevent my flu.  Run germs, run and discover new systems to attack!!!...  Yeah!, I already spread my germs all over the second floor (that's where I am at, located at the perfect place, in the hallway...muuaaahahah). I sneezed in the Purchasing Mgr's. office, I coughed in the Buyer's office (that's a good blank, they're about 7 bodys ready to be germinized), and cought and sneezed at my neighbor, the general controller and his assistant (I'm sorry about that, really didn't mean it, I like those guys...really but I couldn't help it...sorry).   So I am just waiting for...I don't know what, I should be home by now it's friday afternoon, everybody came in late this morning except for me, I was the first one in the office (don't I deserve a little bit of credit for that?) but noooo, Yoli had to take half of wednesday off and now because I feel bad I don't want to leave early today, but this time I am sick, I can harly speak, I can hardly breath and I can hardly read what I am typing (that means I am a responsible woman *tee hee*).  I am preparing for my super dooper weekend, yep yep, my plans are sleeeppp, and rest...yeeshh!. Tonight I want to put my PJ's very early (right after I finish cleaning my bathroom, it's messy), make some popcorn and watch a good program (I don't like to watch movies much, they seem so unreal), maybe the discovery channel or discovery health, or maybe the national geographic channel or something with blood included, yeah!. (J/K).  Excuse me for being so lame today but as I told my best friend, my brain feels like a big booger and I have no idea....what?, i think I saw a huge fly flying around my head (can't tell if it's real or just imagination)   Go away fly!!!.  Tomorrow I have appt. with Mr. Doctor, oh yesh! you thought this Saga was over, well you were wrong, the continue of "Meeting Mr. Doctor's" still on, tomorrow at 1:30 pm (PST), I am just waiting for my final results after my final tests, I hope it's nothing serious and it was just a little thing that will cause me no harm in the future (yeah right! with my luck...I don't think so); I just hope he doesn't have to open my bladder in two. *yikes*. My dear boyfriend is coming with me (like he has a choice) after that I just want to go home and rest my flu. Oh this flu!!...why?? why flu?..you just came in two moths ago, you messed me up and here you are again giving me more trouble! (yeah I'm a little bit upnormal when I get sick of the flu, usually I just stay in bed for a couple of weeks because I get chronic bronchitis..ain't that beautiful?).  I think I've stayed in my "work" place for too long now, I'll just pretend I came in at 8?, so I'll just leave at 4, that's pretty fair no, look at all the buyer's they came in at 8, today is "buyer's day out at The Attic" so they're probably leaving at 5:00 pm which means they've only worked for 9 hours, excluding lunch break and oh how can I forget? "Friday Breakfast Slam Jam" in the cafeteria room. So that should be 7 hours of work less the play time, ok, 3 hours of work. Which reminds me of something....  There's this girl in the Purchasing Dept. which I don't know why I simply dislike, we'll call her "Puebla" because that's where she's from. So Puebla comes in at about 8 am every day, with her daily extravagant "I woke up late and I am running late for work and I am not going to take a shower because is late so I'll just hold my hair into a badly made bun because I don't have time to spray some gel on it because as I said before I'm late for work" hair do, wearing a typical and very simple tshirt (which to my personal opinion I would only wear on weekends in house and on laundry days or when I am cleaning up my house or simply when I didn't take a shower days),jeans you know, the ones that have loose strings in the bottom of the jeans like they were very old (or maybe hers are really old) and a pair of red snikkers...oh yeah forgot to say although I don't think I need to say...with no make up. She's the popular girl in the dept. because she's very social and stuff...(hhmm whatever) so she spends the whole day on the phone laughin, or joking, or just eating, everything you can think of but not working. So This morning her boss (a very mean lady...she's a 43 year old smart ass squitzofrenic single woman) asks "P" to give her a feedback on some thing that "P" should have been working on earlier in the day, and "P" replies (with her really really ugly spoken english)  "I no have time to check it now "....I could not resist myself laughin at that answer when a few minutes ago I heard her playing around with the other buyers and talking about some picnic they're planing for easter weekend (but she doesn't have time to work).   So for this reason, I am leaving early, oh yes I am, it's 4:25 pm and I am sick, I just felt someone turned the A/C on when right now it's raining outside!, I can't believe this...(you see now why I hate my job?). AGrrr!!..  Ok, too much bad vibe in this blog, you all don't deserved it, I don't know how many read my posts but still, thank you.  So I'll just leave it for now and will continue on Monday, hope everybody a nice weekend and stuff. (this reminds me one time on Christmas eve, there is this Manager I know who right before the christmas shut down told me,  "well I'll see you next year so I wish you all those nice things and stuff".... huh?....good!, he didn't specify what so that should be good right?)  Anyhow, it's 4:30 so I should be heading off now.   *Assheee!!!*

      Yesterday I had to take half of day off, my weekend was a little bit odd, I had this strange pain all over my face even all my tooth hurt and I could feel the inside of my skull burning hot, this is completely new for me, I've never had such weird pains before; so I check the internet for the simptoms and looks like I have a Sinus problem (when did that happen?), I thought Sinus only came from people who like to smoke and have big nostrals (well I was wrong) I have a small nose and very small nostrals and look at me I have sinus *blah*.  My new boss is so neat, I told him about my miserable pain and that I needed to go home early and rest but before I had to finish his report due for that day at noon, well as all of us Mexicans are, we are told to do something at a specific time for example tuesday at 9 am (Mexican translation means tuesday at...sometime between noon"ish" or maybe later...depending how I feel and if I like you, you might have it) there I was, me with my "face pain" waiting for the last mexicano manager to give me his report due since 9 am and it was 10:45 am and I still was there....waiting...and waiting...and waiting...and waiting some more. My dear boss looks at me and asked me:   Boss:  "weren't you going to leave "early"?,   Me : yes, but I'm still waiting for MM to give me his report  Boss : don't worry, give me what ever you have, and tell this guy to give me his report whenever he's ready, go home and get rest, you look miserable.   Me:  Thank you! (the song of Aleluya and the sight of the 16th chappel appeared upon me)  Next thing before I left he started telling me all these weird stories about his friend who had sinus and had to go under surgery and it was painful....  I ran away asking the onmipresent these stories are not my case.  Today I am leaving with a strange sensation, my boss told me something weird about the japaneese, I hope is true, he told me he lived in Japan a few years; my boss told me that everybody that has the flu wears a surgical mask because the crowded masses are "germofobics"; japaneese don't use toilets, (they think that putting your butt where someone else put its but is nasty) instead, they just have a big hole on the ground where you have to drop your messy things (easy for men, pretty darn difficult for women).  Imagine this, women would make a contest of who hits the bullseye in the hole and who ever does it is the queen. Just like spitting contests in the mensroom right?. *sight*.  Have to run, it's 5:00 pm, boss is out of town for the next week...me going home, me going to rest, me going to have party while the boss is out...wee!

      Oh the happiness of having a day off makes this cold rushed day a beautiful day...  Alarm No. 1 went on at 4:30 am and I thought it was alarm No. 2 so I got out of bed in one jump and about to rush to the bathroom to take my shower I remembered alarm No. 2 had not yet rang besides the fact that it was still dark...I scared away my sleep but I got to get to sleep 5 minutes before my alarm turned on...  Bleah!  At alarm No. 2 I thought we were already on saturday morning so I kept looking at my alarm clock and asking myself..."what day is it today? Yesterday was wednesday? or was it thursday? isn't it friday already?" (took me 5 minutes to realize it was still a working day and I had to take my tooshie on the shower). Well now that I knew it was Friday I was happy; knowing it would be my last day of work made me feel new and young again, until I saw the time and it was 20 minutes before 8...I was running late.  Well actually I could not run at all because everybody else decided they were running late also, so the traffic became unberable; despite the fact that there wre 2 old cars and 2 old vans infront of me and they didn't let me go ahead..."Yo' the guy with the old van!..oh...sorry ma'am...the one with the old van..MOOOOVEE IT!!! Someone has to go to work today and it's ME!" (Of course the woman could not listen to me because I had my windows down and she was 3 cars ahead of me...boo hoo). So thanks to the lady with the old van I was 15 minutes late, which means I have to leave 15 minutes later after work...yuck!  But thank the omnipresent I'm at work, blogging while I get some rest before I start digging the reports I have due for...right now...but hey! It's friday, my boss is not here yet and will come back until one hour from now, there's no rush is it? ...Nah!  I've been eating by myself again, something happened after one girl in administration resigned last tuesday that now everybody goes everywhere except the lunch room. Oh well, it doesn't matter, I still have my book to read (damn book, it has me hooked I tell ya' hooked!), but not today, I'm going out for lunch with one of my friends who works at the building right next to mine, this is so cool.   I haven't described my new work...it goes a little something like this:  It's a big building with lots and lots of trees, (yep, I am buying my very own bug spray because I can tell there will be a lot of spiders here), palm trees, all kinds of trees, it's not all done yet but it's half way completed. It has one big cascade infront of front desk but still is not working yet because is not yet completed either...well actually the building is not yet finished, it still has some things that need to be done. I told you that my building is like a maze, now I don't get lost, Yeah I know where all those little doors go to, now I know that the second door from the main door to the left is the ladies room, (cause twice I got into the mens room and once to the janitors room...that's embarassing).   The production offices are inside the production area, mine is the main production office where the printers, faxes and copiers are, there are two empty cubicles and I'm the only one without one (I knew this would happen), I have 3 doors, one in the front of my desk, one in the back of my desk and one beside my desk, and one BIG window right next to my computer, so there's no where to hide myself, oh and I forgot the camera that I have right across the production area that keeps looking at me funny, well, I don't know if it's looking at me funny or not but I feel is looking at me funny.   So there you have it folks, I should have eyes like those little animals that change color and move their eyes in different directions one from the other and I should have a mirror, and one big blind next to my window, cause if I move my monitor in any side, you can still look at it, where has all my privacy gone???  But it doesn't matter you know, most of the time I have my boss sitting next to me telling me how to do these reports and where to look at if there is a problem and all that sort of stuff, I'm learning new things in here which keep me entertained all day, and I love the fact that I don't have a minute even to breathe, oh that is so exciting! (I'm serious, I'm not being sarcastic)  I can't wait to have all my place settled and everything in order to then go where the action is, the production area. We make water sprinklers here so they have to be tested and run a 100% before they are sent to the customer and guess with what do they have to be tested?...Yes! with water, there are 6 water testers and lots and lots of sprinklers to test...I want to test water sprinklers!!!

      This is what happens to me when I try to be like everybody else...  Yesterday I tried to post my profile but it didn't work, so this morning I decided to navegate around my blog to see what was wrong with it, obviously because I had not updated my template so I decided to change it...Oh what a big mistake, not did I just lost all my comments I also lost all my links! The comments I guess they're ok if they get lost till a certain point but when it happens like me that I save those comments for future reference like adding new people to my blog oooh now there comes the problem, well, if any of my readers don't see themselves in my link list don't feel bad, I am just so dumb that I thought everything would be saved if I changed my template, so actually all those links are thanks to two or three of the blogs I have visited for so long, the rest I had to steal them from Jenn...  Thanks Jenn! :)  Tomorrow when I have more time, because today I got blank, I will tell you about my nice trip to work, oh yes, it is one of those days when everything goes wrong with you and at the end you are late, so late that you get all rushed so rushed that everything goes wrong, so wrong that you have to do things more than 5 or 6 times to get it right but at the 6th time you feel all dizy from looking at all those little numbers that you get confused...Yep, that happened to me this morning.  But I'll just tell you the little thing that happened to me at the gas station.  I was running late for work, it was 7:45 am and I had to be there at around 7:50 because we are having visitors today. Yesterday I was supposed to fill my car with gas but I was really too lazy to go to the gas station (1 block away from my home..ok?) so I thought to go early in the morning on my way out. Well as I was running late I wanted everything to be done ASAP but for my good luck, I had a dispatch man so so so lazy, more lazy than the lazy bear. I waited for him for 1 minute or more and still he was walking with this velocity of a baby turtle, I could really not believe this, still at the end when I was about to pay the guy, I gave him a 50 dollar bill so he could give me a 30 dollar change. He had 3 10 dollar bills in his hand and a bunch of other bills; he counted...  Gasman: 1, 2, 3...oh wait...how much did you wanted?  Me: 20  Gasman: Oh so, 20 less 50..is...  Me: 30, you're suppose to give me 30 back.  Gasman: Oh yeah, 1, 2, 3, ok, 3..or would you like change?  Me: No just give me my change  Gasman: 'Cause I can give you change if you want, I have lots of change, see?  Me: No, I want my 30 back.  Gasman: Ok, 1, 2, 3...(gives me the money) so lady...  Me: I push the gas and boom! go away,  Poor guy, I left him with the words in his mouth, but hey! I WAS RUNNING LATE!  Ok, Gotta go, my goss just got out of his meeting and I know he will come to me again to do some more work...  Thank goodness I'm just 30 minutes away from 6...Yeeeahh!

      You gotta be kidding me…  Since Blogger changed it’s new image I can no longer check blogs from home. This is not nice or pretty or sane.   Yesterday I spent over 1 hour trying to see anything that would look like a blog. Looks like the blogger system doesn’t like me or my computer ‘cause it kept spitting me out of the internet and I had to reboot my computer 3 times (it could have been more but I just gave up at 3).  So there you have it folks, my computer stinks! It can’t hold a little bit of loads because it starts to freak out like a crazy old woman. My computer is much more complicated than its owner (me).  But before that…  I turn on my computer and I found a strange icon with the title “Instant access” I thought this was not in my computer the last time I logged in. I’m not the only one that uses the computer, my boyfriend does it too but I have told him to never download any programs from the internet unless I see what it is (my boyfriend doesn’t know much about computers) and it looks like he didn’t listen to me. Despite the fact that the program was downloaded as soon as I try to log into the internet a login window pops on to me with the title “hot babes instant login” AAHH! Now that’s what is all about! Not only that, but it had an automatic telephone bill charge as soon as you log into the “hot babes” page so even if you don’t what the darn thing you still be charged 1.50 USD a minute…I was about the burst into anger here. I mean I don’t care if my boyfriend looks at porn sites, all men do that, my dad used to do that and I found over 400 pics of  naked lesbos, teens and other stuff so I believe is natural, but what I do care for are the freakin viruses that come along those sites. Hell if I had a virus (whick I think I do, maybe that’s why I can’t log into blogger anymore…I didn’t thought of that) my computer will die for sure, it’s so old and sensitive. I tried to take uninstall the program and guess what? I had to download the uninstall program…I don’t think so, I wanted to do it the right way but that meant to go into that “hot babes” page and get the unsuscribe thingy so I just went into the downloaded programs and deleted the folder; still that didn’t solve my blogger problem. So I search on the cookies and I found the temporary internet files…Oh my goodness!! It was worst than looking under my bed I had over 10,000 temporary internet files with lots and lots and lots of cookies…  Well, the end of it was not pretty at all, I was planning to log into the internet while the meatloaf was done but instead of that I ended up cleaning my computer from “hot babes” and other weird pages I found.   Oh well…guess I’ll have to check the blogs from work, in one way or another, I’ll do it!!! NOBODY IS STOPPING ME!

      No time for anything...I'm going to explode...  I really can't complain, this is what I always dreamed of though but I think this is too much! Hell! I've been working over time since day 1, this can't be good...can it?  Ok so my best friend got angry at me (as I suspected) but everything is back to normal, she read my post and she commented, I haven't read it yet but I think is something baaad, oh well!  Got up early at 6:30 am on Saturday (thing I never thought on doing before) and did all my chores, washed laundry, cleaned house, went to car wash and changed the oil in my car and after that I invited my best friend for breakfast and it was faaabulous! we went around from one little store to another, got me some nice things and at the end of the day I could not feel my feet anymore; doesn't that feel great! After walkign for mover 8 hours straight without sitting down and after buying great bargains. In deed I was happy!  Sunday was good too though, my boyfriend fixed my closet and my night stand cause it was falling apart. My dad fixed it some time ago with lots of duck tape but after 2 years the glue in the duck didn't do much. My boyfriend was laughin about it, so I said "Hey! that's my dad's master piece don't say that". At night we went to see the movie "Troy", highly recommended. Brad Pitt is a hottie!   Now I have to get back to work, I didn't want to let the blog die just like that, oh no! Yoli got lots to say during the week, maybe not every day but sure I'll accumulate it and write it down on a pice of toilet paper, or a napkin or a dirty newspaper or what ever I find and then I'll post it here. When ever I find the time...cause now, I don't have time...I NEED SOME TIME!!!!!  Bleah!

      I never knew about it until I heard about the meaning of the word…  Yesterday I stayed at home all day, didn’t go out anywhere, it was fun, my boyfriend had to work so I just took a shower and went to bed again.  I remembered my boyfriend asked me to write a letter on behalf of her sister the night before to some email address he gave. I turned on the computer and remember I had to wash the dishes, well while the computer started I went to the kitchen to wash the dishes, then I saw the broth that I left from last night was still on the stove so before I started washing the dishes I went to get a tupper ware to put the broth inside so I could leave it inside the fridge, when I opened the fridge I then remembered I promised my boyfriend I would make watermelon water, so I left the tupper inside the fridge and took the watermelon to prepare the water. I forgot that I had to wash my blankets so before I started making the water I went to the bedroom and have the blankets washed while I made the water, washed the dishes and write that letter on the computer.   So there I went to the bedroom and while I was taking the blankets off I saw little itty bitty animals on top of my blankets…huh?… I have pests?? Not again! So I went to the bathroom and took the bug spray, took out the blankets and sprayed the whole ceiling from where the little creatures were falling. The TV was on and there was a program about Natives (I love native documentaries) so I stayed for a while just to watch a bit of the program before I began to work. I remembered in the mean time I didn’t brush my teeth that morning so I went to the bathroom and washed my teeth, I saw the towel was dirty so I went to the cabinet and get a new towel when I saw my file and then I remembered I didn’t file any statements from last week, so I closed the towel drawer and opened the file cabinet and started filing my papers, by then I remembered I forgot that I had to write the letter to my sister in law so I finished filing and went to my bedroom…but I forgot why I did that if I was supposed to go the computer and start typing that letter, but at least I remembered that I haven’t washed my blankets yet and the little animals had to be taken away from the floor, so I take the blankets to the washer room and grabbed my broom, I cleaned the bugs away and went to the kitchen, oh then I remembered I had to wash the dishes and make the watermelon water so I open the fridge to get the watermelon (which was already out) and I saw a rotten banana, eow! I picked it and put in the waste basket for rotten fruit by then I saw the basket was full so I went to the washer room to get a plastic bag, there I remembered I had to was my blankets, so I left the plastic bag (this time I didn’t want to forget doing something else I wasn’t suppose to be doing) and went to the living room and picked the blankets, I saw the computer was still on, Oh! The letter! So I went to the washer and put the blankets, went to the kitchen and made the water, I saw the rotten banana in the kitchen counter and went back to the washer to get the plastic bag, went to kitchen, threw the banana, went to computer and went to my msn.   There, I found two mails from long lost friends and I could not resist in replying to them so I did; found one of my posts in blogger so I decided what was new over there and well, wrote a few comments, and browsed some more; I wanted to write a post but blogger didn’t let me so I browsed my pc to check what was wrong, by then, I was hungry, so went to the kitchen and prepared something to eat, then went back to the computer, I had to go to the kitchen and get a pill but then I saw the washer machine was already done since a very long time ago so I went to the washer room and took my blankets to the dryer; went back to the computer and then I remember I didn’t take my pill so there I went again to the kitchen and I while I was looking for a glass of water I found a bag of cookies, well I took the bag of cookies and went back to the computer..and yep…forgot to take the pills again so I went back to the kitchen and yes I took my pill. But then, I remembered I had to fix lunch for today and I had to leave the computer for a while to fix lunch, that way I thought I would be off pressure and I would have more time to write that letter I promised my boyfriend I would write for her sister.  While fixing lunch I felt hungry again so I ordered sushi for delivery, in the mean time my boyfriend came back from work, I was still drying my blankets that I had ready 3 hours ago; sushi was home so I ate and my boyfriend asked me “Did you write the letter for my sister?” … Uhm!…chom…chom…chom….gloob…”Of course I did” I said. My boyfriend went to the bathroom and while he was there doing his business I logged into the computer and wrote the letter…in less than 5 minutes.  So this means, that something I could have done in 5 minutes it actually took me more than 5 hours to complete…why? I cannot believe how much work I had at home before I could seat down, relax and type a 5 word letter.  Anyway!  I am supposed to be writing a report right now and instead of that I am writing my post…bleah!

      After all these years finally I found people like me...  Ever been to a workplace where you interact with people who has the same ideas like you? Isn't that a great feeling?  I finally feel like I'm in heaven, where a bunch of other Yolis interact with eachother in harmony. Of course it has its own troubles but who cares? I don't, I am where I always wanted to be. The restrooms are very clean, wow they even look like a very fancy restaurant restroom and all those luxuries, very nice, bad thing I have a trauma with germs...I can't go in there! Anyway!   Well, I haven't been able to post as often as I wished, this work is really work, not like the crappy joint I used to be before. Hell! I have been there for a week now and I already stayed over time for 3 days, that's the amount of work I'm getting and we are just starting. The company is huge, 90,000 sq. feet. with only 50 something employees including 14 assemblers in two line operations (this is so tiny). It's a two story building and has a weird shape, so weird I have been lost twice and couldn't find the exit, I felt like a rat inside a maze, creepy! Alright! Enough about work, I need a break!  Forgot to mention, last week when I went to buy the wedding bands for my parents I went to IHOP and had breakfast, then I went to the jewerly store and one girl who is now my work mate found me there and we talked for a few minutes, then she had to leave.  On monday morning when I was introduced to the staff, one guy comes to me and asks me, "Where you on IHOP the other day?" I said "Yes I was" He said "Yes I know you were, I saw you with a friend of yours, I was going to stop by and say hello and welcome but then I backed out because I thought it was innapropriate"...I think I was being followed...  5 Saturdays before this one I promised my best friend I would go with her to a concert from one of her idols (Thalia) I don't think you've ever heard about her but, she's a big star in my country, so anyway. I promised I would go, but two weeks ago the person who bought the tickets for her had an accident and is in the hospital...the tickets were inside the car and the car is in the pound and the only person who can go check on the car is the owner of the car who happens to be the father of the person who had the accident and this father...ok..now I'm lost...wait...well the thing is that the tickets are inside the car and can't be checked...why? I don't remember, I wasn't paying attention when my friend told me about it.   So until yesterday there were no tickets for the concert right? so I thought I was out of the deal and my boyfriend said, ok, then if you're not going then I'm going to go paint a house. Well it happens that I was going to be the ride for my best friend but I don't take my car that far and that's why my boyfriend was going to take us but now he's working and we don't have a ride anymore. So now we have the tickets but we don't have a ride...How nice!  My best friend suggested to take the public transportation all the way to that stadium (between you and I, I think my friend just went insane)which is about 1 hour and some other more minutes to almost two hours by car, so imagine the time in public transp. right? I immediately said Hell no! what if we get stolen? what if someone is following us and wants to do something to us? We are in a different country! What if there is a terrorist and wants to blow up the Trolley? (I'm sorry but I am really freaked out about it). My friend called me a big whinning chicken and I said yes I am, and I am proud of it! I'm a big chicken I tell ya, can't you see feathers growing on me? I'm not going I said, unless you find us a ride to the stadium.  I told me boyfriend after he came back from work and he agreed on not to go in public transportation, most of all because I don't know the city and besides the concert would start too late and finished even later. We both agreed I would not go. Well, actually I agreed upon myself on not to go. My boyfriend was smoking his cigarette and wasn't really paying attention to me.   Though I feel bad about it, but I think I'm right...right? Of course I'm right!  Now I'm worried on how is my friend going to go all by herself, she told me that if I wasn't going she was going alone. I can see my poor LIl'O G going to that huge stadium, what if nobody sees her and steps on her? What if she gets lost  and has nobody with her to help her out?   I'm worried, I'm in a big dilema, I know I should not go, but my friend is a freak, she's a psycho and she will want to go and see her idol no mater what! She's going to get lost, I know it, I know it!  I think I should put a string on her finger and I'll just hold it and when ever she pulls it I will know she needs help. Yeah! I'll do something like that.

      Here we go again...But before I start...  I posted a blog in spanigh but then I removed it. I did it because that is just not me (I just don't do criticism). I was really angry at the time and well, (that's what Blogger is for right?)I apologize and at the same time I do appreciate that some of you readers still went through and read if not all of it but parts. I was not expecting any comments about my post but I got a reply in comment from one of my Co-Nationals and well he said another bunch of things just like mine but critisizing my post in a negative way which made me think I should not be even posting things or situations I am angry about because (we would never get to an agreement) then I would get even more negative comments about it and of course, I don't want that, just my aura and my vibe doesn't go that way. I'm all peace and loveeee.  So Starting from now...I won't do posts about Politics, Religion, Nationalities or Race (That's too controversial for me and is not fair to you)  Thank you.  Now, back to our regularly scheduled yoliblahblah...  I remember since I was a lil'o baby I hated first days, of school, of going to another place I didn't know, of staying at a strangers house, of school, of religious classes, of swimming classes, of work. And I could just go on and on and on...  It wasn't that "excitment" feeling of meeting new people, No! I don't like new people, I like old people, hell! I lived with old people long enough to know I like old people! You don't see old people at your first day of work, you always meet people you have never seen in your life and of course you turn into "The New Girl"...You can see everywhere you go people looking at you funny "Who's the new girl? Where she at? And if you're fat and ugly, Uh! "Damn! From where did they get that ugly woman? They should take her back where she belongs...Scrap material is that way!" "Woman, you hit the wrong turn, the circus is right over there".  So here are the thigns I hate the most about being the new girl in the company:  1. I have to wait in line until H.R. shows up (30 minutes later)  2. I have to fill out that annoying employment application. Damn! I hate that, I spent more than 1 hour filling out that form, I'm getting old people! I can't remember what was the year I finished my elementary school or how much I was earning 10 years ago, or what was the phone number and address of my first job and I don't think anybody does!  3. I have to wait half of day until someone in the department I'm going to work at picks me up and gives me a tour of the company, at least to show me where the restrooms are. (By the way that never happens to me, I never get a company tour, or induction so practically nobody knows me)  4. I have to take my lunch alone because of Item No.3  5. There's no computer, phone, chair, desk, keys for the desk, or nothing to write on so I can start working...at least on my scribbles.  6. I spent the whole day on trying to figure out what the hell am I doing in this company because is 1 hore before leave time and still nobody has taught me anyting.  7. It's time to go and now my boss has time for me so now I have to stay 2 hours late!  8. I spent half of day with an empty stomach because I don't know where the hot water is to make my cocoa and if I did know, people will start looking at me funny and say "Did you see that girl? I haven't seen her doing anything all day and now she's eating!"  9. As nobody knows me and one of my coworkers now know me she calls me to her table where shes eating with her group so I join in but I don't get introduced so I get the "What the? Who's this sitting on my table, on my chair, smelling my air" look which is very annoying and uncomfortable.  10. Finally I get a computer, a phone but part of all the programs are not working, the computer is weird and it makes funny noises, my phone doesn't work because it has a system problem and they only got me a chair and a desk to sit in a corner of a huuuuuge office, so now I feel like an ant.  But hey! The best part of all is that I get to sleep one hour more (NOT) and at least I don't work in a crappy joint anymore (true, true) and I don't have to stand the morning and afternoon traffic so now I do a 25 minute drive back and forth (Yippy!).

      It was my last day of work and my former boss made a move on me...  Finally on Thursday we found someone to replace me and Friday was her first day of work. I only had practically half of day to get her into the workload which is nothing but still there were things that needed to be done.   My boss invited me several times before to have lunch with him to celebrate Admins. week, but for one reason or the other this could not be done, but now that my last day of work was ending, lunch had to be done no matter what. I really don't feel comfortable eating lunch with my bosses, I mean, what kind of conversation am I going to have? Right? Well, it looked like I had no other choice but to accept the invitation and I was waiting for an excuse to appear so  I wouldn't go alone.   The new "girl" didn't bring any lunch for her self and well it seemed kind of unfair and not polite to not invite her out for lunch on her first day of work, besides, she's her new Admin. right? So I told my boss that maybe I should take her out for lunch (I was expecting my boss to ask me to take her along to my fare well lunch but it never happened). Basically my boss sent her to the nearest fast food restaurant so him and I could get along with his plans of having lunch with his Admin. Yikes!  Lunch I guess it was ok, at least he told me some weird stories about how his friends were robbed in Mexico while they were on vacations and that he would never think of coming here by himself alone. And that's where the personal questions began and it wasn't pretty. What kind of boss will ask his Admin. if she's engaged or if she's on a relationship and what of things does she like do to when she's not working? (That sounded more like a date...yuk) So I answered properly without giving him any thoughts that I am interested in his conversation (in the mean time I could not stop looking at my watch, I was waiting for 1:30 to come soon so I could kick him back to the border so I could go back to work). To make a long story short, he suggested we should have lunch together more often because I was an interesting woman and very fun and comfortable to be with, on which I repleid with a HELL NO! (on my forehead) and a no thanks I have work on my mouth.  All of this means that if there was a chance that if I didn't like the job I will start on Monday I would call my boss and ask him if I could come back; with these intentions the man showed me on my last day lunch, that chance is nule.   That really feels baaad; no boss has ever told me that before, I'm still a baby, I could be his daughter, hell! The man is 51 years of age and has a son of 23.   Well now I know why he was insisting soo much on going to lunch just the two of us...  In your dreams old man!  two hours before 5 I had a call from the delivery company. Woo hoo! They would bring my King Bed set at 5 so I had to go home...My problem is solved, they brought me my brand new king size bed, I already slept on it and feels like I'm sleeping under clouds. Ah! This is how heaven must feel like.  Now there's another problem, the bed is too tall and my TV stand is too short, so now I have to go look for a new TV stand because we can't watch TV anymore, the only thing we can see is half of the screen with 2 pairs of feet blocking what is left to see. That sucks!   But hey! Who needs TV with a brand new King Size Bed right?

      I just realized that when my boss is out of town everybody wants to be the boss…  Especially this Ops. Mgr. Monkey who now I don’t want to see for the rest of my stay here because he practically yelled at me yesterday at my holy lunch hour…What a Jerk!  And also realized nobody in this building can live without me. Yesterday I acted as if I was not at work; I was serious when I said I was officially blocked from my brain and nobody believed me, and everything went upside down. At this work I am at I’m supposed to be the reminder or the alarm clock for each of the management staff members because they use to “forget” to do their job, I mean, it can’t be that difficult but hey! For them it is.  So their alarm went into sleep mode which meant no email reminding them to do their reports, no emails sending information, no phone call reminders, no post it reminders no nothing, simply I was not here, but I was, but I acted as if I wasn’t (get it?). Everybody went crazy.  It’s fun to see Managers yelling at each other for not sending their information on time because all of them forgot they should’ve done it at one time and now it’s their fault and the corporate office is kicking their tooshy (oh that makes me laugh!).  I imagine these people as if they’re playing “hot potato” and who ever gets the potato at the end of the song has nobody to throw it away gets poked for the rest of the day (this is the guy who was supposed to send his info to corporate but didn’t because everybody was late) LMAO.  And who gets yelled at because everything is wrong?    All answer:  Yoli, she’s suppose to tell us things and she didn’t. Boss fire her!   Boss:  You’re all babies! I’m going to get you a baby sitter while we hire a new Nanny!   Yoli:  Yeah, you’re all a bunch of big babies with mustache and hairy backs! * sticks tongue out  and hides behind boss*   How sweet, my stalker has just told me he’ll miss me …   I’m happy now

      I’m here but let’s pretend as if I’m not ok?…  The Real Deal: Uh! No, you’re gonna have to do that by your own. Sorry, I am just here to answer questions for the rest of the week. I have officially blocked my brain, myself, and everything in regards to me inside this crappy joint. Alright! What? You’re saying I can’t do that? Hey! I tried yesterday and talk to H.R. Monkey to see what the heck is up with my replacement ‘cause it’s been a week and a half and I don’t see any girl for interview here! Or maybe give the girl in front desk a chance to change position so that we can help each other, as a team. Oh! I forgot this ass doesn’t know what the work team means because he is a Mooonkey just like the rest of the monkeys who work in this zoo. So now don’t come to me and tell me I can’t say no to you! Hell yes I can! Look! NO! Now get the hell out of my face!   Image inside Yoli’s brain (so she doesn’t get sick from stress): Oops! I came to work and I (intentionally) forgot to bring my brain with me, how silly of me! Sorry I left it at home. What? Oh no! I can’t go back home and get it because then I will loose my parking spot and this parking spot is so perfect, I can see my car right where it is in a corner across the street where all the big trucks can hit it with their big heavy wheels or some junky can steel it without anybody looking. No, no, no. I really can’t. Maybe tomorrow if I don’t forget I’ll bring it ok?  Bu bye!  *******  I know this is a complot!  I spent 7 miserable months coming and going with bottle waters, cookies, food, drinks, visits, worrying about who will pick up the visits and things that matter “transportation” without getting any gas expenses back and now that I’m leaving, H.R. Monkey has hired a driver.    *^$*&)*%#%$&)_)

      See previous post  As I said, this would continue, well it did.   H.R. Monkey (On the phone):  Office Moneky X told me you gave me a D/L request, I don't remember you giving me any request. (Note the change of story)   Me:  No I didn't.    H.R. Monkey (On the phone):  Ok, thanks, bye.  1 minute later Ops. Mgr. Monkey calls me on the phone   Ops. Mgr. Monkey:  Yoli, Office Monkey X gave you 2 D/L requests for signature (note the change of quantity of requests, before it was just one, now there are two) what happened to them?   Me:  Repeated story of what I did with the request.   Ops. Mgr. Monkey:  Well where are they?   Me:  I remember there was only one request, and no I don't know where it is.   Ops. Mgr. Monkey:  Well yeah whatever, your boss still has it?   Me:  I don't know   Ops. Mgr. Monkey:  Did he keep it with him? Maybe is in his office   Me:  No he did not keep it, he took it directly to H.R. and no is not in his office, I went inside and there were no such documents.   Ops. Mgr. Monkey:  Well but then he has it.   Me:  I don't know   Ops. Mgr. Monkey:  Then he kept it   Me (about to explode):   Probably... maybe... might be... it could be a guess...can't say he did...I don't know.   Ops. Mgr. Monkey:  Ok, (hangs up the phone)  Still I'm sure, this is not the end...

      This happened 10 minutes ago...  As if my desk was the area of Lost and Found.   "Just ask Yoli, she'll know where it is, and if she doesn't, she will figure it out for you"   Office Monkey X:  Yoli, what happened to the D/L request I left you on thursday for your boss's signature?   Me:  I gave it to him, he asked me what it was I told him, he took it to H.R.  Office Monkey X goes to H.R. dept. and 5 minutes later appears on my desk...again   Office Monkey X:   I went to H.R. and he said he doesn't have it. Do you know where it is?   Me:   No.   Office Monkey X:   But did your boss sign it?   Me:   I don' know, he took it to H.R. he said he would ask him what it was.   Office Monkey X:   But H.R. says he doesn't have it. Do you think Op. Mgr. has it?   Me:   I don't know, but if I were you I would ask him.   One of two things could've happened:  #1 My boss went to the WC and forgot it there #2 H.R. lost it between his ocean of papers over his desk  I am sure this will continue...

      This time will go by item number…  #1 Got lost on Friday in my own home area. I was looking for an apartment for my parents who are moving back to the city in 3 months, the town is very small, so small it only has 3 Avenues and 6 main streets. I drove around the same blocks for 15 minutes and I could not find the way out. I was in a maze. Right when I thought I found the exit I hit a dead end. Took me 1 hour to get out of there and to realize I was only 10 blocks away from my home.   #2 Got lost in a shopping mall Saturday while I was looking at a purse, thinking boyfriend was behind me I turned around to show him the purse … Yikes! Where did he go? Spent 20 minutes walking in circles, I could see the perfume ladies and the electronics guy with a huge question mark on their faces “?” No, I’m not lost, I’m looking for my boyfriend who was with me just 30 seconds ago. Finally I found my boyfriend at the entrance…He was outside looking for me!  #3 Got ourselves a brand new King Size bed, bought in the U.S. Now the issue is, how to cross the border with it. I said to boyfriend, tie it on the car roof, I’ll hold one end and you hold the other end. He looked at me and said, “Are you Insane?” I said “No, I’ve seen cars with beds on car roofs before, my dad used to do that!” Boyfriend points to his car and says, “Look at the size of the bed and look at the size of my car”. He was right; if we could have put the mattress on the roof, from far way it would look like a big bed with wheels running on the freeway.  #4 Went with boyfriend to have his hair cut on Sunday morning, it was 11 am and the weather was unbearable, I think we were at 85ºF (maybe more); we had to wait in the car until the barber shop emptied; I felt I was marinating in my own juices so after we came back from the barber shop I took a shower, when I took off my pants I found red spots on my right leg. It took the sun only 15 minutes to practically roast my right leg, now I have to find a way to roast the other one so they can be even. Now this makes me think, if the sun can really roast a leg in 15 minutes, I can save on gas the next time I want to cook something while it’s marinating in its own juices.   Happy Monday!

        Your Heart is Grey    urlLink   What Color is Your Heart?      brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Yep, I always knew I am Grey. In fact, I was grey all the time yesterday, the event sucked, I wasn't at the party 'cause it sucked, I didn't know it did but I knew it would, anyway. I started my shift as regular at 7:30 am and there was not one soul in the company, today everybody would show up to work at 8:00 am, and I forgot, I could have slept more but no, Yoli had to forget today we were allowed at 8:00 am. Oh well, at least it gave me 30 minutes of free bloggin'.   Muuaahahahaha.

      That should be the name of my company…  I have a window next to my desk where I can see everything in the production floor and they are setting up a big stage for the biggest event ever in the History of this Company. As if Disneyland was having its grand opening celebration or as if a new kind of amusement park was to be opened; that’s exactly how everything is being packed and ready to go.  Now this is what we in our Mexican culture would call “Naco”; a “Naco” for the people who have never heard of the word before is an expression for the people who like to show off a lot with lots and lots of bad taste in everything; for example, we would call a “Naco” anybody or anything that would have the Mexican football team posted in the bedroom, car, house, T-shirt, etc. etc. etc. Or we would call “Naco” those who have their 15 Year Party (equal to the Sweet 16 Party) and the girl would wear a huge pumped dress with lots and lots and lots of ribbons and the dress would have to look like one of the “Three Princess” from the Disney Cartoons…get the picture?… Good.  Well that’s what this company is “Naco” the worst “Naco” company I’ve ever worked for in my whole life. I’m embarrassed.  But, I would not be called a “Naca” if I wanted an “Oscar the Grouch” T-shirt right? I love Oscar the Grouch and I want my smelly green T-shirt. I’m getting out of the subject now…well, the thing is, tomorrow, the grand opening of the company at the luxurious Hotel in Rosarito Beach and lots and lots of Fireworks and Mexican food for lunch and at the end there will be a dance.  I am not going….buncha Nacooos!  But from where is that coming from? Oh I was wondering but last Friday I new where the idea came from. The Vice Prisident, yep, the Vice President of the Company is a “Naco”, he’s from Peru, and the whole company has the idea of a Peru style Country House but with no taste what so ever, I don’t have anything against Peru, but this guy’s taste is way our of wack! On Friday, the Vice President bought a lot of Pre-Hispanic figurines from Peru, including a wooded crocodile which measured 1 feet and 30 inches long; and the thing that had to give it the last hit of “Naconess” was a “Poncho” which will be exhibited in the lunch room….Somebody shoot me!  Excuse me Mr. Vice President, can I borrow your Poncho? My feet are cold.

      What’ma gonna do when I get outta there?... I’m gonna have some…SLEEP…  It’s been a hard week for sure. I can barely open my eyes, they really need some rest away from the computer, the more days pass by the more blur appears in my sight and this time is not dirt on my glasses, or a splat of toothpaste or guacamole, nope! I checked them many times and they are sparkling clean, I’m just tired, so tired that when I close my eyes I feel I’m going to bang my head on the keyboard, that’s how tired I am.  Finally I found the perfect apartment for my parents so I don’t have to worry about “apartment browsing” and having to talk to “Igor’s” around….Aahh!! Mental Image.  My boss came back with a killer flu, just looking at him sniffing and coughing made me feel sick, I was coughing too and feel funny in my throat. In short, this week was not pink with flowers as I thought it would be. Hope next week gets better. As soon as I get home I have to start cleaning my joint, it’s junky, it’s messy and I killed two ugly spiders with one complete bottle of bug spray and still the damn bugs would not die. That means, deep clean needs to be done….today, tomorrow I can’t, I have to wake up early ‘cause we are going to get some furniture in one place called the “Salvation Army” for my sisters in law who have their brand new “mouse house” and I think a mouse house is bigger. Let’s see if I find something nice for myself.  By the way, after 25 years of being told by my parents that when I go to a stranger’s home and they offer me food I don’t like I have too eat it all anyway; my dad told me last Sunday there are few exceptions to pass if the food looks really, really nasty…Thanks Dad, I almost die of food poisoning and after that you tell me this?  Ok here’s the story:  Last week my b/f and I went to buy some things for my sisters in law they needed for their new home and when we finished I was starving, we didn’t eat anything since 8 am, and it was already 5:30 pm when we got to the sisters house. I didn’t want to eat there because their food is weird, is not the typical kind of food some of us are used to, they’re foreigners so their cooking is a lot different. So one sister in law asked me if we had our lunch and I said no, she was worried for a second but then she sent her son to get the leftover food they left in the other house. When they came back with the food I could not believe my eyes; one big bowl of fried rice and one full bowl of something that looks like tomato soup with meat, fried onions and something in between a squash and cactus (it’s hard to describe) and lots and lots and lots of grease, from all the dishes that one I hate the most, but what could I do? I was in a stranger’s house and they were serving a dish I puke every time I see it. Well, I kind if distracted everybody while I was eating the fried rice slowly, very slowly, so slowly everybody in the house asked what was wrong…me and my green puking face said “Nothing” so they said, well then eat some more and they got the bowl of “soup” closer to my hands, ok, at that point I could not say no, so I had to take one spoon of  “that something” and put it in the rice so I can cover up the taste, but still the taste would not go away. I was about to throw up the whole bite in front of the nephew but I just swallowed the whole thing at once, with no water by my side, I just had to hold my breath for a few “minutes” so the nausea would go away; It was a nightmare.  People:  If you are one of those parents who force your kids to eat the whole dish when they go to a strangers house please tell them the “exceptions” in life, you don’t want them to be traumatized…like me.  Happy Weekend!

      Nope, Internet was down and that is a waste of time…  I was not on vacation but my boss was for a whole week, and that meant I could have even more time to blog around and just act silly right?… Wrong!  I had more work than I could ever imagine, we added 7 more new reports to my report list, which means 8 hours of data entry… that really stinks!  In the mean time my boss was on vacation the internet decided to take a few days off by itself too, it was hard, there was no internet, no internet radio, no internet jokes, no internet pointers, no fun at all. Life without internet really is bad and boring, so I had nothing else to do but to get ahead with my work and I finished, today, and today my boss is back from vacation, which means no vacation for Yoli either. Bleah!  Yesterday something weird and spooky happened; I’m searching for a small apartment for my parents who are moving back to my town after 2 years of being in the south, of course I still have 2 months more to look for it but my house is so full of home junk I can no longer fit in there so I have to start looking right away before I can no longer sleep in my own home.   So there I was “apartment browsing” and well I did not find much of what I was looking for except for one apartment that is right half a block away from my apartment, the only thing is the stairs are really weird, they’re so small and so high that with my big feet I think I will fall down the stairs one of those days and I think my parents will too if they don’t watch it. But anyhow I think I’m getting that one. Ok but now I am out of the subject here; I was browsing around and I saw this building that didn’t look so bad from the outside so I thought it would not look bad from the inside right? So I called right in and they told me just what I wanted to hear, so I asked if I could go there and take a look at it and the woman accepted to I just got off my car and went to inside the building.  There I found at the first level one big door/fence or what ever you want to call that door covered in a shower curtain…odd. After standing outside that door for around 2 minutes one man looking like one of those creepy scary movie serial killers crossed eye and big eye balls like they were going to pop out of his face, one tooth hanging from his mouth, I think the end of the root was holding the tooth because it looked like if someone blown some air in there the tooth would fall out. The appearance of the old man looked very scary and at that moment I wanted to run away and undo the mental image in my head but I had no other choice but to stay there and just wait until everything ended. Good thing the apartment looked as horrible as the owner, it was so dirty and so claustrophobic that as soon as I got out of there I went home, took a shower and sanitized myself with lots and lots and lots of dial.   Good thing the nightmare is over, I am never going over there again.   So the big news right now around the company is … President Fox was going to be here for the Inauguration of the building….ha ha! They changed the date maybe 10 times or more until finally it was decided that June 29 would be the day, because President Fox said it would be better before his birthday (that’s what people say). Today in the morning meeting a very reliable source from my company said that he was not coming anymore (duh) anybody who believes in Santa Claus (and I think it was everybody her) would really believe the President of Mexico would come….That made me laugh. Oh well.  I feel sorry for the “Parrots Upstairs” because they went to have their hair fixed, and bought new clothes in the most expensive shopping malls in San Diego and all just to get the notice that the replacement for the Grand Opening will be our beer belly Governor (and that…is a maybe)  Happy Humpday!

      I really don't find it funny...  I've been having a bad "one eye-ache" since tuesday and I am not able to make it go away. I was not able to see very well although I have my glasses all day long. I thought for an instant I need new glasses because everything is so blurry especially on my right eye. So right about a few minutes ago I had an eye-itch and I had to take my glasses off to scratch my achin eye and what do you know? the blurr went away; it wasn't a lash, or a piece of lint stuck in my eye, is just that my glasses were so dirty especialy from the right side with a big drop of dry toothpaste right in the middle....  I hope that cleaning my glasses will solve my "one eye-ache" problem 'cause it really is starting to annoy me now.  Happy Thursday.

      Think last weekend was not productive? Well for me it was…  Ok let’s get down to business here. In case you were wondering where I’ve been….I’ve been working, yeah! Working, not just “at work” like my other crappy joint, but working with all the word “Work” means, damn, now I am complaining about work, that’s pathetic, how we humans are never satisfied, that sucks!  But life never sucks when Friday night is at full bloom….oh my goodness! Yeah for that I can’t complain, I woke up refreshed and ready to shop, shop, shop, and hell did I shop!  Have you ever felt pain from shopping? No, not that kind of pain when you open your credit balance at the end of the month and is so high you feel pain in your brain and you wish you were dead. I mean the kind of pain you feel in your arm for carrying so much clothes around for so many hours ‘cause you’ve been picking up the whole store…yeah I mean that kind of pain, the happy pain, the pain you can bare when you still have your cramped arms and feet for walking too much. The happy pain when is Monday and you can’t even hold your pen and you remember, “Oh, I went shopping over the weekend” yeah that’s the pain I’m talking about. Isn’t that great?  Finally I went shopping on Saturday, all by myself, with no boyfriend to keep looking at me funny at the clothes/color/model I pick, or being rushed by some friend or family member and keep looking at their face hoping they don’t get nervous or angry ‘cause they’ve been with you all morning and you still haven’t decided which color of blouse to take and at the very end you en up picking up both or leaving both and choosing another one. That for me is being in Paradise. So after too much shopping for over 4 hours I was exhausted but happy, thought I didn’t find any shoes I liked but still I was happy. Can’t complain, won’t complain and I’ll keep myself happy for the rest of the week (Now I just need to put that note in front of my monitor so I don’t get al grumpy…too late)  Sunday you ask? Oh it couldn’t be better; washed clothes, made breakfast…but I didn’t make any lunch or dinner, and…I didn’t wash any dishes…hurray for me!!!   Ok, Monday, Monday? Don’t ask. Been busy all morning, with lots and lots of reports to finish, I’m 1 hour away to go and I’m still not finished with the urgent parts; Aaaggghhh!!  But hey! It’s Friday afternoon, almost time to go and the week is almost done….just 4 more days, please hold 4 more days!  By the way, my butt is getting so flat just by sitting in this chair all morning…now that, really sucks!  Bleah!

      Ta-ta-ta-taaaah---tah-taaaah….  Ok, Maybe I exagerated a little when I said that it was fun to find a place where all the little Yolis working along together in peace…NOT !  I found out there are other kinds of Yolis working here, and these are the kind of Yolis Yoli don’t like to play  with. These are the evil Yoli’s, the Yoli nobody would like to have as a friend.  This is the advertisement for my work.   “If you’re feeling depressed, fat, ugly, with no education, low self steem, come work at Yoli’s work, here at our facilities we have the most qualified people to make you feel even worse than what you’e feeling now; our specialized personnel have a way of saying things that if you are fat…well…you were, we can make you bulimic or anorexic, just join us at lunch break…and you’ll see the difference within minutes!”  We have a group of about 10 women who just love to eat each other and competing of who makes more time working out at the Gym and who irons less and who has the best cleaning lady and so on. Yoli just listens to the rest of the evil Yolis because she has nothing else to do. So I’m thinking to myself, “Man! I must be a wonder woman…why?”  1.	I work 2.	I clean the house 3.	I cook for me and my bf 4.	I do our laundry 5.	I wash dishes 6.	I iron clothes 7.	I do the house payments, etc, etc.  Wow, I must not be the wonder woman…forgot to mention the gym! Oh my god! I’m not a super woman anymore…I’m not perfect because I don’t go to the gym…ok, Yoli should now shut up and just listen at the latest deals the gym has to offer and what is the new hot thing after pilates, and yoga and spinning and tae bo? For that I am speechless!  So maybe after reminiscing a few minutes and saying to myself “Yoli, you should be ashamed of yourself, you’re a fat chick who’s too damn lazy to go to the gym when you have loads of time to do it!”   But then again, after thinking and re arranging my schedule once again I said to myself “ Ok Yoli, if you want to go to the Gym you gotta give up something and to give up something that means you have to hire someone to take care of the something you just gave up to which means spend double your money…oh oh!”  Wait a minute! While I was listening to those evil Yolis I see those evil Yolis just going home, taking off their clothes and head off the gym like good’ol working women, (of course none of them have kids) and they say they don’t have time for anything but they do have time for a 3 hour session of gym…Heck! In 3 hours I can do a lot in my house and I would not spend money, hey! Cleaning up the house is a great effort and causes you to move some muscles, so why not make it an exercise to clean up your damn house and stop whining that you have to pay the cleaning lady cause you don’t have time for anything, not even for your husband? Pleeeaasseeee! Lazy Ass Women!! They don’t deserved to be called Yolis so I am taking off their titles as of today….they will be lowered as the “Parrots upstairs”.  So as I was saying before, I was reminiscing and thought, I might not be a wonder woman but I do make wonders in other isssues!! Hehe  I am a fatty chick but I don’t care, my man loves me that way, and he appreciates my cooking, my cleaning and his downy smelling laundry….  Maybe in another life, I’ll try to go to the gym..but not in this one nah ha! I’m enjoying my life as I only have one!  Woo hoo! I have more me time now starting today…I spoke to my boss and said I needed to change my working hours from 7 to 5 buy he said, ok, neither you or me, 7:30 am to 5:30 pm…I said, ok….but still in the next few months I will ask for another change, and that will be from 7 to 5…..no more! So today I am heading off “early” at 5:30 pm, 30 minutes is 30 minutes, you can do lots of things in 30 minutes.  If you haven’t noticed I am living by the time here…  Woo hoo!

      Where did Saturday and Sunday go?…  Don’t you just hate it when you had your weekend but you feel like you didn’t have it at all? For me this is an insult, I mean I can gladly say “oh my week passed and I didn’t even feel it” but not for the weekend! What gives? I spend 5 long days to wait for Saturday to come and just like that it’s gone? Oh that’s not fair! Worst if you weekend was not productive like you thought.  I wanted to go to the shopping mall to get me my new clothes that I owe myself as a birthday gift and still now I haven’t gone, my  boyfriend had to drive his brother to the airport and for what my boyfriend told me he would go early, for me, early means between 8 am and 11 am. Noon for me is between 11 and 2 pm, afternoon for me is between 2:00 pm and 5:00 pm and night is for me between 5 pm and 10 pm.   So my boyfriend says,   I’m going to drive my brother to the airport tomorrow noon.   Me: Ok good, at what time are you coming back?  B/F: In the afternoon  Me: Ok, so I’m going to the shopping mall do you need something?  B/F: At what time are you going to go?  Me: right after you’re leaving.  B/F: And at what time are you coming back?  Me: Probably around 4 or 5, why?  B/F: Because I’m coming back right after I drop my brother.  Me: Ok, so do you want me to wait for you or what?  B/F: Ok, if you want.  Me: Well then at what time are you coming back ?  B/F: Maybe around 6 or 7.  Me: That’s too late!  B/F: What do you mean is too late? Is afternoon  Me: Excuse me! Afternoon for me is (read above), so are you coming back early or what?   B/F: I don’t know between 4 and 6  Me: (Silence….and big breath)  To make the long story short, I decided to wait for my boyfriend so we could go together to the shopping mall…. Now the question is…did we go to the shopping mall??  Exactly….we didn’t go, instead we ended up going to the nearest drug store and buy my shampoo and drove to rent a movie….does that have anything relative or similar to my previous plan?  Exactly….it didn’t, at all!  Sunday could have been more productive, though it was only relaxing, so no, I didn’t go to the shopping mall, instead we ended up in the grocery store buying the stuff we needed for the week and I ended up cooking lunch….  Weekends are not cooking days for Yoli!!!!  But that’s preferable than having boyfriend to cook for me, now that would be very not productive and a waste of day.  Happy Monday!

      Alright, here’s the deal…You give me more space and I’ll come to work earlier….  This is my thought every morning when I look at my boss, too bad I'm still new here and I can't say anything...yet. I have a 1” by 1” size desk and I can’t do anything because everything is lost between all those papers I have around me and it takes me more time  looking for the report I was about work on before someone came to me and gave me a bunch of more paper to work on, so  what was I working on again??  Says me: What can I do to rearrange this mess?   Inner self says: “get rid of the stuffed animals you have there and you'll have more room.”   Says me: Nooo I can’t do that, they’re my babies, I can’t get rid of my stuffed animals, I can’t work without them!  Inner self says: But look at this place, your desk looks more like a kinder garden than an office desk!  Says me: That’s what is all about, I’m supposed to play with my toys when I get nervous.  And really that’s what I do.  My desk is mostly filled with stuffed animals consisting in two pink haired mini trolls, three crystal cats, two turtles that move their head when there’s motion, one kitty cat, one moose and a big Tigger, plus lots and lots of papers, and paper clips, and more papers, and papers, and papers, and papers….  I’m starting to see double ‘cause the computer is right in front of me and then, my boss comes and sits on my desk with more of his papers ‘cause his desk is full of papers and has nowhere else to sit….Bleah!  Ooooh but today I won’t complain, today was one of the happiest Fridays of my life, yep, we had “Carne Asada” or what in America is called a barbecue, all this to say thanks to all of the people who worked hard since the company started operations so they gave us 2 full hours of eating…and eating and eating some more…aaahhh I’m full, so full I can’t even work, so full I can’t even walk…so full I can’t even think and so full that if I open my mouth one taquito will get out of there…..yikes!   Happy weekend everyone!

      How far will humans go for the sake of laziness?…  How difficult is it to just unzip, sit, do your doo doo’s, wipe, zip, flush….huh?   Is it really that hard? Does it make too much exercise for your hand to flush the toilet after your done? Cause if it was, I bet it would go after the spinning session or the Tae-Bo practice, “Flushing session @ 6:00 pm Mon-Tue-Friday” I bet you that, or it would be advertised in one of those telemarketing channels at 2 am:   “The flusher 2000 Plus, includes 1 easy to use light weight ready to go toilet, and weights in the chain so you can start pumping your fingers at the scale you desire, call in now and we’ll include a toilet cleaner, and air freshener and a big carry bag to take your Flusher 200 Plus Free! That’s right, call in the next 30 minutes and you will receive those 3 items for Free, so why wait! Other toilets give you the same weight every time and they’re so heavy you have to stay at home to use it, but not with the Flusher 2000 Plus, the Flusher 2000 Plus gives you plenty to work on, you can work on your back arm, your shoulders, and if you’re tougher even your jaws, call now for this special offer”.   But no, actually flushing toilets is not an exercise and is one of the easiest things to do in the world, hey! If you can play X-Box or Super Mega Nintendo Hi Tec Plus with lots and lots of tiny little buttons you can flush a freaking toilet!!!!  That’s why the scientists and computer technology experts designed the automatic toilet flush (not recommended for people with heart condition) which makes a fresh flush every 5 seconds (if you were thinking of lasting longer in a toilet for sure your tooshie will get showered with cool water at least 3 times before you get up).  I have never liked these automatic toilet systems, first because when I get in there this little red light indicates you’re there, about to do your stuff, as if someone was watching me or something, I don’t know, I feel naked with this toilet; second because I am about to get started with my business when FLUUSSSHH goes the toilet, I can’t concentrate, I just can’t.   This afternoon I had the nature call and there I went to take a visit to Mr. Automatic bowl, and it right when I was about to get relaxed this annoying bowl flushed and guess what I did? I half got up with half my pants down because I got scared; imagine peace and quiet inside the restroom and suddenly you hear this flushing sound underneath and you feel fresh air coming down your tooshie and little sprinkles of water…that’s traumatizing…for me it is!, good thing the door was able to stop me ‘cause otherwise I would have stamped myself in the toilet in front, now that would be embarrassing, Yoli with her pants down landing on the person sitting in the toilet infront of me…I can hardly see the image there.   I think that besides this electronic red eye laser there should be a voice asking us permission to flush the toilet would have a voice detector so when we said No then the toilet would hold, and after 5 seconds more the voice would ask permission to flush again and if we said Yes, until then it would flush….yeah, that’s a good idea don’t you think? That way we are all happy and we can all do our business properly without having our tooshies flushed 3 or 4 times, now that I would call it the Flusher 2000 Plus.

      All the fun went bye bye...  Well starting today I have two new guys working in the same office as me. They are two students that are here only for 2 months. I can't scratch my boobie anymore as often as I wanted, I can't sing as loud as before, I can't say stupid things anymore...that's no fun!  These kids are 22 and 18, both looking like 15 year olds, when they were introduced to me both gave me a kiss on the cheek...yuck! you know I am a germofobic so I wanted to take a shower like...right now! Anyway, that's no way of saying nice meeting you to a totally weird stranger right??? These kids are freaks..!  I'm taking a 2 minute break before I can get back to work again. But before that let me tell you what happened to me over the weekend...  Nothing... ha!  Well just on saturday, it was my birthday and I turned the quarter, (I'm getting old!) My boyfriend didn't come back home until later that night and he came with a beautiful bouquet of flowers and a mini ice cream cake, it was great. The flowers had a card, but the card had no message in it...How original huh? When I saw the card I turned to see my boyfriend and he looked at me funny asking me why I was looking at him funny, then I showed him the card and he said "Oh I'm sorry, I wanted to write somehting in there but I forgot"....Well ok...it doesn't matter, I said, just don't forget to take a shower cause you stink (he spent the whole day painting a house, that's why he stank)  And...that's about it  I've been working alot since yesterday, and today finally I had a little time to write a few words here. Now with my new neighbors...I'll have more things to write on there hehe!.

      And the beginning of everything…  I hate the end of month, if some of you people work in an industry or work as an accountant you will know what I’m talking about.   Is the date when you have to re-arrange everything for the next month to come. It is where you find big, hell huge mistakes in all of your reports and you have to check item by item to find where the mistake begun and because you did not check that before because it was well hidden now you have to unbuild and rebuild everything all over again, from scratch since day one of the month before ‘cause if a little decimal does not match with the current plan you’re screwed and it means you’re an A-H. That’s right, and a big one.   That’s what it is when you work for a company that has to do with lots and lots of numbers. If some of you don’t work in an industry and think it would be a great idea to start working in one. PLEASE DON’T…It’s real hell in here.  So as it is already the end of the fiscal month and my boss thinks he’s the big Sheeat around here (which he really is but still I am in denial) he’s stepping on my feet to get the whole monthly package for the big pile of mud the big one the heavy shiieety boss (that means the VP). And I thought that being a Production Admin was a very easy job to do. Well I was wrong.   I miss being the Executive Admin for the Director, now I see the girl who is the Admin for the big boss and she’s so nice, so pretty, her hair is so well done, wearing high heels and nice suits and with her perfect manicure being so elegant and doing what I miss the most…nothing!  And here I am, with my nails broken and perfectly cut to the tip of my fingers because typos here are the worst mistake you could ever do in your life. Wearing working shoes because I’m not allowed with heels and open shoes at the production floor, regular working clothes and if it’s the oldest ones I can find in my closet the better it is because I have to walk through the areas that have lots of things that might ruin my clothes, etc. etc, etc.   But I’m not complaining, oh no, I’m just spitting out my stress, which will not end until the end of the week.   If I was Garfield I would have broken the ceiling by now, my company is testing the emergency alarm and as I was to expect, it’s right in my back. So image the sound it’s making at this very moment…I wished I were deaf!  Happy Tuesday everyone!  It is Tuesday right? Or is it Monday still?   Bleah!

      &nbsp; Back in the days…  &nbsp;  I remember when I was little, maybe around 2o or 3 years of age, you know the age when you want to know everything and you ask “why” for what ever thing that crosses your mind. I didn’t use to ask much I remember that but I loved discovering things by my own.  &nbsp;  Like for example:  &nbsp;  I discovered when you eat ants they cause you stomach pain and a real bad diarrhea.  &nbsp;  I discovered that eating the blue little things inside the powder detergent made me sneeze a lot and also caused me a bad diarrhea.  &nbsp;  I discovered that Play Do tastes salty and really bad, but once you get used to the flavor, it’s not so bad actually.  &nbsp;  I also discovered that dog and cat food has a tangy sour flavor but definitely not tasty but at least it didn’t cause me diarrhea, so I suppose it’s eatable for humans too.  &nbsp;  I discovered that crayons are really chewable and can make a good replacement for bubble gum, of course without the bubble, thought it did cause me a bad stomach pain and well diarrhea too.  &nbsp;  I discovered that is really not a good idea to pour Vapo-rub on your private parts because it burns like hell.  &nbsp;  So you see, I have discovered many things that maybe some of you have never willed to try.  &nbsp;  And actually when I now say something like:  &nbsp;  “This tastes like rubber”  &nbsp;  “This tastes like cardboard”  &nbsp;  “This tastes like chalk”  &nbsp;  “This tastes like WD-40”  &nbsp;  And people look at me funny, I can’t help it I just have to say, “well I tried it and it really does taste like that”&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

      I think I found the perfect mutant of a human&nbsp;and a dog... &nbsp; Have you seen how dogs when you cross their block or their little piece of ground they start barking at you until you leave? Well I know a few people in my neighborhood&nbsp;who are&nbsp;just like that. &nbsp; The parking space was empty the whole weekend and actually was empty the whole month. So my boyfriend and I thought it would be a good idea to put our cars together on one sigle parking space and so we did only for one night. &nbsp; Yesterday afternoon I tried to do the same but as&nbsp;I was about to do so there comes this woman our neighbor upstairs who happened to stop by to check on her apartment and when she saw my car biting a little piece of her parking space she started "Barking" at me. Yes, just as you read it, She just got out of her car to shout me to move my car away from her parking space and as I moved my car she&nbsp;left. So again I parked my car correctly and there she comes again shouting at me that I am moving back to her space (lunatic woman), so there I go again moving my car and she stayed there until she made sure the crop in the street was biting my car tire and then she left. The only thing she needed was a leach, a bone and a tail. &nbsp; Same thing happened a few months ago when one old lady went to visit one of my neighbors in the building and she didn't know about the barking humans upstairs&nbsp;so after 2 hours or so when the ugly neighbor saw she had her parking space blocked she barked at the old lady but this time she had company, her brother in law, her sister and her "puppy's". &nbsp; Yep I have&nbsp;dogs for neighbors, bad dogs....bad dogs.&nbsp; &nbsp; So today you've learned a lesson folks. People also "Bark" &nbsp; So after what happened yesterday I&nbsp;now say to my visitors: &nbsp; "Just don't park in this space, there are dogs keeping an eye on it, they might bite and have rabies" &nbsp;

      &nbsp;  What would you do if…  &nbsp;  Me: Ok so now that you have a car you should buy an alarm for it  &nbsp;  Bf: No I can’t right now, I don’t have any money,  &nbsp;  Me: It’s only $80 dollars!  &nbsp;  Bf: Oh look at this cool phone and it’s only $150 dlls that’s cheap!.  &nbsp;  Or….  &nbsp;  Bf: I can’t see well, I need my sunglasses  &nbsp;  Me: What you need is a pair of reading glasses ‘cause you can barely see the….WATCH  THE STOP LIGHT YOU’RE GOING TO HIT THE CAR!!!!!!!!!!!  &nbsp;  Or…  &nbsp;  Me: Take the original documents out of the car just in case, or take out one of the wires  &nbsp;  Bf: No, that’s ok, I’ll just leave it on the street, I don’t think something will happen to it.  &nbsp;  Me: Well then park it on my space, my car is yunk and yours is not.  &nbsp;  Bf: No, it’s ok, just leave it.  &nbsp;  Me: Well then buy the freaking insurance!  &nbsp;  Bf: No it’s too expensive and I can’t affort it right now.  &nbsp;  Me: We’ll see if your car gets stolen again if you have 400 dlls to buy another one just like that one.  &nbsp;  What I’m planning to do at our anniversary and his birthday:  &nbsp;  I will buy one bow with one card. Why?  &nbsp;  Because I have given him a pack of lotion with aftershave and moisturizing cream and now ask me where it was.  &nbsp;  Inside the stolen car.  &nbsp;  I gave him one shirt originally made in Veracruz and ask me where it was.  &nbsp;  Inside the stolen car  &nbsp;  I gave him for his birthday one big tool box with lots and lots and lots of cool tools. Now ask me where that was….  &nbsp;  Yeah… In the stole car.  &nbsp;  So now before his gifts get stolen or lost I will loose them for him, at least I will know where they were…  &nbsp;Happy Monday everyone!

      Yep, there’s a Part 2 believe it or not…  &nbsp;  Frankly the Humpback must look pretty beside me. I need sleep, I look so yellow and pale I scare people, hell I even scare myself.  &nbsp;  Last night everything seemed so quiet it was unbelievable there were no noises outside. But I was thinking too early because later at night 2:00 am to be exact the nice neighbor lady again takes its shieety ass puppy out to poop; and this time I was not going to lay in bed waiting for them to shut up.  &nbsp;  Little by little as I promised I was turning into Hulk and last night was the night my room exploded.  &nbsp;  Neighbor: HA HA HA HA Look at this mother f..ker, it wants to sh..t on the wheel (I freak out with the hope it was not my car wheel)  &nbsp;  Dog: Grrrrr…..dwarf!  &nbsp;  Neighbor: No, no, no, no, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up!  &nbsp;  Dog: Dwarf, dwarf, dwarf, dwarf,  &nbsp;  Neighbor: Shut up, and come here, come here you, leave the cat alone!  &nbsp;  Dog: Grrrrr  &nbsp;  Cat: Mmmmmmmeeeeeoooowwwwwww Heeeezzzzzzzzzzzzz  &nbsp;  Neighbor: Go, shoo, shoo (big foot steps)  &nbsp;  I think at that moment the dog was chasing the cat around because the woman just kept yelling at the puppy all over the parking area.  &nbsp;  By then I &nbsp;was completely green and I felt cold sweat all over my body and I could feel the hair in my body arising from my skin. I could not take it any more and I just had to get up and shut the woman up.  &nbsp;  My boyfriend was so scared because that same afternoon I told him that if I heard that woman with that dog again in the middle of the night I was going to get out and shut her up. So as soon as my boyfriend heard me taking my clothes our of my drawer he got up and said. “where are you going?” and I just told him “I’m going to shut that woman up that’s what I’m going to do!”  &nbsp;  So I just went outside and I saw the woman for the first time in two days, with her flannel pajama and a sleeping hat and there it was this cute Labrador pup smelling its own old poop and looking for a new fresh place to put his new poop.  &nbsp;  Me: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Excuse me lady, I’m so sorry to disturb you at this time of night, I know it’s late it’s 2:00  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; am but you’re making too much noises and we have to wake up very early in the  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; morning so can you keep your voice down?  &nbsp;  Neighbor: What?  &nbsp;  Me: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keep your voice down, you have been waking us up for two nights in a row now and we  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; need to sleep I’m sorry.  &nbsp;  Neighbor: Oh sure, no problem  &nbsp;  Me: I’m R.E.A.L.L.Y.&nbsp; S.O.R.R.Y.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; T.H.A.N.K.&nbsp; Y.O.U!  &nbsp;  Neighbor: No problem  &nbsp;  When I turned around to get into my apartment I see this woman whom I think it was this woman’s sister looking at me like she wants to have a fight with me. But at that time I was boiling so I just gave her my “I will kill you if you even look at me” look and I said “good evening’ The woman said the same and saw me as I was getting inside.  &nbsp;  I think the one who should have given an apology to me was the neighbor but oh well. She just won a call to the police next time I hear her barking at her dog.  &nbsp;  But that didn’t end there, oh no sir, you think that just because I went outside and shut the woman the night was going to be peaceful? Well it was peaceful for 1 minute because after that a big truck with very very loud country music was passing fast by my block and parked near my window and the owner of the big truck was shouting the name of another guy in another big truck in the corner below.  &nbsp;  That lasted about 1 or 2 hours more.  &nbsp;  Then a patrol car was chasing another car with the sirens on.  &nbsp;  After that the firefighters came along with the sirens on  &nbsp;  And to finish the circus, a midnight concerto starting two male cats fighting over a female cat.  &nbsp;  By then it was 4 am and it was time to get up.  &nbsp;  Did I get rest?  &nbsp;  No  &nbsp;  You think I’m in the mood to work and listen to other people crap at work?  &nbsp;  No  &nbsp;  This time, if I hear one more time the guy sitting next to me whistling a stupid Beatle song. I’m gong to punch him in the face, I swear.  &nbsp;  Tricia, I’m sorry I didn’t take the pictures when I was turning into Hulk but it was too dark and too damn late to look for my Polaroid.  &nbsp;  Probably tonight I’ll be more prepared.  &nbsp;  Have a nice and peaceful weekend everyone.&nbsp; &nbsp;

      This can only happen to Yoli…  &nbsp;  As you all know I now don’t have a car so I have to take the public transportation to get to work. Is no big deal, I just take the taxi that says where I am supposed to go with big huge letters and that’s it.  &nbsp;  So there I was on the bus stop waiting for my taxi to arrive and it was getting late so I started to get nervous as the taxi was not there yet. I saw my taxi coming so I make it stop to get in. There’s an intersection where if we go straight it takes you downtown or if we turn to the right it takes us directly to my work is. The taxi was getting near where it was supposed to make the right turn but the car never turned to the right lane to turn right, and it passed it, I freaked out and I asked the taxi driver  &nbsp;  Me: Aren’t we going to 5 y 10?  &nbsp;  Taxi driver: No, we are going downtown  &nbsp;  Me: But I saw the big sign saying 5 y 10  &nbsp;  Taxi Driver: Nop, it says Downtown (shows me the big ass sign)  &nbsp;  Me: Pull over, I need to get off this thing!  &nbsp;  One of two things could have happened:  &nbsp;  #1 The taxi driver changed the sign as soon as I get getting on the taxi, or…  &nbsp;  #2 I did not read the sign correctly….  &nbsp;  If #2 happened I have to blame the lack of sleep I have not get to have since my boyfriend’s car was stolen because every time I hear a car starting outside my house I freak out and look at the window to see if that was not my car.  &nbsp;  Well this morning that was not the reason why I didn’t get enough sleep. My new neighbors have a dog, a puppy dog which it only makes noises at night when it needs to go poop, so last night at 2:30 am to be exact I could hear my beautiful neighbor trying to make its new puppy poop outside the building…exactly at my window. Actually the dog was really not making any noises but the neighbor was….  &nbsp;  Neighbor: Come on you f…ing dog, poop!  &nbsp;  Dog:……..  &nbsp;  Neighbor: F…ck damn you, you just woke me up for nothing!  &nbsp;  Dog:…..  &nbsp;  Neighbor: Come here you son of a b…ch (obvious)  &nbsp;  At this moment I was starting to get very, very annoyed about the noises this woman was making and I do believe the dog got pissed off too.  &nbsp;  Dog: Dwarf, dwarf, dwarf, dwarf.  &nbsp;  Neighbor: Shut up you fu..in animal and poop!  &nbsp;  Dog: Dwarf!  &nbsp;  Neighbor: No…shut the f..ck up! You’re going to wake up the neighbors (too late!)  &nbsp;  Dog: Grrrr….dwarf!  &nbsp;  Neighbor: Come here you, f…cking piece of s…it!  &nbsp;  Dog: Dwarf!….Huuaauuuhhh Dwarf!  &nbsp;  Neighbor: I said shut the f…ck up!!!! Come here you, let’s take you inside, you just took me here for nothing!  &nbsp;  Poor dog, with that kind of pressure and insulting even I would not poop properly.  &nbsp;  Happy Thursday everyone!

      Why do good people always have the worst luck?...  I am grumpy, I am grouchy, I am annoying, I complain too much I won't deny that, but when it comes to helping out other people when they need it I am always there and my boyfriend is just like that and even more than me, he's just a good samaritan.  But being a good samaritan has its own price and is not pretty; it always comes with bad things on the side.  Yesterday morning as my boyfriend wanted to leave for work he noticed a big big space in the parking...something was missing...his car...  Why I ask, why this has to happen to him? In the worst of the times when he has to support his family who came from their country a few months ago to live in the US and has a big debt in the banks for that reason.   This really pisses me off, it turns me green. I am thinking one of these days I am going to turn like the HULK, I always try to keep things calm when something bad happens to me or my family and I have to keep my mouth shut because that's what a nice person has to do, just accept what it comes and thank the Omnipresent for giving us that big test to prove we are good sons. But I am reaching my limit, oh yes I am, one day I am going to talk, I am going to talk loud and clear so everybody hears me....even YOU!  Why? This is my question today, why? It's not fair, really it is not!  So now I gave my car to my boyfriend to take it to work because he has to drive over 40 miles to get there until he finds a car he can buy, I don't mind taking the public transp. plus I work near home. So I'll look at the possitive side in this disgrace. My boyfriend is picking me after work... Yippiiiii!  Alright, it's not working!  I'm grouchy, so everybody who wants to deal with me today will get some of my "Hulkiness"  Happy Humpday.

      That sounds so mushy…  But it’s true, today I am mushy, sleepy and dreamy at the same time. Is it true that when someone loves someone doesn’t realize it until one day a spark hits them? I don’t know.   I’ve been with my b/f for almost 2 years now and every time someone asked me if I was in love with him or if I loved him I said with my eyes turning somewhere else “sure” but never a “yes I love him so much, he’s the man of my dreams, I want to marry him…” and all that crap I hear from my friends and people, although we live together and it may sound strange but I feel as if he wasn’t there I would not be complete and I must say this doesn’t have anything to do with being used to the other person who sleeps beside you.  Over the weekend I felt something pinching my brain just as we were in the parking lot of a super market and there was a song on the radio “I just called to say I love you”. Just when I realize I was doing something I hate to see the most from others I was doing it in front of lots of people, Boyfriend and I singing the song, looking at each other and feeling happy not caring if others saw or listened to us. But that didn’t last long, I think just for 1 minute, then I shut up and felt over the clouds when my boyfriend was looking at my eyes and me not knowing what to do I replied to his sight.   I think I got carried away by the “Momento” right? I sure hope so.   I have my new Oscar the grouch T-shirt, Woo hoo! And you know what it says?  “SCRAM!”  So if my boss comes to me and asks me about his freaking shocks I will tell him…  “SCRAM!”

        urlLink  You're a circle!       You're a circle. You follow a daily routine that you find exciting and not boring because you can never see around the bend and are always expecting something new, which is very possible. Your two dimensional qualities allow you to view the world as it is, nothing too deep, but whatever you want to see to make yourself feel good inside.    urlLink What Shape Are You?    I found this quizz in Shara's blog where she got it from Derek's blog where I don't know where he got it from but it's neat.  I'm starting to get to like these thingies... he!  If I'm a circle, that's good, I mean I never have an end, my routines are like that, sounds monotonous but it really isn't, I like it, until I get bored then I get another one and so on.   I'm a circle, a little nice round cheerful circle....  Yeah!

      Why me…Why me??!!…  I think the worst thing about a relationship is that not only you get engaged with your partner but also with the inlaws, and “Antisocial Yoli” don’t like to play social with the inlaws.  I’ve told my boyfriend trizzillion times I don’t like to spend more than 30 seconds with his family because of the difference in culture, language, and what not; I know it sounds ugly, bad and horrible but that’s how I am. Saturday we went to buy my boyfriend his new cell phone and he wanted me to help him out choose one. I don’t consider myself cheap, I just consider myself practical and economical and that’s the reason why all my clothes have no international brand names or well known designers like Gucci or Armani, Guess, etc, etc, etc. For me, as long as is a good quality clothe, comfortable, good looking and at a reasonable price is good enough for me. The same goes with everything else I use around me, so with that thought I was looking around for a cheap reliable phone for my boyfriend, well, as expected, we found a nice phone with all those cool gadgets you can find in a phone that even I was drawling for and my boyfriend wanted it. It was the most expensive phone on show, and well, to make the long story short, that’s the phone he got; he’s happy now with his new phone.   Everything was beautiful, like one of those romantic weekends you love to spend with your boyfriend until he mentioned the sentence “Let’s go see my sister” I felt every little hair in my body arose from my skin and felt the “goose bumps”. I wanted to scream, I wanted to run away and get the hell out, but I could not, we were in the freeway at more than 75 miles per hour and that would be completely suicidal for me. So the only thing I could do is put my miserable ugly face like “Do we have to?” and the story began all over again.  Bf: Why what’s wrong? Me: Nothing I just get so bored! Bf: But it will be just for a little bit, I promised my sister I would go over and see her Me: Well how bit will be that little bit? Bf: Just a few minutes, 15 minutes just to stop by and say hello. Me: …  Well actually it wasn’t only 15 minutes, it was 2 hours to be exact, good thing I am starting to understand a little bit of my boyfriend’s language so I could catch up a bit of the conversation he was having with their sisters, and it really wasn’t a good nice chat, it was more like an argument.   Sunday morning, my boyfriend told his sisters he would take them to Balboa Park, for those who know the area of San Diego, CA. and have seen Balboa Park is a very nice park where you can enjoy the culture and relax while watching the nice structures of the museums around, it’s big, with lots and lots of trees and well, if you really want to enjoy it you should walk around every little hidden corner of this Museum/Park; I was excited to go since the last time I was there was 10 years ago. Everything was just as I left it and just a few things got enhanced but the rest was all the same. At this point, hell was about to begin.  I’ve never went with the inlaws anywhere else but their homes or to the beach but never to any other place like a big park or a cultural center and believe me I will never go with them again. It was a nightmare, it was embarrassing and shameful. This place is one of the most beautiful places to go and walk and just breathe the fresh air with lots and flowers and natural living and well in my case I love to walk, and walk, and walk until I loose all sense in my feet and that’s what I wanted to do, but, you know in all the parks there are benches ever 3 feet so, there you saw the whole family (sisters and nephews) sitting almost everywhere; the funniest thing was that they just ate their lunch 1 hour before and when we got out of the car my boyfriend asked me if we could eat inside, I said yeah sure of course, but I never thought they would bring 3 buckets of water, 2 bags of cookies and bread and pistachios and sunflower seeds and god knows what else they were carrying in those bags, as if they were really going to sit down and eat. So we get out of the car and walk towards the park and guess what? There was a place with grass and shade and 2 or 3 people sitting so they went there and sat, I look at my boyfriend and say:  Me: What?! We have lots of things to see! Bf: Yeah I know but let’s just sit down and drink a little bit of water Me: What tha! Bf: Come sit with us and then we keep on walking Me: Alright, you sit here with your family I’ll go walk, I’ll catch you guys later!  That’s how it went the 4 hours we stayed in the park, they were sitting and I was walking, actually I walked the whole park around two times and they were still sitting, not on the same spot no, no, no, they were sitting every 3 feet where they saw benches. “Oh look, one bench and has shade, let’s sit down and eat”. Of course while they were walking the only thing I could hear were my boyfriend’s nephews just mocking at everything they saw, one girl playing the violing “mock, mock, mock” One big building with medieval pictures “mock, mock, mock”. It was very, very, very annoying, to the point I wanted to kick their …. Ok, I’ll calm down now.  And my boyfriend wants to take them all to the Zoo….Yeah right! I’m not spending my share of money waiting for these people to sit, and eat, then get up walk three feet and sit down again and eat while the whole zoo is waiting for me to enjoy. Hell no, that’s no fun at all! People you gotta exercise more! And let’s just say, I am the fatty in the family ok?  So there you have it folks, yes it was a shieety Sunday, which I must say I spent with myself, walking alone all over the precious place because my boyfriend could not let them sit by themselves, oh no, they might get lost…in the bench… Bull…  This morning I am not in a nice mood as you can tell, I have no server, so I can’t work, which means I am delayed now, which means I won’t go home early, which means I’ll be late for everything.   Good thing I have internet…Woo hoo!

      This is driving me nuts…  I few weeks ago I was desperately seeking for some peace and quiet and that my boss would go away and leave me alone at least, now I am anxiously waiting for my boss to come back to work. After the company celebration everybody is so drunk they forget to work, except for me. Everybody is so wasted that everybody wished they were at home, except for me. How sad.  The most annoying thing about eating your lunch is eating it with the plant director and listening to him saying how much money he spent when he went to the Bahamas and how beautiful it is to go on a cruise to the Caribbean or how easily he gets away with any speeding ticket because of the big influences he has with the police in the city, and other crap I preferred to knock my head off ‘cause I got tired of listening to him and reminding me how pathetic my life is that I can’t even go downtown because of my lack of money. And still I want my Oscar the grouch T-shirt, I better start saving.  Anyhow, I have a heartburn, I know I need Pepto but I am not taking it, tastes weird. I’m bored and I am just looking out my big window and counting the chairs the people is picking up from the celebration two days ago, boy they’re a lot, and you can fold them, and stack them, I want to fold one, looks fun, or maybe not, I would have to get up from my chair and start exercising and my stomach is too full to do something like that.   So thanks to the Plant Manager my whole week is ruined, I was cheerful and nice, and actually I was starting to become a nice person but not anymore.  I’ve been checking out one of the girls in my company (one of the Evil Yoli’s) and I think she hasn’t taken a shower for 4 days now, she’s been with the same straight hair since Monday and now her hair looks oily, I want to tell her “Girl, if you don’t have water in your house there are 8 big showers in the company you can take a good, nice and healthy shower you know” “Can I count your lice? Maybe you have a big spider in there and you haven’t even noticed”   How can it be possible that women with curly hair, once they straighten it for the weekend they don’t wash it until the next week? That’s nasty! Don’t they realize people know they don’t clean up their heads? Look at you woman, you don’t even brush it because the hair do might come down and what a waste! Probably you must have spent about 50 to 60 dollars to get your hair straight and you want to make it worth the pay? Here, take a shower in my house and I’ll straight it out for you every morning, just take a freaking shower for crying out loud Woman! If I were a man I would not be near you at least 1 mile. There I said it, of course the social praxis and the political relationship has to keep at a margin (who ever wrote that deserves to die and if it’s already dead, deserves to die again) so that means I can’t say this to her but that’s what the Blogger is for right?   Damn I want to get that head into a big bucket of water with soap and scrub it, deep scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scruuuuuuuuub. Yeah!

      There really can be miracles...  I asked my boyfriend two days ago if the brother in law appeared finally and he said yes but it took him a while to get to the house without letting anyone know he was coming back that day so this is what happened.  The old man got off the airplane and searched around for his family, knowing that he was all left alone in the airport he decided to go alone to find his family so he did the fastest thing he could find. He got a cab and told him "Take me to San Diego, where my family is". So the taxi driver took him.  Two hours and the taxi-meter working, up they went to find his house which he never saw before since he last saw his wife and kids 3 m onths ago. The taxi driver asks for directions and the old man replied " I don't know, but you should look for this place, this big building with lots and lots of doors, it looks like a hotel and it's located somewhere around a bunch of cars".  So the taxi driver took him all around the San Diego area, up, down, left, right, north, south, west, and east, took them about another 2 hours to find the house till he finally go there.  "How much should I pay?" the old man asked. "It's a few hundred dollars" the taxi driver said for what the old man almost died of a heart attack.  But I only have one dollar and a few cents, do you take "Pesos"? the old man asked. The taxi driver looked at him funny and said, "what about that big golden chain you have on your chest?"  The old man had nothing else to do but to hand over the chain.  But the happy ending is that he got home, his wife was cooking dinner, his children were watching TV, they saw him and his wife began shouting at him for being irresponsible enough to not even call when he got there. HEHE  This story is fictitious but it might not be so far from reality.

      This one cracked me up....  My best friend called me at home last night to catch up on our stuff from the weekend and she told me the funniest story.  As she was crossing the border back to TJ she saw two police officers talking to each other and one girl approaching them, so then girl asks them:   Girl:  Excuse me, where's the way to Mexico?   Officers:  (both pointing over the Tijuana border bridge a few steps away)   Girl:  But I just came that way!  If you didn't get it....read it again....  This girl took over the prize for my boyfriends brother in law  "Stupidest person I've ever known"

      I really don’t know how to call this but I thought really stupid people only existed on TV, until yesterday…  #1  I went with my boyfriend to the LA airport to take one of his sisters back to her country, as expected we took around 3 hours to have her checked in.  3 hours? Yes 3 hours. She was carrying over 300 Lbs. of luggage so she had to fix that “little” problem.  #2  My boyfriend asks me if I could help him find his brother in law. ???… He was supposed to be back from his country to LA that same day but he only had the flight number and the approximate time he left his country.  Ok, no problem I said, which airline is he coming from? To which my boyfriend and his other sister replied, “Oh we don’t know, we only know he’s coming today, he left from there at 5 am or 5:30 something like that…”  Ok, then what’s the time he’s supposed to be here? I asked, “Oh we don’t know, the flight time is approximately 16 to 18 hours” So counting with my fingers I though, well maybe he’s already here. Was he making any stops? I asked. “Yes he made a stop in NY and after that he’s coming to LA”  Knowing now that was a hint more to our favor until I asked them, Was he switching planes at that stop. To which they replied, “Oh we don’t know, maybe he just waited a couple of hours there and then the plane left” So was what should we do? Wait at the International arrivals or at the National arrivals?  By now I was green as green as HULK, for what I told my boyfriend. How someone be so stupid to not give the exact information? I mean, is more than obvious.  Only one thing was left to do and I was not going to be the one doing it. Ask airline by airline National and International if there was an Arab guy coming in an airplane that left 5 ish or so with an 11 hour difference or we don’t know. Which would take one person about 2 hours in that huge messy airport. If you know the LA international airport, you will know what I’m talking about.  Of course nobody wanted to do it so we just all went back home…to wait, but before that we went around the Coronado bridge and drink slurpies...  So if you hear or see in the news there’s one Arab old man missing and crying for his family at the LA airport, please let me know, I opened a special phone line for him 01-800-HESO-DUH  Now that is what I call a very, very, very stupid family.  Happy Monday every one!

      Yup...  And it's not because I'm busy (actually I have nothing to do today); it's because my brain is so drained and empty right now I can actually hear my own dust mites talking to each other.   It's kind of fun....wee!  So while I stop this insanity (I hope it doesn't take too long) I'll put myself on "Stand by"mode....for today only, and the rest of the weekend too, don't get so excited.  I think these little creatures are trying to do something against me like give me a cold or a rash...nah!  Happy Weekend everyone!

      After a hard week of work…  I won, yes I won, but it’s not a car, or a house or a trip to the tropical islands, no, I won a big fat heart burn, I never knew what a heart burn was until yesterday afternoon. I think it was to be expected one of these days, I mean I am always on the run for everything, especially the past week.  After the 1001 things I had pending I could only finish up 2 or 3 so I still have 900 and something things pending to go, but I won’t bother worrying, I’ve had enough for one week.  So I suppose these are the few things that probably created a heart burn for me:  My parents are coming over in 3 weeks and the apartment that I rented for them was supposed to be ready by last week but the building Admin. Didn’t pay much attention to my requests (I know now) ‘cause the carpets are not yet replaced, the kitchen wall is still with the cement on full glow and the closet is completely destroyed. But they have a new boiler.  My car was making weird noises every time I made a turn, if it was to the left the car would make noises on the right side, if I turned the car to the right, it would make noises on the left side. I took it to the mechanic and had to change the whole front suspension because both shafts were broken. Besides that, I had to wait over 2 hours after the time they told me the car would be ready so I had to stay in the reception area talking to an old lady who was whispering every word; how can she think I can listen with all that noise going around that shop? I was hoping she didn’t ask me anything because then I would be in trouble, why? Cause the old lady was the owner of the mechanic shop.  The fixture was way too expensive it almost gave me a heart attack right there when they told me how much I had to pay.  I had plans to go shopping for my parents new apartment on Sunday so I asked my BF if he would be back earlier and he said he would be back around 1 or 2 pm but he would call me first. Well it was 9 pm and he had not called in yet and there went my Sunday.  It was almost midnight on Sunday and I heard a dog barking, it was a pit bull then I heard a very loud scream, it was coming from that old hobo dog that has been sleeping in front of my apartment door every since the neighbor fed it. The Pitt Bull dog almost killed it, I was in shock and I couldn’t sleep last night.  My heart burn is not completely gone but at least I can walk straight, so I guess I’m doing better.  Damn what a week!  And this week doesn’t look any prettier.
