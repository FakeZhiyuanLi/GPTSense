      I gave in yesterday; I called M. I was sitting there wanting to talk to him so badly, and I thought he might be feeling the same way. I could picture us both eternally staring at the phone, too scared to make the move. I decided I would be the one to break the silence.  I cried and sobbed and wailed and played the perfect fool. It always seems that way during a breakup; there's one that just won't accept things. While during the breakup I was the strong comforting one, this time it was M. He's going through some genuine problems right now. He has no sense of who he is at all, maybe he even knows himself less that I know him.   He really does need the space, he really doesn't want to be the cause of all this pain. I understand that, I hope he works things out. Right now I'm still sad, but I'm also optimistic. It's gotten me this far, right? I'm still certain we're meant to be together.

      Normally today would be the highlight of my week, but today is about pain. Saturdays are the days that M and I shared time with each other. We would usually just sit in bed for hours talking, we never got tired of each other and we had the best conversations. I'm not angry today, I'm not making up crazy scenarios in my head, I'm just so damn lonely and sad.   It's so hard to see why he thinks this is the right thing to do. He said we'd be better of, he said we never really needed him anyway. He really doesn't know how deeply in love I was, still am. He doesn't know how much J looked up to him.  Who could abandon thier best friend and lover and think that it's the right thing to do?

      Wow, I cried last night and this morning, and I think I may cry again at any second. Somehow I don't feel as bad, though. Maybe I'm accepting this, maybe I'm at another stage of my grieving. It's still hard to eat, I've lost something like three pounds this week.  Cosmopolitan says that if a guy isn't ready to make a commitment after being in a relationship for several years he really isn't in love. I guess that's food for thought.   The female mind is a scary thing. Mine makes up all kinds of weird scenarios. I think things like "what if he was lying and he did dump me for another chick", even though I know that's really unlikely. I get angry too, I think things like "he's a selfish coward"; but two seconds later I'm wondering what I might have done to drive him away.

      Morning Entry:  I woke up feeling quite calm this morning, it didn't last. Oh and I cried last night, dammit. I never thought about how often I would call M to let him know about this cool thing or that. Now just as I'm thinking "oh I have to tell M..." I remember that I can't, and that's one of the hardest things to deal with.  Eep, I just got an invitation to lunch by mutual friends, and M is invited too. Should I answer privately or reply-all? Is M going to reply? I wish I had some regular readers of this journal who could post comments and tell me what to do. I think I'll wait and see if M replies. Maybe if I reply that I can't go and add a little sad-face it'll let him know how I feel.      A bit later:  Alright, M responded to the email with "Grr…can’t today but I wish I could…". WTF? You wish you could gorge yourself on Chinese food when I am in so much pain eating takes a force of will? *Deep breath* Alright, maybe I'm reading too much into just 8 words; but that's really the first thing that went through my head.

      I thought it would be nice to share my memories of the good times with M, like how we first met:  It was November, I had just moved to a new town and was attending a small computer college. It was the day I was scheduled to write my exam for my Cisco CCNA certification. I had just ended a relationship about a month earlier but was pretty career focused at the time and wasn't really thinking much about dating.   I passed my exam (the results are instant)! Oh joy, oh bliss! Excited, I walked up to the reception desk to get the printout of my test scores. There he was, standing at the secretary's desk. I thought he was kinda cute looking, but I also thought he was trying to get a date with the secretary - he was nagging her to go get some lunch with him. We exchanged some words, he congradulated me on my exam, and I left.   I got just as far as the elevator when I realized I had left my purse in the testing room. I walked back to the school and got my bag, M was still there bothering the secretary for a date. When I left M followed, we chatted some more in the elevator on the way from the 8th floor to the ground floor. I was really hoping he was going to offer to take me to lunch to celebrate my success, but he didn't.   And that was it, that was our first meeting. Fate brought us together again later on, but we both remembered that first meeting very clearly. Oh, and it turned out he wasn't hitting on the secretary. He worked in an office adjacent to hers and they had been close friends for some time. He later told me he really had no reason to take the elevator at that time, other than the fact that he was interested in me, and he also wished he had asked me out to lunch!

      I really want to have a reason to call or email M, but I know I shouldn't. I went so far as to check his profile on  urlLink slashdot  to see if he had made any recent comments. I saw an interesting article and wanted to email him about it because no one else I know would "get it". I keep hoping for the phone to ring or for there to be a knock on the door. I want to tell him how wrong this is, how we're so meant for each other. I feel so pathetic, like those wussy lovesick girls who write really crappy poetry.   I think the website is helping, it's hard to tell. I can be fine for a while and then an instant later be in pain again.  I have so much to do right now, I need to find the drive to get it all done. I'm taking a night class at a local university and have a mid-term exam tonight, and a project due on the weekend. I'm moving in less than a week and have to get my things packed. On top of that I have a full time job and a daughter to raise. Normally I can handle it but this whole situation is starting to make it overwhelming.   My friend is watching my daughter tonight while I'm at class. She lives right across the street from M. I wonder if he'll see my car while I'm there, I wonder if he'll see me. I wonder if I'll catch a glimpse of him, I wonder if I could keep my composure if I did. I wish I could make this insane little trains of thought go away.

       Day one was technically yesterday so this is somewhat post-dated.    The day was understandably tough. There was a lot to reflect on and it was hard having to pretend that everything is alright around everyone at work. I wrote down some of my thoughts on paper, they ranged in feeling from anger to sadness to acceptance.   I find my mind drifting off to thoughts of M a lot and it makes my chest tight. I don't seem to have much ambition. I still feel hungry and I still feel sleepy but I just don't have the desire to act on those impulses. I haven't cried today but I've come close, I'm really not much of a crier anyway.

      I've been dumped. It's not someone else, that might have been easier to accept. He didn't know if it was really love, and he said he couldn't move our relationship further because he was afraid to. I have a daughter, so I come as a package deal; a ready-made family if you will. That is what he couldn't deal with. He thought it would be better for us if we just ended it now.  He couldn't see himself changing, and didn't think it fair that I be made to wait.  He seemed genuinely distraught during the breakup. I've never in four years seen him cry until then. Though every possible emotion I could have been feeling was hurling through my mind at the time, I remained calm. I tried to understand where he was coming from, what he was feeling. Perhaps I could accept it so easily because it what he was saying was so honest. He said he didn't want to loose me as a friend. I told him he should take some time apart from me and my daughter and focus inward on himself.   So that is where I am now. I guess you could just call it time apart, but it may well turn out to be final. I'm not ready to tell any of my friends or family, even my daughter, that the relationship may be over. Until I am sure things are finished with us I'll journal my thoughts and feelings here.

      Ugh, I dragged myself to work today and managed to slug my way through a pile of email. I'm really starting to question the efficiency and/or work ethic of some of my coworkers. If I check my statistics vs. theirs I almost always seem to be doing twice as many tickets in the same time frame. Granted, phone support takes longer than email and everyone has thier own pace...*shrug*.  Jasmin had ANOTHER fiasco at day camp today. That's two incidents in two days, not a good sign. I know she doesn't take change well but I'm also really not sure if her meds are working. If this continues I'll have to ask my parents to watch her during the week or something. I think having to spend four hours at work with me was punishment enough for today.   When Jasmin and I got home Jeff just happened to be driving by as we were getting out of the car. He pulled over and invited us for ice cream! Ok, so he more invited Jasmin than me, is that weird? My friend D tells me he might like me but I think he likes Jasmin more. I dunno, but it doesn't feel like a phony "be nice to the kid to get with the mom" thing, so I'm content.

      I saw the doctor today about my stomach troubles, he said it's probably just gastro-something-something and gave me a bunch of free antacid. I guess that means I'm back at work tomorrow, then off again on a four-day weekend!   I'm watching the Henry VIII movie on CBC and wondering if all people did back then was lurk around corners, waiting to overhear something they can use to further thier own ambitions. It's so much more treaterous than today; now we have cameras and instant-replay.

      I managed to get myself to the voting station with J in tow. I registered, got my ballot and did my civic duty. On the way out, J asked "when are you going to vote, mom?". "I just did, honey" I replied. She pondered for a minute and commented "that's just boring mom". I chuckled and agreed, thinking back to the past few weeks; the constant media circus and millions of dollars of campaign money spent only to prompt me to make a little black x with an HB pencil...

      Here I am, just finished a weeks vacation, and I'm taking a sick day. Am I going to get passive-aggressive guilt trips at work tomorrow? Definately.   So the barbeque at J's house was fun, but he was overly generous in the wine he offered me. I'm going to be talking to my doctor about this, but it seems that if I have more than two drinks I end up nauseous for several days afterwards. I'm sure that can't be a good thing, please don't let it be my kidney.  I only have one kidney, though by now it's increased in size enough that I can hold my water as well as anyone. Despite being born well past my due date, my right kidney had never properly formed. At five my kidney became infected and had to be removed. Then at six I had another operation to adjust a tube in my bladder to ensure proper drainage. The second operation was much harder on me than the first and apparently I spent several days in the ICU, but I remember nothing of it. My childhood was plaqued with continous urinary infections and I was told I should not swim in chlorine-treated water, a harsh sentence to take when you're ten. But here I am now, healthy as anything for the most part and doing my best to take care of my precious remaining kidney. Without it I would be subject to dialysis machines for hours at a time, several days a week.  Oh and for my readers from Freddy Beach, I've heard there is a free yoga class Monday evenings at the lighthouse on the green. Sorry, I haven't heard what time it is held.

      Fahrenheit 9/11 was as amazing as expected. I was angry, sad, and angry again. I hope this movie reaches a wide audience before the US elections. There is a mother of an american soldier in a large part of the film, and as a mother I found her story really hit home.   We weren't the only ones from Fredericton at the movie either, there were two (nice looking) guys sitting just ahead of myself and my friend D. They started up a conversation just before the movie started, and I was hoping we could continue it afterwards but they took off.   Well this is my last Saturday for a while with free babysitting (thanks grandma). I'm invited to a barbecue in my neighborhood, hosted by a very nice and attractive guy who just happens to be crazy about kids. Is that fate I smell? LOL, don't worry faithful readers, I am giving myself adequate rebound time before making any moves towards a new relationship.

      Here's a pic of myself infront of the marsh near my parents' cottage. Not my best day but I clean up well, trust me.      Oh and jaymi: thanks for commenting, I read your blog too!

      I'm just back from the cottage and in 15 minutes will be running out again to see a free concert in officers' square (hopefully not cancelled due to rain). I have pics from the wilderness that I will have to share later on.   I cannot BELIEVE that the Fredericton theatre is not playing Fahrenheit 9/11. God FORBID they play anything controversial in this town! Nonetheless, I will be driving my fuel-efficient Toyota to Moncton to hopefully get a seat at one of the evening showings there tomorrow.

      Reason 2944 why I love my town: free classic movies on Sunday nights. For those living in the Fredericton area, the city is showing classic movies every Sunday at 9PM on an outdoor screen near the officers' barracks/library.   On Sunday D and I saw "The Italian Job", 1969 version. It was pretty funny, and I loved the little cars they used in the chase scene. There was also a short independant film from a local film maker that was pretty amusing; "Tie Your Laces".  A word of advice to those who venture out: dress very warmly and bring blankets. I could have made use of some mittens as well.

      This breakup is like that movie "Lost in Translation"; there's very little dialog, when there is it's dry, and the whole thing seems to drag on forever. I call M to tell him I have his cat basket and this is the dialog:  Me: "Hi, I've got your cat basket, can I bring it over" M: "Oh, I guess this isn't really a good time" Me: "But it will only take a minute and you're already home" M: "Yeah but... blah blah blah ...Panama"  Me: "Did you say Panama?" M: "Yeah they say I can go now" Me (internal dialogue): "WTF?" Me: "What the fuck?" M: "Oh yeah, I didn't tell you... blah blah blah ...going to Panama for a work thing." Me: "Oh, I see" M: "So I went out last night and now I'm scrambling trying to find my passport" Me: "Well that's alright, you can just call me or something some other time when you have more time" M: "Yeah maybe next Saturday, I think my plane comes back Saturday" Me: "Okay, have fun"  That is really honestly the just of the conversation, and I'm very proud for being nice and trying to bear no ill-will towards the BIG BIG JERK WHO'S A BIG MEAN MEANIE! *ahem* There was really no reason I needed to know he had been out Friday night, I'm sure it was a jab. I'm glad I didn't play the game and see who's having a wilder single life, and I'm not out to even compete in that game. He can have the club scene and I'll stick to the pub scene.

      Despite the rain, and despite my illness I went out on the town last night with my friend D. We took a spin around the tannery to see what was happening, and where, then decided to shuffle off to The Snooty Fox for a drink. I like the atmosphere of TSF, lots of wood panelling and pretty dark. Oh, and they make an incredible pork sandwich, which I didn't have this time in. Our bartender was very nice, he made my ceasar a bit too spicy but topped it up with some extra Clamato for me later.   Afterwards we walked through the rain back to the tannery. Now to digress for a minute. Maybe I'm showing my age, or maybe I'm just showing my IQ, but what kind of retard wears a mini skirt, strappy sandals, and a tank top out at night when it's cold and raining, and nothing else? It's not like I was wearing a rain slicker and gum rubber boots, but there's a line somewhere between stylish and sensible right?  Back on topic.   We ended up at Dolans where a band called Flat Top was playing, hope I got the name right - maybe it's al one word? The mood of the place was very upbeat. It seemed that everyone was having a good time, and it was nice to groove to the music and feed off the good vibes. I ran into someone from my home town, she was with one of the band members. She looked incredible; younger than me though she's one or two years my senior. She was practically glowing and seemed genuinely happy and friendly. It's nice to run into people like that from "back home". Much better than people who dig for information until they're satisfied that they're doing better than you.   A great night, and now it looks like it will be a great day.

      Hahaha, I won! Armed with my trusty fork I scooped the last of the felt-like guacamole sheets out of the drain. It didn't go easy, it was making some nasty slime trails, but I overcame! I celebrated with a hearty warm shower.

      I took a deep breath and plunged back into the bathroom. This time I was armed with a fork and a scub-brush, and thought to turn the fan on. I filled the bowl halfway with very hot water and managed to scrape about 90% of the putrid black woolly growth into the toilet. The last of the organic matter was easily brushed away with soapy water.   I have triumphed over the bowl but though the battle is won, the war wages on. I now face the remains of my enemy in the bathtub. I think it has a strategic advantage. It knows I have only two options; push it down the drain it is poised so precariously near, or scoop it into some sort of transfer vehicle and have it join its' fallen comrade in the toilet. I could turn on the water to try and flush some of it away, but I risk the possibility that the tub will fill up and the scum will spread itself around. I must prevail, I want to take a shower.

      I heard once from a very reliable source (CSI, original series) that smiling will inhibit the gag reflex. It might work well enough for perfectly groomed actors surrounding a plastic corpse in a fake bodybag, but it does nothing in real life when you're dealing with a bowl of week-old guacamole.   If it was in any other bowl I would toss it. Okay so I took it to the bathroom and started to rinse it out in the bathtub. Unfortunately the fuzzy black stuff that the guacamole has mutated into came off in sheets and started to clog the drain. This is when my stomach started to loose structural integrity and I had to make my exit.  Guacamole - 1 Amy - 0

      This whole sad saga should be over shortly. I'm not only tired of writing about my feelings, I'm finding less to write about. I have so much more to share; thoughts on politics, the environment, comic books.   So Saturday I will return the cat carrier to M and say "Adieu". Buddists say that ill-will towards people is a negative force we should be wary of, so I'm going to make a concentrated effort to be especially nice and watch what I say. If I think this "new M" is only going to find emptiness in his new lifestyle I will keep it to myself (and my weblog).   I'm excited about the prospect of camping next week, and I think I have a lot to look forward to this summer. I think I might try getting out and meeting new people. I'm certainly not interested in a new relationship right away, but I'm not averse to dating. I created a profile on  urlLink lavalife.com  yesterday and had about 5 smiles within a few hours! Granted, some of these guys were over fourty but still it's a nice ego boost. If you'd like to see my profile on lavalife my username is _paprika_.

      M called me. He wants his cat carrier back, he's willing to trade for a carboy full of rhubarb wine. I suppose that's alright, though I'm still bitter about the lack of birthday present. Jerk.  I told him I don't really want to maintain contact after we've swapped these posessions, he didn't seem to like that idea. I'm sure he'd like to be able to be friends and hang out and have conversations like we used to, but that's not my bag.   This person that he suddenly wants to become has a lot to do with the people he's started to associate with at work; they've finally started to assimilate him. M works at a call center and most of the people in this peer group are young singles. So now he's giving up classical piano and starting to "run" in the mornings; can anyone say desperate grab at youth? I don't want anything to do with someone leading such a shallow lifestyle, and I don't want to be the one he turns to when he wants to have a meaninful and intelligent conversation. Sorry boy; you lay down with dogs, you get up with fleas.

      Wow, twenty days, it seems so unreal. I bought a self-help book on Saturday at a used book store. It wasn't a "how to get him back" book, it's called "After you Say Good-Bye". I skimmed it that day and took some really good ideas from it. There are a lot of things I've been doing, or thinking of doing, that really only serve to sabotage my healing process. I'm quite guilty of constantly checking up on M, even just to drive by his house to see if his car is parked there. I contimplated calling one of his friends to dig for information, I'm glad I didn't.  So then Saturday I threw a party to celebrate my 25th birthday. I surrounded myself with friends, family, and coworkers and drank way too much. It was a blast and I feel so much better about myself, not that I usually have a problem feeling good about myself.   Sunday was mostly spent recovering from Saturday. I drove a friend home and on my way back, driving through the countryside, I wept for the four great years that are now at an end. I sobbed and wailed remembering how M used to read to me in the park. It's hard to describe how I felt, I don't think it was sadness or despair, it was just release.

      I want to buy a self-help book, but I can't decide between a book on "getting over it" or "how to get him back".   I hate him for abandoning me and everything we have together, and I love him and want him to figure out who he is.   I want to cut him out of my life completely, move far far away, and start over. That's usually what I do at the end of a relationship, I've never stayed friends with any of my exes. Things are just so much easier that way.

      Two days without an update, my readership will surely suffer. Actually I was busy moving, and my internet at home still hasn't been setup properly. The stress of the move has kept me busy enough to take my mind off M for awhile, but not permanently.  I watched Shrek 2 with J last night, cartoons are horribly depressing when you're suffering from a breakup. Fuck happy endings.

      Jasmin is home for the night, it's nice to be a mom again. Even when she's arguing with me over the stupidest thing I'm glad to have her back. Lemme tell you some things about my Jazzy:      She prefers to be in sock feet, even when outdoors.     She likes fart jokes and Sponge Bob Squarepants.      I think she's a dog person, but gets along fine with cats too.  She will actually go to bed when she's tired of her own accord, something I'm not certain a lot of kids do.     She doesn't like strawberries, but likes my strawberry jam.   She got some treats today for being good at Gramma's this week. One of the things I got her was a pair of costume fairy wings; I snagged them at a yard sale for $1. She choose those wings over candy, clothes, and a comic book. She's been wearing them all afternoon; to the store, out for a bike ride. She wore them while we watched Peter Pan (great movie) and pretended she was Tinkerbell. LOL, she's definately my girl.

      Yesterday was perfect. We finally got some summer weather, and I was able to take full advantage of it. Working for the Canadian Forces has it's perks, as 'morale' and 'quality of life' are words tossed around frequently. Yesterday they meant our commanding officer sent every non-essential personnel home at noon!  I was preparing to spend the afternoon at home, primping myself for a dinner date later, but the guy I was not expecting to see until dinner skipped out from work early so we could head to Mactaquac for some swimming. Well I guess I did all the swimming, and not very much, but it was the best place to spend a sunny afternoon. Later he made me the most fabulous dinner, yes I said HE made ME dinner. We talked about EVERYTHING, he showed me some Aikido moves, we stopped at a yard sale, I met his brother and his friend Chris, and we topped the evening off with a moonlight walk and some ice cream. I drove home with a sweet, soft goodnight kiss on my lips and I was so wiped out I fell immediately asleep.  That man made me feel like the luckiest, most special girl in the world last night. I think I'm smitten. Is smitten the right word? From urlLink  m-w.com :  "5: CAPTIVATE, TAKE  smitten  with her beauty>"  That I can go with. But then...

      Oh my goodness, I was totally in a car accident! I had Denyelle in the car and we were heading to the superstore for groceries during rushhour and some lady rear-ended me on Dundonald Street. Being so packed in, I hit the car ahead of me as well.     We were lucky there was an off-duty cop just around the corner who came and helped us move our cars and told us what information to have on hand. An officer showed up and wrote out the report.     Nobody was badly hurt and no air bags went off, thank goodness. My poor friend Denyelle has just finished recovering from injuries suffered at another car accident over a year ago, and so this immediately brought back her whiplash. I had some mild discomfort about an hour after the accident. We both wanted to get checked out right away so we sat at emergency for about three hours just to be told to take some Advil.     Both of my car bumpers are messed up now, hopefully there's nothing else that isn't immediately apparent. The lady that hit me was driving a Volvo, and surprisingly she took more damage than I did. My bumpers both shifted the force of the impact out to the sides, the ends jut out on each side now. On her car, the front light was all smashed out and her hood was pushed up considerably.     I've made the report to my insurance company, and they said the adjuster will be calling tomorrow. Hopefully this won't be a fiasco, I really don't need that right now.

      I just watched Audrey Hepburn in 'Roman Holiday'. People often watch these films and think 'isn't that quaint' and 'wasn't it simpler then'. Perhaps it was, but why isn't it now? Isn't the world today one made of our collective will? Isn't this progress? Aren't things better today?    Oh to be like Audrey; charming, demure, delicately feminine. In the movie she has all the power she wants at her command, but it doesn't fulfill her. And him, the leading man; hard, focused, selfish. Suddenly he finds his heart softened by her young enthusiastic spirit. I'm not afraid to admit it; it's what I want.     Fuck you feminism; I have my career and my house and thank you for that. I thank you for the right to vote. But it is my choice to want to be with a tall and dashing man. To want to cook for him and look nice for him. It is not wrong that I want to groom myself, to look pretty like a girl should be!     Fuck you mainstream media; I do not have to show my ass crack to be beautiful. I do not want your metrosexual with his 5 o'clock shadow and faded jeans. I do not want your whiny, 'my dick is small and I masturbate too much' professing emo boy.     As with everything else it seems, I refuse to take sides. I will find my leading man, and I will define my life and my relationships on my own terms. Amen and praise be to me!

      The financing on my house has been approved; fate again turns me in a new direction. These next weeks will be very busy, I'm sure.    This weekend was fantastic. On Friday I packed the camping gear and headed out to the cottage. With my aunt, uncle, and two cousins visiting sleeping space in the cottage was at a premium, so Jasmin and I setup the cots and sleeping bags and slept in the tent. Our supper on Friday was interrupted by a local woman who wanted to ensure we were aware of the bears in the area, and for us not to have any food with us in the tent. Needless to say my sleep was a bit restless. My dad made us feel a bit more secure by ensuring the fire outside the tent was smoldering and smoking for most of the night, and mom supplied us with pots and spoons to bang for scaring away any clawed invaders.      It was terrific to see my aunt Judy again and converse with someone within my own family interested in environmental and social causes. We shared opinions on home schooling vs. the public system, and protesting with action vs. protesting with intellect.     On Saturday I made Chinese food for the whole gang and the four younger girls in the family entertained us with a movie they had made. Maybe I'm getting old and sappy already but hanging out with family was pretty cool.     I had to leave today with some very stern words for Jasmin, as she's been acting up aggressively towards my brother. I don't know how we're going to control this, I don't know if the drugs are making it better or worse. I'm going to have to make another call to Dr. Stickles, and perhaps make a plea to mental health to get Jasmin to see a professional sooner than planned.  Oh, and I think my cat has a limp. Is the weekend really over?

      Well I was supposed to see some family yesterday but that's been postponed. My Aunt Judy is the youngest of my Dad's family, and a free-thinker. She's a vegetarian, home-schooling, baha'i free-spirited wonder-mom and I look up to her a lot. Unfortunately she's also kind of random and spontaneous so though we expected her to arrive early yesterday we still hadn't heard from her at 4PM.     If all goes well her family and mine will all be at the cottage tonight. I've offered to make some chinese food; veggie pot stickers, veggie spring rolls, and ma po tofu. I suppose if I have time I could get some green onions at the local vegetable stand and make some onion cake too. It will be nice to spend a few days at the cottage again, I expect to be back early Sunday with lots to reflect on.     Apparently in the time I've been out of the blogging world, the  urlLink Friday Five  has ceased to be. Luckily I found a  urlLink livejournal community for Friday Five enthusiasts . So here goes, I wish I had picked different questions!!     1) Do you remember your first kiss?       Yes, but it was anything but memorable.    2) How old were you when you had your first kiss?       I would guess about 12.    3) Where did your first kiss occur?       Just outside the junior high school (before they started calling them 'middle' school), after a dance.   4) Where do you think is the most romantic place to exchange a kiss? (locations, not body parts)       At the door, because you never know when a parting kiss may be the last memory you have of a person.   5) What type of kisser are you? (peck, smooch, French, sloppy, etc.)       Ok this is the one I didn't want to answer. I confess, I am a bad kisser. I never really learned the right way to kiss, and at present I avoid it when I can. I guess most times I try to get away with just a peck. And yes, I have seriously considered buying one of those 'how to kiss' booklets. I'm really more of a hands-on learner though, maybe I can find a tutor. *winks*

      Remember the house I was in love with? Well it looks like it might be mine! Mom and Dad have agreed to help me with the downpayment, with the additional stipulation that this is the last time I get to borrow big money from them.     Yesterday I wrote up my offer at lunch. I think I was pretty reasonable; I asked for appliances, window coverings, and that the oil tank be topped-up. I bid a number a bit below the asking price. By dinnertime the counter-offer had come back: all appliances, window coverings, whatever oil is left in the tank since they just topped it up two weeks ago, and they only upped my bid by $1000! OMG I was jumping up and down when I heard that!!! I think I really lucked in there, but I also have to give credit to my realtor. Apparently the owners were somewhat attached to thier stove and washer/dryer; but my realtor convinced them to give me a break since I'm a new homeowner.     One big hurdle left to go; financing. I see the mortgage broker today after work and should know by weeks-end if I'm approved. Wow then it's inspection, lawyers, and I have to find a boarder for the third bedroom. I think I'm going to make a deal with my friend D to come live with us, and only ask for enough to get by comfortably.     Wow this is a lot to absorb in a short period of time! Everything seems to be on an upswing now for me, I'm a lucky girl.

      Can anyone finish that song? I think you need to be the mother of an eight year old to get that. :-|    Another fabulous day! I started off with a big breakfast; bacon, eggs, toast, and orange juice. I started reading one of my new magazines,  urlLink LiP . It's thier premier issue and it looks really promising. The first and only article I got through before  urlLink Phil  decided my magazine was a good place for a nap was an article about preserving water from privatization. One of the names mentioned in the article was Dr. Vandana Shiva, who I recognized from the documentary series "The Corporation". I'm very intriqued by her and want to learn more about her; maybe I'm looking for a new role model.    I got to meet some terrific new people in the afternoon, and had a yummy dinner at Rye's. Following that I worked up quite a sweat at softball practice, and I've just returned from the Sunday movie downtown. This evenings' movie was "High Noon", a western. The sheriff was a mans' man and the ladies wore bonnets. It didn't have a happy ending per se, just an ending. I can't wait for next week, because they're playing a film with Audrey Hepburn!

      Wow what a great day! I got to the market early and it was BRIMMING with great produce. I picked up some peas in the pods, broccolli, onions, new potatoes, salad, oh and smoked bacon from Mulders!     We (D and I) walked to Queen St. to check out the comic shop and the fountain was filled with bubbles. I had a blast scooping them up and throwing them into the air. D looked on; still too self conscious to do anything so silly, but I got her to play a bit. Then we realised it was getting late and the comic shop wasn't going to open until 10, so we had to leave.     We drove all the way northside for her sisters' yard sale where I bought a hammock contraption for $5. After than we rushed home because I had a coffee date with someone. Wow that was a busy morning!    In the afternoon D and I went back into town for comics, I bought a new sketchpad and pencils at endeavors, and then I stocked up on groceries at the Friendship store. The Friendship store has the BEST tofu, IMHO, and the container it comes in is reusable and a good size. I bought veggie potstickers, which are rare to find there, and a bunch of other frozen dim-sum.     Once home with the groceries unpacked I went for a bike-ride and finished the last episode of 'Last Exile', a really great anime series. D and I once again ventured out in the evening to see Anchorman; very funny. I'm topping the night off by reading comics in bed, how perfect!

      Can that really be the sun? Nothing beats getting off work early when the sun is out! I think this calls for an impromptu bike ride along the river.     I've heard the movie "Anchorman" is really funny, I'd like to see it tonight but I haven't been to a movie alone, well, ever! I don't know what would make me feel more like a reject; sitting at home alone with my cat or sitting in a public movie theatre with a tray of nachos.    Hey did you know that when kids spend hours in front of the TV they grow up to be unhealthy adults? Yeah no kidding, a bunch of scientists had to do research to figure that one out!  urlLink Here's the CBC story . I love the caption under the first picture: "TV advertising tends to promote an unhealthy diet." Way to understate the obvious guys!

      I'm in love with  urlLink a house , again. This will be my second love of the year.     I used to walk by this house when I lived on Needham and there were always cats in the front sunporch. I got to meet those cats, and the owners. The owners were super nice and talked a lot about all the work they've put into the house. It really shows, the pictures don't do it justice at all. This house is VERY fairly priced, and doesn't appear to need any major work (foundation, insulation, electric, windows, or roof). There is income potential too, from a small bedroom in the back with a private entrance; I'd have to share the bathroom but with a properly screened tenant I think it would be perfectly fine.    So I called mom and told her about the house, I need some help with a downpayment. I hate to ask because my parents still haven't been able to sell thier house back in Florenceville. I know they'll help if they can, even if they have to scrape pennies to do it. I really find them the most inspirational, sacrificing parents ever.

      I earned my nickname on the softball team today: Shitty Pants.   Let's go back a bit to set the tone of this story...I recently treated myself to some new workout clothes; a flattering sleeveless navy-blue tank top and white shorts. I bought the white shorts specifically because they were so impractical, don't ask what strange thoughts rambled through my mind that day!  So I arrive at the ball field in my stylin outfit, what a gorgeous hot day! I cross the street only to be met with a small ditch between myself and the ball field. I was so pumped to do well at practice I didn't notice the bit of water that lay just around the roots of the tall grass until I was right on top of it. Trying to dodge the water last-minute I of course slipped and landed in the mud and grass and stagnant dirty water right on my ass. My pristine white shorts were soaked and muddy, and me with no change in the car. On standing up the first comment made, by my coach no less, was "Gees Amy what'd ya shit yerself?". Thus my nickname was decided. With every bit of pride I could muster I continued on with the practice, muddy wet shorts and all. I had a blast.   I was disappointed to see that the downtown clasic movie was not showing tonight, was it not rained out yesterday? Can anyone fill me in on this?  Oh and a special hello goes to space_coyote from paprika! *wink*

      I had a date on Friday. It still feels funny to say that, haha. Amy's first date! LOL!  Okay so now I realise I have no idea what the rules of dating are. We met at a Saint Cinnamon downtown; there was live music there too so that was cool. I delicately picked at a cinnamon bun with a fork while he sipped on a coffee and we chatted about various topics. I think I did most of the talking, but then I don't think there would have been any conversation if I didn't. He seemed nice enough, and knew a few people that I also know, and he had a nice smile. On the downside he didn't seem to have an opinion about anything, or have any passions...maybe I just didn't find the right topic. Anyway it might be nice to catch a movie or some pool with him sometime.   Now here's my dilemna, what is supposed to occur at the end of a first date? Does the no kissing rule still apply? Should there be a handshake or something? I ended up just kinda staring at my feet for a minute and then turned on my heels and walked to my car. I'm not sure if that was the right thing to do? Anyway he's still talking to me so I couldn't have done THAT bad.

      Interesting day today, went something like this:     Was told I'm going to be taught the tedious and monotonous task of making hundreds of cables for our new telephone center at work. NEUTRAL  Waited around for the person who was going to teach me to make said cables and then at 11AM was told to go to lunch and come back at 1. Two-hour lunch break: GOOD  Was spending the two hour lunch break by the water, very peaceful. Suddenly the cell phone rings. Jasmin is having an incident at the day camp again: BAD  Show up at the day camp to collect my child. Was told not to bring her back, and to collect a refund for the remainder of the week at the main office: BAD  Have half a day off work on a beatiful sunny day: GOOD  Ring up Jeff. Jeff is off work and taking care of a friends' dog, and this is probably an opportunity to hang out and go boating. Yeah I'm not very good at punishing my kid. I get a call back after a bit and sure enough, he's got the boat and the dog and would love to take us out. It was a short trip but my gosh it was fun. I just love the water. Now I'm lusting for a sailboat again! GOOD  Appointment at dental surgeon to talk about my wisdom teeth. Will require all four wisdom teeth surgically extracted for a total cost close to $1000: BAD  Grab a quick bite to eat and head out to softball game where I make a wrather good hit: GOOD    I have tomorrow off too, Jasmin and I have an appointment at the mental health clinic and then she'll be staying with my parents in Saint John until I can find an alternate child care solution here. I have mixed feelings about this; I hate that it's a bit of a burden on my parents, even though neither my brother or sister are employed at the moment and my dad is only doing odd jobs for my aunt. At the same time, it's the one place I know won't kick her out so it gives me some much-needed peace of mind. Oh, and it means I can actually have a bit of normal 25-year-old life for a while.

      It's starting to be pretty apparent now that stress is just as much a factor with my gastrointestinal distress as booze. Stress goes up, nausea ensues. I find this to be a problem at bedtime, which is when I do my best fretting and fussing. For some reason, I can only assume it's the lack of food or drink in my belly, I've also been waking nauseous up at 3AM.   To combat this I've pulled a musty, poorly-bound paperback copy of Moby Dick from my bookshelf and started reading myself to sleep by the light of my lava lamp. I've had the novel, and several others, in my possesion since high school. I was lucky to have the opportunity in grade 12 to take on a self-study advanced english class. I feel especially lucky to have the opportunity since my grade 10 and 11 english marks were not so great. Without naming names, I'll just say that the right or wrong teacher can make or break a class. There are teachers with no energy or passion to be in their profession anymore, no urge to actually teach anything, just counting the days to retirement. Those are the teachers we used to make cry. Anyway, back on track here. In my self-guided english class we were required to study two classic novels; one was our own choosing. At the end of the year the pile of novels still sat in a pile on top of a folding table pushed against a cinder-block wall. Being the miscreant that I was, I made off with several of the novels, a few Shakespearean plays, and two books of poetry. To this day I still feel that my action was more of a rescue than a theft.   I am so impressed with the imagery and mastery of words in just the first eight chapters of Moby Dick I felt I had to share my favorites.  "..whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul.." "..and a purse is but a rag unless you have something in it.." "Methinks that in looking at things spiritual, we are too much like oysters observing the sun through the water, and thinking that thick water the thinnest of air."  Oh, and there is a reference to something called pea coffee which has me intriqued. I'll have to look that up.

      When I own my own home, I'm going to have to have at least two washers and dryers. It's not that I have a lot of laundry to do, it's just that I like to be able to do two loads at a time! Two loads of wash in, say, and hour and a half in separate machines. With one set of machines you get a backlog because the drying always seems to take longer than the washing.   I was thinking of going to see the Sunday movie downtown tonight but with Jasmin home that doesn't seem possible. Even with 10 hours of sleep she hasn't been having good days at the daycamp, I hope she has a god day tomorrow, I don't know what I'll do if she gets asked to leave another daycare.   Well I'm off to repair a broken arm on Jasmins' doll!

      Well it looks like tonight I have the choice between "The General's Daughter", or some COPS special. I think I'm going to watch my episodes of Chobits again, thank you Bittorrent!  So I already don't shop at WalMart, now I'm going to stop giving my money to Tim Hortons. My story starts with the fact that I'm broke, and when I say broke I mean I've even spent my overdraft! So with half a tank of gas and NO money in my pocket I take Jasmin to Tim Hortons. I don't drink coffee myself but I have a lot of friends and coworkers that do; during the "roll up the rim" contest they gave Jasmin several winning rims for free cookies and donuts. Jasmin happened to find one of the winning rim pieces today and REALLY wanted a donut. So I take her into town and we go inside, I was sure she was going to pick double-chocolate but instead she decided on the vanilla dip with sprinkles. Smiling, I held up the little torn piece of coffee cup and asked for my free donut.  Cashier: "I'm sorry, we only take those during the contest".  Me: "But there's no expiry date mentioned here" Cashier: "It's written on the contest cups" At which point I had to turn around to my eight-year-old daughter and tell her she wasn't able to get the donut after all and we had to go home now. I can't beleive that, I could understand if I tried to cash in a coupon that was three years old, but not this. I never liked that contest anyway, always thought it probably had worse odds than the lottery.

      Mostly just a nice, quiet day at home. I had to run out this afternoon to the Superstore, OMG I was stuck in the express line for 45 minutes! I've never seen it so busy, I sure hope Phillip appreciates what I do to put food in his dish.   Despite the rain my balcony is dry, Jasmin and I are going to put together a planter tonight.

      Jasmin, D, and I spent five+ hours downtown today, it was a blast. Only my town would feature such talent on Canada day: a comedian who read his skit from a notebook, an elvis impersonator, and  urlLink "Pimp Tea" . We also watched the skit by the  urlLink Calithumpians ; I had no idea they've been around for 25 years!  I ate a three-dollar slice of pizza and washed it down with a dollar-fifty bottle of water, go capitalism! I still liked it better than Halifax last year though, much more family oriented.  Just two hours until we leave for the fireworks!

      I have to confess I'm a CBC radio junkie, and there's an evening show I hadn't yet heard of but will probably try to catch tonight: Sweet Justice.  From the CBC website: "From the team that produced Newsworld’s “The Docket”, Sweet Justice is a weekly radio program probing the legal issues that make you roll your eyes as you read your morning paper, raise your voice in a heated dinner-party debate, or wonder whether Dick the Butcher had a point when he declared it was time to “kill all the lawyers”."  Tonights' show focuses on the democratic right to protest, and how to do so without violating any laws and landing in the slammer (or even worse, pelleted with rubber bullets and eyes doused in pepper-spray).

      I will now tell the tale of the raspberry jam that was never meant to be. It started out as many things do, a fleeting impulse in my brain. I had planned to make strawberry jam this year, but missed out on the best u-pick berries. Shortly after that a friend commented on his appreciation for raspberries and my jam-making scheme was given new life.  Saturday I stopped at an innocent vegetable stand near my parents' cottage and purchased the five pints of berries required in my jam recipe. On Sunday I gathered around me the fruit, sugar, lemons, and Certo ready to commence with the boiling and stirring. Then what to my utter disappointment do I find but mold, MOLD on my berries! Yes, it appears as though they must have been quite taken with the stuff just under the surface when I bought them, for surely blooms like I witnessed there were not formed overnight.  After much wailing and knashing of teeth I determined I was not going to let these rampant spores ruin my jam! I meticulously picked out the berries untouched by any nasty fuzz and rinsed them in some warm water in the sink. I could make this work, I had lots of strawberries still frozen from my u-pick adventure last year; I would just supplement a few cups of one berry for another, genius! Now all I need is that large bowl....    CRASH!  BANG!   SMASH!    tinkle tinkle....    In reaching clumsily for the bowl I knocked it over and managed to also take out one of my onion-soup bowls in a shower of glass and pottery shards. I looked down at the collander in the sink, the berries now covered in the tiniest slivers of glass you've ever seen, and I swore like a sailor. I cleaned everything up and carefully packaged all the glass, and berries, in a cardboard box so as not to impale any unsuspecting sanitation workers.  And just to give you insight into my phsyche; I am more determined than ever to make raspberry jam now.

      It is with great apprehension I will be leaving Jasmin at day camp tomorrow. She's been really good this weekend, there are lots of activities planned to keep her occupied, and I've already spoken with one of the camp supervisors to explain her unique personality so hopefully everything will go smoothly.  I can't wait to surprise her with a new Spongebob Squarepants lunchbox tomorrow, and I've promised to take her to the new Pricess Diaries 2 movie on Saturday if she's been good all week. It's just nerve-wracking knowing that she'll be 30 minutes away if anything goes wrong, and there's no real backup child care setup if I need it.  I've offered to keep my sister here for the two weeks following this week to babysit because the day camp is not available then. She'll get room and board, be away from my parents for a bit, and make $150; I think that's a good deal for a 14-year-old. She seems somewhat unsure about the offer. I guess I can understand that she wants to be around her friends in the summer, but with society today shouldn't material wants way overshadow that?

      1) What animal best represents you?    Probably the cat; fickle, egotistic, and demanding. 2) What color best represents you?    Blue, it's calm and cool and mixes well with just about anything. 3) What season best represents you?    Autumn I think, even though summer is my favorite season. Autumn is more solemn and focused, where summer is more laid back.  4) What emotion best represents you?    Contentment. 5) What flower/tree/plant best represents you?     Not sure but it would thrive best in warm sunny climates, would probably be just plain foliage with no flashy overwhelming flowers, and have a mild but pleasant scent.

      I don't know if it's just natural for me or if I may have a chemical imbalance, but I just don't function well without nine hours of sleep a night; during the winter bump that up to at least ten. Last night I went to see 'King Arthur' and didn't get home until around midnight, and six AM came way too soon this morning. I don't do the caffeine thing either so I spent most of the day in zombie-like stupor.  I did not, however, let my fatique stop me from attending the t-shirt printing workshop at the  urlLink Beaverbrook art gallery . I made a shirt for Jasmin with purple little paw prints leading up to a purple cat with black stripes. I'm quite pleased with how it turned out. There was also a theatrical performance upstairs but I lost track of time with my project and missed it. I also caught a few minutes of TAXI at officers' square before heading home.  I think I might try to scam some babysitting the day I move into the new house and attend the 'Dali Gala' at the art gallery that evening. Food, booze, and art sound like a good way to defrag from a move; and I need more opportunities to wear my sexy black cocktail dress and heels.

      For those uninitiated in the art of packing; the liquor store has the best boxes. They're small so they're great for books and dishes that can make a box very heavy. Sometimes they have handles too, and there are usually LOTS of boxes to be had. Around Fredericton and Oromocto the liquor stores get thier deliveries around noon on Wednesdays, so boxes are usually readily available just after work. I've always found the liquor store workers more than happy to help you load the empty boxes in your vehicle too.  Oh and it's also really fun to haul box after box into your house, each with a different alcoholic beverage advertised on the front, and wonder what the neighbors are thinking.

My 15-pound tabbycat is also deathly afraid of thunderstorms, so I want to know if I'll be spending half the night getting him to stop shaking.
