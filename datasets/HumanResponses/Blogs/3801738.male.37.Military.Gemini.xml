      I have found,  and for selfish reasons,  that the reporting of the war in Iraq misses some of the most important stories and reports non-events.  In Baghdad any event goes over as the start of the Iraqi Tet Offensive.  Some of the most useless reporting comes from the reporting of so-called controlled explosions.  A controlled explosion is where a piece of unexploded ordinance,  an enemy mortar or rocket,  is blown under supervision of EOD.  These happen in every city and town where Coalition forces are stationed.  Here in Mosul we have the Mad Mortarman.  About once a week he moves around the city dropping round within 200 meters of the base,  rarely do they cause damage.  Watching the news you would think that not only does the war only happen in Baghdad but the rest of the country sits by the pool drinking pomegranate juice.  Also it is not as bad as the media makes out but it's still war.  No soldier will ever admit to that because he wants to tell the "I'm a hero"  stories when he gets home.  The Northern region of the country has its fighting but Fallujah and Baghdad are the darlings.  By doing this selective reporting they 1. keep reporters in an easy location and 2. make you think it's much worse than it actually is.  The war reporting as it is now shorts all the Servicemen in this theater who are not in the two darling cities.  Another problem is the impression of total breakdown of relations with the Iraqi people.  In the months I have been here I have had only a few incidents where someone has said a cross word to me and most of them were children not aware of the meaning.  Talk to the majority of Iraqis and they will tell you they are glad the war eliminated the Ba'ath party and Saddams 23 million man slave ring.  This is a country added to the list of nations that the people in many years will say, "I remember when the Americans came to liberate us".  Aside from the reasons we came in, WMD's,  the UN,  Bush's revenge for Dad,  all Joe (slang for any soldier) knows is that he was part of a liberation of a people and the removal of a despot,  and that is the kind of war ALL soldiers want to be a part of.  The American people have been spoonfed the news of this war in a way that makes the Left think it's a disaster,  the Right proclaim victory,  and the soldiers wondering what the fuck is happening everywhere but in their corner.  The facts are that most Iraqis love us,  some hate us,  Iraq is far from over,  and in the end historians will judge the right and wrong of this war.  All I know is the people are free and Saddam is going to hang for his crimes.  Remember,  up until the war started the entire world hated Saddam until it was time to get bloody.    WMD's were a fact to ALL politicians until we didn't find them.  The Al-Qaida connection has been found for those of you who didn't hear we have captured many operatives here,  I have been there.  Screw politics and the nay-sayers on both sides these people are free and it's up to them to want to keep it.

      I have found, in the few years I have been on this rock,  that the biggest problem with all people on this planet is emotion.  Emotion for the things they love and no give to the truth or fact.  Everyone has suffered from this.  We only read what we believe,  we watch the network that makes us feel justified in our belief,  and we will not believe the facts even when they fall out of the sky and crack our thick skulls.  The search for truth is relative.  The search for fact can only lead to edification whether we believe it or not (to thine own self be true).  I have had MANY of my belief bubbles burst and others strengthened.  In the end my emotions were ravaged and my belief system rearranged.  The news of the War in Iraq is going to be a subject as well since I think my perspective is a slight bit more enlightened than the 3 letter outlets. If the personal search for the facts and the dilitantes study of the world interests you come by.    Combat Doc

      Does everyone have the right to go to university, yes. SHOULD everyone go to university, resounding NO. University should be reserved for those who have shown that they have the dedication to work for their education. Students all over the country work for an honor roll only to have that achievement trumped by a simple entrance exam that lets any dolt waste their money. I have heard some people say they cant take tests, then they should try harder or do something else. Education has been cheapened by feeling everyone has to go to college.  THE EGALITARIAN MONSTER REARS ITS HEAD.  I can hear the outrage from here. How many times have people taken grants, loans, and aid for school later to drop out half way through. So many students have missed out on an education because everyone feels they need to go to college later to find they can't do it and drop out. This all-inclusive education has lowered the standards for some schools. Entrance exams use to mean you passed you're in, fail you're out. Now it's to see what level of remedial math to put you in.  The ones who drop out have wasted so much time and money that a trade school later is seen as more school and they fall to the way-side. Any education is worthy even a trade school that will better your present job and forward your career. Every job is needed and the man who repairs your car is as worthy a member of society as the lawyer ( maybe more so ). I have little college and what I have has been for my own entertainment and edification or for military promotion points. But as a medic in the Army I have no need for anything other than specialized classes pertaining to my job.  Lets all find our place and most will discover that we can do more or better once we have a clear vision of what we do best. Not by following the dreams of others.

      America has a love affair with its political parties.  Usually they only vote on one maybe two issues and disagree on the others.  Abortion,  guns,  terrorism,  and foreign policy are some of the hot buttons.  I love my guns but find religious infringement into government policy unconstitutional, who do I vote for.  The Republicans will protect my right to own a firearm but the Democrats will keep the church out of my schools.  Single issue voting is why Americans are pissed off at the system.  Bush Sr. did more to take my guns than Clinton but Clinton had 8 years and dozens of attempts and let Osama Bin-Laden walk.  I hate abortion and corporate welfare,  see where this is going.    I wish I had an answer.  People love their party even when the other guy sounds better.  They just can't bring themselves to vote for him,  just in case he screws up.  This latest crop of Democrats has to be one of the weakest in years.  W. on the other hand is no prize pig.  Todays rant has no solution.  The love of this myth of open democracy has been something that has caused the downfall of the belief in the noble politician.  The citizen politician is dead in favor of the career politician,  or as I refer to them, bottom feeding suction eels.    Unfortunately there is no cure until the American people demand a representative party of the majority.  No one wants a war but if there is one fight hard and finish.  No one wants poverty but instead of supporting it back education and apprentice programs.  Throwing money at a problem no more fixes it than ignoring it.  Something both parties have done.  Just to make myself clear this is not an endorsement of any party.    All I, well WE,  can hope for is that America wakes up and ACTUALLY votes their conscience instead of sticking to the same old rhetoric.  One day when you're alone sit down and say your beliefs out loud.  Debate yourself and you may be surprized at how silly they really are.

      One of the strangest developments of the last 100 years has been the shift of the Black community to the party that fought hardest to keep slaves and segregation.  The politically correct left has managed to maintain a system of racial separation in America and get the love and support of the people it's subjegating. I have said many times on this blog that my problems with this society has NEVER been racial but cultural.  There have been savage White cultures as there have been civilized Black cultures through history.  The left has created a victim mentality and a culture of dependant poverty in America's Black communities.  From Johnson's War on Poverty that created a culture of dependance to Affirmative Action,  Blacks today have it as bad,   though in a different sense, as 50 years ago.  The myth of Affirmative Action takes people down a step because even those who make it on their own merits have the stigma of the program over them.  It is noble to think that people will look past all that but the world is as cynical as we all think.   When Bill Clinton stands in front of a Black church and says,"Most white people wouldn't feel as comfortable here as I do," what do you think that does.  What has the left REALLY done for minorities ( remember I am Cuban ).  Al Gore Sr. tried to block the Civil Rights Act while his Son tries to tout his Dad's achievments in the program.  Robert Byrd was a Klansman.  Most of the most famous racists are Dem's.  Even Strom Thurmond was a Dem' when he was a segregationist,  later changed and became a Republican.  The Black community has always been very religious and family oriented yet the Democrats are a party that supports gay marriage,  and tends to follow the antithesis of religious values.  (remember atheist writer)  The philsophy of equality has been a Conservative issue.  ALL PEOPLE ARE EQUAL.  No special rights for anyone.  No Hate Crime Bill,  what is more hateful than murder,  no affirmative action,  how can we be equal when some finish the race short yet get full credit,  and no seperate cultures.  We are Americans,  not two Americas as the left loves to say.  When the country realizes we are one people we will eliminate the problems and the programs that keep us seperate.  For the record this new Republican Party is no prize pig either.  The equal starting line is what America is not an equal finish line.  That goes for you angry White men too,  sometimes it's just because he's better than you and not because he's Black.

      History has always shown the greatness of the individual.  Modern popular culture has taken the individual to a level that reaches mythical proportions by not singling out great individuals but all.  Throughout man's history names of great men have graced the textbooks of various movements that claim them as thier own.  The issue come in where the value of the individual is given to those who have given little to the actual forwarding or propogating of a movement.  Every person should have the right to express his own political, cultural, or religious values.  Problems come in when great minds are supressed as being elitist when their idea is shown as superior to the common mans.  Why become educated to try to help yourself and those around you if your idea that, may change the world, is thought of as no better than the average man's.  Leaders, in most cases, are leaders because they exhibit a trait that the majority don't have.  Yet in today's society the phrase, "He puts his pants on the same way you and I do," has found it's way into the lexicon.  We don't want someone better than us,  or is it that we don't want to admit that someone is better at something than us.  We all have a distinguishing trait that makes us unique.  Everyone has something that, if nurtured, can benefit themselves and others.  There is something I have said to people for years, "Just because you dig the ditch doesn't mean you can design the shovel."  Everyone has their place, and I have found that the embarrasment of that place or lack of will to change places causes jealousy and a need to feel equal to those who, obviously, have a gift.  One of the worst things I heard when President Clinton was elected was, "He's just like one of us."  I don't want one of us in charge I want someone to look up to.  Someone who has a more informed plan or idea.  I expect more than the average Joe to take charge.  The provincial nature and rise of primitivism the nation has taken on, in the long run, will damage us by not teaching others to strive for the better.  Revolutions in politics, science, the arts, and music are made by individuals.  Groups follow and refine but the committe mentality hinders growth instead of promoting it.  The individual with a singular vision is what generates change.  We need to return to the fostering of great individuals and remove the stigma of intelligence from America.               *Mankind does nothing save through initiatives on the part of inventors, great or small, and imitation by the rest of us.  Individuals show the way and set the patterns.  The rivalry of the patterns is the history of the world.*         William James  1908

      The 2000 elections were to some proof of the merit of the electoral college in that it kept the few states rich in cash and population from dictating policy to smaller states.  Or it was a scam perpetrated by evil Republicans who stole the White House.  Either way it's over deal with it.  I have some simple solutions that could remedy this problem but the power in Washington, left or right, will never let the wonderful loopholes they have slip away.  1. Election day is a paid national holiday to ensure everyone has no excuse.  2. The polls will open at 10 A.M. Eastern and 7 A.M. Mountain and stay open for 24 hours.  3. There will be no exit polls, no early results, and no reports given until 100% of the votes are counted.  4. Same day run off to ensure a majority vote.  The first is obvious as to why it will work.  Number two gives equal time to all states without the possibility of Western votes being swayed by early Eastern results. Point three deals with a similar problem in that exit polls cause people to not "waste" their vote by voting for the "obvious" loser.  Also it will bring people out by not assuming their guy already won. The same day run off is exactly for what has happened in the last three elections.  In '92, '96, and 2000 the third party spoiler, as he is often called, has caused the problems and controversy we've all become use to.  To resolve this you would have your first choice vote,  then you would be asked, "If your first choice doesn't win who would you choose."  This would automatically knock out the third party candidate if he has the minority and the winner would do so by majority.  This would kill the 40% wins we are so accustomed to of late.  The winner of any election that does not have a majority can not claim he has a mandate.  He will be unpopular from day one.  Mull these over and think about the last elections. America needs elections that give the people confidence, not contempt, in their process.

      First things first, I believe in nothing so this is not rant to justify my beliefs. Trendy religions come and go.  The religions of the Earth like Gaia worshipers have waned except for the die hard followers still walking around in bare feet and living in huts in the New Mexico desert.  The '60s and '70s gave us those defects.  They still give the Earth an anthropmorphized existence as if it was a giant organism with us living on it like a tick or leech. The '80s gave us the Death Metal satanism dabblers. In the mid to late '80s it was New Age and unfortunately we still have Yanni and John Tesh who left Entertainment Tonight to pursue a career in bad music.  Now, thanks to Buffy, Angel, and Charmed, its WICCA or Neo-Wicca depending on what genetic defective you talk to.  Just like any other religion every Wicca thinks their coven, or whatever the hell they call it, is the TRUE Wicca.  The only thing that makes this funny is that all the hippies that were following Guru's and Yogi's in the '60s are now becoming Christians again.  I guess they don't want their kids having the same fun and debauchery they had, and they realized Mom and Dad weren't that bad afterall.  Kabbala or Cabbala, depending on what Hollywood rag you read, is the latest wallet-vacuum to come up.  Madonna and Demi Moore have touted its supremacy.  Then again Madonna suppoted GEN. Clark so.  Tom Cruise and John Travolta, two other intellectual powerhouses,  live and die by Scientology.  What does all this say about our society,  are we missing something,  devoid of spirituality,  hearing the call of god and just not getting it.  The biggest problem is the self-centered ME mentality.  I am special,  I can live forever,  God loves ME, I am right.  How about I love mankind.  Why don't these multi-millionares take that money they waste on crystals and clay tables (and the offering plate) and use it to help scientific research to cure cancer or AIDS.  Maybe to buy your child better books or tutilage to give them a better shot at making the world better.  Oooh wait,  wait maybe you can donate it to a charitable group to help those you haven't thought of.  No.  We want to go to heaven,  you hear that WE, me, I.  Religion is nothing but an egotistical attempt to better our status in the eyes of whatever invisible man we believe in.  Notice what religion promise; riches to the poor,  serenity to the stressed,  knowledge to the ignorant.  As I have said before,  we mock ALL religons but our own.  Turn that rapier wit your Minister,  Preacher,  Priest,  or High-Priest taught you and look back at your beliefs.  Hurts don't it.  Don't get mad, we've all been conned at one point in our lives.  Nothing hurts more than the truth,  even if you're not willing to accept it.  Like when Homer was working on a flat tax proposal and accidentally discovered there's no god.  When he gave it to Flanders and he double-checked the work it was air tight.....so he burned it to not let it get out.  Now go out and help your family, children, and world before all the religions that are said to make men unite each other destroy us all.

      This is really going to get a lot of you sugared-up but just read through it all.  The concept of equal viability is an idea of the post-modern philosophers and liberal politicians of the late 20th Century.  The idea that all people, cultures, religions, ideas, and concepts are equal and just misunderstood is probably the ONE thing destroying the fabric of the civilized societies of this world.  To think that we are all equal and have equally viable opinions can be taken to the extreme.  Case in point, Adolf Hitler, there I win.  But you can't use such a drastic example.  The modern phenomenon of being non-judgemental,  ie "I'm OK, You're OK,"  is part of the problem.  The moral cowards of this world don't want to be found out or hated the way they were brought up by their parents so decided to change it.  Having an intolerance,  yes even hatred for those morals considered universally wrong keeps the balance.  MORALITY IS NOT ABOUT THE BEDROOM! Now that thats out of the way.  Cultural diversity is not the wonderful egalitarian thing it's made out to be.  The subjegation of women,  sweatshops,  Theocracies,  genital mutilation,  superstition,  honor killings,  claiming Machismo for criminal defense all fall under this subject.  The Western ideal has made the world what it is.  Alright liberals say it, "Yes, look at the world."  OK lets,  every year the average life span goes up.  We have 90% fewer farms and 400% more food.  Freedom of religion, ANY religion is a rare thing in these cultures yet common to us.  The Germ Theory has saved the lives of countless millions.  Theocarcies have all but been eliminatd along with slavery, child labor, and divine monarchs. All the nations who have civilized themselves in the last 150 years have done so using the Western Ideal and tailored it to whatever ethnic slant their country has.  What are the problem cultures,  Militant Islam, Asian Communists, Central-American Despots. Some claim a democracy but underneath hide their true nature.  Understand something, this is NOT a racial argument but a cultural one.  Europe had its share of savage cultures as well.  Some problems have not been resolved until recently. In the West we have our problems but our culture has a history of calling out and addressing the problem.  The message, though once selectivly applied, has been extended to all.  The uncivilized don't even have the message much less the desire to apply it.  I have found that in my study of history as long as the conquering culture is less savage than those conqured they survive long enough to make permanent change at a cultural level. Europeans are not the master race by any stretch of the imagination,  but the ideal that brought the continent out of the dark ages, the plague, and smallpox is what has changed the world for the better.  All you guilty white liberals I spoke about before if you feel so bad about what your ancestors did sell everything and give it to the first Indian you see or buy a Black man a ticket to Africa then go back to Europe,  no.  Then lets all get over it and live together to try to make a better world. We have the potential to make the most productive and powerful world man has known. The freedoms we have taken for granted in the West are now under assault and if we are not careful of the tolerant-to-the-point-of-tolerating-intolerance philosophy it will hand over 500 years of progress to savages.

      The conviction to win a war has never run along party lines but has been a matter of conviction on the part of those who initiated the conflict.  Every major conflict of the last 54 years has had some politico pulling strings from the rear that affect the lives of those on the ground.  Clear agenda based on total victory is the sure way to keep soldiers alive in battle.  When a martial artist is trying to break a board with his hand,  he aims through the board focusing his energy behind it.  If he has his focal point on the board the slightest flinch can cause injury.  The same concept applies to the battlefield. A half-hearted approach or a plan that does not have total destruction of the enemy in mind will cause unnecessary deaths on all sides.    We had an incident in a mosque where it was being used as an observation and listening post by the enemy.  This automtically negates its protected status.  Our hesitation to enter the mosque was based on some misinterpretation of the Geneva Convention.  By waiting for the Iraqi National Guard to come and clear the mosque several insurgents escaped out the back as seen by the residents of the neighborhood.  Now those men are running free and may kill more.  For those of you not in the know,  the mosques harbor terrorists in some parts of the city so they are no longer non-combatants.  If we had gone in with a plan to level the mosque and eliminate the threat or enter and clear the mosque a message would have been sent and those who escaped would not be a threat to innocent civilians again.  As in Korea,  Vietnam,  Somalia,  and Desert Storm the inability of a soldier to secure a mission not dictated by politics or the fear of hurting someones feelers will cause more deaths than lives saved.  If you want me to do my job,  don't ask me how I do my job.

      Bear with the title and these first few lines.  A few years ago I had a discussion with a few mathmatician friends about time travel and entropy,  entropy being disorder in a system.  When you go back in time (theoretical) your presence would change things thereby it would change the world you return to.  My point was that it would only change the world as you know it.  Those in this new entropic universe would see it as normal so any attempt to change it would destroy their world.  Leading to this, our beliefs are no safer from this entropy than thermodynamic theory is.  Most people find the belief that fits them best and not by an analysis of facts or what is best for all.  Political beliefs, as religion, come from family or culture and not so much from your true beliefs.  Searching for facts are painful.  The last thing you want is to find out your deepest beliefs are based on lies or misinformation.  Nixon suporters had to have been crushed to the point of denial that some hold to this day or justify as "They all do it."  Clinton supporters ran in droves when the scandels reared themselves.  Now President Bush has his own demons to slay.  The subject of religion is always taboo but how can you laugh at the Greeks,  Indians,  and Egyptians when you believe the emaculate conception.  How about the 6 day creation or the Sun stopping in the sky to prolong a battle.  If you are a believer,  sorry.  The beliefs we hold are who we are and NO ONE can can change your mind.  But every once in a while we have to ask questions.  I have to say that the reasons we were sent to Iraq are in question and if subterfuge WAS involved we need to know.  This habit of making accusations or having beliefs that have not been tried with the inquisitive mind are one of the most damaging things plaguing man.  Again no one wants to learn that their whole intellectual life (used very loosly) has been for naught.  Whether it's politics,  superstition,  racism,  sexism,  books,  cars,  or diet soda find out if the truth behind your belief jives with the facts.

      The country is rich in history so it gives you a respect for what you see,  and a sadness.  It's in ruin from years of neglect.  It's filthy and the smell of human waste is everywhere.  Usually you hear gunfire and explosions about 5-10 times a day.  The feeling of not coming home never enters your mind,  but is always there.  The people are nice and friendly but untrustworthy at the same time.  Every Kurd you run into introduces himself as such and thanks you for ridding them of Saddam.  You quickly learn to hate the American media.  Luckily the children have no idea how poor they really are.  Dead bodies are not as wierd as they once were.  You get Smokes are $.50 a pack.  Yes they drink,  smoke,  and have dozens of porn theaters here.  All the children wave and smile,  some ask for money.  The spirit-crushing 120 degree heat is everywhere even in air-conditioned rooms.  Sometimes you feel like you're baking in your clothes.  You wear about 70 lbs of gear in this heat and a weapon.  The first time you lock-and-load your weapon and don't get nervous you get scared,  you have just become complacent.  When your vehicle gets hit by an RPG you have to take a second to realize what happened.  Explosions are louder and sound different than in the movies.  No matter how far away it is it sounds like it's on top of you,  and when it's on top of you you're first impression is shock that you are ok.  You'd be surprised what you can sleep through.  You'd be surprised what you find funny now and what really pisses you off.  You now know how trivial every complaint you ever had is.  You know how much you really like or dislike certain people,  and how much you love others.  Mostly you find out what your made of and many are made of shit.  You love America but have contempt for those still there partying and acting like assholes.  Shooting at a man is not as hard or traumatic as people make it out to be in movies but you have to train yourself to want to go home alive.  You hate your enemy,  he is a killer of his own people and has no remorse because "God" told him to do it.  You fill your heart with hate so you can kill him and come home to your family,  and hope his death will save a family here.    Now you self-righteous civilians who are giving the "I know" and the "You see" or the "What did you expect" speech right now shut up.  You don't fucking know and until you man-up and come over here you never will.  Mostly you look at it as a really cool job that every guy who sees a movie thinks he can do but doesn't.  You are now a part of history,  you want to go home but are proud you were here.  "Thirty years from now when you're by your fireside with your grandson on your knee and he says, 'Grampa what did you do in the great World War II' you wont have to say, 'Well,  I shoveled shit in Louisiana.'"

      No matter who you are or what age ask yourself this;  "Who's generation is most significant."  Everyone answered mine.  "The music back then was the best",  "Cars were the best",  "Politicians were honest",  and in my case "The military was harder when I went through Basic."  This brings me to Soldier of Fortune (Fiction) magazine,  a bunch of old ' Nam freaks who think we all need to use their equipment,  their tactics,  and have the heart they had to win this thing.  Without getting to technical the Army's new Stryker vehicle is state-of-the-art,  we all hated it until we got to Iraq.  I have been hit by RPG's,  small-arms,  and 2 155mm shells buried in the road and the paint wasn't chipped.  Our new M-16 variant,   the M-4,  is far superior to anything I have used in the field.  Remember I first went through basic in 1986 then again in 2002 so I see the difference.  This unit does nothing but urban warfare something that didn't exist when I went through infantry school.  All the weapons have tac-lights for clearing rooms,  IR lasers to use at night and holo-sights to sight in easier.    But if you read SoF they want us all to carry M-14's (an old rifle used in Vietnam that weighs about 14 lbs unloaded),  and go back to a 40 year old APC for rolling around the city.    "My generation is relevant."  It echoes every time I read that rag.  No matter who you are you feel you music is best,  your movie is best,  your car,  your TV show.  Why.  We have an emotional attachment to these things.  First kiss,  first car,  first R-rated movie,  whatever.  New is not bad as change,  when needed,  is not bad.  Change for the sake of change is dangerous,  but new ideas and concepts are what drives this world to strive for the better things.  That rag would enrage me when I would read it.  I have done missions with SEALs,  Delta,  and SF and they loved working with us more than any other unit because they say we actually know what we're doing.  Then the generational relevance argument would hit me and calm me down.  Their demographic is 'Nam freaks so appeal to them.  Next time you hear that old fart talk about his day and his music,  remember you will, or already do, the same thing.  Why don't you all f-f-f-fade away.

      One of the funniest things about the insurgents here is just how ineffective they really are.  Americans are dying, yes, but at what rate compared to the states and to what end.  Those of you who have read Che Guevarra's Guerilla Warfare will say they are doing it by the book but here the Iraqis are more pissed at the insurgents than the U.S.  Since the big attack on 24 June we have heard near nothing from the resistance fighters.  Considering the 5 hour firefight we gave them and the bags they went home in I can understand.  But what are they fighting,  an occupation or the big boy on the block.  Most countries that hate the U.S. hate our position in the world.  Now the politics of the war aside the country is free have found that the general population of this country is happy about it.  The Ba'ath party is gone and are playing it smart by cooperating.  If there's one thing the rich and privileged know how to do is stay rich and privileged.  What we are fighting now are Shiite militants who want a new Iran,  and opportunists.  When we find a weapons cache in a house it's not monumental.  A few rifles,  ammo,  a grenade or two,  maybe an RPG.  All this leads me to our country and the myth of the anti-war movement.  What is your typical anti-war protester;  white,  rich,  in college,  and young.  What are they protesting,  the death of soldiers,  no.  How about innocent civilians,  no,  the terrorists killed 1,000 times more than we ever will.  The environmental impact,  no this country was a cesspool when we got here.  I guess the fact that now there is no draft just kills the main focus of the '60s argument.  So what is it,  a need to belong to something.  Here in Iraq the majority of the insurgents are Shiites who were the disenfranchised group amongst the populace,  now they have their chance to make a name for themselves.  In America the campuses of the major universities are a haven for sheltered,  innocent minds who have never had a part in anything significant in their lives.  With dessicated professors who brag about all the protests they claim to have been a part of in the '60s egging them on in social activism how else is an impressionable mind to react.  The radicals are exhibitionists,  craving attention and living in a fully-paid dorm room richer than an Iraqi family's whole house.    As a child the world is black and white because you know no better.  As you grow older it finds a grey area.  Them you reach a point in you're late 20s to early 30s that you realize it IS black and white,  why.  As a child you are guided by your parents and family who give you that delineated morality you all hated so much as a teenager.  When you strike out on your own you become exposed to things and places that never would have come into your provincial life.  Once the novelty wears off though you find that the black and white is not as simplistic or the grey not as complex as you once thought.    Here it is black and white.  We are the good guys,  terrorists and insurgents are the bad guys.  They kill civilians,  their own people,  their police,  their army,  and destroy their homes.  They hate the big boy,  they have a voice now (given by the big boy),  and they want to say "I was there."  So remember when you're in your speech class and that one guy you hate stands and gives his opinion,  before you call him a Nazi or a Communist ask yourself what you hate; him,  the ideas,  or your own insignificant status in the world.

      One of the saddest things in this country (Iraq) is that the people have NO clue what freedom of anything is.  Yes they are proud and are slowly learning not to behave so subserviently,  but the last 300 or so years have been under a tyrant or colonial rule.  This hits close to home for me because my family escaped Cuba and ran at all speed to the U.S. starting in 1959 The last of my family came in 1981.  So helping these people begin their lives and nation anew is very exciting and depressing.  Depressing because I see Americans not aware of their fortune in this world.  The poorest person in America has food,  a home,  electricity,  most have cars.  Here they live in 1,000 year old husks of buildings,  have raw sewage running in the street,  barefoot(not by choice) 2 year old children,  and a class of terrorist that kills 100 civilians to soldiers killed.  So what is my complaint,  you are to comfortable.  You complain about the drive-thru,  the cable TV reception,  can't find your damn $150 sneakers in blue,  and voting.  Dozens of countries around the world have had revolutions to do the same thing you complain about doing once a year.  I can bet most of you would not die for the right to vote.  But you bitch all day about Bush,  Clinton,  Nixon (most of you don't know what he did),  the economy,  the environment (come see how others treat their nations resources),  and the war.  I haven't seen many of you here.  An uninformed choice is no choice.  How can you talk about a place or an experience that you have never experienced.  I had a t-shirt when I was in Korea that said "Korea,  if you ain't been there SHUT THE FUCK UP."  Everyone will tell you how bad Korea is and have never been there.  Before you start to complain or talk about something get all sides.  I swear to god when I get home the first person I hear complain about not having enough ice in their Coke is getting laid out.  You people better start looking at he rest of the world and seeing how lucky you all are or you will wind up like this place.  Do we as Americans have the right to complain,  of course,  that's part of our revolution.  But seeing a dead child from a terrorists car bomb will make you reassess how much ice you really need in that drink.

      What am I worried about,  American moviegoers getting their news from the big screen demagogue that is Michael Moore.  I have no love for President Bush,  he is the kind of big money Republican that gives Republicans a bad name,  BUT.  Anyone that allows their brains to be pumped full of the unsubstantiated nonsense that M.M. pumps out deserves the fucked up country he's telling them they have.  FACTS,  too much to ask.  All of the film is hearsay,  "What I think", and coincidence.  The worst part of it is that the accusations are not backed up with evidence to support his story.  A lot of "What do you think of..."  If these things are true then we need to know the truth.  Right now though I don't hear of 60 Minutes or 20/20 doing a story on the facts of M.M.'s film.    The worst part is how he portrays "The sovereign Nation of Iraq"  (his words)  as the ideal of fun and freedom with images of children playing and flying kites with happy women running around Baghdad then...SHOCK AND AWE!!!!  He fills the screen with images of dead children and civilians.  All the footage of soldiers in Iraq shows us as boorish rock and roll assholes who want to burn Iraq to the ground.  We all commit war crimes and taunt prisoners,  according to the film.  "An immoral war leads to immoral behavior"  paraphrase from the film,  so we are immoral hmm.  Every shot is of a overpowering American soldier violating the civil rights of some poor Iraqi civilian who just wanted to live in the loving shadow of Saddam Hussein.    I don't know what part of Iraq M.M. was in but almost every Iraqi I have spoken to is UNBELIEVABLY happy we came and deposed Saddam.  The same argument about the peace-loving people of Vietnam was used to cover all of them not just the true peace-loving people.  Michael Moore shamelessly uses the mother of a dead soldier to hang herself on a cross (figuratively) in this film.  You lost you son,  sorry.  He was a grown-ass man who made the decision to join (at her urging) and serve his country.  When you join the military you lose all bitching rights.  I have been doing this on and off since 1986 and guess what like the man said "This is the life we have chosen."  The display of this woman's emotion is heart-wrenching unless you're a complete bastard but that was his choice.    All the Joe's here are really pissed at this depiction in the film and want to say something to someone.  M.M. needs to temper his anger with a little restraint.  It's clear he hates the military.  You can't support the troops and hate what we do at the same time.  That negates my existence.  Iraq is free and they love us for it.  I know you will hate this line but I am not Hitler;  The end justifies the means,  Iraq is free and they are happy.  Come here and see.

      Being in Iraq I missed the Penn & Teller show on Showtime,  Bullshit.  A friend let me borrow it on DVD and I haven't stopped watching it for two days.  Anyone interested in skeptical inquiry needs to find this.  Everything from psychics speaking to the dead,  feng shui,  second-hand smoke,  alternative medicine,  creation science,  UFO abductions and bottled water are all raped by the skeptical minds of Penn Jillette and Teller with the help of The Amazing Randi.    Now begins the rant.  The pseudo-science and claims of the paranormal are something that's been around since man invented currency to give these hucksters.  The title of this blog is taken from the book by Carl Sagan The Demon Haunted World;  Science as a Candle in the Dark because the title describes what this country and Mankind need.  Why do people insist on following the nonsense of UFO's when there has been no evidence to show there existence.  Why do people still insist on taking St. John's Wart when modern medicine has a proven aid for depression.  Moving your furniture will not make you rich,  The Bible only has hidden clues to things that have ALREADY happened,  same with Nostradamus' predictions.  So why do we believe these things,  are we stupid (luckily not most of us).  No,  we desperately want to talk to our dead parent,  we want to believe that aliens have the answers to all the ails of our time (and notice that alien prophecy is always answering the problems of the time, usually involving trendy moral arguments).  Isn't it more impressive to know that we,  humans built the pyramids using our minds.  That we are intelligent enough to do things our damn selves and are not children needing constant tutelage.  Yes,  Yes I can hear them now, "We are an infant race and we need guidance to not destroy ourselves."  Nothing is worse than stupid people trying to sound intelligent.    There is a book out called A Pale White Horse about EVERY conspiracy you can think of.  Read this book,  I can't remember the last time I had such a good laugh.  UFO's,  the assassination of Kennedy,  the Trilateral commission (by the way it's www.trilateral.org),  the Freemasons,  the New World Order, and the CIA's contract with Satan.  HOLY SHIT!  It is so easy to say that some outside entity is messing your world up.  No one ever says I lost my job because I'm an idiot,  America is fucked up because uneducated Americans reading the Weekly World News instead of a book, no.  The Jewish Banking conspiracy took my job,  Masons control the world (as a Mason I can tell you that, at least I, control shit).  The skeptical mind can save you from all manner of con-artists,  yes even in church.  I'm not telling you not to believe in god,  just don't follow every scumbag who claims to get phone calls from him.  When man begins to realize that only we control our destiny and not the boogy man in his ivory tower or spaceship we can start to grow out of this infant superstitious race.  There I agree with the aliens.

      I am going to write some names,  I want you to tell me the first word that comes into your head; France,  Germany,  Russia,  U.N.  If you're reading this site then you thought of the same things I did.  Countries are claiming that the U.S. is now a colonial power or is practicing imperial policy have been the worst colonial powers in the last 500 years.  You all need to go back to your Third grade history books and read about the last 50 years.  Vietnam,  Algeria (France), All of Europe and North Africa (Nazi Germany),  List to long to mention (Soviet Russia).  The term Guilty White Liberal goes to all you people who suddenly feel guilty about what you found out your parents and grand-parents did.  Does not the change of the present help make up for the wrongs of the past.  Not to Europe who,  apparently,  wants everyone to forget how we in America left their monarchy's and aristocracies to be free.  Why now do the biggest perpetrators of human rights abuses of the last 50 to 100 years cry foul on us.  France as recently as 40 years ago was still trying to keep Algeria under its yoke.  Now they cry about the American response to 9/11 and subsequent operations.  From the country that banned Muslim head dresses in schools.  Germany has some of the strictest citizenship policies in the world,  from wwhat they say, to keep the Turk's Turk's.  Russia is notorious for getting rid of its Jews with a blessing and a kick to the ass.  And the U.N. keeps despots and tyrants in its ranks trumping the freedom loving peoples of the world by having countries like Cuba in the Human Rights Council.  I am Cuban so this really burns my ass.  America is only hated by those who either only know it or have never been there.  This is not ancient history.  You can take the stance of Eleanor Clift of Newsweek and say that Saddam's abuses on the Kurds happened 15 years ago so what's the big deal,  or we can hold those accountable.  (this rant is not about Iraq)  Before you tell me to clean my house,  clean yours.  Within the last 40 years every country in the U.N. that is crying out against anything the U.S. does is the worst on their record of it's own house's care.    Those of you that don't agree with me have probably never had any significant time in a foreign country,  and not as a tourist.  I have been to over a dozen nations in 4 continents and even the most liberal country can't compare to the freedom and opportunity we have in the U.S.  Before you accuse me of working for the Department of Tourism and Indoctrination I admit we have our problems and history as well.  Our country addresses problems and tries to remedy them.  Most other countries throw money at a problem and still have the problem or deny it and push it aside.  State sponsored abuses of the populace is policy even in the most enlightened of nations.  When we want a better for our nation we must concern ourselves with ourselves and not worry about what a speck of land 5,000 miles away thinks.  Especially when that speck has done worse in our lifetimes than we in our whole history.

      There is a certain hierarchy in the Military even though most don't want you to know about it.  Combat arms is at the top,  all combat arms. Infantry,  engineers,  SEAL's,  SF,  armor and generally those who launch bullets for a living are combat arms.  EVERYONE else is a POGue,  People Other than Grunts.  Don't try to be cute and be like cops that changed Pig to Pride,  Integrity,  and Guts and say Personnel Of Garrison you are POGues.  The reason I say this is that I saw the Time magazine cover for Person of the Year on my buddies wall and not only were the three on the cover POGues the one in the front was a woman.  Now before you have an aneurysm listen,  women in the Army is not the issue the issue is that the members of that little group are NOT the ones who are winning the war.  The ones winning this fight are the ground pounders.  Most POGues never leave the wire and when they do they are the targets the insurgents are going after because they are "soft targets".  Meaning that they are not trained as fighters and are most likely going to scramble after being hit.    Now don't get me wrong,  I like having my Stryker fixed,  my chow warm,  and the A/C working and these guys have more stones than the civilian who is protesting only because he's scared to come over regardless of his feigning morality.  BUT wars are won by the rifleman.  In this man's army you are infantry or infantry support.  Even D-boys do their mission in support of our operations (Delta definitely NOT POGues).  I tire of the media saying "You're all heroes,  we love you (slurp slurp)".  Stop pandering we already watch your damn show.  The so-called "soft M.O.S.'s" support us to win the war.  As a medic now I really get the ass when I see doctors,  nurses,  and medics in the CSH (combat support hospital) wearing the Combat Medical Badge when they have never seen the outside of the wire from day one.  This is an award for medics who are on the line with the grunts.  As an ex-grunt I have nothing but the utmost respect for those baptized by fire.  So a frivolous award of something meant to honor those of us who get paid to attract bullets gets me going.  **POLITICO-PHILOSOPHICAL NOTE** This is part of society's egalitarian notion of equality and equal viability.  Not everyone contributes to society at the same level.  That's why there isn't a "Piece-of-Shit-Crack-dealing-Murderer of the Year" award.  If you want the rewards you need to perform to the rewards standards.  You are a soldier,  isn't that enough.  Why must you fight to cheapen the struggle of others so you can get kudos for an award you didn't deserve.  Tankers have been fighting since World War II for a combat tanker badge and still haven't received one because the infantry is in the most danger on the battlefield.  Don't try to justify your existence by lowering my bar to raise yours.  How about just coming up to my level.  If you're not willing then be content with what you have.  It's just like in Real World Revelation 2 everyone wants to do the sexy war-guy stuff but no one wants to get dirty.

      Everyone wants to go play war until the shooting starts.  I know what you're thinking "I don't want to get shot at either",  fine then don't join the military.  Yay volunteer military.  In this country though the volunteers are looking for a paycheck and status.  After years of repression and being nobody's they have the chance to help themselves and their families.  Seeing Americans fight is cool to them.  Sexy gear,  good weapons and tactics and we taught them how to do it and use it, BUT.  Now that they are receiving fire because we are around they don't want us around.  The local military now referred to as the Iraqi National Guard wants to conduct patrols on their own since every time we show up insurgents fire at them.  It's hard enough to get them to go out when we show imagine the vacation they will be on without U.S. troops egging them on.    The message this infant military is sending is that when the shooting starts they hide.  One of the first rules in an ambush is to charge the ambush.  Some always die but at least some will live.  The only exception are the Iraqi troops trained by Special Forces.  They have a confidence and ability none in this country's military can match.  Unfortunately a small percentage of their troops are S.F. trained.  When we had a police station overrun on the 24 Jun the Iraqi Police ran from their post due to,  apparently,  overwhelming numbers.  When the ING arrived to help us they were Professionals to the Nth degree.    In the U.S. and here in Iraq what must be explained to all potential soldiers is that,  now this is a stretch mind you,  YOU MAY GET SHOT AT IN THIS JOB.  The blame is not always on the soldier.  There is an old saying that goes "Let no soldiers soul cry, 'Had I only been trained' ".  The promise of travel,  prestige,  and pay must be tempered with the reality of war.  The world military's are not places of social experimentation or easy employment,  or even college money.  I am going to shock you now but...WE MAKE WAR,  sorry.  The reward for defending your nation is pay and the like but that is our first order of business no matter what the recruiting posters say.  So in America as Iraq the Armed Forces and its recruits must be made to understand that we defend our nations and for doing so we give you pay,  prestige,  and college money.  Just remember that YOU WILL BE SHOT AT.

      One of the strangest things to see is a fractured human body.  If you have ever seen someone with broken bone it evokes this morbid fascination to stare without feelings of guilt.  What else is strange is how different it is from anything Hollywood portrays.  There's not as much blood as you would think,  when you find body parts they look exactly the way they do on the body,  and people never die with their eyes closed.  I went to the sight of a car bombing recently that wounded or killed almost 50 and found a pile of human intestines just sitting in the road in the intersection,  just laying there.  Every car had been painted with the blood of its former occupant.  It doesn't traumatize you but you can't help but stare or sometimes even touch.  The scene was what you think of when you think of war,  real war.  You always wonder if you can handle it psychologically and you're scared you might not perform as you hope.  When the time comes you do,  and that's when you realize that war does not affect everyone the way you hear.  Every movie you ever watch tells you that Vet's are all basket cases from what they've seen.  I have fired and been fired at and found it to be the most exciting thing I have ever experienced.  You don't think about the what-if's, "What if I had been closer or farther", or "Man, that could have been me".  If it wasn't you it wasn't you, drive on.    Watching guys ducking under fire is one of the funniest things you see here.  Believe me,  the wounds I have treated,  no amount of ducking will save you.  As fast as it happens ducking just gets you to the ground quicker.  Man 's inhumanity to man is something we don't think about,  he just tried to kill someone or set off a car bomb that killed no soldiers but 10 children,  some men deserve inhumanity.  No matter what you hear in the media there are scumbags here that don't care how many of their own people they kill as long as 1 American is wounded.  People are so dramatic for the most minor non-event.  They all want the pity lay when they get home and start telling the "What I went through" stories. We all volunteered, I've found that's the main difference between this and all other wars. The only exception might be WW II where most Americans felt a duty to answer the call to conscription. You lose the right to bitch when you say "I'll do it" and smash your hand with hammer.  Sometimes I feel that in 20 years it will all hit me and my wife will find me in a corner singing Mary had a Little Lamb while sucking my thumb.  Right now though the only way to survive is do your job,  get home,  and deal with what comes later.

      The problem with democracy is the voter. Now you're all going to want to whip me in public square for some of this but read on. How can you have a block of voters who don't really understand the process since they haven't been a part of it or contributed to its financing. Having a voting age of 18 has to be one of the most ridiculous things this country has done. How can a student still in high school possibly know the issues that REALLY affect this nation. Most 18 year olds are emotional disasters who jerk towards the first feeling they get without real thought of consequence. Even at 21, unless you have been working or been off to the military, you have no real clue as to the nature of the average man or the working world. What I find funny are the idealist liberal university students who pleads for the working man while driving the car bought by mommy, the professional whatever. These, ready, children have no more right to dictate government policy than the non-producer. Next paragraph.....  Same for the welfare junkie who hasn't worked in over 5 years out of laziness. Now some have legitimate problems, handicap and the like but those who use the system for profit should not vote. Who are these, anyone who is able-bodied, sane, and over 18 can find a job, you may not like the job, but they're out there. That's another rant. I know convicted felons who have more right to vote than those mentioned above. If you don't produce for the society and government how can you very well tell the government what to use the money for. You know why, the politicians that use these sponges and realign their borders to have them for themselves. They then promise not to take it away or promise more...BAM, votes.  Can this be resolved, no. Politicians will never take away what is now seen as a right. Voting is something that I here in Iraq see the people dying for. You lazy Americans (and subjects of the Crown, not a jab at you timx) have fallen into this lie of the universally valid argument. NO the 18 year old high school student does not know the real world. NO the non-producer does not have the right to dictate policy. So how does this get resolved, it doesn't. As long as you believe all people are the same and have the same rights you do taxes will go up to fund the sponges, children will vote their "conscience" and politics will continue as normal. With the people who take more than a glance at the facts screaming with frustration at the Perot and Nader voters, and realizing that to vote for the nation and its future you must have been a part of its past and a donor to the future.

      Morals and religion have always moved hand-in-hand with politics. Today we have so many "moral" questions that society has been split into only fanatical factions with no appeasement. What makes something immoral. If god and religion were not a part of the human world would murder be wrong. How about rape or incest. If religion didn't exist would you stop loving your children and immediately begin raping them. Of course not, only the morally impotent would need religion to guide their lives. All these things are wrong either way. The natural truths of right to exist without molestation (other definition) are the basic guide to morality.  WHAT IS THE FUSS ABOUT.  Gays, drugs, pornography, guns, and other non-moral things. Morality is what is accepted by the society you live in. Again going back to basic truths, none of these things affects the world around them unless used improperly or IMMORALLY. Same-sex couples, though I don't approve of it, have no affect on my existence so my moral standard has no bearing on what they do in private as what I do with my wife in our bedroom has no affect on you. Drugs have been in existence for millennia and only the misuse (alcohol, tobacco don't forget them) is what brings a problem in the society.  Pornography is about the same in my book as the Bible. If you don't like it don't read it. The only difference is that I don't make them teach from the Book of Jenna Jameson in Georgia public schools so keep it out of mine. Religious encroachment would probably be stemmed in public life if others forced their "morals" on the fanatics.  Does a sociey accepting something make it moral...maybe, so long as its not a violation of the individuals rights. The opening list has some of the things that fall under the violation of the individual. Homosexuality, porno, lawful gun ownership, 90 year olds driving are some. Slavery was once "moral"...violation of the individual. Spousal abuse....also a violation.  So what is moral, we may never know for sure. What is sure is that as long as what I do is not a violation to you and I feel it's moral, you have no say.  Oh god I sound like a Libertarian.

      How did this culture of Western thought go from the enlightened science and discovery of the last 200 years to the superstitious and cowardly lot we are today.  Science and politics have become the realm of nay-sayers and wimps unable or unwilling to take the risk or seek adventure.  From the idea of eliminating the old, useless ideas to the fostering of new more dangerous or ill thought out ideas along with ignorance by choice brought us here.  The realm of science and technology have fallen to popular movements like environmentalism and anti-corporate bias.  Nuclear power is dying out when if you look at the history and science common sense will show that coal and oil has killed more than nuclear.  These two have also polluted more than the atom. Black lung, collapsed mines, oil fires amd yes drownings are at least 100 times more than Chernobyl.  Even its residues from use affect us more than nukes.  Cars kill more people in Miami than guns in all the US.  Sanctioned poverty in the form of programs that reward laziness have created 4th and 5th generation urban slaves chained to poverty and ignorance by the government.  Laws banning smoking have isolated 40% of the population who are partaking in a legal activity where you don't have to go if you don't like it.  Western medicine has increased our lifespan two-fold in 200 years yet people still believe those ancestors of ours who died at 40 had better medicine than us.  Germs are real psychics are not.  Space is the future of man Nostrodamus is not.  READ!!  Politicians keep their jobs by telling us they will fix the problems we should fix ourselves, not by using some new law.  Just read and learn the facts and don't depend on some huckster who wants you to extend his contract and $20,000 an hour speaking fee.  Work,  education,  courage are what made the world great.  This new lack of intestinal fortitude and willingness to sacrifice for all our better will bankrupt our society faster than any Enron, Michael Moore, or George Bush combined.  The future is reserved for the brave.

      This was sent to me by a friend who served in Iraq and left 5 months after my unit arrived.  Read this and see if you agree,  and if you don't who cares it's still a good point.  For good or ill the Iraqi prisoner abuse mess will remain an issue-on the one hand right thinking Americans will abhor the stupidity of the actions while on the other hand political glee will take control and fashion this minor event into some modern day My Lai massacre.  I heard some Arabs are asking for an apology.  I humbly offer mine:  -I am sorry that the last seven times the Americans took up arms and sacrificed the blood of our youth it was in defense of Muslims ( Bosnia, Kosovo, Gulf War1 Kuwait, etc) -I am sorry that no such call for an apology upon the extremists came after 9/11.  I am sorry that all of the murderers on 9/11 were Arabs. -I am sorry that Arabs live in squalor under savage dictatorships.  I am sorry that their leaders squandor their wealth.  I am sorry that their government breeds hate for the US in their religious schools. -I am sorry that Yasser Arafat was kicked out of every Arab country and hijacked the Palestinian "cause." I am sorry that no other Arab country will take in  or offer more than a token amount of financial help to those same Palestinians. -I am sorry that the US has to step in and be the biggest financial supporters of poverty stricken Arabs while insanely wealthy Arabs blame the US. -I am so sorry that our own left wing elite and our media can't understand this. -I am sorry that the UN scammed the poor people of Iraq out of the "food-for-oil" money so they could get rich while the common folk suffered. -I am sorry that some Arab governments pay the families of homicide bombers upon their death.  I am sorry that those same bombers are seeking 72 virgins.  I can't seem to find one on Earth. - I am sorry that the homicide bombers think babies are a legitimate target. -I am sorry that our troops died to free more Arabs.  I am sorry they stopped the gang rape rooms and the filling of mass graves of dissidents. -I am sorry they show so much restraint when their brothers-in-arms get killed.  I am sorry that Muslim extremists have killed more Arabs than any other group. -I am sorry that foreign trained terrorists are trying to seize control of Iraq and return it to a terrorist state.  I am sorry we don't drop a few dozen Daisy Cutters on Fallujah. -I am sorry that every time terrorists hide they find a convenient "Holy Site."  I am sorry they didn't apologize for driving a jet into the World Trade Center that collapsed and severly damaged St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church - one of our Holy Sites. -I am sorry they didn't apologize for flight 93 and 175, the USS Cole, the embassy bombings, etc. -I am sorry that Michael Moore is American; he could feed a medium sized village in Africa. -I am sorry the French are ? French.  America will get past this latest absurdity.  We will punish those responsible because thats what we do. We hang out our dirty laundry for all the world to see. We move on. That's why we are hated so much.  We don't hide all this stuff like all the Arab countries that are now demanding an apology.  Deep down inside when most Americans saw this reported in the news we were like...so what.  We lost hundreds and made fun at a few prisoners.  Sure it was wrong, sure it dramatically hurts our cause but until captured we were trying to kill these same prisoners. Now we're supposed to wring our hands because a few were humiliated? Our compassion is tempered with the vivid memories of our own kind being killed, mutilated and burnt amongst a joyous crowd of celebrating Fallujans.  If you are sorry for all this also,  pass it on.

      Basic universal morals have been a part of humanity since the formation of organized governments.  Religion has played a major part in those laws.  The issue today has been if the religion is guiding the law or making the law.    Thomas Jefferson appreciated the value of religious morals so, that he wrote the Jeffersonian Bible where the basic moral precepts of Christianity were kept excluding the religious teaching.  The issue has never been the religion or what it stands for but its encroachment on the daily lives of those not of that religion.  When America is called a Judeo-Christian nation that has always been based on the original settlers and not the Founding Fathers.  Franklin, Jefferson and others were open atheists.  Even those who weren't like, Washington,  said that America WAS NOT a Christian nation.  The Pilgrims left religious persecution in Europe only to have the nation they formed create a new persecution.  How can we exclude the Protestant-hated Catholics,  or Jews ( part of Judeo-Christian when it suits the extreme),  and even Muslims.  Freedom of religion also means freedom FROM religion.    The value of universal moral teaching is not isolated to religion but using the framework of religion in moral teaching is turned into the realm of the fanatic.  When Jefferson wrote his Bible it was out of respect for the gentle nature of Christ's teachings and their appeal.  Today a person has to be an atheist or a fanatic.  No one can say they feel the Bible's teaching is a good moral guide because they will be labeled a fanatic or a closet-Christian.  As an atheist people tell me I secretly harbor a belief because I respect many of the things Christ said,  why is that.  Murder, rape, unprovoked violence, subjegation, and judgementalism would all be wrong even without religion.  Using a religious guide even when you have no belief is not going to turn you into Jerry Falwell.  The problem comes in when Jerry Falwell writes the laws based on the literal Book and not just guidance in it's examples of goodness.

      No stranger feeling than missing out on what is going on back home (yes I called it that).  Hearing about the wave of bombings and knowing I should be there makes me hope I wasn't really needed.  This latest incident brings home all the things I have been saying about the insurgents.  3 dead soldiers and 50+ civilians.  I think I'm going to force myself back early since my Father is getting better.  I miss my family but I still have a job.   What a fucking hero,  yawn.

      The worst part about politics is the politics. (I work for the Department of Redundency Department) As a Veteran and an angry Cuban who doesn't trust either party I am having issues with John Kerry's speach at the convention the other night.  He said everything I agree with and I mean everything.  Now comes the tricky part,  the seminal politician.  This is the man who made up stories about the so-called atrocities he was aware of in Vietnam.  He has fellow Dem's at his rallies slapping beach sandles to symbolize his flip-flopping on issues.  He made fun of Edwards as not being able to carry his own state how can he carry the Country and now has him as a running mate.    Now it gets dicey.  When you talk to many older Cubans they will tell you they supported Castro in his revolution against Battista.  Fact is Battista was a dictator,  capitalism and free trade were slathered around to the point Hong Kong would be jealous but, he was a dictator.  Now if you ask all of his detractors if you want him or Castro they stand and scream Battista.  This is my problem.  During Vietnam the phrase,  "Better the son-of-a-bitch you know than the son-of-a-bitch you don't know" was thrown around.  Pres. Bush is not the grand jury prize but we know exactly what he will do in a given situation,  delegate to Cheney. (sorry)  But Kerry is so tricky in that his words say something that made me question my hatred of the Dem's for the first time in my life.  His voting record, as I have seen, Shows other than his words would elude.  People can change, insert leopard comment here.  The majority of the states are Conservative in general thought and to the left when it touches their home.  The middle ground is the way this country will recover.  Schools and poverty are real problems as are foreign policy and warfare.  Abortion is only an issue when it's your daughter,  and only gun owners(me) care about guns. When the politicos realize we don't care about the party and do care about the wallet and the brood they can have a White House where all of us feel safe and comfortable with its residents.  Even when Michael Moore comes to dinner.
