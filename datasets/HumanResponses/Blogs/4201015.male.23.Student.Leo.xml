       The Blog fever seems to have got me like hell... So thanks to the great Creative king Alex Joseph... for bringing me in. So wat do i write? I have this problem that i never know wat to tell and wat to talk, in the process not talking anything and boring the person with me. After a long time i got to chat with Raja today.  And passed him the Spooph folder, so he is all happy &  Gay.        Yeah forgot to tell..... type i mean,  Myself, Atul &amp; Amit Sood(Atul's Friend) went to Rennaisance today. Dont ask me hwy... Isnt that obvious. I wouldnt say i liked the place, cos everyone looked so very artificial, no one was being their own self. And then the singing lady also was there... She was dressed in a dull brown gown, or whatever it is called, i didnt like it anyway. One thing of being in Bombay is that you get to see such varied places, such varied people, and of course beautiful girls in skimpy dresses. Well i guess there is nothing else to add, well might bw there is, but as it is pretty late, am going for my nap. It is about 4.00 a.m in the morning right now. O k Good night.....

       Hey guys...                  It was yet another memorable day today. Chinnapayan called me at 11.58pm, and was the first one to wish me. Just in case "someone" forgot it, it is my birthday today. Next as it is the ritual here, I had to show my innocent ass to guys(not nude), to the great football players of my batch. And they try their new style of kicking on the 2 footballs i have ;)Then as the ritual continues, all of them had a cool drink. Was lucky enough again, there were only about 40-45 people, as many of them were out of campus and others were busy watching movie on their PCs. So it saved on my ass.                  And the best part of the day, atleast as of now, was the surprise pack from CTS, that our Chennai team of Metal Roses had sent to me, thru Atul. The Wallet was just Fantabulous. And the card was really amazing, Was well chosen, must say... Finally even just about an hour or so after my day begun am happy. Lets see how the rest of the day goes. Hey Ashik, Sakthi and GK, thanks for the calls guys, you really made it a great start. And Sottai, thanks for the Birthday wishes... And thanks to Divya and Vibs too..C U guys... Will give an update on how m y day went...taata   Prakash
