      Most of the country ignored Oregon's late-season primary - Kerry cleaned up, no shock there. The big surprises came in the down-ballot races, including mayoral races in Portland and Eugene. The Oregonian  urlLink  summed it up:    If money talked in this Portland City Hall primary, it only mumbled. Its effects were drowned out in the cry for change. In a comeuppance for conventional wisdom, mayoral candidate Jim Francesconi drew fewer votes than his rival, Tom Potter, even though Francesconi raised nearly $1 million, outspending Potter by more than tenfold.    It was the same in Eugene, where the 'development-friendly' mayor and council that had dominated this left-leaning city where shown the door. By all accounts the progressive vote was angry and energized.  And if they came out to vote despite the lack of a major race at the top of the ballot, imagine what things will look like in November?

      The press is about to have a field day with  urlLink  Myrna Dick , the Missouri woman whose deportation has been blocked because she's pregnant, and " urlLink her fetus is an American Citizen ". The real story though, is this - how on earth did we come to live in a police state with absolutely no rights, and not even a marginal sense of fairness? Myrna Dick moved here with her parents as a young child, lived here all her life, followed all the rules, married an American, and is about to have his child. But when she went in to renew her work permit, a computer check turned up what may have been a lie she once told to a border guard. And that is that. Our ever-vigilant Departmentn of Homeland Security arrested her and scheduled her for immediate deportation. If it weren't for the fact that she was pregnant and came up with the novel fetal rights defense, she'd be gone already. So there you have it - we live in a country where the unborn have rights, but nobody else does.

      So who are the 'summer soldiers' who are turning on Bush's Iraq Policy?  urlLink  Matthew Yglesias  makes the excellent point that it's not a bunch of pinkos, or even disgruntled ex-Generals - is's folks like the  urlLink  Brookings Institute .   Ask yourself, is Kenneth Pollack really trying to make it look like his influential best-selling book was responsible for embroiling the United States in a debacle, or is he pessimistic because things aren't going well? Again, is The New Republic busy trying to discredit their own mixture of center-left domestic politics and neoconservative foreign policy, or are things just bad? Leaving them aside, Jim Hoagland? David Brooks? Bill Kristol? According to reports I've heard, David Frum is joining the ranks of the disgruntled. Is David Frum a partisan Democrat? Does he hate America? I rather think not. Pay some damn attention.

      The dust is still settling from yesterday's surprise announcement that the Iraqi Governing Council, which was supposed to have been shut out of the selection process for the new Iraqi government, has jumped in and named the new prime minister anyway. The US and UN quickly, albeit tentatively, endorsed the choice: Iyad Allawi. There has been plenty of reporting on Allawi since then (Jane Myer's piece in  urlLink  the New Yorker  covers it well - via Laura Rozen's excellent  urlLink  War and Piece ). Allawi was a prominent Iraqi exile (with little base of support inside the country); unlike Chalabi, he has support from the CIA. But no one that I've seen has noted the family bonds between Allawi and Chalabi: From  urlLink  Arab Media Watch:    · Governing council member Iyad Allawi is brother-in-law of the interior minister, Nouri Badran. He is also a cousin of the trade minister, Ali Allawi   · Besides being a cousin of Iyad Allawi, trade minister Ali Allawi is a nephew - twice - of governing council member Ahmed Chalabi. He is a nephew on his mother's side, and his father, Abdul-Amir Allawi, is also married to Chalabi's sister     FOLLOWUP: Alexander Cockburn, writing in  urlLink  Salon , notes that despite their family connection Allawi and Chalbai are old rivals:   There could be no more perfect evidence of the desperation among U.S. officials dealing with Iraq than the choice of veteran Baathist and CIA hireling Iyad Allawi as prime minister of the "sovereign" government due to take office after June 30. As one embittered Iraqi told me from Baghdad on Friday: "The appointment must have been orchestrated by Ahmed Chalabi in order to discredit the entire process."

      The  urlLink Washington Business Journal  reported last week:  Carlyle goes to the movies District-based investment firm The Carlyle Group is one of three investors that have agreed to buy Loews Cineplex Entertainment from Onex Corp. and Oaktree Capital Management for $1.46 billion.  The Loews chain owns 200 movie theaters. For those of you unfamiliar with the Carlyle Group, it's a $17-billion military industrial powerhouse with a lot of Saudi money backing it up. Bush Sr. was on the board and did a lot of schmoozing for the firm. The company does a lot of synergy - for instance, in the run-up to the Iraq invasion, they bought the largest cigarette-manufacturing firm in Italy, positioning them to supply the troops and make a bundle. And it was a target in "Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11", for its involvment in linking Saudi money with the Bushes. What would they want with movie theaters? Up until now the Rethuglicans have been able to work on their media mogul peers with the usual forms of pressure, blocking such things as the Reagan TV series on ABC and getting Disney to drop distribution of "Fahrenheit 9/11". But Moore did an end run, and got independent distribution. Solution? Buy up the theaters. Is anyone else thinking about Howard Beale's sermons in the film "Network" at this point?

      Curioser and curioser... When they won't answer a direct question, it's usually because they're hiding something. And Weasel Words work.  For instance, did the White House state that Karl Rover and (Cheney aid) Scooter Libby had nothing to do with the Plame leak? That's what the press has repeated in nearly every story on the subject. But if you go back and look at their actual words - they were  very very careful  to always say the two were "... not involved in the leak of classified information."  Does that mean they weren't involved in the Plame leak? Or does that mean that the White House, as some were arguing at the time, doesn't believe that  the fact that Valerie Plame was an undercover CIA agent  was classified information? Watch how it works in action - from  urlLink today's White House Press Gaggle :  Q Scott, are you able to say that the President has no information as to who leaked --  MR. McCLELLAN: Hang on one second, Mark. Remember, the President directed the White House to cooperate fully and that's why I said he was pleased to do his part to help this investigation.  Q Are you able to state that the President has no information as to who leaked the information regarding --  MR. McCLELLAN: Again, Mark, that's just getting into questions that are best directed to the officials in charge of the investigation. And I would not read anything into that one way or the other. This is an ongoing investigation. I think that the officials in charge would prefer that questions be directed to them.   Note what Press Secretary Scott McLellan does. Each time, he interrupts the questioners before the words "Valerie Plame" are out of their mouths. When you go back to search the record, you won't be able to find a single instance of Scott being asked "Did the president know who leaked the name of Valerie Plame" and him answering "no". Watch the Weasel Words in these two exchanges:  Q When did he actually retain Sharp? Meaning, when was he informed that this interview would take place?  MR. McCLELLAN: Recently.   Q Scott, could you, for us -- I know that you may not know now, but can you, for us, find out when the President retained Sharp?  MR. McCLELLAN: I think I would just describe it as recently.  Q Can you find out for us?  MR. McCLELLAN: I will look into it, but that's probably the extent to --  Q The President of the United States is retaining a private attorney --  MR. McCLELLAN: -- how I would characterize it.  Q I'm putting the inquiry in, then. When he retains -- the President is retaining a private attorney, we'd like to know what day it was.  MR. McCLELLAN: I appreciate that and if I have more on this, I'll let you know, I'll put it on the end of the gaggle transcript.   Needless to say, there has been (to date) no further information. Why not? The only possible reason is that Bush retained Sharp  right away , possibly as soon as the case went to Justice. Which would be a dead giveaway, wouldn't it?

      And we wonder why the CPA totally failed to bring about stability and democracy in Iraq? Maybe it's because we sent a bunch of bumbling young amateurs to do the job (and then didn't give them the tools). Via  urlLink Atrios , the  urlLink Wall Street Journal reports :  At Yale University, Jay Hallen majored in political science, rarely watched financial news stations and didn't follow the stock market. All of which made the 24-year-old an unlikely pick for the difficult task of rebuilding Iraq's shuttered stock exchange. But Mr. Hallen, a private-sector development officer for the U.S.-led Coalition Provisional Authority, was given the job immediately after arriving in Baghdad in September. ...Mr. Hallen, who graduated in 2001, has spent the past few months in a crash course in high finance. He has worked with a team of volunteer financial experts and lawyers from the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York and Philadelphia stock exchanges to revise and modernize the trading rules and disclosure requirements for the new market. He has created a watchdog agency for the exchange modeled on the SEC, and an association of Iraqi securities brokers. ...Mr. Hallen's most difficult task has been winning and keeping the confidence of Iraqi investors and traders alarmed by his youth and lack of experience in the financial sector. It hasn't been easy. ...[investment firm owner Luay] Elias's faith in Mr. Hallen, however, began to evaporate when the market's opening was delayed without explanation, first to the middle of this month and then into February. "Maybe someone older and more experienced could have gotten this done on time," Mr. Elias says.    This has been reported, but not widely: how the administration froze out State Department experts - even banning doctors who had supported abortion rights! - and instead hired a bunch of ideologically pure kids who had put resumes up on the website of the neocon-friendly Heritage Foundation.

      Am I the only one that thinks this is a suicidal idea, from a strategic standpoint? Democrats in Colorado are pushing a ballot initiative that will award proportional electoral votes. It takes effect immediately, so it'll apply for this election. But... As we've already seen, the Issa wing of the Repubs in California can and will pay to get ballot initiatives on. We can't really argue that what's good for democracy in Colorado is bad in California, right? Between the partisan Repub vote and the good-for-democracy vote, it'll pass easily. And then we can kiss close to half of Cali's electoral votes goodbye next cycle. The same could happen in other Dem electoral strongholds like New York and Illinois. (And don't hold your breath on Republican-dominated states like Florida, or the southern and western states, to reciprocate). The Republicans already have a built-in bias in the Electoral college (since it assigns electors based on House seats + Senators, small western states like Wyoming and North Dakota get three votes each, out of proportion to their population).  If the GOP keeps all of their base, and gets half of ours, we'll be locked out of the Electoral College for a generation.

      The customs service (now a division of the Department of Homeland Security) is UTTERLY out of control:  Marshmallow Bust Haunts Woman on Cruise CATHERINE WILSON Associated Press MIAMI - A teacher's aide who forgot to put away her marshmallows and hot chocolate at Yellowstone National Park last year was taken from her cruise ship cabin in handcuffs and hauled before a judge Friday, accused of failing to pay the year-old fine. Hope Clarke, 32, crying and in leg shackles, told the judge she was rousted at 6:30 a.m. by federal agents after the ship returned to Miami from Mexico. She insisted that she had been required to pay the $50 fine before she could leave Yellowstone, which has strict rules about food storage to prevent wildlife from eating human food. Customs agents meet all cruise ships arriving from foreign ports and run random checks of passenger lists, and a warrant claiming Clarke had not paid the fine was found in the federal law enforcement database. Assistant U.S. Attorney Peter Outerbridge conceded there were some "discrepancies," but suggested to the judge that Clarke appear in court again to clear up the warrant. U.S. Magistrate Judge John O'Sullivan, who had a copy of a citation indicating the fine had been paid, apologized to Clarke, who spent nearly nine hours in detention, and demanded that the U.S. attorney's office determine what went wrong. Zach Mann, spokesman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, called the arrest "an unfortunate set of circumstances." He added, "We were acting on what we believed was accurate information."

How many times do you turn the other cheek before striking back? Do you really understand desperation? What is the worst thing you ever did out of frustration? Is this what makes you "the good" and the target of "the evil" of the world? Do you understand poverty, self-worth, shame or hunger? What is corruption, oppression and isolation to you?

      So now the administration talking point is "We never said Saddam was involved with 9/11 - what we have always said is that they are  connected . They have long-standing and unquestionable  connections ." Let's dig out that lovely 1985 picture of Rumsfeld meeting with Saddam, shall we? The Reagan/Bush administration armed Saddam, sold him tanks and planes, gave him waivers to buy biological agents, turned a blind eye while he gassed his own people. The Bush team was giving Saddam hundreds of millions of dollars in agricultural credits (through BCCI!) that he was using to buy guns instead of butter. And of course, as Michael Moore points out, it's easy to show ties between the Bushes and the bin Ladens. Thats the missing link! Al Qaeda is tied to Saddam via... the Bush family!

       urlLink This  pretty much says it all.  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Investigators have found no evidence Iraq aided al Qaeda attempts to attack the United States, a commission investigating the Sept. 11, 2001 hijackings said on Wednesday, undermining Bush administration arguments for war.  The report by commission staff said al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden had met with a senior Iraqi intelligence officer in 1994 and had explored the possibility of cooperation, but the plans apparently never came to fruition.  President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney this week reiterated pre-war arguments that an Iraqi connection to al Qaeda, which is blamed for the Sept. 11 attacks, represented an unacceptable threat to the United States.  However, the commission said in a staff report, "We have no credible evidence that Iraq and al Qaeda cooperated on attacks against the United States."  "There is no convincing evidence that any government financially supported al Qaeda before 9/11 -- other than limited support provided by the Taliban after bin Laden first arrived in Afghanistan," it added.   Now let's see which newspapers pick it up, and how they spin it in their headlines....  FOLLOWUP:  The Washington Post pulls no punches.   urlLink No Evidence Connecting Iraq to Al Qaeda, 9/11 Panel Says  There is "no credible evidence" that Saddam Hussein's government in Iraq collaborated with the al Qaeda terrorist network on any attacks on the United States, according to a new staff report released this morning by the commission investigating the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.   CNN focuses their piece on 9/11 planning, and only halfway down hit the issue of Saddam ties:   urlLink No al Qaeda, Iraq cooperation .  The panel said it found "no credible evidence that Iraq and al Qaeda cooperated on attacks against the United States."  The report contradicts statements from the Bush administration that Saddam Hussein had ties to al Qaeda. In response, a senior administration official traveling with President Bush in Tampa, Florida, said, "We stand by what Powell and Tenet have said," referring to previous statements by Secretary of State Colin Powell and CIA Director George Tenet that described such links.  Bush and Vice President Cheney have made comments in recent days alleging such ties.   That seems straighforward, no? That's a big improvement from yesterday, when they gave us this piece of equivocating drivel:   urlLink Bush stands by al Qaeda, Saddam link  WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Bush repeated his administration's claim that Iraq was in league with al Qaeda under Saddam Hussein's rule, saying Tuesday that fugitive Islamic militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi ties Saddam to the terrorist network. "Zarqawi's the best evidence of a connection to al Qaeda affiliates and al Qaeda," Bush told reporters at the White House. "He's the person who's still killing." U.S. intelligence officials have said al Qaeda had some links to Iraq dating back to the early 1990s, but the nature and extent of those contacts is a matter of dispute.  Critics have accused the president and other administration officials of falsely inflating the links between Iraq and al Qaeda in the months before the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.  Halfway down the  urlLink  CNN main page  there's a poll: "Do you think Iraq and al Qaeda cooperated to attack the US on 9/11? The good news: 69 percent are now voting 'no' - which is twice what it was a few months ago. The bad news: 31 percent of Americans STILL believe....  Fox News may have helped by playing this headline on their website:  urlLink 9/11 Panel: No Evidence of Al Qaeda-Iraq Link .   The useful idiots at  urlLink  The New York Times  limit their coverage to a mere two graphs, hidden far down in their main report. Elsewhere, they reprint the AP report under the headline  urlLink Sept. 11 Commission Report Says Iraq Rebuffed Al Qaeda . Once you manage to find it, you learn:  Bluntly contradicting the Bush administration, the commission investigating the Sept. 11 attacks reported Wednesday there was ``no credible evidence'' that Saddam Hussein had ties with al-Qaida.  God bless the AP.

      Whether or not there were ties between Saddam and al Qaeda, Cheney would love to have us think that  now  we're battling Osama in the 'central front of the War on Terror". But  urlLink  this latest   looks just... weird.  CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- A leader of militants in Iraq has purportedly written to Osama bin Laden saying his fighters are being squeezed by U.S.-led coalition troops, according to a statement posted Monday on Islamic Web sites. ...Titled "The text of al-Zarqawi's message to Osama bin Laden about holy war in Iraq," the statement appeared on Web sites that have recently carried claims of responsibility for attacks in Saudi Arabia and Iraq. "The space of movement is starting to get smaller," it said. "The grip is starting to be tightened on the holy warriors' necks and, with the spread of soldiers and police, the future is becoming frightening." The statement says the militant movement in Iraq is racing against time to form battalions that can take control of the country "four months before the formation of the promised Iraqi government, hoping to spoil their plan." It appears to refer to the government that would take office after the elections scheduled for January 2005. Does anyone else think this is just a little too convenient? I'm waiting to hear  urlLink Juan Cole's  take on this. Until then, I'm just going to assume it's more disinformation. It couldn't be Chalabi. We confiscated all his computers last month...

      Why do so many Americans  still  believe, despite the total lack of evidence, that Saddam was involved in 9/11? Maybe becasue Dick Cheney keeps  lying  about it.  ORLANDO, Fla. - Vice President Dick Cheney (news - web sites) said Monday that Saddam Hussein (news - web sites) had "long-established ties" with al Qaida, an assertion that has been repeatedly challenged by some policy experts and lawmakers.  The vice president offered no details backing up his claim of a link between Saddam and al Qaida.  "He was a patron of terrorism," Cheney said of Hussein during a speech before The James Madison Institute, a conservative think-tank based in Florida. "He had long established ties with al Qaida."  urlLink  (More)   Colin Powell was embarrassed about it. Even W has fessed up.  urlLink Kos  links to this Times article from earlier this year (archived at  urlLink Truthout )   WASHINGTON, Jan. 8 - Secretary of State Colin L. Powell conceded Thursday that despite his assertions to the United Nations last year, he had no "smoking gun" proof of a link between the government of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and terrorists of Al Qaeda.       "I have not seen smoking-gun, concrete evidence about the connection," Mr. Powell said, in response to a question at a news conference. "But I think the possibility of such connections did exist, and it was prudent to consider them at the time that we did."       Mr. Powell's remarks on Thursday were a stark admission that there is no definitive evidence to back up administration statements and insinuations that Saddam Hussein had ties to Al Qaeda, the acknowledged authors of the Sept. 11 attacks. Although President Bush finally acknowledged in September that there was no known connection between Mr. Hussein and the attacks, the impression of a link in the public mind has become widely accepted - and something administration officials have done little to discourage.   When will Dick finally stop lying? Probably when the press starts calling him on it. This AP piece makes a halfhearted attempt, but really, why is it so difficult? It continues:  In making the case for war in Iraq (news - web sites), Bush administration officials frequently cited what they said were Saddam's decade-long contacts with al-Qaida operatives. They stopped short of claiming that Iraq was directly involved in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, but critics say Bush officials left that impression with the American public.   Note that the way this is worded, the casual reader could come away from this graph with the impression that the administration had cited  evidence  for a decade of contacts...  ...Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., countered that the Bush administration had "a sorry record in the war on terror." Graham, former chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, spoke Sunday in a conference call arranged by John Kerry (news - web sites)'s presidential campaign in anticipation of Cheney's speech.   Another typical fudge: appear to present both sides of the issue, but set it up as a 'he said/he said' without bothering to report any of the  evidence  the opposing side lays out. The issue here is Sadam's link with al Qaeda. How about a mention of Bush or Powell admitting  there was no link ? Nah.  The State Department said last week it was wrong in stating that terrorism declined worldwide last year in a report that the Bush administration initially cited as evidence it was succeeding against terrorism, Graham noted. Both the number of incidents and the toll in victims increased sharply, the department acknowledged.  If you do throw in evidence, make it as confusing as possible. This paragraph is a mishmash. Who admitted what? Who accused what? Who acknowledged what? Most folks will skate right over it... and anyway, the issue is Saddam/al Qaeda. So the average person comes away, yet again, with the impression that  there are links  between Saddam and al Qaeda - even if there is some argument over the degree.

      Did the Deputy Solicitor General, Paul Clement, deliberately lie to the US Supreme Court? Julie writes: From pp. 22-23 of the transcript of the oral argument in Padilla, which took place on April 28:   JUSTICE RUTH BADER GINSBURG: But if the law is what the executive says it is, whatever is "necessary and appropriate'' in the executive's judgment, as the resolution you gave us that Congress passed, it leads you up to the executive, unchecked by the judiciary. So what is it that would be a check against torture?DEPUTY SOLICITOR GENERAL PAUL CLEMENT: Well, first of all, there are treaty obligations. But the primary check is that just as in every other war, if a U.S. military person commits a war crime by creating some atrocity on a harmless, you know, detained enemy combatant or a prisoner of war, that violates our own conception of what's a war crime. And we'll put that U.S. military officer on trial in a court martial. So I think there are plenty of internal reasons -- JUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose the executive says mild torture, we think, will help get this information. It's not a soldier who does something against the Code of Military Justice, but it's an executive command. Some systems do that to get information.  DEPUTY SOLICITOR GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, our executive doesn't, and I think -- I mean --    Let's assume for the moment that we can infer from the reports from Newsweek and the Wall Street Journal that individuals within the Bush Administration formally authorized and justified the now-infamous procedures at Abu Ghraib (a contestable contention, I know).  Do the rules of professional responsibility provide for sanctioning attorneys who know or should have known that they were making false statements in oral arguments?  And in this sort of situation, which bar would have the authority to sanction?  DC or Supreme Court?

      It gets stupider and stupider...  On May 10, Buffalo, NY art professor Steve Kurtz had a REALLY bad day. His wife has a heart attack, he calls emergency personell. She dies - but someone gets suspicious of the test tubes and petri dishes he has around the house, materials he's preparing for an upcoming installation at the Mass MoCA art museum on "Free Range Grains". Welcome to the United States of Paranoia. In come the Homeland Security goons in full protective gear, they shut down the neighborhood, cart off all or Kurtz's materials, and bring him in for extented questioning. A month later, they still haven't returned anything - it's mainly bacterial cultures (e. coli, bacillus globigii and serratia) that test for genetic modifications in grains - and they're still talking about  urlLink Bioterrorism charges .  You'd think that once they determined that the bacteria  were harmless, they would admit their error and move on. But no - they've empanelled a grand jury, and were  urlLink  handing out subpoenas  to more artists at the exhibit opening at Mass MoCa.  urlLink (More)

      One item that got lost in last week's hagiographical orgy was the news that W has  urlLink consulted a lawyer  about the Plame investigation. John Dean, who knows a bit about Presidential counseling (and coverups)  urlLink explains  that it's about attorney/client privilege, the shield that allows Bush to talk to a lawyer and keep any 'confessions' secret:  Readers may wonder, why is Bush going to an outside counsel, when numerous government attorneys are available to him - for instance, in the White House Counsel's Office? Ironically, it was the fair-haired Republican stalwart Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr who decimated the attorney-client privilege for government lawyers and their clients... Starr persuaded the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia... [which]ruled that exposure of wrongdoing by government lawyers fostered democracy, as "openness in government has always been thought crucial to ensuring that the people remain in control of their government." ... I spoke with an experienced former federal prosecutor who works in Washington... That attorney told me that he is baffled by Bush's move - unless Bush has knowledge of the leak. "It would not seem that the President needs to consult personal counsel, thereby preserving the attorney-client privilege, if he has no knowledge about the leak," he told me.   The point is somewhat circuitous, but clear: If Bush has nothing to hide, he can consult with the White House Counsel. If he DOES have something to hide, then Kenneth Starr has ironically made the White House Counsel vulnerable on attorney/client, so Bush needs a private lawyer. What does Bush have to hide? Look at his own words. Last September,  urlLink CNN  reported him saying that he does not know of "anybody in my administration who has leaked classified information." But from the beginning, the White House talking point was to question whether the information revealed was actually classified... Here's Scott McClellen in the  urlLink  White House Press Briefing of October 1st , the day after that Bush statement.  MR. McCLELLAN: Was it known that that information was classified?  Q Well, as a matter of policy --  MR. McCLELLAN: I think that's an important question. Was it known that information was classified information?  Q The article certainly identified Valerie Plame as a CIA operative. That fact presumably was not known --  MR. McCLELLAN: And the columnist said that it was his understanding that that individual was an analyst.  Q -- we don't know what he --  MR. McCLELLAN: But did the article say, "classified information," though? I mean, there are all sorts of "ifs" and "buts" in that question that would be difficult for me to answer from this podium. I think that's for -- the Department of Justice is looking at all this.  Here's the formula: on the one hand, deny the information leaked was classified. Then, later, use the wording "They were not involved in the leak of classified information." NOT "They were not involved in leaking the name of Valerie Plame and the fact that she was a CIA operative to the press." It depends on what the meaning of 'is' is, doesn't it? Josh Marshall  urlLink called them  on it at the time:  McClellan's 'denials' have hinged on a lawyerly and off-point claim that they were "not involved in leaking classified information." Here's the exchange ... QUESTION: Scott, earlier this week you told us that neither Karl Rove, Elliot Abrams nor Lewis Libby disclosed any classified information with regard to the leak. I wondered if you could tell us more specifically whether any of them told any reporter that Valerie Plame worked for the CIA? MCCLELLAN: Those individuals -- I talked -- I spoke with those individuals, as I pointed out, and those individuals assured me they were not involved in this. And that's where it stands. QUESTION: So none of them told any reporter that Valerie Plame worked for the CIA? MCCLELLAN: They assured me that they were not involved in this. QUESTION: Can I follow up on that? QUESTION: They were not involved in what? MCCLELLAN: The leaking of classified information. ...So, when McClellan was asked to be more clear, he opted for a meaninglessly vague statement and then fell back on the "leaking of classified information" dodge.  Can we all take note of this now? That denial wasn't what it seemed to be. In fact, I doubt it was a real denial at all.

      John Crudele, writing for that well-known liberal rag, the  New York Post , has been  urlLink looking at the numbers  behind the recent job statistics.  And he doesn't like what he sees:  ...the bottom line is that most of the 288,000 jobs that the Labor Department says were created last month may not really exist. ...Back in the March employment report, the government added 153,000 positions to its revised total of 337,000 new jobs because it thought (but couldn't prove) loads of new companies were being created in this economy.  That estimate comes from the Labor Department's "birth/death model." You can look up these numbers on the Department's Web site.  As staggering as the assumption about new companies was in March, the Labor Department got even more brazen in April.  Last Friday, it was disclosed that these imaginary jobs had been increased by 117,000 to 270,000 for the latest month - because, I guess, the stat jockeys got a vision from the gods of spring.  Without those extra 117,000 make-believe jobs, the total growth for April would have been just 171,000 - sub-par for an economy that's supposed to be growing at more than 4 percent a year, but right on the pros' targets...   This inspired  urlLink Richard Torgarson  to go behind the numbers - he includes a  urlLink link  to the full Bureau of Labor Statistics methodology, which is online. And based on his  urlLink reading , he's afraid that "fully 88 percent of the new jobs created since March 2003 are imaginary."  When this birth/death model was created in 1998, it was expected that it would change the results to a modest "small and stable" degree. Indeed for the 11 months from March 2003 through January 2004, a modest 37,000 average jobs per month were added by this technique. Something happened though after that. Over the last four months (February through May 2004) this modeling technique padded the total job growth by over 730,000 jobs, about 183,000 per month.

      Interesting. Scott O. Wright, the judge who ruled that Myrna Dick couldn't be deported because her unborn child is a U.S. citizen, is also the judge that ruled against Missouri's 1999 partial-birth abortion ban. What's different in this case? The Lacy Peterson "Victim Protection Act", which gives equal protection status to the unborn fetus. It's a pity that nobody but the The Kansas City Star has picked up on  urlLink  this:   In court, [Judge Wright] said that if Scott Peterson could be charged with the murder of an unborn child, then the government could not deport an unborn child who had done nothing wrong. But then what about abortion? Wright, citing the abortion exception in the Unborn Victims of Violence Act, said the new law did not contradict Roe v. Wade. “I'm against abortion, personally, but I feel like it's a woman's choice,” Wright said. “And we still have Roe versus Wade. As long as it's on the books, then that's the law.”  The fact that the government was clearly acting stupidly may have contributed to his ruling. This is a woman who has lived her entire life in the US, is married to a US citizen, and who is being deported for allegedly lying to a border guard once in 1998 - an offense which our kind and gentle Homeland Security Department insists requires her immediate deportation.

       urlLink This  is just about the funniest thing I've read this political season...   BUSHIDO:THE WAY OF THE ARMCHAIR WARRIOR by EVAN EISENBERG  Knowledge is not important. The armchair warrior strives to attain a state beyond knowledge, a state of deep, non-knowing connection to the universe: in particular, to that portion of the universe which is rich, powerful, or related to him by blood.  The unenlightened speak of “failures of intelligence.” But the armchair warrior knows that “intelligence”—the effort of the mind to observe facts, apply reason, and reach conclusions about what is true and what ought to be done—is a delusion, making the mind turn in circles like an ass hitched to a mill. The armchair warrior feels in his hara, or gut, what ought to be done. He is like a warhorse that races into battle, pulling behind him the chariot of logic and evidence. When the people see the magnificent heedlessness of his charge, they cannot help but be carried along...( urlLink read the whole thing )

      Matthew Yglesias sets off a bit of a discussion on the  urlLink  estate tax  ...One thing worth noting about Bush's much-ballyooed repeal is this: it barely exists. Remember how, in order to placate moderate Repubs and get the votes they needed to pass the last tax cut, they stuck in all sorts of sunset provisions that kept the total cost of the cuts down to something palatable? The Estate Tax Repeal is part of that. The Tax isn't actually removed until 2010 (bad luck if you die before then)- and then the repeal is sunsetted the very next year!  The way it's written, "the repeal is really a suspension of the tax for one year," says Mark West of the Principal Financial Group, in Des Moines, which specializes in retirement and financial services. ( urlLink link )  This saved a lot of money (on paper) and helped get the tax plan through Congress - but it's bullshit policy.  So the truly interesting question is this... how many elderly millionaires will see the narrow window of opportunity, and do the morally responsible thing - commit suicide in 2010 in order to save their children from the holocaust of government expropriation?

      What's significant about this: the media has seemed perfectly happy to report every niggling thing about Dems, but has tended to give Rethugs a pass on  everything . I really hope this is a sign that the human beings who compose the news have started to notice what bastards the Rethugs are, and rethink their collaboration....   urlLink Reuters, on Yahoo News : "Unhappy Workers Should Take Prozac --Bush Campaigner Thu Jul 29, 1:50 PM ET WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A campaign worker for President Bush (news - web sites) said on Thursday American workers unhappy with low-quality jobs should find new ones -- or pop a Prozac to make themselves feel better.  'Why don't they get new jobs if they're unhappy -- or go on Prozac?' said Susan Sheybani, an assistant to Bush campaign spokesman Terry Holt.  The comment was apparently directed to a colleague who was transferring a phone call from a reporter asking about job quality, and who overheard the remark.  When told the Prozac comment had been overheard, Sheybani said: 'Oh, I was just kidding.'  While recent employment growth has buoyed Bush's economic record, Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry (news - web sites) has argued the new jobs are not as good as those lost due to outsourcing in recent years.  Nearly 1.1 million jobs have been lost since Bush took office in January 2001. "

       urlLink Abu Aardvark  on Arab liberal frustration:  I had a long talk today with a very prominent Arab liberal, who I'm not at liberty to identify, but who I consider to be one of the very smartest and most incisive of the Arab intelligentsia. This is someone with a long record of condemning Saddam Hussein and of supporting democratization.. in short, the very definition of the kind of guy you want on your side if you are an American promoting reform in the Middle East.  The frustration and bitterness this individual expressed towards the Bush administration was striking even to me. He feels betrayed and alienated by Bush's policies. He is deeply suspicious of everything and anything that they now say. He has absolutely no confidence in Bush's democracy rhetoric, and feels that Arab liberals are worse off today than ever before.  Listening to him really drove home to me how much Bush has cost us in the region.

You've been hearing from the right side of the blogosphere how this was 'multiple-sourced' - so even though the main evidence Saddam was going after African uranium turns out to be a ludicrous forgery, we still have a strong case based on the other sources. Right?  My summary of the sources:  1) There was an Italian report (which it turns out was based on the forgeries)  2) There was a French report (which it turns out was based on the forgeries)  3) There was an Italian follow-up with more details (based on - you guessed it! The forgeries!)  Then there were our own reports:  1) An Algerian businessman who says he set up a meeting between Iraqis and Niger (actual yellowcake discussed: none)  2) A report from the President of Niger that he met with an Iraqi embassador (actual yellowcake discussed: none)  3) A naval intelligence report of a phone call from another West African businessman, claiming the uranium for Iraq was in a warehouse in Benin, and leaving a phone number for them to contact him. A month later they checked the warehouse: it was full of cotton bales. They never called the phone number, or attempted to contact the man (initiative, or even follow-through: none)  4) (This is my favorite) Someone in intelligence got a hold of a fax, in the posession of a Somali businessman, " "that appeared similar to the amount in the Iraq-Niger yellowcake deal. The fax, however, did not mention uranium, Iraq, or Niger."  Imagine that! somewhere on the continent of Africa somebody was shipping X tons of SOMETHING that month.  And that, my friends, is the 'evidence' the Bush administration used to convince us that Iraq had a nuclear program.

       urlLink Lincoln on the 1864 Presidential Election :  November 10, 1864     It has long been a grave question whether any government, not too strong for the liberties of its people, can be strong enough to maintain its own existence in great emergencies.     On this point the present rebellion brought our republic to a severe test; and a presidential election occurring in regular course during the rebellion added not a little to the strain. If the loyal people, united, were put to the utmost of their strength by the rebellion, must they not fail when divided, and partially paralized (sic), by a political war among themselves?     But the election was a necessity.     We can not have free government without elections; and if the rebellion could force us to forego, or postpone a national election it might fairly claim to have already conquered and ruined us. The strife of the election is but human-nature practically applied to the facts of the case. What has occurred in this case, must ever recur in similar cases. Human-nature will not change. In any future great national trial, compared with the men of this, we shall have as weak, and as strong; as silly and as wise; as bad and good. Let us, therefore, study the incidents of this, as philosophy to learn wisdom from, and none of them as wrongs to be revenged.     But the election, along with its incidental, and undesirable strife, has done good too. It has demonstrated that a people's government can sustain a national election, in the midst of a great civil war. Until now it has not been known to the world that this was a possibility. It shows that, even among candidates of the same party, he who is most devoted to the Union, and most opposed to treason, can receive most of the people's votes.

      From this week's  urlLink President's Radio Address :  "The union of a man and woman in marriage is the most enduring and important human institution, and the law can teach respect or disrespect for that institution. If our laws teach that marriage is the sacred commitment of a man and a woman, the basis of an orderly society, and the defining promise of a life, that strengthens the institution of marriage. If courts create their own arbitrary definition of marriage as a mere legal contract, and cut marriage off from its cultural, religious and natural roots, then the meaning of marriage is lost, and the institution is weakened." Um... if you actually  read  the bible, you will note that marriage is NOT limited to 'one man, one woman'. Abraham had one wife and several concubines. Jacob had two wives and several concubines. King David had several wives; his son Solomon was reputed to have one thousand.  Mormons practiced polygamy; they had to officially drop it as a condition for Utah becoming a state, but you still read every year about some back-country Mormons running afoul of the law. There are lots of places all over the world where polygamy is still practiced. So - if the Christian Church believes that marriage today should only be between one man and one woman, that's just fine  for them . But since their own holy books can't make up their mind on the subject, I don't see why we should have to put  this month's  Christian doctrine into the Constitution of the United States - a document which our fouding fathers saw fit to separate  entirely  from Church doctrine.

       urlLink FBI harrasment of artist continues    Dr. Steven Kurtz, Associate Professor of Art at the University of Buffalo, was arraigned and charged in Federal District Court in Buffalo today on four counts of mail and wire fraud (United States Criminal Code, Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1341 and 1343), which each carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.   The arraignment of Dr. Robert Ferrell, Professor of Genetics at the University of Pittsburgh, who was indicted along with Kurtz, has been postponed for a week for health reasons.   The defendants were charged not with bioterrorism, as listed on the Joint Terrorism Task Force's original search warrant and subpoenas, but with a glorified version of 'petty larceny,' in the words of Kurtz attorney Paul Cambria. The laws under which the indictments were obtained are normally used against those defrauding others of money or property, as in telemarketing schemes." This is more than nuts. The guy was cultivating harmless bacteria as part of an (antiwar) art project; the materials were seen by paramedics who entered the house  because his wife was dying ! And what does our government do to this university art professor in his time of grief? Arrests him on suspicion of bioterror! Of course, there was never any evidence of 'bioterrorism' - but they're going ahead and indicting him anyway, with. Why? So that Ashcroft can crow about making another terror arrest. That's right - when they brag about the terror suspects they've nabbed, these two guys will be right up there padding the numbers. Read  urlLink  the whole thing

       urlLink Juan Cole  reports on the Bush Admin's outing of our first al Qaeda mole. You heard right - in order to justify their fearmongering Terror Alert last week, "administration sources" released the name of the guy they had gotten the info from. Turns out he was cooperating with the Pakistanis, had been sending emails out to al Qaeda cells in Britain, the US and other places, and was helping gather info that would have enabled them to be arrested and prosecuted. Of course, the moment the press revealed that he had been arrested and was cooperating, that blew all of those ongoing operations out of the water. The Brits rounded up as many as they could, but five escaped and are at large. And there probably isn't enough evidence to hold several others.  Note that there have been no arrests in this country - I guess Ashcroft is too busy trying to decide what color today should be, entrapping pizza-parlour owners in Albany, and chasing down manufacturers of drug paraphenalia to investigate and arrest actual terrorists. The whole thing is just disgusting.
