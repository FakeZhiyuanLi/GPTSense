      I read this book on the recommendation of Cristi.  While her taste is more for classics, and I tend to lean towards the silly forgettable "chick lit" types, I really enjoyed this one.  It's called (and don't let this stop you from reading it) A Girl Named Zippy by Haven Kimmel.  Seldom do I laugh out loud at a book, but I did on more than one occasion reading this one.  Tell me what you think.

      Yesterday, in my attempt to keep little Eric occupied with something to do while we waited for the neighbor to finish her horseback riding lesson, I told him to look for a 4-leaf clover on the patch of grass we were sitting on.  (How's THAT for a run-on sentence?!?  Oh well, this isn't English class)  I looked for a three-leaf clover as an example, when lo and behold, I came across an actual, bona fide four leaf clover, something I have been looking for all of my 25 years for!  I remember being an annoying chatterbox of a 5-year-old, and my own mom, to get me off her back, talking her ear off, would send me outside to look for a four leaf clover.  As I carefully carried the four-leaf clover to the car between two tightly clenched fingers, I thought, I guess it goes to show that when you least expect to find something, you stumble upon it.

      So yesterday, I was walking with little 4-year-old Eric to the "small park" as he calls it, and we were holding hands to walk across the street.  I've started to get a little sad about leaving him, so I looked down at him and said, "Eric, you're my best guy."  After a pause, he looked up and me and said very matter-of factly, "I know."  I'm going to miss him!

      Has anyone taken Amtrak anywhere for a great distance?  I am seriously thinking about taking the train from Framingham, Mass back home to Provo.  It's not that much more than a one-way airplane ticket.  It would be a cool way to see the country, but I don't want to get so bored I tear all my hair out by the time I get home, either...

      I've been wanting to do this for awhile, and finally got bored enough to get it going.  I'll be doing this from Utah soon--I had The Talk with my employer last night and will be going home at the end of July.  Whooop dee doo!!

      Last night we went to the Braves (vs. Marlins) game.  My adorable 3-year-old niece was on the jumbo tron!  She was standing on my sister's lap dancing around.  How often does that happen?!?  Have any of you been "featured" on the Jumbo Tron?  And speaking of the jumbo tron, my sister hasn't heard of that term--she just calls it the big screen.  My brother-in-law and I were making fun of her for it.  What would you call it?  Oh, yeah...the Braves lost last night, but they won tonight!!  We didn't go tonight because it was raining, but we may go again tomorrow night.

      YEA!  I'm done with the nanny thing!!  I miss the kids a ton already, but I'm SO GLAD to be with my own family again.  I'm visiting my sister, brother in law, niece & nephew in Georgia.    My niece was sitting on my lap and was looking at my currently broken-out face and said, "Annie, why do you have so many mosquito bites?"  Of course this made my sister laugh really hard, but I didn't find it as funny.  What I do find funny, though, is the on-ramp to the highway closest to my sister's house.  There are about 15 No Parking signs along the on-ramp, within about 10 feet from each other.  And people are surprised to hear that Georgia is #49 out of the 50 states when it comes to elementary testing scores.

      This morning I went to Salem, Massachusetts with a friend from the ward who wanted to show me around there.  Our first stop was at a candy factory in Glouscester.  It was run by a bunch of old glaring grouchy ladies who didn't know how to smile.  There were signs all over, telling you not to touch anything, and that if you wanted to buy anything, you had to ask one of the old ladies to wrap it up for you.  We each got a couple pieces of chocolate, and I have to say they were pretty good.    Our next stop was in Salem, where we walked all over the historic district.  We didn't go inside any museums (much to my dismay) but we sure saw a lot of weird people walking around dressed entirely in black.  There were a bunch of little shops with signs out front promoting tarot card and palm readings.  I thought it would be funny to go and have a reading, but the person I was with didn't.  Oh, well.    Driving around, I saw a couple of things that made me laugh--a FOR RENT sign outside someone's house that said "FOR RENT:  ROOMMATE."  I've wanted to rent out a couple of my roommates before, too!  I also saw a bumper sticker that said, "Dog Trainers do it with praise."  Now that's one I haven't seen before.   And that about sums up my little road trip.  Fun place, but next time I go, (and who knows when that will be; I'm going home next Saturday) I'm going to get my palm read.

      I went to visit Eric in New York this last weekend, and was shockingly asked for directions three times!!  Either I looked like I knew where I was going, or I just looked approachable.  I'd like to think it was a little of both.  When I was first asked where Broadway was, I just looked blankly at the lady who was asking, simply surprised that someone would ask me, a lowly Utah girl, only in New York for her, oh, 5th time, where the famous landmark street was.  It was even more amazing to me that each time I was asked where something was, I knew the answer!!    I'm not saying I'm going to be a tour guide, but dang, it felt good to know the right answer.

      The other day I was with Mia (the 2-year-old I take care of) at her music class.  There are about 5 other little kids there who come with their moms, dads, or nannies.  There is one lady who is a little nutty, and always makes the strangest comments.  Well, the latest strange comment she made to me was, "My feet are always sweaty."  I looked at her and said, "That's gross."  before I could even stop myself from saying something else less...rude.  She stopped talking to me.  So my question is...was I rude?  Or was her comment something you just don't share with someone?!?

      Since being in Maine for Memorial Day weekend is about as warm as being in Utah in March, (it wasn't warm enough to go on the lake, and the lake was no longer frozen over enough to go snowmobiling.) there wasn't a whole lot to do.  Why anyone would want to live in Maine is beyond me!!  But I did get to see a bunch of movies that I hadn't gotten around to seeing yet.  Here's what I thought of them:  1)  21 Grams with Sean Penn, Benicio Del Toro and Naomi Watts:  ***1/2 out of 4.  Very interesting story.  The movie is shown in little parts, all mixed up, so it's really quite confusing at first.  You catch on, though.  It ends up being VERY good, with GREAT performances by Naomi Watts and Sean Penn.  Lots of bad language, and a pretty, uh, graphic sex scene, but overall, it's great.  2)  Calendar Girls with a bunch of older (well, my Mom's age, so they aren't that old) English ladies, including Helen Mirren:  ** out of 4.  I didn't really have any desire to see this movie, but what else are you going to do at night in the middle of nowhere?  There are some funny parts, but mostly it's just a movie for Moms to see.  3)  Alex and Emma with Kate Hudson and Luke Wilson.  1/2 * out of 4.  Blaaaaahhhhh.  I fell asleep early on, and didn't miss much.    4)  The Girl with the Pearl Earring with Colin Firth and Scarlett Johansson:  ***1/2 out of 4.  Tells the story behind Johann Vermeer's painting with the same name.  I just studied this painting in Art History before coming here, so I really liked this movie.  Excellend cinematography, and Scarlett Johansson is great in it.  If anyone saw The Others with Nicole Kidman, the same little creepy girl is in this movie, and I swear she is pure evil.  The only dumb thing about the movie is the end.  That about wraps up my weekend, although we did go to Portland for a few hours one day--cool town, reminds me of Savannah, Georgia, which is one of my favorite towns.

      For once in my nearly five years at work, I was star-struck when Matthew Perry from "Friends" fame stayed at our resort for a few days last week.&nbsp; He stayed under the name "Alvy Singer," who, for you Woody Allen fans, is a character from the movie Annie Hall.&nbsp; I took this to be a sign...he likes a movie called Annie Hall, how about falling&nbsp;in love&nbsp;with&nbsp;the concierge named Annie??&nbsp;   Didn't work.&nbsp; I guess a girl can always dream.&nbsp; When you dream, dream big, as my Mom says.&nbsp; But he is very nice in real life,&nbsp; very funny, not unlike Chandler...but not as obnoxious, either.&nbsp;   I love my job!

      It was my first day back as a concierge at a resort in Utah that shall remained unnamed (until I forget, and then I'll mention it)  I got all caught up on who (celebrity-wise) has been there.    Up the road from this resort I work at is a small, privat re-hab center where MANY celebrities go.  Today Mary-Kate Olsen's parents checked out of our resort--they had been visiting Mary Kate as she was in re-hab.  Recent magazines say that Mary Kate is being treated for anorexia, but I am here to tell you that she is being treated for drug and alcohol abuse.    I also was told that David Hasselhoff was a recent guest of the re-hab facility.  Just goes to show that money doesn't buy happiness!

      Okay, so I've been home for a few days, so I've had a chance to chill.  Now I can tell the story calmly (maybe).    On Friday, my brother-in-law dropped me off at the Atlanta airport with plenty of time to catch my flight home to Salt Lake (via Denver).  Seeing as I was moving home from my days as a nanny in Boston, I had quite the load of luggage--one huge suitcase on wheels, a giant duffel bag (standing on one end, it's almost as tall as I am...which isn't saying much, but still), and then to carry on the plane, I had a big black duffel bag (that i could sling over my shoulder, but it was so heavy, it cut off the circulation in my arm) and a smaller leather hand bag that had a book and my cd player (discman) in it.  Kurt (my bro-in-law) had my niece & nephew with him because my sister was at work, so he just dropped me off at the curb.   Unfortunately, Frontier didn't have curb-side check-in at the Atlanta airport, so I had to s-l-o-w-l-y walk down to their counter inside the airport.  Luckily a nice airport employee saw me and put everything on a cart and walked me down to the counter.  The line wasn't too long, and the guy dropped off my luggage, I tipped him and he was on his way.    I got to the front of the line and awkwardly got my bags on the scale and gave the lady my ID.  She said, "Miss Reeder, your bags are much too heavy."  Figuring this would happen, I said, "What can I do?"  She said, "This bigger bag is 30 pounds overweight and the smaller one is 1 pound overweight."  I said, 'Okay, I realize that they are heavy, what can I do?"  She said, "This bigger one alone will cost you $100 to get on the plane, and the smaller one will be $50."  I said, "You're going to make me pay $50 for the bag that is one pound overweight?!?"  She nodded.  (So I figured I'd take out the extra pound and stuff it into my big duffel bag somehow to avoid the $50)  Then I said, "Huh, I just flew here from Boston and Delta let me on the plane without paying anything extra."  She said, "I doubt that very much."  I said, "They did!!  But okay, whatever.  Can I write a check?"  She said, "Your Drivers' License is from Utah.  What about your check?"  I said, "My account is still in Boston."  She shook her head and said, 'Then I can't take a check."  I said, "I've written checks here in Georgia, in Boston, and in Utah using my Utah ID and this checking account.  I really can't write you a check?"  She shook her head again.  I said, "Then what am I supposed to do?!?"  She shrugged her shoulders and said, 'You'll have to take your bags and step aside until you figure that out."  So I called Kurt to see if he could come back to the airport and take some of my stuff back to their house and mail it later.  While I waited for him to answer, i took off an orange tag that delta had attached to my duffel bag that said, "HEAVY" and looking around, didn't see a trash can, so I tossed it over the counter, knowing that the lady would have one.  Kurt answered his phone and said he'd be right there.    I struggled with my bags outside, and Kurt pulled up a few minutes later.  I opened my duffel, throwing sweaters and other items of clothing into their trunk.  Then I took out what I figured would be a pound worth of stuff from my suitcase and zipped them both shut.  Some nice American Airlines employees saw what I was doing and offered to weigh my bags to make sure they were under 50 pounds after I told them my predictiment.  They were laughing the whole time saying they couldn't believe the lady wouldn't let me check the suitcase with one pound over.  Once I got the weight down to 50 pounds each, Kurt took off and the American sky cap helped me back inside.    I got to the front of the line once again, and this time a guy was going to help me.  But this other guy came around from behind the counter and said, 'Miss, I'd like you to step aside with me for a moment."  I said, "Oh-kay." He said, "My employee said you threw this [holding up the orange 'HEAVY' tag] agressively at her, and I'd like to hear your side of the story." I said, "Excuse me?!?"  They weren't going to let me on the plane!!!!!  I told him how rude she was and how she was so unwilling to work with me and how frustrating it had been, and how she had no customer service skills whatsoever.  He said, "Okay, okay, I can see you're upset.  Do you feel okay flying with us today?"  I told him I just wanted to get home at this point and that I meant no offense against him personally, but I would never fly Frontier again.  He said he'd go to the gate once the plane was to depart and make sure I was okay.    Once I got to the gate, I had calmed down.  They began boarding, and when I got up to the front, the ticket lady said, "Um, this bag of yours may have to be checked."  I said, "Umm, no.  I've carried it on plenty of times and have never had a problem."  She said, 'Okay, go ahead, but if there's not room in the overhead bins, you'll have to check it."  And it fit in the damn overhead bin perfectly.  Interesting.    So when traveling the friendly skies, it is my suggestion that you avoid using Frontier...

      I have never had the sensation of being "weak in the knees" over a guy until recently.  Quite recently.  Okay, on Thursday.  I highly recommend it, it's fabulous.  I can only hope it happens again.  Soon.

      ...that Chandler (aka Matthew Perry) told me that I should do the morning Wake-Up calls for our guests because I have such a nice voice.  I was thinking, "I'll give you a wake-up call every morning." but instead said, "thanks."  I don't get tongue-tied very often.  But it's not every day you have a conversation with a celebrity.
