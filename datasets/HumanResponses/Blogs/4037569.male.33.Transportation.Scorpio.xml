             computer   (SEE:  urlLink MDT )        fare      Passengers in or waiting on the taxi. A customer. The cost of the cab ride.         farebox  fare box   (SEE:  urlLink MDT )        GOA   (SEE:  urlLink no-show )     G one  O n  A rrival.         MDT     M obile  D ata  T erminal.    Also referred to as  'the moneymaker'.  The computerized dispatching system component mounted in the taxi that displays fare information including: Fares available by zone; Special messages from the dispatch supervisor; and The information (address, name, destination, etc) about your current fare if it was dispatched. It also allows the driver to communicate with the dispatcher using codes that send pre-defined messages. It works in conjunction with the  urlLink two-way radio  by sending and receiving data over radio frequencies.        no-show     The bane of all Taxi Drivers' existence. Customers who for whatever reason no longer need a taxi but fail to call and cancel. Usually it is because they took a different taxi or found some other form of transportation. It wastes our time and money on multiple levels. Some drivers have been known to decorate houses with mud or excrement following a no-show. IF YOU DO NOT NEED YOUR TAXI, PLEASE CALL AND CANCEL IT!        runoff  run-off     The other bane (see  urlLink no-show ) of all Taxi Drivers' existence.   A thief, if you will.  A customer who, by deception or other means, does not pay the meter fare for thier ride. This includes jumpers, who as soon as the cab stops throw open thier door and  jump out ; and people who wait until you are at the destination to mention that they have no money. They take money out of our pockets!        radio      The two-way radio used by the MDT to communicate with the dispatch computer and occasionally for voice communications with the dispatcher(s) or supervisor.  The AM/FM radio that  may or may not  work depending on which cab you're in.         shift     The time spent driving the cab. Anywhere from 6 to 15 hours, with the standard being 12.        zone     One of about 70 areas of the county, usually bounded by major streets, highways, railroads, or natural features.  Zones vary in size and are based on the average number of  urlLink fares  for that particular area, and the layout of the streets.  You can tell the  urlLink computer  what zone you're in, and any run in that zone will come to you first (provided there are no other cabs in that zone).

      (FROM 07.25.04)  Sunday morning at about 3:30, I had just been to the west side for what ended up a  urlLink no-show , so I decided to grab a bite to eat. At this hour on a Sunday morning, food choices are few and far between. McDonalds and White Castle. White Castle wins tonight. I ordered my food to go so that I could eat it in the cab. As I was eating my chicken ring sandwich with cheese and three bacon cheeseburgers, my  urlLink computer  popped up a  urlLink fare  a couple of blocks away.&nbsp;&nbsp; I heard what sounded like arguing from the gas station across the street, but it was not unusual in this area.&nbsp;While I continued eating,&nbsp;a prostitute came up and bummed a cigarette and a light from me&nbsp;before discussing her work schedule with her pimp.&nbsp; He apparently wanted her to work overtime&nbsp;and I think she wanted to file a grievance.&nbsp;&nbsp;  I finished eating, which if you are familiar with the size of sandwiches at White Castle, you know took no time.&nbsp; I pulled out into the mall parking lot and stopped at the entrance traffic light, which was in flash mode.&nbsp; I&nbsp;was turning left, which would take me in front of the gas station. As I started&nbsp;through the light,&nbsp;my foot quickly left the accelerator and hit the brake as&nbsp;the unmistakable sound of gunshots rang out.&nbsp; CLOSE.&nbsp;&nbsp;Apparently the argument at the gas station did not turn out as expected by at least one of the parties, who was firing at a Cadillac&nbsp;&nbsp;that immediately started to pull out of the station.&nbsp; I'm basically  shitting down my leg  at this point,&nbsp;while trying to drive and dial 9-1-1 on the cell phone.  Let me tell you - Gunshots will wake your ass up!&nbsp; I still don't know exactly what happened, or if anyone was hit, but it was definitely a little more excitement than I'm used to.
