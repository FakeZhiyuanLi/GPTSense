       NEXT GOAL  143 by the end of Week 3...but since I won't be near a scale for two weeks, my goal is actually to be 142 by the time I return.   WEIGHT  143 (on June 26)  OK, well this weekend was a complete mess for dieting! I flew across the country on Saturday and then had two showers with TONS of dessert. Since the showers were in my honor, I couldn't very well not eat the food they brought (and they specifically picked foods they knew I liked, so I couldn't resist anyway).   Aside from the showers, I did well. Ate salad and turkey sandwiches for dinners, fruit and oatmeal for breakfasts. So, like last weekend, I'm just going to assume I more than used my Flex Points between those two days. I guess I should try to estimate points better when I'm at parties, but since I have no idea how everything was prepared it doesn't work well. I try to keep in the spirit of the points system by eating more 0-point veggies and less of the desserts at parties than I usd to. I think I'm doing a good job of that.  Now for my next challenge--staying with my parents for two weeks. It is always hard to eat light when they are cooking! I think my secret will be to be very careful with breakfast & lunch to make up for the dinners. Also, I brought my workout videos & I can always go running. So we'll see...

      I started my exercise program at the beginning of June, but I didn't start WW until June 11, so that is going to count as Day 1. Here's a summary of the past few days. I know it looks like I never work out but that is because I'm sick this week. :( I have to get back on track with that!   Day 5 (June 15):  Points: 24 (17 FP left) Workout: none Weight: 145  Day 4 (June 14):  Points: 25 (21 FP left) Workout: none Weight: no weigh in  Day 3 (June 13):  Points: 22 (26 FP left) Workout: none Weight: 144  Day 2 (June 12):  Points: 22 (28 FP left) Workout: none (worked 27 hrs straight--when to workout?) Weight: 146  Day 1 (June 11):  Points: 25 (30 FP left) Workout: Pilates Basic Workout, Jog 30 minutes Weight:148

      So I have decided if I am serious about looking thin on my wedding day and wearing a bikini--for the first time ever--on my honeymoon, I'd better make a plan and keep myself accountable.  So here goes!  Total time: 19 weeks (June 11-Oct 23) Height: 5'3" Starting weight: 148 Starting size: 12 shirts, 10 pants Goal weight: 120 Goal size: 8 shirts, 6 pants  I have lost weight before, but I haven't been under 135 since junior high.  So this will definitely be a challenge. I think the main thing is that I tend to exercise when I want to lose weight but I don't watch what I eat--I love fast food and chocolate! I am going to incorporate both diet and exercise this time:    DIET   I have decided to do Weight Watchers. It really appeals to me because I can eat whatever I want--I do better when I don't feel like I'm depriving myself. I think the way WW focuses on eating anything in moderation promotes a healthy relationship with food, which I need to develop.  I'm too cheap to join the actual program, so I'm using their formula to calculate points on my own. I know from others who do the program that my goal should be 20 points a day, with 35 "Flex points" to use any time during the week. I'll also give myself one extra point for every 10 minutes of cardio I do each day.    EXERCISE   My goal here is not just to lose weight but also to get toned.  My arms, abs, and thighs need some work! I'll be lifting weights 3x/week using the outline in  Buff Brides . For my core, I'll do Winsor Pilates 3x/week. And for cardio, running or TaeBo, 30 minutes 6x/week.

       NEXT GOAL  140 by the end of week 5  CURRENT WEIGHT  ???  I'm finally back from my trip! I'm so glad. I had a good time but two weeks was a long time to be gone. I'm the kind of person who likes routine so it's hard to be on vacation. The good thing about the trip was that I got a ton of wedding planning done. We are going to have so much fun! The food tasted awesome and I am almost done planning all the decorations. I have pictures of my hair trial as well as my dress fittings--will upload them after Kevin teaches me how. That will help to spice up the journal. :)  Anyway, the diet continued to be a disaster over this past weekend. Had family/friends wanting to meet me for lunches & coffee. So I used up a lot of points before dinner, and dinner with the fam is higher cal/higher fat than when I cook for myself. (Not to mention a meal at my favorite hometown mexican place, at which I totally pigged out and loved every second of it!) Luckily starbucks now has those light frappuccinos, so I can go there for just 2.5 points. And I had this horrible flight experience that left me stranded in Chicago, but I resisted temptation to soothe my nerves with greasy food there. So I am making healthier choices than I used to. And I really didn't go over points by that much. I think I'll assume I used all my Flex Points--probably not all in the past three days but definitely if you include my overage from week 4.   I am doing so great with my exercise plan! I can see the difference already!!   EXERCISE:  Day 1 (July 9): 40 minute run + Buff Brides weight workout Day 2 (July 10): 35 minute run + abs workout Day 3 (July 11): none

      Had no internet access for the rest of week 4, so I don't have a full record of what I ate. The summary is that week four was horrible in terms of diet. Between staying with relatives, dinners out, catering tastings and birthday parties, I was over my points every single day. I tried to be reasonable, but I at too much junk!   I worked out a lot, though! Here's the summary:  Day 4 (July 5): 40 minute run Day 5 (July 6): 30 minute run + abs workout Day 6 (July 7): 35 minute run + Buff Brides weight workout  Day 7 (July 8): 35 minute run + abs workout   My goal was to be at 142 by the end of week 4, but since I was out of town I couldn't weigh-in, so the next goal is 140 by the end of week 5.

      Ahh, I had the worst day today! I spent the whole day trying to finish an important project for work, which was really stressing me out. I didn't make the time to workout so I was even more stressed. It was the first time since I started this diet that I found myself eating out of stress. Kinda disappointed in myself, but that's life I guess. Also, blogger was down so I am not sure I'm remembering everything I ate...I think there was even more!
