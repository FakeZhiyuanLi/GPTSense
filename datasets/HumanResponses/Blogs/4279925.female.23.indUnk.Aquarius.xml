						   My last few days in Perth have been a bit of a rollercoaster ride. Not only had I been having some pretty horrible nights sleep, but friends kept on turning up at my door and reminding me why I really wanted to stay in Perth.  So, inbetween bouts of nervousness characterised by the feeling that a giant hand was crushing my stomach, and hyperactivity that made whoever witness them wish I was gone already, I have managed to fit in a few sobs and tears. All round a good last few days.

						   I just wrote my first letter to a member of the aristocracy today. It was such a strange feeling to be writing 'My Lord' instead of 'Dear blah blah'.  Right, so, once The Right Honourable the Viscount Crispin Brentford gets back to me ...

						   I really knew winter was here when I stepped out of the house one day and the ground was covered in frost. Sure, Australia sees frost, so the shimmering swards of grass on Hatfield Mead were not a surprise. What was a surprise however were the frosted sidewalks, which I had to negotiate so very carefully for about 500 meters. Every drop of water on a surface was frozen - I had certainly never seen frosted concrete and tar before. I haven’t seen it since either, so thankfully I have not needed ice-skates to get to the bus again. As I turn out of Hatfield Mead each morning to go to the bus, I look out across Morden Park, and on a clear day it is a sight that never fails to remind me I am in another country. The bare branched trees are many-masted ships ghosting above the mist that obscures their trunks and the grass completely veiled in silver frost. I now understand what crystal-clear air is about ... nothing else really describes the biting crispness of the atmosphere on a cloudless day, you feel as if you could see forever. Overcast days are absolutely no fun, though they are that little bit warmer. Sometimes the sun is even out (gasp!) and there is a wash of orange on the mist and red on the grass so it looks many degrees warmer than it is.   The most entertaining part of the morning for me is my blissful ‘Puff the Magic Dragon' moments. Whenever Perth was cold enough for your breath to steam I would act like a child and pant and huff as much as possible to get a tiny wisp of steam. So naturally, each morning as I mope out the door into the cutting wind and biting air, the only thing that cheers me up is a good, long exhalation so I can stride out in my own personal cloud of steam - guaranteed to brighten anyone’s morning. The only sight that cheers me up more than watching a column of steam rising up from a well peopled bus stop, is the sight of the morning runners, bundled up like eskimos and trailing steam like the Hogwarts Express.

						   The weather forecast for the last week was snow, but frankly I was getting AWFULLY tired of waiting. On Tuesday I was walking down the street to lunch when itsy bitsy little snow flakes starting swirling around me like tiny lost baby hailstones. This lasted for about 30 seconds. Wednesday I entertained a few workmates by standing on the roof and doing a Julie-Andrews-in-the-first-scene-of-the-Sound-of-Music style dance in the 1 minute splatter of snow. Once again, not terribly exciting, but certainly an escalation.  Then, Wednesday afternoon I went up to Old Street to see my house and as I came out of the tube it was snowing. Old Street Station has an open roof to the sky and so I saw the snow falling before I saw it on the ground. Being a snow-virgin there were a few fabulous moments when I didn’t even know it was snow, I seriously looked at the sky and thought ‘that is REALLY fat rain!’ (thank you Terry Pratchett) Walking out onto my very first stretch of snow covered ground I then discovered that the soles on my boots are entirely useless on snow, that a beanie doesn’t protect you from snow in your eyes and that no-one else was grinning quite as broadly as I was at the snow. Once again I should have taken notice.  It was about 20 minutes before rush hour when I got out of the Tube and so, for a short and blissful time, the snow was undisturbed and blanketed the usual London noise until I could almost hear myself jumping around in my head singing ‘It’s snowing it’s snowing hahahaha it sticks to everything my coat is white ah slippery hehehehe it’s snowing it’s snowing it stings when it hits my face I’m not even cold yet it’s snowing it’s snowing whoops.’ The streets were quiet and those who were about were either standing sulkily wishing they had better shoes on or were under 19 years old and had a snowball in either hand.  I headed out to Leytonstone to have a snowball fight with Monica and Matt. The snow was MUCH thicker out in the parks near them and we had a running fight in the street and then ran crazily around in the pristine snow of the parks. It was Matt’s first experience of snow too so the three of us cleared the roof of every car in the street to make arsenals of snowballs and then, once in the parks, made snow angels and found endless amusement in trying to slam each other down in the snow. While Monica and Matt frolicked I was finding new, untouched snow to make footprints in and beaming indiscriminately at snow laden trees feeling too excited to do anything but say ‘this is so cool.’ The best way to describe the feeling was like I had stepped into a film - I knew exactly what snow looked like, but not what it felt like – it was familiar and unfamiliar at the same time.  It was not until I had to walk back to the tube station to go home that I got a hint of what terrible times to come. The snow was incredibly slippery and my boots had no grip so Matt practically carried me to the station. The snow was quickly churned to sludge and the sludge froze overnight so Thursday dawned to find London had turned into a giant ice-rink. Despite the forecasts, many of the councils had not gritted or salted the streets and Thursday was a bit of a farce. The news footage that night was of suited City Bankers measuring their lengths on the sidewalks and well-dressed women in heels hauling themselves off the pavements by clutching at poles and bins. Hilarious footage once I was home and safe. The day was a actually nightmare for me. I am terrified of ice-skating. It usually takes me at least three hours of constant babysitting by patient friends to get me to skate on my own and I never look up at ANY TIME when I am on the ice. So imagine my anxiety as I stepped out Thursday morning to walk the ice. I have never been in such a constant state of terror. I didn’t stack it at all during the walks to work, to lunch and back home - a fact of which I am very proud - but it was mainly because I took TINY steps and I never raised my head. At one stage I do believe I started muttering encouraging remarks to myself under my breath however. I hate ice.

						   See! I have swum in clothes before! It is just I have never done it in four layers on the way to work. Today is the start of the horrible winter weather and I am not in the best mood with London.   ONE – why, why, WHY combine rain AND umbrella melting winds? I had been so proud of the little umbrella I bought from home. It had survived the three times I bought it out so far. On Friday it melted before my eyes in the middle of Hatfield Mead. By melted I mean it buckled and curled along all the ribs, and not even just at the joints. I just walked on watching the death agony of my umbrella and decided that the moment they bring out a titanium brolly, I will queue up for it in fine English tradition.  TWO – surprisingly enough London town planners, drains were invented to keep the water OFF the roads. I walked three blocks today from Tube to work cowering against the far limit of the sidewalk so I could miss the meter high tidal waves churned up by the buses driving through the stream that was the road. Even more entertaining are the small dams that forms on cross walks so that if you DO want dry trousers you have to hike down to the end of the small sea, which is usually a blind corner, to cross the road.  THREE – every time I mutter and grumble my way quietly into work, my London-weary work mates simply smirk and promise me that it gets worse. hahahahahahahahahahahaha*shriek*  And so I end my little rant. I now have only one holy mission. To buy a coat that will render me a walking waterproof area of antipodean London. I am envisioning a Michelin-man effect coat that will cover me from hood to boots in attractive plastic puffa material. Either that or I will abandon myself to long plastic raincoats, Wellington boots and fisherman hats. And then I will move to Cornwall. Yes …  So, put your hands in the air if you are dry only when you are not sweating, and let’s enjoy the pleasures of extreme weather shall we?  Much love (it’s a bit wet, you better put it over the radiator)

						    Quite apart from the fact that this piece is about me and the well documented Look, this is just very funny.  Monica sent it to the usual pub quiz suspects the day after the quiz at which the photo was taken - I don't know if you can see them but I have horns. Monica's headband broke and the first thing everyone thought was 'we can make them into horns for Claire ...'    Why I Am Afraid Of The Claire - by Monica White.   Claire is small, granted. There's a formidable intellect there and a fierce streak. All fine and well, but I'd usually tell someone like that to bite my kneecaps if an argument wasn't going my way.  The Claire, though, has one weapon that chills my blood.  The Look.  This is reserved for those times when words would be utterly superflous. It's usually aimed at me when I say something of a particularly stupid bent. I watch myself around The Claire.  For Claire's calling (not unlike Buffy) is to be an assistant to the supernatural. 'Nothing new,' you may say, 'I've seen her rustle up a group of friends from apparently thin air to make a fab Friday night. I know she's in league with the dark forces.'  Ahh, but this is different.  The Claire is actually PA to Satan himself. She organises his diary. She screens his calls. She gets him hot lava (red with one).  I thought I'd share this with you all. I think it may save one of us someday. Sort of like knowing you're in a bad teen horror flick and following the rules (don't answer the phone, don't wander off by yourself, don't be the stupidest bimbette with the least lines).  Failing that, I think hogwarts.com might have some protection spells.  (Pic of The Look attached for your reference)

						   The biggest exhibit at the Tate Modern Gallery for the last eight months had been the Weather Project, a vast sun made up of powerful lights and an opaque plastice disc setting in a vast turbine hall with a mirrored ceiling. For the last two nights of the exhibition the hall was open until 1am and I joined the crowd on the South Bank at midnight to see a Midnight Sun in wintery London. The Tate is housed in a huge factory and the turbine hall was vast, the mirrored ceiling opened it up even more and the air-conditioning pumped out air carrying dissolved sugar which gave the area a sulphurous glow. Coming out of the freezing night air off the Thames, the heat was incredible and familiar, I was grinning as I crossed the concrete floor to get closer to the much missed warmth. After walking behind the disc to look at the mechanics of the sun I joined the rest of the crowd on the concrete floor – once you had inspected the sun for more than five minutes the urge to watch yourself in the mirrors is overwhelming.  First thing to imagine in this tale is that the mirrors reflected a black and grey world – something in the combination of the huge yellow lights and the air leached all the colour out of the room, leaving everyone's clothes, skin and hair in various shades of grey. Your correspondent was naturally dressed in large amounts of red when she walked in and spent the hour within in shades of deep purple-grey. I think I got a little skittish about this overpowering of my signature shade, which was made even worse when a girl came in wearing a red cardigan of synthetic material that somehow keep it's vibrant colour. The shock of the red colour in the uniform sea of grey was a sight in it's own right.  Once I had protected myself against the concrete floor with my formerly red, now grey, coat and pillowed my head on my formerly rainbow, now grey, scarf I started watching the crowd in the mirrors:  there was a couple synchronising their dance moves  a group doing a Mexican wave  a group in a star shape  a couple doing stylised yoga positions  people having gun fights  people doing the macarena  two boys whizzing around on their backs trying to tackle each other for a backpack (I talked to them for a while and the French one asked me to record in my account that the better looking one – him – won the game)  a solitary man swimming over the concrete, navigating his way through the more energetic groups  a couple doing the 'in a nut shell' mime from Austin Powers but from my position I could only see them reflected around a seam in the mirror that made them a composite of exactly half of each person ...  We were shooed out at 1am and I caught a bus that was going 'close' to Old Street. I got out at Liverpool Street Station and decided to strike out without a map, without directions and without ever seeing that part of London before! It was a lovely balmy night and by this time the streets were thronging with drunken suits escorting tottering miniskirts home. I melded the directions from the maps in the bus shelters with the directions from the driver of a black cab and walked two sides of a triangle that resulted in my doorstep 45 minutes later.

						   The BBC Proms is the biggest musical festival in Britain. It was started by Queen Victoria, and the Last Night at the Proms, broadcast live and screened in parks around London, is an event that allows the British to really display their national pride. I decided to go and see the Lincoln Centre Jazz Orchestra this year, the only non-classical performance in the programme. Four pound standing room only tickets go on sale before the start of the concert and Lizzie and I lined up for three hours for our tickets. Thankfully the night was gorgeous – clear, warm and balmy – perfect conditions for perching on stone steps for hours keeping an eagle eye out for queue jumpers. Even better was that we were right by the huge BMW people mover with tinted windows when it disgorged the orchestra itself - the American jazz musicians alighted, grinned at the crowd, eyed a few girls and sauntered into the Hall. We had lined up for the Gallery, the very top tier of the Royal Albert Hall, and we sat on the floor and peered down through the wrought iron railings into the vast hall below.  The orchestra was pure magic. They had rhythm, they had melody, and what they couldn't do with soul wasn't worth knowing. The air in the Hall was heavy and still with the heat and when you added the sound wriggling it's way into my blood via my ears, my entire body was captured by the music. At some points the beat was so insistent I felt my blood was punching holes through my skin in an attempt to dance unfettered. The leader of the Orchestra was a trumpeter and his skill was undeniable – incredible passages of trumpet solos delivered in double time with a stunning clarity, like having each note dropped as a diamond in your ear. At one point the drummer drove a movement entirely with a tambourine, proving the slightly naff instrument had a range of sound that equalled his drum kit.  Perhaps the most amazing aspect of the performance was the edgy warmth of the methods of making sounds. I got to hear scat singing for the first time which nearly had me forgetting to breathe as I tried to follow the singer’s swoops and loops of sound. The pianist reached into his open piano at one point and stroked his notes out of the piano wires while the double bass player used his wooden instrument as a drum – not the way I would have thought you could use the instrument and therefore all the more entertaining. Some of the musicians had three instruments and swapped with surprising ease from saxophone to clarinet to an unidentifiable-by-your-correspondent instrument variously throughout the song. And finally and very fittingly, the men used themselves and their surroundings to add that extra dimension – trombone and trumpet mutes were slammed repeatedly into the floor as another strong bass beat, the entire orchestra tapped their feet in complicated rhythms as they played and there were even solos when the rest of the orchestra were clapping, stamping and making low calls. Altogether the performance began to take on a personal and embracing feel.  What I loved most was the camaraderie between the musicians themselves and the orchestra with the crowd. As each section or musician played their part the others would turn around to watch and enjoy – bopping their heads or dancing slightly in pleasure. When we came to the second encore only six people came back on stage but they stood together in a tighter group, gathering around each soloist, and the rest sprawled out on the other side of the stage to listen. The crowd itself was a very appreciative one – never stinting on enthusiastic applause for each solo and managing to wring two encores from musicians. The last snatch of the concert was a trumpet solo that made you gasp, and as we raced down the stairs to get the last tube home I felt like I was leaving a jamming session with friends rather than a concert.

						   I was a real groupie the other day, for the first time since I left Perth. I usually prefer to listen to live music cabaret style, with a table of good friends, liquid refreshment and no risk of a head-banging fan landing on my newly polished toenails! (my toe nails are ugly enough as it is). So I am a reluctant gig-goer at the best of times. One thing I do like to do, though, is support the bands that contain people I know and tonight I was finally invited to a friend's brother's gig. Walking into The Standard was like walking into the Grosvenor in the good old days of 2000 – plenty of boys with perfectly messy barnets, plenty of girls in perfect alternative outfits and the smattering of normal people who are usually old chums of or related to the band. I was introduced to Kate's brother - red-headed like his sister, he sported a flawlessly coiffed seventies mullet in deep copper. I was impressed with the grooming. Then I noticed that the crowd had a soothing seventies mullet atmosphere – the fans were sporting the same hairstyle as the band. Very impressive.  Once on stage I have to give The Shots top marks for pure entertainment, repertoire and variety. They were tight, talented and very, very marketable. A few weeks ago, while gate-crashing another event, we got talking to a woman who managed a talent agency for musicians. Matt, Monica and I started picking her brains for the secrets of the pop music industry and one particular part of the conversation intrigued me – commercials. This woman was talking about discovering a track that could be used for commercials because there was big money and a lot of exposure for such a song and it's band. This made a lot of sense to me at the time.  Fast forward again to tonight and The Shots on stage. While a little indulgent with the guitar solos they have all the elements of a band with longevity – toe-tapping 60's style rock homage's, flawless a cappella chorus's, rock stars screams, crisp 1 second silences, strong vocals and a real variety of songs that stood out from each other while forming a rounded set. Kate's brother graduated dux of rock guitar college - while the other guitarists played their guitars, he danced with his guitar, using all the kicks, splits and jumps with a kind of absorbed trance that convinced you his heart was more into the rockier tunes. The other guitarists were a elfin brunet who lurked prettily in the middle of the stage and the other vocalist, a brooding and dark boy with a gorgeous voice for crooning. The four-piece was rounded off with a blond drummer who looked for all the world like he just wanted to surf, dude.  I sat there, my foot twitching during the 60's style tunes (I adore dancing to 60's music) and my head rocking during the rock tunes, thoroughly enjoying myself when they launched into a song that literally screamed out 'this could be a brilliant single' and struck me as a shining example of what the talent scout had described as the song for a commercial. My mind made the connection and suddenly I thought to myself 'wow, I want to buy that car ...' I am not sure The Shots would appreciate being associated forever now with a song that could sell a car but maybe I could persuade them to send it in and they could buy their own car on the proceeds.

						    Since I started travelling, I have begun to treasure the more unusual of Australian national traits, including our unique outlook on defeat. The fact that tens of thousands of young Australians travel to ANZAC Cove each year to commemorate months of slaughter ending in inevitable defeat is indicative of our appreciation for hard work, whether it ends in wealth or death.
