        So I'm surfing the net. And suddenly I say, "Hey, lets go to my blog and update it!" And so I go and what do I see? Or rather, what not? My Tag-Board, yes, the board. Its gone. Now, I laugh to myself and say, "Oh, I'll just get it back." And then I try. And try. And try. And then I realise I cant cuz  BLOGGERS A BLOODY FUCK !      Okay calm now. I'll get Jerry the Board back. (just named it jerry, you didnt miss out)   So I had a pretty boring day. Mainly because it ended at 2pm. Everyone's in school or studying here. Internet is my only friend. Jeez, I sound like a major social outcast there.     Oh god, she's blabbering.    I'm blabbering and talking to myself.   Will go talk on MSN or Friendster now.   Friendster's kinda lame now but thats a whole new topic .     Go.    Aight.Aight. I'm gonna focus on Jerry and his retrieval.

        So I'm so bored yeah? That I thought of 101 things that people might never know about me. Have never been the mysterious type so here goes...     I was born on the most freaking stormy day in the history of Bangladesh. Thus the name Brishty. (Rain, doink!) I moved to Birmingham when I was three. I graduated from St. Benedicts Kindergarten in 1994. I will never go to my primary school alumni thing ever. Those were my shady days where I had no friends and the people were too Singaporean for me. ( No offence though) I can hold a grudge really well. I have stopped talking to people for months at a time.      I easily forgive if someone asks. Kinda weird huh? My favorite shoe brand is Adidas. Although I like slippers best. The worst day in my life will have to be the day my parents 'caught' me and realised the stuff I really do. It isnt so bad but to them it was earth-shattering. I don't like my school, but I am sticking it out as long as I can get into UCL. If I don't get into UCL, I will probably end up at UEA and that will be the end of my uni life. I like celebrating my birthday, because I love the attention. Thats one day you can call your own and its a step closer to that freedom who keep hearing about. My favorite author is Sylvia Plath solely because I have most of her books. I wish I had more time for recreational reading, but school takes up far too much time. I never used to short in my life. I was a tall baby, even back in the dark days. My all time favorite song is Rendenzous by Craig David. My favorite band is Evanescence. I love their music and Amy Lee has an awesome voice. I don't listen to Oasis anymore. It opens up too many wounds. The dumbest thing I have ever done was getting caught up with my social scene that I totally ignored other stuff and soon enough in the end it all came crashing down on me. The smartest thing I ever did was not ot be stupid and mope over it. :) I far prefer Smirnoff to Bacardi. The only time I have ever smoked pot was horrible for me. I have no desire to touch it (pot, not men, J). :) I don't think I have an addictive personality. It's mostly to set an example. I have never stole cigarettes or alchohol and shall never do it due to previous accusations. Tight shirts is the biggest turnoff I can think of. I have issues with telling people how I feel. I usually think they don't care and just let it build inside of me until I pop. I would cry if Charmed, OC, Alias or Gilmore Girls  were cancelled. I have cried in the past month for bad judgement. My duck,Sutha, is my best friend. I was not impressed with the Paris Hilton tape. It looked like she was in Baghdad. Diet Vanilla Pepsi = my drink of choice I collect bags and shoes now that I'm in UK. I can actually get the size. I want a yellow Volkswagon GTI or black Mitsubishi Evo. I have no political affiliation. I vote for whoever I think is less of a dumbass. I cant vote though but always felt that was my only ticket into the political world. My favorite gadget is by far the iPod.  Funny I dont have one. But I played around with Rhea's.  The dumbest thing I ever bought was my first walkman. It broke after a week and I never got it back from repairs. The best concert I ever went to was Evanscence when they came to London. They rocked out. I want to see      Usher      in concert. Most peopleI don't care about enough to fork over the cash. I am very self conscious of my appearance. I have seldom bouts of low self esteem. My main goal in life is to be a lawyer. I have never had serious boyfriends. I don't regret either, because I learned a lot from them. I have never played the lottery. I am too cheap. My biggest vise would be drinking entirely too many cherry cokes and eating too much chocolate. I sure do lead an exciting life. I love flying and hotel rooms.  I am a chicken when it comes to scary movies. Never made through one in the cinema. The first thing i will buy when I graduate from university  will be make a statement that I am not moving back in. I don't think I will ever get married. I don't think anyone would be able to put up with me. I don't know if i even care that much. My favorite holiday used to be Eid. Now it has no meaning, whatsoever. I hate Christmas food. I could not care less about sports. My favorite restaurant is Taco Bell. My least favorite restaurant is New Mumbai Vegetarian Restaurant. When I am really stressed out and just want to clear my head, I cram it with useless stuff. I am terrified of public speaking. I usually do well at it, but before it I am always worried. My favorite time waster is working on this here website. I wish I had more time to do stuff with it that I want to, but I have come to the sad realization that it is a low priority in the scheme of things. I am still amazed that people read this crap I post. I am a major klutz. I feel      Sean Combs       model shouldnt be so haaawwwt. I like to listen music all the time.I can't stand staying in silence.. I hate chatting on the net. I hate it cuz people dont get you're being sarcastic(which 95% of the time I am).I have started to become more straighforward now. I am very shy when I first meet someone, but usually open up once I get to know them more. I have lived in at least 12 houses. Maybe more. I lost count. I have got a cast iron stomach. i am all about Pier 1 candles. They make my room smell nice. :) From the looks of me you'll think I'm quite messy. I have an impressive collection of makeup. I've stopped cuz I'm poor.  I don't like my financial state. I think Singapore is the best place for me. The thing i am most proud of is saving the cash up to buy my phone. It was one of the first big time goals I set and reached. I would prefer being really cold than hot. I want to go to a sushi buffet one day. I have trust issues with people. I trust absolutely no one. I have been burnt too many times. I consider very few people friends. I have acquaintances, but very few friends. I set my standards really high in that category. I trust friends. The best year of my life 2nd and 3rd year of secondary school. This year is the worst of my life. I spend entirely too much time messing around on the net. Evianis the best bottled water. I used to have nice hair. I am somewhat of a snob. I don't really care though. I am somewhat anti boredom. Cant stand just sitting down and doing nothing. I have no problem admitting that I am wrong. I am rarely wrong though in my opinion. ;) I loathe the current situation in my life. I used to have hair down to my shoulders. It was good. I haven't thrown up in  6 months. The worst experience of my life was getting my chin stiched back together. That hurt like hell. I dont think I can ever drive I drink 4 litres of water almost every day. I cant cook. I have days where I just sit at my computer and lose track of time. The most boring 4 hours of my life is the drive from Norwich to Brighton. The scenery is so drab. I wish I had more time to devote to my art. I am a sucker for depressing music. I don't like moving. You just have to do everything all over again. Much like when you delete an important file and  you have to retype it. I try to get my hair cut every 6 months and its not even planned. (till now) My biggest fear is that I am going to fail at life once I graduate. I have transferred between way too many schools. I have spent entirely too much time compiling this list. I don't like being like everyone else.

        Does anyone know how much I hate my thyroid deficiency? Yesterday went out with A, A's brother and A's oh-so-ugly cousin. Every thing was fine. Or as fine as it gets when you've got parents like ours. Anyways, got home and found my mum very very sick. Apparently she did bad in her medical exams and so she had instant fever. So yeah. Had to stay at home for some reason because she was sick although didnt do anything except for furiously type. Another time then, S.Today am supposed to go out but my hair's stupid and am severely poor.  When shall this poordom pass?

Do  I  ever shut anyone up when they call me at 2 in the morning because they  felt  their loser boyfriend might be cheating on them? No. But when once me, I call someone at night I hear shit for it. This is for  you know who . Fuck off.  Ahem. Now that thats outta my system I can go back to doing nothing.

       I just read an article about how friendster is 'cliquey' and 'just like real-life'. I dont know. Just dont see it. Go read   urlLink  it    .    Had my hair-cut. (!)      No, not by myself. This time I actually went to a proper salon and proper salon people cut it. I think it looks great. My mum hates it so I figure it is great.Have absolutely no plans for tomorrow. Might head out to swim tomorrow. Yes, people I swim. Had some fantastic pictures taken by sham that day. Thought might add to to my Friendster but felt that would be too obnoxious.  Annoying Boy keeps calling and texting me. Dont know whether "correcting my bitchyness" was a good plan afterall.Till tommorow.

        Five minutes ago, I woke up to the very clear realization that I really hate the word "tidbit".    It sounds like cat food.

        - friendship books?    - "Other Voices"?    - penpals?- Heather/Faith?    - "The Morri'zine"?    - Penguin Productions address labels?    - glitter and packing tape?    - mail art?    - craft boxes?    - hanging posters on the ceiling?    - stamps?    - Priscilla Pamela Panchagayam?    5 years ago, these were the most important things in my life. I miss them all so much. Would anyone say I'm on vacation? This has been the far-out most boring trip ever. And I thought it would be so meaningful since it's the last time I'll be here for the next 5 years at least. But no. Zilch. Nada

        So you lie down with so much hope, thinking that this is the night when you're going to get enough sleep. You think that the next morning will be when you start on the road to good health, rested and fresh. It's early, and you're sleepy. You think you can put your head down and be out, dreaming, floating. Your body will do the things it needs to do to function right. You'll be aces in the morning!  But what's this, now.  The pillow doesn't feel right. Your neck hurts, it's not the right thickness and your spine feels all strange. You can't remember how it is you've been sleeping for the last three decades -- on your back? side? stomach? How come every position feels wrong? There's not enough blanket. The sheets are tucked in at the foot of the bed, so you can't move right. How can you sleep on your side if you have two arms? Where in Hell do you put that other arm? Your circulation feels off. Are you breathing right? Listen to the speed of your inhaling and exhaling. Does it match your bedmate's? Why has this supposedly involuntary act suddenly become a skilled task of precise timing? Why isn't your jaw sitting right? How should your teeth be aligned while you sleep? Mouth open? And your eyes -- where do they go when you sleep, do they roll back into your head? Are they rolling back right now? The things you see moving around in the dark, are they inside your eyelids or inside your skull? Or are they actually in your eyes?  The mobile. You&nbsp;put it to charge&nbsp;it but you didn't&nbsp;turn the switch on. Or did you? And what about the&nbsp;hidden fags, did you forget to hide it after the secret smoke, or is it safely tucked in the crack of your closet? Is the closet door open? Is the&nbsp;bedroom door locked? Did you set the alarm clock? Oh god, the clock, it's been a full hour since you got into bed, it's already tomorrow and you swore that wouldn't happen, you need to sleep! But the pillow feels strange, and can't stop thinking about how you're going to hit the snooze alarm again and again, and all you want is to sleep sleep sleep but it's really all a waste of time, lying here and worrying and looking at the clock. You could just get up and get some work done. How come you can fall asleep in English class, but not in bed?  Please, let sleep come and stop looking at the clock, put black tape over it and spin around until you're dizzy and sick and wobble onto the bed and fall...

       Had a tiring day today. Lotsa walking. I think B is getting more and more irritating now. So I'm just sitting and not caring about her.     Everyone's sleeping now. House is real quiet. Except my new Vintage Slow Rock Vol. III (!)    But its on real soft so the house is really mellow now.    I dont care for sleeping. I think it's a waste of time especially if you are somewhere where you're likely never to come again. Like now, here.   Hmpf. Jerry's still lost. But all Tag-Boards are down.   Hello, Shakil. (mentioned)   Gilmore Girls on in 1 hour.
