      Tomorrow I get to take French II, Ap English, and a wellness final. Isnt life swell? It just kina sucks they have to cram it all into one day, and the last one at that. But I'm not studying so lets hope things work out for the best. Smooth move, I know.  I can't see Shattered Existence @ ALrosa Villa on the 4th because of gay las vegas. GRR sorry Matt :( I hope I dont miss a lot of things over that week period. I bet I do just because thats how things usually work out.   And I think I am going to see  The Day After Tomorrow  tomorrow. Tricky huh?

      The crazy black lady won with the duck voice! Yeah, the saga is finally over. Sadly, none of them could sing.  Fantasia was her name I do believe :)

      today is wellness we had to do this retarded CPR thing. Yes! I love basically making out with dusty dolls that sit in Conley's office and pretty much every kid in school had their mouth on it. Yum Yum. Ours was broken and the air wouldn't pump in the stomach so yeah, it was pointless. I would never save someones life. I would probably waste time  trying  to save them and they would just die anyways. Then it would be my fault.  I also went with CeCe to Don Pablos and to get my cool sun glasses. and yes, I do look like a 70s rock star in them.

      Josh got his braces today.  Since I'm not hanging out with Sam after school today after all, I was home flipping through the channels and decided to watch TRL. Usually, I hate this show but I'm in an odd mood today. Avril Lavigne was on and I swear if she wasn't stoned she is mentally retarded. She can't pull together logical sentences and went through the whole "I'm not punk!" sincero once more. I'm getting sick of hearing out it. Most people who claim to be punk now-a-days aren't. Most people have never even heard true punk music. Screw Stevie and her GC obsession. Thats plain retarded. But, people like what they like, more power to ya.  I'm also painting this kinda nifty painting on a canvas for art but since we only have 3 days left I am bringing it home so I can actually get it done in time.

       MY WEEKEND   Friday I woke up around 2am from a dream I was going to die in a tornado. Friday before I went to hang out with some friends, almost the entire state of Ohio had tornado warnings. A sign? maybe. I recovered with satisfaction however when Josh was freaking out and begging me to go to the basement. Oh how my joy I had when making fun of him an hour later.  At Watty it was some mediocore fun.Fun Parts: dancing behind the old people as they looked @ old photos without them knowing, Cindy and I getting scolding by an old ladie who decided to come on the dance floor and teach us "the shake" since today's kids can't dance, Matrix moves on the stairs, dropping my icecream being retarded, Double S and staring @ Oshie (I dont care what Sarah or her clan says, that kid is unbelievable attractive and talented), and 2 songs by NU.  un-fun parts: Cess kinda ditching us once) for Joe*2nd) for nate*3rd) have no idea, all of the lame coverbands, being really hot,and stupid fag who made NU quit playing because it was 11:01pm.  I blame coverbands. If you want to listen to a band, pop in their cd. Don't try to be the band.  Saturday I hung out with my mom suprisingly enough. She wasnt all that bad for once. Her and John are having some issues I guess. I give them a month, tops. She bought be some wine coolers (why? I have no idea) then later I see Gaylan, Devon, Jeremy, and Steve all pass in their car. They stop, we talk, we go back to Colins. Jeremy and Steve leave and come back with an nice amount of alcohol. I have to be home in an hour but I go for it anyways. bottom line: we all had some fun and I was home in time. SCORE for me.  Sunday family came over, enough said. I give the weekend and overall 8 :)

      Lets just say...  5th grade band: performance was the best 34 seconds of my life.  Jr-High: Who knew "Roxy" rocked that much??? High-school: Pirates of the Carribean, 5 thumbs up.  Cindy is by far the coolest 8th grader alive. Props to her. We had a nice time critisizing tha fat ladies and the guy with his panties showing in front of us. Then we shot over to DQ and guess who pulls up? My freaking parents getting hotdogs. What a coincidence... I love the way they spy on me, its so suddle.  I am going to miss Scott's party tomorrow to see that show so it better be good. I will be very disappointed if it isnt. Samantha is ditching me too... that little whore :)

      last night I watched the Real World, and yes I have seen every episode :)I hate that supid Robin girl! grr she sucks. Randy has to be the coolest but yeah, anyways...  I need to get my gay french grade up. "Madame" Taylor lectured me for having a B rarr. Oh and Sarah is being a butthead. Seriously, every time I go to talk to her she is EXTREMELY pessimistic and not just in a nonchalant way. Nothing is good what-so-ever. I am a little worried about what some of those guys are going to "experiment" with this Saturday. I of course turned the chance to go down. Fuck that lame shit. Some stuff doensnt bug me much but I'm thinkin I am gonna hafta draw the line here.   Poor Ryan, he likes Sarah but I know she isnt into it anymore. She was last week but she is crazy like that. I can tell things are gonna get messy and I get to console some feeling, which is what I always do.   Samantha might go with me this Friday too. So I have some options :) I know I am going to watterson though. Oh and Sarah tells me Tucker is a little mad about Cecily hangin with Joe so much. I am smelling another mess come on...  My job is never done. Oh joy.

      Since I am ALWAYS on the computer and I am over-opinionated, I thought one of these would work out great for me. We have nine days of school and I am stoked... but then Kathy and dad or going to Las Vegas for a week so I cant do anything my first week out. grr. School moves slower every day though, I think I am about to shoot myself in the face. Cindy is kinda mad at me too since I got the TBS autographs last Friday :). That was a GREAT show. Taking BAck Sunday... definitely a top 5 band. Then again, that number changes often. Music is the bestest thing ever, dont let anyone ever tell you different. I dont think I am going to let people see this site. It could be my personal little naughty place. haha, with the exception of the naughty part.         Yeah so this weekend... What am I gonna do?? Cecily wants me to go to Watterson with her but Midgard sounds like way more fun. Lets make a list of positives and negatives.  Watterson  (+) its outside, New Union's new stuff makes me wanna cry its so good, Veritas is possibly playing, and I get to see Double S and drool @ Oshie. GOD that kid is a milf if I ever saw one.  Midgard  it's closing down and its one of the last shows, I get to meet/hang out with the Rob kid I talk to on the internet from TVP, Driving in Silence look like a GREAT band, I might get to go with Ryan, his friend, and Sarah. Its still a coin toss. I dont really feel like being a 3rd wheel at Watterson with Cess and Joe but they are playing better bands that I know. Yeah I have no clue but I still have an ass load of homework to do...  .:c*ya:.

      I just read that last blog. haha Where the hell did that come from? It was a bit strange.  I am currently OBSESSED with this xanga site. I started a journal on there but I guess I can still write in this one too. That was is just kinda cool with the links and junk. People read my other one though. haha I'm not sure why I keep this one personal but I do. I dont really write "secret" things in here haha. Well I mean some stuff I wouldnt want people to see like that last entry. I dont even know what the fuck that was. Kyle reads it and asks me about it. That would be odd. I DONT LIKE THAT KID I swear. By  Like  I mean have any feeling of any type grr...  I feel so odd lately. bleeh.

      Its maybe 4 in the morning and I can't sleep. I went to bed at around 2 but I just laid there. I had a conversation with Travis tonight about everyone in Belle Center and how everything is so different. How Kyle, Kathrene, and I were  always  together. How Kyle and I just acted like brother and sister and everyone thought differently. How our entire relationship was crazy and basically a waste of time on my part. Why did I even go there with it? I knew it wouldn't be right. I knew that I was just doing it to make him happy. By "it" I mean date, not anything else. We were never bored because we were always together. I secretly despised Kat most of the time. She was exactly what I hated in a person. She lied constantly to me to make herself sound better and I knew it everytime. She was loud, she was peppy, she was  extremely  materialistic. I knew I only hung with her so that it wouldnt be awkward between Kyle and I when we were just friends. Travis told me how different he was now and how Kathrene moved. She fuckin moved and I didnt even know it. Kyle was dating a new girl and I didnt have a clue. Why cant I keep in touch with people who meant so much to me just a year ago? They were my life. Why is it bugging me so much now? I havent even seen them since x-mas. I hope mom lets me go stay up there for a weekend. I'm skeptical of seeing Jordy. I use to be so obsessed with that kid. The hugest crush ever and he didnt even really notice me. Then, once I'm about to move, he sees me. Which is of course my shitty luck. Dad lives too far away to just casually take me to visit. The truth is, I dont know if I even want him now. I know I will when I get there and hang out with him though. haha, I use to obsess over watchin him board. Jolissa was so sick of hearing about it too. Jordy and Jo didnt get along but I didnt really care. He called me before I went to my grandparent's but I was in a rush so I kinda blew him off. Idk, I just miss that place so much. I just need to go back and see that its not what I keep thinking. Mom shouldn't have made me leave without saying bye. I guess I just need closure which sounds cliche but it's true. I feel a lot better now but I'm not tired and there is no one on aim to talk to. There is a lot more on my mind but I dont feel like typing anymore so I'm gonna go be lazy again.

      Tina/Jordan update:  Shannon found the panties! haha. When Jordan went to work Tina went over to his apartment and his gf left a note on top of them on the bed stating "whos are these?". Ok this girl is retarded. Who would just leave a note saying that? I would have plenty more to say and I surely wouldnt write it on a note. But, its her game, not mine. It's a fun situation.  I am finally home and glad. I also went shopping today with good ol' weenie for last time for awhile. I got some jeans and 2 t-shirts. Oh and these cool rings but Josh stole the neon orange one already. That little panzie.  Last night: Tina bought the booze. We had a great time. But what happens in Lexington, stays in Lexington. haha it was very needed, bottom line.

      Today I was in a bad mood for about 20 minutes. Then I grabbed a shower and I was really hypre afterwards. Its true, showers are magical haha. I think I mighta felt like crap because i didnt shower after I woke up, I actually got dressed and returned to grandmas. Plus, Ivy is killing me. honestly, I really really need a break so I stayed here tonight instead of Tina's.  I know I am missing action though. haha Tina planted a thong in Jordan's apartment and his girlfriend was coming over. He deserves it, he freakin sleeps with Tina like 5 nights a week and his little high school gf doesnt know. I hope she sees them. Tina said she put them on her side of the bed right on the floor. ha, this is gonna be funny. Poor guy.  I'm glad I get to go home Saturday though. All I have to do here is listen to music and the computer basically, so I have been on tons lately.

      There is a bird that wont leave me alone. I'm at Tina's and the freakin thing will not leave my head. I think its nesting in my curls haha. I hate this bird. I think i am gonna open the window.  I remember I had something I wanted to write about 10 minutes ago and now its gone.  Oh well. I just got done talking to David, I think of all people... he confuses me most. I dont know if hes a skitzo, or just mentally incapable of keeping one mood. He is crazy. And now I am baffled by our conversation. grr...  I dont know, I kinda feel like crap right now for some reason.

      lets see... today:  woke up early for once (10am!) and got a quick shower to run to town with Kimberly. SHe had a doctors appointment and I took my book with me which was good since we were there an hour and a 1/2. It was pretty gay but I was occupied. For the record, I never read so be proud of me u little journal. Its a 300 pager and I am almost done on me first day, so yeah. It's a good one. I will fill ya in when I finish.  Later I went to Mt. Vernon to look for a huge ass picture frame for Kim, unsuccessfully. Then grams made me rice and broccoli bake :) god she is the best cook ever.  I watched the 2nd half of Real World too. Helllooo Charlie. He plays the guitar. very nice. Talented people, grr. Thats hott. (that was a good grr by the way)  http://www.purevolume.com/anberlin  Rob introduced me. they are rather different but in a good way. Listen up kiddies

      hello again. I was so excited when I was reading Rolling Stone the other day. It was recapping 50 of rocks events that changed American music history. It had great stories of the Ramones, the Clash, and some on Johnny Rotten and Sid Vicious. I was so happy, dont ask why. I just found greatness in this.  I also got a new cd today. Dead poetic, I am on the last song now. I give it an A+, its great. But the batteries are almost dead to my cd player and the poor thing has been freakin beaten to death. Chris carved his name in the front, it has a "Im gay" sticker on the front, it has scratches everywhere, and the back battery cover fell off. I think I'm going to get a new one before vacation because I plan to listen to it a lot over that week period. Ivy has dropped it aleast 10 times  TODAY .  I'm staying at grandmas today and taking a break from running around. It's driving me mad. I need to calm down because I sleep to late everyday and then I am just always tired. Plus I have been getting bad ass headaches. But... I'm off for now, I'm not feeling to hot.  .:cya:.

      gasp! Yes it is true, an entire large pizza for 5 dollars. I was shocked too.   Last night I finally got to Mansfield and stayed with Tina. It was fun but I had to get up early because of Ivy. We went to some bird conservatory place, I'm not sure what it was. It just had all of these exotic birds, not too fun. THEN we got icecream but the icecream lady with hairy arms made it very poorly and it fell on the ground 3 seconds after handing it to me. Some say it was my fault, others side with me. Lets just say this drama was settled when I decided to just eat what was left.   I'm staying with grams tonight to get a break from Ivy. I'm not sure what is on the agenda tomorrow.  The only down thing I have to talk about is my back hurting. Josh isn't here to crack it for me. That may sound odd but he cracks it for me everyday since I have a painful grandpa back. Oh, and in the car grandma plays terrible terrible music. Not anything like country, it's like cheesy love music you here on random pornos and commercials. I know that is a bad desciption but its all I have. All I know is that I turn it down and try to talk to drown out the awkward tunes. I need to just take an hour out of my day tomorrow to calm down with my cd player. This lack of music is driving me insane. If that sounds gay then I am as gay as they come because I can't last days on end with my music. I need to go get some new cds though, I have like 80 bucks with me so I will just have grams (haha grams) drop me off to grab a couple. New Cds are the best :)  they always make me excited.  Kathy called me today.... They are officially in Nevada. good for them.

      hellooo. So here is the scenario: Dad jacked up the phone line somehow in the yard so I haven't had computer for about 4 days. I had a phone because of the cell but yes, the computer is my routine. I thought I was going to kill/hurt something or someone. I planned to hospitalize Josh but unfortunately he was camping. Now, everything is back to normal, except the fact that I am leaving tomorrow for a week. Let's recap shall we?  Friday:  I got out of school and I wasn't sad. Usually I am excited but sad in the back of my mind since I barely see the clan during summer until hardcore fair where its party 24-7 but I just didn't freakin care. I went to the movies and saw that Day After Tomorrow movie and it was terrible. That movie is gonna make tons but have tons of disappointed viewers too. Then a couple people came and stayed @ my place.  Saturday : sucked. kathy and I ran around Dublin trying to find a good shock collar fence for the dog and ended up finding one in Marysville. Then I went to Marilyn's party but came kinda late into it and it ended like an 1h30 later. I met TONS of cool new kids though. I honestly never knew there were that many around here so I am glad I have some new buds. Any days after Saturday leading to now I have done seriously nothing. People come over and say hey to me for maybe and hour and thats the most I have associated with the outside world. Kathy is pissing me off! GRRR I swear I will shoot myself in the face next time she tells me I cant ride with someone. Im not going to get in the car with a drunk kid or even a kid who sucks at driving. Everytime I ride with a kid I always put my seat belt on but NO thats not fucking good enough. I swear to god she makes everything into a big deal. She has to ask me every question before I go somewhere "whos driving", "what time u gonna be home", "I need to talk to their parents", "dont be leaving in cars with people". It sounds as if I am an ex-con and I have never been caught for anything bad. EVER.   I dont know, I wish she would lighten up. Last week, Devon called me and 20 minutes after we hung-up.... "whos this boy calling you??" Its Devon! Jesus has she met the kid? He is like my giant brother. He called about double dating with him and Gaylan. I'm not sure I wanna do that. Gaylan graduated and was in my art class and we barely talked. He kinda flirted with me some but I just wasnt really into it. I probably will end up doing it since I havent gone on a date in quite a while. I can thank Lauren for pointing that one out. She made me think of that and I really wasnt concerned before and now I am just worried. lol Am I going to die alone?? haha, yes I should be worried...Im not even 16 yet. SOON I will be, soon.  Ok yes, I feel much better :)   Don't worry, I will be hanging with some people tomorrow and can get out my lonliness.
