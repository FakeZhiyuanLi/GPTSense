      File Under: Reconnaissance  Today we went to the  urlLink SF Int'l's  press conference. The announcer screwed up the ED's name. It was a little embarrassing. Funnily enough, my co-worker told me that the ED is infamous for misaproprisms - and sure enough she mangled eclectic - giving it just a few more consonants than it was used to. [It came out sounding like ekta-lech-tic.]  Their program looks really good. Including a film called VIBRATOR which we tried to get for the SFIAAFF.

      File Under: Film Festival  Our  urlLink  festival  just ended. And with the week break between the San Francisco and San Jose portions it seemed so anticlimactic  to do that small portion before calling it a day.    I already had my downtime. My weeping for the physical toll of the intense schedule. Buying groceries and renting videos so I wouldn't have to deal with people for awhile.   Now we're here again. It feels very discombobulating.   Both portions screened IMELDA on its last day. A fitting end, a fallen hero(ine).

       File Under: Synopsis & Review   Tsai Ming-liang directs this story about the death of cinema. Slow-paced and lushly filmed, the story follows the inhabitants of a movie theatre on the last night before the closure of a Taipei movie theatre.  As a young man sits in the theatre he notices that two older men sitting in the audience are the same men who are on the screen in Dragon Gate Inn. Two co-workers try to make a connection, a young loud chomping girl taunts a man as she watches the movie. Moments like these are layered as past, present, and future interact in this romantic eulogy for a dying era.  Sometimes  urlLink Roger Garcia  just gets it so right. Come prepared for the pace of slow mourning.

       File Under: Synopsis & Review   On Sunday, 18 April a bunch of the NAATA staff went to see the  urlLink Metallica  documentary:  urlLink Some Kind of Monster.  It was pretty good. If you're a music fan or doc. fan you can find something compelling here.  The doc. follows the band as they gear up to record  urlLink St. Anger  (2004). After 22 years, the band is in serious need of some overhaul and therapy. They hire a therapist, a type of "life coach" to help them deal with each other as they record the album. The film is at turns funny, frustrating, and almost but not-quite heart wrenching.   In the same way that Bernard Sumner came out looking good in  urlLink 24 Hour Party People  - Kirk Hammett comes out looking the best in Some Kind of Monster. He doesn't seem as self-focused as Ulrich or Hetfield and when no one is talking to each other they are still talking to Hammett.  The piece will get wide release in San Francisco in July 2004, so check it out then.

       File Under: Reconnaissance   Last night we all went to the  urlLink SFIFF  Opening Night screening and party.   The movie was Jim Jarmusch's  urlLink Coffee and Cigarettes  - an exceptional movie that showed the awkwardness of interacting individuals as they struggled to find these commonalities - usually finding it in sharing these two (little) vices.   It was weird to assess what the SFIFF did vs. what we did at the SFIAAFF. I had never looked at a film festival with such a critical eye - "Oh look they give away bottles of SKYY vodka in giftbags." (Not worrying about possibly contributing to the delinquency of minors.)  Our job that evening (everytime we go to a Film Festival) was to try to see how we could improve the SFIAAFF. We also schmoozed a bit with fellow industry people and a little bit more with those who were affiliated with the SFIAAFF in some way shape or form. Ah, congregation at these events!  Generally a good time was had by all. [Really - I took a poll.:-)]

      File Under: Miscellaneous  Last night NAATA had a preview screening of  urlLink ZATOICHI: The Blind Swordsman  --- a new movie by Takeshi (Beat) Kitano.   A preview screening is a great way for Festival (and  urlLink NAATA ) to engage the public in a way that doesn't involve us asking for financial support. A screening brings together the members, the donors, the volunteers, the friends, and the staff for an evening of cinematic entertainment. The audience is united in its support of NAATA and the SFIAAFF and through attending the event are given a nugget of exclusivity.   "Be the first one on your block to watch ZATOICHI!"  The evening is beneficial situation for all involved. Audience members are given a free, exclusive preview, NAATA is given an opportunity to support Asian Film and reward supporters, and the film studio (in this case,  urlLink Miramax ) is given a marketing opportunity with a highly targeted demographic, thus increasing their chances of a "word-of-mouth" marketing campaign.

      File Under: Synopsis and Review  Sometimes a movie is so bad it is funny. Not a funny to everybody movie, but a post ironic - "ha-ha! can you believe they poured money into this?" type of thing. To me that is what  urlLink THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW  was all about. It put me in a really good mood, as disaster movies normally do. (Am I right here?)  On the representin' front, Tamlyn Tomita does a good job as Janet Tokada, Jim Hamaguchi as Taka and Russell Yuen as Hideki, the Japanese Astronaut, Nobuya Shimamoto as the Japanese Policeman, Bunrey Miyake as the Japanese Shop Owner, Alvin Tam as Japanese Reporter, Mikio Owaki as the Noodle Chef, Rob Fuguzaki as the National Newscaster, Leyna Nguyen as Misc. Newscaster #1, Lina Patel as Misc. Newscaster #2 - there were perhaps more that I didn't catch.  Hopefully we're getting to a place in media where it is a no-brainer that Asian Americans will be cast in roles (both starring and supporting) in which ethnic identity doesn't play a factor.

      File Under: Reconnaissance  Yesterday the Festival Department went to the Press Conference for the  urlLink 28th San Francisco International Lesbian & Gay Film Festival . Frameline is our neighbor at the 9th street Independent Media Center, we cheer them on and they do the same for us. Their program is impressive starting with the Opening Night feature  urlLink TOUCH OF PINK  and closing with  urlLink D.E.B.S. . After the announcements by Michael Lumpkin (Festival Co-Director) and Jennifer Morris (Festival Co-Director) TOCUH OF PINK was screened.  The casting of Kyle MacLachlan as the Cary Grant imaginary confidant was truly inspired. One scene that had MacLachlan in full safari gear straddling an ice sculpture was just hilarity inducing. The story follows Alim (Jimi Mistry) as he deals with coming out to his mother and what that means to his relationship with his British boyfriend. The movie will make a great Opening Night, heading the schedule for a gripping festival that wil touch on both light and hard issues facing the community, such as marriage rights and a gay slasher film.  Check out the schedule if you get a chance, Frameline does an awesome job of putting on a great Festival year after year.

       File Under: Film Festival Planning   I'm at that point of the Film Festival cycle when reporting to sponsors and foundations (government and private) are what preoccupies my time. There are two pieces to this project that make it excruciating; the first is double checking payments received and getting those who haven't paid to "pay up;" the second being actual grant reporting to justify monies received. I will elaborate more on the latter now.  Grantwriting can, arguably, be an art. You write what exciting programs you have in mind if only you could get the money to fund it.   The best grants are realistic, imaginative and contain an arc - just like a story, your project/program/non-profit is the protagonist. You give reasons why your story makes sense and (if you're good) you let them know how you can prove it to them that you've done (or attempted to do) everything you say you will. All the while allowing for the possibility that an unexpected outcome may happen, but you'll judge what happens by this specified criteria so everyone can see how the results may come to pass.  The most important thing to do when you write all this is that you follow through with the measures you describe to judge the efficacy of the project/program/non-profit. You'll save yourself time and hair-pulling if you have these measures built into the program themselves (e.g. questionnaires as part of a panel discussion). Then when the time comes you can compute the data from the questionnaires put it in the context of the original grant and send it off to the foundation.   And if you don't have technology issues like we do at NAATA (OS 9.2 for chrissakes!) then the process is rather smooth. Taking into account that you're a good writer, that you aren't burnt out, etc... but I digress.  Happy reporting!

       File Under: Synopsis & Review   A quiet Korean and German movie that tells the fable of life and the burdens we carry with us. The movie takes place on a small floating monastery, a monk lives with a young boy (probably about 5 years old). The monk is his master out to teach the boy how to find tranquility and live a similiar life of Zen peacefulness. In the first vignette of Spring, the boy is chastised for his treatment of small creatures. It is so beautifully simple that it seems to be beamed right out of a koan. Things change in Summer, as the boy is shown to be approximately of teen age. A sickly young girl comes to live with them on the monastic boathouse and (of course) an affair between the two youths blooms.   The film is told with very little dialogue and extremely lush scenes of the area that the monastic boathouse exits in.  The fable of the story is the fragility of life and the burdens we carry. There is an extremely strong metaphor about doors and the use and placement of doors. The  kanji  for "shut" as in "shut the door" is also fraught with meaning. Kim Ki-Duk did an excellent job of carving out the simple beauty without words.

       File Under: Synopsis & Review   Morgan Spurlock chose to make himself a guinea pig for the sake of a documentary. For 30 days he had the sedentary lifestyle of an average American and he ate at McDonalds every day for 30 days. He would not eat it if it wasn't on the McDonalds menu.  So what happened?  Kidney problems, impotence, depression, and addiction to the food.  Some strange stuff. A really good examination of the Fastfood Industry a la Michael Moore-style. It makes one question what they're putting into their body. The film has been hitting the Film Festival circuit. Both screenings sold-out at the  urlLink SFIFF , so San Franciscans have been chomping at the bit (pardon the very deliberate pun) to see it.

       File Under: Film Festival Planning   The last two work days, May 6 and 7 respectively was spent at a house in the Upper Haight district of San Francisco.  The four of us, what I like to call the "core four" or "core of four" sat down and hashed out on Day 1 what went right and wrong with the 2004 SFIAAFF. Then on Day 2 by hashed out what we wanted for the 2005 SFIAAFF.  So what went wrong?  personnel issues (which lead to a whole host of issues)  lack of planning  lack of team cohesiveness   What went right? Basically what made us look professional to the outside.   fundraising  ticket sales  outreach  programming  guest services   It was cathartic and exhausting to try to shape a common vision. I realized that we may all be working very hard towards a vision of the SFIAAFF, but that we may be working at cross purposes if that vision is not the same vision. After the retreat, I'm not sure we all have the same vision. But we are getting closer.

       File Under: Reconnaissance   A free ticket on SWA and I was off to Los Angeles to see how the crew at  urlLink Visual Comunications  put on an Asian American Film Festival. They turned 20 this year.   Opening Night Film was  urlLink Wayne Wang's  Chan is Missing. An engaging tale of two cab drivers and their search for their friend Chan. Shot cinema verite style by Mchael Chin (with sound by Curtis Choy) the gritty camera work perfectly compliments the pair as they banter througout the film in their quest for not only Where Chan is, but Who Chan is. Therefore asking in a wider context about the Asian American experience (embodied by Chan) and his environs.  The Festival itself - it's hard not to do a side-by-side comparison of our differences - the biggest difference being only geography. [VC and NAATA are aligned in mission statements.] A point-by-point rundown would do both NAATA and VC a disservice.   An enviable thing they do have is much more Hollywood-style star power: James Hong, John Cho and from  urlLink Big Fish  Ada and Arlene Tai. This was in addition to the usual cast of characters, including the SDAFF crew and Director Im Sang-soo.  Being the starf*cker that I am this lent a shiny glint to the evening of good conversation, tapioca drinks and sumptious desserts.

      File Under: Miscellaneous  Our friends over at  urlLink Dealership  (who kindly played Directions in Sound at the  urlLink 2004 SFIAAFF ) were recently in Los Angeles filming a video for a single off their soon-to-be released new album ACTION ADVENTURE.   urlLink Photos from the set  reveal a green screen, martial arts moves, and doubles! Wow!  Hmm, I wonder if the video will be done in time for the 2005 SFIAAFF Music Video program...

      File Under: Film Fesival Planning  For the past few weeks Khristine and I have been scouting venues for the  urlLink 2005 SFIAAFF  Closing Night. We're looking for a different place than the War Memorial Green Room where we've had it in years past.   At this point we've hit most of the venues that are within our price range that hit the criteria:    Wheelchair accessible   Parking available nearby   Pretty architecture   Pretty inside   Centrally located   Stage in main room   Independent catering and alcohol - okay    So now we're thinking of alternative spaces. We've thought of large galleries (perhaps) and now we're thinking of different types of alternative spaces. We're getting wild here, we're thinking in dotcom terms.   That is - remember when dotcom parties were every and anywhere? [I remember an airplane hangar on Treasure Island, some retail stores, and more clubs than I can count.] That's what I'm thinking of.   So, if anyone remembers a cool (and affordable or sponsorship-related-able) place I'm up for any and all suggestions,  urlLink e-mail me  yo!

      It's 6:25pm and I'm sitting in the practically empty theatre.  There's maybe 20 of us in total in the audience.  We're waiting to see the film "The Road Taken."  I wonder if it's because of the subject matter that doesn't attract crowds?  Since there is such a small audience, the person collecting surveys for the drawing is forced to talk to people indivdually who can't seem to figure out..what a survey is. Questions like, what's the survey for?  What do I need to fill it out?  Do I have to fill it out? Are called out randomly.  I roll my eyes annoyed.  If you were a regular festival goer, you would know that it's in your best interest to fill out the very short survey to be entered into the drawing.    I started to feel like I was back in high school and these audience members were whining kids who didn't want to do their homework.  One woman in the audience called out quite snottily that she didn't receive a pencil to fill out the survey. Where was her pencil?  I took a deep breath in at the stupidity of some people.  I recognized her as the woman who minutes before downstairs at the ticket booth was complaining that she couldn't buy her tickets a day in advance.  There's always one person...  "The Road Taken" is based on the true story of Kim Son-Myong who spent 45 years in jail for standing up for his beliefs and ideals.  He was a south korean who joined the North Korean army and was imprisoned for being a communist traitor.  The film starts out light...showing how living in a prison has it's own routines and expectations.  How friends or commrades as they called each other were the lifeline to survival.  They had a tapping system on the walls that enabled them to communicate with one another.  Outside news was told through this way.  But soon, you started to feel like you were in that prison with them.  It started to become repeitious.  Torture, bad food, little humanity and yet, still not surrendering to South korean politics were the only thing that kept these men in jail.  Even after 45 years of the character who played Kim Son-Myong is released and free to go on a special pardon, there isn't that sense of redemption.  I was left feeling...quite sad. Not really inspired by this man's fight.  Just wondering, if it really was worth it?  His whole life..gone, spent in a jail.  He watched as all his friends left or died.  And for what?  To be loyal to his beliefs?    Thankfully, the next movie I saw that night was the Korean, romantic comedy (emphasis on the comedy) called "Please Teach me English."  The backbone of the story was Korea's facination to learn english.  It's believed that if you speak english, it will advance your career, your love life and will open all doors to the infinite possibilities in life.  Na Yeong Ju, an entry level, government offical is picked out of everyone in her office to learn how to speak english because of a run in with an angry customer.  She attends enlish classes and meets Park Mun-Soo, a slick rick playboy type who she immediately falls for. He in turn likes the Australian English teacher, Cathy.  I was anticipating this movie being similar to "My Sassy Girl," my all time favorite Korean film.  But...it actually topped it.  I have never laughed so hard in a movie theatre!  And it wasn't just sections that were chucklesome.  The whole movie...I laughed, the audience laughed...every was laughing.  Certain parts, the audience even clapped, they were so entertained.  This was the kind of movie experience I was used to at this festival. A packed crowd, craning your neck to read the subtitles..and laugh out loud fun.  Hands down, I would recommend this movie to anyone who needs a little pep in their step.  A Korean film not to be missed!

      Today was the second day of attending the NY Asian Film Festival.  Out of all the films I planned to see, this was the film I was anticipating the most.  I knew I was going for work purposes, but I couldn't help but insert my own personal biases toward Korean films.  Not only was it a romantic comedy (my all time favorite type of genre...and yes, my tastes drive home the stereotypical girl preference)....but there was dancing!   Call me strange, but I am a sucker for any movie that showcases dancing.  I've even stooped as low as to watch "Centerstage" since dancing was the main focus.  I was imagining this film to be compared to "Strictly Ballroom."  I couldn't wait to see if my assumption was correct.  I walked in at 8pm, a half hour before showtime and was slightly disturbed to find absolutely no crowd.  No lines, nothing.  I was insulted on behalf of all korean romantic comedies out there.  Around 8:15, a small crowd started to form. Even though the film was supposed to start at 8:30pm, the 6:30pm screening hadn't even let out yet.  Instead of crowding at the bottom level of the theatre, people started to form a line up the stairs.  This was good to alieviate the bottle necking effect down below, but wasn't wise as far as control.  Anyone could stand on the stairs even if they didn't have a ticket and get in. The ticket takers and ushers were no where to be found.  Finally at 8:30pm, the crowd was let out and we were let in.  The sense of urgency to have the film start on time, the people standing in the back of the theatre wearing headsets were glaringly missing.  But since no one seemed to be worried about the late start, I wasn't either.  I looked around the audience and noticed that this night's crowd mostly consisted of young Asian professionals.  Probably Korean.  In the year's past Koreans came out in droves to support the Korean films showcased in the festival.  My Sassy Girl, JSA and Chingu all were sold out.  JSA was so popular that they added another screening to meet the high demand.  Tonight would not be a sold out show.  A few minutes later a man introduced the start of the show.  I couldn't help but be disappointed that Grady wasn't introducing the film.  His energy and exaggerated voice stirred the crowd into excitement and always induced laughter.  This guy was bland and barely audible since microphones didn't seem to exist in the theatre.  He simply said that the drawing was about to happen. Tonight was a chance to win:    *"God of Cookery" DVD    *"Double Vision" VCD    *Zatauchi Tshirt I crossed my fingers hoping that my name would be pulled and I could win the "God of Cookery" DVD.  We had screened "God of Cookery" at our festival, but I wasn't able to watch it myself.  The names were announced quickly and without any flare.  My name was not called. Would I ever win one of these drawings?!  "Dance With the Wind," directed by Park Jun-Woo gave us a glimpse into the shady world of..gasp, dance.  Starting with the jive and working up to ballroom dancing, Poongshik (played by Lee Sung-Jae) is innately drawn to dance. He finds himself seducing married women and taking their money, not because he's a gigalo, but because of his deep love and need for dance.  Yeonhwa, an undercover cop is assigned to the case to bring Poongshik down.  Apparently Poongshik seduced the wrong woman, the police captains wife...and now justice must be served.  Yeonhwa is checked into the hospital with a fake neck injury to get closer to Poongshik, who for reasons that aren't explained upfront is also serving time in the hospital.  Poongshik tells Yeonhwa the story of his life, how he became a smooth, sauve, irressistable ladies magnet, but most importantly, a passionate dancer.  There are more twists and explainations to his story, but what shines out the most is the appreciation for the art of dance.  Also, there are laugh out loud, funny moments.  The best scene by far is the first dance instructor Poongshik seeks out.  A tiny old man who can barely stir in sugar for his tea, but becomes a young 20-something year old man again once he starts to dance.  The last half of the movie starts to drag, and the ending is not clearly defined, but all in all a very enjoyable film.

      I'm back in NYC, the place I called home before I moved to SF.  I came for some personal business, but decided to extend my stay so I could attend two Asian Film festivals: the NY Asian Film festival (June 18-27) and Asian Cinevision's film festival (July 16-24).  I had gone to these festivals while living in NY, but had come from a different perspective, as a viewer or patron.  I wasn't looking out for structure, organization and if any of these films could potentially be shown in our festival.  Now, with a year of festival experience behind me, I had a different agenda in mind.  I was going to see how their festivals ran operationally, to network, to publicize NAATA and our festival and to watch films that could potentially be showcased in our festival.  NY ASIAN FILM FESTIVAL:  I entered the Anthology Film Archives at 6:15pm (a museum known for preserving and exhibiting films as an art form), and was surprised to find a short line in front of the box office.  Usually 15 minutes before showtime, there was a long line outside that wrapped around the building with people anxiously waiting to buy a ticket.  On my way up to the 200 seat theatre, I was handed a survey.   Inside the theatre, I was again surprised at the low turn out.  The first three rows were practically empty and other vacant seats were sporadically spaced here and there.  I figured about 70% of the theatre was filled. Usually the shows were sold out and I had to fight for a seat.  I reasoned that it was a 6:30pm weeknight showing.  Most people in NY didn't get out of work till after 7pm. I also noted that the majority of the crowd seemed to be white.  This was evidence of the growing, if not established interest for Asian culture and arts by non-asian folks.  At 6:30pm instead of the movie starting, workers climbed up a tall ladder to fix a hanging drape that would have blocked a corner of the screen.  The movie was obviously not going to start on time.  My theatre operational mind kicked in and I did a time count. If we started at 6:30pm, the film was 108 minutes long, so it would end at 8:18pm.  This did not include the introduction and commerical/ trailer time.  Add another 10 minutes.  So really, we'd be exiting the theatre around 8:30pm, also the time when the next film was supposed to start. I wondered who did the programming schedule? Usually the rule of thumb to turn around a theatre (exit the people from the theatre, clean the theatre, and fully seat the next screening) is a 1/2 hour.    As I waited,  I was vaguely aware of the music video by Full Metal Alchemist playing on screen.  I looked around the theatre for any posters or signs of the sponsors.  There were two huge hanging posters that said, "Discover the tiger!"  I could only guess that it was advertising Tiger beer, their main sponsor.  At 6:36pm, Grady (one of the organizers for the festival) started the show.  In an exaggerated, game show host way he: 			*welcomed the crowd    *annouced the two sponsors (Tiger Beer & Yesasia.com)    *explained the audience award    *announced last minute changes in schedule and added titles     *read a review of the film festival from The New Yorker Then came my favorite part.   Where he announced  the winners of the drawing.   Audience members that dutifully filled out their surveys were automatically entered to win a chance at three prizes--a movie poster, a mask or a dvd.  My name was not drawn. Sadly, I was not a winner. This past year at our festival, we also had an audience survey and membership forms that we wanted people to fill out right away.  The trick is to give them the incentive to want to do this.  I thought the instant gratification, win a prize from a drawing (right now) worked well at the NY Asian Film festival.    Finally the screening started.  We sat through two commercials for Tiger beer, 1 commercial for yesasia.com and two movie trailers (both that were not subtitled) before the actual film started.  I leaned back in my seat preparing to soak in the movie.    "Macabre Case of Prom Pi Ram," directed by Manop Udomdej is a film that quietly peels away the darkness of the human condition in a small country town. It starts out with two good cops who are determined to solve the mysterious murder of an unknown girl found dead next to the train tracks.  Told in a linear fashion with full scenes of flashbacks to what really happened, this is not a complicated story.  But as the movie progresses forward, the horror of what this woman had to endure becomes painful to watch. Thoughts of oh no, oh no...not again? Not again!  raced through my mind. It would make any woman, passive feminest or activist want to jump into the screen and save this victim from the awful, sick men who seem to have no conscience.  The only redemention for the victim is that the cops do solve the case by the end.  I left the theatre in a daze, still thinking about the film, trying to sort out how I really felt about it.  Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a line wrapped around the building seeming to have no end. It was 8:45pm, and the next screening would soon be underway. I smiled, happy for the crowd that they were about to see an incredible film, "Vibrator" and proud of the NY Asian film festival for attracting such interest on a Monday night.

      File Under: Reconnaissance  Last night Taro, Chi-hui, Khristine (intern) & I attended the opening night party for  urlLink FRAMELINE 28 . Michael & crew put on an amazingly good party. The event took place at  urlLink City Hall  to commemorate the strides that Gay & Lesbian marriage has had this year. The gala was fun with plenty of alcohol flowing and Jimi Mistry and Kyle Maclachlan representin'.   As always it's a social/work event. I go into these gala parties with darting eyes. And what do I see? There seems to be an increase in using projections and/or transparencies for logos on walls during opening night festivities. The special events planner utilized the space very creatively, breaking the party up into three rooms (1) the main foyer with a string quartet playing, (2) the live band covering disco-era music room, and (3) the quiet room with tables and very little ambient music. It worked out really well, the event didn't feel packed, but felt full of people. The flow of the crowd was pretty awesome and one didn't have to wait more than 5-10 minutes in the busiest of lines (for alcohol).   Frameline rocks! Catch a movie if you get a chance, the  urlLink Festival  runs through June 27th.

      File Under: Film Festival Planning  Not long after  urlLink our 2004 festival  has wrapped, we’re already at work gearing up for next year, and it starts with opening our  urlLink call for entries . And with this, my very first blog ever, I’m going to write about a first for our festival—an online submission process.  We’re partnering with  urlLink Withoutabox.com , a company established just a few years ago. The way it works is that filmmakers enjoy discounts and the convenience of submitting forms online, while festivals are able to import data directly into the database rather than wasting hours of staff time manually inputting information as indicated on the printed forms. (We help save trees, too, by using online press kits!) Considering that the technology itself (an online application form) is not difficult to create, and since Withoutabox.com charges a commission on each entry, we weren’t initially sold on the merit of this service.  But one notion intrigued us. Since Withoutabox.com has over 30,000 filmmakers using their system, if even a small percentage of those filmmakers have Asian American projects to submit, we could potentially reach several hundred eligible applicants and perhaps help increase the number of submissions we receive.   The two big questions are these:  1) What percentage of the filmmakers out there are Asian American (or making Asian American films)? 2) Of those, how many are familiar with our festival?  There’s no way to really know, but by the end of the year, we’ll find out if Withoutabox has helped us find more Asian American projects. Then there’s always the issue of a number of Asian American filmmakers choosing to not submit their work to an Asian American film festival, hoping instead to screen at a more "mainstream" festival, but that’s a whole other topic to be discussed later.

      File Under: Miscellaneous  This weekend we had a very well-attended event. It was called  HEROic Visions , a conversation with Ellen Poon (Special effects advisor on  Hero ). Yes, we should have posted about it here. But you know, we're ramping up now.    Laying the groundwork for WORK.   Which segues quite nicely into the presentation we had today at the "now weekly" staff meeting. Last week  urlLink NAATA  decided that if we were to get a better grasp on our org and where we are going [this relates to a Scenario planning meeting we had a few weeks ago that was facilitated by the  urlLink Global Business Network  --- they asked us this question: "Where would you (NAATA/Your Dept.) be given different combos of political/funding/social scenarios?"] Individual/ Cross-departmental ideas of where certain departments would be or where they would flourish was varied. At the staff meeting we realized that perhaps it made sense for everyone at NAATA to engage in more interdepartmental dialogue.   So today  urlLink Festival  was up to bat first. We gave a rather thorough assessment of where we are and where we want to be. We also fielded questions from fellow staffers regarding our goals and practices and also how the financials will pan out.     It seems do-able, these goals. Having Chi-hui, Taro &amp; I hash them out and then present them helps us address how we plan to accomplish everything. In a way we are moving in towards an essential team building phase and it feels pretty good.

      File Under: Film Festival Planning  Last week Taro, Chi-hui and I sat down to try to envision the Festival in 2006 and 2010. It seems an important question, yet one that hasn't been asked in the recent past. "Where is the  urlLink SFIAAFF  going?"  We need to imagine where we want the SFIAAFF to be, so that we can work backwards to put policies and practices into place to make that vision a reality. It is important to write this information down, to concretely outline our hopes and dreams for the SFIAAFF so that the Festival proceeds at a trajectory that we'd like it to (whether or not we will be personally here to carry out all the policies and practices).    We're still working out the details of many of the nitty gritty of the vision, but some tidbits include a good brand and an event that is a destination.   The best thing about this exercise is us sharing what we each consider an ideal SFIAAFF.

      File Under: Synopsis & Review   urlLink HAROLD & KUMAR GO TO WHITECASTLE  is a very light romp in the vein of DUDE, WHERE'S MY CAR? (written by the same peeps). The movie is enjoyable in the same way as well. Weird things happen to Harold Lee (John Cho) and Kumar Patel (Kal Penn) as they embark on an Odyssey worthy search for Whitecastle Sliders after smoking out in their apartment.  Their very long evening includes Neil Patrick Harris on ecstasy stealing their car, a ride on a cheetah, the offer of a foursome with a hot woman and her disfigured husband, bullet wound surgery, a trip to Princeton University, and a jailbreak.   Critics will very likely point to the undeveloped female characters as the main disappointment in the flick. (And yes, that could be better.) Others may point to some of the very obvious race focused jokes, but you know what - that's just life. The characters of Harold & Kumar come off like regular Asian American guys and for Hollywood that is very commendable.  I'm not a fan of these types of easy-gag type of movies, but I enjoyed Harold & Kumar for everything that it is. And when I left I told my friend that I liked it much better than  urlLink DODGEBALL .

      File Under: Fundraising  So I'm back with the writing proposals and sending out of packets. I'm in asking mode again. We have big aspirations this year and with the economy looking  urlLink bleak . It may be a tough sell. We're looking to get a big cable channel, a car company, and a mobile phone company to get in there and represent. If any one feels generous, please advocate for us at your company.  For more information about sponsorship benefits go to our  urlLink website . Please call soon, I'll be waiting by the phone.
