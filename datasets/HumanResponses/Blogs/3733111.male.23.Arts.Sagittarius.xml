      Well here we go.  Continuation of Dreams, Twist of Fury, Dawn Chorus, Bird of Sorrow and a few others are now at 60% completion.  There is still a lot to do obviously, volume control, mastering, panning and of course if there's any mistakes detected, sort them out.  This progress will take most of the remaining months before the finalisation.  I cant wait until I get whatever comes back from Kim Novak, this will be the very first time I've collaborated with anyone so obviously, I hope it goes well.  I'll keep this blog posted.  If there's still anything thats getting in the way at the moment, its the vocoder.  Don't get me wrong, Vokator is a good program but it still has its flaws, the amount of work which I have had to do just to make it sound right has been awkward.  Nethertheless, in some areas such as voice-overs on the album, its been a true gem.  So whats for 26th June?  More work on Forgotten Realm.  This is beginning to sound like the next track to beat "The Traveller" techincally and of course musically (in my own opinion).  The general happy sound of it all gives it a life of its own, I love it to death.  Main areas I'll be working on are just basically completion of the whole track.

      Damn, this track is proving to be difficult in some areas.  The constant swearing im getting from my equipment has really got to me.  However yesterday, I bought some brand new cables (gold plated) and they seem to be doing their job for what I paid.  Mind you, I cant wait until I get the basics out the way so I can send the raw material to Kim Novak, the female singer currently signed with Ampcast, she has agreed to sing for me and I hope it all turns out good.  So today is mainly to get Bird of Sorrow out of the way, once and for all, well..., until later for finalising.  Forgotten Realm, another track Im working on will also get some treatment today PLUS a rehearsal with Ampcast's Radio director as the 1 year anniversary of FutureScape draws near, its always a pleasure to play for audiences who generally love the art of music, no matter what genre it is but knowing its still all good.  So playing FutureScape live on the 28th will be wonderful.

      Oh yes.  The very instant I thought of creating such an intense track came when I approached the program "Vokator" and its really cool functions.  I suddenly realised that voice-overs and effects would work in what I wanted, which was completely depressing moods, fantastic drones and surreal-sounding leads.  This 12 minute beast will be one of the dominating tracks on my forthcoming album, no doubt about it.  About the seventh minute, there is a wonderful minimal background effect complete with "horror" style toybox voice which when I heard it after the production, gave me goosebumps, something Ive been wanting to achieve for a long time.  Im still not sure if the final track name will be called 'Nightmare' but it definitely was suited at this moment.  You can actually check out the early sample of this track called "Untitled" which can be found on my official site.

      I am so impressed with what Ive done with the beta version of Twist of Fury.  Its an intense 10 minute track which represents wicked thoughts and bad actions.  The lyrics are intresting aswell (thanks to Heather Whitticker), it explains how one person could act on certain impulses and how a person could look at certain things such as loved ones, the area around him/her and what finally triggers the person into making these drastic actions.  Here is a example of lyrics taken from Twist of Fury.    THE WORDS SHE NEVER SAID, BLIND ALLEYS IN HER HEAD, ALL LEAD TO WORLDS OF PAIN WHERE 'GUILTY' HOLDS NO BLAME.  SO VERY COLD TONIGHT, BUT HER HEART'S WARM AND BRIGHT AND NEVER ONE TO BLAME, RAW WHISKY KEEPS HER SANE.  HER BED, A SPLINTERED BENCH COOL AIR DEPLETES THE STENCH, THIS FREEDOM-PARADISE LUXURY WILL SUFFICE.  HER DUVET, FROZEN NEWS, A FUTURE SHE MAY CHOOSE, WITH EYES OF MISTY RAIN, HER NUMBNESS REPELS PAIN.  THE WORDS SHE NEVER SAID....... BY MORNING SHE WAS DEAD.....

      Well, people who know me personally and technically will know that Ive told them everytime I mention the word 'Dreamers', its a curse.  Im currently going through some awful computer problems which has resulted in all componment failure, which seems terribly nasty but I have managed to save two hard disks and also lost WinXP but installed.......... wait for it.., Windows ME.  I currently have no sound either which is odd, I think this has come down to a bad installation and I dont really have the time and energy to resolve it just yet, which means .. yes.. 'Dreamers Two' is on hold yet again.  I would have to work for a considerable number of hours to get the project back on schedule.  But without stressing, Im leaving it, cant be bothered at the moment, and who wouldnt especially when you have a crappy pre-installed PC which anyone can buy from a retail shop.  Oh well....    Yes, Identity.  This interesting project is designed to bring around the best unsigned independant musicians, DJs, turntablists, performers and songwriters from the UK city of Manchester.  But what has this got to do with me?  Well Identity also promote and go to venues for these performers to well.... perform and, I have had a little discussion with an adviser to get myself a possible event with Identity, which will be interesting and certainly exciting and a relief for me.  But its only talk at the moment but I'll definitely keep you posted.  Watch this space.

      And before I start, special thanks to Robin Hosgood who helped me out with the printing side of things.  Knowing that I havent really bragged too much about Dreamers Two as yet, I thought I'd create and release a rare promo CD with around 6 or 7 tracks (early workings) and send it to the people who want it.  Up to now, I've had some good feedback from it, I still have a few CDs left so if you would like one, please email me at charibis@ntlworld.com  Of course, I'll be sending the promo CDs to the professional guys such as the critics, music magazines, people in public.  This will be an ongoing project until I stop producing them in late September, hopefully the reception will be a good one.  I still would like to get myself a printer, I dont have one and it really buggers up a lot of things for me, its awful when one is strapped for cash.  Ink cartridges, I dont think I would be able to afford any of them either, they're so damned expensive.  Who knows, I might get lucky soon.  I went to witness a fantastic gig on the 3rd.  The UK Jean Michel Jarre tribute band, Jarrelook performed at Preston and I was absolutely gobsmacked by their audio/visual concert.  The nerves which were clearly noticed in the first part were overidden as the event progressed.  Martin (one half of Jarrelook) was eager to show and prove that his new instrument, the laser harp, did work.  And that it did, with the extra of it being polyphonic, I dont think I've seen such a device to my little naked eye.  It certainly inspired me, not to go out and create a laser harp but the idea to perform on a much livlier scale than ever before.  The prospect of performing on stage is still something I so dearly want to achieve.  It will come, I feel it.  So what's new with my music side, Im still experimenting with "Nightmare" which Ive already had comments from being "interesting and unusual".  I still need to make up my mind about "Forgotten Realm" at the moment as Im making some alternative versions which sound cool and its beginning to be awkward to choose (I've been down this road a few times...).  I've been designing a limited edition CD cover for when Dreamers Two does eventually get released, I've stated the fact that the limited edition will have that album, plus the predecessor as a bonus, completely remastered.  I am still looking for the perfect Dreamers Two art to be the cover.

      I am now planning a limited edition release called 'Dr3amers' which will include the forthcoming album 'Dreamers Two' and its predecessor.  'Dr3amers' will also have some cool rare items which can only be accessed via PC which includes early versions of music tracks, FutureLive 2002 dress rehearsal video, pictures, CD art and other things which still are to be considered.  The predecessor will also be digitally remastered for fine CD audio and will include tracks which weren't released on the original album such as "Bells II" (title to be changed).  I am currently working on the 'Dreamers Two' & 'Dr3amers' CD art which I will unveil within the months to come, because of the PC problems Im currently going through, I've had to time stretch things a little.  Question is, will 'Dr3amers LE' be widely available?  I'm still working with many ways talking with a few companies regarding this.  Its still early days but I think the Limited Edtion album will be on Ampcast and SMD for a .... well, limited time only.  I also hope to get some art from Robin Hosgood, who really saved my life by printing out the 'Dreamers Two' Promo CDs and he REALLY is a fantastic graphic designer when it comes to programs like Photoshop.  You can check out his art @ http://cousteau.deviantart.com/

       I have decided to perform online 2 months before the big FutureLive 2004 event, which will headline my forthcoming album 'Dreamers Two'.&nbsp; "CJ2k4 Live" will be specially dedicated to everyone who has supported me throughout this year, especially those people on IRC and especially my friends, family and of course my fiancee.&nbsp; I have still yet to decide what kind of theme I want to create as part of CJ2k4 but im sure I'll enjoy it as I'll know that my new album will be practically completed.&nbsp; Note though, no 'Dreamers Two' tracks will be played during CJ2k4 Live.    &nbsp;  My involvement with iDentity, the organisation which brings aboard unsigned musicians, DJs and other great singer/songwritters, is definitely looking positive for a possible CJ mini-tour and maybe even a outdoor concert but, dont quote me on that..... yet.&nbsp; I'm so glad that iDentity are interested in my musicial abilities and it would be an awesome prospect to finally get the limelight I most sorely need.    &nbsp;  'CJ2k4 Live' details will be unearthed next month on cjwray.com and of course here.  &nbsp;

      Just some various things to talk about on this post.&nbsp; I'm still in the middle of designing the  'Dreamers Two'  CD art, I still cant make my mind up.&nbsp; There is also the  'Dr3amers : LE'  cover art to think about but I think I got it okay.&nbsp;   Just to confuse no-one, the difference between  'Dreamers Two'  and the limited edition version is, in the LE, it will be a special package containing the new album plus a remastered version of the 2002 album ' Dreamers '.&nbsp; It will also contain some various unheard material, notes, pictures and possible a video to finish the LE package with style.  I am&nbsp;now considering the possibility to release future albums on iTunes via CDBaby.com.&nbsp; I never really thought about it at first, who wouldnt considering I devote most of my time to Ampcast.&nbsp; It is very appealing though, I mean iTunes, there are many posibilites just by having your album sold there.&nbsp; Its also probably the biggest thing at the moment, with thousands of pc and mac users downloading if there's no tomorrow.  Just a little bit more on the project "iDentity".&nbsp; If my calculations are correct (which they usually arent), I would guess I'll know a little more about the mini-tour (if there's one at all) and possibly the great outdoor Manchester Piccadilly Gardens concert which is definitely talked about but not planned as yet.&nbsp; More on that very soon I hope.

      Its time.  Well, its time for me to get my backside off the sofa more and really getting in to my album as it prepares for the third stage, bringing all the tracks together.  Whilst I'm still wondering if certain tracks will actually recieve the final cut is anyone's guess, I know I need to clock the whole album with the tracks I have, to give me a good rough guess in how long the album is gonna last.  Continutation of Dreams still needs a lot of work, so do some others but I am still confident.  Music aside, the promoting will start today with some shameless plugs around the Internet.  The Internet I hear you scream?  Well of course, Im not entirely sure where I would be today if it wasnt for the world wide web.... probably serving burgers.  Its a shame mp3.com isnt around now and Im not prepared to step foot into the rebirth of the site either (music.download.com).  No, Ampcast.com is definitely the promotion point, as of course is this blog, the new photo blog site (which I'll come to in a mo..) and the shameless promotions on the official site and Yahoo groups.  It starts now, you'll probably see it everywhere, well... anywhere I can get it anyway.  Mailing lists, groups, OMDs, chatrooms, David Law's Synth Music Direct, CD Baby, iTunes (maybe), newspapers, articles, flyers, posters, mini-tours (ahem) and other ways which Im sure I'll come to later on.  Yes,  urlLink http://dreamerstwo.buzznet.com  is online.  Dreamerstwo.buzznet is where you'll see the official photos of 'Dreamers Two' artwork and some various cj pictures.  Other question is, where can *you* hear the new stuff?  Official site of course, in fact, go there now before it gets replaced with a better flash file, if you check out the 'Dreamers Two' page, you'll find it there, it will take a long while to load (10mb) but as soon as its finished loading, you can click on the track titles to get an excerpt.  Happy clicking.

      Whilst 'Dreamers Two' is pretty much themed at both good and bad dreams, its obvious to make sure that certain tracks reflect a certain good or bad dream theme.  When I also realised that Dark Ambient was going to take a huge part in my next album aswell as other certain unusual sound effects, it was and still is probably the most difficult album I've ever created.  Happy feelings equals good so, its important to try and capture that theme by creating melodies which are cheerful and of course, happy.  I think I have achieved that with a track called "Forgotten Realm".  Disturbing thoughts could lead to bad dreams, I used my imagination and created themes which, instead of melodies, it becomes this 'Dark Ambient' composistion which I can only describe as "bloody disturbing".  Also voices, crowds, talking and whispering sounds create the atmosphere I wanted to give in this particular project.  I believe my track 'Nightmare' and 'Seclusion' are perfect adjectives for those themes.  There are of course many many thoughts one person can reflect on and only one album which for me, I would go on and no, there wont be a 'Dreamers 3' for various reasons.  At the same time, the themes I have set for the sequel are like nothing I've ever done.  Ever.  And I know people will be surprised, hell, if my father thinks it's odd, that's all the feedback you'll ever need.  I guess its because I know there has been a lot of work put into this album and the technical side of things have improved by a factor of a million.
