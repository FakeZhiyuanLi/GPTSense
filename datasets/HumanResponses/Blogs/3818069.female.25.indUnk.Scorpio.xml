						   This is my brand new list of WIP's: (Old list nolong applies.)
Date: 19: Whom it’s for: Brieanna ("step-niece", 7): 7. 1st new project: Carousel Horse. Size: 8 x 9 (w/ 2in) Small project. Well, I am off to a horrible start.... I did 30 minutes of stitching and then...&nbsp;I dropped my needle. I cannot find it anywhere. Yes,&nbsp;I only had one needle. Yes, I've looked several times for more but the store never has them.&nbsp;I even tried a magnet like someone told me. I am going to have to barrow some from a lady that lives near me (I hope). I&nbsp;plan to go on with my new projects as planned. This stress Really is not helping.
Date: 20: Whom it’s for: Amy (my "mother"): 2nd new project, “Amy” (an angel). Size: 22 x 13 (w/ 2in.)&nbsp; Big project. I just cannot believe it... I barrowed 2 needles from my neighbor when&nbsp;I lost mine. The fabric I'm working with is hard and stiff. Both needles snapped like toothpicks when I attempted a quarter stitch. After talking to Jen A, I have decided that as soon as funds allow I will invest in several packs of #24 tapestry needles. Now&nbsp;I have to go tell the neighbor that&nbsp;I broke her needles and I will have to get her what she had. Is it me or is cross-stitching not my thing? I can see that “Amy” is going to take a long time.
Date: 21: Whom it’s for: Olivia ("niece"): 3rd new project, Angel Bear. Size: 9 x 8 (w/ 2in) Small project. As fate would have it, I am to start Olivia’s project on her 6th month anniversary of life! Date: 22: Whom it’s for: Brenda (stitching friend): 4th new project, Friends (bunnies) Size: 12 x 13 (w/ 2in.) Big project.&nbsp; Funny, but Brenda never put 2 and 2 together and I have been talking to her about it since last week…LOL&nbsp;
Date: 23: Whom it’s for: Filip (my dog): 5th new project, Black Lab Puppy (Filip is a mix but this is closest to him, although there is no lab in him at all) 6 x 5&nbsp; (w/ 2in.) Small project. Hardly did any work on it.
Date: 24: My project (my first large piece): 6th day project, The Toy Shop started 23 x 17 (w/ 2in) Big project. I will be starting a large doll with a pink dress. Worked more on the puppy tonight. 
Date: 25: Kitchen project (sunflowers): 7th day project, “S” is for sunflower EMS started July 12th Small project. 
At this time I am not currently in any RR's, SAL's, or exchanges.
Ask me for my list of up and coming projects, patterns for trade and sale, and my wish list. Send yous to:&nbsp; urlLink thetoyshop0204@yahoo.com

						   10: I had a very nice and relaxing day. I read another 35 pages which puts me on page 376. I am 20 pages off from the 55 pages I want to be reading a day. I hope to have more time to read one of these days and catch up. I am 40 pages behind and that’s almost one whole days worth. 
After that I went out and almost got clobbered twice. Once when a girl I know clobbered the guy that wouldn’t leave us alone, and once when Selina’s husband almost got into a fight with a guy that was waiting to smack him with a beer bottle. Other then that I was ok. Joe was there but after making a fool out of myself trying to talk to him when I don’t speak Spanish, I just left him alone. 
11: I had another good day today. I talked some on the net, I was invited to roast dinner, and I read some. I was so happy to just sit and read. It is so calming and relaxing. I found myself not in pain sitting at my computer, but lost in the story of my book. I’m now on page 445, 69 pages read. I did catch myself wondering something interesting. Stephen King has always had really long books and as I read I could not help but wonder if there was such things as too much detail. I seem to see that the details on one small thing go on for pages. I think he has the same problem I do, not knowing how to stop once you get on a role.&nbsp; 
I also sent in my Doubleday book club card today but there is one thing I messed up on. I looked online for books because I found nothing in the book that I wanted or don’t already have. Online the books have a 6 number code. In the book it’s a 4 number code. I hope they will take the 6 number codes that I put on the card. We will see what happens. If not I will have to see what I can do about getting the books I have already picked out: The Intelligencer- Leslie Silbert, Aphrodite- Russell Andrews, Obsession and Possession- Wendy Morgan, Every Secret Thing- Laura Lippman, The Da Vinci Code- Dan Brown, You Only Die Twice- Edna Buchanan, Lost Boy, Lost Girl- Peter Straub. The 15 others wanted: Murder Suicide- Kevin Ablow, Play Dead- Anne Frasier, Just One Look- Harlen Coben, Tell No One- Harlan Coben, Firestorm- Iris Johansen, Peril- Thomas H. Cook,&nbsp; Play With Fire- Peter Robinson, Mr. Paradise- Elmore Leonard, The Kills- Linda Fairstein, Desert Places- Blake Crouch, The Night Country- Stewart O’Nan, A Faint Cold Fear- Karin Slaughter, A Terrible Beauty- Graham Masterton, The Apprentice- Tess Gerritsen, Writ of Execution- Perri O’Shaughnessy; plus: John Sandford’s “Prey” series (13), and James Patterson’s “Alex Cross” series (8). 
I really enjoyed my day right up until things went totally down hill. My maintenance man knocked on my door telling me to pick up after my dog. After squinting at him he pointed. I picked it up and threw it away, I was not happy at all. I told him Filip is sick and has not been out to go all week. He laughed at me. Then I asked if they planed to fix the ceiling that is still leaking after they have been in here numerous times trying to fix it. I’m done. If they want to know if something is broken, they can knock on my door and inspect. Otherwise if something gets ruined, it’s not my fault. It has been over 2 months that they have piddled around with not fixing things. I’m done. They actually thanked me for telling them before it got to be a big mess. Then when I had to call them and say I told you but you never did anything and now it’s a horrible mess, are you going to come fix it now? They are just dumb. 
They came in and looked at it and I ended up in a shouting match with the landlord. He is threatening to kick me out because I filed a complaint on what needed to be fixed. He said he has talked to my last 3 landlords, and the low-income people and they all told him what a troublemaker I am. Yes, I will complain if something needs to be fixed, but there are drunks, drug sellers, people who have extra people living with them, and all kinds of other rule breaking going on and I get it for wanting something fixed? I think I’ve missed something, how about you? 
Anyway, I was looking at the patterns I printed out and have decided that I am not going to do any pieces with half stitches in them for a while. The Champagne bottle and the “Do Not Disturb” have no half stitches and I can start them both as long as I have the fabric. I have run into a snag as the latter has a number for the fabric and no color. I am getting many things in the mail this week and I hope that I can start at least one piece then. I might go between that and my “Toy Shop”. 
12: I have to whine here a bit so bare with me.... I meet this guy named Joe at the bar about a month ago. He is Mexican but OMG he looks like he walked out of a model magazine!!! I "talked" to him a bit the first times&nbsp;I saw him and he said he liked me too.
We even danced some, slow danced! He was warring black coveralls the first time&nbsp;I saw him and I just had to snicker because they actually looked quite good on him. The best night was the night he came and&nbsp;I talked to him almost all night. He was warring black pants, tight in the seat, lose in the hips and pressed like professions clothes are. He had on a matching black shirt with the collar open revealing a thin gold chain that drove me up the wall! He let me rub his and back and loop my arm through his. I was even told that he gave a really dirty look to a drunken guy that was trying to get me to dance with him.
Then things went to ****! I came to find out that he doesn't speak English or "claims" not to. His friends... are the towns cross dressers, which I don't care about, but a lot of&nbsp;people are just mean. I tried to talk to him again once and that was a total flop as I don't have the Spanish to even say "HI" to him, I guess. Heartbreaking.... He seems like the sweetest guy. Like the type that would be loving but at the same time stand up to anyone that crossed you.&nbsp;I have given up.&nbsp;I saw him the other night and I didn't even bother him. All I could do is do my best to ignore him. Probably look like a total fool trying to dance to the crap they played, and after that to anything being as I used to just goof off and have fun but I got yelled at for that. So, now I look even worst trying to dance but not dance and I cannot seem to just&nbsp;stay off the dance floor so I'm hopeless. I keep trying to tell myself that I really do have the good end of the deal. If I did get together with him, knowing me I would hurt him, make him mad, or do something stupid, and lose him. I'd end up being the one with the broken heart. So, it's better to just look and not touch. I can always dream...and who says&nbsp;I don't??? Crazy, I see myself in hell but I am all the better in dreamland then brokenheartsville. 
I started a brand new cross-stitch piece today. It should only take me a week to do. I am not going to tell anyone what it is until it’s finished. If I do that it will get done and I will be happy with it. I will reveal it when I’m done. 
I watched 3 movies. I talked a bit on the net. I clipped pictures out of my magazines, and I went to my neighbors at 11pm and had coffee and talked. It started to storm and I made Filip mad because he wanted to go out and play in the mud and I told him no. I didn’t get any reading done to day. Other then that nothing really happened today. It was pretty drug-out and slow.
13: They came and finally put my ceiling back together today after a week of fiddling with a leaking pipe. I am really hoping the stupid thing is fixed this time. 
I got up and checked e-mails and then the mail. Great mail day! I received 39 patterns in the mail today so I was happy. Spent most of the day getting them all typed out in a list and deciding which ones to do soon and which ones to wait on. I was so happy to get some really nice ones for a change.
Well, I never have a day go by without something going wrong and it did. I sent patterns to a lady and after “10 days” she claims she still doesn’t have them. She sent me fabric and I got it in 3 days. She started yelling at me demanding to know where they were and I told her I don’t control the mail. Then she told me that she thinks I never sent them and “You don’t know what a good friend you lost…” I told her that when they are delivered late I would be expecting an apology. I even offered to send her replacement ones. She just told me to forget it as I had one on the list I forgot to take off and she got all mad. I don’t care, I don’t need people like that but I still plan to send the new patterns, as I want them gone anyway. 
I worked for a few hours on my cross-stitch. I have been working with 3 different greens and I can hardly see which is which in the finished piece. I have been doing well and the picture is coming out nicely. I cannot wait to finish this, as I want to hang it in my kitchen. Your only hint is that it is of the theme of my kitchen. 
I also read more of my book today and it got really weird because I can see in my head the movie. It’s really weird to read something with this sense of déjà vu behind it. I have read other S. K. books where I have seen the movie too but usually read the book and then saw the movie. Weird! I read 36 pages, now on page 481. 
14: I slept a lot today. I have yucky stomach. I got up, ate, had a pop and turned on the fan, finally took a shower and I started to feel better. Did 6 hours of stitching today! I just couldn’t put it down. I am starting to see an outline. I have to get a few colors I need for it, but it’s coming along great. I was off one stitch on the out side and couldn’t find the mistake so I hope letting it go won’t bite me later. I also watched the movie On The Line and I thought it was great. 
15: Went shopping today! I got three shirts, a tie-dye, a “Grumpy Bear” and the kitty from Peppi La Pu and 2 bandanas, blue stripe and orange stripe. I badly needed new shirts. I have no decent clothes and I think have new things will make me happier. I know I cannot afford them, but they were found on the $3 rack at Wal-Mart. I also was bought some floss and fabric for the projects I want to do. I bought dinner at $5. (Which was nowhere near what they spent on me.) They want me to do a pattern for them.
After that I had a meeting to find out if I need to be taking to someone for all the stress I have been having. It was terrible. The guy acted like I was wasting his time. He kept looking at his watch, cutting me off, and telling me we need to move on. He did that for 45 minutes. He was so rude. I hope the lady I go to is not as rude as him. The only good thing to come out of the visit was to find out that I have lost ten pounds!
After I got back from my meeting, my neighbor asked me to go through all these garbage bags of clothes and pick what I wanted. I got an armful of sweatshirts and some heavier shirts. I guess I don’t have to buy new winter clothes. 
16: I spent the day organizing all my cross-stitch stuff into all the separate drawers. It took me hours to get everything right where it goes. In the future I will be able to get things right when I need them instead of having to dig through a pile or bags of things to get to what I need. 
17: Only thing that happened today was I asked Joe to dance and he told me he doesn’t dance… whatever. Then when I got back to Selina’s house my ID was missing from my other pants…interesting, and the car “overheated” and I had to walk home. Something always has to go wrong when I go out.

						   June 2004: OH MAN! You will never guess what just moved to Marshalltown! A Scrap booking store! I went and they are open but don’t have much yet. They are also going to get stamps because everyone is asking for them. I am so happy! Now if the price of everything would drop!!  I also lost my bike to the storms. I was going to buy a new one for $85 at the shop but I cannot afford it. I haven’t lost any weight in three months. I am tired of working hard for no result. That really upsets me.  1: I woke up today to my dishes back and then got nothing in the mail. I have tons of mail to get ready… but I took a nap instead. I woke up with the worst headache! 2: I mailed some mail today including a gift for a very special lady. I hope she loves the surprise. No mail for me again today; no money, no mail. Meeting with my management team today to recap on finding me a job. 4: Much needed shopping today. Important things like: printer ink, some new earrings that don’t make my ears hurt (I don’t have anything, not even in!), chap stick, TP… now I’m broke after paying all the bills, sending out the mail, and doing the laundry! 8: Groceries! I am back down to $32 a month ($8 a week). I hope this will help me to lose the weight! Everyone by now should know that my goals flop no matter how hard I try so, I don’t know how I am going to make it through saying no to food. 11: Today I was taken advantage of to the hilt! Selina stole meds from my bathroom because she thinks she saw something she thinks I stole from her. She gave them to me telling me they were Sudafed. Now most people would realize that no two pills look the same and so seeing the same pills that I take everyday, I knew she had stolen them. Not to mention that she gave me the packaging on it so on the back of the pill packaging said “benadryl allergy sinus” NOT “Sudafed nighttime sleeping aid” as the box she took them from said. NOW: would you stay friends with this person knowing that they could have tried to poison you for all you know. She screamed at me for not getting into her bar fight and now she pulls this? You would have thought that the time she refused to take me to the hospital was the last straw. Well, I’m done! 16: I had a date today. His name was Jason Thompson, a friend of a friend. He took me to Ames to see the movie “Troy” at the theater. I loved the movie and, of course, OrLaNdO BlOoM! The date was a complete NO, but I’m going to be buying the movie! 17: Today is my “sister’s” birthday. She is 23. I sent her a card. 23: Why am I dating? I can just hear Margaret in my ear.  I am the class clown of boobed-up dates…LOL Crazy how I seem to pick every single loser. Someone help! 20-26: With-in this time I have been working on a bookmark. The cross-stitch pattern is of a worm in an apple on top of a stack of books and it says “Bookworm”. I have been having trouble b/c the lace around the bookmark is coming off and the fabric unraveling right up to the stitching. The bookmark is for a swap that I entered. 
I also worked some on my “Toy Shop”. I did the word “Toys” and the balloons. It is coming along very well. 28-30: I meet a guy named Eric Lee Heck. He’s 22, from Ames, and bares a striking resemblance to the actor DJ Qualls. We have become great friends and found that we have many things in common.  We talk quite a bit online and off. He likes music and listens to rap. He works at The Royal Café as a cook in Huxley. 
I have big plans for stitching in July! I hope to get at least some done each day. I plan to work out something because I have several projects going at one time. Hopefully I will be able to get a little of each one done each week. I will have to get someone on my tail and get off this computer! I cannot wait until I get some of the things finished. I think they will be just the greatest things. I love to see something I have finished. So, I’d better go! Lots to do!

						   5: I was kicked out of the group I was making the bookmark for today for posting the above. I now have a bookmark “for Maureen” and no one to give it to. My post was “inappropriate”. Some people can be so heartless! 
I also found out today that I was/am being bad-mouthed by the lady I was making the “Bless This House” samplers for. She’s telling people I’m a troublemaker. Now I don’t want to even finish it so I will be putting that away. 
I did start a new piece today. It’s a fairy. I did 2 hours of work on her and then had to get to bed. I cannot wait to see what it will look like, as there is no finished picture to see. 
6: Another extremely bad day! Due to that fact that I posted all my projects, I was dumped out of the 2 RR’s I was doing, general and beginners. I was going to do the “Four Seasons of Chairs” pattern. I just needed so floss for it. Now I am down to my 2 projects: Disney RR and my “The Toy Shop”. 
I guess this gives me all the time in the world to work on the piece I want to do called “Angel of Cross stitch” It requires 391 colors, and I am slowly getting all the colors I need. Due to the fact that I need so many for one pattern it is also helping me in building the collection up so I have all the colors.
7: I did an hour on the fairy just to learn that when I did the outline of the wing there was no room to stitch the head! So, I started ripping out my fairy. I had a good day for once! I printed several free patterns off the net. I have a whole stack. 
8: Today I went and did my laundry and grocery shopping. I got a lot of spaghetti and pop. I also got 14 new skeins of floss for my “Four Seasons of Chairs” pattern. That gave me 8 of the colors I needed for my “Angel of Cross Stitch” pattern! I also got 9 more in the mail and that gave me 7 more for my angel! I am slowly getting them all! Another anonymous package came in the mail today with hoops and fabric. I am very grateful but I really wish I could thank them.
I also want to start a new project. I have come down to these 4 choices: 1) New Year's champagne bottle 2) "I'm stitching, Do not disturb" with a big hoop and fabric in the center and a tomato pincushion on it 3) A black lab or cocker angel Or…4) the flag with huge roses. 
I am so upset... I was just dropped from the Disney RR just because I forgot that it was only other overseas people and I usually don't send over seas, and because I need one color that my stores don't carry. I am so tired of all the cruelty in the world. I have dropped all my groups except Cozy, cross_stitching_designs and one for free patterns. I'm never joining anything again. I wonder if should give up on the faiy pattern? I don't even like angels or fairies. I just want to take part... I don't have any sympathy for anyone left. 
9th: I have decided to drop the fairy for now and work on my “Toy Shop”. I will need to calm down first of course, but I will put out progress reports on what happens. I cannot work when I’m stressed or I get off on my counting. I will never let these awful people stop me from doing what I love but I am so stressed when it comes to getting supplies. I have dropped all my groups because I don’t feel I need to answer to anyone on why I do what I do and how I do it. 
Also another thing, I have been drinking a lot of pop. I downed a case and a half of Mt. Dew in 5 days and I was sick for the next 4 days. I also ordered pizza because I needed a treat from all my stress. Bad idea! If I continue to have problems I will have to see a doctor and then I won’t get any stitching done because I will want to just sleep. I will let everyone know what happens with this. 
I read another 35 pages in The Stand by S. King today. I have not seen my book in weeks and it was very relaxing to sit and read. I have been achy from sitting at the computer all the time and laying flat really made my back feel better. There are 382 pages in the first “book” and I am on page 341. There are three “books”. The whole thing has 1,141 pages total. 
This morning I was so happy about starting another pattern. I was looking at patterns and decided to start on one of the 2 “Heart of Cross Stitch” Afghan pieces I found in an old issue of The Cross Stitcher’s magazine. I got a ways into it and discovered an error so I started back tracking. After I ripped that little bit out, I started looking at the rest of it. I discovered an error way back in the beginning, so I needed to rip out everything and start over. Well, to hell with that! Most patterns call for 2 strands. This one called for 4 and after it took me forever to tare out a small part, I was Not going to face ripping out everything (3 hours worth) I had done. Well, I started too and then that's when I discovered the tare in the fabric. I had to give up. The fabric was chopped in half and I'll have to use it for something else. It was a nice try though. I think I will have to find something without half stitches. They are such a pain to rip out when you make errors.

						   28th June Monday: I spent the day stitching my bookmark. I came to find that the colors were dark and the overall look is kind of drab. I got half of the bookmark done in about two hours. I am so disappointed as the darn thing keeps unraveling and there seems to be no way to fix it. I don’t think you can stitch it and glue would not work either. I was told bookmark covers so I will look for those. Then had company all night so I was not able to work on it anymore.
29th Tuesday: I spent all day listing everything I have to stitch and in what order I want to stitch it. I have 3-½ pages worth of patterns so I think I have all the patterns I need. I have a bout load of patterns coming and after that I am not going to get anything else. I am going to start a new project, as each old is finished. Again I had company so I missed out on several hours of stitching.
30th Wednesday: Today I ended up spending 8 hours looking for pictures on the net because a friends computer crashed and they lost all the pictures they had saved for their address label making. At the end of that my neck and shoulders hurt so bad that I could hardly move. Then I stitched some more on the bookmark while chatting.
At 2am I had a knock on my door. I opened it only a little to see that it was someone that I have seen at the bar before. He wanted to come “visit” me. He was drunk and I told him no he couldn’t come in. I used every excuse in the book, but he forced the door open on me and came in. 
I told him to leave and he wasn’t welcome here. He started trying to kiss me and I said no you have to leave. I finally reached for the phone and told him I would call the police if he didn’t leave. He didn’t leave so I started to dial and he hit me. I finished dialing and he was still trying to kiss me. I told him sorry but I have someone and I won’t cheat on him, and he hit me again. 
Twenty minutes later the police came knocking. He wouldn’t let e answer the door. He had forgotten that in his haste to get in the door wasn’t locked. So I started hollering for them to come in. He jumped up and started to fight with the cop. They took him away. He will be charged with intoxication, forced entry, attempted rape, and assault. I will have to go to court and I hope that he is put away for a long time. 
As you can imagine after that I was not able to do much of anything so I just pretty much sat there until I fell asleep. I hope to just pick up and keep going, but I am going back to never answering my door after dark. 
1st Thursday: I woke today with the neck and shoulder ache again. I was taking care of the neighbor’s dog and they were fighting all day so that didn’t help stress matters. I stitched as long as I could and then had to put it down. 
I got envelopes and plastic bags today for all my CS projects. I cannot believe all the extra stuff you need for CS when you are on the net. I cannot wait though. I have these things that I am working on now: 1) Fantasy SAL (Cozy) pattern and fabric from Pamela. Start date: July 1, un-started as of yet. 2) MSAL (Tracy) CSWF fabric I have. Theme: architecture. July 4. 3) Bookmark and magazine: fortheluvofxstitch, bookmark and fabric from: Maureen. Due July 22. 4) ANN Beginners RR 4 people (“S” monogram) fabric from DSL. 5) ANN General RR 4 people “Four Seasons of Chairs” fabric from DSL. 6) Disney RR: (Lornas), Nemo and other patterns/fabric from Jackie. Start date in August. Of course this is on top of my The Toy Shop, Bless This House, and I have an “x-mas” exchange starting soon. 
2nd Friday: I had a meeting at 1 and had to take the dog to the vet after that. I found out that he has staff infection and I will have to be stuffing pills down him for the next week. He does not take pills well. 
I spent the rest of the day doing my shopping and bill paying. I was able to get bobbins, needles and a few floss skeins. I also got three patterns from Janlynn. I was not able to get part of my mail out because they took the copy machine out of the post office. I don’t know where else to go to make copies.
Someone dropped by just after that and asked if I wanted to go to the store and I said yes, I forgot something. I looked high and low for bookmark covers and they didn’t even carry the bookmarks themselves. 
We also had a talk on how the guy at the bar found out where I lived. She has already told two people my address and telephone number. She claims she didn’t tell him but he would have no way of knowing other wise. I told her I hope she realizes that I could have been raped, beaten, or even killed. She still claims she didn’t tell him. 
Just as I got back from shopping and went to get on my computer it shut down. We had a power outage due to a breaker problem. It happened at 9pm and we banged on the maintenance mans door until he finally got up at 11:30 and flipped the breaker. He had to do it because the basement door was locked. 
As I was talking on the phone late, I heard a knock on the door. It was 2am, and you are right, it was the same guy. I didn’t even answer the door. I cannot believe he was stupid enough to come to my place again. 
3rd Saturday: I spent most of today catching up on DD and e-mails. I also did a little inventory and looked to see what I have as far as fabric for each thing I am doing and floss that I have out of the box for each project I am doing. My place is a mess with CS stuff everywhere. 
4th, Sunday: Happy Independence Day! I spent most of the first part of my day stitching and then was invited to cook out with my neighbors. Then stitched some more and was invited back for ice cream. I have finally finished the bookmark and I am so happy! 
Well, I was invited to go up to the bridge to see if we could see the fireworks but there weren’t any too see. They were rained out here. It was a good day for me anyway; I have completed my project and really hope that Maureen will like it!
