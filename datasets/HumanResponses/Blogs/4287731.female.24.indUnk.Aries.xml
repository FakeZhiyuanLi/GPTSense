      Just saw Garden State...it was so good. I really liked it.  In the Punch Drunk Love - Lost In Translation - Eternal Sunshine... vein...semi-realistic love stories of people who don't have it all together.  Solid dialogue, likeable protagonists, pine-worthy love/attraction.  It made me sad and made me laugh.  I start school tomorrow.  I didn't smoke today or yesterday, and no caffeine or sugar today.  Yuck, I ate so much yesterday that eating anything gross today would make me retch.  I'm going to try and make myself tired soon; I have to be at school for "professional development" tomorrow at 8.  I paid off my Mastercard today...only $800 left on my Discover.  Beautiful.

      Today I found it interesting that someone with whom I had spent the last 5 days straight did not call me.  I think we're both a little overwhelmed with each other.  I was told that he would do that by a very wise friend of mine, and she was right.  Boys are stupid, and girls are stupid, and I wish I were tired but I'm not.  I'm bored, and in about 5 weeks I'm going to pine for these days of languid boredom.  For now, I will whine that I am bored and that I need more structure in my life.  Said structure will commence in approximately 60 hours and counting.  Damn. p.s. I did not smoke today.  I ate some sugar, but not too much.  I hate having to keep track of this shit.

      I like that my titles all use stupid words that no one knows.  I think they make me look smart but they really look pretentious.  My room is clean, and that's good, but I haven't got anything good to say other than that.  Bye.

      So I drank too much coffee and so I'm trying to somehow enjoy my last week of freedom as much as possible.  In addition, I fear I've developed a few not-so-healthy addictions over the last four months, including but not limited to coffee, cigarettes, 7-11's generous selection of candy, the internet, and a certain boy.  I'm hoping I'll get them under control when I start teaching again.  A more regular schedule can do nothing but help me, right?   Today I realized that I'm in love with my best friend, a condition that is not likely to go away until I find someone else to take his place.  It's strange, I wouldn't have thought of him as my type, ever.  Regardless, I am unarguably in love...something I didn't think could happen a year ago and something that has become its own monster at this point.  Completely out of my control.  I wish I could turn it off, but I can't.  And the worst part is that I know him so well that I can picture the things he would say and do, how he would kiss me, how he would confess his love...it's most definitely pathetic and not a little frightening.  Unrequited love is the oldest story in the book, one of the ultimate stories, assuredly, but nonetheless heartbreaking when it's personal.   It never works out like it does in the movies either, with both people, the beautiful one and the dork, realizing they were meant for each other and falling into each other's arms.  Inevitably, it is more like the dork confesses, the beautiful one is flattered, they agree it can never work, their relationship is forever just a little awkward.  Which is why I've chosen not to confess at all.  And you don't know me, so you're going to say, "how will he ever know if you don't tell him? what if he feels the same way?"  I can tell you this: he doesn't.  If he did, I would know.  It sucks, and it hurts, but that's how it is.
