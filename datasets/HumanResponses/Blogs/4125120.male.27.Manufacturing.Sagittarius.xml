      i knew i would do this, start up something and pay attention to it for a couple days and then forget about it. maybe it's a sign of how dull my life is, i have nothing to blog about. what a boost to my self-esteem... i suppose i could write about how i didn't get the facility trainer position i wanted. but i've bitched about that enough in real life, don't really feel like doing it to a computer too. since no one will probably  ever  read this. could bitch about doing 3 jobs yesterday for the price of one, but i have to do that today too, so i suppose i'll hold off. could bitch about my soon-to-be-ex-wife or whatever the fuck she is (she filed for divorce, but due to her inaction, inadvertently dropped it) but that would take way too long.  i need a life.

      i have to go back to work tomorrow, after a week of sickness/vacation.  i'm really depressed.  but of course i should hear about the trainer position i want. should get an interview, if i don't, i think i'll quit. and of course the only reason i'm even writing this post is to avoid cleaning my apartment. and it needs it. and i seriously would be surprised if anyone ever reads this. this is more therapy than anything else.  oh well, guess i have to do something sometime. why does it have to be now?

        i am convinced that the ohio department of transportation  (or the equivilant)  is run by satan and inherently evil.  (i do not rule out the possibility that ALL of ohio is evil, but i'll stick to the dot for now.)  each year i drive down to cedar point  (from flint).  each year i attempt to take the same way. each year that attempt is foiled by some new plot. each year i get hopelessly lost in some town i don't know in OHIO. i'd love to get lost in say, oh, hawaii. but not ohio. and everything is dark where i get lost. everything's either closed or, well, there is nothing. so there is no asking for directions. and even the times i have a map, it does no good, cause i have no clue where i am now.  oh and keep in mind that since i have a bright yellow car with dark tinted windows  (read: cop magnet)  i was sticking to the speed limit and being a courteous driver, unlike the dozens of other michigan drivers that think 'turnpike' is a synonym for 'autobahn'  (it's not, in case you didn't know. well, if it is, there is at least a speed limit on the turnpike. yes, it's true! slow down and look!)   So any disdain directed at me for being a typical 'michigan driver' is, well, misdirected. most of the time.  this year was no different. apparently they don't know how to make temporary road signs in ohio. here in michigan, they are just as obvious, if not more so, then regular signs. in ohio, they consist of tiny things usually laying on the side of the road leaning on a couple of blocks of wood. detour signs are worse. again, in michigan, detours are obvious. not so in ohio. i was going from the turnpike to us-23 north, which involves going on 280 north,  (driving through a bridge is fun!) , then 75 south. For a michigan driver that is unnatural, we want to take north, but i know better. that leads to the maze that is detroit and certain doom.   (fyi. there is apparently no i-75 in detroit. it's all the lodge, or the fischer, or some other name that makes no sense to me, and i get lost once again, and being a white boy lost somewhere in detroit at 1 in the morning, not knowing if i am in a bad part of town or not is not my idea of a good time. therefore, in interest of self-preservation, i have learned to avoid the temptation to take 75 north)   but alas! the ramp to 75 south is closed! it says follow detour. okay, where is it? apparently on 75 north, cause that's the only way the road goes. occasionally we see a small sign, about the size of a dinner plate that says 75 south detour and an arrow. eventually these miniscule signs  (most michigan drivers, flying past at 80mph plus in a 65 zone, would never see them, even with an empty road)  lead me to an exit, and turn left onto a road. then, sudden darkness. no streetlights, detour signs or nothing. several other michigan license plates are well ahead of me, but i notice a sign almost immediately after turning - very dark, and most of the reflective stuff has come off - saying 75 south. not even sure if it had an arrow, but i realize that the ramp is directly to my left - just a moment too late. better then the other michigan people, they're a quarter mile ahead with no clue what has happened. a couple years ago, not realizing that the dot was evil, i would have driven on, figuring either there's a better way, or there would have been a detour sign, or that i would find another way.  not this time.  at this point i was fuming and whipped into a  (closed)  McD's parking lot  (the wrong way) (and very fast)  and turned around  (squealing tires)  and got on that ramp. meanwhile, the other michigan drivers, being typical michigan drivers, are driving 80 down a side street trying to find the detour. ha ha. they too, will learn. the rest of the trip, with the exception of the lightning  (lots of it)  in michigan, was uneventful. they  (dot)  tried to throw a few other shots my way, but they were half-hearted, and i knew how to defeat them now. and of course, when i hit the border, a few colorful words were thrown ohio's way.  and i matted the gas.  65 is way too slow.
