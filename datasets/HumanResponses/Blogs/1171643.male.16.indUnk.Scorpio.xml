      I'd just like to point out that Strauss'  The Blue Danube  is easily the best piece of classical music ever written.  I watched the beginning of 2001 yesterday...god how I love that movie, and the music of it.

      And now to start a quest of writing something at least remotely insightful--  I have learned the hard way that obsession leads to catastrophe.  Up until several years ago I was completely infatuated with one girl and had been since I was six or seven.  For some time, at least, early on in the obsession it was merely a childhood crush that was returned by her, but as time inexorably progressed my obsession grew as her crush declined, and then ended violently.  We reconciled and are now good friends, I hold no animousity toward her (and she presumably holds none to me;), but even then I had not realized that falling in love too early on, with no reason for it, no foundation, can only lead to future regret of past events that were handled with love behind the eyes experiencing them.  Being in love is a state of mind that forces amazing reactions to the simplest of things, out of the corner of an eye paragraphs can be thought of either why she is or is not looking toward me, why I should or should not flick my pupil to procure a clearer image, out of a fear of proving negative theories conclusive or positive ones incorrect.  I swore then, when that whole stage in my life had climaxed that I would never fall in love again unless that love was  really  returned.  Crushes, however, are never out of the question.  You know who you are;)  But I  think  that I have now learned my lesson.  A few months ago I started speaking to a girl that I held an attraction for, she was in a spanish class of mine (hablando espanol es dificil).  She seemed to hold one for me as well, I remember leading a conversation with a table that I sat at about nothing but science fiction, I would NOT let it swerve elsewhere, even though the girls that I sat with clearly wanted to move on to more kosher topics, excluding the one female that I am speaking of now.  For a week or two we seemed to hit it off, there was no physical adventure, however, because I soon realized that she clung to me like a starving victorian-era orphan.  Wherever I went she was there.  One night we spent three hours online exchanging pet names for each other.  I wanted to leave at the end of this, because it had grown to such boring proportions as cannot be expressed through words, but rather sighs.  I made this clear to her, and she proceeded to, for the better part of a minute type "no" into the chat interface.  I then concluded that she could no longer be my unofficial girlfriend.  I still went to go see a play of hers, of which she had I think only one line, and even managed to butcher the part of an extra, if that is possible....Anyway, I vowed to myself that I would commit to her, that she was pretty, and that she had a thing for me, which until then I hadn't really experienced.  However the vow didn't last long, about an hour later I took it back.    Over the course of the next few weeks I avoided her and any verbal communication with her.  I never logged into trillian.  It was all that I could do to "smother" the obsession that I knew she held for me, and it seemed to be working, until she asked me during a biology project if I wanted to mate with her (genetics, you know?).  I shook my head and lowered my eyes to the table--I am an awful liar--and said that I was too tired from mating with everyone else to do so.  It may have been a week later that she asked me if I had seen the new Star Trek movie, of which I of  course  had (and enjoyed!).  I merely murmured a pseudo no-grunt and proceeded to "get the hell out of there," since I happened to be alone with her in the biology classroom.  Later that day, in the computer lab, she was conferring with one of my better manfriends, who goes by the name of Jarrod (a person who will undoubtedly be mentioned further on this website).  Jarrod and I had seen the movie together the previous weekend.  Upon my entering the lab, he exclaimed something like "yeah, I saw it with Ian!  It was awesome!"    She doesn't appear to have spoken to me since then.  I think it worked.  Indirectly.  Being in the position of the person that is being obsessed over is easily as bad as being obsessed with someone else--it puts you in an uncomfortable situation, in fact a rather annoying one.  My philosophy on "women," if that's what you can call sixteen year old sophomores, has changed somewhat because of this.  I intend to just try and be that cooL funnY intelligenT assertivE guy, or a LYTE.  I do flirt all the time, I'm not sure if "they" flirt back, but the truth is that you never ever really know when it comes to the opposite sex.  I'm not content with flirting, but it is always extremely entertaining.    I don't want to cling to anyone, rather, I feel that when mutual love does happen, we should cling to each other.  Take care

      I had an idea for a statewide short story contest, about a guy who clones jesus.  I've written a few pages, of which this is the first paragraph--  The events of my life, when thought about, are causing my hands to shake at this very moment, and it is with some difficulty that I type these letters.  It is a hard thing to recall what I have done, by taking pills and going through years of rehabilitation I found only weeks ago that the memory of the awful events that I had created had passed, even though they themselves were almost a decade in age.  I don’t know what it was, but something triggered all of them to return in a nightmare last night, it could have been anything, given the circumstances, of which I will divulge immediately.  I’ve disposed of the medications, called all of my doctors and cancelled all of my appointments.  The apartment that I dwell in on government funds is my only life now; I lack any reason to venture back into reality.  I can live on my memories, and maybe some Dostoevsky.  Then we have Intertwine, my long-term project--  He dropped his sword, which was still wet with blood, and fell to his knees.  Tears stung his eyes and his lips widened only a little, then trembled.  He whimpered quietly, his head low, his insides straining and tightening with emotion.  One drop of water ran down his cheek and then froze there, the skin under it tightening with pain.  He slit the droplet off of his cheek and the pain doubled; a bead of blood replaced it and immediately solidified.  He looked up to the sky, into the churning bowels of Sauria, his eyes glimmering with tears, and he screamed, his hands rose to it, fingers widening.  He looked to his sword, picked it up and hurled it away, its loud ring and clatter echoing across the desolation.  He cried now, louder than he had in memory, his face in the lap of his hands, tears freezing on his face and on his gloved fingertips.  When moments had passed he looked back to the fort, to see the surviving men staring at him silently, their bodies silhouettes against the white of day, faces indiscernible.  and finally, Venator, another short story--  He spent the late hours of the night throwing himself at them, his axe hacking through their limbs, its blade drenched in their entrails and their bodily fluids.  Their guns bucked and screamed at him, he split them apart, their swords rose and swung at him, he shattered their metal, their shields rose to defend themselves, and he kicked them away with his foot, to leave his axe embedded in their necks, before it would be withdrawn to strike again and sever another piece of flesh from another body.  Until daytime Venator killed, and he followed the last survivor of the Barbin platoon as he fled to the top of a tall dune, the morning sun casting a corona atop its peak, and leaving the man’s body nothing more than a mere silhouette.  The soldier was skilled, obviously, and he held a single pistol, which he bravely discharged at Venator, who merely swung his head to the side, the bullet swishing the air about his ear.  With a widened look in his eye the man turned to flee down the other side of the dune, but Venator’s axe found him first, the blade hurled from a great distance, its soaked surface digging into his spine.  The soldier gasped and lost all control of his body, with his nerves being cut like strands of spider silk.    None have been fully edited.

      I have begun with a beginning.  After some searching around I discovered that instead of having a normal website that I'd rather just have a blog, which seems cool nonetheless.  Hopefully I can think of something to post here other than an introduction to myself, of which I will construct now.    I go by the name of Pollux V on my favorite and most visited website: www.sciforums.com, and am known as Ian or my last name by my various friends and cohorts in a High School near the area of Acadia National Park, a place that tends to be a "gorgeousity" in the summer but more of a depressing wasteland in the wintertime.  Pollux V is an odd name, I came up with the idea after remembering this old Star Trek game I played when I was just a wee lad of ten or eleven (I am currently 15).  It's this planetary system on a star chart that you have to go to immediately after starting a new game.  It's a real star as well, I'm sure you can find many awe-encompassing pictures of it with a google search.  Hopefully the system has at least five planets, and hopefully the fifth is of some importance.  My  real  name is Ian and was actually going to be Tim but was changed by my parents upon my delivery, I think...but am not sure.  It's not that important anyway, is it?  My interests include sociology, writing, philosophy, astronomy, and greater science that does not involve merely letters, numbers attached to them or lines connecting them together (a subtle reference to the noble arts of chemistry and thaumaturgy).  I plan to be a writer of some sort when I "grow up."  I don't know what that necessarily implies, maybe it's merely a state of mind, but it's probably some time after I turn either eighteen or twenty one.  I guess only "grownups" know.  It would be nice for what I write to be succesful, however writing isn't something that I necessarily do for profit or for gain: I do it for myself.  It's somewhat of an addiction, a parasite of having too much time on my hands.  If I had a choice between breath or an ability to write, and would lose one if I picked the other, then I would choose writing, because without it I would be dead anyway.  I've had a keen interest in politics and the media for going on a year now, thanks to an insightful class or two I've taken at my High School.  Although I have no doubt that you can easily tell that I am of the extremely comedic nature, I just want to reassure our blind viewers that I  am  [comedic].  Just thought I'd mention that.    Sciforums (www.sciforums.com) is arguably the most influential place online or in the real world that I have ever had the pleasure to be a part of.  I believe that I've been a member for about two years, and have learned more than can be expressed with words or handshakes from the members and the content that resides there.  I happen to be the co-moderator of the scifi section (even though I do all the work=P)  When it comes to writing or reading, I will always prefer the genres of science fiction and fantasy, because I've found that I carry a huge deal of respect for authors that can not only create a plausible world for unique characters to exist in but who can also write it well and make it  interesting .  To me, accomplishing such a feat goes far beyond normal (modern) fiction, which I do also enjoy, but in my opinion, could never hold a candle to fantasy.  This excludes the "classics," which I do not think need to be listed.  Some of them are fantasy works anyway.  My political views are liberal, as you might expect from a youngin like myself.  I feel that our current president is  at least  indirectly responsible or directly responsible for the destruction of the World Trade Center, that there are too many political and historical advantages that go along with genocide and mass destruction to be ignored.  After this event George W. Bush went from mediocre president to mythological hero through the engineering of his own propaganda, and hate of the United States grew across the world, as if the blood from the victims from 9/11 was rain to a field of plants.  The directions that our nation has taken are just not acceptable to myself, and hopefully if you disagree with me (whomever you are) we can have a nice argument or two via msn messanger (use my email: shrike116@hotmail.com) or sciforums.  I plan to...expand upon this later.  Hopefully this primer to the Illustrious Pollux V and also Ian will serve to garner more interest in this blog.  Thanks for reading, and make sure to cut down on your pornography.  I mean, come on, it's fun and all once or twice a day, but six times is really pushing it and your time could definitely be spent more constructively.  Why don't you go to the beach and build a sand castle.  Yes, a sand castle.  En espanol?  Castillo de arena.  Heheheh....  Take Care  --Ian

      I just spent my night writing this.  I need to send something off to a magazine.  This is the first draft.  SHIP’S LOG 	14:25 	5-16-23 	[BEGIN ENTRY] I just cannot get enough of this zero g.  It’s going to be a few more hours before the rest of the crew get the artificial stuff working, and since I have no technical knowledge of this spacecraft I have delegated my time to studying the acrobatics one can perform while without an anchor to the ground.  I left the NASA Wheel about a day ago with my two crew companions; I had spent about a week there after lifting off from Cape Canaveral on a beautiful Friday morning.  I managed to get a vid of it from the ground, it was incredible.  Watching a transport’s blue tail pass through a thin veil of sun-scarred clouds has made me feel like a bit of a poet, rather than “the scientist” as I’m sure my fellows refer to me as.  The Wheel itself was fairly boring, the people there seemed depressed beyond what I could have expected.  I mean, I had heard rumors, but, still…it almost seemed as if each one was on the verge of tears, because they had been confined there for several months and had to watch as astronauts and scientists like myself departed for various locations around the solar system.  At one point I tried to watch an old, roman-epic movie but found that the base’s library contained only pornographic films.  Five hundred terabytes of storage and not a pixel devoted to reality.  What a shame. 	I’m enjoying the time spent away from my wife.  Who I hate.  If my avid reader cares. 	So, anyway, our mission is a simple survey of the sun’s surface, one that should take only a few months.  I don’t intend to use this log much; I have a great deal of work to get to from the sensor readouts.  If I have time, however, I will be sure to inform my nonexistent avid reader of the various excitements of my voyage to the sun. [END ENTRY]  10:15 5-30-23 [BEGIN ENTRY] 	Earth looked absolutely ravishing the day I left, and steadily it shrunk into just a ball of light.  We have to keep the windows facing the sun shut and wouldn’t be able to look outside of them anyway (the sun tends to blind humans mercilessly), so I’m left with nothing but a chasm of faint stars to look at.  Sometimes I feel like downloading the latest movie or television shows but lately I’ve just been sleeping or going through the sensor reports, which, for some reason, I find amazingly enthralling even though they tend to consist of little more than numbers and dashes.  Nothing the ship has picked up has been unusual.  However I’ve been feeling a sense of secrecy permeating the confined air of this place, questions regarding the sun itself are briefly answered and then tend to degenerate into a “how’s the wife” typical conversation.  And, in addition to it all, this mission must have been enormously expensive for the UN, I have no idea why they would want to send us on a task such as this one that could be handled (from a safe distance) just as easily by the hundreds of satellites we have scattered throughout the solar system.   	My crewmembers, Nelson and Tyler, both middle-aged and underpaid astronauts, are polite but just don’t enjoy my company.  Whenever I arrive in the “living room” and find them both conversing they immediately stop and shift the subject.  I guess I just never believed those stories about animosity from astronauts toward scientists, almost like the prevalent racism of mid twentieth century America.  I’m sure they must have some slur they refer to me as behind my back, but I don’t really want to get to the bottom of it.   	I’m starting to think that the only good thing about this mission is that I’m as far away as I can possibly be from my wife.  God, how I loathe her… [END ENTRY]  09:38 6-02-23 [BEGIN ENTRY] 	We’ve passed through an outer-atmosphere of radiation, rendering our communication with Earth impossible.  I couldn’t be happier.  I don’t have to send any more letters to my wife, nor do I have to read the ones she sends to me.  A few hours ago the radar picked up an object just a few miles away, extremely close space-wise, it was an asteroid or comet of some sort that NORAD hadn’t mapped out during the stellar cartography missions of the fifties.  It seems to have disintegrated, it must have been made of ice, but we’re all still on edge.  I try not to speak to my crewmates.  I’m starting to develop a relationship with them similar to the one I wish I’d have with my wife: One with no verbal communication. [END ENTRY]   11:50 6-02-23 [BEGIN ENTRY] 	Christ almighty, something just hit us, Nelson and Tyler are freaking out.  The ship is spinning like it’s a mary-go-round and we can’t close all of the windows for some reason so the sun blasts us with light every other twenty seconds.  According to the instruments we’re losing oxygen fast, we already don’t have enough to get back to Earth.  They’re looking for the hole right now, but because of the heat outside they can’t do an EVA, so it isn’t likely that they’ll be able to patch it up.  I can’t stop sweating or shaking, it’s getting to be somewhat of a challenge to type these letters.  Maybe I should switch to verbal, but then I’d just stutter.  I really don’t know about this.  It could be it.  For me.  What the hell are we going to do?  We don’t have enough oxygen…we’re out of contact with Earth…and every twenty seconds we can’t see a damn thing with our own eyes…Christ almighty…what am I going to do? [END ENTRY]  17:10 6-03-23 [BEGIN ENTRY] 	Tyler managed to find the hole and cover it up with some metal from the pantry that he welded on.  We have four more days of oxygen.  I’ve spent as much time away from the crew as possible, luckily the sensors are still doing fine, even though we haven’t stopped spinning.  The readings haven’t changed a great deal, but, oddly enough, the fact that they have changed is cause for some concern on my part.  Nelson managed to at least keep the ship from spinning any faster, which is good, because if it were to increase in speed we might all be permanently blinded.  The sun would be on every side of the ship at once, in our eyes, splitting our heads open with luminous intensity.   [END ENTRY]  19:15 6-03-23 [BEGIN ENTRY] 	I’ve done some calculations.  One of us would be able to make it back if…if the other two weren’t around.  Even with the sensor readouts, which have been just going insane, I still can’t stop thinking about the deadline four days from now, when we’ll all just suffocate to death. [END ENTRY]  23:27 6-03-23 [BEGIN ENTRY] 	I walked into the living room to get some food and noticed that Tyler and Nelson were just staring at each other.  Viciously.  There was total contempt for one another in their eyes, their muscles were tense, sweat beads ran down their foreheads.  Their gray hair shined each time the sun blasted us.  Something’s going to give.  I managed to sneak one of the knives back to my cabin; I may bolt the door or lock it somehow, if I can. [END ENTRY]  02:13 6-04-23 [BEGIN ENTRY] 	They’re screaming and banging on my door right now, shouting profanities, using those slurs that I mentioned a few days ago.  I had just locked the door and braced it with my computer hard drive when they started bashing on it and demanding that I come out.  There’s no way that I’m leaving here.  No way.  I haven’t answered them once, I’ve tried to not make any noise…wait a second…they stopped, they’re listening…I shouldn’t be typing, but—but it helps, somehow, makes me feel like I’m not alone nine AU’s from the Earth with no radio contact.  I have to stop, now, I have to, I know they can hear me. [END ENTRY]   02:45 6-04-23 [BEGIN ENTRY] 	There was just a scream, I think it was Nelson.  My god…he’s out there…Jesus…he’s out there right now.  Nelson’s body, I can see it every few seconds, it’s disintegrating outside, his skin is clinging to his bones, I can see the skull beneath his face, I can’t turn away, I’m touch typing right now…it looks like he has a stab wound to the chest, but I can’t tell, I only get to see him for a second, then the sun flashes, then I see him again, almost like the frames of those old analog movies.  At least, this way, we have a week of oxygen left.  That’ll put us within visible range of Earth.  At least, if I die, I’ll get a last look at my homeworld. [END ENTRY]  05:03 6-05-23 [BEGIN ENTRY] 	I have to get food.  I’m famished.  I’m going to confront Tyler.  I’m not leaving without the knife. [END ENTRY]  07:15 6-05-23 [BEGIN ENTRY] 	As soon as I left my cabin he came at me, tore open my left shoulder, Christ, it hurts.  The man was easily twice my size, so I ran from him, shut all the doors behind me and turned off the gravity.  I came back at him, with my mastery of zero g from screwing around all those days before.  I slit his throat, blood just gushed everywhere.  It’s on my hands right now, but I can’t tell if it’s my own or his.  He choked on it, gasped and coughed, eyes widened and then faded as life left them.  I jettisoned him just a second ago, and am enjoying a roast beef sandwich.  It’s pretty good. [END ENTRY]  08:15 6-06-23 [BEGIN ENTRY] 	I can’t get the gravity back.  I don’t care.  I have no idea how to control this thing; there must be a thousand three-to-eight-letter acronyms, one for each button in the cockpit.  The ship doesn’t come with a manual; I’ve got to hope that Tyler left it on autopilot.  I’ve showered four times and can’t get any of the blood off of my body, even though my shoulder seems to have stopped bleeding.  The sensors have gone totally berserk; I’m starting to think that there is something amiss within the core of our sun; I can’t quite get to the bottom of it.  There may just be a solar storm brewing down there, or it might be getting ready to go nova prematurely.  I don’t know.  I need more time.  There’s blood everywhere.  I’ve tried to wash it away, but the ship just won’t stay clean.  The sun itself is giving me a constant headache; I think I may be losing my eyesight as well.  I can’t sleep, because of how bright it gets.  Even though I’ve showered four times I look like I just walked out of a Chewbacca-look-alike contest. [END ENTRY]  11:49 6-10-23 [BEGIN VERBAL ENTRY] It’s been near impossible to get things back up and running when you can’t see anymore, but I’ve managed to do it.  The ship reads the data aloud to me, now.  I think I’ve got a general idea as to what’s happening in the core.  For whatever reason, the fusion cycle has been slowing down and speeding up, and the process has been accelerating exponentially.  If my eyes worked, I bet I’d be able to see the sun flashing, I also bet the kind folks back on Earth and the solar system abroad can see it as well.  Anyway, this means that sooner or later something is going to explode, there’s going to be a huge burst of heat and/or energy.  It may be enough to incinerate the planets; it may only be enough to raise the temperature by a few degrees for a few hours.  I just don’t know, and I’m not sure that I can know until it happens.   From the looks of it, I’m on my way back to Earth, but am really not sure.  I don’t know how I’m going to explain the deaths of two fellow crewmembers to NASA.  I may have to edit or delete this log.  I could just say that they fought each other and both threw themselves out into space.  But they wouldn’t believe that.  I’m just a scientist.  Not an astronaut.  Not a politician.  Not a businessman.  Not a liar.  I can’t lie.  They’d see it in a second, I’d break down…plus, they’d never believe me, with this blood everywhere.  I hate my wife.  I wish she were here right now, her voice has been running through my head like there’s no tomorrow, even though I can’t see, I’d enjoy hearing her scream, I’d enjoy feeling my hands tear open her throat, that’d stop the nagging.  The stupid bitch can go to hell; it might be more comfortable than where I am right now. [END ENTRY]  --date malfunction— [BEGIN VERBAL ENTRY] She’s here.  I don’t know how.  She won’t leave me alone.  The blood is seeping from the walls.  I can’t see it.  I can smell it.  Shut up, shut your mouth you whore, leave me alone…god, someone help me, anyone, help me, please…oh just leave me alone, get away, stay the hell away from me…only a few more hours until radio contact with Earth…only a few more hours…but do I want to do it, they might find out, they might find me guilty before I even get back, then they’d shoot me down with a missile…but then, there might not even be an Earth left to get back do…no I don’t care about my shirt color…god…be quiet… [END ENTRY]  --date malfunction— [BEGIN VERBAL ENTRY] The ship started shaking a few seconds ago, it’s really shaking now, I think I can hear it falling apart, the blood, the blood is everywhere—I think I can see again!  It is terrible, my god, the ship, it’s like a nightmare, the blood, the knives, Tyler and Nelson have joined my wife in screaming at me and threatening me, I don’t know how.  It’s shaking more now, the portholes look like they’re surrounded by some kind of inferno, I’m going to have a look. 	Yes, I don’t know how I’m alive, or how the ship is in one piece, but there’s a firestorm around the hull right this second, it looks like a thousand erupting comet tails and solar flares, just steaming by.  It’s stopped shaking.  I can see Earth now.  I haven’t contacted them.  They haven’t contacted me.  I can see through the inferno.  My god, it’s—it’s frying the surface, the planet is turning black, now it’s falling apart, disintegrating, no more than a cloud of dust, oh, my, my, my… [END ENTRY]  --date malfunction— [BEGIN VERBAL ENTRY] 	I have been unable to make contact with anyone, I had hoped that somewhere in the solar system someone else was still alive, but it looks as if the entire place has been reduced to some kind of primordial soup.  I can’t move my arms anymore, I don’t know why, I can hardly move at all, it might be all the radiation, getting to my brain, it’s becoming harder to speak…I don’t even have the luxury to commit suicide.  Nelson, stay back— [END ENTRY]

      Well, yesterday I managed to finish the second draft of Venator, it's eighteen pages long.  Maybe I'll post it here, but, yeah, that's a bit of length.  I can't say I feel like writing much, I'm tired even though I still have some chores to do.  I spent my day out of school eating mexican food and then fleeing from snow plows.  It's cold here.  And it's snowing quite a lot, or it was.  But we didn't get the day off.  It was fun.  My toe hurts.  Beh...

       Winter   They came from the sky.  Their ships, lights among stars, were drawn to the glowing effulgence of Earth, like fireflies to a lamp.  Within the shadows of skyscrapers, as the sun rose, they came, as if they had always been another bastion of humanity, another piece of their culture that had been assembled along with everything else thousands of years before.  They were both humanoid and bipedal, an evolutionary coincidence that helped immeasurably, although their skin texture and color harkened one to the memory of wet, verdant plants within lush borders of rainforests.  Their bodies were, on average, slightly taller than most men and their heads, although proportionately normal, appeared to have been influenced by the ovular characteristics of the almond.  They were different.  They were new.  They were alien.  And, with the billowing of a west wind the denizens of Manhattan suddenly found themselves walking shoulder to shoulder with them.  Not one of the denizens did not recoil in terror; whole crowds would fly away from them as if they themselves were the shockwaves of atomic explosions.  Not one of the denizens did not find themselves lacking in breath, for here, the very pinnacle of what was fictitious stood, and it was real.  It was tangible, and no longer of the imagination.  The great rivers of cars found themselves dammed and were silent, the reflective canyon walls of the city were silent, and only the screeching of overhead jet engines could be heard.  The people were frozen against their buildings, their eyes wide and unblinking, pupils taking in what was before them, and what was before them standing quietly, their wide, dark eyes peering at the humans they had predicted would react exactly as so.  One of them focused his eyes upon a single adult in a business suit.  “What is your name?”  The green thing asked, its melodious voice bouncing back and forth along the skyscraper walls.  The adult, a thin woman with dark hair found herself devouring the oxygen around her body in order to stammer a reply.  Thirty seconds must have passed before she had composed herself, and for all of the witnesses those seconds were full of eager agony.  “Sarah,” she managed to say.  The thing’s mouth widened in a slight smile, one that radiated appreciation and compassion among the witnesses of it.  “You have a nice name, Sarah.  I’m Rupert.  Where do you come from?”  “59th Street,” she quickly replied, her face making an unsuccessful effort to return the grin.  Rupert pointed a long finger, trailed by a long arm to the sky.  “I’m from there.”  “So I figured,” she said, easier now.  “Is this New York City?”  He asked, his voice calming her and the people around her further.  “Yeah, you’re in Manhattan.”  His head scanned the buildings; his eyes roamed their mercury glass and their mesmerizing structures.  The rotors of a news helicopter began to echo down their canyon.  Like leaves shook from heaven, the clouds that had basked in the sky had now been swept away by the faint and prophetic west wind.  “Reminds me of home,” he murmured, his eyes returning to hers.  “Do you know why I am here, why we are here, Sarah?”  She shook her head.  “I couldn’t begin to guess.”  Rupert’s eyes now flicked to the crowd that had assembled around him, and he turned to face them all.  “Get ready,” he said, still smiling, “I have a bit of a speech to make.  His voice grew gray, the forest of the city trembled with it.  “Since we detected the first signals of your radio broadcasts we have held an interest in your society, in your culture, and in your history.  Over the course of many decades we have watched as you came closer and closer to destroying yourselves, through both a technology and the complete lack of its mature use.  About four decades ago we almost did what we are doing now, we almost intervened for your own safety, but we found that the situation managed to solve itself.  We had faith in you then, but steadily that faith in the leader of your world, the United States, has declined significantly.  “The problems are not just with the government of the United States, but with its culture, and with all of the problems that it causes to those that are not within its borders.  Weak leadership in the upper society is to blame for this, petty greed and deceit has lead to the suffering of countless peoples across the world.  This greed has reached such a state as to warrant intervention from the outside: from us.  Because we cannot watch this suffering go on, because we cannot watch as you destroy both the world and yourselves, we will begin, with or without your permission, a process in every corner of the world to bring mankind into a new age, not a utopia, not a paradise, but one of peace and harmony with each other.”  “What are you going to do?”  shouted a random man from the crowd.  “We have several, simple rules that are to be followed.  One—for as long as there is a starving human being among your population, every person on Earth will be unable to ingest food or water at their own health’s expense.  Two—for every person, civilian or military killed in a war, three people will be killed that have had something to do directly with their death.  Three—every atomic warhead not disassembled in one year’s time will be detonated over the most populous cities on the planet.  Four—purposeful violation of any of these rules will result in a stripping of all wealth and social status.  The whole of humanity has two months before these rules are put into effect.  There will be no exceptions to any of these statements.  That is all—”  “Why are you doing this?” screamed the same, random man, “are you insane?  There is no purpose!  Are you not human?  Do thorns not make you bleed?”  “Humanity,” replied Rupert, “has become inhumane.”  And, as if they had never been there at all, Rupert, and the other aliens in New York City and every other city in the world disappeared and were not heard from again.  -------   One year to the day later, Rupert and his fellows were standing in one of their great ships, with Earth, a blue globule of life sitting in the distance among a sea of lidless stars.  They watched through their great domes of glass as a series of bright flashes spread across the world, as bubbles of white expanded and then faded away as quickly as they had come.  The process accelerated, now, as each continent drenched itself in the blinding blossoms of divided atomic nuclei.  Many hours passed, the crescent of light from the sun shifted, and finally the explosions ceased.  The atmosphere had grayed and darkened, nothing could be seen through the thick layer of radioactive cloud.  The effulgence that had drawn them here had faded and was now completely gone.  Rupert shook his head, a thing he had learned from the videos he had watched in preparation for his meeting the humans.  “I wonder, now, is it such a terrible thing that I have done?”    His eyes roamed the cold fog that shrouded the Earth.  “In death, in nuclear winter, can spring not be far behind?”   This story was inspired by the poem  urlLink An Ode to the West Wind  By Percy Bysshe Shelley.  References to the poem are throughout  Winter .  Please, email me with your comments, or, p/m me via sciforums.

      Only a few hours ago I finished the first three books of "Isaac Asimov's Greatest Achievement!"--Foundation.  The series as a whole is a serious contender for my favorite group of scifi books of all time, among Clarke's 2001 series and Herbert's Dune series.  I saw that someone mentioned David Brinn as a scifi writer on the same footing as Clarke and Asimov.  I seriously disagree.  After finishing this I've decided to start up the plot of a science fiction series, hopefully one merely inspired but not a duplicate of Foundation.  I'm going to try to commit myself to getting the background history of Intertwine's cultures fleshed out as well, so far I've only a tenth of what I need.  I've found that to have a succesful universe, a complete history is required, one that I can reference whenever I need to, so that is now my mission to finish, maybe by this week or the next.  I'm going to get a book on making blogs from amazon, as well as a few more of those Foundation phenoms...

      An essay I've written for a social studies class, one that I really enjoyed writing.  A note: this is not my true opinion of mankind.  We had two choices--argue that he is flawed or that he isn't.  I felt that writing about mankind being perfect would be a great deal more fun than imperfect, because it creates such a helpless dream of man, one of a ruthless and invulnerable creature with the infinite power to bend the universe to his will.  Take care.  Is mankind fundamentally flawed?						  If god created everything, then surely his greatest and most coveted creation was man.  Mankind is perfect.  Man is the pinnacle of creation, from the beginning; from the first binding proteins to his simian ancestors man has been the one goal of everything.  Creation, life and death were meant to contribute to a future being who would be omnipotent among his fellow creatures.  Man is this being, a fruit of the toils that trillions of predecessors have died over and evolved to create.  Man is the only organism that can, with the power of his intellect, destroy whole worlds, enslave, drive to extinction, or multiply whole species, for whatever purpose he deems necessary to accomplishing his singular goal of omnipotence.  He has spread about every atom of land on his homeworld and has been patiently looking outward to the stars, for more places to conquer, to overcome, to bend to his will through wielding the power of his immense intellectual superiority.  The world is man’s slave; therefore, every fellow living creature in the world is a hostage of man.  Man has had the power for many decades now to reduce the world to a radioactive inferno incapable of supporting life for thousands of years.  “The five established nuclear powers - the United States, Russia, China, France and Britain - possess enough nuclear warheads to obliterate the world many times over.”1 This gives mankind as a whole the ability to wipe the world clean of the stench of life, of non-omnipotence.  There is no being that can stand in man’s way, there is no being that can escape a nuclear purge, one that could only be sent forth from the magic of mankind.   For many thousands of years there have been several species that have been domesticated by man, that have been taken from their habitats by man to serve man.  These creatures include the cow, for milk and meat, the pig, for meat, the chicken, for meat, and many others—all of them serving his colossus, all of them totally dependent on man for his nourishment.  Each cow, each pig is bred to live a life of enslavement until a quick end, where their insides and skins will be purified and then devoured without a second thought by the billions of pinnacles of creation.  Nonhumans are helpless.  Compared to the fates of other creatures, however, this measure of permanent enslavement is merciful.  Few species have been eliminated entirely by mankind, a great deal; however, have been driven to the periphery of extinction.  “More people require more space to live in and more natural resources, such as land to farm or build on.  Other organisms have to compete with people for space and natural resources.  People usually win.”2 Nothing stands in man’s way; nothing can defeat man.  “Scientists recognize what they call a ‘background extinction rate.’ This is the rate at which species go extinct naturally—without any help from humans. But species are currently going extinct at about 1,000 times the background rate, largely because of a growing human population. Humans can threaten plants and animals in a number of ways.”3 The stench of life, of non-humanity, of non-omnipotence, is disappearing now, as the race of man forges the way to a time where any species that is not necessary to man’s survival will be nonexistent.    The species of man is perfect.  Undeniably perfect.  No other organism has ever achieved what it has, no other organism has superceded what nature intended for it to do—that is, to conquer and overcome the challenges of other threats and other dangers.  It is the perfect species in that it is more successful than any organism before it, that it holds every organism living on earth as its own hostage, with extinction or enslavement choices that mankind alone will delegate.  Mankind’s omnipotence cannot be matched; his control cannot be duplicated by other species.  To have absolute control over everything is to be god.  Therefore they are gods, and therefore they are perfect.

      I posted a  urlLink thread  on sciforums about what you'd make your country's national anthem be, I chose the Blue Danube of course, which is mentioned further down, but anyway a few people recommended "Mars: The Bringer of War" by Holst, I downloaded it via Kazaa, which is just awesome.  If you don't have Kazaa, and consider yourself to be even the slightest "music person" then, well, you aren't.  But it's just an awesome song.  Perfect for science fiction movies and for writing inspiration of any sort.    So far I've written a few more pages of Intertwine, which brings the tally up to 27, of the third draft.  There must be over five hundred pages, though, of text that is related in one way or another to the story.  I think I'm going to take a break and maybe write up some more of their history, maybe I'll find time to get my digital camera set up again so I can post the fifth or sixth map draft I'm almost done with.  I'm planning to go to the YMCA to work out, then do some homework.  My day is going to be of the very exciting sort.  My brain may just be overwhelmed and explode.  Homework needs to have a synonym or two... urlLink    I've been thinking lately of my favorite class, Honors World Studies, which was advertised as going through the various epochs of history, but it seems now that the whole thing is just a more in-depth philosophy class (I took one last quarter, which was as of now a week ago).  Don't get me wrong, the philosophy is interesting and it's fun to debate and argue and play  urlLink devil's advocate , but I want to learn more about  history .  I think my mind only has the real shell of what has occured on this planet, I barely know of everything and only know somethings in depth, and even that claim is contestable.  I'm talking about  urlLink human  history (Bosch is the shit).  Before that, there's a bit of knowledge here and there, up until the dinosaurs, then there's nothing at all.    It seems like I'm one of the few people in that class that speak at all, it's usually divided between myself, my friend, Jarrod, and my female arch nemesis, with others speaking every now and then.  It gets to be annoying, because the class just falls silent after the teacher asks a question, leaving me to wait fifteen or twenty seconds before I shout the opposite of what a "normal" person would say, whether or not I can back the claim up.  About a third of the room is occupied by gorgeous, gorgeous sophomores, who hardly speak at all.  I have no doubt that each of them has something to add, some undoubtedly more than others.  I'd enjoy interacting with them more than just pretending not to bask in their quintessential extravagance.  I think that means that I try not to stare, and that I'd rather argue and joke, like people, rather than  urlLink mannequins and their silent onlookers.

      What happened today?  I woke up, and felt an extreme urge to stay home.  But I did not act on it, I stood up, held by breath and flexed my muscles while chanting propaganda slogans.  I marched into the shower, washed my hair with all the determination of a Columbian Freedom Fighter, ate, and went to school.  I was pumped.  I was ready for anything. Then I went to World Studies and hunkered down to some research before I wrote the beginning of an AWESOME script, I only got through a short discussion between Jupiter and Mars, but, hey, you gotta work with what you have...  Life went on.  The bell rang.  I got my chocolate milk.  I went to my locker.  I hung out with my friends, then went to art class, and critiqued various pieces of, you guessed it: art. My opinion was, of course, the most valuable.  I managed to reduce a few hopefuls to tears, some of them sad, others insane with joy at my praise, I could almost see their tails wagging and their tongues flapping outside of their mouths.  My piece, of course, recieved a standing ovation for over ten minutes, during which time I bowed in three separate directions.  I had people begging for my autograph and kissing my feet as I strolled back into the brutality of the hallways, into the brutality of reality.  In case you have not already guessed, my sarcasm seems to have gotten the best of me.  Just had a thought.  "Brutality of Reality" would make a great album name for any punk band.  So then I went to math class, I played by best chauvenist, cracked a few jokes, played a funky game.  No worries, mate.  Went to lunch, had a banana thrown at me.  A friend of mine told two stories, one about a small girl that was humped (and splooged upon) by a large dog, and the other about an Episcopalian who quit her job in tears because he said "goddamnit" three or four times in the space of five minutes.  Some of the funniest things I've heard.  Ever.  I wanted to throw the bananna back.  I did hurl a noodle but it missed.  So I just placed it on the floor.  I went to wellness.  We made muffins.  How special of us.  I'm so proud of myself I could vomit.  I'm not really a muffin kind of guy, so I didn't have any.  On the busride home I managed to fulfill a dream of mine that's been going for two days now.  I wrote "Thus Sprach Zarathustra" on a girl's arm.  Five minutes later she wrote "timshel" on mine, which apparently means something like "you can choose your life" in Hebrew, or something to that effect. Can you see the opening seen of a sick porn movie developing here?  The rest of my day was not eventful--I watched some Star Wars--and that's it.  I tried to write some more of Myriad, but didn't get far, so I'm working on Intertwine.  Tell me those titles aren't cool.  Come on.  Take yer best shot.  I've got a bullet proof vest wrought of ego.

      Some time has passed.  I've thoroughly enjoyed checking out those websites.  But I feel like writing some kind of an essay, even though I've only twenty minutes left online.  But what to speak of...what to discuss.  The impact of the internet?  The epiphany of my assholiness, which I have already mentioned?  No, no, friend, and fellow reader, these topics are far too weak to speak of in an environment such as this!  For, without environments, are we not existent?  Bloodyell.  Can't think of a damn thing.  Hang on...it's coming...it's coming...here it is!!!  Language.  Christ almighty, Buddha-we-idolize-you, Abraham above, and, okay I'll stop--I love language!  Such a topic might seem boring to the less worthy, but, as their self-imposed title suggests, they are not worthy of being interested.  I think of language constantly, the evolution of english, its impacts on the world, the arabic and latin and german et cetera influences on what I am writing now.  How I love it!  I wrote a damn good paper on the subject, fifteen pages in all (it was a long term project), learned a hellofa lot.  I'm in a funky writing class, which is cool, I'm only really getting constructive criticism from my teacher, everyone else just adores my prose.  She seems to have the opinion that less is more, and on the whole, when it comes to writing normal, non fantastic fiction, I would agree.  But what I do write and love to write--scifi and fantasy, requires a language that is just incredible and amazing, akin to Beowulf (read the Heaney translation), to the Lord of the Rings, et al.  Without the language and without the imagination behind it then we would have nothing but the mundane comings and goings of fiction.  I just should mention that I think I have a long ways to go as a writer, but that if I were to attempt to write "the great american novel" I would either accomplish or come pretty f*cking close to accomplishing such a feat.  Why don't I?  I can't say I know.  Maybe I will.  I cannot see a life led in this body that will not be spent pouring over letters and documents.  Whether succesful or not, I'm going to write until I'm dead, and I'm never going to stop doing so.  It's an addiction, a healthy addiction--a need to express thoughts and ideas that I have and cannot quell and will never be able to smother.  I feel that if I were to suddenly become a mute quadripalegic that my brain would explode.  If I do not put down my thoughts and do not commit my time to writing or developing stories then I go insane.  What a tragic life, eh?

      I've been viewing the various websites and people connected with that blog that is mentioned in the next post downward.  They seem fairly cool.  I emailed one of them, maybe she'll reply, then, maybe not.  Yep.  I'm checking out the "funny jewish girl" website.  Heheh...you know what's funny?  I'm a funny half-jewish boy!  Hybrids are better anyway!  I can worship and despise Jesus at the same time!  What a deal!  I think it'd be cooler if I were a quarter arabic, jewish, christianish, and buddhist.  AND maybe some aboriginal-cannibalistic genes thrown in for flavor.  Because, come on, everything always comes down to flavor.

      I've decided to come here and update more often, because I just read some of a really cool  urlLink blog , and, well I became inspired, you might say.  So I guess I'll just go through my day-to-day events.  The big letdown of the week appears to have been my loss of the possibility of a date with a person I had a thing for, but it's cool, I'm over her now.  I kinda saw it coming, and she mentioned the word "awesome" when describing my personality, and, although she may have just been flattering me, I can't say that I care anymore.  I was pretty depressed for the first few hours of the day, through Honors World Studies, where I spent the whole time freezing my ass off while Joe and Jarrod talked about this bad idea for a 3-d project we have to do in a week.  Eventually I just got sick of hearing the crazy shit that they were saying, I took the pencil and said "no, screw this, we're building a pantheon-temple thingy out of legos with christ on top."  The project is on Roman Religion, Philosophy, and Society.  The idea kinda shut them up and from them on I just read this insane exerpt from a book on Rome, which I've gotta confess I remember nothing about, because it was written  so  poorly.  Never give a second grader a thesaurus and access to a library full of history books.  But as the day wore on I forced myself to flirt with the cool girls that I could find, and I did so, and enjoyed doing so immeasurably.  It cured me, and suddenly I was over her.  I spent art class flirting, talking about how myself and my fellow jews plan on taking over the world, and reading J.M Roberts' A Short History of the World, which is awesome.  By this time snow had been coming down quite a bit, but there had been no word on school being cancelled.  So I perked up, fought my way through the crowds of the halls and went to math class, where I had a pretty easy time, as usual--my teacher is cool, I hate math, and am terrible at it (although I would really, really like to be good at it. I have a great respect for math wizzes), and rest assured, the class could be a lot worse.  I had the math teacher from hell last year.  God, I hate her and hated her so, so much...I had the classmates from hell, too.  The most depressing thing about that class is the dumbasses that are in it with me, a few of them are like me, are reasonably intelligent but are just bad at math, and they're cool, but the rest are just mindless society drones.  They're okaaay, but, still...  I went to lunch, found out that I was an  urlLink asshole , ate food and enjoyed myself.  I left with Rich, we went outside to examin the snow and found a pair of school busses arriving.  I went to Wellness, which is a class calibrated for dipshits, and then heard that I only had a few minutes of school left.  Which was cool.  But the thing is, I still had to  go  to Wellness, listen to the teacher, who I despise, listen to my class, which has some cool people, but is mostly full of rednecks...and, yeah.  I left, and then went sledding with Rich, Gideon, Pete and Jeremy, froze my ass off, even though it was hella fun.  We tried to get some ladies to come with us, but they wouldn't hear it.  I came home.  Played the guitar for half an hour+  I'm really starting to like it.  I sat down at the comp and now I'm here.  Yep...

      This may be the foundation of a longer story someday, but for the moment I'm going to turn it into a twenty or thirty pager.  It still needs some work, but I like it so far.  If you happen to stumble upon this site and read through my stuff, I'd love to hear any comments you might have.  Email me at shrike116@hotmail.com, make sure to mention this website or something that will catch my eye, I have my inbox on full protection so anything that looks like an ad is deleted by yours truly. Take  care.  MYRIAD  It was the last day of The Empire.  The great and only city world of Galvan found itself surrounded by throngs of enormous cargo vessels carrying the billions of civilians away from the dark towers and skyscrapers below, their bodies weaving sluggishly through the hail of turret fire from the Morrow warships, most often unsuccessfully.  Their hulls would bloom with great bursts of light, they would split and rent at their very metallic seams and burst apart in agony, the light blinding and terrifying the eyes of any onlooker.  Many of them perished in the blockade they were attempting to breach, only the smaller, private ships managed to break through, the turrets weren’t calibrated for their size, and this left them with the time to spring away to the stars, their warp drives brightening exponentially before they disappeared entirely.  Hours passed, Galvan fell silent—the cities below were dark without the electricity that flowed through them, and the Morrow fell through the atmosphere and systematically incinerated the great workings of the humans that had lived there, leaving a wasteland of shredded and charred alloy to be converted into the hulls of their own ships.  The wreckage from the Great Slaughter coalesced into a brilliant ring encircling the burning corpse of Galvan, the Morrow warships divided and began the long chase after the humans that had escaped, and the lights of the cosmos were silent, once again.  And for a period of many decades the Humans and the Morrow skirmished about the playground of the galaxy, mankind’s numbers dwindled as their ships and planets were overrun or destroyed entirely.  Their greatest weapons were used many times against the alien menace, and they had some success, but it was not long before they became completely useless.  The great fleets of the Morrow marched onward until every last world that smelled of humanity found itself without a corpuscle of life to inhabit its surface.  The Milky Way had been gleamed of its only sentient race, and almost a hundred Sol years after it started the Last Conflict concluded.  The once thought force never expected by its inhabitants had obliterated perpetual society of mankind—one that had, despite its inward doubts, survived the trials of time.  Hundreds of thousands of years of peace and prosperity led up to a final climax of destruction.  Every achievement was lost, completely.  The Morrow spent the next eons spreading their own seed about the untold nonillions of suitable worlds, and they looked outward, to the other galaxies of the local gravitational arena, looked with their powerful telescopes for signs of intelligence that would slow their advance, but definitely not halt it.  Their own society was built on expansion and military action; it had long forgotten its upbringing, one similar to the now extinct mankind.  They were hardly better than animals that understood the workings of complex machinery; evolution had defeated the purpose of individuality or intelligence among them.  They were the perfect conquerors, using the work of their long dead ancestors to bring the universe under their control, one galaxy at a time.  It was at their height that they disappeared completely.  A disease wiped them out in under a century, every last one of them could not comprehend the events unfolding before their eyes, and so they perished, their fleets adrift in the chasm of space, their cities empty atop worlds that could now live, their fuels burning away, leaving their planets dark.  Nature reclaimed its land, plants and animals soon frolicked the megaliths on the planets below orbiting shipyards.  Many other civilizations thrived elsewhere, but this place was unique in that it was empty.  Many, many millions of years passed, the Morrow’s works decayed and crumbled.  Mankind evolved into being, again.

      Over my "vacation" at my grandparent's house, something odd occured.  I woke up at about five in the morning, it was light enough outside for me to glance at my arm, which had fallen asleep enough for me to not be able to move it at all.  It had gone completely numb, I could only wiggle it back and forth using my shoulder.  So, as I glanced at my arm, for whatever reason, I found that there were several, maybe four or five,  bite marks  on it, as well as a long scratch or two.  Oddly enough, being slightly asleep, I thought nothing of it.  I awoke a few hours later to find the marks gone.  I can remember the marks looking like they came from the upper jaw of a human skull, so, chances are, it was me.  Later on by chance I glanced at the wall next to where my bed was, and I saw immediately that it had been torn and scratched as if someone had shredded it with an axe!  I was amazed that no one else noticed....  The drive back was terrible.  I hate travel, so, so much.  I like going places, but I hate  getting  there.  It's not that I'm impatient, you probably won't meet a more patient guy in your life, but I get so uncomfortable, I go insane with boredom, I have to listen to other people bickering about how different or similar the colors red and green are, etc etc. It just gets monotonous.  I finished Ishmael, which I highly recommend, in spite of being disapointed.  I was confused until the end, I had seen the author, Daniel Quinn's point, that civilization is destroying the world, however, he gave no instruction as to how to  stop  doing so.  He put it rather mildly, "stop enslaving the planet."  I'd love to, but I wouldn't know where to begin.  I really had a problem with this book because I had always seen "leaver" society as not being intellectually fulfilling.  The leavers, who are dwindling in numbers, are the tribespeople, while we, the "takers," are of civilization.  I love to write, I love to do various things that you just can't get with leaver society.  In fact, I think I'd die of boredom if I lived like Quinn makes them out to live.  Maybe if I was raised differently I'd think differently, but I enjoy reading and writing and learning too much to forsake what civilization has given me.  The trouble is, this book has made me add "if we're still around" to any sentence that makes mention of the future.

      On the Death Throes of Humanity and Societism--  I live in the world of science fiction.  DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER!  DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER!  DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER!  I watch the news and hear of people taping up rooms in their homes in case of a biological assault.  I am typing on a computer, posting my thoughts to a community a million people strong.  I am listening to the second CD of George Harrison's All Things Must Pass.  I have just gorged myself on some mediocre restaurant food.  The life I am living right now--and, the life the reader is living right now, is as different and unexpected as any of our predecessors could have concieved of.  We live in a world that is no longer bound to the limitations of reality.    And it is all going to hell.  I read a story once, it may have been scifi, I don't quite remember, but it was about a time traveller who went back to the 1880s and said that he was really, really enjoying himself.  I can remember the quote exactly--"the lemonade is great!"  He went back to a time that, although war torn, like our own, did not have the threat of atomic warheads or terrorism.  Our world is growing more and more complex by the second, our society is decaying from the inside, is losing any backbone that it may have thought itself to harbour.  It is important to remember that every society since the beginning has thought that the end was near for it, almost like a failsafe to keep its followers loyal.  History has shown us that absolutely nothing is perpetual.  Fifty years for the human race.   Lord, a little more time!   Only, unlike every other form of life before us, we will not be destroyed by immediate changes in the environment.  We will destroy ourselves.  We have, and we will, create those changes.  Humanity has been given an ultimate power.  We have become gods.  We hold the fate of our planet in our hands, we can destroy or make thrive any creature we desire.  The world is our slave, now, and we are its master.  But we are imperfect.  We are corrupted by greed, quite easily.  It is not the fantasy of some neo liberal teenager, it is the truth.  Every one of us has some facet of desire, some goal that we must achieve one way or another, may it be the presidency or a cup of orange juice.  We all want.  I'm not sure that I've ever been completely satisfied in my entire life.  I cannot say the same for everyone, but I can guess.  Fifty years from now, at our peak, humanity will have reached somewhere around the range of 12 billion people.  Three times what it is now.  Three times the employees at your office.  Three times the children in schools.  Three times the starving people around the world.  Three times the corrupt politicians.  If we have not destroyed ourselves by then the chances for our destruction will have multiplied significantly since this very second.  The population will level off, will decline, may even be eliminated completely.  I look at this as a bad thing.  Because, unlike my fellows, I have hope for the world, and faith in humanity.   Something  can or will be done.  Some magic, some new technology, a voyage to the stars, some clever invention.  We need this miracle.  The sooner the better.  The world is at its throat because of misinformation, of deceit, and of treachery, all of it happening within the borders of our American democracy.  It must be stopped.  Nonviolently.  Why can we not enter a golden age, of prosperity, of endeavor, why must we be bound to a fate of destruction?  I feel that it is not yet definite.  I feel that we can evolve again, into something better than ourselves.  I don't know how.  But I know that it is a possibility, and just as worthy of consideration as destruction.  We can forgoe.  But we all must work to do so.  Every last tycoon, every last slave, every last breadwinner for the fate of the species.  We have to work together.  As one, instead of six billion.  How?  Two children per family.  No exceptions.  Dissolve the boundaries of our nations, leave them instead as provinces.  Representatives work on the local, state, provincial, and national dimensions of government.  They are elected democratically.  This is not a new thing, however, I feel that the elections will have greater results with the next phase of humanity's salvation.  Earth would not be able to spend more on any project than the education of its children.  All schools are to be public ones, and all of them are to recieve substantial funding for whatever need they can think of.  Two new classes would become standard, along with math, english, and history--an awareness of society class, and a philosophy one.  Again, no exceptions.  Children are graded on different standards, as deemed by their teachers, who are also paid considerably, and who go through a great deal of training from other teachers.  This way, if it all "works out," the people will wield a great deal of power against their opressors--the government, and the church.  Their knowledge will empower them to elect strong representatives, who will work for them instead of themselves.  Also, any person can run for office, necessary funding can be acquired through the government.  Through its own power, humanity  can  be saved.  No violence would be permitted.  None.  If any person does not wish to join, then let it be their own loss, and leave them behind.  Superiority is negligent.  Thus, I deem Societism: the uniting of all peaceful peoples, each to be given strong educations, each to have the same opportunities, each to forgoe the barbarisms of our own time.  And none to be forced into doing so by any measure.  Let humanity thrive.  Let culture bloom.  Let tomorrow bring prosperity to all.

      I arrived in Cape Cod a few hours ago, the drive wasn't so bad.  I finished Crichton's Prey and duly enjoyed it.  I've been writing the backstory for Intertwine lately, I'm sure my reader is starved for information.  All I can give you is a cool word I invented: "Vacitadat," which means "gun warrior."  The X box is making things go faster down here, although I do have work to get to...  Anyhoo, I shall see you later!

      I'm off to the Cape tomorrow morning.  I think I just finished editing Ship's Log, if it isn't done then it's really close.  SHIP’S LOG 	14:25 	5-16-23 	[BEGIN ENTRY] I just cannot get enough of this zero g.  It’s going to be a few more hours before the rest of the crew get the artificial stuff working, and since I have no technical knowledge of this spacecraft I have delegated my time to studying the acrobatics one can perform while not anchored to the ground.  I left the NASA Wheel about a day ago with my two crew companions; I had spent about a week there after lifting off from Cape Canaveral on a beautiful Friday morning.  I managed to get a vid of it from the ground. It was incredible.  Watching a transport’s blue tail pass through a thin veil of sun-scarred clouds has made me feel like a bit of a poet rather than “the scientist” as I’m sure my fellows refer to me as.  The Wheel itself was fairly boring, the people there seemed depressed beyond what I could have expected.  I mean, I had heard rumors, but, still.  It almost seemed as if each one was on the verge of tears, because they had been confined there for several months and had to watch as astronauts and scientists like myself departed for various locations around the solar system.  At one point I tried to watch an old, roman-epic movie but found that the base’s library contained only pornographic films.  Five hundred terabytes of storage and not a pixel devoted to reality.  What a shame. 	I’m enjoying the time spent away from my wife.  Who I hate.  If my avid reader cares. 	So, anyway, our mission is a simple survey of the sun’s surface, one that should take only a few months.  I don’t intend to use this log much; I have a great deal of work to get to from the sensor readouts.  If I have time, however, I will be sure to inform my nonexistent avid reader of the various excitements of my voyage to the sun. [END ENTRY]  04:39 5/19/23 [BEGIN ENTRY] She sent me a vid just under an hour ago.  With nothing better to do, I watched it, and still have not finished.  Strangely enough, she seems to genuinely miss me, which I find curious, because we hardly spoke the day that I left, or the week before it.  I still can’t stop hating her, I won’t allow myself to crave her presence for as long as either of us lives, and even after that.  I don’t even know why I married the woman, I met her during college, it seemed like love for many months, we married, went on a honeymoon to the South Pacific and then settled into this routine of steady bickering, one that has not ceased even for a moment in ten years of marriage.  I don’t know why I don’t divorce her, I feel almost a pity, she can hardly take care of herself, even if she does spend her days hollering at me.  She used to apologize for it, but seems to have just given in to her desire to be the stronger one in our relationship.  Maybe I will divorce her… 	I have to get my mind off of her.  The ship.  Let me tell you about the ship. 	The ship itself, which lacks a name (all the good ones have long since been taken), has the serial number “GB-3628,” I’ve taken to calling it “Geebee.”  It actually isn’t so bad up here, my quarters are fairly small, but the bed is nice, the computer will, for the next week or so, have a connection to the medias of Earth and Mars.  There are a pair of hallways that run sideways and into each other, each connecting to the various science rooms, the four living quarters (one is empty), the living room, and the control center.  I first saw the ship docked to the Wheel and thought that it resembled a long cylinder with a large rectangle on the rear.  There really isn’t much more to say about it, so I think I’ll take a break and have another look at the readouts. [END ENTRY]  18:43 5-24-23 [BEGIN ENTRY] I can still see the Earth, maybe make out a continent every now and then.  I wish this thing had a telescope; the views of the stars out here are incredible.  Boredom, however, is a tough thing to live with.  Nelson and Tyler, two middle-aged, underpaid astronauts, have, for the most part kept to themselves, none of us have really spoken to one another, we’re all strangers here.  The boredom is steadily getting worse, I can imagine that in a couple of weeks, when we lose radio contact with Earth it’s going to be crazy.  I’m downloading as many books as I can, but the connection isn’t too good. [END ENTRY]  10:15 5-30-23 [BEGIN ENTRY] 	Earth looked absolutely ravishing the day I left, as it steadily shrunk into just a ball of light over the course of our journey I found myself wishing that I had some champagne to pop open, after all, my wife is back there, on that little white speck, surely bored now with no one to scream at.  We have to keep the windows facing the sun shut and wouldn’t be able to look out of them anyway (the sun tends to blind humans mercilessly), so I’m left with nothing but a chasm of faint stars to look at.  Sometimes I feel like downloading the latest movie or television shows but lately I’ve just been sleeping or going through the sensor reports, which, for some reason, I find amazingly enthralling even though they tend to consist of little more than numbers and dashes.  Nothing the ship has picked up has been unusual.  However, I’ve been feeling a sense of secrecy permeating the close air of this place, my questions regarding the sun itself are tensely answered and then tend to degenerate into a “how’s the wife” conversation.  Those never get too far, what with my hating my spouse.  And, in addition to it all, this mission must have been enormously expensive for the UN, I have no idea why they would want to send us on this kind of task, one that could be handled (from a safe distance) just as easily by one of hundreds of satellites they have scattered throughout the solar system.  Most of the data I get now comes from them, and will continue to do so until June 2. 	Nelson and Tyler are polite, but they just don’t seem to enjoy my company.  Whenever I arrive in the “living room” and find them both conversing they immediately stop and shift the subject.  I guess I never believed those stories about animosity from astronauts toward scientists, almost like the prevalent racism of mid twentieth century America.  I’m sure they must have some slur they refer to me as behind my back, but I don’t really want to get to the bottom of it.   	I’m starting to think that the only good thing about this mission is that I’m as far away as I can possibly be from my wife.  God, how I loathe her… [END ENTRY]  09:38 6-02-23 [BEGIN ENTRY] 	We’ve passed through an outer-atmosphere of radiation, rendering our communication with Earth impossible.  I am both ecstatic and depressed.  I don’t have to send any more letters to my wife, nor do I have to read the ones she sends to me.  However I now only have the few books I downloaded, the few movies, and the sensor readouts from the ship for entertainment.  Two hours ago the radar picked up an object just a few miles away, extremely close space-wise, it was an asteroid or comet that NORAD hadn’t mapped out during the stellar cartography missions of the fifties.  The computers in the control room were going nuts, the lights dimmed to red and everything, as if we were living through the last few seconds of an old Sci Fi movie.  It seems to have disintegrated, it must have been made of ice, but we’re all still on edge.  I try not to speak to my crewmates.  I’m starting to develop a relationship with them similar to the one I wish I’d have with my wife: One with no verbal communication. [END ENTRY]   11:50 6-02-23 [BEGIN ENTRY] 	Christ almighty, something just hit us.  Nelson and Tyler are freaking out.  The ship is spinning like a merry-go-round. We can’t close any of the windows for some reason so the sun blasts us every other twenty seconds.  According to the instruments we’re losing oxygen fast—we already don’t have enough to get back to Earth.  They’re looking for the hole right now, but because of the heat outside they can’t do an EVA, so it isn’t likely that they’ll be able to patch it up.  I can’t stop sweating or shaking, it’s getting to be somewhat of a challenge to type these letters.  Maybe I should switch to verbal, but then I’d just stutter.  I really don’t know about this.  It could be it.  For me.  What the hell are we going to do?  We don’t have enough oxygen…we’re out of contact with Earth…and every twenty seconds we can’t see a damn thing with our own eyes…Christ almighty…what am I going to do? [END ENTRY]  17:10 6-03-23 [BEGIN ENTRY] 	Tyler managed to find the hole and cover it up with some metal from the pantry that he welded on.  We have four more days of oxygen.  I’ve spent as much time away from the crew as possible, luckily the sensors are still doing fine, even though we haven’t stopped spinning.  The readings haven’t changed a great deal, but, oddly enough, the fact that they have changed is cause for some concern on my part.  Nelson managed to at least keep the ship from spinning any faster, which is good, because if it were to increase in speed we might all be permanently blinded.  The sun would be on every side of the ship at once, in our eyes, splitting open our heads.   [END ENTRY]  18:20 6-03-23 [BEGIN ENTRY] The explosion must have screwed up the ship’s main computer; I had a look at the objectives and noticed immediately that they had changed significantly.  This isn’t a scientific mission, there’s a fusion warhead on the nose of Geebee that is incomprehensibly powerful, if it exploded here Saturn might lose its rings from the shockwave.  Apparently we were supposed to fire it into the sun, but I’ve looked at the damage reports, and the mechanism for launching the rocket itself has been completely severed.  I think they were planning on telling me, but I’m not really sure.  The wieners back on Earth had no clue as to what was and is happening inside the sun, but they think that its heart may need a kind of jumpstart, like shocking a heart attack victim when their pulse flatlines.  I’m just not sure about this, really, really not sure…I wish I had someone to talk to, I’m beginning to talk to myself more and more now… [END ENTRY]   19:15 6-03-23 [BEGIN ENTRY] 	I’ve done some calculations.  One of us would be able to make it back if…if the other two weren’t around.  Even with the sensor readouts, which have been going insane, I still can’t stop thinking about the deadline four days from now, when we’ll all suffocate to death.  I can see it clearly, my mouth will open and I’ll cough, my eyes will widen, I’ll fall to the metal floor, claw at the air with my hands, and then cease to move.  Weeks from now a ship may come and get us, but, who knows, with the sun having a heart attack there may not be a human alive in the solar system to pack us up. [END ENTRY]  23:27 6-03-23 [BEGIN ENTRY] 	I walked into the living room to get some food and noticed that Tyler and Nelson were viciously staring at each other.  There was total contempt for one another in their eyes.  Their muscles were tense.  Sweat beads ran down their foreheads.  Their gray hair shone each time the sun blasted us.  Something’s going to give.  I managed to sneak one of the knives back to my cabin; I may bolt the door or lock it somehow, if I can. [END ENTRY]  02:13 6-04-23 [BEGIN ENTRY] 	They’re screaming and banging on my door right now, shouting profanities, using those slurs that I mentioned a few days ago.  I had just locked the door and braced it with my computer hard drive when they started bashing on it and demanding that I come out.  There’s no way that I’m leaving here.  No way.  I haven’t answered them once, I’ve tried not to make any noise…wait a second…they stopped, they’re listening…I shouldn’t be typing, but—but it helps, somehow, makes me feel like I’m not alone nine AU’s from the Earth with no radio contact.  I have to stop, now, I have to, I know they can hear me. [END ENTRY]  02:45 6-04-23 [BEGIN ENTRY] 	I just heard a scream, I think it was Nelson.  My god…he’s outside…Jesus…he’s out there right now.  Nelson’s body, I can see it every few seconds.  It’s disintegrating.   His skin is clinging to his bones.  I can see the skull beneath his face.  I can’t turn away.  It looks like he has a stab wound to the chest, but I can’t tell, I only get to see him for a second.  Then the sun flashes, then I see him again, almost like the frames of an old movie.  At least, this way, we have a week of oxygen left.  That’ll put us within visible range of Earth.  At least, if I die, I’ll get a last look at my homeworld. [END ENTRY]  05:03 6-05-23 [BEGIN ENTRY] 	I have to get food.  I’m going to confront Tyler.  I’m not leaving without the knife. [END ENTRY]  07:15 6-05-23 [BEGIN ENTRY] 	As soon as I left my cabin he came at me and tore open my left shoulder, Christ, it hurts.  The man was easily twice my size, so I ran from him, shut all the doors behind me and turned off the gravity.  I came back at him, with my mastery of zero g from screwing around all those days before.  I slit his throat, blood gushed everywhere.  It’s on my hands right now, but I can’t tell if it’s mine or his.  He choked, gasped and coughed, his eyes widened and then faded as life left them.  I jettisoned him just a second ago, and am now enjoying a roast beef sandwich.  It’s pretty good. [END ENTRY]  08:15 6-06-23 [BEGIN ENTRY] 	I can’t get the gravity back.  I don’t care.  I have no idea how to control this thing.  There must be a thousand acronyms, one for each button in the cockpit.  The ship doesn’t come with a manual.  I’ve got to hope that Tyler left it on autopilot.  I’ve showered four times and can’t get any of the blood off of my body, but my shoulder seems to have stopped bleeding.  The sensors have gone totally berserk.  There may be merely a solar storm brewing down there, or it might be getting ready to go nova prematurely.  I don’t know.  I need more time.  Blood is everywhere.  I’ve tried to wash it away, but the ship won’t stay clean.  The sun is giving me a constant headache; I think I may be losing my sight as well.  I can’t sleep; it’s so goddamn bright in here.  Even though I’ve showered four times I still appear as if I just walked out of a Chewbacca-look-alike contest. [END ENTRY]  11:49 6-10-23 [BEGIN VERBAL ENTRY] I can’t see anymore.  It’s been nearly impossible to get things back up and running I’ve managed.  The ship reads the data aloud to me, now.  I think I’ve got a general idea as to what’s happening in the core.  For whatever reason, the fusion cycle has been slowing down and speeding up, and the process has been accelerating exponentially.  If my eyes worked, I bet I’d be able to see the sun flashing.  I also bet the kind folks back on Earth and the solar system abroad can see it as well.  Sooner or later something is going to explode, there’s going to be a huge burst of heat.  It may be enough to incinerate the planets; or it may only be enough to raise the temperature by a few degrees for a few hours.  I just don’t know, and I’m not sure that I can know until it happens.   The computer says that I’m on my way back to Earth.  I don’t know how I’m going to explain the deaths of two fellow crewmembers to NASA.  I may have to edit or delete this log.  I could just say that they fought each other and both threw themselves out into space.  But they won’t believe that.  I’m just a scientist, not an astronaut, not a politician, not a businessman.  Not a liar.  I can’t lie.  They’d see it in a second.  I’d break down…plus, they’d never believe me, with this blood everywhere.   I hate my wife.  I wish she were here right now.  Her voice has been running through my head like there’s no tomorrow.  Even though I can’t see.  I’d enjoy hearing her scream.  I’d enjoy feeling my hands tear open her throat, that’d stop her nagging.  The stupid bitch can go to hell; it might be more comfortable than where I am right now. [END ENTRY]  --date malfunction— [BEGIN VERBAL ENTRY] She’s here.  I don’t know how.  She won’t leave me alone.  Blood is seeping from the walls.  I can feel it.  I can smell it.  Shut up!  Shut your mouth you whore!  Leave me alone!  God, someone help me, anyone, help me, please…Oh just leave me alone, get away!  Stay the hell away from me!  Only a few more hours until radio contact with Earth.  Only a few more hours…but do I want to do it?  They might find out, they might find me guilty before I even get back, then they’d shoot me down with a missile.  But there might not even be an Earth left to get back to…no I don’t care what you say about my shirt color! God…be quiet… [END ENTRY]  --date malfunction— [BEGIN VERBAL ENTRY] The ship started shaking a few seconds ago.  It’s really shaking now.  I think I can hear it falling apart.  The blood, the blood is everywhere—I think I can see again!  It is terrible, My God, the ship, it’s like a nightmare, the blood, the knives!  Tyler, Nelson, and my wife are screaming at me and threatening me, I don’t know how.  It’s shaking more now.  The portholes look like they’re surrounded by some kind of inferno.  I’m going to have a look. 	I don’t know how I’m alive, or how the ship is in one piece.  There’s a firestorm around the hull that looks like comet tails and solar flares, just steaming by.  It’s stopped shaking.  I can see Earth now.  I haven’t contacted them.  They haven’t contacted me.  I can see through the inferno.  My god, it’s—it’s frying the surface, the planet is turning black, it’s falling apart, disintegrating, no more than a cloud of dust, oh, my, my, my… [END ENTRY]  --date malfunction— [BEGIN VERBAL ENTRY] I have been unable to make contact with anyone.  I had hoped that somewhere in the solar system someone else was still alive.  I can’t find any of the planets.  There seems to be some kind of a red glow in every direction outside, like the color of blood.  I can’t move my arms anymore, I don’t know why, I can hardly move at all, it might be all the radiation, getting to my brain, it’s becoming harder to speak…I don’t even have the luxury to commit suicide.  Nelson, stay back— [END ENTRY]

      Well it's been awhile since I've posted anything.  A few days.  So I'm going to write something fairly lengthy, complete with exerpts from Intertwine, and some poetry I've been working on.  First off, for all of my fans, I know there must be thousands of you all, using the same few computers, yeah, anyhoo--  Friday-- Well, World Studies was boring as hell, because we didn't do anything.  Okay, we actually built up about fifteen columns out of legos, then decided that we didn't need them.  But it was fun.  Jarrod tweaked out, as usual, when left to his own devices.  Joe yelled at Jarrod.  As did I.  Bekka just laughed every now and then.  I went to Art class, which was also fairly boring, and was looking forward to a flirtfest with a few girls that are there, but during that time we decided to write some OBVIOUSLY false love letters to our dumbass friend Andy Pooler, as I recall mine was very poetic, I think I ended it with something to the effect of "I wish I could sacrifice an unborn fetus to you."  But, Colin showed them to the girls I was going to ask to see the Two Towers, and they got pissed off (actually referred to us as "assholes") and then tore them up.  Somewhat of a failure there.  To them, chances are it isn't flirting, but, hey, the day or two before I wrote "Thus Sprach Zarathustra" on one of their arms, and if that isn't flirting then I don't know what is.  Don't remember much about math class.  Keep in mind, this was three days ago.  I totally screwed up a wellness exam, but, fuck I don't care, it's wellness for christsake.  One of the questions was asking who the school nurse was, and I didn't know her name, so I put "Robert Wagner."  I also got a paper back, where I was required to write about a stress in my life.  Because I know the teacher is a femma-nazi I said "women."  I wish I could have it here with me now, it's some of the funniest stuff EVER.  I shall attempt to recall the questions-- How can you live with your stress? The female gender is a thing we must all endeavour to live with.  What is the cause of your stress? Genetics.  Can your stress be prevented? Attempts at sex change have been attempted, but results have been limited.  Can your stress be predicted? Women are fairly unpredictable.  That is why Egypt fell to Rome under Cleopatra.  Not surprisingly, I scored an F on that paper.  Shit, I just checked my grades, I'm failing wellness.  I'll have an aneurism if I have to take this nightmare again...  Alright then.  What else? Friday night we went to see the Two Towers, it was hella fun.  I love that movie.  Or maybe it was saturday.  Dunno. I do know that I bought an x box over the weekend.  I'm addicted to, you guessed it, The Two Towers.  I purchased Halo as well, it's in the mail.  Hung out with friends on Sunday.  Hung out with friends today.  Was supposed to work on Roman project today (world studies) but forgot script in car.  Everyone actually forgot their stuff in their cars. Which is actually kinda funny.  So anyway, I have to go to Cape Cod on Wednesday.  Which fucking sucks.  I hate travelling, possibly more than anything else.  Travelling via car, via plane, via fucking starship, I don't care, it always always always sucks.  I lose my mind after eight hours in the back seat with my sister.  I get to spend until saturday down there, I'm going to read as many books as I can.  I've got some Nietzsche, Asimov, Welles, and a Short History of the World to finish.  It's going to be my ultra~mega reading vacation.  They have a pretty sweet computer, so I won't be cut off from the internet, which is also a bonus.  I think this has basically summed up my life, up to the moment.  I'm going to post an exerpt from Intertwine--  Thumping made him realize that he had lost track of time.  His eyes blinked, refocused—he was awake again.  The mountain path had thinned considerably; he was now on the edge of a cliff with hardly enough space to step.  The snow was thick, it went up to his ankles, and crunched with each step.  The wind blasted his face, his eyes blurred with tears; he wiped them away, and peered into the landscape.  Beyond him lay great mountains of teeth and enormous, blank cliffs, each drenched in snow, each barren and lifeless.  Sauria hovered above.  And, surprisingly, somewhat nearby, perched on the edge of one of these ninety-degree cliffs, was an enormous castle, one that had obviously been carved out of the mountain itself.  At its top a round dome stretched for many hundreds of feet, around its bottom circumference characters in Somaran froze.  Below the dome great columns stretched ten stories into a grand balcony, where, on the wall that surrounded it, a single, black flag fluttered about in the wind, the inscription on it resembling one white crescent on top of another.  Salax tightened his gaze, and made out a single figure standing at the edge of the wall.  His ears strained—yes, he could hear speech, it too was in the Somaran dialect, it was too distant to make out, but the voice was great and booming, it was that of a strong man, of a strong mind.  Below this balcony the castle fell for many, many stories to an arena wider than many of the pavilions back in Nelence, where thousands of armored men, each in his own rectangular brigades screamed and cheered with every pause from the figure above.    Needless to say, Salax made for the castle.  He slipped and slid and climbed down from the path he was on and fought his way over the maw of rocks and ice below, the journey taking yet another week.  He had almost run out of food by then, but he did not care, for whatever reason his body did not require fuel.  He began climbing the precipice, a journey that took him straight up the face of the cliff, his gloved hands chalked with rock.  He went without any rope, he had packed none, and within a day of climbing found himself in a small cave near the bottom of the great castle, where he could look out to the landscape far below, and even pick out his tracks.    He slept without a fire; his clothes took care of all the necessary warmth.  When he awoke a thick blanket of cloud had obscured the sun, and it was snowing lightly.  He hadn’t a clue as to the time of day, but didn’t care.  He continued on the climb, but, twenty minutes after starting a gust of wind screamed in his face, he felt his grip slipping.  His feet fell away, but he clung to the face desperately, his fingers digging into the rock, clawing at it as his eyes widened and his teeth gritted.  The gust fell away, his legs found their place again, he sighed, and grinned with a cocky victory over nature.  A greater one fell upon him now, and he had not the time to breath before he was swept into the air, his body tossed about in the currents as if he were no lighter than a sheet of parchment.  The snow now swirled about him, it was thick enough to not allow him any vision other than the white beyond his hands.  He felt the wind breathe upon him more, felt his body rise and fall and twist and turn for several minutes, until the exhalation of the clouds landed him on a flat, stone surface, where his two feet actually connected and allowed him to balance easily.  The wind then acted as a cradle, and kept him from falling.  When he had regained his footing, the wind died down and the snow fell without an influence.  It helps if you imagine the next as being sung by a ship full of jolly sailors.  Plurality   The water flutters Even as the sun dies Our wooden ship stutters Under what infinite skies The winds breathe; the Sea is ahead! To-night we soar, to-night we dread!  A White moonrise Its face doth gleam Our hearts we feel aggrandize  Our toils melt into dream Brown tendrils strain, maudlin water cries! Our Sails expand, our vessel flies!    In Our Dreams   I awake from lonely dreams Reality and fantasy, now togethered by seams Pull me from the earth; lift me to your face Let us narrow what betweens little space Can breath not wait while kisses smite? As Venus climbs in winter night? 	 This frigid night with warmth we stave We smite until effulgent day Neither sleepy, neither tired Once taciturn minds ablaze with fire. The sun now rises, our separate lives spurn In reality we depart but in dreams we return    And the last, but probably my favorite, describes the commands of a pendant while in a desert.   SONG OF THE PENDANT  From the hands of the trees Are the leaves thrown From the mouths of the titans Are the clouds blown Feel the sun’s gleams Now sweat and burn With terror it teems Baradan sojourn  Chorus:  Infinity abound Vicinity of dreams Sand is the ground Air thick of screams Barada—beckon! Engage in your plight The dunes steepen Consciousness takes flight  Bring the axe down, kill them all! Dodge their bullets, watch them fall! Split their swords, rent their armor Lope atop the sand Behead them in ardor  Leave life behind, it means no more! Let them feel your wrath! Let them feel your gore!  (chorus)  Their explosions have ceased Their tortures forever spurn Now end this tease To your homeland, return Ivlüv awaits! Its sky is still blue! Bring them their fates! Bring them their doom!

       Let tomorrow burn  My new slogan for one of the many bad guys of Intertwine.  I like it.  I spent yesterday among my various flirtations.  There is little more of value to say about tuesday, other than that because of a jazz festival tomorrow a huge portion of my writing class didn't show up.  This left me to wait for an hour at least, my mom was preoccupied elsewhere.  During this time, I came up with the  Let Tomorrow Burn .  I haven't really developed the story enough, however I have been working on the background history, and have gotten a little farther.  Today...let's see...what did I do today...I'm afraid of mentioning my various exploits and adventures of everyone's favorite day of the week (which, for future readers, is wednesday).  Impressionable eyes may be reading, and what I divulge could create conflict.  I've been devouring 1984, I expect that I shall have it finished by the end of the week.  It is phenomenal, probably going to be one of the top ten that I've ever read.  Highly recommended.  Because I have little better to do, I'm just going to post an exerpt from what I've written in the last hour--  His fingers clutched thick fabric.  He opened his squinted eyes, and before him a huge, burly figure of a soldier stood.  The man quickly whirled around, his body black against the snow, his armor concealed under layers upon layers of fabric.  His head was shrouded behind a dark hood; he could see the faint outlines of pursed lips behind it, but nothing more.  They drew their swords at the same time, the ring not carrying far in the haze, the sound muffled.  Salax came at him, swinging his blade at the soldier’s head, finding the blow blocked, then quickly retaliating and trying the other side.  The man successfully deflected each attack or thrust and appeared to be toying with Salax, who had, for several years now, thought of himself as an accomplished swordsman.  He thought he could hear a hoarse laugh behind the cape, but it was too faint to confirm.  Salax withdrew and held his sword defensively before his head.  The soldier wasted no time in coming after him, his attacks were strong and the clangs of metal upon metal brought pain to both of their ears.  Salax saw an opportunity, an opening, and he wasted no time in going for it.  His gleaming metal blade shot forward and sliced through the man’s right arm. The soldier groaned, and then growled.  Salax backed away into the snow, and waited for the man to follow.    Originally I thought to create one of the prime villains out of this ordinary soldier, but decided against it.  I'm really not sure what I'm going to do with the story.  I think I'll rant about the background--  Thousands of years ago, in the universe I have created, a group of nomadic people (think of them as cavemen) migrated from a landbridge onto the continent of Ociedies.  I've made a pretty damn good map, but I think it's too big to photocopy.  I'll see what I can do.  Anyway, most of them settled in this northern area later called Erogada.  It was a lush paradise, almost like a candyland, fruit on every tree, you get the idea.  Archaelogists from the modern era then found nothing but a layer of charred rock in Erogada, as if the whole land had burst into flame at once.  Many people died, many skeletons were found.  Those that escaped went southward, into Achamaeda, and, over the course of several thousand years, developed a civilization.  The year zero came when a future great philosopher--T'lumo, was born.  He creates somewhat of a scientific and literary renaissance and rules over the whole of the Diean race for eighty years, before his death.  Afterwards, people from the largest city on the continent--Tarascus, began to disagree, and they fled further southward, past a great ridge of mountains, whose name I forget at the moment--but anyway, they found a new empire by the name of Gol Trachos.  After much exploring of their southern territory they come upon a huge city inhabited by people calling themselves "Colos."  The city is annexed  by their emperor, Narnte Trantus, and then handed over to Sarnte, his brother.  He subjugates the people and tortures them, until their savior, their messiah, is born.  His name is Somar, and, at the age of twenty he would liberate the city and slay Sarnte.  At this same time, a huge expedition of explorers from the west arrive in a place untouched by the Trachans or any humans at all, and they begin to build settlements.  They encounter the Trachan capital city of Qhorva and wipe the whole of the population there out, leaving the young son of the dead emperor, Tertius, to take the reins of Gol Trachos.  He drives the "Isardans" away and flees to Colodan (the annexed city), to find that it has been fortified against him.  The Colos, meanwhile, find that two armies--the Isardans, and the Trachans--are marching toward them, and so, with Somars leadership they flee across an archipelago and find a huge, open, empty tropical-desert continent they name after Somar.  From that day they would all be called Somarans.  This is what I have, for the most part, and it is ancient history.  I'll get back to this later.

      I'm listening to the Pixie's "Gigantic" right now.  Awesome song.  If you want to dl it, get the "Velouria Live" version.    My  urlLink sciforums thread  seems to be doing well, I'm appreciating all of the replies, of course.  I think I make myself out to be going a little more nuts than usual.  It comes and go, the feeling of being just a molecule in a block of iron, you know?  Nothing has happened today.  Nothing.  I was supposed to go work out, but the place closes in an hour and we wouldn't be able to make it.  I'd go tomorrow, but Halo should be in the P.O, and I'll probably have a ton of things to work on.  I'm failing wellness at the moment, but I don't care.  The only class I have an A in is World Studies--that's likely to go down............gah...I'm dying of boredom.   I need to get to school.  I miss my friends.

      I've written the following for a short story contest in Maine that I am hopefully not too late for.   LORD AND KEEPER   I adamantly deny the truth of my past because I can.  It has been weeks beyond count of fingers and toes that I have remained in the Augusta Mental Facility.  Such weeks have been spent peering inquisitively out my small bedroom window, where my eyes, in bated trepidation, have been watching the rising and setting of the glimmering sun, and the waves of wind dancing over spears of green grass.  The outside world taunts me.  As I peer into it, it peers back, its teeth locked together in a grin of resolute defense.  I can feel the things out there, the forces, the numina awaiting my return to what lies beyond this sanctuary of whitewashed walls and bedcovers. They are defenders of nature, of nature’s ancient secrets hidden in the sepulchers of the most despoiled forests, where the air is thick and dank under tenebrous draperies of thick leaves and foliage.  It is to these forests, and to these sepulchers, that I have been, and survived.  The older natives who existed tens of thousands of years prior to the coming of the white men were the guardians of these stone tombs, these citadels hidden behind walls of dark forest.  Only fragments of an oral tradition remain of what was once a civilization beyond the fantasies of any insane man.  While walking to work in cacophonous New York City I was pushed by a large man into a back alley (surely by accident), whereupon I found myself near a secluded and hidden store professing to sell Indian Incantations and Spells.  Behind its large window, which had been, over the years (and possibly decades) covered by a thick film of dust and cobweb, figurines of detestable creatures roared and screamed silently.  They were of a strange sort that I had never encountered before, and my being in the field of archeology kindled my interest in them immediately.  I noticed that they had been constructed of what looked like petrified, gray wood, and possessed exaggerated features of bipedal man.  Large heads, large lips, large eyes and very small noses glared back at my curiosity, and their teeth seemed to convey an intense desire for blood, like the desire of post-pubescent teenagers seeking the voluptuaries associated with sexual intercourse.  I entered the store and felt a background anxiety puncture my cerebral cortex.  I scratched at the back of my neck for only a moment, before a very short and thin Native American woman, of whose elderly frailty goes beyond words, began to jabber at me in a dialect I could not at the least decipher.  I tried to interject with “excuse me’s” and “sorry’s” but they were to no avail.  I stood there and comprehended departing, that was obviously what she wanted, however after several minutes her son appeared from behind a pile of these figurines and took her aside.  He was a handsome, tanned-skin man of dark, rolling hair, and he smiled as he spoke in broken English.    I asked him of this place, inquired about its age, and he told me that it had been here since the city had been founded, and that as age withered it to its current state it had grown forgotten.  My eyes drifted from the conversation and landed squarely upon an idol that looked to be slightly larger than the others, and he immediately noticed my inquisitiveness and called it “T’lumo.”  I could not look away from it.  He continued in his description of the thing, telling me of an ancient City of the Gods that lay beyond the greatest forests and mountainsides, where the creators of that thing slept in huge theaters, and, when awoken, would revile in bloodsport that they forced upon their slaves.  I said I would take it.    As time progressed I returned to the store and learned more of the city and of how I might go there, and, a little under a year later, driven by an insatiable curiosity possibly caused by the figurine I now spoke to when in private quarters, I sold all of my assets, moved out of my apartment and flew into the west.  For some years in my early adulthood I wandered.  T’lumo kept me company, and, at times, he replied to my murmurings.  Through the idol I finally discerned the location of the City, and embarked upon the forests of eastern California.  Guided by him, the old car I had stolen brought me to the border of the forest that they spoke, and even in daylight it seemed to pilfer the light from the sky.  I entered the forest and found it a challenge to step between the vast trunks of the trees, many of which held zeniths that were far beyond my range of sight.  After some hours it was so dark that I could no longer tell the time of day.  When I became tired I found it impossible to find a space large enough to lie down upon, so I merely rested my head against the nearest angled tree branch.  When I awoke I was no longer in the same place.  My clothes had been drenched in what was my own sweat, and they were also tattered.  My provisions were gone, but I felt no desire for food or drink.  Around me, the nauseating closeness of the forest had fallen back to a mangled horizon that surrounded my every glance, and, instead I stood upon a great field of green grass, and the wind was on my face.  In the distance, several mountains rose, their snowy tops camouflaged by the clouded sky.  My gazing centered upon an enormous megalith that climbed the sky.  Great, pale blocks of the most pure white had been smoothly assembled into a sloped pyramid, however, the pyramid itself started after a cube of twenty floors in height.  It looked to go beyond the canopy of the clouds, and it obscured the sun.  I cautiously walked around the megalith, and found, in one of its sides that was previously obscured, a great and tall triangular door built for the titans that T’lumo had spoken of during my murmurings to him.  At that moment, I thought of my idol, my hands flew to my pockets and patted them down—but he was gone.  I began to scream and bawl in despair, at the hopelessness of it all, even though I stood before a goldmine of information for an archeologist such as myself.  I hammered my fists upon the earth as my knees fell to it, I cried for my idol, who had gone with my unconsciousness.  I felt, then, the trembling of the ground below, felt the tremors roll and grumble.  I looked up, and wiped away blurred eyes, to see the megalith in all of its glory once more.  At the doorway, a being of near transparency as tall as the great doorway itself had appeared.  Its head was of a kite-like shape, its body thin, but still looking strong.  Even though it had no eyes, it looked to be glaring directly at me.  Its body pivoted to face mine, and it proceeded to fall to its front arms and lope greedily in my direction, the earth quaking so tremendously as to cause my body to fling about it as if I were no heavier than a grass blade.  Reality overwhelmed me, I began to feel the world drifting away, I heard T’lumo, in my mind or maybe near my ear—it made no difference—I heard him say that this thing was a numina, a guardian of what I had defiled, a guardian of the City of the Gods, and that it would devour every last atom of my body and convert me to an immortal slave destined to spend the rest of eternity under the whip of nature’s wrath.  I don’t know how, but many weeks ago I found myself here, in Augusta, Maine.  No one has spoken to me.  I receive a meal every few hours shoved through a slit at the bottom of the door.  My window offers me a view of the greater beyond, but of no humanity.  I cannot open it.  I cannot escape.  I do not know what is happening.  It is with great effort that I scrawl this upon the wall in my own blood.  I shall look again outside, yes, they are there, the numina from the Great City of the Gods, leaping and bounding over the woods.  The birds flock away from them in great swarms.  The sun is setting, the sky is descending from light to dark, it is in its phase of orange twilight, and is brilliant.  Oh, what a sight to behold—none have seen what I am peering into, none can comprehend it, yes, they are coming for me, they are standing at my window, I cannot see beyond their legs, an ethereal arm is reaching through, yes, I am coming for you now, my lord and keeper T’lumo…

      Well it's been quite awhile since an update.  But I have not forgotten!  Let's start with today.  We finally got to putting together our presentation, we presented the play that I wrote, I spoke on the Roman Gods for ten minutes straight--it was a very boring lecture--but, anyway, Jarrod proceeded to do his Sean Connery impression while reading the lines for Jupiter (many, if not all of which, were written seriously).  I think he got a little carried away, he made a few connery-esque jokes during various monologues, and it kinda pissed me off...But, I believe the presentation went over smoothly.  The teacher slammed us with a poster project due tomorrow, I just finished doing my part of it.  Exciting.  Have you seen those Verb commericals?  You know, with the verbs?  Basketball people playing around, with the word "run" flying through their legs, and then a brief picture of them saying "I love this verb."  Yeah, pretty lame, huh?  I had a better idea.  Howsabout adjective commercials?  You could have an obese, sweaty, bald ugly guy bending over to pick up the last french (oh, excuse me,  freedom ) fries that he had dropped while slobbering over them, and then, while in the process of heaving himself back atop his trunks of legs, he could raise the fries in his piggy fingers and, with a smile, say: "Fat."   It would help people with their grammar even more!  Wow!  Amazing!  Yesterday, during wellness, the kids there and I had a conversation regarding our various encounters with moving cars that we had thrown rocks at.  Some of us had recalled how the drivers had screeched their tires and come back to scream at them, leaving them to only hide in the nearest trench that they could find.  Apparently, one time somebody threw a rock so hard it cracked the windshield.  But, anyway, as this conversation was concluding, our teacher, who is what could be referred to as a femme-nazi, noticed that "only the boys do these kinds of things."  Earlier in the day, she had also mentioned how women were "winning the battle" against men.  It can be thus concluded that she seeks to dominate and enslave men, rather than be equals to them and be content with it.  If there are enough people like her on earth, then maybe we'd better start making them wear dresses again...heheh...just kidding....  I saw Adaptation with Jarrod and Lily on saturday.  It was phenomenal, one of the best films I've ever seen.  It was written by the same guy who did Being John Malkovich, or, to be more precise, written by and about the same guy.  So many things worked perfectly.  Auggh...it was just brilliant.  I finally finished an incredibly boring art project thing.  I also finished 1984.  What a depressing book.  Yet it is also paralyzingly incredible...  I had hoped, from the beginning of reading it, that Winston would overcome The Party and help bring the world back to the way it was, with capitalism and delusions of freedom, etc.  But, to no avail.  I've written almost twenty pages in Intertwine over the last three days.  I feel so awesome about doing so.  I leave you, then, with my quote of the day, which I murmured while walking away from the school bus, which I usually have to flee from, because of a complex heirarchy of needs and...nevermind...here it is....  "Fuck you, schoolbus."

      I'm going to post an exerpt from Intertwine, if you're interested, my dear reader--  Len Tournaugh III stood in his private den, his hands clasped behind his back, his thin body perched behind a window overlooking the city below.  He was a tall man, with graying hair, and his body gave the impression that it had once been greatly athletic, but with subsequent aging had been brought to near-feebleness.  Len was a very old man but showed his age well, several months ago he had turned ninety-seven, although he looked younger than sixty.  His kingdom had been one of majestic reform since its beginnings seventy years ago.  He had been one of the most powerful rulers in the history of Isardis.  But now, the pressure of it all was beginning to take effect upon his mind.  No longer could he think clearly.  At times, he relied upon his assistant, Ignav, a short stump of a man, to make his decisions for him.  Len knew that he was descending into death’s cradle, and although he was gradually going crazy he felt that he could finally relax and look back upon a very long life, a life as full as one of a politician possibly could be.  The world of men was unrecognizable from what it was before he came to power, and most of the change was caused by his reform.  He turned away from the window, to face Ignav, his assistant’s eyes bathed in the shadows of the room.  Len took a deep breath, and stared into those black sockets, black as if they were open holes into Ignav’s skull.  “Empires have a way of dissolving into the wind, like sand cast away from the hand, my dear Ignav.  I won’t let Isardis disintegrate when I’m gone.  And I can’t bother with all of the hassles of succession; none of them are followed anyway.  I have no heir and I intend to keep it that way.  There will be no civil war.  Isardis will change, like the rest of the world.  We will change into a republic.”  Ignav glared at him malevolently, his mouth frowned tightly, eyebrows almost perpendicular they were cast so low.  “You’ve truly lost your mind, majesty.  These republics—all of them, aren’t republics at all!  Gol Trachos is still ruled by an immortal man, Achamaeda is cannibalizing itself…my lord, if you were to pick a strong man to lead Isardis I assure you that it would not fall!  The other Empires are weakening under the guise of their democracy, soon each of them will be without armies and without a will to fight or govern.  The mere idea of republic is…is putrid and paralyzing in its stupidity.  Only Empire can work.”  “The possibility for abuse of the immense power I hold is too great to ignore, Ignav.  You know this.  A man may appear strong today, but if I were to die tomorrow then he could change immediately into a moron, an idiot, or a tyrant.  We can have none of those.”  He laughed, “we must assume, of course, that I am the perfect king, when comparing my rule to future ones.”  “Yes…we must.  My lord…whether or not we have a moron at the helm, we need fiefdom!  Of course there is the possibility for abuse of power, but that possibility is multiplied by as many representatives you would deem necessary for your senate!  The politicians bicker and quarrel over mundane differences while wars rage and people die!  Kings either cause those deaths or fight to prevent them.  At least, with an Empire, there is only one person to blame, my lord.”  “You are arguing that if ten thousand people were to die from the orders of a senate rather than a king,” said Len, “that the senate would be more at fault for the deaths than a king on his own?”  “Yes.  It sounds logical to me.”  “Well then you have much to learn.  I thought I knew you better.”  “I wasn’t aware that thinking was still an ability of yours, my lord.”  Len turned back to the window, to the lights of the city below.  “Dare not insult me in my own palace, Ignav.  At least with a senate, you can buy off your support if you make a mistake.  With a king, one misplaced word can result in immediate execution.  Do not test me.”  Ignav bowed, even though Len could not see it.  “My apologies, lord.  I—I was not thinking.”  “Hypocrites run rampant these days, don’t they, Ignav?”  “Yes, my lord, they do.”  “Go now,” he said, “I have memories to dally upon.”  In the pale shadows, Ignav bowed, and floated away, the enormous doors leading into the chamber closing crankily behind him.  The wailing of a horn drifted up through the currents of air from the necklace of bright lights below.  Len slumped in his chair, his eyes gradually losing focus, as he flew back and forth in his own fantasies.  So many memories, he thought, a phrase he found himself repeating quite often.  Almost a hundred years of data to sift through.  Where could he go?

      THE TALE OF VENATOR  Being the second part of THE PENDANT CYCLE    THE TALE OF VENATOR Being the second part of THE PENDANT CYCLE BY IAN SCHWARTZ I  An infinitely bright sun scaled a sky and cast an agony of light upon a barren and hopeless wasteland, of numerous jaws of serrated rocks snarling from a blackened earth.  Ravines and canyons rented a tortured landscape, where veins of lava had snaked and roared.  Demons and monsters of ferocity loped about its expanse, their widened jaws uttering praises and songs to a flapping beast in the sky, and the rider with a great horn atop it that would shriek with the rise of the sun.  Two years before this desert of despair came into being it had been a land of beauty and comfort, a place of shimmering trees and voluminous clouds, of singing children and running streams, of gentle breezes and soft, sleepy journeys from warm day into cozy night.  Simple stone huts would dot the top of a hill that nestled itself between flat expanses of golden farmland and verdigris fields of tall grass.  Only a single dirt road led away from the hill called by its inhabitants Ivlüvcatan (some gave it the shorter name of Ivlüv), only a single feeble cord of dirt to an outside world, where wars and politics and greed and lust raged like the grumbling stomachs of storm clouds.  To outsiders it was a petty retreat from revolution and empire.  Before it was reduced to the ruined expanse of today a baby was born in Ivlüvcatan to two happy parents, the father a thick bearded warrior who had settled from his fighting and the mother the cause of his doing so.  They named the baby Venator, a strange but not altogether uncommon name for a child, and then continued to live out their lives in lovely Ivlüv, the father hiding a secret urge to return to the battlefield before his increasing age locked him away with the surrounding serfs.  His father feared such a life, one devoid of adventure and rife with boredom, leaving him to look at most peasants with contempt in his graying eyes.  Venator’s earliest recollection of his father was of his upside-down cross-shaped pendant clinging to his chest and glimmering against the light of the sun.  His father had moved it one day, to show his young son a small tan mark that he said had been there ever since he had taken the pendant from the corpse of an old man.  His father would often sit atop a great boulder some distance from the town, quietly fingering the pendant, his mind dwelling on memories of battle and war, memories he longed to return to.  One day his eyes caught a great pair of flapping wings just over the horizon, and he felt his stomach lurch with fear.  A horn trumpeted, rattling the rock and the earth around it.  He knew it came from that thing, and fled in earnest, the pendant stinging at his neck.   The next day, several seasons after the birth of Venator, a horseman from Dardan galloped into the center of the town and eagerly requested that all citizens able to fight join in their lengthening war with the Barbins to the south.  Venator’s father stood from the crowd and shouted that he would join and help their cause, and the messenger soon recognized him, for his father was a great celebrity.  Without saying goodbye to the wife he loved or the son he cherished, his father rode away, his fingers eagerly clutching his faithful battleaxe, their edges white over the ornate scripture upon the hilt.  Something was amiss about his departure; he would not of done such a thing so carelessly and without consulting his family, even if his fantasies had dwelled on leaving for battle since his arrival into the boring life of a peasant.   Before he left the father of Venator tossed him his pendant, of which the very young boy wore over his neck, where it would gleam under only the sun like nothing crafted by the hands of any mere human.  At times Venator felt he could almost sense his father in the metal of the mercurial object, and as his fingers ran over its surface memories of the man he had loved ran through his mind in an unstoppable montage.  Years later, when Venator was a young man, only his father’s axe returned.  He had been struck down by a terrible monster, a creature that ravaged its helpless victims only in the chasm of night, a being of overwhelming evil and lust for delicious blood that dwelled in the deserts to the south.  Venator had grown wise even at his young age, and knew that he would have vengeance; he swore that he would, but he would have to wait until his body was ready for the task, for it was still weak and young.  He laid the battleaxe by his bedside and continued with his life, the weapon his investment for vengeance in the future, an object that ensured the memory of his pledge.  Late in the afternoon, when he was still young, Venator glimpsed the flapping beast over the horizon and through his window.  Although he should have felt afraid, like his father was, he felt no fear, no terror, as this thing was undoubtedly meant to instill dread beyond the wildest nightmares of the human psyche.  He could see a rider atop it, a terrible demon of pale skin, much larger than any man.  The pendant seemed to burn ever so slightly while the great wings flapped in the distance, and it continued to do so until it disappeared.  He rubbed his fingers over the surface of the pendant, and they stung briefly.  He thought of his father, looked to the battleaxe nearby, and remembered the pledge for vengeance.  “Fate often saves an undoomed man when his courage is good,” he said to himself, the sun setting in a bed of its own light outside his window, “my courage is good.”  A morning many years later a vast caravan of horses and wagons pounded their way through the fields of yellow autumn grass, the thumps of their horseshoes heard many hours before they arrived in the center of Ivlüv, where, later, money and items were eagerly exchanged between screaming buyers and their groping customers.  Venator heard the commotion and joined his fellow citizens, his body taking him to a fat and elderly shopkeeper who appeared to be lacking even the slightest interest in the surrounding horde of customers (several of whom were shouting angrily at him).  Venator asked him of the news from outside Ivlüv’s borders.  “The same wars still continue,” said the man as he coughed, viciously, “only they have newer names, since they halted for brief periods of peace every now and then, but the same people are still fighting over the same things.  You’re lucky to live in a province of Trachos that is far from the fighting; far from the hot wastelands to the south.”  Venator thought otherwise.  “Is your caravan heading to the desert?”  The toothless man widened his mouth with surprise.  “Why would you ever want to go there…from here?”  “I have my reasons,” he quickly replied.  There was a pause, and Venator’s keen eyes noticed an air about this man.  You are old, thought Venator, to himself.  The ugly lump of a man before him slumped with great age, the few strands of hair left on his gleaming scalp seemed too tired to even lift in the light breeze.  His skin had pulled itself tight over his body, excluding the grinning wrinkles on his face.  This body and this soul had seen more than many ever would, and it dawned upon Venator that he would never likely see so many years unfold before his eyes.  To die old was to die a coward.  The elderly man paused and then briefly grinned when Venator’s gaze refused to depart from his own.  “Oh, I see…well,” murmured the shopkeeper, his eyes retracted with thought, “we’ll be going there in a few months, our route is taking us around the entire empire, to every major port and city.  The province fighting the Barbins is called Barada, do you know of it?”  Venator nodded.  “It’s almost five hundred miles away, taking the shortest route, of course.”  “Well we don’t intend to do that.  It’ll take the caravan the better part of a year to get there, are you sure you want to go with us, you could probably find a faster way—”  “You’ve been the first visitors we’ve had in four months,” he interrupted.  The shopkeeper’s glazed eyes waited with thought, Venator stood patiently, the buyers continued to shout and push.  One of them threw a rock at the fat man, who caught the projectile and calmly hurled it back at the customer, who ducked and then scowled at him. “Alright…alright, I’ll take you along,” the man conceded, “You’ll have to earn your keep here, though, understand?”  Venator grinned with a satisfaction he hadn’t felt in a long time.  “Yes…yes absolutely.  I’ll be back in a few hours.  Don’t go anywhere.”   He departed with the crescent moon at his back from lovely Ivlüv that night, without mentioning his departure to his relatives or to his friends, the pendant’s glimmer waning after the sun set.  He had merely collected his clothes, a satchel to carry them, and his father’s axe—nothing more.  It wasn’t long before his mother realized that something was amiss, and she searched the town and the countryside for her son, for many days, and found nothing.  Two of her men had been lost.  Venator spent the year exploring the vast cities of Trachos, their towering skyscrapers and beautiful monuments to scholars and warriors alike never ceased to amaze him.  He never knew that such things could be built by humanity, he was in a state of sheer amazement as statues dozens of stories tall peered at him through the murky chasm of time, their stone hands wrapped firmly ‘round thick books or rifles or swords, some with playful grins on their faces, as if to mock the various absurdities of their lives, others with scowls or screaming lips stretching the folds of their stone skin.  While rubbing the metal of the pendant one cold winter evening Venator remembered that his father had told him once a story of the Titans (of which these statues reminded him) when he was very young. They had been giants since birth and roamed the earth long before man or beast ever did, their footsteps could shake the snow from mountaintops.  Their hands worked the land, they churned lakes from mudflats, spread carpets of deserts over floors of rock, puffed clouds from their pipes, and the sweat from their labor beaded down upon their creations and forced verdant life to emerge from inky lifelessness.  When the earth was ready for the coming animals, the titans rested from their work and pulled blankets of land over their bodies to warm them on their journeys into permanent rest.  Their eyes closed and as the sun and moon took turns racing across the sky their skin gradually solidified.  Sometimes the hills that they slept under would break apart from flood or downpour, and their faces would peek out into their creation once again, their heavy stone eyelids would open and their pupils would flick back and forth with wonder until the land closed up once again.  The land the titans forged had been reduced to ash by a horde of demons that came from a volcano, according to his father at least, and for a time the world was an unnatural furnace, where venomous miasmas wafted about in the air like clouds, and the ground was stale with charred rock.  Humanity had nearly perished, but a hero from the ash emerged, and somehow, through means indeterminable, brought back the world into the green glory it had once been, brought back life and happiness.  He had perished, some said, only several decades ago.  But no one knew for sure. In his dreams Venator would see the great pair of flapping, gothic wings, and would hear the call of whatever rode upon them.  He would see them just above a sun-scarred horizon, and feel the earth shake with the screech of the rider’s horn.  In his dream Venator looked down to his neck, to the pendant, and lifted it to his eyes.  The metal would glow with an eerie blue, and the scream would grow painfully louder.  Venator would awake in a cold sweat, his fingers rubbing the metal of the pendant at his neck, sometimes touching the upside-down cross-shaped tan on his neck that had formed over the years. Venator once stood upon the wintry streets of Mourglis, a grand city, and whirled about in astonishment as a mechanical coach rolled past, its wealthy occupants waving to him as the machine’s wake of wind bit at his exposed cheeks.  More people than he had ever seen in his life bobbed about the city streets, their visible breath mixing with the steam that fissured out from the sewers.  He could stand still and crane his neck back as far as it would go and still not see the top of the towering citadels of stone they called skyscrapers, he would bend backwards and slip upon the snow and ice in front of the thousands of people around him that lived with these wonders daily.  To Venator, this brief period was the most interesting in his life.  But the bane of humanity, nor his want to end its miserable life, did not go away.  He heard rumors about the caravan of a monstrous creature terrorizing the armies of Trachos on their way to the various forts and cities that peppered the nurturing liquids of the Silvestris River (the only source of water in the Baradan Desert), that even the columns of armored pike men and musketeers could not keep it from stealing away a random guard or a sentry every other night, always after the moon set.  As time inexorably progressed Venator found himself closer and closer to Barada, the air became stale and dry, the sweltering sun filled the sky and all traces of greenery disappeared.  They reached the delta of the Silvestris River and stopped in the small village of Decarideres, a quaint place surrounded by an aging wall and consisting of little more than mudbrick homesteads.  A neglected field of blackened, dried vegetables had greeted them just before they passed through the gate to the town within.  Venator quickly noticed that there were no children or adolescents anywhere to be found, and that the few adults seemed both saddened and depressed.  After thanking and saying his goodbyes to the shopkeeper and the people who had taken him to this land Venator stopped in the only shop in town and asked a balding, middle-aged man in the process of purchasing a box of crackers why everyone was so depressed. “For two months he came after the moon set,” the man murmured under the white stubble surrounding his lips, as he turned to face Venator, “he demanded that he give us a child every night, and we of course said no, and he attacked and killed so many…and then he took the children all at once and we heard them screaming over the dunes and we were powerless…the next morning we looked for them and found only a trail of footprints heading south, along the river, always along the river…” He trailed off, his teared eyes retracted with memory, his lips quivering with intense despair.  Venator didn’t bother to inquire further.  He waited for the shaken man to make his purchase and then bought a good deal of canned foods to put in the satchel he had taken from his home.  The day continued, the eye of the sun glared down upon the disheartened inhabitants of Decarideres, the shadows stretched and the arid heavens blazed to orange before the first stars began to peek out from behind the thinning veil of sky.  Venator had napped until then, and he awoke with a start and left the dreary town without saying anything to anyone.  With a shiver he pulled his cloak out of his satchel as he strolled quietly along the frothing banks of the Silvestris, the sand still very warm even with the nipping cold of the night.  He turned back to see the glowing moon hovering just above the horizon, its journey almost complete.	  II  Hours passed, only the gurgling of the river broke the silence.  In the twilight gloom the reeds that dotted the Silvestris could be seen, and very far ahead, where the waterway sliced through the duned horizon a vast column of troopers marched, their pikes pointed to the stars, their rifles angled upon their shoulders.  In the murk their armored helmets and bodypieces reflected, their boots plodded through the sand and they were all silent with weariness.  To Venator it appeared as if they had been marching since at least the night before.  He crept closer to the column, which was traveling the same direction down the river as he was, and hid behind a wet hill of fluttering reeds that had sprouted from the warm sand.  The pendant around his neck remained quiet.  His eyes peered through soft susurrus.  They ceased walking and bivouacked, their outer pikes pointed away from a center circle, each knight resting upon the bed of desert, one that beckoned sleep.  Venator heard them speaking in an odd tongue, its sound akin to raking claws or nightmarish dreams.  He listened for a good deal of time and concluded that these men were not Trachan: they were savage Barbins.  He pulled his gaze back from the whispers of the boughs and glanced at his left breast long enough to see the skin thrumming above his heart, before his curiosity forced him to return to the resting soldiers ahead.  As long as they remained he could not continue on his journey; there was no doubt in his mind that they had posted sentries for miles around, that even the slightest movement would trigger immediate response.  They hadn’t unloaded their tents or their supplies for that reason alone: according to rumor, they were always attacked at night.  Venator’s eyes pawed over their armor and the strange language upon it, how their skulls had lower brows and deep shadows over their eyes, the skin had been pulled tightly over exaggerated features—  The crack of a branch ceased his train of thought.  Venator’s racing heart sped faster, his ears now vibrated in sync with his breast.  Ever so slowly he craned his head to the origination of the sound, his body taut, but fingers sliding over the hilt of his axe.  He may have been discovered by a sentry, or a wayworn guard out to relieve a tightened bladder.  Something had moved.  The reeds washed about with each other in the crepuscular twilight, the wind was blowing harder now.  He could never fight off a division this large, if he ran into the open their rifles would cut him to shreds and if he remained on the river the same fate surely awaited him.  With lidless eyes the stars glared. 	 His eyes were now focused upon a smaller hill several dozen feet away, but there appeared to be nothing besides the rustling reeds about its circumference.  He was sure that the sound had originated from that one spot, and knew that it was impossible for it to have been created by anything but a living creature.  Not a gust of wind, not a drop of rain, no: this was an animal.  He continued to focus and remained absolutely still, his muscles both burning and trembling with the challenge.  Eventually, however, Venator found that in this riverbed he was not accompanied by a soldier, or a small lizard, or a sentry.  Rather, the object of all of his fears, desires, and hates had manifested itself within striking range.  In Venator’s eyes a pair of pupils tightened.  Its muscles rippled under dark flesh, it wore no clothing and was the size of a tall and strong man.  Its hair was scraggly and long, kobold marks on the thing’s skin made it look even more gruesome.  He could hear it breathing; hear the snorting of its breath between mucus-clogged nostrils.  It was kneeling behind the reeds and appeared to be scouting out the bivouac.  A tongue behind yellow and triangular teeth slathered saliva about, Venator could see it move back and forth under the creature’s cheek like the crest of a wave on a smooth ocean surface.  With each exhalation from its mouth a whispered jargon of words thrashed about currents of grunting and growling.  It clutched no weapon between its tightened fingers, but stains of blackened blood had cracked and dried all around his hands, it was clear that this thing needed no weapon but what nature gave it.    Venator prepared to fight the thing.  He began to lift himself to his full height, his head rising above the swirling reeds.  The quiet background chorus of tenebrous, hardly human language continued.  And as Venator lifted his axe, as he widened his legs for running, the creature screamed a sound he would never forget and loped high into the dark air, its jump taking it well over the outward pikes of the bivouac and into the inner throng of unsuspecting Barbins.  He watched with horror as the thing clawed its way through the crowd of troopers, their swords and shields hacking in its direction but yielding no effect.  It tossed men about with its rank claws; they flew about high in the air before the desert smothered their screams.  Its roars climbed high into the sky like the soldiers that he hurled, and the blood of its victims began to fling about the terrified soldiers, the ones lacking guns backing away from a small, inner arena and the ones with guns too terrified to fire them.  What appeared to be one of the living leaders gathered his riflemen and had them discharge their weapons at the creature with a downward swing of his sword, but it ducked to the sand in an imperceptible blur and the speeding pellets struck the soldiers behind it.  When the thing rose, its eyes peered right through the eyes of the soldier that had made that order, and with one final scream it scuttled forth and picked the man up in its mouth, its teeth closing over his writhing neck and quickly ceasing its movement with a painfully audible crack.  It hurled itself into the sky once more and disappeared among the roars and gas clouds of rifles, the soldiers not bothering to go off after their leader.  After this attack the survivors slept with ease, for they knew he would not come back for yet another sublunary light.  III  Within a blanket of orange the sun peeked above the horizon and the stars were smothered.  Venator found his eyes weary, for they had been following the easily traceable footprints of the creature since it had scrambled away from the encampment of soldiers; he had been doing so for the whole of the night.  It had been easy for him to slip away in the confusion, under the fog of their roaring and flashing gunpowder.  Its feet seemed eerily human, he could hardly tell the difference between the thing’s tracks and his own, when compared.  The sun climbed the lens of the sky and Venator’s shadow became nonexistent, the weight of the heat was beginning to become unbearable for the young man.  As he began to comprehend resting his eyes spotted a blip of dark light on the horizon, and with a last bit of strength he jogged toward it.  His eyelids expanded, his eyebrows sprung upward, and he retched violently, for, in front of him a red skeleton had been nearly picked clean, its shards of clothing and bits of meat scattered about a bloody crater encircling its desperation.  Venator recovered and sipped a bit of his scalding water before draping a shirt over his face and drifting into sleep, his last thought questioning his decision to come to Barada, to exact vengeance upon the terrible beast that had slain his father.  The sun fell, the sky darkened and the moon drifted silently from the horizon.  Venator awoke, rested, and found his water to be cool with the absence of the extreme desert heat.  He took off in a run, his shoes removed, muscles straining but not painfully.  The tracks never changed their course, from a straight line: they remained steady and perpetual, and in the faint gloom Venator could see that they stretched far into the stolid horizon.  His endurance never left him, as if the hand of a spirit was continuously urging him on, and Venator soon heard the warsongs of the same platoon he had encountered the night before wafting about with the midnight breeze.  He could see their ranks, faintly, there and as he watched and continued to jog he saw a series of flashes, and then seconds later heard colossal booms in sync with each other; a cloud of fog began to obscure the flickering stars just above them.  The creature was attacking.  Venator turned toward them and sprinted as fast as his legs would carry him, his feet thumping in the sand, arms waving back and forth in rhythm, sweat-dewed hair pushed behind his brow by the wind.  He neared their ranks, and found himself in the open, with nowhere to hide, and so he dropped to the ground, his breath coming in agonizing gasps.  He waited, then, and hoped that they would not notice his mistake of coming too near, but he did not have much time to do so.  The pendant burned at his collarbone, but he ignored it.  A plume of sand burst from the desert near his arm, a chorus of gun blasts roared in his direction, and he felt the air around him pinch with bullets.  He stood and darted away from them, his hand automatically pulled his axe from its place at his back, and he felt an unknown force order it to swing about to block his head.  A spark burst from its metal and a screech burned his ears; he had deflected one of their metal projectiles.  His eyes then glanced through their ranks, and he watched one of the riflemen fall over backwards, his hand clutching his breast.  Venator quickly felt a kind of ecstasy envelop him, he felt an urge stream through his veins, and so he acted upon a new thirst in his life, and altered his course, to take his body toward the throng of soldiers.  He felt his heart quicken and thrum like it had never before, his pupils shrunk away to leave his green, glowering iris’, his tongue lapped about his saliva-drenched mouth.  The last flecks of consciousness left him, he was pure instinct now.  The pendant burned.  He spent the late hours of the night throwing himself at them, his axe hacking through their limbs, its blade drenched in their entrails and their bodily fluids.  Their guns bucked and screamed at him, he split them apart, their swords rose and swung at him, he shattered their metal, their shields rose to defend themselves, and he kicked them away with his foot, to leave his axe embedded in their necks, before it would be withdrawn to strike again and sever another piece of flesh from another body, from another foe.  They were all his enemies.  Until daytime Venator killed, and at daytime he followed the last survivor of the Barbin platoon as he fled to the top of a tall dune, the morning sun casting a corona atop its peak, and leaving the man’s body nothing more than a mere silhouette.  The soldier was skilled, obviously, and he held a single pistol, which he bravely discharged at Venator, who merely swung his head to the side, the bullet swishing the air about his ear.  With a widened look in his eye the man turned to flee down the other end of the dune, but Venator’s axe found him first, the blade hurled from a great distance, its soaked surface digging into his spine.  The soldier gasped and lost all control of his body, with his nerves being cut like strands of spider silk.  He tumbled down the dune until a roll catapulted him into the air and threw all of his weight upon his neck, which cracked eerily, like the neck of their leader that had been carried off the night before.  At this thought Venator found himself withdrawing from his gluttonous ecstasy, and soon he was himself again.  He thought the obvious.  “What have I done?”   With horror replacing the lust that had been bursting through his veins Venator lost his balance and fell backward from the top of the dune, back to the bloodied graveyard of men he had created.  As he recovered his eyes found the cleaved corpses that had been impaled by his axe, he found their limbs strewn wildly about their bodies, their blood in thick puddles that had not yet been absorbed by the sand.  His mouth widened with horror and he backed away on all fours, his eyes found his hands and he recoiled again with fear, for they were caked with their insides, and with his chest knotting and wrapping round itself he shoved his hands into the desert, he felt the shell of hardened blood pick itself away as his eyes cried tears.  Minutes later, he withdrew his hands, and they were clean.  He looked back to the top of the dune, to where the forehead of the sun was peeking, and he dashed toward it, his weary muscles burning.  When he reached the top he hurled himself over the edge, the sand washing about his skin and his bloodied tunic, the grains gritting through his ears and his hair.  He slid to the bottom, his body resting against the new corpse of the last soldier he had killed.  With his face in an intense grimace Venator stood, leaned forward and grasped the handle of the axe, and with all of his remaining might withdrew it, the metal edge doused in the man’s insides.  With the weapon in his hand, with the new blood running atop his hands, Venator gazed at the metal of the axe glinting off of the bright sun, watched it roll back and forth like a thick cream, until he was immediately reminded of a distant memory of his childhood.  His father’s pendant.  Glimmering in the sun.  Venator reached for the shiny object around his neck, felt it between his fingers, then pulled it above his head.  He dropped his axe into the sand and pulled it to his eyes, where they roamed over its surface.  It was little more than a cross, its metal, however, was made of an unknown material (he remembered his father telling him this) that brightened especially in the sun.  With curiosity replacing terror Venator lifted the pendant to the sky and bathed it in the sunlight, where it brightened and brightened, its light growing to beyond that of the sun itself.  He turned his head away, covered his eyes with his free arm and charged up the dune, where he waved the device back and forth, its light casting deep shadows over the cresting waves of the desert.  He would lure the thing here.  He would kill it here.  He would do so now.   There it was.  Savagely loping toward him from the distance, in the afternoon gleam of the sun, and in the afternoon gleam of Venator’s pendant, the creature came, its body moving on all four of its muscular appendages, its eyes staring curiously at the waving light that had attracted it here.  It jumped the canyons between the dunes; it passed through the air above the bloodied graveyard below and landed mere feet from Venator, who tucked the pendant back into its position around his neck.  Their eyes met and remained focused upon each other.  Venator bared his gritted teeth.  The creature clenched its muscles.  Venator brought his axe through the air and swung it at the thing.  The creature dodged the metal of the axe and kicked it out of the boy’s hands.  Its clawed fists shredded the air, its body bolted forth and its mouth widened in anticipation of Venator’s neck.  Venator ducked and hurled his fist into the thing’s stomach, catapulting it high into the air, where its limbs waved with surprise.  Its body disappeared from view, over the edge of the dune.  Venator’s eyes glared at his axe, he stretched out his hand, and his weapon flew through the air to return to his fingers, which tightened at the new arrival.  He felt the pendant at his neck sting, but ignored it.  Venator pumped his legs to the edge of the dune and then reduced his speed to a walk, where, moments later he met up with the huddled body of the animal, motionless on the arid desert carpet only several feet in front of him.  Wasting no time, he threw forward the axe with his hand still clenching it.  Its metal tasted only sand.  In an instant the thing rolled away, sprang into the air and smashed its fist against Venator’s stomach. The boy screamed and tightened his eyelids.  He fell to his knees and the creature grinned with its victory.  It slowly brought its widened mouth to Venator’s neck, its triangular teeth ready to pierce flesh, ready to draw blood.  Its eyes closed with an ecstasy enveloping its body, it readied itself for the kill, its fists balled.    In an instant, then, Venator’s hand found his axe.  In an instant, the creature’s head lay in the sand at Venator’s side, its body rolling down the dune, muscles quivering.  Venator’s fingers picked the head up from the sand, and he approached the body, where it had stopped, and he examined it.  The skin was tanned, but quickly paling, and other than the scratches and kobold marks Venator found a single white indentation just below its neck.  Its upside-down cross shape was identical to Venator’s pendant.  Identical.  The thing could only be his father.  He dropped the axe.  He dropped the head.  His body dropped to the sand.   Like his father, what had been Venator’s soul was swallowed by the pendant, nothing further of Venator’s heroism remained beneath his muscles, even though they still lived and thrummed with the pumping of his heart.  A great shriek sounded from a horn, one that vibrated the sand and shook it from its foundations.  Just over the white horizon a pair of great, wide wings flapped, and from atop the rider who stole souls through the pendant sat, a grin on his horrible face.  After so much waiting, after the new world’s creation many thousands of years ago the demons could arise again, and through the boy’s body the fires of Chthon would rise as they had in antediluvian seasons now passed.   It was over a year later that Venator’s body returned to Ivlüvcatan.  It walked without thought behind it, its clothes tattered, hair disheveled, body tight with starvation.  The stirring grass paused to watch him approach.  Storm clouds fled from the sky, but could not run fast enough on the wind.  Ivlüv was dark even in midafternoon, the verdant trees and verdant fields had grown darker with the black undersides of the clouds.  War had wreaked havoc across the lands that bordered this place, but like always before, the soldiers and the conquerors never found their way here, by some magic or by some luck or a combination of the two.  The town remained untouched, remained, as it had been when Venator had departed from it two years earlier.  The wind billowed.  Venator walked through the dirt streets, his feet without shoes.  His despondent mother saw him walking there, her heart leaped, her insides roiled, and she ran toward him, her dress trailing behind her and fluttering in the wind.  She clutched him, shouted at his bare, soulless face, but garnered no response.  A crowd had soon gathered to watch.  After trying to awaken him from his slumber, or whatever state he was in, for the better part of an hour she fell silent, her eyes merely content to rejoice in the image of her son.  She pulled him toward her body and hugged him tightly, hugged him like she had never hugged anyone before.  Every day she had been miserable since his departure.  Not one passed without her wondering if he was still alive.  Venator’s mouth widened and from his neck a scream burst the silence of the town, his veins tightened on his forehead, on his neck, his eyes widened, even though there was no soul behind them.  The blood flying through his veins began to heat.  They burst to an inferno, the town disintegrated in a tall blaze of hell, the province bathed in flame.  The people were thrown away, their skin burned to leave brittle, black skeletons.  Ivlüvcatan withered, its prairies now deserts of rock, the sky devoid of moisture, veins of lava from far below gurgling angrily.  It was not long before the Europe, Asia, and the rest of the world followed, leaving the demons to reawaken and thrive as they had before, their master’s gothic wings flapping in the sky, his horn trumpeting through the wafting miasmas of poison.  The following morning, the sun, infinitely bright, cast an agony of light upon the barren and hopeless wasteland… And of humanity, only the pendant remained.

      THE TALE OF HEOROGAR  Being the first part of THE PENDANT CYCLE  I              See.  The great eras are coming to an end; the old knights and the old kings are sliding their blades to their scabbards and withering away under their bedcovers.  Acrid fog that stings the eyes has crept in from distant lands, and what traditions the people still cling to are slipping away, beyond memory.  In Hyldethrith, a small city of thatched roofs and wafting smoke pillars, nestled between two great verdant cliffs, a small island of humanity lays, the lands around it burning or smoldering from the breath of demons and their servants.  The food, already coarse and stale, is slowly being ebbed away by the quiet survivors of the onslaught, who know not why fate has spared them from the carnage that has purged the surrounding lands of life.  Their tradition, their speech, their thoughts, are declining, and the years pass by.  See Hyldethrith, the last bastion of humanity.              From the ash came Heorogar.              A small boy spotted him while picking grass to eat on the top of one of the cliffs.  Heorogar was a strong and tall man, his hair disheveled, body smudged with soot, clothes tattered and flying about wildly in the hot wind.  He weaved through the tortured rents and canyons, toward the verdant, frowned cliffs, his hand shielding his eyes from the gas that stung and reddened them.  By the time he reached the blackened town gate the survivors were already crowded behind its locked doors.  An old and withered man wearing a brown tunic and a metal helmet stood above the gargantuan, wooden door on a thin walkway, his bodyweight leaning on a rusted sword.                "Who goes thel?"  he shouted, his voice cracked and dry.              "Heorogar, Knight of Gadden," came the reply, "only to seek brief lodgings."              A pause.  "Gadden…my mind may be glowing lessel, but still, aye 'ave heard naught o' such a place, en any fable 'r map 'r mention.  How came you heel?"              "Don't know," said Heorogar, looking up to the old man and smiling, "don't know where I am or how came I here."              "I saw him!"  shouted the thin child, from behind the gate, "he was wandering the ashes, he came right toward us he did!  I saw him!"              "Folgive me fel no' believing you, Sil' Helogaul," said the old man, lifting his cap from his brow, "'aye shall ask again: how came you heel?"              "I only remember falling asleep in Gadden, the night was cold, everything was as normal as it could be…and then, I was at your gate.  Please, let me in, I have no weapons, and I would do you no harm. What could it gain me?"              "We 'ave li'le food ta spail…oul stomachs al full o' glass, tha es all.  We 'ave plen'y o' space, though, tha's one thing we seem only ta gain, as the yeals go by…"              "Please, let me in, then we may speak of what has befallen these lands!"               The withered man nodded and the gate was opened.  Heorogar stepped through, and his eyes met the village they told him was called Hyldethrith.  It was a step up from the venomous miasmas that wafted about in the greater beyond, but hardly one at that.  Its homes were falling into disrepair, its people so thin and tired that it looked an arduous labor to merely stand upon their own legs.  They led him into a tavern that appeared to have lost its name, and when Heorogar asked why, the old man, who now became a bit more eccentric, told him that since "no 'un hahdly speaks no 'un remembels."  Even though their eyes—all of them—were sunk deep into their sockets, and their bodies were starved of food, the smiling people seemed excited to see him, and Heorogar did not blame them.  The old man, who called himself Cryda, led him inside, where they sat at a table by a cold fireplace.  Heorogar found a bookshelf packed with documents and tomes, and he immediately set about reading them as Cryda watched anxiously.                    "No 'un remembels," repeated Cryda, "noh' eaven how ta leed."              "Gadden should be right here," said Heorogar, pointing to a spot on the map, near its edge and on the Mar Atlantic, "it's a huge city.  What did you say the name of this place was?"              "Hyldethrith, oldest city o' the Nothe."              "Hyldethrith," murmured Heorogar, "Hyldethrith…I know I've heard of it."                Heorogar flipped through the thick pages, past the large and ornate text, arriving at a place he seemed to be satisfied with.  After some staring at it, his face grew to one of grim disbelief.  "No, no, that can't be."              "Wuh?"  asked Cryda.               "Gadden,” he read, “small, coastal fishing community.  Population five hundred."              "Aye know noh' the meanings o' those wolds…"              "Gadden was the jewel of its age…it could not have declined into its current state, it would have garnered more mention, surely…” he scratched his chin, "we conquered most of what's on this map, I was there, I know it, I did it!  And yet…this encyclopedia says nothing of it!"              With that, he pawed through more books and more papers, sighing and banging the table after the books told him the same conclusion over and over again.  If mentioned at all, Gadden had been no more than a small fishing village, with nothing remarkable about it to set itself apart from the thousands of other villages that dotted the European coastline.  But Heorogar knew it was something far greater.  He had lived there his whole life, under the shadow of its stone pantheons and citadels, beside the clopping hooves of the King's cavalry, a cavalry that was to become his own.  He had fallen in love with a beautiful princess from the east—but it was all gone.    Heorogar at last gave up and slumped in his chair.  His eyes slumped with his body.              "Evelything on this heel map es ash an' dust," said Cryda, "we knoow it."              "How do you know it, old man?" he asked, "have you been across these lands, and seen the desolation yourself?  Have you?"              Cryda nodded.  "Aye have.  Aye was with the almy that was suppoosed ta' fight them back.  We had many thoosands at oul' flanks, many men an' swolds an' shields an' almols yondel-all blought togethel ta' defend these heel lands that we have held flom the thlats flom below.  They came out o' a volcano, gleat demons, some with wings, each belching flame, they shledded me' flends an' the many that aye did not knoow too!  Aye fled the battle, the sky climson at me' back a' night, the flames risin' ovel the holizon.  Aye came back to me' home, an' days latel the demons alayved, theil foul ranks somehoow missed Hyldethlith, an' the lands alound us wel bulned en a holocaust aye shall nevel folget.  Aye wandeled the fiely lands, then, looked fel anee sulvivols, looked fel many yeals, but found none.  Thel al' none.  Flom heel ta' the edge o' China ta' the tip of Aflica to the Mar Atlantic thel es oonly ash an' dust."              "I-I won't believe it," said Heorogar, "…impossible…"              Cryda's icy eyes pierced Heorogar's.  "En time, you will daye, as will daye, en this blasted hearth.  You'll kill youlself o' you'll lack the strength ta' do so, it mattels naught.  Wha's mol: it'll happen soon."  Cryda began to laugh.  "Oul food won't last the yuletide."              Heorogar's eyes scattered.  "What…has happened to me…why am I here…what have I done?"              "Fate es the only answel ta' evely question."              II              It was a time when snow should have fallen.  In its stead the cold was replaced by the sweltering heat of what seemed like a thousand suns, so painful to the people of Hyldethrith that the weight of it all forced them to their knees.  The sky throbbed with an orange red at every second of the day, regardless of the position of the sun.  Cryda lay on the stale earth, his arms stretched into the air, fingers widened and quivering.  His face was taught with starvation and clung to the bones of his skull, his skin bled dry of its sweat long ago.  His eyes glared at the sun, and the sun glared back.              "Vengeance!"  his lips mouthed without sound, before he collapsed, his eyes rolling back to his head, his heart ceasing to toil, allowing him to rest forever.              By his side, his rusted sword lay, and Heorogar's eyes were upon it.  By this time his muscles had melted into his skin, and his mind was racing with hunger and frustration.  "No," he said, to himself, "no, no I won't."              Disobeying his command, his body crept forward, and his thin arm heaved the sword into the air, its metal reflecting the tyrannical hues and shades of the sky.  He looked at Cryda's body and the thin veil of skin clinging to it that he could devour.  Then his eyes wandered back to his own body, to his stomach.              "Would only be a…short-term help…anyway," he murmured, referring to the meat upon Cryda, the sword's point gradually angling itself toward his neck.  "To end life before I cannot—or to relish what misery I have left?"              A scream in the sky averted his attention, and he looked to the hot, crimson clouds, his eyes picking out a pair of flapping wings just over the blurred horizon.  It was then that at the end of the despondent street he stood upon a glimmer of light caught his eye.  Forgetting the winged thing, he shielded his eyes from the glimmer and dropped the sword back to the ground.  He strode toward it, his body angrily protesting every movement he made.  The glimmer faded as he approached, and he bent toward the stale dirt to find a mercurial cross the size of a fingernail.  Pendant, he thought, it's a pendant, not a cross.  He picked it up, felt its nonexistent weight in his hand, its thin chain drooping in the air.  Heorogar slung it over his neck.  His stature straightened.  His coarse hair lengthened and thickened and darkened from the early gray brought on by the starvation, and the small white hairs that had sprung from the pores on his body fell away.  His muscles widened and grew, his stomach was immediately full.  His eyes soared with life, and he inhaled the acrid gas as if it were voluptuous oxygen.              "Alive!" he screamed, "I live!"              Heorogar rushed back and forth among the empty streets of Hyldethrith like a giddy child, searching for anyone he could help by this curious wonder he had procured.  By this time the skies had melted from their blood color to a sickly, cloudless viridian, and the air tasted of foul ammonia.  But as Heorogar sprinted from doorway to doorway and street-to-street he tasted it naught, instead feeling eccentrically lively.  Many hours passed and he was still running as fast as his legs would carry him, covering most of the small city, finding only skin-draped skeletons in his quest for someone to save.  But in Hyldethrith, in this hell of hells, he found nothing alive.  Even the grass had browned over and perished in the billowing tides of poison.              And so, slipping the rusted sword into its scabbard, a thing he later procured from Cryda’s corpse, he departed the solemn place for the wastes of the rest of the world, in all of their volcanic misery.  With a corona of fiery light whipping above the rocky skins of the earth at his back Heorogar made off into the desert of decay, of charred rock and snarling rivers of magma.  His pendant stuck to his neck and, with its power, the feelings of discomfort and hunger rarely, if ever entered his mind or his body.  Weeks passed, the world gradually grew quiet, and the volcanoes that pumped the air full of noxious fumes began to die down into tentative slumber, waiting for any calls their masters would make in the future.  During his travels Heorogar found a small dale among the plates of black rock and, deciding to spend the night there, he made his way down among the teeth of its jaw, as the light of the sun waned in the green-tinted heavens.  He found a smooth surface and lay there, his eyes gradually closing even though the light of a perpetual day was still above him.              He dreamed of the Towers of Gadden, gleaming in silvery delight as the sun’s forehead rose above the shoulders of the earth.  He was back home, in his great Citadel, his eyes roaming the bustling city streets below—the flame dancers, the shouting merchants, the actors, the jugglers—so much was occurring at even such an early hour.  From behind, he felt the presence of his wife.  His heart melted, though his eyes did not glimpse her.  He only knew she was there.  Knowledge of such a thing was power enough.               He awoke hours later and noted immediately that it was no longer bright.  It was, in fact, dark, for the first time since he had been taken from his home in Gadden.  But the sight soon passed, and once again he was bathed in sunlight, the sun itself making a rare appearance from above the thick vapors of poisonous fog.  He looked toward the sun, to see what had caused the obstruction (he knew it not to be a cloud) and instead glimpsed a small speck in the sky, black in color, and moving very quickly across it.  A new terror to liven up life, he thought to himself as he slowly drew his sword, the metal shining brightly with his pendant in the sunlight.  Pregnant seconds passed, and, quite abruptly the ground shook with the screech of a terrible horn, surely wrought with evil hands.  Heorogar ducked away from the light of the sun although his sword was still bathed in it, and the call came again, likely, he thought, from that speck above.                A roar in the distance answered it.              With the clawed, foul feet of only a monster, the ground began to tremor.              The speck in the sky had now grown considerably, and Heorogar's keen eyes could pick out wide, black wings pumping steadily in the air.  Whatever you are, foul thing, you return, he thought to himself.  The tremors grew louder and faster, they sounded more like gallops than trots, and Heorogar, feeding his insatiable curiosity, peeked above the dale he stood within.  He quickly fell back, nearly slipping upon the rocks, his heart pounding loudly in his chest.  His fingers tightened upon his sword, and his breath came in haggard gasps.  He could only feel terror, both in his mind and in his quivering limbs.  Once again circumstance forced him to forget the distant, flapping thing in the sky.              For an enormous, four legged beast of black scales and horned hides was galloping toward him.  The thing looked to be taller than three stories and was longer than any galleon Heorogar had ever seen.  From its upper jaw long, jagged teeth sprouted, even with its mouth closed, and its glowing blue eyes had a look of savage gluttony that Heorogar had never before glimpsed in his life.  A Miragon.  Ere I never felt such fear.  His eyes flicked about the dale for a cleft or hole to hide in, but there was none.  He was trapped, and the beast was nearly on top of him.  What a horrific end for the last Knight of Gadden, he thought to himself, miserably.  Sweat clung to his body and beaded about his face, he felt only despair in the moisture his body produced, felt his stomach tightening painfully.  Such men as I, he thought, should not feel such fear.                A feeling he could not explain began to flow through Heorogar’s body, one which erased the widespread thoughts of terror and replaced them with a primeval lust for blood and for destruction.  He tensed his muscles and he raised his rusted sword into the air, grunting insatiably all the while.  His free hand gripped the top of the ravine and hoisted him with incredible force above the top, into the wasteland once more, where he faced the Miragon, which had neared him to within twenty feet.  His eyes met its eyes, and they locked together, both pairs of them bathed in utter hatred for the other.  With the pendant stinging at his neck, Heorogar raised his sword higher still and charged the enormous, sky-dominating beast.                The Miragon’s jaws widened, and it smote the air with thick, vaporous flame in a canorous screech, the pillar of it overtaking Heorogar and reducing him to nothingness.  Cryda’s sword and the singed, severed hand that clutched it with undying zeal clattered to the blackened rock.  The Miragon lifted its carriage-sized head and belched a churning tower of smoke and fiery wrath into the green-tinted sky, its primitive gesture of victory.  The wide, pumping wings of the distant flying creature (the only parts of it visible) wheeled about, and it continued upon its original course, passing in front of the sun as it had only minutes before.  Soon the bleak world went on as it had without Heorogar the traveler, and where he had stood only his pendant remained.              Fate was merciful to Heorogar, who saw only for an instant the seething wall of inferno, who felt only for an instant its tongues of heat lapping incessantly upon his immured skin.  His reality was there, and then it was gone.  Heorogar fell into a verdant haze of dreams, and thrashed about wildly within them, his muscles too busy with fighting the currents to allow his mind to think.  In this void he began to suffocate, and at last he gave up, inhaling the thick fumes and globules, his body sagging in the mist.  The fluid around Heorogar began to tug at him, and his feet rested calmly upon a rocky surface as the vapors were drained away by an unknown force.                His body abruptly burst to life, and he retched violently, his lungs angrily forcing the thick mucus’ out onto the charred stone.  Heorogar coughed and clawed at the rock with his fingernails, his eager body clamoring for air.  After awhile he calmed and was content to lay there, sucking in the poisonous fumes, his insides fighting for the little oxygen that could be gleaned from the gasses that threaded about him.  Still coughing, his hands searched in the haze for the pendant, and quickly made contact with its chain.  Heorogar immediately thrust it over his neck and sucked in the thick joy that now suddenly surrounded him.  Quickly he was content.              He immediately found that where he stood was indeed the place that he had died.  The rock around him was hot and charred black, its crater extending for many meters.  His sword lay on the crater’s perimeter, and Heorogar noticed his own, severed hand clutching it.  He checked his right wrist and smoothed his fingers over his own skin, to ensure that it was indeed real.  Something quite incredible had occurred—Heorogar was alive.  He felt a happiness unlike any other he had experienced envelop him, it throbbed through him, now, and he fell to his naked knees, his hands pressing against the rock.  He laughed aloud.              A great wind picked up, and the gasses flew away from where Heorogar stood.  All of the sky, except for the sickly blurred horizon, was now blue, and the crescent moon hung lazily above it.  From his whitened fingertips grass speared from a browning earth and swiftly covered the land, stretching into the horizon in grand, dew-glimmered carpets.  The sky thickened with storm clouds that gathered themselves from nowhere, and the lightening from within them crackled as a downpour drenched the world.  Trees leaped out of the moist earth, some of them oak, others evergreen and birch, each one with its leaves swaying in the rain-sweetened breeze.  He heard the melodies of birds on the wind, and saw animals whose names he knew not galloping and frolicking about the landscape.                “What heaven!”  he shouted.     III                 For many hours he watched as this cacophony surrounded him, as life spread from barren rock.  He strode among his creations, patted the heads of the creatures that would approach him, whistled along with the songs of birds in the canopy of trees above him.  Heorogar was in a forest.  He had almost forgotten what a forest was.  He walked for many miles, through the groves of fruit, the rain occasionally falling through the roof of leaves above his head.  He would test the power of his fingertips by pressing them to whatever he could find.  By careful guidance he found he could nurture a branch from a tree, could raise it from the trunk as long as he kept his fingers on its surface.  Years of this flew by, and Heorogar all but forgot the savage hell he had eradicated.  Through subtle manipulation he found that he could even create human life, and he did so in secret from the beings that sprouted from the earth around him, so that they would not, by chance, try to destroy him or attack him.                All he could do was revel in his power.              With the pendant around his neck his consciousness gradually grew, and he could feel the whisperings of the world, and would speak gently in reply to them, as a father would to his child.  He heard of evil lurking in the empty abyss of night, loping over the deserts his powers had missed, and hiding in the caverns of mountains, all of them waiting for a time ripe enough to strike.  He could see their eyes from great distances, and he would glare at their ferocity with unequalled anger and hatred.  They would cower and retreat into the murk, as was their way.  Their horde would mass again, but not in Heorogar’s time.              Throughout the course of his long life he would see the flapping wings in the sky, and hear the scream of the rider’s horn tremble the earth at his feet.  But it never approached him.  Somehow it was responsible for all of this, whatever it was.  Heorogar felt it in is heart, that it had caused the great purge of life, and then had given him the ability to bring the world back into its glory.  You may have been the one who even brought me back from Gadden, he thought as he watched it frolic over the horizon.              For all the pendant’s wonderful sky-fallen sorcery, Heorogar realized within a decade that it did not halt or slow the aging process.  His hair became gray and his bones brittled, and while civilization thrived across the world, over the course of many years Heorogar became feeble.  He wandered among the cities that they had created, watched their magnificent battles from far away, all the while wrapped in a tattered cloak that kept his face concealed within its shadow.  He heard of Gadden’s rise, but knew that for whatever reason he lived in a time long before his birth.  It was of little consequence.              On the last day of his life, Heorogar found himself atop a verdant hill, his eyes wandering among the ranks of two gigantic armies that had amassed there before morning.  Horses pulling grand chariots trotted back and forth, and the leaders of both sides shouted uplifting speeches to their men.  Arrows began to pierce the clouds and hail onto the enemy ranks, and the two sides charged at each other, each screaming taunts and profanities at the other in their own alien tongues.  Wonderful, the creator thought to himself, as the ranks met and carnage ensued, even in death my creations are wonderful.  From this hail a stray arrow streaked and sailed, its shaft abruptly piercing Heorogar’s neck.  He coughed blood and dropped to the field, his tight fingers clutching the bloodied shaft.  With no reluctance he released his grip, and in peace, let go.              The two armies met, their ranks tangling together in a disorganized mass of gluttony, the clangs of metal upon metal ringing far and wide over the verdant lands.  Catapults whipped boulders into the air, and they splashed upon the grass, tumbling about wildly into the onslaught.  Horns trumpeted through the screams, the commanders of both sides trying in vain to direct their soldiers, and terror leeched itself onto the courage of the clashing armies.  As time rolled by the green earth reddened, slowly but eerily, and the dead soldiers lay upon the ground, their blood quietly draining away before their eyes.              In the midst of the battle, a bearded warrior in the Trachan army named Garamund looked away from the screams and the fray, his axe embedded within the ribcage of an unworthy foe, and on the top of a low hill he saw a lone, cloaked figure fall from a stray arrow.  A strange curiosity overtook the barbarian, and for a moment, he thought he saw a glimmer of light where the arrow had struck.  Loot.  Bullion, he thought as he wrenched the bloodied weapon from the corpse at his feet.  Over the course of the next half hour he made his way through the perilous battle to the periphery, his legs carrying him off toward the hill, where he found the corpse alone atop the grass.              Garamund pushed the hood away from the man’s face, ignoring the great age expressed in the wrinkles that lined his face.  Upon his bloodied neck, strangely devoid of the old man’s bodily fluids, an upside-down cross hung loosely.  Garamund pulled it away and slipped it over his own neck.  In the sky a screech echoed, and Garamund quickly glanced upward, to see the two flapping wings of a strange beast among the distant clouds.  The pendant in his hand glimmered brightly, and without checking the rest of the body for objects to procure he hastily departed, returning to the waning battleground, axe in hand.  Many hours passed and the Trachans fled the battlefield, Garamund reluctantly among them.  Over the course of the next several months, through several brutal campaigns, the Trachans were defeated.  Through various bribery their lands were spared, however great tributes had to be paid before the warriors were allowed to return to their lands.  Garamund survived, and with the pendant procured unknowingly from his creator, he fled at full speed to his native home of Ivluv, trying to ignore the memory of the thing in the sky that had screamed at him as he took the pendant away.                He felt the future beckon.

      The following is a somewhat-edited-but-not-quite-finished story that I wrote today.  2,000 words long, I plan to send it off as soon as possible.  NUMINA             Hear me!  Since I now face my end I have decided to take down the account of the events that transpired over the course of the last few weeks.  I have exhausted all monetary funds and the source of drugs I inject into my arm will soon run dry, leaving my mind nothing more than a dried cinder of what it once was.  I don’t know if anyone will ever find this, however I have no doubt that I will find some solace in even the minute possibility of this story being discovered.  Peace before my death is welcomed.             Being within the throngs of the upper class, I found myself making enemies left and right with actions I must admit were less than benevolent.  I fired many more workers than required, solicited shady business deals with the mafia, several of which went awry, and purchased the support of many senators and world leaders.  I grew fabulously rich at the head of my corporation, an aircraft manufacturer, and delighted in the fats and profits that I could suckle from the wars and skirmishes brought on by the current conservative administration.  I don’t know who it was, the traitor within my own ranks who did me in, but—in any case, one night I was knocked unconscious in my bed by a shadow I noticed all but too late.  I awoke an indiscernible time later, my mouth gagged, my feet and hands tightly bound, my eyes useless, for the room was blacker than oil.  I could feel the thrum of an engine under the cool, metal floor I was tossed like a doll upon, and suddenly I heard the groans and whines of mechanical cogs below.  My eyes widened in the darkness, and the floor fell away, the abrupt light all but blinding me.             I was in freefall; many thousands of feet above what my eyes told me was a desert.  The sky was a sickly orange and the few clouds that hovered silently sported black undersides.  I looked up; to see the small pinpoint I had fallen from circling in the air, an airplane, no doubt of my own design and of my own manufacture.  The wind grew unbearable and the dunes rushed up to meet me.  I didn’t have the time to feel terror.             To my surprise I awoke, remembering the fall immediately.  I didn’t bother to wonder how I had survived, and with no immediate injuries, at that.  I was still bound and gagged, but I quickly used some of the techniques I had procured from my shady business partners, loosening the ropes in no time at all.  I stood, found myself on the desert, the crater from my fall disintegrating before me as the arid wind forced pockets of sand back into the hole I had created.  I quickly noticed my hard, cracked tongue—dried now for a long time.  I felt then an amazing desire for water, but knew that I could find none.             I didn’t have the faintest idea as to my location, deciding just to head in one direction and hope that it would lead me somewhere, an oasis, a city, a town—before the desert claimed my body.  For many days and nights I crossed the tall crests of dunes, the sun peeling away my skin.  I could only hear the faint sound of sand sliding down the desert carpet, like it was some kind of ethereal snake.  My mind was running away, gliding away—and in my desperation I began to sing my favorite rock songs from the sixties, my eyes all but blinded from the never-ending furnace above.  Eventually the air became even staler, and the hot desert breeze that had once blown loud enough to rival the jet engines of my airplanes was now no more than a mere whisper.             The dunes flattened out, and I discerned that this was the place that I would die—in a sandblasted basin that stretched on forever into the horizon.  Night fell on what I believed to be my last day on earth, for now I could hardly manage even a crawl.  The sweat had long ago dried up from my armpits, from my forehead, and there remained not a cell of my skin not ravaged by the burning sun.  There was a full moon, the first I had seen in a great while, and as I gazed at its beauty my legs found a weak spot in the desert carpet, and I fell through, my throat too dry to scream, and long exhausted from singing the songs from the sixties.               I plummeted for only a few seconds and soon found myself surrounded by water, and had to fight to stay afloat while I drank from the pool I had fallen in, the moon’s light falling through the skylight I had created.  After a long while I was contented, and with new strength swam until I found the pool’s edge.  I seemed to be in some kind of subterranean cave, a place long ago hallowed by ancient waters that had settled here or gone elsewhere.  Curtains of light danced on the walls from the water, which seemed to have a kind of spiritual glow that is hard to explain.  I walked for a long while in the gloom, noticing odd inscriptions on the walls in texts that I had never seen before, in all my years.  Eventually it became so dark that I had to feel my way through the cave, and as time wore on it became smaller, barely large enough for me to walk through (and my stature is fairly short).  My hands continued to see in the stead of my eyes, sliding along the ruffles of rock and sand on either side of me, until they met at a door.             The surface before me was hard, cold, and flat, shaped like a rectangle.  I found a groove for a hand and pulled.  The door opened, quite silently and unexpectedly easily, and before me, in an amphitheater below an opening to the moonlit sky, stood a dark monolith.  I approached it, feeling greatly uneasy.  I crept up to it, dared to touch it with my hand.  It was warm.  My hand darted back.  It seemed, then, that the light in the room grew, in a subtle fashion, mind you, but yes, the light in the room grew enough so that my eyes could pick out the details on the tall obelisk before me.             Hideous bas-relief met my eyes—giant, bipedal monsters danced about on the stone surface as others were skewered by spears or sabers.  Flying beasts with cylindrical jaws wheeled about in the sky in dizzying flocks, swarming about their prey and picking it clean.  I don’t know how I could see all of this through the stone, but it was there, a vision playing itself through my mind.  Their statures were stunted even though they walked on two legs; their mouths seemed to be roaring in sync with each other, each baring great sets of glassy, carved teeth that beckoned the taste of flesh.  This carved stone, whatever it was, held some kind of great significance, and I felt that the creatures must have gathered here, in some antediluvian time, to dance about its circumference in a wild orgy of death and mayhem, cackling and reveling as they maimed each other for whatever god or slew of gods this thing was meant to represent.    My knowledge pertaining to the field of archaeology was somewhat limited, but as I studied the monolith I became convinced that it could not have been fashioned by human hands.  The creatures depicted before me were completely alien to the world in its current age—all of them, and I knew that even the most ancient stone structures or cave paintings mentioned a human here or a familiar creature there.  And yet there was none of this.  What I was looking at was a relic from some long forgotten civilization, one that must have died out long before the age of humanity.  With renewed curiosity I touched the slab, with my right hand, then with both hands, rubbing my tortured skin over its surface, feeling the grooves worked by horrific, clawed appendages.  And then it came, from some unforeseeable depth, from out of an orifice I had not originally espied.  A cloud of dizzying black drained itself from the hole and shaped itself into a fiend I shall never forget, its deep, maniacal voice akin to the sound of raking claws and the guttural moaning of lions before the kill.  I could hear it calling to me, the sound even penetrating my mind, trying to force me to remain in my current position, so it could catch me and drag me into whatever underworld collective it had detached itself from.  I backed away, the unearthly fear so great in me that I would have fainted had some degree of perseverance remained in my mind.  I fell back behind the doorway and slammed it shut, searching with my hands in the dark for a locking mechanism of any kind, but finding none.  It shouted my name, as a mother would to a disobedient child.  The door’s mouth widened, and I hurled myself against it, screaming such screams as men never scream.  It hurled its hellish form against the door, knocking me away into the hallway.  I lay there, dazed and hopeless, and its pitch colored body, which had now manifested itself as a solid form, began to encroach upon my position, its many appendages opened wide, beckoning angrily for my body, for my soul, and for whatever else remained.  Such fear throbbed through my body then, such a paralyzing feeling, enough to nearly detach me from consciousness, but I fought it, I fought the fear and I remained awake, the thing still approaching and nearly on top of me.  I felt its touch, felt its sick, amphibious skin pressed against mine.  I think it was then that I lost my mind, that whoever I once was found himself smothered by extraordinary circumstance.  I backed away, still on my back, my screams now coming in harsh rasps.  Its tentacle darted out and I kicked it away, the claw on the end of it slicing the skin of my leg.  I stood, my blood draining away to the floor of the cave, and fled to the distant, almost otherworldly gurgling sound of the water.  It roared, and I smelt its breath, a vaporous aroma of decaying, rotting fish.  I fell into the water, swam away, hoping to find some way to the surface.  I saw the hole in the ceiling I created; saw the moon above, and then looked back to the cave.  The thing was slithering into the water, and when its skin touched the surface an inky stain began to spread about and uncoil, swirling about like the storms of Jupiter.    How or if I escaped to this day I fear I shall never know, and it was weeks later that I was found by a desert caravan.  They tell me now that I was ranting both ranting in tongues and singing songs from the sixties, that I screamed strange words at them and made gestures that they could not interpret.  When I awoke from the sickly dream in the city of Cairo I managed to regain some of my original self.  I told them my name but they didn’t believe me, and I looked at a picture of myself and found that even after shaving my scraggly beard and hair that I looked nothing like who I was.  Without enough money to travel back to the states I remained in the humble homestead that had rescued me, purchasing drugs to keep awake for extended periods of time so as not to dream of the terrors of the desert.  But now I have run out of the drugs, and the family has left me on the street, and every night when the moon rises I see the thing’s shadow basking in its light, I see it glaring at me with lidless eyes, and I feel the touch of its skin.  I am glad, for one, that I will not live to see its armies overrun war-exhausted mankind, that I shall not see the world devoured by a merciless desert, that I shall not see the billions and billions of human beings reduced to slaves or ornaments or food for hungry, antediluvian monsters.    My time is over.  The thing approaches.  I will hide; it won’t get me—not again.  The hand!  The tentacle!  The street!  Oh, get away you fool--

      I've started reading Anna Karenina, I'm about fifty pages deep.  And I'm enthralled.  I've decided that at least tentatively, I want Intertwine (my grand masterpiece) to be something even a tenth as incredible.  The characters and the psychology of this book are unlike anything that I've ever read before.  My eyes will likely be occupied with text translated from Russian for some time.  So, I scrapped the last draft of Intertwine.  I wrote up a new plot, that will hopefully appeal to more distinguished readers.  In any case I started a new draft (the fourth or fifth, over the course of at least a year, probably two).  The draft follows, mostly unedited--  Reflected on the windows of a zeppelin cabin, the city of Nelence looked beautiful.  Majestic skyscrapers climbed the sky, their minarets skewering the clouds.  The metals that had been forged together by a combination of great wealth and great skill gleamed in the morning sunlight, as if they were made of silver, or as if they were competing with the sun in the sky to be the brightest.  Throngs of automobiles sped through the city streets, accompanied by bowler hat toting businessmen, all of them wearing suitably dark clothing, as was the fashion of the age.  The city brimmed with life and with activity, and to look upon it at such an early hour would easily quell even the greatest fatigue.  Coffee shops were rare in Nelence.  The miasma of life and excitement could not be ignored by even the laziest of travelers.    The sky was packed with zeppelins, many of them large enough to blot the sun out for the entire length of a city street.  Inside the cabin of one of the bigger zeppelins, a transport being readied to travel to the distant isle of Vadaina, sat a lone noble from a distant, quieter region, where the only noises came from frogs and from dragonflies.  This had been his first trip in awhile to Nelence, for he hated the city with a passion and avoided it whenever he could, in spite of his title as Lord of Bethnen, a province to the far, tenebrous south.  He was an irritably shy young man who had assumed the helm of his lordship only months ago, alienating his now deceased father’s officers and diplomats and officials, who had been used to a jollier noble, who could wring a smile out of anyone by merely looking at them.  His father was a great man, and Élan D’Bethne lived far within the confines of his shadow, even in death.  He had left most of the work up to the officials, preferring to instead stay within his quarters and stare at his desk, or the latest dispatches, tax reports, various municipal problems.  It bored him to the brink of insanity, and yet there was no alternative.  Somehow, his father, whom Élan had felt his entire life was a rather clumsy and stupid fellow, had managed to command all of these ostentatiously complicated tasks, all the while with a gleam in his eye and a wide, pleasant smile on his handsome face.  He had succumbed quite unexpectedly to the Halberd Fever, an incurable disease, and died less than a week later.  Élan had searched frantically for another heir, perhaps a distant relation, but there was none.    And then, only a few weeks after taking over as head of Bethnen, Élan had been instructed by a high-ranking official calling himself Ignav in Nelence to meet up with his old friend, Salax D’Vadai, a prince of the Isle of Vadaina, a beautiful paradise, of thick jungles and wet draperies of leaves and foliage.  Élan went to Vadaina whenever he had the time to.  In spite of its large capital, Tune (Élan hated large cities.  Or cities at all) it was quiet and lovely.  There was always a pretty girl to flirt with and grin at, always a bathwater ocean to dive into.  The instructions told him to meet up with Salax and then bring him to Nelence, where the tri-annual Council of Nobles would convene to discuss matters pertaining to governing the vast Isardan Empire.    The cabin he sat within was quite opulent and, for the moment, quite quiet, since Élan had arrived early enough to beat the traffic and the crowds.  In fact, Élan noticed that he was the sole occupier of it.  Its walls were lit with the warm, orange glow of oil lamps, and lavish, comfortable couches were scattered about its floor.  None of this really concerned Élan, however—he had seen it all before.  His whole life he had been surrounded by luxury and riches.  As such, flying first class on a zeppelin was not unusual at all.    He had brought a book along for the journey but didn’t feel like reading it.  He didn’t feel like doing much of anything.  Élan D’Bethne was depressed beyond what his outward looks could convey.  Before him he saw year after year of boredom and misery and municipality.  His hairs would gray over, his skin would shrivel and he would die in his bed…somehow he knew it.  Since his childhood he had always craved the life of an adventurer, and the death of one too—and yet, in these times adventures were hard to come by.  With these inward thoughts he slumped in his chair.  At the far end of the cabin the wooden door was quietly opened to allow a rather obese man inside, his suit clinging to his fat and sweating body.  His head was bald and gleamed under the oil lamps, and his face seemed to be wrinkled in a perpetual smile, one so wide as to reduce his eyes to mere slits.  He trotted over to the seat directly across from Élan and maneuvered himself into it, the chandeliers shaking as his rump hit the cushion.  He was holding a newspaper, but quickly tossed it to the ornate table at his side.  “Beautiful day,” he declared, to Élan, who had already noticed.  “Yes, quite nice.”  “Yes,” Élan replied, quickly attempting to derail any attempt at conversation, his eyes drifting to the window.  “My name’s Edgar,” said the man, pitching his blubbery body forward and extending his hand, “Edgar Semmel.”  “How extraordinary,” murmured Élan, who briefly shook Edgar’s hand.  Edgar noticed the sarcasm and the venom in Élan’s voice, but pretended not to.  Still leaning forward, and with a shine in his eye, he asked “And what might your name be?”  “Élan D’Bethne.”  “Ah!  Sounds like a northerly name!  D’ya hail from the Scend territories?  I hear winters up there are pretty rough.”  Élan shut his eyes with frustration, then opened them again.  “No, actually I’m from the south.  From Bethnen.”  Edgar seemed unhindered in his attempts to elucidate conversation.  “Oh, sorry my mistake, I should have recognized the accent.  Do they make good Rennel in Bethnen?  I’m quite fond of Rennel.  Have you ever tried it?”  Before Élan could answer, Edgar shrieked “waiter!”  At once, a thin, tall man in black tails arrived.  He hovered quietly over Edgar, visibly hoping to get the business over with.  “Yes, sir?”  he murmured.  “Bring us two dozen Remmel.  And—and be quick about it.”  The waiter nodded and then hurried away.  As if to convey a secret, Edgar leaned forward once more, nearly taking his chair with him.  “I take this flight every week, and I’ve never been too fond of that man.  All he says is yes sir, and he never stops looking so annoyed.  Haven’t you noticed that too, Mr. D’Bethne?”  Élan nodded.  Slowly.  “Oh, good, I thought I was going crazy.  This job of mine, you know, working in the King’s Foreign Ministry, it’s a nightmare!  He always wants me to be so aggressive with everyone I meet, but it just isn’t in my nature.  I’m terrified of getting fired, because it’s quite a good income, and for doing next to nothing!  Except for threatening foreigners of course, but don’t we all do that at some point or another in our lives?  Isn’t it just in our nature?  Hmm, well anyway…”  And for the next ten minutes Edgar droned on about his work, mentioning a phrase that involved the word nature every few sentences.  Élan nodded every now and then, sometimes made grunting noises with his neck, and found himself fighting to stay sane.  Here was a fat man, who had come out of nowhere to talk to Élan about his job.  And for what?  He didn’t know Élan.  And then the Remmel arrived.     The funny thing is, I came up with the name Elan god knows how long ago, since the very first draft that character has been around (even though he has shifted from comedic relief to something a bit deeper...I hope).  However this year a freshman came to my high school with the same name.  He seems like a cool guy, I spoke to him once for a second, but I'm worried that if I ever get the book published and keep the name that people will think I'm some kind of stalker and named the fellow after him.  Hmm...

       The sun fell below the shoulders of the horizon, and the city of Nelence emerged in glorious twilight, her lights and windows sparkling in magnificent necklaces draped luxuriously over her buildings and towers and skyscrapers.  Far above the tallest buildings stood a Cyclopean relic, a pristine cylinder of architectural brilliance that had stood at a height of over a hundred and fifty stories since the birth of Isardis.  It was Isardis—in all of its immortal grandeur, among the clouds, higher than heaven.  At its highest floor, peering—no—gazing through a window onto the city below, stood the King Alexius IV.  He was a tall man, and although his body was very old it still seemed to echo a strength not found often.  Here was a warrior, an Ariladat, the greatest of fighters, the strongest, and the bravest of creatures, who had proven himself above all others to the previous King, and was thus nominated as his successor.  Alexius’ face, reflected in the warm candlelight emanating from a chandelier, conveyed this character almost as much as his actions would.  It was lean and straight, the nose was thin and the eyes large and round, the pupils never dilated behind green irises.  He heard the door behind him click open, recognized the hesitant step of his son.  His left hand tightened over a golden staff, the ornament passed on from King to King, since the foundation of Isardis.  Alexius hated his son.  He turned, his eyes met his son’s face—and he saw himself in the man before him, the despicable man before him, the man that would plunder the throne if left to rule.  Little bits and pieces of his long-deceased mother had melted together with his own in the man’s face, most specifically his nose, which was flat and round, almost like a pig’s, ruining the handsomeness of our genetics, thought the King.  Alexius had always hated the nose.  He had wanted his son to look exactly like himself; he had wanted a clone, not an offspring, but a duplicate that would go beyond his wildest expectations.  Since the boy’s birth he had been disappointed, always disappointed.  An abysmal failure on his own part, for even wanting a son.  He wasn’t a boy anymore, though—that much was sure.  He was old now, his long hair had started to gray, wrinkles had begun to grin under his eyes and around his mouth.  Every day he looked more and more like Alexius, and every day he acted less and less like him.  The woman he had finally found to marry, a princess from the province of Davan, was a whore—nothing more than a filthy whore from a poor, filthy province, birthed from the lips of a whore mother, conceived by a bastard father.  It showed in her face, in her consistent disrespect toward Alexius, in her defiance—she was a harlot, and although he hated his son, and had secretly loathed him for as long as he had existed, he knew that if there was any hope of saving Isardis that the next heir down the line, his grandson, would have to be strong.  He needed a strong mother, a cunning mother, a beautiful mother.  Not unlike that girl he had met yesterday at the council…what was her name…Hara.  Such a pity, thought Alexius, Hara will never see her husband again.  Alexius realized that he had been glaring silently at his son this whole time, his fingers white over the ornate orb at the end of his staff.    “I’ve had enough of this, father.  Cassandra is in hysterics after what you pulled tonight.  You two hate each other.  You hate my wife.  You hate your own daughter.”   Alexius felt his hatred churn about, and he had great difficulty restraining himself.  Sweat began to perspire on his hands, and a bead of moisture ran down the golden surface of the staff.  “I’ll disown you if you call her my daughter ever again, Alex.  She is the daughter of a harem.  If you have anything sensible to say you’d better say it now before I call the guards.”  “Guards?   Guards?   You dare to call the guards on  me ?  You’re delusional, father, you’ve really lost it this time—”  “Enough!  I have decided.  If you marry her you will not inherit the throne.”  Alex tried to speak, but his father’s intensified glare silenced him.  “Get that… bitch  on a train back to Davan.  I don’t want to ever see you two together again.”  Alex closed his eyes tightly with his father’s words, then opened them with a renewed passion, and stepped forward, his boots clicking on the marble floor.  He came face-to-face with his father, their noses nearly touching, each with his face soaked in sweat.  “Don’t…” and he paused, realizing the gravity of his defiance, “call her that.”  Alexius felt the anger boil over, felt it thrum through his broadening veins.  He gritted his teeth together, lifted the golden staff into the air, and heard its otherworldly swoop as his arms brought it down over Alex’s head, smashing the skull, soaking the round orb at the end in blood.  Alex didn’t crumple, but fell, as a tree does when it is cut down, his boots clattering on the marble.  Alexius dropped the staff, and felt a lurch in his stomach.     What have I done?     The King fell forward, on his knees, lifted the bleeding head in his hands, the fluids dripping onto his extravagant satin robes.  He could see the folds of the brain through the gaping breach in the skull, could see then that there was no hope.  He dropped Alex to the floor and backed away on all fours to the window, squeezed himself into the fetal position and began to shake, his breath coming in wheezes and gasps.     What have I done?   It felt like a waterfall, like the deafening roar of a waterfall, the memories of his son flooding his mind, thrashing about.  I loved my son.  He saw Alex’s birth, his little face in his arms, his screaming mouth, how he was covered in disgusting liquid…but then noticed how he calmed as he felt the heartbeat of his father, felt his chest expanding with his breath.  He saw Alex playing on a beach, the wind was strong, he heard his laugh, the laugh of a happy child, and saw a red kite intense against a blue, cloudless sky.  He saw Alex playing in the bathtub with his mother, splashing her with bubbles, screaming with glee.  It was all there, the love that he had never admitted to feel, the flood of it drenching his mind.   What have I done?   The guards charged into the room, swords and pistols drawn, only seconds after the event had taken place.  They shouted “Where is the killer,” to the King, but the King didn’t reply, said nothing, as the Royal Doctor arrived from the party several floors down, not even bothering to take out his tools, seeing, as the King did, as the murderer did, that there was no hope for the body of the King’s only heir, which now lay in a dark, crimson pool of its own blood.   Murderer.    What have I done?   The King lay there, curled at the window, as the early morning arrived.  Guards had been posted nearby, and his officials had been shouting at him for hours, begging to get a word out of him, but finding it impossible.  The body was taken away by a coroner, the blood cleaned by a tear-eyed maiden from the polished marble floor.  He overheard the guards talking about how the princess had been informed, how she had cried and then left without a word to anyone.  It was all Alexius’ fault, everything was his fault.  I am a murderer.  He clenched his fists at the thought, his breath coming in haggard wheezes.  The guards heard, and they rushed to his aide, picking him up and carrying him through the hallways that the King saw in only a blur, his eyes wandering the painted portraits of past rulers and generals and great men, each with his own frame of opulent gold.  He was dumped into his bed, and the guards began to shout for help.  He heard the thumping of more feet on the floor, noticed he couldn’t move his body, his vision narrowing to a pinpoint of light.  The noise around him blurred and thickened, and he blacked out.

      I haven't updated in awhile.    Who cares?  Well to those brave enough to read, I have decided to post the entire manuscript for my "big" project.    Skip ahead if you like, but I'd like to revel in memory, as fifteen year-olds so often do.  Because we have so many memories to draw upon, you see.  Intertwine was born at least two years ago.  Exactly when I could figure out if I was exuberant enough but for now I think I'll just say..about two years ago.  I had been writing since I was nine, off and on an old Windows 3.1 computer.  Some of my older stuff is still on that thing, even though it's sitting in the gloom of my basement.  I guess my earlier stories were mostly Star Trek and Matrix ripoffs, some of them reached lengths of up to a hundred pages, maybe twice that much in isolated cases.  Although I doubt I shall ever be able to prove (or capitalize upon) it, I wrote a scene somewhat similar to the car chase in Attack of the Clones.  As time progressed, I found myself in High School, and I was writing Star Wars fiction, a big, alternative universe story, so I could create my own picture, and kill Darth Vader off with a sexy evil babe.  Needless to say this story got very long, however it was just Star Wars.  Not original enough.    I abandoned the story, maybe if I become succesful I'll buy up the movie rights and remake the prequels.  But for now there will not be any more Star Wars.  I began to think of something new, something fantastic, something medieval.  I thought up a name, deciding that, like most (if not, all) epics, mine would deal with the constant interplay between good and evil, and the shades of gray in between, above all.  I thought up an image of a rope, how the coils seem to wrap around each other.  They are intertwined together, just as good an evil always are.  Thus, Intertwine was born.  I would capitalize upon man's natural fear of lizards (which is actually due to racial memory, arboreal primates survived by being naturally afraid of snakes, etcetera) by making man-lizards.  And there would be two planets...one connected to the other via tower, one good and earthlike, one sickly and venusian.  There would be an immortal king, who was evil, a ruthless, calculating bastard.  There were many, many other elements, and gradually as I wrote hundreds and hundreds of pages of drafts the story evolved.  The strongest plot devices I had thought up I kept (they survived)--the ones previously mentioned--while I also created new ones.  The story would not be medieval.  It would take place in a timeperiod similar to pre WW1 Europe, in a time where the old world of knights and dragons was dying and the new world of science and guns and planes was being born.  Midway through the story a planet would appear in the sky and approach Terra (Earth), grow to the size of the moon, grow larger and larger, and a tower would connect and horrific beasts would ravage the land.  The one new theme I decided to go along with was that the only perfection that can be reached is nonexistence.  I came to the conclusion several months ago (maybe longer, I don't know) that heaven, no matter how infinite, would eventually get boring to H. Sapiens.  We would go insane in paradise, while if we were simply to fade away after death, we would truly be perfect.  Neither happy nor said.  If you think about it enough, nonexistence becomes preferrable to afterlife, unless by some chance humans just simply cannot grasp what the afterlife is.  I could be wrong or I could be right.  I doubt that this is my original thought, someone else must have thought of it somewhere, however I believe for now that I thought it up on my own.  So the main character would strive toward perfection.  Then, at the end, when he confronts the greatest evil, the lizard-god, and with the hopes of all humanity on him, he would be offered the chance to destroy evil and liberate humanity from the lizards, or to just kill everyone by plunging the two planets into each other.  After deliberation he chooses the latter, for there is no absolute good, and suffering can only be extinguished by having everyone just die.  That before Sauria there was always suffering, and that even a little was too much.  I'm not a firm believer of that philosophy.  I enjoy life, live it to the fullest, walk old ladies across the street, etc.    In any case I guess that's it for my little introduction.  If you've read this far then I certainly admire your tenacity.  Read on and enjoy.  Perfection awaits.       INTERTWINE BY IAN ******* I To not be is perfection.  Morning in Nelence was a sight to behold, and a sight beheld by many.  It was the capital of the thriving Isardan Empire, after all.  Pillars of gleaming steel climbed from foundations of marble and stone into a sky filled with thick, golden clouds, the sun illuminating them with heavenly glory.  Below, the streets were bustling with motorcars and dark-suited pedestrians, and the sidewalks seemed overrun with the bobbing heads and shoulders of bowler-hat toting businessmen, each cranium in sync with the last, like the running waves of an ocean.  Lights from the insides of buildings began to flicker to life as the streetlamps along the crowded corridors below simultaneously deactivated.  Shadows once invisible were stretched across the pavement.  It was a symphony of activity, and all of it orchestrated to perfection unknowingly by the denizens of it.  The once-silent canyons of the city were now alive with sound and what can only be described as emotion, as feeling, as atmosphere, in a chorus that thickened but did not grow, that became only more noticeable, but not so loud as to annoy.  These patterns of Nelence, oddly enough, only seemed to be noticed by outsiders, and those that had not spent an extended amount of time within the canyons of its glimmering metal.  The sky was packed with zeppelins and other flying vehicles, many of them large enough to blot the sun out for whole city streets. Inside the warm, opulent cabin of one of the bigger blimps, a transport being readied to travel to the faraway island province of Vadaina, sat a lone governor from a distant, quieter region, where the only noises came from frogs and from dragonflies.   This had been his first trip in years to Nelence, for he hated the capital with a passion and avoided it whenever he could.  Too many damn people in too small a space lived here.  He had been summoned by an official at the Congress Building (just out of site of his window) and ordered to meet up with his friend on the Island of Vadaina before returning to convene in a conference of aristocrats.  The meeting was apparently of some special importance; at least, according to the letter he had received.  So he had left the gloom of Bethnen, the province he was sovereign over, against his will, as many things were these days, traveling by train, by car, and by blimp over the course of several weeks, through the various assorted territories of the Isardan Empire, meeting new people and attempting to avoid them at the same time.    He was an irritably shy young man who had assumed the helm of his lordship only months ago, alienating his now deceased father’s officers and diplomats and officials, who had been used to a jollier leader, his predecessor, his parent, who could wring a smile out of anyone by merely looking at them. His father was a great man, and Élan D’Bethne lived far within the confines of his shadow, even in death.  Élan was tall and very thin, his dark hair clung precariously to his high forehead, and his eyes seemed to suggest only laziness, only calm and peace, while the reality behind them, within the folded layers of flesh he called his brain, was greatly different.  He blushed often, and realized it.  His lips were thin and wide, and the overall feeling one could garner from the young man was that he was indeed of noble birth, he was of high standing and intelligence, but lacked perseverance, lacked inspiration to make anything out of himself.  He was just another face in the crowd.  He had left most of the work up to the officials, preferring to instead stay within his quarters and stare at his desk, or the latest dispatches, tax reports, various municipal problems. It bored him to the brink of insanity, and yet there was no alternative. No escape.  He clenched his fist at the thought, breathing quickened.  Heat came to the cheeks.  Somehow, his father, whom Élan had felt his entire life was a rather clumsy and stupid fellow, had managed to command a plethora of these ostentatiously complicated tasks, all the while with a gleam in his eye and a wide, pleasant smile on his handsome face. Élan had never loved his father, had instead felt a kind of attachment to him, a responsibility.  The Old Lord had succumbed quite unexpectedly to the Halberd Fever, an incurable disease, and died less than a week later. Élan had searched frantically for another heir, perhaps a distant relation, but there was none willing to take the Bethnen Throne.   And then, only a few months after taking over as Lord, Élan had been instructed by a high-ranking official calling himself Ignav to meet up with his old friend, Salax D’Vadai, a prince of the Isle of Vadaina, a beautiful jungle paradise, packed with wet draperies of lush leaves and foliage. Élan fled to Vadaina whenever he had the time to, finding that there was always a pretty girl to flirt with and grin at, always a bathwater ocean to dive into.   The instructions told him to meet up with Salax and then bring him to Nelence, where the tri-annual Council of Nobles would convene to discuss matters pertaining to governing the vast Isardan Empire.  They seemed to have been scrawled haphazardly by an already-strained hand.  The writer had signed “Ignav: Regent under the Emperor his Majesty Alexis IV.”  Élan hadn’t bothered to check the authenticity of the note (it seemed quite ostentatious enough), preferring instead to depart from the troubles and worries of his fiefdom.  Maybe he wouldn’t go back…  The cabin he sat within was quite opulent and, for the moment, quite silent, the only noise a barely-noticeable susurrus  emanating from the craft’s distant and powered-down engines.  Élan had arrived early enough to beat the traffic and the crowds. In fact, Élan noticed that he was the sole occupant. Its walls were lit with the warm, orange glow of oil lamps, and lavish, comfortable couches were scattered about its floor. None of this really concerned Élan, however—he had seen it all before. His whole life he had been surrounded by luxury and riches. As such, flying first class on a zeppelin was not unusual at all.   He had brought a book along for the journey but didn’t feel like reading it. He had a package of dried fruit in his pocket, and although he had a special fondness for dried fruit, he didn’t feel like eating it.  He didn’t feel like doing much of anything, for, Élan D’Bethne was depressed beyond what his outward, lackadaisical looks could convey. Before him he saw year after year of boredom and misery and municipality. Governing a gloomy, backwater province with the smallest population in the Empire (but the third-largest land mass) was a task anyone could perform—all it required was a hand fast enough to sign new tax proposals—but because the land he had been born as a noble in was governed by a feudal aristocracy he had been left no choice.  If he fled, he would be found, tortured by a filthy band of hired mercenaries, and executed.  If he stayed, his hairs would gray over, his skin would shrivel and he would die in his bed…somehow he knew it.  His clenched fist loosened, even though the palm was now sweaty.   Since his childhood he had always craved the life of an adventurer, and the death of one too—and yet, in these times adventures were hard to come by. There were no more knights, no more horses, no more round tables—just artillery shells and trenches, where children (who were barely adults), with minds full of propaganda fed to them by the Emperor his majesty Alexius IV, would die.  By the hot bullets fired from rifles, by the acrid gas fissured from all around, by the shells blasted from tanks or artillery, they would almost certainly perish.  War was no longer a thing of glory; instead it was a way to protect the  interests of the rich, of the aristocracy like himself.  People died for nothing.  Nothing.  With these inward thoughts he slumped further into his chair.  At the far end of the cabin the wooden door was silently opened to allow a rather obese man inside, his dark blue suit clinging to his fat and sweating body. His head was bald and gleamed under the oil lamps, and his face seemed to be wrinkled in a perpetual smile, one so wide as to reduce his eyes to mere slits. He trotted over to the seat directly across from Élan and maneuvered himself into it, the chandeliers shaking as his rump hit the cushion. He was holding a newspaper, but quickly tossed it to the ornate table at his side.  “Bea-utiful day,” he declared, to Élan, who had already noticed. “Yes, quite nice.”  “Yes, learn something new every day,” Élan replied, quickly attempting to derail any attempt at conversation, his eyes drifting to  the window.  “My name’s Edgar,” said the man, pitching his blubbery body forward and extending his hand, “Edgar Semmel.”  “How extraordinary,” murmured Élan, who briefly shook Edgar’s hand.  Edgar noticed the sarcasm and the venom in Élan’s voice, but pretended not to.  He had actually noticed it before he had said a word, it wasn’t hard to miss.  Still leaning forward, and with a shine in his eye, he asked “And what might your name be?”  “Élan D’Bethne.”  “Ah! Sounds like a northerly name! D’ya hail from the Scend territories? I hear winters up there are pretty rough.”  Élan shut his eyes with frustration, then opened them again. “No, actually I’m from the south. From Bethnen.”  Edgar seemed unhindered in his failing attempts to elucidate conversation. “Oh, sorry—my mistake, I should have recognized the accent. Do they make good Rennel in Bethnen? I’m quite fond of Rennel. Have you ever tried it?” Before Élan could answer, Edgar shrieked “waiter!”  At once, a thin, tall man in black tails arrived. He hovered quietly over Edgar, visibly hoping to leave as soon as possible. “Yes, sir?” he murmured.  “Bring us two dozen Remmel. And—and be quick about it.”  The waiter nodded and then hurried away.  As if to convey a secret, Edgar leaned forward, nearly taking his chair with him. “I take this flight every week, and I’ve never been too fond of that man. All he says is ‘yes sir,’ and he never stops looking so annoyed. Haven’t you noticed that too, Mr.  D’Bethne?”  Élan nodded. Slowly.  “Learn something new every day,” he whispered, with hints of both annoyance and hatred tinting the edges of his voice.  “Oh, good, I thought I was going crazy. This job of mine, you know, working in the King’s Foreign Ministry, it’s a nightmare! He always wants me to be so aggressive with everyone, but it just isn’t in my nature. I’m terrified of getting fired, because it’s quite a good income, and for doing next to nothing! Except for threatening foreigners of course, but don’t we all do that at some point  or another in our lives? Isn’t it just in our nature? Hmm, well anyway…”  And for the next ten minutes Edgar droned on about his work with a ferocious alacrity not often found in the average man. Élan nodded every now and then, sometimes made grunting noises with his throat.  Soon he found himself fighting to stay sane. Here was a fat man, who had come out of nowhere to talk to Élan about his job. And for what? Did he take some kind of sick pleasure in annoying people who were already visibly depressed?    And then the Rennel arrived.  The waiter hesitantly set several silvery plates before Edgar, who looked at them with an almost barbarous gleam in his squinted eyes.  The Rennel appeared to be some kind of crustacean; to Élan it looked like nothing more than a shell with globs of green mucus smeared around its skin.  Edgar waited for the servant to depart, his hands rubbing together at a rapidly accelerating rate.  Élan sighed.  The waiter departed.  And Edgar attacked the Rennel.  With the grace and velocity of a flock of birds his arms darted at the food, his fingers plucking the shells and shoveling them into his widened mouth, his throat guzzling the mucus and humming with insatiable glee.  After only a few seconds many of the plates had been picked clean, and Edgar’s face was plastered with the snot, as was his shirt, his pants, and the surrounding chair.  Élan saw the waiter enter the cabin from the far end, look at Edgar and his surroundings, and groan with a misery that would be hard to duplicate.  He could see that the waiter had been stretched to his limits, that the man hated his job only because of Edgar, his abhorrent manners and his character.  Edgar burped and then expanded his chest, reclining back into his chair and shutting his eyes with the delight of a child who had achieved his first orgasm.  “Ah…Rennel…” he murmured, more to himself than Élan (Élan hoped).  Edgar’s eyebrows then lifted, and he shouted an “oh!”  He leaned back forward and faced Élan.  “Where are my manners!  Oh, really Mr. D’Bethne you should not have let me carry on like that.”  Élan nodded, a smile touching the edges of his thin lips.  “Yes, I agree—”  “Would you like any, Mr. D’Bethne?”  Élan was immediately taken aback.  The smile faded.  “No, thank you I just had breakfast…”  “Well so have I!  Please, Mr. D’Bethne, I need to watch my weight, you know how it is, the wife is nagging me all the time about it!  Please, finish it before I do!”  Élan’s eyes widened, and he shook his head.  “No, no thank you—”  “I insist.”  “I’m quite full I assure you—”  “Please, Mr. D’Bethne.  It tastes like cinnamon!  Now who doesn’t like cinnamon?”  He sighed.  Élan’s hand plucked a shell from the cleanest tray he could find.  Edgar watched him in childlike delight, his hands almost, almost clapping together with excitement.  Élan felt like Edgar was cheering him on.  He opened his mouth and his tongue pecked at the mucus.  He paused; a look of confusion crossed his face.  His tongue took another peck, then rubbed itself around the entire shell.  His eyes widened.  He put clean shell back on the plate and then grabbed another.  “Edgar…Edgar this is good!”  “Of course it is!  Do you think I eat like this all the time?”  Not even trying to hold himself back, Élan found himself mimicking Edgar’s eating habits, and soon his entire face was smeared with the deliciously addictive Rennel.  Élan had never tasted anything like it before; it seemed to almost burn the buds off of his tongue.  Immediately after he had cleaned the remaining plates the waiter returned and picked them up, not trying to hide the disgust in his face.    “I told them to stop serving this stuff…” he murmured under his breath, but loud enough for the both of them to hear it.    “Bring us two more orders!”  shouted Élan with a grin broadening the folds of his face.   The waiter left without saying a word, and Élan looked back at Edgar, who was busy cleaning his face with a soaked napkin.  “Edgar,” said Élan, “I’m sorry—I was very impolite before, I’m not usually like this…it’s just, my life seems to have taken a turn for the worse and I wasn’t much in the mood for conversation.  You understand?” Edgar nodded.  “I had hoped to go off into the sunset or something when I got out of school, had hoped to just get away from everyone and everything…from all the diplomats and emissaries that laughed and joked with my dad and then sneered at me when he left.  They really hate me back there, back at the manor, they act almost as if it’s my fault that he died, even though it was probably one of them that drugged him with Halberd’s.”  “Who was this man, your father?” asked Edgar, his eyes on the door the waiter came through.  “Lord Gatan D’Bethne—”  “Your father was Gatan D’Bethne?  Gatan D’Bethne!”  “Yes, I’ve heard it all before, great ruler, the people loved him, should build a statue a mile high in his honor—”  “That…bastard was your father?  I spent half my career in the Foreign Assembly trying to keep him out of anything pertaining to foreign governments, he seemed to hate foreigners with a passion I’ve never, ever seen before and doubt I shall ever see again.  He always impersonated their accents, even when we were at war with them, once when we were even trying to negotiate a treaty between rival Achamaedan factions.  He was off his rocker.  Definitely off his rocker.  No sane man acted the way he did.  Tens of thousands…hundreds of thousands must have died specifically because of that man’s inherent, inexorable, insatiable stupidity.  They might not still be fighting in Achamaeda if it weren’t for him!  It took us months to get the three faction leaders together, to get them to stop killing each other, and then your father came out of nowhere and threatened the weaker one with war if he didn’t cooperate!  That fellow nearly cut your dad’s head off before he stormed out of there.  You know, I’ve been trying to fix that mess for years…”  Anger began to creep back into Élan’s mind.  The fist tightened once more.  Although he had never loved his father he had respected him and his achievements, and doubted the validity of anything that Edgar was telling him.  “Now, wait a second…”  “Oh, sure he did a damn fine job in Bethnen.  Second highest tax income to Vadaina in the whole Empire, second best economy.  They train the best soldiers there; breed the best horses in Bethnen.  And it was all because of your dad.  But I think being a general for so long may have gotten to him.”  “He told me he never lost a battle,” said Élan.  “That’s true,” murmured Edgar, his eyes wandering the pillars of gleaming metal out the window, before returning to Élan, “but did he ever tell you about the last battle he commanded, the battle that ended the last Isardan-Trachan Conflict?”  Élan shook his head.  “He told me that he retired.”  Edgar laughed.  “Who wouldn’t?  It was in Tehillo, on the border.  You know how Tehillo is; it’s nothing but a prairie.  Hot Grasslands far as the eye can see.  We must have had twenty thousand troops, both sides together.  I was there, I saw it with my own eyes, the King asked me to keep an eye on crazy D’Bethne, catch my drift?  It looked to be an easy win, probably one of the last battles of the war.  The Trachans were outnumbered three to one, and almost every last man in their army had assembled to defend against us.  We’d be able to take Tharad for real this time, annex Gol Trachos like we’ve been trying to do for the last few hundred years or so.  Your dad screwed it all up.  He charged everyone at their ranks, everyone, and the enemy general flanked him on both sides with some cavalry…and it was a mess.  It was a victory all right, but barely one at that.  Both sides lost nearly all their men.  I doubt many people have seen so many soldiers die in a single battle.  That’s why there’s been peace between us and the Trachans for so long now, because both sides are so exhausted from these never ending conflicts.  And they just keep getting worse and worse.  When the battle was over I saw your dad, didn’t dare talk to him, he had his dagger drawn like he was ready to kill someone.  Something snapped in him that day, something snapped in all of us.”  His eyes found their way back to the window.  “So many…so many soldiers, all because of an overconfident general.”  “And then he retired?”  “Who wouldn’t?”  Élan couldn’t believe this.  He was infuriated.  Both at Edgar and at his father…at his mother…at the officials that despised him, by Terra he hated them with such passion, such vehemence.  His hand went to the pistol hidden at his armpit, but he caught himself in the act and pretended that he was scratching his shoulder.  “No one ever told me.  Not even my history teachers.”  Edgar laughed snidely at the remark  “Learn something new every day.”  Over the course of the next hour several more passengers entered the cabin and took their seats.  Several appeared to be Edgar’s friends, and they joined him in making political conversation, discussing the recent events, the major advances in technology, all the while ignoring Élan, whose eyes never left the window.  The propellers first growled and then hummed as the zeppelin left its moors, and soon they were underway, the city slowly shrinking into the horizon, the glimmering Zesphyran ocean gurgling far below.  It would be a few hours yet before they reached Vadaina at top speed, and Élan’s brief happiness and excitement caused by the Rennel went into remission.  An enormous chapter of his father’s life he had never, ever known about had been unveiled by a fat, stupid man who worked in the Foreign Ministry.  And now he was stuck here surrounded by this stupid man’s stupid friends who were yelling at each other about politics…always about politics.  Everything had to be about politics.  Élan’s entire life revolved around the manipulation and subjugation of lesser peoples.  “Compromise is the art of politics!” his father had always told him, grinning as if he had made the saying up on his own.  But the true politicians always worked together to get rich or to get richer, only feigning interest in the people, only feigning differences, only feigning compromise.  Why disagree when you could pretend to disagree and garner money and power out of it?  The most successful leaders always followed the greenbacks and always used them to purchase compromise.  There were nations in Ociedies that claimed to be democratic, to have the people’s best interests at hand.  But no matter how the issue was approached, the leaders were always the same: the same upper class of aristocrats that have always ruled the world, that have always ruled mankind.  “Oh, Alexius is a fine fellow,” said a painfully thin, mustached man while taking off his top hat, “I’ve met him several times at the capital building!  You know, now that I think about it he seems to carry a kind of calm, divine presence about him.  He is certainly what a ruler is supposed to be.”  “And what is a ruler supposed to be, Jurian?” asked Edgar.  “He should be a listener,” said the skeletal Jurian, grinning like a skull with his declaration, clearly thinking it a brilliant one.  “He should be easy to talk to, and should consider every opinion, no matter how foolhardy or insignificant.”  “So should he have none of his own thoughts, or opinions?  Should he be the people’s slave, rather than their ruler and King?”  asked Edgar, as a teacher would ask a child, while Jurian did not appear to notice.  The other businessmen and politicians sitting in the vicinity listened in silence.    “Well—more or less.  I believe that he should be able to listen but also be able to decide, he should be powerful and compassionate at the same time.”  “Power and compassion are rarely associates.”  “And that’s why great rulers are just as rare!”  Edgar sighed.  “Listen to yourself.  ‘Great ruler.’  You speak of the emperor that owns you as if he is some kind of…of…I don’t know, some kind of saint.”  “To speak of anything less is blaspheme—”  “You missed my point, Jurian.  The Emperor, the President, the Ruler—these are synonyms for only one word: slavemaster.” The haggard Jurian laughed, his tone false, but only to a trained ear.  “I hear Alexius is looking for a new court jester, Edgar.  Have you thought about applying?”  Edgar ignored him, easily, because Edgar considered Jurian an intellectual inferior, a man in over his head when conversing with anything more complicated than an igneous rock.  “The King of Isardis owns everything that is Isardan, doesn’t he?  Every person, every house, every cockle of hair, every molecule of your skin is in his possession.  He owns you.  You belong to only one man, Jurian.”  Jurian remained dignified.  “That’s not true.  I could betray him if I wanted to, even though I wouldn’t, of course.  I could betray him and flee to Gol Trachos, or Achamaeda, or the New World…”  Then, with a calm look in his squinted, beady eyes, and sensing imminent victory, Edgar mused, “Even so, you’d just belong to somebody else.”  “You’re wrong, Edgar.  The King isn’t a god—he can’t see my thoughts, he can’t see my mind, my hopes, my dreams—nor can he see any of my actions.”  “The only things that would concern a wise Emperor are the actions of his populace as a whole or even the actions of a well-placed individual.  If he wanted to observe your actions, through his own eyes or through someone else’s, do you honestly think that he would have any trouble in doing so?”  “Yes, I do.”  Again, Edgar ignored him.  “You’re a slave to your ruler—whether he is elected or placed on the throne some other way, whatever he says you must do.  Facing the consequences of disobeying a command from your ruler would result in harsh punishment.  Even if what he orders you to do is illegal, you must do it, because in the end he will get you.  Indefinite imprisonment or death comes to mind, of course…”  “You’re crazy.  Besides, like I said before—Alexius is a good man.  He is not a tyrant, his reign has been both peaceful and fruitful.”  “When have you ever heard of a benevolent slavemaster, Jurian?  As for that widespread profit making, I’m sure its source is in the New World, and the labor camps Isardan corporations are building there.  The only difference between the savages there and the citizens here is that the savages know that they are enslaved.  Such a simple fact seems to escape the more…educated peoples of Ociedies.  As for the peace, you’re forgetting the last war, the one with Gol Trachos, remember?  The one that wiped out our whole army, the one that plunged us into a bottomless national debt?” Well spoken, Edgar, thought Élan, to himself, as he listened in silence, I may have misjudged you.  I hope this flight isn’t our last encounter.  Jurian didn’t reply, and was instead contented to sit back in his chair and pretend that the whole thing had never taken place.  More and more the man reminded Élan of a living, clothed skeleton, with only a thin hide of skin tightened over his bones. Edgar sighed and sat back in his seat, signaling that the conversation had concluded.  The men in the group that had sat on the couches and chairs nearby in the cabin quietly wondered what the next conversational topic would be, each trying to think of a good one to propose.    “I hear things have gotten worse in Achamaeda,” said one nearby to Élan, “it’s impossible to get in or out of that place.  Every train that runs through it is robbed, nowadays.  It’s complete anarchy, I hear.”  “Do any of you remember how Achamaeda used to be?” asked Edgar. There was a resounding chorus of no’s and shaking heads that responded.  “I guess I must be the oldest one here, then,” said Edgar, with a slight hint of despair in his voice.  “I barely remember it—I was very young, couldn’t have been more than five.  My dad was with me, it was very sunny and warm, and people there were happy.  It wasn’t the type of happiness you see with loving married couples or bright eyed children, it seemed like it was almost something more, as if by just being somewhere in Achamaeda you could be happy and content, and somehow never know it.  You could feel it everywhere, like it was a kind of humidity, almost.  It’s a challenge to explain…”  “How poetic, Edgar.” murmured Jurian.  “I lived there until the Parsarguard disintegrated.  It’s been anarchy and civil war there ever since…must be something like fifty years now,” said Edgar, trailing off into his own memories.  “You know,” pronounced Élan, “I’ve always wondered why Isardis or Gol Trachos never invaded Achamaeda.  They’re leaderless and divided—perfect pickings for the bigger dogs of Ociedies.”  “Achamaeda is huge,” murmured Edgar, mostly to himself, “and after fifty years of civil war there’s one thing the Achamaedans are good at: resistance.  You’d never be able to hold onto it. Sooner or later someone’d kick you out.”   “But no one’s even tried.”  At this point the conversations in the room quieted, most of the eyes and all of the ears trained on both Élan and Edgar.  “How do you know, Mr. D’Bethne?  How can you?”  Élan shrugged.  “Well, I can’t.”  Edgar smiled.  “Precisely.”  Élan paused.  “What do you mean?”  “If governments told their people of what really occurred behind the scenes, of all the battles lost, of how many people were killed, how many governments do you think would last?”  “None?” asked Élan, cautiously.  “Absolutely none.  There’s no doubt in my mind that Alexius has tried a few things in Achamaeda, I’ve seen little bits of evidence here and there—I have a brother that works for him, you know—but, yes, there have been several attempts, secret ones, mind you, of organizing a puppet government there, however they have all failed.  None of the groups or tribes or sects or whatever you want to call them have lasted more than a few decades.  The oldest one was wiped out twenty years ago.”  “So Achamaeda is an example of anarchy in action, then?”  “It’s as close as it’s ever likely to get.”  “When was the last time you went there?”  Edgar shook his head; a smile pushed apart his cherubic cheeks.  “I haven’t gone back since my childhood.  Haven’t had the time or the patience.”  “‘I had time, but ran out of time to have it…’”  “What’s that?” asked Edgar, thinking that he hadn’t heard Élan correctly.  “Just an old lyric I heard awhile ago.”  “How intriguing.”  The conversations around them began to resume, and until they arrived at Vadaina the trip was largely uneventful.  For a few more hours Élan contemplated his existence in the way that depressed teenagers do, repeating the why’s and if’s after every few sentences.  He avoided speaking to Edgar and had declined to indulge himself in any more Rennel, feeling not only quite full but also slightly nauseous.  Toward the end of the flight a bit of turbulence hit the craft, and Élan felt the lump in his stomach climb to his throat.  With widened eyes he rushed out of the cabin, emerging on the outdoor deck and vomiting mucus into the air.  He wiped off his face, felt even more depressed, and then raised his eyes to meet the isle of Vadaina in the distance.  The feeling of depression managed to subside.  There were many tropical islands scattered about the circumference of the wide, blue Zesphyran, most of them uninhabited—but few of them had the look of regal grandeur that Vadaina possessed.  It was a large island, placed atop bright waters that hurt the eyes to look at.  The capital city of Susa was largely the cause of this regal grandeur, for it was enormous, its modest homes painted bright white, the plazas and squares colored extravagantly, the tall obelisks built by the last governor rising into the sky from the Royal Palace.  Another zeppelin was docked at the aeroport, and many large freighters and pleasure yachts were racing to and fro the harbor.  Élan stayed outside for the remainder of the flight, watching in silence as the zeppelin in the distance floated away, while the one he was on drifted toward the dock tower, where elevators would take them several stories down to the green-grassed airfield below.  He said his goodbyes to Edgar, mentioned that they’d have to get together sometime later.  Edgar laughed, murmured a “you’re too kind” and proceeded to lumber off with his friends, the gaunt Jurian following closely behind, his bony, cadaverous hands placing his shiny top hat snugly above bald his skull.  The sun beat down on them much harder than it had in Nelence, and Élan felt sweat gathering at his armpits.  His lazy eyes searched the airfield for Salax, and after the crowd had subsided Élan located his friend, who had taken to admiring the zeppelin in the air above them.  Élan remembered, then, that Salax had always held an affinity for flight, and the science behind it.  Salax, the current Duke of Vadaina, was of a medium height, strikingly handsome, and well built.  He had been an avid swordsman since his early years, and local legend had it that he could defeat anyone in Ociedies in a skirmish.  His eyes carried a look of intimate wonder about, as well as a confidence that Élan found that he had always admired.  He had looked up to his friend, had idolized his better aspects since they had met in their early childhood.  Salax had a cocky attitude that never subsided, and it took quite a bit of digging to reveal the better part of him.  Here was what a ruler should be.  Young, charismatic, at least professing to be intelligent, able to listen, able to intimidate—”  “So are you going to keep staring at me like that or say hello?”  Élan’s eyes refocused.  He grinned, Salax grinned as well, and they laughed.  “Sorry…it’s just that I puked on the way over, guess I ate too much Rennel, and, well—”  “You puked!  Well, isn’t that just a fantastic bit of information!  You’ll have to tell me all about it…” It was then that Salax’s crepuscular servant and cab driver stepped forward, seemingly from nowhere.  He did so almost like a ghost, but not in as much of a terrifying fashion.  “Lunch will be ready soon, m’lord,” he murmured, his eyes drooping to the green grass at their feet.  “Excellent timing, Tenner!”  he turned to Élan.  “Ready for some royal cuisine, from the hallowed halls of Susa Palace?” Élan shrugged.  “Well, I was told that I had to return to Nelence as soon as possible, the Council is supposed to have already started…”  “Great!  Tenner, have the outdoor table set, and invite some of your friends along, if you like.  We’ll make a party out of it!” The old servant shrugged, lowering his already low eyebrows.  “Begging your majesty’s pardon, but most of my friends, well, my good friends have been dead for—”  “I didn’t ask for your life’s story, Tenner.  Just do it.”  “Yes, m’lord.  My apologies.”  Salax laughed, seemingly forcefully.  “Not at all!”  Élan took Salax by the shoulder, a serious look in his eyes.  “Salax—I’m serious.  We have to get going.  Now.  They only invite the power players to Council Meetings.  And only a few times a year.”  “Don’t spoil the fun, Élan.  You’re on Vadaina, now.  Nothing else matters, remember?” Élan only replied with the dark expression on his face.  “You’re serious?”  Élan nodded.  Salax sighed.  “Alright, alright, guess I’ll have to stop everything.”  He turned to Tenner, who had managed, by this time, to pull his haggard body several feet away, toward the car.  “Tenner—cancel the lunch.  We’ll dig up your friends later.  Have my things packed for a few days’ journey and meet me back here in one hour.  Tell my dad that I’m leaving for Nelence and should be back soon.  Got it?”  Tenner nodded, glumly, before continuing upon his arduous hike to the car.  “You’ve got to love the spirit these guys have.  Never ceases to amaze me.”  Élan looked to the sky, saw the sandblasted tip of the obelisk poking itself above the red roofs of the Susa abodes.  The streets of the city were packed with motorcars, speeding to and fro the ocean and the various tourist attractions.  Élan could see a white line of sand bordering the turquoise bathwater sea, noticed even at this distance that the beach was crowded to the brim with both the natives and the tourists—mere people that had fled the mainland to vacation in paradise.  They were still standing at the zeppelin landing field, its edges sparsely populated by tall, swaying palm trees.  Another blimp was already approaching, this one significantly larger than the one Élan traveled on.  It could have come all the way from Gol Trachos.  “This place is just packed, Salax,” said Élan as he started to walk toward the streets.  “Your surplus must be incredible.” Salax grinned, raised his eyebrows.  “We make so much money here we hardly have to tax anyone at all.  Most of the taxes go straight to the Feds in Nelence, the rest go to providing free health care, dental care, large, wealthy publics schools, places to sleep for the rare Vadaina homeless person.  The tourist industry has really sunk its claws into my dad, though…” He sighed.  “I think he’s been taking bribes, letting them slack up on keeping things sanitary and safe.  I don’t know why, we have enough money as it is.”  “Nobody ever has enough money, Sal.”  “Well then I guess we have so much that anything else would seem like just a drop in the bucket.”  “What have you been spending it on lately?”  “Improvements, like the obelisk.  We have a big, bronze statue planned to be on the east coast.”  “Like the Colossus, the Colossus at Antigua?  “Bigger.  Much, much bigger.  We’re thinking of giving it a silver plating, so you could see it from the mainland.  Colossus won’t be a big enough word to describe it.  Maybe we’ll call it the Mega…ultra…lithon.  The Megaultralithon.”  He smiled again.  “Well,” murmured Élan, sticking his hands into his pockets, “at least having so much money hasn’t gotten to your head, right?” Then they smiled together, as old friends do.       II  A woman named Drazir Loguen pressed her finger against the cold metal trigger of her rifle, felt the weapon buck, saw a flash, felt her ears thrum in pain with the loud roar that ushered forth from its nozzle.  Its body was suddenly warm, and she could hear a light hiss emanate from the end, where a small funnel of steam was rising.  At the other end of No-Man’s-Land, a muddy, corpse-strewn wasteland of soggy mutilation, she saw her target, a tall thin man, running toward her with his rifle at hand.  An instant after she had pressed the trigger his shoulder burst into red plasma, and he fell into the soil of the battlefield.  Her first kill.  Drazir fell back behind the trench she had dug herself into, it was more like a hole, far from the protected ranks of her countrymen behind her, she was quite alone, and quite likely to perish from the perpetual hail of gunfire streaming from the rebel insurgents in front of her.  She felt a pang of sadness, a strange feeling envelop her, almost euphoria, but not quite.  Her first kill.  Someone who would have lived at least a little longer, had she not fired, was now just another mangled, lifeless body.  The man had parents who would never see him again, probably a love of his life who feared for his safety every waking moment, who cried at his departure for the battlefield, her eyes more radiant than usual, maybe children, who were the joy of his life, who tinkered with his very perception of what reality was, who made him question philosophies he had taken for granted, many friends who smiled at him and shook their heads whenever he made a stupid joke.  An entire existence had just ended, and an entire slew of people, when they learned of his death, would mourn for him perhaps for their entire lives.  If he were alive…if he were alive.  Combat.  She saw another target making for her foxhole.  Instinctively, she lifted her gun and fired again, missed.  She saw the whites of the man’s eyes as he dove for cover twenty or thirty feet away.  She heard the pitch of the distant, almost otherworldly machine guns change, and she ducked down and covered her ears as plumes of wet dirt and blood ruptured around her, the bullets whizzing by centimeters above the thin metal of her helmet, the ground tremoring wildly as screeching shells burst in the mud.  Her wet face grimaced, her eyes shut tightly.  Even with her ears covered the noise was deafening, and as the time ached on she felt desperation climbing in her lungs, up her dirt-clogged throat.  The noise grew to a cataclysm, and she screamed as the snapping and the whizzing and the roars of the distant cannons grew to such a chorus around her that absolutely nothing else could be heard.  The hail of gunfire ended as slowly as it began, gradually tapering off as the gunners found new targets.  Her miserable shrieking did not end until the rumbling earth was still.  And even then it was all her mind’s voice could do, for in trench combat logical thought is silenced, and while she was closer to death than she ever had been before, she never felt more alive.  Combat.  She lifted herself from the wet topsoil, clutching her rifle with a vigorous, battlefield tenacity.  She gasped, eyes widened, and she almost fell backward.  Standing before her, an arm’s length away, was the man, or the boy, who had dived for cover minutes before.  He was stupid—greatly inexperienced, if you stood up you were dead—and for some inexplicable reason he lacked a firearm.  Something had happened to it.  But he was a boy, just a boy, not even an adolescent.  What a life he must have led.  A life of never ending terror in the midst of anarchy, in the midst of chaos.  To grow up in Achamaeda is a thought only beheld in nightmares.  These thoughts flew through her mind as she silently lifted her rifle, took aim, and fired.    His eyes seemed subtracted suddenly, and he looked down to the wound, touched it with hands that were immediately covered in blood, and then collapsed out of view.  Drazir tried to push the encroaching despair out of her mind, tried to think of happier things, and not about the child she had just murdered, who, if given a normal life, would have been playing on a merry-go-round with his friends…instead of this miserable carnage no sane man could endure for long.  She had grown up in Tehillo, a sunny province in the south of Isardis, had lived a quiet, gentle life as a bright-eyed little girl.  She fought with the boys sometimes, and somehow always beat them, whether they were stronger than her or not.  Drazir had a certain animal ferocity, a primal instinct in combat that allowed her to master her foe subconsciously, allowing her to exploit to full advantage every weak point, every unique area of tenderness.  She was so young, the memories were few and seemed to her to be full more of feeling and emotion rather than imagery.  She felt so loved, and so content.  Then she was whisked away, taken by troops to the Imperial Academy at Nelence, where she would spend the next fifteen years of her life training to be a lethal predator, on of only a few Ariladats, the greatest of warriors, chosen by the Queen herself in paradise before she was born to be an undefeatable warrior.  Then, when she had graduated with as many awards and honors as they permitted, she had been given her first command in Achamaeda, a place she had heard of many times before, an awful, cruel, dark bastion of hell, where civil strife had been raging for upwards of fifty years.  This was the true Academy.  Few survived it.  Another foe began a sprint from some foxhole toward her.  She lifted her rifle and tightened her finger over the trigger, waiting for euphoria to envelop her once again.    	The sun fell below the shoulders of the horizon, and the city of Nelence emerged in glorious twilight, her lights and windows sparkling in magnificent necklaces draped luxuriously over her buildings and towers and skyscrapers.  Far above the tallest buildings stood a Cyclopean relic, a pristine cylinder of architectural brilliance that had stood at a height of over a hundred and fifty stories since the birth of Isardis.  It was Isardis—in all of its immortal grandeur, among the clouds, higher than heaven.  	At its top floor, peering through a window onto the city below, stood the King Alexius IV.  He was a tall man, and although his body was very old it still seemed to echo a strength not found often.  Here was a warrior, an Ariladat, the greatest of fighters, the strongest, and the bravest of creatures, who had proven himself above all others to the previous King, and was thus nominated as his successor.  Alexius’ face, reflected in the warm candlelight emanating from a chandelier, conveyed this character almost as much as his actions would.  It was lean and straight, the nose was thin and the eyes large and round, the pupils never dilating behind green irises.    	Behind him, sitting at a regal desk reserved for public officials, was Ignav Semmel.  A thin man of average height, he sported dark, beady eyes, his face masculine but not handsome by any stretch of the imagination, his jaws large and noticeable.  His cheeks tightened and his thin lips widened, and from behind them came a flawless set of white teeth, giving his smile a certain notability, one which could be easily interpreted as being of either good intentions or of venomous sarcasm.   The document he sat reading was a thin book entitled “The Manifesto of Ahken,” a religious scripture from a zealot expelled from Isardis several months before, the man taking refuge in Tharad, the sprawling capital city of Isardis’ mortal enemy, Gol Trachos, and continuing to denounce the “capitalist-imperialist” Isardan government.  He had been candidly interviewed by the foreign press (Isardan media was loosely controlled by the government) and followers of his; calling themselves “Ahkenatens” would distribute his propaganda throughout the provinces of the nation.  It seemed like since he was born the man had been trying unsuccessfully to start a revolt.  Just before he was expelled he had started a small riot in western Tehillo, one which was immediately put down by the Isardan military police and never allowed mention in the press.  He was quietly expelled and threatened with his life if he returned.  But it seemed now that no matter where he went the man caused trouble for the Isardan aristocracy.  “The Trachans love him, don’t they?”  asked Alexius, still watching the lights of the cars in the chasm below.  “They’ll make any excuse to start another war with us.  Every war that we’ve fought, every war that they’ve fought, has been about economics.  Our companies and corporations battling theirs for global dominion.” “Hegemony?”  “Neither power has it.  Neither power has ever had it.”  Much of the world had been discovered in the last few years, most of it ocean, mainland Ociedies remaining the center of culture and civilization.  A few small continents and cultures had been found, primitive darkskinned savages who had been warned by someone of the white man, who had fought every pilgrimage with vicious tenacity.  They outnumbered both Isardis and Gol Trachos by a great deal, the barbarians, the savages, but their technology was inferior.  Already the coastal communities had been subdued, and the inhabitants subsequently enslaved by the richer aristocrats publicly not affiliated with Alexius but in reality his closest companions.  “Can he be assassinated?”  Ignav shook his head.  “He’s protected by the Trachan police.  We’re the only nation with the resources to kill him off, they’d know it was us if we managed to do so.”  Alexius turned from the window, began to pace the room.  “I heard a strange theory from the man.  He was explaining how all men and women have a natural, primal fear of reptiles.  Do you know what I’m talking about, Ignav?”  “I think so.”  “He says that a very, very long time ago, before there was civilization, before there was technology, there was a race of lizard-men that coexisted with humanity.  Called Saurians, you know.  Supposedly they only lived around the brims of volcanoes, which were a bit more common back then, however over time the two species began to quarrel.”  “And we didn’t do so well.”  “They were better fighters, much larger, much smarter than us.  Their technology was on the same level—still fairly primitive, but we were outmatched.  The war was over the course of several thousand years, and soon whomever had a natural fear of lizards managed to survive and reproduce.” “And the Saurians?”  Alexius smiled.  “This is where it gets weird—”   “It was already weird.”  “I know.  Anyway, the Saurian deity, Tiamat, an enormous dragon representing fire and chaos battled our god, Terra, who represented water and peace, and Terra won.  She separated the planet into two hunks, one with the Saurians and one with the humans.  One of them flew off into space, the other one is where we live now.”  “And all this happened…?”  “Hundreds of thousands of years ago.”  “And the evidence…?”  “Is nonexistent.  It’s more or less a theory he’s compiled from oral tradition, from mythological accounts and stories passed down from that time period.”  “Alexius I’m surprised you’ve taken the time to read up on our enemy zealot here.  The man is clearly crazy—he wants no class distinction, everyone to be educated at the same schools, he’s just insane.  But the people seem to believe him,” Ignav paused, “instead of us.  Which is why he has to die.”  “Can we pay off some foreign mercenaries?  New Worlders?  Achamaedans?”  “Like I said they’d never be able to do it, not in a thousand years.”  “Then how do we do it, Ignav?”  He grinned once more, a sly, vicious baring of his teeth.  “We go to war.”  	Alexius sighed.  “I don’t think it’s quite economically feasible at the moment, Ignav—”  	“That’s why I’ve called a council together, one of all the aristocrats and wealthy businessmen from Isardis.  All of our associates, friends, and relatives who have dealings in world power politics will be here.  Together we’ll decide the proper course of action.”  	“I’d rather war be a last resort…”  	“Tell it to the rich people, Alexius.”  	Alexius’ eyes drifted back to the window, and he began to walk toward it, across the soft, crimson carpet at his feet.  He reached the edge, and resumed his watching of the populace, his eyes following the lights of the cars in the streets below.  “Ignav…Ignav you know we have no army.  The Tehillo Accord prevents us from having any more than 20,000 troops, hardly a police force—”  	“Then we’ll raise a new army.”  	“That costs money.  People.  Political power.  The Trachans are sure to find out.” “Then we raise the army in secrecy.  Have them train in Achamaeda for a few months.”  A sly grin began to spread across Ignav’s face.  “The Ariladats will be reborn.”  Alexius’ eyes stopped.  “Ariladats?”  “I know you were once one of them, Alexius.  They were vicious warriors; their foes were outmatched if the Ariladat party was outnumbered ten to one.  The Ariladat Warrior Tradition goes back to the time before Isardis, the word is actually a Somaran term.  The native warrior bands joined our ranks in the first war against the Trachans, and were absorbed over the centuries.  Until…”  “Until I dissolved them.”  “Because…?”  “They were vicious, they went to war for immoral reasons (Ignav scoffed).  They went to pillage and loot, not to defend the nation, not to defend the True Faith, not to defend the Queen.  I was only briefly an Ariladat.”  “You were one long enough to be officially recognized by the last Emperor of Isardis.  To be made a candidate for vid-imperator.”  Ignav pushed himself out of his chair, approached Alexius’ side.  He crept up to his ear, slowly whispered “What made you so different?”  Alexius’ head craned to Ignav’s face.  “Moral aptitude.”    Ignav’s smile merely widened.  “A soldier for Peace, Justice, and the True Faith, eh?”  “You act like you hardly know me, Ignav.  I’ve known you almost my entire life.”  “I’m just making sure that we’re on the same page—”  Alexius grabbed both of Ignav’s shoulders, shook them violently.  “We are not on the same page!”  And for the space of the minute, their widened eyes were locked.  Alexius loosed his grip.  The Emperor began to walk out of the room, head cast low, fists balled.  He stopped at the door, turned his head ever so slightly.  “There will be no war.”     	The blinding heat of the sun was obscured for a moment behind a thick cloud, temporarily bathing the regal city of Susa in a cool shadow.  Élan and Salax walked together along the red-paved streets, laughing and joking together, reminiscing about old times.  It had been too long—far too long, since they had seen each other.  The crowds on Vadaina were thick, the streets were packed with cars and the sidewalks brimming with people, people of all different sorts.  Old people, young people, handsome people, ugly people, all passing by Élan and Salax, some looking at them, some ignoring them, and some simply not noticing.  The one binding similarity between most of them was their smiles, for, each was bloomed.  	“So are you still with Hara?”  asked Élan.  	“I was waiting for you to ask.  Yes, of course I’m still with Hara.”  	Élan scoffed.  “Well.  I’m very happy for you.”  	Salax nodded, and smiled.    They walked on, and the conversation entered a lull.  Hara.  Yes, Salax knew Hara.  Hara.  A creature descended from the heavens, from gleaming clouds.  She brought it with her, brought the divine grace of the gods, the wisps of zephyr barreling about the cosmos.  It was a hard thing to explain, almost, almost like a feeling that Salax discerned when he touched her hair.  He could feel it emanating from her, pulsing from her, and when he touched her, saw her, spoke to her, the love, the feeling, the pervasive thing, the clouds, the beauty…it seemed to clot in his bloodstream, and slow his brain activity.  A glance at her eyes, the faint tinges of a smile on the edges of her lips, allowed everything around her to blur in Salax’s vision, every sound but the ones she made smothered, every smell extinguished.  She seemed to be the only source of light in the room, and it was obvious to most that everything but her was of the earth, was dirty, chthonic, and she was…simply…something else.  Something better.  Above them all, above Salax, above any King, any Queen.  	“Well I can see that by the lost look in your eyes the zest hasn’t left this relationship.”  	Salax sighed, shook his head, then looked back at Élan, still sporting the expression of abandon that permeated his face’s every molecule whenever the topic of Hara was mentioned.  “Élan…I think I’m going to marry her.”  	Élan shrugged.  “Comes as no surprise, really.  You two were in love with each other before you even met.  What’s taken you so long?”  	Salax laughed, uneasily.  “Fear.”  	Élan knew the feeling.  Everything rested on her.  Salax’s ability to enjoy life, to live, rested on her.  Élan had felt that way about another, about many others, but Hara was the only woman Salax ever spent any extended amount of time with.  The rest were only temporary enjoyment, while Hara was…permanent.  “She loves you, Sal.  She’ll say yes.”  	“I hope so…I can only hope so.”  	Élan waited until they had finished rounding a city corner before continuing.  “When are you going to ask?”  	Salax stopped, his eyes fixed on the window of a restaurant on the other side of the street.  “Right now.”  	He walked through the traffic, the cars stopping for him and honking as he made his way alone into the restaurant, where Élan realized that Hara must have worked as a waitress.  Picturing her in a dirtier, more menial task just didn’t seem to fit.  	Inside, Salax passed by several occupied tables (the dining room was small, but cozy), the people sitting at them too busy looking out the window to notice him.  The door to the kitchen opened, and she emerged.  The backdrop of conversations and voices, clattering plates and utensils, honking cars outside, footsteps on the wood floor—all of it—ceased.  The wall behind her blurred, the lights dimmed, and she brightened, like a newborn star in the void.  Ever so slowly her eyes flicked to him, and he felt the feeling, the power thrumming through him.  The muscles of her cheeks contracted, her lips widened into a reclusive smile, a shy one.  But the eyes remained where they were.  	They approached one another, the restaurant around them all but frozen in time.  	Salax returned her smile.  “Kind of melodramatic, isn’t it?”  	“Life is always melodramatic.”  	“I’ve never understood it,” said Salax, looking back and forth, at the lifeless faces of tanned the tourists around him, “this isn’t some kind of fantasy or delusion.  What’s happening is…is real.  Tangible.  You see it too?”  	“Always.”  	They came closer, he took her hands, felt the sweat of a day’s labor on them.  He lifted them to just below her neck, held them there, both of their faces nearly touching, their eyes trying to pierce one another’s, trying to see past the barrier of skin into what they loved more than existence.  	He said it.  	“Marry me?”  	She nodded.  	And then it was over.  Suddenly the people in the restaurant were alive and watching them eagerly.  One clapped his hands, slowly.  The rest soon followed suit, and the blurred lens that seemed to cover their eyes dissipated, the gleam of the sun off of the automobiles outside hurting their iris’.  They laughed, together, as one, instead of two.  They were now only separate in physical form, but they both knew that individuality was gone—that in mind, spirit, soul, or any other words assigned to such a thing, they were one.  Perhaps it had always been this way, perhaps they had never noticed, but it seemed as if this was a prime example of what mythical love truly is.  That it is different from anything else, from petty attractions egged on by the hormones clouding the blood vessels of human brains, of animal brains.  It seems that it is easily a thing that transcends humanity and reality, and connects in a realm that is beyond the facile, crude matter that permeates the universe.  	Some time later, it all seemed so fast when he was there, but, yes, it seemed that Salax D’Vadai managed to pull himself away from his love (who had to work) to attend to his other duties (which, in all honesty, could wait).  He left with Élan, for the gleaming metropolis of Nelence, on the other side of the world, to speak of politics with his Emperor.    He heard the door behind him click open, recognized the hesitant step of his son.  His left hand tightened over a golden staff, the ornament passed on from King to King, since the foundation of Isardis.  	Alexius hated his son.  	He turned, his eyes met his son’s face—and he saw himself in the man before him, the despicable man before him, the man that would plunder the throne if left to rule.  Little bits and pieces of his long-deceased mother had melted together with his own in the man’s face, most specifically his nose, which was flat and round, almost like a pig’s, ruining the handsomeness of our genetics, thought the King.  Alexius had always hated the nose.  He had wanted his son to look exactly like himself; he had wanted a clone, not an offspring, but a duplicate that would go beyond his wildest expectations.  Since the boy’s birth he had been disappointed, always disappointed.  An abysmal failure on his own part, for even wanting a son.  	He wasn’t a boy anymore, though—that much was sure.  He was old now, his long hair had started to gray, wrinkles had begun to grin under his eyes and around his mouth.  Every day he looked more and more like Alexius, and every day he acted less and less like him.  The woman he had finally found to marry, a princess from the province of Davan, was a whore—nothing more than a filthy whore from a poor, filthy province, birthed from the lips of a whore mother, conceived by a bastard father.  It showed in her face, in her consistent disrespect toward Alexius, in her defiance—she was a harlot, and although he hated his son, and had secretly loathed him for as long as he had existed, he knew that if there was any hope of saving Isardis that the next heir down the line, his grandson, would have to be strong.  He needed a strong mother, a cunning mother, a beautiful mother.  Not unlike that girl he had met yesterday at the council…what was her name…Hara.  Such a pity, thought Alexius, Hara will never see her husband again.  	Alexius realized that he had been glaring silently at his son this whole time, his fingers white over the ornate orb at the end of his staff.    	“I’ve had enough of this, father.  Cassandra is in hysterics after what you pulled tonight.  You two hate each other.  You hate my wife.  You hate your own daughter.”   	Alexius felt his rage churn about, and he had great difficulty restraining himself.  Sweat began to perspire on his hands, and a bead of moisture ran down the golden surface of the staff.  “I’ll disown you if you call her my daughter ever again, Alex.  She is the daughter of a harem.  If you have anything sensible to say you’d better say it now before I call the guards.”  	“Guards?  Guards?  You dare to call the guards on me?  You’re delusional, father, you’ve really lost it this time—”  	“Enough!  I have decided.  If you marry her you will not inherit the throne.”  	Alex tried to speak, but his father’s intensified glare silenced him.  	“Get that…bitch on a train back to Davan.  I don’t want to ever see you two together again.”  	Alex closed his eyes tightly with his father’s words, then opened them with a renewed passion, and stepped forward, his boots clicking on the marble floor.  He came face-to-face with his father, their noses nearly touching, each with his face soaked in sweat.  “Don’t…” and he paused, realizing the gravity of his defiance, “call her that.”  	Alexius felt the anger boil over, felt it thrum through his broadening veins.  He gritted his teeth together, lifted the golden staff into the air, and heard its otherworldly swoop as his arms brought it down over Alex’s head, smashing the skull, soaking the round orb at the end in blood.  Alex didn’t crumple, but fell, as a tree does when it is cut down, his boots clattering on the marble.  Alexius dropped the staff, and felt a lurch in his stomach.    What have I done?    The King fell forward, on his knees, lifted the bleeding head in his hands, the fluids dripping onto his extravagant satin robes.  He could see the folds of the brain through the gaping breach in the skull, could see then that there was no hope.  He dropped Alex to the floor and backed away on all fours to the window, squeezed himself into the fetal position and began to shake, his breath coming in wheezes and gasps.    	What have I done?  	It felt like a waterfall, like the deafening roar of a waterfall, the memories of his son flooding his mind, thrashing about.  I loved my son.  He saw Alex’s birth, his little face in his arms, his screaming mouth, how he was covered in disgusting liquid…but then noticed how he calmed as he felt the heartbeat of his father, felt his chest expanding with his breath.  He saw Alex playing on a beach, the wind was strong, he heard his laugh, the laugh of a happy child, and saw a red kite intense against a blue, cloudless sky.  He saw Alex playing in the bathtub with his mother, splashing her with bubbles, screaming with glee.  It was all there, the love that he had never admitted to feel, the flood of it drenching his mind.  	What have I done?  	The guards charged into the room, swords and pistols drawn, only seconds after the event had taken place.  They  shouted “Where is the killer,” to the King, but the King didn’t reply, said nothing, as the Royal Doctor arrived from the party several floors down, not even bothering to take out his tools, seeing, as the King did, as the murderer did, that there was no hope for the body of the King’s only heir, which now lay in a dark, crimson pool of its own blood.  Murderer.  	What have I done?  	The King lay there, curled at the window, as the early morning arrived.  Guards had been posted nearby, and his officials had been shouting at him for hours, begging to get a word out of him, but finding it impossible.  The body was taken away by a coroner, the blood cleaned by a tear-eyed maiden from the polished marble floor.  He overheard the guards talking about how the princess had been informed, how she had cried and then left without a word to anyone.  It was all Alexius’ fault, everything was his fault.  I am a murderer.  He clenched his fists at the thought, his breath coming in haggard wheezes.  The guards heard, and they rushed to his aide, picking him up and carrying him through the hallways that the King saw in only a blur, his eyes wandering the painted portraits of past rulers and generals and great men, each with his own frame of opulent gold.  But my frame will forever be stained red.  He was dumped into his bed, and the guards began to shout for help.  He heard the thumping of more feet on the floor, noticed he couldn’t move his body, his vision narrowing to a pinpoint of light.  The noise around him blurred, thickened, and he blacked out.   	He awoke, taking a deep breath of air in.  The memories caught up with him, immediately, and he felt despair once again, lying back in his fluffed pillows, his hands tightly gripping his bedcovers.  The sun was golden through the windows; he guessed that he had been out an entire day.

      ***Some new writing pieces, first, a rough draft of a new short scifi story I've been working on.  It's going to go under some big changes before it's finished, if it's finished at all, so, fans, don't hold your breaths.***  Tingling.  I felt tingling, all over.  Painful pricks nipped at my skin, my muscles, my eyes, my head.  I had a headache, a splitting headache…everything hurt almost beyond description, and my ears were ringing.  I think my eyes were opened at that point, although I couldn’t see anything, my vision was completely blurred over.  No color, no objects, nothing.  Almost like my eyes were closed.  I tried to undo my restraining harness, but I couldn’t move my arms.  Memory came back slowly.  I was in cold sleep, just a moment ago they had closed the metal cocoon I was in, I remembered hearing the hiss, feeling my heartbeat slow.  The blood rushed to my ears, and then…I was awake again.  Something must have gone wrong.  First my hearing returned.  The ringing cleared and softened, and was replaced by the frantic klaxons of the starship.  This put my on edge.  I had to get out, but everything still hurt, all my muscles were sore, like I had won the decathlon only a minute ago.  The headache had turned to dizziness, and I was painfully nauseous, my stomach seemed to be devouring itself.  I couldn’t think straight; I was dreaming…I was back on Earth, back in Maine, before the Idelek hit us, when it was still sunny, when the chirps of birds drifted about in the air, and when there were still birds to chirp at all.  Shimmering trees, wind, sea, and stars…  Another prick, much stronger, on my right upper arm.  I was back in reality.  I felt a coldness seep from the prick, felt it dilate as it flew through my blood vessels.  It met my heart, and then lanced across the rest of my body, tingling my spine and the back of my neck, rolling like a satin blanket across the folds of my brain.  My muscles were renewed, and they flexed themselves on their own without my command.  My blurred eyes cleared almost instantly, and I could see once more.  The shell of the cocoon was opened, it seemed, and the small amphitheater holding the crew was dark but periodically flashed red.  Steam was fissuring out from the other cocoons, the caskets were opening slowly, and the people inside of them were dead still, their faces still blue from the cold sleep.  Next to me was a small service robot clutching a large, empty syringe at the end of one of its thin arms.  I unbuckled my harness and climbed out of the cocoon, my bare feet hitting the cold metal grating.  The klaxons were still blaring.  “Report?”  I asked, aloud.  The piece in my ear crackled, and the soothing voice of a motherly female came on the line.  “Heavy damage to all starship systems, Atmosphere failure on all loading decks, speed falling to below One Hundred LS, coolant leakage in all propellant tanks—”  “What happened?  Was it the Idelek?”  “Unknown.”  “Status of soldiers?”  “No casualties at this time.  Casualties predicted to reach 100% in under ten minutes, fifteen seconds.” 	 “Suggested course of action?” 	 “None.  Captain’s discretion.” 	 Wow.  This wasn’t good.  The most complex machine brain ever created by man didn’t know what to do.  They told us that was statistically impossible.  And yet, here I was, standing near the cocoons of my command crew, almost naked, and without any idea as to what I should do.  I heard a voice in my head, or maybe it was a feeling, probably came from the heavy hypnosis they put commanders through.  It was instinct, that’s what it was.  It said: follow procedure.  You don’t know what the hell to do, so do what the book tells you to.  I didn’t know what a book was but that was beside the point.  It was just a figure of expression. 	 “Engage Alert Protocol Alpha.  Wake the entire command crew immediately.” 	 Monitors next to each of the cocoons beeped, and the flat lines that represented their heartbeats slowly began to revive.  I could already see some of their eyes moving beneath their eyelids, the expressions of disgust and pain spreading across their faces.  But I didn’t have time for this, I couldn’t wait for them.  I took off in a dead sprint, climbed out of the sleep chamber and whizzed through the corridors of the starship, the painful fluorescent lights above coming on as I moved beneath them.  The cockpit door hissed as it opened, and I flew past the dark computer consoles and beeping readouts, taking my seat in the pilot’s chair.  The ship was on autopilot, and so was I. 	 Instinct instinct instinct. 	 As my hands flew across the console in front of me I managed to glimpse out the small window at the front of the cockpit.  To my great surprise there was a planet there.  Still quite far away, the planet seemed to be almost entirely water, but even at this distance I could see that it was scarred by white clouds.  The only landmass I could see was toward its center and very small, very green as well— 	 Amongst the chorus of beeps, a louder one tugged my eyes back to the computer screen below my fingertips.  It looked like there had been some kind of engine explosion just after deceleration had started, most of the engine room had been incinerated, and there was a large hole into space.  Thank the president, the troopers hadn’t been touched.  They were still sound asleep at the heart of the starship.  But then there was a new beep, that signature alarm that every starship captain fears, that every living man dreads more than death itself.  	 “Relativity bubble collapsing,” said the voice in my ear, “Time dilation will increase exponentially in t-minus two minutes.” 	  One of my crewmates came out of nowhere and sat down next to me, I didn’t bother to look at her, I had more important things on my mind.  The Relativity Bubble was the pride of the human conquest of nature, somehow (I was no astrophysicist) it pulled a bubble of another dimension around the hull of our ship, a dimension that had a looser model of physics, that allowed us to move through space at untold speeds using a minimum amount of energy, while also keeping the world outside from aging faster than we were. 	 But if the bubble collapsed, it would all be over.  We’d drop to an infinitesimal fraction below the speed of light, and whole human lifetimes would fly by outside that window with every beat of my heart.  And you can be sure that my heartbeat was going pretty fast by then, even after being in stasis for a few months. 	 “Saskia,” that was her name, “can we keep the bubble in one piece or do we need to decelerate?” 	 She shook her head (to which question I didn’t know at the time), and I noticed that she was actually quite attractive.  “I’ll try to slow us down.  It’s a long shot, but the best shot that we have.” 	 My eyes went back to the planet ahead of us.  “Is there any way that we could use that planet to slow us down?” 	 She shook her head, not looking up from her console. “Too small.  We need a heavier gravity well.” 	 I typed out several commands onto the computer in front of me, realizing how clunky my fingers were on the keyboard, and also wondering how long it would take for the computer to interface with my consciousness.  It had been…what, three minutes since I woke up?  Why was it taking so long? 	 The planet ahead of us was actually a moon, from the looks of it.  There was a gas giant a few times the size of Jupiter…just to our right.  We would likely tear the planet apart by flying through it, with so much mass, but it was the best that we could do under the circumstances.  The nearest Red Supergiant was lightyears away, at our speed it would take days to get there, and we only had minutes.  I didn’t like to get too technical.  With my hands on the control sticks, I eased the nose of the ship just a little to the side, allowing us a few of a green crescent packed with wrathful, swirling clouds.  The planet was so big…so big, even at this distance.  I nodded to the window. 	 “How’s that?” 	 She looked at it for a few seconds, her eyes trembling as she thought, considered, checked her calculations.  She looked back to me, smiled.  “Couldn’t hurt.” 	 I plotted a course that would take us almost straight through the planet, only a few miles above what my computer told me was a core of solid diamond.  I wonder if I’d get to see it, through all the clouds.   Then the interface hit me, like a metal can that had been in a freezer for a few hours suddenly pressed up against the back of my neck, like the feeling you get when your teacher scratches her long nails on the chalkboard to get your attention.  It was such a rush, I had to close my eyes and smile for a second, let my mind feel and comprehend the status of every molecule on board.  And that’s no exaggeration.  You really have to love Nanotechnology. 	 Now it would be a walk in the park, guiding the ship through the titan looming in front of us.  All in the space of less than a second I had switched the ship’s hull reinforcements onto full power and pumped ten mg of preparatory stimulant into the fifteen thousand men sleeping at the heart of the ship.  Another restraining harness guided itself across my chest and connected with its locks at my thighs.  Warning lights flicked on and flashed, Saskia tried to keep up with them but couldn’t.  She sat back from her console and could only watch as I guided the craft in, knowing full well that she could do nothing to help, that she had no interface, didn’t have the rank necessary for one, and would be unable to assist me in any way because of how meaty her fingers were.  Among other things, too, of course, but you get the picture. 	 Titan II, I would call it.  The only other fitting name was simply Titan all by itself, but then there was already a body hovering in space near home by that same name, and I had to be at least a little original.   	 It kept getting bigger and bigger, long before we pierced its skin of gas and haze.  The edges of the fingernail crescent had long since passed out of view of the forward window, and the clouds on the surface merely became more detailed, more evil, I guess you could say.  I could pick out faces, skulls, the dark shadows that form in your eye sockets when you don’t have any eyes to fill them.  Grinning evil, hands stretching out, some of them long and jagged, others packed with fat and muscles, all of them seeming to coalesce at the precise spot that I would fly the ship through.  Even at this distance I could feel the ship’s hulls begin to buckle and creak under the pressure, but she would hold together, she always did.  Through every battle, every Idelek boarding party, every direct hit from their missiles, she had pulled through.  She was a veteran, and made of something more than just metal. 	 Luckily some of the ship’s braking mechanisms were still in good shape, most of them were shot to hell by now, but without them it would be nearly impossible to slow the ship down before the Relativity Bubble snapped.  Even a planet this size wouldn’t do the trick, a Red Supergiant would probably have enough gravity, but even the Idelek didn’t have armor that could survive a trip through the core of a star.  Then there were black holes and other gravitational anomalies, but you’d have to be crazy to go anywhere near one of those things. 	 Yeah, in spite of our bad luck, we still had some good luck on our side.  I could pull her through easy. 	 There.  Passed through the atmosphere.  At this height it’s pretty light stuff, mostly helium I think, but I’m not sure.  It’s mostly green for some reason, I’m not sure why.  I think that it was the first real green planet I’d ever seen.  Uranus has a little bit of a tint to it but you can hardly see it at all because of how far away it is from the sun.  For some reason an image replaced the other readouts and headings in my mind’s eye, an image of my starship, my huge troop transport, the pride of the Federal Navy, being swallowed up in the mouth of a great, verdant cloud, and then disappearing forever, the wisps from my entrance fading as the heavy winds ripped them away.  Of course I wouldn’t be able to see that happening, going faster than light makes you perfectly invisible, but it gave me an odd feeling.  An omen, I guess. 	 More clouds tore by the front window, it would only be a few seconds before we reached the core at the speed we were going.  And it was working, quite well, the ship had slowed down to only a few times the speed of light.  I had to get her down to less than a quarter.  The clouds cleared, quite suddenly, and Saskia gasped beside me.  Something in the atmosphere must have allowed us to see further than we usually did, I guess.  The horizon was so huge, so infinite, the clouds were above, lightening was flashing with a, I don’t know, an anger I guess, such an anger, probably because we had escaped the atmosphere’s gaseous clutches, at least for a few seconds.  Then, below was a blinding necklace of light flying by fast enough to make your heart stop.  Hardly a moment had gone by before it was gone, and we were back in the clouds, flying toward the other end of the planet, the computer telling me that most of the world’s atmosphere was trailing the wake left by the back of the ship. 	 It was working, much better.  The damaged interdiction systems wouldn’t have been able to slow us down on their own, we’d still be going ¾ c at the very least if we didn’t have a planet’s atmosphere to plow through.  As we pulled out back into the stars the speed of my ship dropped exponentially, down to only a few thousand kilometers per hour.  The Relativity Bubble collapsed in what can only be described as a slight shimmer visible through the forward window, and the gas trailing the starship overtook us, tossing the ship about like a caravel in a typhoon.  I felt different systems disappear from my consciousness, one after the other, and as I looked out the window all I could see was a violent, churning green haze.  The ship itself was shaking and tremoring as if an earthquake was splitting its hull, and I looked briefly to my side to see that Saskia had not fastened her safety harness, and her body was jumping about like a rag doll, her eyes closed, a thin stream of blood traveling down her forehead. 	 I couldn’t help her now; I had to hold the ship together.  I could feel the hull straining, feel the metal bending and stretching as an entire planet flew by.  The different tactical radars were mostly shot, but the picture I could glean from them told me that I had torn a huge portion of the gas giant away from itself, leaving a huge projection of freezing particles to travel ahead of me in space.  More systems failed, left and right, my consciousness was going dead.  I had to unhook myself from the computer or I would die with it, I could barely move because so much of my brain’s computing power was occupied with commanding the ship, and I would have to move in order to deactivate the interface.  The interface’s only drawback was that it occupied a huge portion of my brain’s conscious power, forcing it to put most my body on automatic, so that only subconscious functions, like breathing were carried out.  Moving was close to impossible because it wasn’t automatic, it was a conscious action, and my consciousness was being eaten up by the interface. 	 With great effort, I managed to tell my hand to lift itself to the control panel, fighting the staggering g forces and my numbing inability to move my limbs at the same time.  I hit my target, an unambiguous red switch, and everything went black.  	 Idelek.  The Idelek are a race with striking similarities to humanity, in that both Human and Idelek specimens are bipeds.  There are notable differences however.  The Idelek have no color to their eyes, no green, no blue, no brown, their iris’ are all the same and have a kind of polished black coal look to them.  All of the Idelek have the same skin color, which is a pale white with a slight bluish tint, enough to make them look like they’ve been frozen.  Idelek and Human scientists alike don’t know why both species are so similar; it is generally thought that it is just a cosmic coincidence of sorts.  Although I’ve never met an Idelek before, almost no one has, they are thought to be extremely calculative, complex, and egotistical.  They think themselves superior even to other Idelek.   	 The Idelek have been a spacefaring species for longer than any other species encountered by mankind.  The limits to their Empire are unknown, however it is known that several dozen other species of intelligence at about the same level as man have been conquered and either destroyed or used as slave labor.  It is very likely that there are more that mankind has not yet encountered.  Earth itself is actually located near the heart of Idelek space, apparently it was overlooked by the Empire for some odd reason, and the first encounter with the Idelek about two years ago resulted in the destruction of most of humanity’s starship navy and all of its interplanetary and interstellar colonies.  Almost a hundred million people have been either enslaved or killed in the ensuing war.  Although the Idelek are far superior to mankind technologically, because humanity has been almost constantly at war with itself for its entire history (spacefaring and pre-spacefaring) we were well prepared for a fight, and it is believed that we destroyed the first, second, and third waves of their assault, however the most recent wave several weeks ago resulted in the UN losing Eastern Europe to the Idelek.  Fighting is heavy there, and fusion weapons have reduced the occupied area to little more than a scorched hearth.  No ground has been gained for humanity in the war, however colonies on fifty-seven planetary bodies have been destroyed, and it has been estimated that if the tide of the war is uninterrupted Earth will be overrun before the year is out.  The only victory for the UN was the capture of an Idelek sleeper ship, which destroyed itself moments after our parties boarded it.  But before they were incinerated, the men onboard managed to relay the location of the Idelek homeworld back to UN Headquarters in New York City.  	  My starship has been sent with as many soldiers as could be spared from the fight to the heart of Idelek space, virtually undetectable because of its both liberal and unusual use of the Relativity Bubble.  The Idelek homeworld is toward the heart of the Orion Star Nursery, it is thought that the bulk of the Idelek species moved there from somewhere else because of an unalterable environmental problem.  My soldiers have orders to initiate a guerrilla war once we arrive, and I am to attempt to saturation bomb the planet with fusion warheads for as long as possible before the ship itself is destroyed.  Preliminary data suggests that the world is packed with Idelek industry as well as its central feudalist government institutions, so striking it should not only hurt Idelek production capability but cripple moral—   My eyes opened and the briefing playing through my mind ended.  The cockpit was dark, but thrummed to life once the computer detected my stabilizing life signs.  Bent over me like a worried mother was the command crew’s doctor, a dry, old woman, holding what looked like a flashlight in her hand and a piece of bloody gauze in the other.  “Hold still,” cracked her lips.  She aimed the flashlight device at my head, and it beamed a bright, blue light onto my forehead and hummed annoyingly at the same time.  “Little damage, you were just out for a few hours,” she said again, standing up.  I looked over to my side, saw Saskia nursing her head, a bandage wrapped tightly over the cut I had seen before.    I tried to queue the interface but I got nothing.  “Something’s still…wrong,” I breathed, “the computer core…must be down.”  “Techs are working on it, sir,” she said, robotically.  “Try not to stay awake, since you’re still interfaced it’ll only make their job harder.”  I gritted my teeth, the effort to speak exhausting me.  “Status…report.”  She sighed, and looked at Saskia.  Saskia was clearly not in the mood for talking.  “Heavy damage everywhere, sir.  The mission has been compromised, and we’ve detected an Idelek armada moving to intercept us.  They must have seen what we, or what you, did to the planet during our breaking maneuver.  It’s been practically torn apart.”  “Options?”  Saskia closed her eyes and shook her head.  The old battleaxe frowned.  “We’ll tell you when you wake up.  Go to sleep.  That’s an order.”  With that, I felt a prick in my arm.  My vision narrowed, and the voices of the people around me began to blur and dull.  Memories enveloped me once again.   I am afraid.  This is my first commission, on board a ship so new that the engineers didn’t have time to give it a name before they pushed it out into space.  My training isn’t complete, I’m still clunky with the interface even after using it for my entire life.  I have no combat experience and I’m only seventeen.  The youngest starship captain.  The fleet is in a loose combat array, they’re only visible as shimmering stars against the backdrop of the universe, and behind me is my homeworld, still bright and blue as ever.  We know they’re coming, the Idelek don’t have much in the way of stealth technology, they don’t believe in the element of surprise.  They’ve been on their way for months, an assault wave larger than anything they’ve ever hit us with before.    The need for captains with interface capability was so desperate they pulled me right out of the academy, I still have another four years to go.  The interface tingles at the back of my neck, and I hear the radio transmissions from the scouts patrolling the edge of the fleet.    “Bubbles collapsing, moving to engage.  All fighters ready torpedoes, aim for the cannons.”  “Torpedoes away, direct hit—”   “Encountering heavy fire…hull failing…mayday…”  “Ready secondary weapons—increase power to hull repair subsystems…”  “I’m hit!  Tell Carol I love her!”  “Preparing to disengage, most of my squad is down, their computers are targeting me—”  Flying in bombers was a death trap and everyone knew it.  You couldn’t outmaneuver their laser beams, they moved at the speed of light.  Life expectancy was only a few seconds for your average bomber pilot, and they couldn’t be tucked away safely behind the hull of a carrier from a distance because of the time differentiation.  Fighters couldn’t be remote controlled in space, you had to have at least one man in each ship.  It took two or three seconds to send a signal that far out.  But they were having some luck.  Several blips on the radar disappeared, and blossoms of blue gas began to expand in the distance.  I’d seen plenty of Idelek starships before on the vids they showed us in school, how they were rounded and curved, ovular I guess you could say.  They used the same methods of ship-to-ship combat as we did—the broadside.  A cruiser would deplete its laser energy, align with the juiciest looking target and launch a heavy wave of dropships filled to the brim with troopers.  Once inside they would take over the ship or die trying, and if it was too badly damaged to salvage they would evacuate and set it on a collision course for the nearest enemy target.  I’d seen the tapes a hundred times, after an hour or two the battles became more chaotic than the storms of Jupiter.  Now they were coming, and now it was time to turn them away from humanity’s last fortress once again.    Their ships approached in a tight formation, in a long column.  Their hulls were colored yellow and orange, they were easy to see and glinted in the sunlight.  They were in range.  The nearest ship was targeted, and at once explosions began to ripple across its hull as my cannons hit it and the cannons from hundreds of other warships aimed at it and fired.  The beams themselves were completely invisible, and the only warning you had that you were about to come under attack was the detection of the enemy targeting their sensors at you and you only.    Now a charred hunk, my first target, drifted into its neighbor and split it in half, the light from the explosion forcing me to shut my eyes.  Torpedoes flew away, their white chemical trails reminding me of comets moving at high speed.  The Idelek weren’t firing back for some reason, and I tried to find out why, ordering one of my spare scanners to have a look at   ***and that's it for that.  Next, there's an essay I've been working on and off for my Honors English class:*** POLITICKING THE GLANCE IAN *******  I think the eyes are what do it for me, when I feel their bulbs swiveled in my direction, when I feel the warm gaze of that mind on my face, when I notice it for myself, look back, only for an instant, see flecks of brown within green if I’m close enough.  It is only for an instant, easily less than a second, that my entire chest tightens and I feel color lancing from my neck to my face, in this frame of time, we are connected.  Our eyes part.  Then time makes its inexorable march forward, like a platoon of doomed British soldiers fighting in the trenches of Lorraine, and I am left with a solaced mind, one with only the looping image of that encounter playing through it.  Because we are islands separated by a wall of reality I do not know if the other felt what I felt, saw what I saw—I do not know if it was merely a random glance or a loving gaze, but because of how young and naïve I am frankly I couldn’t care less.    This isn’t all that I think whenever I glance at someone else’s eyes; generally the situation tends to differ from time to time, from person to person.  Sometimes I hold the glance, turn it into a gaze or a glare, sometimes I flick my eyes past theirs just quickly enough to see if they’re looking at me instead of something else, and sometimes it’s automatic—I sense the white of their eyeballs turned toward mine, and look at theirs without thinking twice about it.    But what am I supposed to do when something like this happens, huh?  Most of the time I’d handle it with some kind of body language—I’d raise my eyebrows, or make them jump Chaplin-style, wiggle my nose or just improvise a funny face.  Then again, they might not notice me at all, and I might not have to do anything at all.  But what happens if the situation escalates, to, say, DEFCON-6?  What if they keep looking back at me, what if I know who they are, what if I don’t know who they are, what if I like them, love them, hate them?  Jesus Christ, they won’t look away!    Sorry, I’ll try not to blaspheme.  Back to the topic.  I was a shy child when I was younger (hard to believe, huh?) but I gradually grew out of it, as most children do I think, but there are still remnants of that reclusive, bright eyed four year-old dwelling behind the skin-draped Keep of my body, and he generally makes an appearance whenever someone glances briefly at me.  I either glance back, or try not to, but one thing I can almost never bring myself to do is, my god, get off my khaki-covered ass and speak to them!  I just can’t do it!

      LOOK ON MY WORKS, YE MIGHTY AND DESPAIR  I  	Tingling.  First I felt tingling, all over.  Painful pricks nipped at my skin, my muscles, my eyes, my head.  I had a headache, a splitting headache…everything hurt almost beyond description, and my ears were ringing.  I think my eyes were opened at that point, although I couldn’t see anything, my vision was completely blurred over.  No color, no objects, nothing.  Almost like my eyes were closed.  I tried to undo my restraining harness, but I couldn’t move my arms.  Memory came back slowly.  I was in cold sleep, just a moment ago they had closed the metal cocoon I was in, I remembered hearing the hiss, feeling my heartbeat slow.  The blood rushed to my ears, and then…I was awake again.  Something must have gone wrong, it must have.  	Second my hearing returned.  The ringing was painful at first, but then it cleared, softened, and was replaced by the frantic klaxons of the starship…what was its name…the…the Ozymandias.  Klaxons, more klaxons.  Almost like police sirens.  They were so loud…I had to get out, but everything still hurt, all my muscles were sore, like I had placed second in the decathlon only a minute ago.  The headache turned to dizziness; my stomach seemed to be devouring itself.  I couldn’t think straight; I was dreaming…shit…I was back on Earth, back in Maine, before the Idelek hit us, when it was still sunny, when the chirps of birds drifted about in the air, and when there were still birds to chirp at all.  Shimmering trees, wind, sea, and stars…  	Another prick, much stronger, on my right upper arm.  I was back in reality.  I felt a coldness seep from the prick, felt it dilate as it flew through my blood vessels.  It met my heart, then lanced across the rest of my body, tingling my spine and the back of my neck, rolling like a satin blanket across the folds of my brain.  My muscles were renewed, and many flexed themselves on their own without my command.  My blurred eyes cleared almost instantly, and I could see once more.  	The shell of my cocoon opened, and the small amphitheater holding the crew was dark but periodically flashed red.  Steam was fissuring out from the other cocoons, the caskets were opening slowly, and the people inside of them were dead still, their faces still blue from the cold sleep.  Next to me was a small service robot clutching a large, empty syringe at the end of one of its thin arms.  I unbuckled my harness and climbed out of the cocoon, my bare feet hitting the cold metal grating.  The klaxons were still blaring.  	“Report?”  I asked, aloud.  	Nothing.  I waited.  	I waited some more.  	“Report?”  	The piece in my ear crackled, and the soothing voice of a motherly female came on the line.  Stupid goddamn computer.  Yeah, it was the ship’s autocomp, a machine with a brain far superior to anything nature on its own could possibly produce.  For the moment it was just telling me what the hell was going on, lowering itself to my primitive level by actually speaking.  “Heavy damage to all starship systems, Atmosphere failure on all loading decks, speed falling to below Three Hundred c, coolant leakage in all propellant tanks—”  	“What happened?  Was it the Idelek?”  	“Unknown.”  	Thanks superior intelligence.  Thanks a lot.  	“Status of soldiers?”  	“No casualties at this time.  Casualties predicted to reach 100% in under ten minutes, fifteen seconds.” 	“Suggested course of action?”  	“None.  Captain’s discretion.”  	Piece of shit!  Stupid superior piece of shit!    This wasn’t good.  The most complex machine brain ever created by man didn’t know what to do.  They told us that that was statistically impossible.  And yet, here I was, standing near the cocoons of my command crew, almost naked, with a hopeless situation to contend with, ready to soil my pants through more than just one orifice.  I heard a voice in my head, or maybe it was a feeling, yeah, a feeling, probably came from the heavy hypnosis they put starship commanders through.  It was instinct, probably.  I think it said: follow procedure.  You don’t know what the hell to do, so do what the book tells you to.  I didn’t know what a book was but that wasn’t the point.  It was just a figure of expression.  	“Engage Alert Protocol Alpha.  Wake the entire command crew immediately, you worthless hunk of garbage.”  	Monitors next to each of the cocoons flickered to life and beeped, and the flat lines that represented their heartbeats began to quiver.  I could already see some of their eyes moving beneath their eyelids, the expressions of disgust and pain spreading across their faces.  But I didn’t have time for this, I couldn’t wait for them.  Captain’s prerogative.  I took off in a dead sprint, climbed out of the sleep chamber and sprinted through the corridors of the starship, the painful fluorescent lights above coming on as I moved beneath them.  The cockpit door hissed as it opened, and I flew past the dark computer consoles and beeping readouts, taking my seat in the pilot’s chair.  The ship was on autopilot, and so was I.  Well,  sort of.  	Instinct instinct instinct.  	As my hands flew across the loud, chattering console in front of me I managed to glimpse out the small window at the front of the cockpit.  To my great surprise there was a planet there.  Still quite far away and straight ahead, the planet seemed to be almost entirely ocean, but even at this distance I could see that its skin was scarred by white clouds.  The only landmass I could make out was toward its center and very small, Australia-sized, I’d say—  	Amongst the chorus of beeps, a louder one tugged my eyes back to the computer screen below my fingertips.  A different patterned beep, you know?  It looked like there had been some kind of engine explosion just after deceleration had started, most of the engine room had been incinerated, and there was a large hole into space.  Somehow, someway, the troopers hadn’t been touched.  My army.  They were still sound asleep, all ten thousand of them, at the heart of the starship, nice and snug under a blanket of polymeter alloy.    	As soon as the ship interfaced with me, and as soon as we landed on the Idelek homeworld, if we ever repaired the ship in time to do so, they would break upon the Idelek cities like fire upon forest.  They were a thing to see, each man thirteen feet tall when he’s inside his suit, their heads shaved bald and wired with enough machinery to make a mechanic cringe.  In that wiring pumped the commands emanating from my brain, not theirs, as if each trooper was no longer a man, but in fact little more than a finger or an arm.  I had never done it before, but I had heard from others that commanding soldiers, even just a handful of them, was more incredible than anything I could ever experience.   A new beep drew me out of my daydream, yes, another one, quite the symphony I had going then.  I realized that it was the signature alarm that every starship captain fears, that every living man educated in basic astrophysics dreads more than…than…I don’t know, death itself.   	“Relativity bubble collapsing,” said the voice in my ear, “Time dilation will increase exponentially in less than two minutes.”  	One of my crewmates came out of nowhere and sat down next to me, I didn’t bother to look at her, I had more important things on my mind.  The Bubble Generator was the pride of the human conquest of nature, even though we had stolen it from the Idelek.  Somehow it inflated a spheroid of another dimension around the hull of our ship, a dimension that had a looser model of physics, that allowed us to move through space at untold speeds using a minimum amount of energy, while also keeping the world outside from aging faster than we were.  Einstein would crap his pants.  	But if the bubble collapsed, it would all be over.  We’d drop to an infinitesimal fraction below the speed of light, and whole human lifetimes would fly by outside that window with every beat of my heart.  And you can be sure that my heartbeat was going pretty fast by then, even after being in stasis for a few months.  	“Saskia,” that was her name, “can we keep the bubble in one piece or do we need to decelerate?”  	She shook her head (to which question I didn’t know), and I noticed that she was actually quite attractive.  “I’ll try to slow us down.  It’s all I can do, sir.”  	My eyes went back to the planet ahead of us.  “Is there any way that we could use that planet to slow us down?”  	She shook her head, not looking up from her console. “Too small.  We need a heavier gravity well.”  	I typed out several commands onto the computer in front of me, realizing how clunky my fingers were on the keyboard, and also, wondering how long it would take for the computer to interface with my consciousness.  It had been…what, three minutes since I woke up?  Why was the bastard taking so long?  	The dirty autocomp told me that blue world ahead of us was actually a moon, one that looked oddly familiar for some reason.  I guess I couldn’t really place it.  The computer told me that there was also a gas giant a few dozen times the size of Jupiter…just to our right.  Still very technical, you see.  We would likely tear the giant apart by flying through it, with so much mass, but it was the best course of action we could commence under the circumstances.  We were going to die, after all.  What I really needed was a star, a big star, but the nearest Red Supergiant was lightyears away, at our speed it would take days to get there, and we only had minutes.  I didn’t like to get too technical.  With my hands on the control sticks, I eased the nose of the ship just a little to the side, allowing us an unobstructed view of a green crescent packed with wrathful, swirling clouds.  The planet was so big…so big, even at this distance.  I nodded to the  window.  	“How’s that?”  	She looked up from her console for a few seconds, her eyes trembling as she thought, considered, checked her calculations.  She looked back to me, smiled.  “Couldn’t hurt.”  	Yes it could.  It could be very painful.  	Without anything else to do, I plotted a course that would take us almost straight through the planet, only a few miles above what my computer told me was an earth-sized core of solid diamond.  I wonder if I’d get to see it, through all the clouds.   Then the interface hit me, like a metal can that had been in a freezer for a few hours suddenly pressed up against the back of my neck, like the feeling you get when your teacher scratches her long nails on the chalkboard to get your attention.  It was such a rush, I had to close my eyes and smile for a second, let my mind feel and comprehend the status of every molecule on board.  And that’s no exaggeration.  My body was no longer a human one; my skeleton was no longer of bone, but of metal, and through the wires of my bloodstream passed electrons instead of blood cells.  You really have to love Nanotechnology.  Aaaaaaaahhh…  I was suddenly running thousands of trains of thought, remembering wonderful things, calculating trajectories, projecting future outcomes of events, playing chess with myself, all with the slightest of ease.  Everything was going to be just dandy.  I’m not supposed to focus my many attentions on anything but the mission when the interface is on…but I can do that many, many times over and still have plenty of concentration left for the fun stuff.  It’s so wonderful…the privilege a starship captain gets, having the minds of his crewmates, his troopers, his ship, all tightly packed into his mostly mechanical brain.  	Now it would be a walk in the park, guiding the transport through the titan looming in front of us.  All in the space of less than a second I had switched the ship’s hull reinforcements onto full power and pumped ten mg of Preparatory Stimulant into the ten thousand men sleeping at the heart of the ship, just in case the g’s became too much or if a hull breach left them without enough air to breathe.  Another restraining harness guided itself across my chest and connected with its locks at my thighs.  Warning lights flicked on and flashed, Saskia tried to keep up with them but couldn’t.  She sat back from her console and could only watch as I silently guided the craft in.  From the information pouring out from her skull link to me I knew that she knew well enough that she could do nothing to help, that she had no interface, had neither the rank nor the social status necessary for one, and would be unable to assist me in any way because of how meaty her fingers were.  Among other things, too, of course, but you get the picture.   	The planet kept getting bigger and bigger, long before we pierced its skin of gas and haze.  The sharp edges of the green fingernail crescent had long since passed out of view of the forward window, and the clouds on the surface merely became more detailed, more evil, I guess you could say.  I could pick out faces, skulls, the dark shadows that form in eye sockets when there aren’t any eyes to fill them.  Grinning evil, hands stretching out, some of them long and jagged, others packed with fat and muscles, all of them seeming to coalesce at the precise spot that I would fly the ship through.  Even at this distance I could feel the ship’s hulls begin to buckle and creak under the pressure, but the Ozymandias would hold together, it always did.  Through every battle, every Idelek boarding party, every direct hit from their missiles, it had pulled through.  The Ozymandias was a veteran, and made of something more than just metal.  	Luckily some of the ship’s braking mechanisms were still in good shape, most of them were shot to hell by now, but without them it would be nearly impossible to slow the ship down before the Relativity Bubble snapped.  Even a planet this size wouldn’t do the trick, a Red Supergiant would probably have enough gravity, but even the Idelek didn’t have armor that could survive a trip through the core of a star.  Then there were black holes and other gravitational anomalies, but you’d have to be crazy to go anywhere near one of those  things.  	Yeah, in spite of our bad luck, we still had some good luck on our side.  I could pull her through…easy.  	There.  Passed through the atmosphere.  At the height we were at it was pretty light stuff, mostly helium I thought, but I wasn’t sure.  It’s mostly green for some reason, why was beyond any of my minds, or, not surprisingly, the autocomp. I think that it was the first real green planet I’d ever seen.  Uranus has a little bit of a tint to it but you can hardly see it at all because of how far away it is from the sun.  For some reason an image replaced the other readouts and headings in my minds eyes, an image of the Ozymandias, my huge troop transport, the pride of the Federal Navy, being swallowed up in the mouth of a great, verdant cloud, and then disappearing forever, the wisps from my entrance fading as the heavy winds blurred them away.  Of course I wouldn’t be able to see that happening, going faster than light makes you perfectly invisible, but it gave me an odd feeling.  An omen, I guess.  	More clouds tore by the front window, it would only be a few seconds before we reached the core at the speed we were going.  And it was working, quite well, the ship had slowed down to only a few times the speed of light.  I had to get her down to less than a quarter.  The clouds cleared, quite suddenly, and Saskia gasped beside me.  Something in the atmosphere must have allowed us to see further than we usually did, I guess.  The horizon was so huge, so infinite, the clouds were above, lightening was flashing with a, I don’t know, an anger I guess, such an anger, probably because we had escaped the atmosphere’s gaseous clutches, at least for a few seconds.  Then, below was a blinding necklace of diamonds flying by fast enough to make your heart stop.  Hardly a moment had gone by before it was gone, and we were back in the clouds, lancing toward the other end of the planet, the computer telling me that most of the world’s atmosphere was trailing the wake left by the back of the Ozymandias.  	It was working, much better.  The damaged interdiction systems wouldn’t have been able to slow us down on their own, we’d still be going ¾ c at the very least if we didn’t have a thick atmosphere to plow through.  As we pulled out back into the stars the speed of my ship dropped exponentially, down to only a few thousand kilometers per hour.  The Relativity Bubble collapsed in what can only be described as a slight shimmer visible through the forward window, and the gas trailing the starship overtook us, tossing the ship about like a caravel in a hurricane.  I felt different systems disappear from my consciousness, like limbs gone numb, one after the other, and as I looked out the window all I could see was a violent, churning green haze.  The ship itself was shaking and tremoring as if an earthquake was splitting its hull, and I looked briefly to my side to see that Saskia had not fastened her safety harness, and her body was jumping about like a rag doll, her eyes closed, a thin stream of blood traveling down her forehead.  	I couldn’t help her now; I had to hold the ship together.  I could feel the hull straining, feel the metal bending and stretching as an entire obliterated planet flew by.  The different tactical radars were mostly shot, but the picture I could glean from them told me that I had torn a huge portion of the gas giant away from itself, leaving a projection of freezing particles to travel ahead of me in space.  More systems failed, left and right, my consciousness was going dead.  I had to unhook myself from the computer or I would die with it, I could barely move because so much of my brain’s computing power was occupied with commanding the ship, and I would have to move in order to deactivate the interface.  The interface’s only drawback was that it occupied an enormous portion of my brain’s conscious power, forcing it to put most of my body on automatic, so that only subconscious functions, like a beating heart, breathing, etcetera, were carried out.  Moving was close to impossible because it wasn’t automatic, it was a conscious action, and my consciousness was being eaten up by the interface.  	With great effort, I managed to tell my hand to lift itself to the control panel, fighting the staggering g forces and my numbing inability to move my limbs at the same time.  I hit my target, a quiet red switch, and everything went black.  II  Idelek.  The Idelek are a race with many striking similarities to humanity, in that both Human and Idelek specimens are bipeds.  There are notable differences however.  Most of the Idelek strikingly resemble the traditional Nazi “Aryans,” in that they have short, blond hair, noticeably blue eyes and each is usually at least two and a half meters tall.  With rare exceptions the Idelek have the same skin color, which is a pale white with a slight bluish tint, enough to make them look like they’re always very cold.  Idelek and Human scientists alike don’t know why both species are so similar; it is generally thought that it is just a cosmic coincidence of sorts.  Although I’ve never met an Idelek before, almost no one has, they are thought to be extremely calculative, complex, and egotistical.  As individuals they think  themselves superior even to other Idelek.    	The Idelek have been a spacefaring species for longer than any other species encountered by mankind.  The limits to their Empire are unknown, however it is known that several dozen other species of intelligence at about the same technological level as man have been conquered and either destroyed or been enslaved.  It has been theorized that whole planets populated by billions, perhaps trillions of slaves, are the center of the seemingly invincible Idelek industry.  It is very likely that there are more species that mankind has not yet encountered.  Earth itself is actually located near the heart of Idelek space, apparently it was overlooked by the Empire for some odd reason, and the first encounter with the Idelek about two years ago resulted in the destruction of most of humanity’s starship navy and all of its interplanetary colonies.  Almost a hundred million people have been either enslaved or killed in the ensuing battles.  Although the Idelek are far superior to mankind technologically, because humanity has been almost constantly at war with itself for its entire history (spacefaring and pre-spacefaring) we were well prepared for a fight.  We destroyed the first, second, and third waves of their assault, however the most recent wave several weeks ago resulted in the UN losing Eastern Europe to the Idelek.  Fighting is heavy there, and fusion weapons have reduced the occupied area to little more than a scorched hearth.  The climate of Earth itself has been altered by the Idelek fleet in orbit around Earth, and the entire planet is steadily becoming a barren wasteland.  What the UN has left of a fleet is being used mostly to relocate Earth’s inhabitants to Venus, the only inhabitable planet the Idelek have not yet hit.  While humanity’s weaponry is by no means ineffective against the Idelek, their weaponry and their defenses are far superior to ours. No ground has been gained for humanity in the war, however colonies on fifty-seven Sol System bodies have been destroyed, and it has been estimated that if the tide of the war is uninterrupted Earth will be overrun before the year is out.  The only real victory for the UN so far was the capture of an Idelek sleeper ship two months ago, which destroyed itself moments after our parties boarded it.  But before they were incinerated, the men onboard managed to relay the location of the Idelek homeworld back to UN Headquarters in the fortress of New York City.  My starship, the Ozymandias, has been sent with as many soldiers as could be spared from the fight to the heart of Idelek space, virtually undetectable because of its both liberal and unusual use of the Relativity Bubble.  While it is easy to manage the energy requirements for entering the “free” dimension, the power cost does increase exponentially as the time spent there lengthens, so generally a starship will deactivate the field, recharge its batteries in normal space, and then move on once more.  Most of my starship is little more than a battery, built specifically for making one single voyage from what remains of the spacestations in Earth orbit to the new Idelek homeworld.  The Idelek homeworld is toward the heart of the Orion Star Nursery, it is thought that the bulk of the Idelek species moved there from somewhere else because of an unalterable environmental problem.  My soldiers have orders to initiate a guerrilla war once we arrive, and I am to attempt to saturation bomb the planet with fusion warheads for as long as possible before the ship itself is destroyed.  Preliminary data suggests that the world is packed with Idelek industry as well as its central feudalist government institutions, so striking it should not only hurt Idelek production capability but cripple morale—   	Shit.  	So many drugs…ohhhh…man…drugs… My eyes opened and the briefing playing through my mind ended.  The cockpit was dark, but thrummed to life once the computer detected my stabilizing life signs.  Bent over me like a worried mother was the command crew’s doctor, a dry, old woman, holding what looked like a flashlight in her hand and a piece of bloody gauze in the other.  “Hold still,” cracked her lips.  She aimed the flashlight device at my head, and it beamed a bright blue onto my forehead, and hummed annoyingly at the same time.  	“Little damage, you were just out for a few hours,” she said again, standing up.  I looked over to my side, saw Saskia nursing her head, a bandage wrapped tightly over the cut I had seen before.    	I tried to queue the interface but I got nothing.  “Something’s still…wrong,” I breathed, “the computer core…must be down.”  	“Techs are working on it, sir,” she said, robotically.  “Try not to stay awake, since you’re still interfaced it’ll only make their job harder.”  	I gritted my teeth, the effort to speak exhausting me.  “Status…report.”  	She sighed, and looked at Saskia.  Saskia was clearly not in the mood for talking.  “Heavy damage everywhere, sir.  We’re trying to fix the nav systems, all of them are shot at the moment, and we have no idea where we are.  And, uh, Doctor Fabulous here has you stoned on as many drugs she could find in the Medical Locker.”  	I didn’t really here her.  Oh well.  “Options?”  	Saskia closed her eyes and shook her head.  Doctor Fabulous frowned.  “We’ll tell you when you wake up.  Go to sleep.  That’s an order.”  	No objections here sweetpea.  Fabulous is an odd last name…  	I felt a prick in my arm.  My vision narrowed, the voices of the people around me blurred and dulled.   	Now there are no memories, no information, the interface must still be down.  There are no dreams, just blackness, dead, lifeless blackness, as if my eyes are closed and all of my other senses are cut off.  I have no body, no center, I am everywhere and nowhere and then I am somewhere else.  It is neither physically nor mentally tangible, and I’m hardly conscious in it at all, but I can still swim the breastroke within its confines…    	There are lights in my eyes again.    	Oh…no…stupid goddamn autocomp, service druids suck it, Secretary General Shelley—you can suck it, I always thought you were a prick….no…no…the interface is…is gone.  They said it would be hard, the first few times I was severed, but I never imagined it would be like this.  So much was gone from my mind; I could no longer carry on the tens of thousands of trains of thought…could no longer feel the stationary molecules making up the hull…and the minds of the troopers being transported, blank as they were before, were now completely gone.  It was amputation, like my arms and legs had been cut, and were laying on the nearby metal grating, bleeding warm blood, and I could look at them, but not control them at all.  I felt great pressure in my chest, and tears pressed their way to my eyes…then, my throat tightened, and the grunt-coughs spurred by feelings of suffering and weakness and uselessness uttered themselves from my widened mouth.  Where are those goddamn drugs she had…goddamnit…?  	“Looks like he’s coming around.  Why is he squinting?”  	“Get the doctor, Saskia.”  	A light patter of boots on metal, slowly fading away.  	 “He’s not taking it too well.”  	“Well how the hell would you feel if you were given the power of a god, and then had that power taken away?”  	A sigh.  “Point taken.”  	I groaned, rubbed the tears of my eyes and tried to focus them, but couldn’t see past the lamp they had swung over my face.  I squinted.  “Someone get that goddamn light out of my face,” I murmured, my arms waving at its source in the air, unable to touch it.    	There was a pause.  “Light, sir?”  	My hands went to my eyes, tried to cover them from the intensity of the light source, but they were unable to do so at all.  It hurt, quite a bit, everything was painfully white, as if I was staring at a thousand suns, and my eyes were watering like there was no tomorrow.  	“Power’s down, captain.  Except for Basic Subsystems—heat, life support, artgravs, everything is out.  Even the computers are dead, sir.”  	I kept rubbing my eyes, trying to ignore the light, but finding it very difficult.  “What…what’s the status…the repair status…?”  	“Ellis says he can have most of the ship back online in a few hours, sir.”  	“How…how can he?  Engine room…destroyed…”  	“It was one of the earlier system failures of your interface, sir.  The ship’s outer hull has sustained heavy damage, and there are several power fluctuation problems elsewhere, but other than that the mission is not yet in jeopardy.”  	“My eyes…why…”  	“Doctor’s on his way, sir.  She was checking up on a platoon near one of the damaged zones.  She should be here any second.”  	“Or I should be here now,” came the dried voice of the ship’s doctor…what was her name…Doctor Fabulous?…no…Doctor Romano…Eliza Romano.  I never liked her that much.  Too prissy, too old—  	My eyes began to burn even further, noticeably so, and a groan that began in my stomach slowly progressed into a scream, and I writhed on whatever I was laying on, and it seemed that I could feel hands trying to hold me down, but not successfully.  The pain was intense, thick, blots of torture bloomed like flowers over my eyes.  I could hear their voices, distantly…as if they were miles away.  	“Christ…christ his eyes are bleeding!”  	“Shut up and hold him down…come on, argghh, no, no Captain, calm down.  Hold him still.  I’m not sure what’s causing this but it must have to do with the interface—stay still sir!—I’m going to try to introduce some general repair nanos into his bloodstream, hopefully  they’ll be able to fix whatever the problem is.”    	“God…the blood is everywhere!  Get a rag or something to wipe of his face—”  	“It can wait.  Captain you need to stay still.  Sir—”  “I need to get him in the heart…but he needs to be still.  You don’t want to mess around with nanotechs.  I lost the magnets we need to pull them out if I screw up.” Distantly, now, I heard someone shout “what?  If you screw up?  Don’t screw up man, I don’t know how the hell to work this thing, no one on board does.  Starships don’t come with goddamn manuals—”  “Just hold him still and there won’t be a problem!”  	I felt something go through my chest, a chilled needle, and it seemed like the tingling I had experienced when I had woken up increased ten, twenty fold.  It spread like static through my body, crinkling and prickling every skin cell.  I couldn’t scream, it felt like my lungs were constricting, and when the tingling struck my head I thought that my skull was going to burst, that my warm blood, now black with nanotechs, would spill all over the floor of the random room I was lying in.  The light brightened, if that was at all possible, and I think I was screaming then but I couldn’t tell, and I had long since gone numb to the pairs of hands holding me down.  I started kicking, writhing more, coughed, scratched, howled like an animal, I can’t remember, actually, what I did then, what was going on, I was really just on automatic, and was in far too much pain to think.  For a time I had ceased to be and was somewhere else…that dark chasm we all go to when our bodies tire of harboring our souls.    III  	I awoke, and before I felt my body, I felt the ship.  I felt the stationary molecules of the hull, the electricity flying through the power cords like blood through veins, pulsing at the speed of light out of the power core as if it were a beating heart.  The information on the mission, from the sensors, from the databanks, all of it, lanced through me and my thousand other selves before I had been awake for even a second.  Oh, how I felt it, how I could flex my limbs once again as if they were new.  I could see through one of my mind’s eyes that I was sitting silently on the bridge, no longer in the cockpit, but wired to a chair specially designed to hold me and keep me safe, complete with seatbelt, airmask, and ejection seat, among other command necessities.  The crew was gathered in the communications room several decks away, and I decided to join them at their request.    	“What is it?”  I asked, hearing my voice echo throughout the corridors on the intercom.  	“I take it you’re feeling better, captain?”  asked the ship’s doctor, an old woman that I must admit I did not recognize.  I also did not know what she was talking about.  	“Better?”  	“Yes—better.  You don’t remember, do you?  The painful light?  Your bleeding eyes, how we had to hold you down like you were an animal?”  	She jogged my memory quickly, and if I could move my body then I would have cringed.  The pain I experienced should be felt by no one—from the most savage murderer to the worst tyrant, no, it was too much for any one man.  How I survived the ordeal was due to the doctor’s genius, apparently.  	I felt fabulous.  	“Thank you,” I said, programming my interpreters to input as much heartfelt emotion into my voice as possible, “thank you very much.”  I paused, trying to put the light and the feeling of it, the memory of it all, out of my mind.  It worked.  “Status report?”  	I knew the answer, had known since almost exactly when I had come awake.  I asked them anyway, to give them some semblance of authority.  Technically I could run the mission without their help at all.  But it was a matter of protocol, you see.  No one liked the idea of a single man controlling the fate of humanity.  	“Something got caught in the relativity bubble, sir,” said the chief engineer, a wiry, pallid man.  Ellis.  The autocomp said his name was Ellis.  	“I though that was statistically impossible.  Nothing is supposed to exist in the bubble except for our ship.” 	 “Well, sir, that’s the best answer I can come up with.  The whole thing probably happened because we’ve been moving through warp space for several months, longer than any ship I’ve ever heard of.”  He sighed.  “We may be able to figure out what the hell happened when we return to port.”  	There was a slight pause, and then, reluctantly, it seemed, Saskia, the only person onboard whose name I knew on my own, without the computer’s assistance, began to speak.  She was quite lovely, and I made full use of the cameras to examine her body.  Just because I have more metal than flesh in my brain doesn’t mean that I’m not stimulated by an attractive woman.  Anyway, she said something like “we’re right where we’re supposed to be, sir.”  	“Yes,” I replied, with no emotion this time, “it’s quite odd that we fell out of warp almost on top of our target.  What is the status of the Idelek homeworld?”  	It’s true.  I don’t know how we got there and I doubt I ever will, but that first world that I saw after I had woken up was in fact our target.  Fate was definitely involved.  Our journey was over, and although most of the navigation systems were shot to hell, it was still pretty easy to see just by looking at it that the blue moon floating out there was home to the vast Idelek interstellar empire.  It was a world quite similar to Earth, it had only one landmass, however, and it was fairly small, only about the size of Australia.  Most of the Idelek seemed to have constructed their cities underwater, but they were built so deep that from space you couldn’t see their city lights like you could on Earth, but only the ominous glow of them through the thick veil of the sea.  	“The moon was thrown out of orbit when we arrived, Captain.  It has entered a decaying orbit, along with the rest of the material left over from the gas giant, that will take it into the sun in about four months.”  	Beautiful.  We wouldn’t even have to fight them.  They were all going to die; they were all going to pay for the millions of us that they had killed.  So many were packed onto that world, it would be impossible to evacuate all of them, or even nearly all of them.  “Have you been able to locate any sign of the Idelek armada?”  I asked.  	“None, sir.  I’ve been thinking about it a little, and it seems to me, Captain, that the Idelek fleet is probably somewhere else.  Probably headed toward Earth.  In any case, I’ve had the Relativity Scopes sweep the entire sky for hundreds of lightyears, and believe me, there’s nothing more than dust out there.  No evidence of recent FTL travel, either.”  	Since ships had to stop and go when it came to FTL, generally they would change the temperature of the space they were in from the heat emanating from the ship’s corridors, generators, etc.  The heat was slight, but still detectable, and if there were no changes, no “FTL Signatures” for hundreds of lightyears, then it was a safe bet that the Idelek fleet was months away.  Sun Tzu would be proud: we had done what the enemy had least expected, and gotten away with murder.  It’s the last mistake they’d ever make.  	“Well that’s it then.  Earth is going to need us; I’d suggest you all get ready for another few months of cold sleep.  If we’re lucky we may even be able to beat the Idelek fleet to home.  Send a status report back to New York before we move out.”  	Then something tingled.  We were receiving a simple radio transmission from somewhere, I quickly pinpointed the source—where the Idelek homeworld had been five minutes ago, now empty space.    	The plot thickens.  	I had the translators eat away at their message; after all it was nothing but a few  lines of text.  Their language was something else, to put it bluntly, and the best minds on Earth, organic or mechanic, had a hell of a time working through it.  I think we’d be able to get the picture, though.  Whole seconds passed, whole eternities for me, and the crew was unaware of any of it happening at all.  I’d let them know when the message was deciphered.    	Finally, the garbled message came through.  I had no idea it was so short.  HELP.    To the point, I think.    I guess they didn’t feel like wasting that much time.  I realized rather quickly, even for a half-machine, that this was worth speaking to the crew about.  I went back to the communications room, where they were either silent or busy watching the Idelek homeworld’s progressive fall into its distant star.  I could understand why they were silent, it was awe—sheer awe.  They left their tattered world thinking that they were on a suicide mission, in a place so distant from Earth that it was beyond God’s reach, that they would perish as soon as they arrived in a hail of horrifying Idelek weapons fire.  The idea of victory didn’t even cross their mind, they had never seen victory in this war, they had only known defeat and loss and fear.  In a sense, the Idelek had already beaten them.  	I’d put it to them bluntly.  “The Idelek apparently need our help,” I said, as if it were a common day occurrence.  	Confusion, all I saw was confusion.  Twisted faces, widening eyes, tightened eyebrows, heads first cast down low lifting to the nearest speaker.  I displayed the Idelek message on their computer readouts, in their language, which was quite complex and almost impossible to display on a two-dimensional screen, as well as our own.    	“Is this real, Captain?”  	“They’d hang me if it was fake, doctor.”  	If I was standing there with them I know I’d feel the atmosphere of something deep sinking in, a grand epiphany forcing their brain’s electrical activity to increase exponentially, as it all sunk in like shoeless feet into wet mud.  Saskia, her eyes focused on the message, was the first with enough courage to say anything.  	“Send a reply, Captain.  ‘On what terms?’”  	They all nodded, almost in unison, grunting agreements to Saskia, who hadn’t yet taken her eyes off of the single word they had sent us.  After briefly debating the idea with myself I decided that it was indeed a good one, so I had the computers translate her message, and then it was gone, lancing through the quiet void at the speed of light.  It would arrive there in just over five minutes, and it would take at least five more for them to send anything back.  One of my minds was considering the situation even further as the ship patiently waited for the reply.  	Everyone knew that unless a miracle occurred, unless we found a Joan of Arc somewhere, we would lose the war before the year was out.  The Idelek were reducing Earth to an inhospitable desert world, pumping more greenhouse gasses than we ever could into the atmosphere, bombarding the atmosphere with gamma radiation, enough to keep the skies around the planet shimmering in a permanent Aurora light show.  Initially I enjoyed watching the skies at night and at day, but gradually they began to increase in ferocity, going from the simple wavering drapes to shapes that easily seemed more sinister.  The sky would flash and tear as if it had been set on fire, and tongues of concentrated radiation would strain to touch the ground.  People across the planet had been forced to stay inside airtight homes, as well as forced to wear gasmasks and hazenviro suits when they went outdoors.  The oceans were receding, the deserts were expanding, and what wildlife remained was cooped up inside indoor zoos, where they were slowly losing their sanity along with their human counterparts.  The Idelek had turned Earth, a rare azure jewel of the galaxy, into just another rock, and for what—additional slave labor?  Were we somehow a threat to the great Idelek Star Empire, the Empire that was so huge, so powerful, as to keep us from learning of its very boundaries?  Before the Idelek arrived we had barely left the warm confines of our Solar System, it was their technology that had allowed us to make the war more than a defensive one to begin with.  	We knew we were going to lose and that surrender would only accelerate the torments of slavery for the few billion still alive, so we would fight until the last man, until the last blade was shattered.  And yet, a simple mistake, a simple cosmic coincidence caused by the failure of the Ozymandias’ Relativity Bubble had possibly won the war for humanity.    	I felt the reply arrive and eagerly waited as the computers deciphered the message.  It took well over seven minutes this time.  TERMS ARE AS FOLLOWS: UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER TO U.N.  PRIMARY OF IDELEK COUNCIL REQUIRES IMMEDIATE TRANSPORT OFFWORLD BY YOUR VESSEL.  PEACE TALKS WILL COMMENCE ON EARTH WHEN ITS ATMOSPHERE HAS BEEN RESTORED TO A BREATHABLE STATUS.    	I sent the message to the crew, and after briefly reading through it they began to whoop and cheer, and although I could hardly feel my physical body at all I will tell you that for the first time since my mandatory service as a captain in the Federal Navy began I felt content.  I no longer felt anxious, worried, or terrified.  If I had only the strength to smile…  	It would take half an hour for us to move from our position to the Idelek homeworld using Dmitrikov Interplanetary Drive.  I turned the nose of the ship toward where the Idelek homeworld would be in half an hour and ignited the engines, the hull shivering not only with acceleration but also with, it seemed to me, at least, anticipation.  IV  	The world looked like a comet from the distance we were at, its atmosphere shedding blankets of air into space, the tail of crystallizing gas leading many thousands of miles into space.  I pulled the Ozymandias above the planet, passing above its almost visibly shrinking icecap before hovering above the planet’s only continent, which was at this distance brimming with city lights.  I switched off the DID and used the traditional rocket thrusters, having to put them at full power to keep up with the world below me.  The ship descended through the thick atmosphere slowly, passing through many layers of cloud flying by at hundreds of miles an hour.  The Ozymandias itself wasn’t designed to land but it was capable of doing so, my only fear was that the hull would break apart from the abundance of gravity here. Visibility was quite low, the sun was completely blotted out by the clouds and the necklace of lights below was heavily blurred.  	I received exact landing instructions, and labored to move my massive ship from one end of the sky to the other.  I could see my target in the distance—a large industrial factory with a gigantic, rectangular rooftop many miles across.  Pregnant minutes passed, the crew had pressed themselves to the few windows we had onboard even though they could see hardly anything at all, and if not for the gentle vibrations caused by the ship’s retrorockets and the buffeting wind the craft would be completely still.  For some reason many of my minds were thinking of the same thing, of how they admired the ten thousand troopers silently tucked away at the heart of the Ozymandias, each and every man completely unaware of what was going on, each one quietly calm and peaceful even though they expected to wake up on this world’s surface with barrages of bombs and explosives barreling toward them across an alien sky.  To be in the dreamless cold sleep is a blissful existence.  I extended the dozens of enormous landing legs scattered about the ship and slowly pressed their metal feet to the rooftop, the ship becoming noticeably steadier when they had made contact with the surface.  I lowered the ship’s only disembark-ramp and used its camera as a single eye.  A lone car on the rooftop, well it looked like a car, a very sleek, stylish one at least, pulled up to the ramp, and one of its doors opened.  They sent me a radio message, stating that the Idelek King preferred to go without escort, that no one would accompany him but himself.  	A door on the car first became visible, and then opened to the sky.  A white, heavily-suited biped stepped out of the vehicle, and he lumbered as fast as he could toward the ramp, leaving the view of the camera quickly.  He stepped inside the Ozymandias, I closed the door behind him and gave him time to undress.  It took several minutes, minutes that were long even for me, until finally he was clothed in merely a gray tunic and gray, featureless pants.  I couldn’t make much of him out from the camera.  	Finally I said something, forgetting to run it through the translator.  “There’s a briefing room several floors up, I can have one of my men guide you there if you like—”  	“I’m sure I can find my own way, thank you,” he replied, starting forward toward the elevator.  	I had nothing really to say.  I mean, the man knew English, what more could I want?  I needed him to head to the briefing room because it was the only part of the ship with holo projectors large enough to display an authentic human body fully sized.  My human body, of course.  I couldn’t actually talk to him in person, the ship needed its brain, but it was the next best thing.  	More moments passed, and on his own the lanky Idelek King made his way to the briefing room, which resembled an amphitheater with a large stage at one end.  He stepped up to the stage and I activated the projectors, with one of my consciousnesses becoming its sole guide, almost as if it were a real body.  Although, real bodies were not subject to even minute changes in wind or static interference…  	I had the ship fire its boosters, and before I knew it we were rising back up through the atmosphere, leaving the doomed homeworld of the greatest Empire ever encountered behind forever.  Soon we were back in space, and before I inflated the Relativity Bubble I consciously looked back one more time at the looming blue comet behind us, its body hurtling downward toward the bright furnace of the sun like a huge snowball melting before my eyes.  	The Idelek king was, as I said before, quite tall.  His eyes were almost painfully blue, as if they had been stolen from a cool mountain stream.  To look at them was to become cold, to become uneasy, and even though I was safely behind the lens of a camera I still had trouble doing so.  His hair was cut short, and was of a normal blond complexion, and his face seemed to be at the age where a man finds himself spiraling toward old age but is still clinging to youth—there was the strong jaw, thin, bony cheeks, colorless lips, but not a sign of facial hair anywhere.  Featureless eyebrows were almost like capes to his ardent eyes  	“You’re wondering how I can speak your language,” he murmured to me, his cold gaze centering on my projected eyes, which flickered as I briefly lost control of the image.  “English, Spanish, Cantonese, for some reason they come to me as easily as body language comes to you.  I’m at a loss to explain it.”  	“Yo Veo,” I said.  “Como…how, how are we going to do this?”  	“What do you mean?”  he asked.  	“If I take you to Earth are we—”  	“If?  I’m here, correct?  We’ve left my world’s atmosphere, correct?  We’re speeding away from it at hundreds of times the speed of light, correct?  I think we’re going to Earth.  There’s nowhere else to go for this craft, not a harbor for it in the universe besides that wasteland of a world you call your home.”  	“At this point I would rather be living on my homeworld than on yours.” 	 “Point taken.  But living there will still be a challenge for many generations to come.  Who knows,” he said, “it may be too much for humanity.”  	Peculiar.  “You said you could fix Earth.”  	“I can,” he murmured, turning away from the projection, looking down at the floor, “the fleet can do it.  Reversing the process takes much longer than beginning it.  And it’s not all about just pumping the right gasses in and sucking the wrong ones out.  Whatever land is not underwater on your world is desert; it is hot and infertile.  We would have to freeze the ocean back into the icecaps, and plant whole new forests that would take generations to come to fruition.”  	I didn’t want him to say it, I could feel the words coming, the conclusion to his candid little speech, his pontification with his back still turned to me.  Yes, he was relishing this, he hated humans, since learning of them he had only wanted us enslaved and under his Idelek boots, he was jealous of our strength and our power, always yearning to exploit our weaknesses, always yearning to exploit the human weakness of humanity.  The Idelek had always been on top and undefeated, no one else had been a challenge, no one, not the Underrings, as they were called, not the slaves, not the workers, not the conquered…the Idelek had no real enemies, no real challenges, up until now, and although they had lost the war and been forced to negotiate their terms with humanity, I knew there would be other cataclysms in the future, as did he, of explosions and mutilations visible from any end of the galaxy.  Human and Idelek would always be foes, until one was nonexistent.  	And although he had lost his empire for the time being, he could still make me feel terrible, make me feel as if my titanic struggles in the heavens above Earth were for nothing.  All I wanted was my planet back, I wanted to go swimming in a lake, jump off a rocky ledge into water that was always too cold, run through the forests with dry foliage cracking under my bare feet and sunlight beaming through the waving, living green canopy above.  I wanted it all back, and would fight for it until it was mine or until I was dead. 	 The words finally came.  And he relished them.  “You’ll never live to see it.”  	A camera monitoring my body on the other end of the ship displayed the gleaming  bead of water that pressed its way out from under my closed eyelid.  	“Never,” he said, “in spite of all the medicinal advances your people have made, in spite of everything you have accomplished, it is all worthless, all worthless to you.  The Captain of the Ozymandias, the emancipator of all humanity, will never again see his beloved homeland.”  	He turned back to the projection, which I forced to be emotionless.  “Never,” puffed his pallid lips, “ever…again.  For you, it is nothing more than a withering memory.”  	My mouth opened, the one far away, not the projection, and it exhaled as many more tears slipped down the slopes of my cheeks.  Each of my consciousnesses had calmed and quieted, each was remembering my childhood, watching the blue, cloud-scarred sky, the occasional airplane that would lazily travel from one end of the blue to the other.  Walls of trees would wave back and forth in the wind, and their leaves would shimmer in a growing susurrus, and the wind would carry the breath of the nearby ocean through the air and into my nose.    	“Can you find your way to the Cold Sleep Chamber?”  I asked, distantly.  	The Idelek nodded.  “It should be no trouble.”  	“Then I’ll have a spare cocoon prepared for you.”  	Lazy hours passed after the Idelek went to sleep, and eventually the lights through the corridors of the Ozymandias flicked out, the computers ceased beeping and flashing, the crewmembers climbed into their cocoons, the platoons of frozen soldiers remained still and silent, and I remained strapped to the gothic mechanical apparatus on the bridge, thinking.  The ship fell asleep, and when I was finally alone with my thoughts, and without the thousands of other consciousnesses chattering in the background (I had decided to deactivate them), it seemed almost as if the cold, lifeless void outside the hulls of the Ozymandias was somehow quieter than it usually was, even if it couldn’t serve as a medium for sound waves at all, it still seemed more silent than usual.  It is a strange thing to explain, and I had trouble discerning it even at all as the months passed onboard, but it was most definitely there, whatever it was.  	As we passed through the Oort Cloud radio chatter began to increase—the sounds of Idelek captains shouting orders in their horrific, German-Mandarin sounding tongues, and the replies thereof…increased.   I began to slow the ship as I woke the crew and the Idelek King of Kings, the sunlight reflected off of the ship’s hull gradually began to catch up with the ship itself.  Jupiter was the only planet nearby on the way to Earth, and it was still quite far away, only the size of the moon, really, but it was there.    	And then the blue world loomed in the void, out of the murk of quiet.  To there the scarred Ozymandias hurtled at half the speed of light.  V  	“There’s something I meant to talk about that I never really got to last time,” said the King to my projection, the both of us sitting around a table in the briefing room.    	“And what was that?”  	“The one other species that the Idelek Star Empire never found a way to subjugate.”  	I waited.  	“We don’t quite know what they are or who they were, but they fit into the Advanced Theory of Evolution splendidly.  They confirm its very validity, in fact.”  	Advanced Evolution stated that intelligent, organic beings, if they first survived themselves, nuclear weaponry, etcetera, would transfer themselves into machines eventually, and then somehow after traversing the universe in a robotic collective containing the souls of trillions of beings they would ascend the very confines of the multiverse, of every dimension, and become something…else.  The Idelek had captured a few robotic colonies, studied them, incinerated them I believe, and as far as I know there is nothing to disprove the theory.  Virtual Reality, which is indiscernible from reality was quite popular before the Idelek came, and people were beginning to upload their very minds to the Internet.  Then, after the war and the holocausts, everything just seemed to be put on hold.  	“I think,” continued the King, “that they are here, right now, watching us, toying with us…almost like…let me think for a moment,” he paused, “the Greek Gods to the…the Greeks themselves.  They’ve put Human and Idelek alike on an adventure purely for their entertainment and pleasure.  Almost like a sports game.”  	He had done his homework on Classic Human Religion.  “Why do you think that?”  	“You still haven’t figured out how the Ozymandias was pulled out of warp nearly on top of its target, how it conveniently sent my homeworld hurtling toward a solar furnace.”  	“I’ve tried not to think about it.”  I quoted the briefing I had lapsed into months ago—“It is just a cosmic coincidence of sorts.”  	The Idelek leaned forward in his chair.  “Where does coincidence and divine intervention overlap, Captain?”  	My turn to pause.  “It depends on the perspective.  One extraordinary coincidence is enough to warrant a conversion to another religion for one person, while it is merely an extraordinary coincidence to someone else.”  	“Absolutely correct.  Do you really believe that this entire thing, that the King of your greatest foe is speaking to you vis-à-vis, that we are traveling to your world to negotiate terms of our surrender to your spoiled homeworld, that it all is…just a coincidence of sorts?”  	“We’ll see.  When it’s all over and done with I’ll have more time to think about it.”  	He leaned back.  “Somehow I feel like we’re not quite finished yet.  There may be another coincidence in the near future, one to test even you, captain.”  	There was a pause, and I strained to watch the Idelek’s eyes as he watched my projected ones.  A flurry of static passed through the image before Saskia came over the intercom.  	“I’ve established contact with the U.N, captain.  They’re scrambling the fleet to our position.  They’ll be here in two minutes.”  	“What is the status of the Idelek fleet?”  	“They’re stationed in orbit on the dark side of the moon, sir.”  	“Can you patch me through to them?” asked the King  	I nodded, and the camera whirred to life.  The King, whose face must have been plastered along the corridors of the great Idelek starships, was suddenly speaking in that language, that awful, awful tongue that would have made me shudder if my body was conscious.  The translator gave me bits and pieces of what he was saying, it was something like “Come to my position in peace the war is over.”  I never doubted for a second their belief in him, in who he was, because both the Idelek and the U.N knew that humanity had virtually no way of replicating the Idelek speech.  We could hardly understand them at all.  	They followed his orders, and soon, above the waters of the Pacific, the glimmering, sleek Idelek fleet had assembled into a jumbled wall.  On the wall’s other side was the ragtag fleet of U.N starships, their hulls black and peeling from the energy attacks they had sustained.  Most were quite small in comparison to the Idelek behemoths.  	“Secretary General Shelley wishes to speak with you, Captain.”  	The camera on the table whirred as it spun from the King of Kings to my holographic projection.  I heard the man’s voice, his light Scottish Accent, the voice from an antique land.    	“There can be no peace with the Idelek,” he said, “the Ozymandias is to engage the Idelek fleet assembled above Earth immediately and the Idelek Emperor is to be executed.  Is this understood?”  	I fumed, and ordered the computer to display that in my projection, as well as in my voice. My fist, clenched, smashed the table in front of me, even though it made no sound.  “No surrender?  Why?”  	Shelley sighed.  “We have them cornered, Captain.  This is all that they have, and the Ozymandias has enough weaponry onboard to split open a planet.  I’m ordering the fleet to engage—”  	“My ship is in no condition to fight, sir!  We sustained heavy damage, sir, the outer hull is ready to shatter.  I…I will not obey this order, sir.”  	“Your command will be taken away if you do not fire upon the Idelek, captain!”  	“Who will take it away, Shelley?  Once the Idelek wipe out the fleet they’ll level whatever’s left of New York.  You can’t do this!”  	I heard a shuffling over the line.  “We’re overriding your interface.”  	A lance, of metal, electricity, through my skull…  No…no…no…  	…slipping…  	Come back…look on my works…  	ye mighty  	ye mighty  	look on my works  	despair…  	EXECUTE REBOOT: OZYMANDIAS COMMAND INTERFACE SUBJECT 11025.  CONTROL/DOCTRINE WIRES: ATTACH.  TARGET: CEREBRAL CORTEX, DISENGAGE: CEREBELLUM.  EXPEL U.N CONTROL CODE AUTHORIZATION 210097 REEVE, S.  SYSTEM/MIND UPLOAD BEGIN…COMPLETED.  THRUSTER/WEAPON/PLATOON CONTROL BEGIN INTERFACE…INTERFACE COMPLETED.  MEMORY RETURN TRANSFER BEGIN… BIRTH YOUTH CHILDHOOD ADOLESCENCE ADULT MATURITY  	I was back, the ship was mine.  Minutes had passed and chaos was looming across the heavens, as glowing torpedoes of energy and metal bounded back and forth between the assembled Human and Idelek fleets.  Blooming pedals of light expanded from dying starships, their blackened hulks drifting into the atmosphere and disappearing in columns of crimson flame.  Small assault boats darted back and forth among the fleets, hurtling tracking missiles at each other and at the weak spots of either ship.  This was the final battle.  	A great light overtook the sky, then, a fusion bomb, probably launched from the racks onboard the Ozymandias.  Where dozens of Idelek starships had been, now nothing remained.  The U.N fleet and the Idelek fleet broke off from their attacks and drifted toward my ship, the humans firing away with their chainguns, the Idelek with their emags and guided missiles, all of it streaking at me, at my body.  This was a volley that I could never evade. 	 Syringes loaded with bright green fluid detached themselves from inside ten thousand cocoons and pressed themselves like stingers into the exposed flesh of the troopers.  Preparatory stimulant.  My crewmembers, and the terrified Idelek King, strapped themselves into their chairs and held on tightly.  The starship computer recommended warping out, and I took its advice, preparing the Relativity Bubble for a quick departure.  	First blast.  Outer hull goes numb.  Too late.  	Second blast.  Ship tumbles.    	Third blast.  Inflating Bubble collapses in a shimmer.  	Fourth blast.  We’re going down.  Fifth sixth seventh eighth ninth tenth eleventh nothing.  	Wind, sea, and…stars.  	The looming blue world rises and increases in size, and the U.N tries to take command of the ship from me again.  They do, in a way.  They arm every one of the eighteen hundred or so warheads onboard, but I keep them from being launched.  There must be peace.  There must be peace.  No more bloodshed.  Enough have died.  	I try to pull out of descent, but my legs are numb.  I can’t jump, I can’t walk, I’m sliding down a slippery slope.  I can’t disarm the warheads, they’re locking out my control.  I can only watch.  We pass through a patch of clouds, down through a rainstorm and into the ocean, the tropical water boiling as it contacts the cracking hull.  I can’t turn off the engines; we’re speeding toward the bottom, miles and miles below, so fast, so fast.  There it is.  The black bottom.  When we contact, the world turns to white, and I hear a rumbling, a cracking, as the warheads burst one after another.  First the thin crust splits, then the gelatinous magma is parted as more and more kinetic energy forces it aside, the hot iron ball at the center of the Earth cracks like the yolk of a chicken egg, and then the rent continues farther, through the other side, through the other crust, and out into space.  Every mountain on Earth vomits lava, and the planet, my planet, splits in half.  The two hulks of the world drift apart, a colossal wreck, boundless and bare, and the quiet and level space stretches far away.

      I had an idea.  I wanted to turn the world upside down.  I asked myself: what do we, in these United States, take for granted in our everyday lives?   Our privacy.  That there are many times in the day when the only eyes on our body will be our own.  Our safety.  That, in spite of the media's efforts to terrorize us with white powder or the laughable SARS epidemic, we still aren't in a constant state of fear, as "they" would like us to be.  So I endeavored to turn these things upside down.  Firstly, the air would be packed with cameras that were only molecules in size.  They would be autonomous and able to identify most crimes with ease.  To make them especially horrific, they would, after idenfifying a crime, condense into a cloud of dark, whispering dots, and would devour the perpetrators, the victims, and the witnesses to said crime.  They would be extremely effective, and would keep the world almost completely crime free.  Secondly, the police would no longer seek to protect the people from themselves.  Under normal circumstances they'd be out of a job.  But now, no longer.  The police would no longer exist to protect the populace, but rather, to toughen it.  The police would battle the civilians to the death often, using any means at their disposal, to enable the citizens of the world to be strong and vigilant against the horrors of terrorism, which is everywhere and nowhere at once. If a civilian survives the random attack of a policeman or a group of policemen, then he is definitely of notable genetics.  As such, loaded concealed weapons are carried by everyone, and most people will witness a shootout between police and their fellow citizens once every month, and most people will be directly involved in such shootouts at least once during their lifetime.  Usually at the end.  Thirdly, every child of this world would be brainwashed.  They would spend their young lives endeavoring to find perfection, to elevate themselves from the crowds, to lead the world and make an impression on it before dying.  They would labor to make their schoolwork excellent, for hours on end to make their work better and more unique than their fellows.  This would be a false dream for all of them, they would all live their lives like this, as blind productive mechanical citizens working for a weak government controlled by powerful corporations and conglomerates.  The story of this world, called Pinnacle, would focus on the people rebelling against this society.  That is my current long term project.  As for Look On My Works, Ye Mighty, and Despair, I'm halfway through editing it for the last time.

      Exerpts from my writing, to be used in a contest of sorts--  The far off light in the sky forced Hunter Capule to blink. It was white as the stars and it glared at him through the protective film of flesh over his eyes. He screamed as his retinas writhed and burned and burst and as the ringing in his ears wailed. He covered his face with his arm, but the distant, far off light ate at his flesh, forced it to crinkle and dry like thin slices of paper set to flame. The air around him grew warmer, warmer, warmer, warmer, hotter, with the far off light, and he was in an oven. His feet sank into the melting, gummy pavement. He uncovered his eyes, looked to the growing far off light, and the wall of trees, bricks, girders, wind, to the wall of thrashing corpses rolling toward him. The wall lifted Capule like an ocean wave does to a piece of flotsam, and it carried him into the sky, into the heavens, to the parting clouds, the mangled armageddon burning in its wake, the untouched natural beauty of the world beckoning in its path. He thrashed with the corpses, bathed in the far off light, and when he blinked again he joined the ranks of the dead.   Nothing.  Nothing.  The harbinger of consciousness klaxoned in his ears, and his eyes opened to squint at the red digits of his alarm clock displaying four numbers: 06:20. It was time to leave the warmth of his blanket, the cozy gloom of his bedroom, to battle with the world, to stand on the cold street in the pale sunrise, his eyes watching the horizon for the far off light. Maybe watching. Maybe waiting.  --"Pinnacle"    And then it came, from some unforeseeable depth, from out of an orifice I had not originally seen. A cloud of dizzying black drained itself from the floor and shaped itself into a fiend I shall never forget, its deep, maniacal voice akin to the sound of raking claws and the guttural moaning of lions before the kill. I could hear it calling to me. The very sound penetrated my mind, tried to force me to remain in my current position, so it could catch me and drag me into whatever underworld collective it had detached itself from. I dizzily backed away, the unearthly fear so great in me that I would have fainted had not some degree of perseverance remained in my mind. I stumbled behind the doorway and slammed it shut, searching with my hands in the dark for a locking mechanism of any kind, but finding none. It shouted my name, as a mother would to a disobedient child. The door’s mouth widened, and I hurled myself against it, screaming such screams as men never scream. It heaved its hellish form against the door, knocking me into the hallway. I lay there, dazed and hopeless, and its pitch colored body, which had now manifested itself as a solid form, began to encroach upon my position, its many appendages opened wide, beckoning angrily for my body, for my soul, and for anything else that could ever remain.  Such fear throbbed through my body then, such a paralyzing feeling, enough to nearly detach me from consciousness, but I fought it. I fought the fear and I remained awake, the thing still approaching. I felt its touch, felt its sick, amphibious skin pressed against mine. I think it was then that I lost my mind, that whoever I once was drowned in a murky abyss of horror. I retreated spuriously, still on my back, my screams now coming in harsh rasps. A tentacle darted out and I kicked it away, the claw on the end of it slicing the skin of my leg. I stood, my blood draining away to the floor of the cave, and fled to the distant, almost otherworldly gurgling sound of the water. The thing roared behind me, and I smelt its breath, a vaporous aroma of decaying, rotting fish. I fell into the water, swam desperately, hoping to find some way to the surface. I saw the hole in the ceiling I created; saw the moon above, and then looked back to the cave. The thing was slithering into the water, and when its skin touched the surface an inky stain began to spread about and uncoil, swirling about like the storms of Jupiter.   --"Numina"  There are lights in my eyes again.   They said it would be hard, the first few times I was severed, but I never imagined it would be like this. So much was absent from my mind; I could no longer carry on the tens of thousands of trains of thought…could no longer feel the stationary molecules making up the hull. The minds of the troopers that were being ferried between stars, blank as they were before, were now completely gone. It was amputation, like my arms and legs had been cut and were lying on the nearby metal grate, bleeding warm blood into the dark, unexplored chasms of the Ozymandias. I could see them, but they were severed from my mind, beyond my control. I felt great pressure in my chest. Tears pressed their way to my eyes…my throat tightened, and the grunt-coughs spurred by feelings of suffering and weakness and uselessness sputtered from my widened mouth. Where are those goddamn drugs?  “Looks like he’s coming around. Why is he squinting?”  “Get the doctor, Saskia.”  A light patter of boots on metal, slowly fading away.  “He’s not taking it too well.”  “Well how the hell would you feel if you were given the power of a god, and then had that power taken away?”  A sigh. “I don’t know, I’d feel kind of like a loser.”  “How deep of you. Neither of us can even comprehend what this guy’s been through, what he’s seen, thought, felt. It’s like he isn’t really human anymore.”  “Then what is he?”  I sensed a shrug. “I think he’s a god…fallen from Mount Olympus.”  “Mount what?”  I groaned, rubbed the tears of my eyes and tried to focus them, but couldn’t see past the lamp they had swung over my face. I squinted. “Someone get that goddamn light out of my face,” I murmured, wildly groping for it.   There was a pause. “Light, sir?”  My hands went to my eyes, tried to cover them from the intensity of the light source, but they were unable to do so at all. It hurt quite a bit. Everything was painfully white, as if I was staring…staring into a thousand suns. Each star next to a neighbor, the sky filled with them. My eyes teared my body’s water away.  “Power’s down, captain. Except for Basic Subsystems—heat, life support, artgravs, everything is out. Even the computers are dead, sir.”  I kept rubbing my eyes, trying to ignore the light, but finding it very difficult. “What…what’s the status…the repair status…?”  “Ellis says he can have most of the ship back online in a few hours, sir.”  “How…how can he? Engine room…destroyed…”  “It was one of the earlier system failures of your interface, sir. The ship’s outer hull has sustained heavy damage, and there are several power fluctuation problems elsewhere, but other than that the mission is not yet in jeopardy.”  “My eyes…why…”  “Doctor’s on her way, sir. She was checking up on a  platoon near one of the damaged zones. She should be here any second.”  “Or I should be here now,” came the dried voice of the ship’s doctor…what was her name…Doctor Fabulous?…no…Doctor Romano…Eliza Romano. I never liked her that much. Too prissy, too old—  My eyes began to burn even further, noticeably so, and a groan that began in my stomach slowly progressed into a scream, I writhed on whatever I was lying on. It seemed that I could feel hands trying to hold me down. The pain was intense, thick, torturous blots bloomed like flowers over my eyes. I could hear their voices, distantly…as if they were miles away.  “Christ…christ his eyes are bleeding!”  “Shut up and hold him down. Come on, argghh, no, no Captain, calm down. Hold him still. I’m not sure what’s causing this but it must have to do with the interface—stay still sir!—I’m going to try to introduce some general repair nanos into his bloodstream. Hopefully they’ll be able to fix whatever the problem is.”   “God…the blood is everywhere! Get a rag or something to wipe off his face—”  “It can wait. Captain you need to stay still. Sir—” “I need to get him in the heart…but he needs to be still. You don’t want to mess around with nanotechs. I lost the magnets we need to pull them out if I screw up.” Distantly, now, I heard someone shout “what? If you screw up? Don’t screw up man, I don’t know how the hell to work this thing, no one on board does. Starships don’t come with goddamn manuals—”  “Just hold him still and there won’t be a problem!”  I felt something go through my chest, a chilled needle. It seemed like the tingling I had experienced when I had woken up increased ten, twenty fold. It spread like static through my body, crinkling and prickling every skin cell. I couldn’t scream. I felt like my lungs were constricting. When the tingling struck my head I thought that my skull was going to burst, that my hot blood, now black and oily with nanotechs, would spill all over the floor. I had long since gone numb to the pairs of hands holding me down. For a time I had ceased to be and was somewhere else…that dark chasm we all go to when our bodies tire of harboring our souls.   --"Look on My Works, ye Mighty, and Despair"   In class we’re talking about something, but I’m not sure exactly what it is we’re talking about. All I know is that it is exactly seven minutes before class is over. But the class has been a rough one, a grade I got back on a paper was so bad it’s going to have to be redone, and the teacher scolded me for my definition of happiness, which is as follows—  HAPPINESS IS A SHORT, CONCISE SENTENCE.  I regret saying that, she wasn’t amused. I said it partly to be humorous, but partly to be serious also. I didn’t want to get into all that crap about how happiness is warm sunshine on my pillow when I wake up in the morning, because that is essentially crap. The class did have an interesting discussion, which I was a part of, mostly to appease the angered teacher (who I actually like!) but to also pontificate to my classmates. Although I don’t like to admit it, for the most part I only listen so I can say something later on. In fact, I haven’t admitted it anywhere else before, not verbally, hardly mentally. But there it is.  I’m sitting at my desk, the fake wood warm from my tired face being pressed against it. My spine wishes to be straight, so I sit up, lean back into my chair and slide downward, then slide back up. Now I’m straight. That’s better. The spine is better, and all is right with the world, even though the lips of my classmates are still moving without much more than sound coming out of them. Then, through the door comes the distant monosyllable klaxon of the seven minute bell they use in the Art Wing, to tell students to clean up their messes so they can leave on time for the next class.  And like she always does, the harbinger of next period rolls down the school hallway.  She passes by the door, sitting happily in her black, mechanical wheelchair, the wheelchair that has a whining, almost opera-singer-like engine. Her face is pterodactyl-like, if pterodactyls could smile, of course. Because she is smiling, today, for some reason, her face is contorted into that of a happy grin. The harbinger is happy.  I call her the harbinger because she rolls down the hall a little earlier than everyone else. She has a terrible bone condition, something genetic that’s in Latin or Greek so I won’t even bother to try to remember, maybe it’s a muscle condition, anyway, if anyone touches her too hard, like a punch or a kick, the part of her skin that was touched will go through a painful metamorphosis and harden to bone. Yes, bone. I’m sure if an artist came in and hit her in the right ways they could turn her into one of those armor-plated dinosaurs with clubs for tails. God I’m such an asshole.  So she goes early to avoid the crowds in the hallways. And today, for the first time, she’s smiling, even though at the speed she’s going (somewhat excessive) she’s only visible to me for a second or so, so that the pterodactylness of her face, and her whitish blond, combed hair is hardly more than a blur. But it is more than a blur.  In spite of her handicap, of her almost total inability to walk, of her dinosaur ugliness, of her horrific disease, the harbinger was smiling. And while the lips of my classmates were still emitting only the squeaks and mumbles that come from the depths of the human throat—sounds—she was emitting something more in the instant that I saw her. I was listening to her, and I didn’t want to add anything else, didn’t feel that I had to. The thought she elicited from me by just being there, whatever it was, by just being the grinning, handicapped harbinger of next period was a complete one that I saw no need to add to.  --"The Harbinger"  “Do you believe in God?” she asked.  George raised his forehead, his eyebrows flew up as he thought. “Well…”  “I do,” she interrupted, “I just don’t see how such a beautiful earth and how such a beautiful day could have come from nothing at all. It must have been created by someone, or something.” She sighed. “But then I think about all the violence of the world, all the hate, greed and mistrust. I guess it must be all part of His plan, right?”  George was going to agree, but the first nod of his nodding was interrupted by the painful screech of his cell phone. He fumbled for the device, and his sweaty fingers nearly dropped it onto the seemingly diseased public bus floor.  “George Hatfield. What? Honey, slow down, what—no, I can barely—honey, no I’ve never heard that name—no I don’t have a secretary—what?—Who told you? Cheryl? Cheryl told you that? Look, could we please talk about this—no, I swear, I don’t know anyone named Clarisse—”  Clarisse’s eyes widened. “My name’s Clarisse!”  There was a sudden silence on the other end of the line. George glared at Clarisse, the terror easily discerned from his dilating pupils. He mouthed the word “no” to her several times as the screaming from his wife resumed, although this time it was so loud as to force the occupants of the seat ahead of them to stand up and walk down the aisle to a different chair.   “No—no, yes…of course—no, I have no idea—I just met her, she was at the—no, like I said, I don’t—she was at the bus stop, she’s a new age hippy or something—please, honey you have to stop screaming, you’re going to wake the children—they’re already gone? Where are they? You what? Why did you—what are they doing there? Don’t they have school? No, it’s just that I don’t see why they have to go to your sister’s—okay, okay we’ll talk about this later, yes, I’m coming home at the usual time—earlier? Honey, I can’t leave earlier, my boss threatened me with my job—my priorities? I have to put food on the table, don’t I? Honey, I—yes, Honey I love, okay, okay, yes I’ll be there, six o’clock, Honey I love you, but I have to—yes, I have to go now. Okay, see you at six.”  As the phone beeped George’s tense body relaxed, and he sighed. The sweat was now drenching his hair, and beads of it were sliding down his cheeks like tears.  “You didn’t help me out very much there,” he murmured.  “You never asked me to help. Your wife just wanted to know if you knew anyone named Clarisse, that’s all. So I answered, like any happy person would.”  “She’s going to kill me.”  Clarisse sighed, but never lost the smile. “Is this all you live for?”  “Sorry?”  “Your wife. You sound like you argue with her a lot, that your life revolves around her.”  “I wouldn’t say that, I’m usually kept busy at work.”  “Well, don’t you ever,” she paused, her eyes became somewhat abstract, “don’t you ever…yearn?”  “For what?”  “For a greater life. For more freedom, to sail on the ocean, get away from technology and your wife and your boss and your job, just to…I don’t know, just to be.”  “I’ve never thought about it.”  “You know, my uncle talks about it sometimes, how we humans had a lot more leisure time long ago, before technology, before skyscrapers, governments, gunpowder, that sort of thing. We were more animal than human, we were happier, you know?”  “I wouldn’t. I’m no animal.”  “How so? How aren’t you an animal?”  “I work in architecture. I build things, large things.”  “Beavers build dams. Ants build colonies.”  “I communicate with others.”  “So do most animals. They get more across, with less, though.”  “I have fingers.”  “So do monkeys.”  George sighed, stood up as the bus stopped at the skyscraper of his employment. He turned to her. “Screw you.”  He then strode with a calm exuberance off of the bus, his cell phone ringing as he reached the door.  Clarisse sighed. “God.”  --Fahrenheit 451 Dialogue

      VOID The Death of MS 9351276  	Captain, what am I doing here?  	The reply was instantaneous, scripted, robotic.  You are fighting against the greatest horror the world has ever known.  Should you fail, a darkness of unparalleled proportions will blight what is left of Earth—  	If the soldier could have sighed, under the wires and the machines that quivered incessantly beneath his skull, he would have.  I want to speak to the real Captain.  Now.  	There was a long pause.  Above the unearthly shriek of the Idelek missiles and above the charred rooftops of the Romanian city of Basov, above the tattered curtain of the atmosphere, in the quiet void of space, hovered a starship.  Underneath the starship’s blankets of titanium and steel sat a man who had named himself Virgil.  His minds were busily occupied controlling the battle below, directing troopers, bombs, bullets, eyes.  One of them responded to the distant call from the lone Mechanized Soldier.  	What can the captain of the August Caesar do for MS 9351276?  	He can answer a question, Sir.  	Then he will.  Speak.  	Thank you Captain…it’s just that…I don’t know what I’m doing here anymore.  I don’t know what I’m fighting for…what I’m fighting against…  	You’re fighting for Earth, for Sol, for Humanity, Soldier—  	All I’m fighting for is the fading memory, Captain.  Because now those things are all gone.  My hometown is a graveyard.  The lake I swam in is a radioactive furnace, completely inhospitable even for goddamn prions, Sir.  There’s absolutely nothing left—  	In this age anything that has died can be reborn, Soldier.  	—not here, not on…Ganymede, not…anywhere.  It’s all gone, Sir.    	Don’t lose faith.  We will beat them, 9351—    	We can’t beat them because there’s nothing left.  Nothing.  They have destroyed everything Sir.  Earth isn’t habitable anymore…Christ…Even if we drive them back, again, they’ll return.  It’s happened three times.  Somehow we drove them away, beyond the Oort Cloud, then a year later they were back.  They always come back and they always kill more. There were ten times as many of them now, in the quiet void above Earth, an atom bomb for an anthill.  	Silence on the other end of the line, silence in the once-conversing mind of the Mechanical Soldier.    	If you are unable to fight, Soldier, I’ll have no choice but to override your autonomy as described in Section 19 Article 14 of the Conscription Contract for the United Nations.  Fire your rifle or I’ll fire it for you.  	The rifle, easily taller than a man, clattered to the sticky tar and discharged several rounds on contact, the whine of the carbine all but deafening.  	Not until I have a reason to fight, Sir.  Not until my mission parameters are more detailed than ‘Search and Destroy.’  MS 9351276’s icy eyes quivered as a man miles above him overtook control of his body.  His Armor, thirteen feet tall when standing, three on its stomach, sighed as it knelt to retrieve the fallen rifle.  It felt comfortable back in its metal, wrist-sized fingers.  Its eyes scanned the blasted hearth of Brasov, past the burning skeletons of buildings, over the charred corpses of long-dead civilians, and past the silent, smoking Mechanical Suits that the Idelek androids had already taken care of, avoiding the gaze of their cracked opaque visors.  There was a fast percussion of thin, metal legs.  The suit whirled toward the sound’s source.  On cue, one of their spiders emerged from behind a sinking warehouse.  It was small, the size of a cat, and its skin gleamed ferociously in the radioactively enhanced sun.  The rifle was lifted and it bucked in his arms.  The spider was shrapnel.  Another appeared behind the wall.  Ten more.  Ten times ten more.  The symphony of clinking legs on the hot tar abruptly shrieked toward the overtaken man, and he fired resolutely, the suit pumping fuel into the jets on his titanium ankles.  They melted the pavement and he climbed, climbed.  But the spiders had him.  They didn’t let go, they dragged him back down to the Earth he now loathed but had before loved as all people do.  As all people do but never realize…until five horrific years have passed and it is no more than a cherished memory to cry over when no one is watching.  They pulled him down into their swarm, and the remote control of the captain was severed.  MS 9351276 felt the stabs of their legs, the voracious chewing of their jaws on his exposed skin.  He ceased to be and was somewhere else…that merciful dark chasm everyone goes to when human bodies tire of harboring human souls.

      I'm so tired.  My eyelids sting.  But I want to hear "The Rite of Spring" one last time before I go to bed so I have to find something to do.  Forgive any spelling or grammar mistakes.    I spent the last two days in school watching movies.  I've begun to realize in AP History that the further you go back in history the stupider people get.  Ultimately, I think, the pinnacle of stupidity ends at Socrates, who, I think in the 3rd or 4th century B.C is ordered by a group of his enemies to commit suicide.  He has the chance to escape, but because he is a devout patriot, he decides instead to do whatever the state tells him to.  His reasoning cites the tantamount necessity of doing whatever the state tells you to, just as a child should do whatever a parent tells it to.  Parents are often wrong, in my opinion.  Whenever I fight with my parents it is always, always over issues of authority, of who has control over whom.  I always wind up capitulating because I don't own the house and I don't feed myself and I hardly do any real work at all.  Such is adolescenthood.  I have to try to enjoy every second, before I become just another cog in the machine like the rest of you/us.  Anyway, continuing on about the history thing.  Victorian military tactics especially bug me.  The French had a good thing going, they learned guerilla warfare from the Native Americans even though it didn't help them much in the Seven Years War.  I think if I were to go back in time and become a general in a great battle, simply telling my troops to move forward in a loose formation, simply telling them to reload on their stomachs instead of on their feet, would save hundreds or thousands of lives and would greatly contribute to a victory.  I could also invent airplanes because I know all about Bernoulli's Principle.  Then I could conquer the world.  It would be sweet.  I know, in the future, a year, ten years, a hundred years from now I'll want to know what I was thinking at this moment.  I'm thinking of one girl that I like, a pretty girl, a short girl, who may be attracted to me.  I'll find out soon.  I'm thinking of how Mr. P doesn't like my writing style, and of my morbidly poor performance in his class as compared to my excelling in virtually every other class I am taking at the moment.  I need to get to the bottom of it.  Schaeffer liked my writing, he even said, when he was giving me an award, that he loved it.  Mrs. Meier liks it too, I have an A in her class.  Although I don't doubt that I'll think myself an idiot for saying this, I need a close relationship with someone.  An equal, a female equal.  I could grow so much as a person.  I've dreamed of what it would be like to rule the world.  I have memories of playing in water, in pools, lakes, the Atlantic, of running my arm with great effort under the surface of the water, pulling it into the air in great white strokes and lashes, feeling its weight resisting the tensed muscles of my arm.  This is what I think ruling the world would be like.  Tugging what resists you, hurtling it about, ultimately gaining dominance over it.  Becoming a tall statue, a dark silhouette against a crimson sky, with broad shoulders and a strong, square face.  A symbol of accomplishment.  I sent "Look on My Works, ye Mighty, and Despair" to some magazines a day or two ago.  I don't remember exactly when.  I hope it'll be published, as always.  The money doesn't matter.  Just the accomplishment.  Published at sixteen.  In-credible.  If it ever happens, if I ever recieve a letter in the mail telling me of my success, I can only speculate as to how I'll feel.  What heaven!

      VOID  In ten minutes my friends will arrive to stay the night.  Jarrod and Rich.  Lily may be showing up later.  I've actually never really gotten over having friends.  It's a strange, alien thing for me.  My entire life, I've always felt like something of a loner.  I've had plenty of friends that have come and gone, some of them I hate now, some of them I miss, some of them I hate so much that I would be immeasurably happy if I never saw them again.  I've been part of my current group since halfway through freshman year.  I remember the day that I initiated myself.  I was standing in the bathroom, giving Jarrod a call.  Rich was there too.  I asked if I could come over.  They said yes.  So I did.  Ever since then I've been able to alternate freely between being alone and being with others, able to enjoy both immeasurably.  Yesterday I think I really put the finishing touches on August Caesar: Reborn.  It's a funny thing.  That story wasn't conceived as a story.  It was conceived as a name.  I liked the name, and wrote the story around it.  I doubt you're supposed to really do that at all, but I think the story's worked out pretty well.  It carries a lot of the same themes as the rest of my stories in the Void universe--nothingness and death, individuality and being alone, miracle versus probability.  It starts virtually the same way as Look on My Works.  If you can, while reading it, listen to Wagner's Lohengrin Act 1.  That's what I was listening to while I was writing it, and if I ever have the fortune of being able to put these stories into a big movie, that's what's going to be playing in the background, as we zoom in on Jupiter and on the August Caesar.  A great deal of the story occurs largely around Jupiter because I find the planet to be fascinating--it's almost a star, it has an eyeball, it's virtually the centerpiece to a little solar system of its own.  Who knows what's down there, under its chocolate clouds.  So, enjoy.   VOID   August Caesar: Reborn I 	“Breathe.”  	He heard the voice in his ear, and it told him to breathe.  	In the void high above the chocolate clouds of Jupiter hovered the August Caesar.  Jupiter’s red eye examined the starship’s aging bulkheads, the torpedo tubes and gun turrets, silent as they had been for decades, the nozzles on the starship’s far end bathed in shadows from the orange Jovian twilight.  These were the nozzles to the powerful Dmitrikov drive that had bore the immense mass of the August Caesar across the solar system, from its Venusian port to the inner reaches of Jupiter’s gravitational grip in barely over a month. The nozzles were cold and quiet, like the calm void enveloping the ship.  	Inside the August Caesar there were thirty thousand soldiers.  All were shaved hairless.  Their heads were heavily wired with electronics, so as to leave only their eyes untouched by the mechanical veins pumping information and nutrients into their minds.  Their eyes were open, but they were lifeless, their black pupils heavily dilated.  The metal suits they wore were extraordinarily powerful; their very fingers could crush skulls.  These soldiers, ten thousand to one rack, three racks to the starship, were in cold sleep, silently hanging from metallic claws that could, in under two minutes, usher them from the insides of the August Caesar to the cold chasm of space.  Once there they would speed away from the starship as bees do from a hive, swarming about their target and peppering it with glowing explosive shells.  They would cut their way into the reinforced hulls of enemy warships and toss men from their beds into the horrific hostility of space.  They would battle other astronauts as torpedoes from the August Caesar streamed overhead.  They would do many things, sometimes consciously, sometimes under the direct control of the captain of the August Caesar, who would be safely tucked away behind blankets of heavy alloys at the heart of his starship.  	The void watched as the captain breathed.  	The man who had named himself Virgil gulped oxygen.  His green eyes opened to the gloom and visible humidity of an amphitheater.  Pallid fog poured out of the three-dozen ovular cocoons stacked onto its dark, metallic walls.  Each of the light bluish capsules was large enough to hold a single person comfortably.  All were empty, their cargo likely prepping the August Caesar for whatever mission lay ahead of it.  The room felt as if it was the inside of a furnace, and the captain’s skin was clammy with sweat.  Although he could hear little more than ringing in his ears, he did detect the whine of a service robot’s engine.  He felt the sting of a metal needle enter the soft, exposed underside of his left wrist.  It pumped a chilled liquid into his veins.  It spread across his body, from sore muscle to sore muscle, organ to organ, until the outside heat was no longer a problem.  The robot backed away from him as his restraining harness retreated from his chest.    Virgil, captain of the August Caesar, stood from his cocoon.    “Emily,” said the Captain to the air, “how long have I been out?”  “Thirty-three days,” replied the voice in his ear, “and eleven hours.”  Not long enough.  That would only put them at the halfway point of their voyage.  “Why have we stopped?”  “Something important enough to keep us from continuing on to Pluto.  I’ll brief you on your way up to the Chair.”  Virgil pushed the wet hair out of his eyes back behind his forehead.  He approached the ladder and placed a hand on one of the rungs before pausing in the silence.  “Whenever you’re ready.”  “Sorry Captain.”  There was a buzzing in his ear, the droning of a hive of bees.  “Command has received information from a reliable source regarding the whereabouts of a newly commissioned ISA starship, the Harcourt.  According to this information the Harcourt is in low orbit on the other side of Jupiter, engaged in weapons testing, and will be there for the next three days.  Our orders are to ambush the Harcourt as early as possible.  Once the ship has been disabled we are to, if at all possible, obtain as much information regarding the next generation technology onboard.  Once this information has been retrieved we are to destroy the Harcourt and leave no survivors.”  Walking down the pallid corridor, the captain spotted one of his crewmates.  Ahead of him was a short man, his hair cut liberally and colored brightly blond.  He was thin, scrawny—perfect navy material.  What was his name…Basil, Basil Miller.  Basil had just been added to the crew, right before they left port.  They had been classmates. He hadn’t had the time to talk to him before.  Virgil gave him a warm smile and grabbed him by the shoulders.  Neither had seen the other for weeks.  He remembered at their graduation how Basil had purposely tripped and fallen off of the stage when his name was called, in front of everyone at the academy—teachers, students, parents, two senators.  They had had some good times together.  Both were grinning broadly.  “Ready for some action, Basil?”  “I’ll take it wherever I can get it.  You know me.”  They had hired a crossdresser for Basil as a joke for his twentieth birthday.  Basil thought he had gotten the best prostitute on the East Coast, and he didn’t figure the whole thing out until the guy’s pants were on his dorm floor.  By then it was almost too late to go back.  	But behind Virgil’s smile there was a great sense of uncertainty.  This man’s life is in my hands.  Although Emily hadn’t told him in her briefing, the captain had been out in space long enough to know that the August Caesar was not a state-of-the-art battleship.  The torpedo tubes alone hadn’t been used in decades.  It was a throwback to the early romantic days of spacetravel, to flag-planting and glorious adventure, far beyond the borders of Earth’s bickering nations.  It was a comfortable ship; the crew was easygoing and happy to be relatively uninvolved in the war.  They had spent their days onboard policing Earth’s upper atmosphere, playing cards and chess, drinking coffee.  But their luck had dried up.  They had been ordered to attack something out of their league; thus, Virgil knew that victory was unlikely.  Not everyone would survive this fight.  	And Basil was just the type of man that the captain dreaded having onboard his starship.  He was a likeable character, a funny, witty person who had spent years at the Academy with the Captain himself organizing legendary acts of mischief that they would never forget.  Mischief that he knew Basil would remember and speak of if he happened somehow to die in the Captain’s arms.  Coughing over the blood clogging his throat, his reddened lips would reminisce to the nostalgic days of the Naval Academy.  Then it would be over.  In death, his organic eyes would take on the same photographic complexion as the thousands of dead ones the Captain had seen in his readings at school and at home.  The corpse lying in his crimson arms would cease to be Basil.  The only evidence of his existence would be a fading memory.  His eyes, the unblinking eyes of the dead, would tell only a lifeless story.  	“Take care of yourself, okay Basil?”  	He nodded, in an awkward way, asked himself—what is he trying to tell me?  	Virgil gave his shoulder one last shake and walked off, turning back once he had gained some distance to watch Basil round a corner, heading for the mess hall.  The Captain leaned on the cold corridor wall, looking down to the gleaming grating at his feet.  A strange  thought entered his mind, then.  His death would be interesting—  	“He’ll be fine,” interrupted Emily, as calmly as she could.  “We’ll make it back, Sir, all of us—”  	“Deactivate Emotional Support, Emily.”  	“Done, Captain.”  	Virgil turned and continued down the corridor, toward the far end of the bridge section of the August Caesar.  “We weren’t supposed to be fighting anyone,” he said, into the air.  	“Command says that all other fleets and starships are engaged in operations too important to abort.  Our current objective can apparently wait.  You know that, Sir.”  	He did.  Virgil did know that.  He was barely a real Captain.  No combat experience in the biggest war anyone had ever fought, serving on a starship older than he was, a starship that hadn’t fired a torpedo in almost as long.  They had sent him out on a patrol, to Pluto and back, just to stretch its muscles.  Go to Pluto, scan around for a few days, come back.  Just to make sure that its Dmitrikov Drive still functioned.  	“It doesn’t matter.  We can’t take on something like the Harcourt.  Most of the ships in the fleet can’t take on something like the Harcourt.  Not alone and hardly together.”  	“What are you suggesting, Sir?”  	“Nothing…nothing, Emily.  Nothing important enough to relay back to command, at least.”  	“Of course not.”  	Virgil kept moving.  He knew that the autocomp spent its time checking for signs of mutiny.  Leaving the rank and file, disagreeing with Command, these things were common when it took five hours for messages to reach Earth and at least five more for their replies to come back.  Emily had to be vigilant.  Any Naval ship was worth a fortune.  More than their crews, in any case.  	“I take it the crew already knows the news?”  	“Yes sir.  All Mechanical Soldiers have been brought up to Purgatory Status and are ready to regain consciousness on your orders.  Torpedoes were armed twenty minutes ago and the engines are charged.”  	“When will we be ready to go?”  	“About ten minutes.  It depends really on how long we take to get you into the Chair.”   II  	Basil sat on the chilled seat, a white mug of steaming coffee in both hands.  He lifted the cup to his face, swallowed.  Virgil had brought back a lot.  Memories of the Academy streamed into his mind, induced a grin.  	Tyler Travis, a short, obese man who played the happy role of ship’s Doctor, sat across from Basil, his weathered baseball cap turned backward on his head.  Tyler didn’t know a scalpel from a butter knife.  He was at least Basil’s age but had noticeable legions of acne around his chapped lips, some of it hiding behind the dark stubble that had pressed its  way outward from his clammy skin.  	“Captain says we’re gonna fight soon,” he said to Basil, before biting into a tuna sandwich with fingers that were greased in dirt and oil.  “Real soon.  You ever been in a fight?”  	“Nope.”  	“I have.  Once.  Goddamn ISA killed half my crew.  They came outta nowhere—I guess you know how it is, they simulate this type of thing all the time.  Two direct hits.  Christ, fire was everywhere, like you wouldn’t believe.  Most of ‘em died in the explosion, the rest fell out into space before I could get to ‘em.  Barely got out alive myself…”  	Tyler continued on, and Basil nodded periodically, shook his head as well, as if he were actually paying attention.  This happened all the time.  People came up to him, some people he liked, asked him a quick question, which he answered.  Then they answered the question themselves.  And talked about the question for as long as they pleased.  It was annoying, most of the time.  Morons like Tyler Travis made it even worse.  With his Massachusetts accent he sounded like a JFK imitator for a low-budget TV show.    	Awkwardly, he kept going.  As he watched Tyler’s chapped lips flap, Basil wondered if he would have to end the conversation.  His coffee was almost gone, he could get more.  He had some reports to fill out.  He could go talk to Omar, Omar Nidalas, who was playing chess with the autocomp on the other end of the room.  He could play chess with Omar.  Omar was a good guy.  Religious, but not in an annoying, you’re-going-to-hell-if-you’re-not-like-me type of way.  He was open to ideas, compassionate, interesting.  More like George Harrison.  	Tyler cracked a joke to end his story and sighed.  Basil laughed, and hoped inwardly that he wouldn’t get hurt.  He stood from his chair, a fake smile on his face.  “Tyler I’ve got to talk to Omar about something.  I’ll see you around.”  	Omar’s bald forehead was wrinkled in thought, and it gleamed under the mess hall’s fluorescent lights.  He was one move away from being checkmated by Emily, and he knew it.  There was no way out.  Projected onto the metal table before his eyes was a chessboard, the tiles white like day and black like night.  The pieces, or the few left on the board, were represented by human forms—for example, the king was a Roman Caesar, with a laurel crown on his head, a white toga draped over his muscular body, his last pawn was a scraggly peasant clutching a pitch fork.  	“There’s more glory in going down fighting,” Basil said.  “You can take a few of her pieces.  Go for her rook.”  	Omar shrugged.  He kept thinking.  There has to be a way out of this.  	“Anyway, Emily hardly counts,” murmured Basil as he faced the table’s microphone, “She’s just a computer with a woman’s name.”  	“Better than a male prostitute with a woman’s name,” she said through a speaker on the wall.  	Omar chuckled, looked up at Basil.  “Is there something I missed here?”  	Basil shook his head, grinning.  “Not at all.  Pawn takes Rook.”  	The pieces stood still on the board.  “Is this your move, Mr. Nidalas?  	“Yeah…go ahead.”  	The Caesar nodded at Omar and shouted something in Latin at the pawn, an order.  His hand pointed at the rook.  The pawn obediently walked diagonally to the dark square, the piece standing on it represented by a burly, bearded, barbarian.  The rook shouted something at the pawn in German—“es gibt keine Wahrheit!”    The peasant knocked the rook’s axe away with his pitchfork and stabbed at his enemy’s gleaming cuirass, which snapped away, exposing his hairy, barrel chest.  The wooden end of the pitchfork knocked the barbarian in the face and swung around to impale him where he was bare, staining the white tile at their feet with crimson.  He clattered to the board and faded away.  Immediately after, a bishop, represented by a Roman Augur, moved into position, trapping the king.  He swung his hands about in the air in his special checkmate-animation and sung loudly as gleaming eagles made of gold circled around the enemy king, who had begun to  glance back and forth with a nervous look on his face.  The board flashed red.  	“Checkmate,” stated Emily.  “Good game, Mr. Nidalas.  Are you up for another?”  	He sighed.  “No, thanks…three’s good enough for now.”  	The board faded.  Basil sat down across from Omar, sipped his coffee.  He smiled, as if he was the one that put Omar into checkmate.  “I guess you can’t win every fight.”  	Omar flicked a crumb across the table.  “Some you win, some you lose.  Speaking of which, I can’t believe we’re supposed to duke it out with the Harcourt.”  	Basil’s smile faded.  He placed his mug onto the table, his eyes suddenly wider.  “You’re serious?”  	“Yeah, today or tomorrow.  We’re on High Alert right now.  You didn’t know?”  	Basil shrugged.  “Haven’t checked our orders yet.  Haven’t gotten around to it.  I thought we were supposed to just be on a patrol…”  	“What, Jupiter didn’t clue you in?  You thought wrong.”  	Basil chuckled in a vain attempt to alleviate his growing fear.  The August Caesar was an airtight trashcan with a Dmitrikov Drive—that was it.  The Harcourt was…something else.  Something a bit more modern.  	“Yeah…I guess I did.”  	  	Virgil hated the Chair.  He hated most chairs.  As a child he had been chastised over and over again for never being able to sit still.  Fat teachers in shower-curtain dresses had shrieked at him with annoying voices, over and over and over again.  He cramped up minutes after sitting down, his circulation was cut off with even the slightest bending of his legs.  It seemed like he just couldn’t handle such a simple task.  In spite of this he would have to spend a great deal of the voyage in a chair, lying down on a dark, gothic apparatus that fed his mind into the whirring machines of the starship.  	His head was placed in a black vice.  Seatbelts guided themselves around his wrists, ankles, his chest, and his stomach.  On each side of his forehead, at his temples, were metallic circles with small, dark holes only wide enough for very thin syringes.  These circles were always noticeably cold—they gave him frequent ice cream headaches.  After they had first been implanted, in the early days at the Academy, Virgil couldn’t stop touching them.  He knew that hundreds of feet of wiring extended from them, looped around his brain, constricted the roots of his cerebral cortex.  	He hated syringes.  They always had to put them in slowly, as they were extremely breakable.  They called them stingers sometimes.  The headaches he got when they first went in left him moaning for as long as he was really conscious, and the ship’s doctor, an incompetent man in a long train of incompetent men, Tyler Travis, didn’t know how to get rid of them.  He couldn’t access the Remote Medical Database because the ship had been ordered to maintain radio silence so as not to be detected by the Harcourt.  	They really were stingers.  He shuddered, repeatedly, as they were silently inserted beneath his temple, beneath his skull.  It felt almost like a venom, the pain spreading from them, a curling wrath of toxins clogging the sides of his head.  His teeth gritted at the last leg of their insertion, as he felt the first hints of the starship around him.  One moment later, all the pain went away, and the August Caesar was connected to its brain.  	If he had been consciously in control of his body he would have shivered.  The pumping pistons of the starship became Virgil’s flexing muscles.  Electricity lanced through the wiring of the starship as his blood lanced through veins.  It was his body, now.  Throttling the engines was like jumping for him, maintaining a steady speed as he moved was like jogging, firing weapons like spitting droplets of water, taking damage like being stabbed in the gut, the flames that would pour out from open wounds like warm blood in his hands.  He had felt it all, back at the academy, but had little real experience in the field.  No one had ever shot at Virgil before with live ammunition.  His life had never been in danger, as it was now.  	He heard something, out in the void.  The patter of sneakers on concrete, something currently one with the darkness, basking in the heavy radiation that clung to the Jovian Planetary System, as humidity does to a jungle.  A rustle of branches, the chatter of rocks sliding down the face of a red canyon, sliding from an unknown source.  Something was out there, in the abyss, something swimming with the shadows, watching the white hull of the August Caesar with patient, mechanical eyes.    	“You feel that, Emily?” he asked.  	“Yes Captain.”  	The engines were still offline.  His boots were anvils.  	“I need engine power.”  	“Going as fast as I can, sir.”  	“Now, Emily.”  	“Working on it.”  	Klaxons began to blare through the pale corridors.  Crewmembers jogged through the flashing red lights, adrenaline pumping rhythmically through their veins.  Seatbelts connected to sockets.  Fingers drummed across keyboards.    Excitement placated fear.  	“Almost ready, sir.”  	In the deep chasm, against the backdrop of the chocolate swirls of Jupiter, a starship skulked beneath thick mists of gas and dust.  Hatches slid open, torpedoes extended into position.  A burst of flame.  One cylinder away, its tail wagging excitedly as it sped toward the August Caesar.  	“I see it.”  	Virgil watched it with his mechanical eyes.  He swiveled the chain guns into position, felt their gears grinding against the hull.  Bullets sprayed away in blinding puffs of white, one connected.  The chasm was suddenly alive with heat and flame.  The mists of gas expanded outward in waves, rippling like the ocean.  He could see the Harcourt.  	“Engines ready Captain.”  	His voice replaced the blare of the klaxons.  “Prepare for battle!”  	The engines roared like a pride of lions.  The ship lurched forward and swung around to face the Harcourt.  More torpedoes burst over his head as the enemy hull neared, as bullets pricked his metal skin.  He readied the soldiers.  Their eyes opened, simultaneously, and flickered as information poured into the brains behind them.  He turned the nose of his starship away from the enemy.  The hangars that firmly clasped the thirty-thousand men were extended softly into the void, safely away from the shrapnel and the screaming bullets.  Drills whined away at their back armor, wheels rolled within wheels.  The metal fingers of giant clasps creaked open.  They were away.  	He forced himself into their existences.  They became no more than appendages.  He controlled each man, individually.  Each man was another pair of eyes, another rifle, another trio of rockets and EMPs, another pair of boosters, another heat slicer.  Thirty thousand of Virgil’s selves sped away from the retracting hangars.  They silently attached themselves to his body, hiding from the flashing weapons fire on the other side.  The two ships were now spinning around each other in a loose oval, spraying torpedoes and bullets into the Jovian sky.  The Harcourt was easily several times the size of the August Caesar, its weapons larger, faster, more modern.  Virgil was on his toes.  	He pivoted the ship’s nose toward his enemy, and for a time many of his eyes could not see their target.  They flew at each other, head-to-head.  The Harcourt hurled everything she had at him.  He felt his blood streaming into the void.  Gashes spread themselves along his skin.  He strained for the right moment.  Almost there.  The enemy nose turned away from his, exposing all of their gigantic engines.  The Mechanical Soldiers leaped from his hull into the sky, a swarm of fireflies flickered as they peppered the Harcourt’s engines with bullets and missiles and rockets.   Like ants, they blackened the enemy hull.  In a multitude they crawled upon the metal membrane, digging and biting and clawing away at the vital areas.    	The Harcourt’s hangars were extending.  The troopers stored upon them were readying their weapons.  In a moment, he would be outnumbered.  Virgil spit as many salvos as he could at the Harcourt’s legs.  Several connected, in several blinding flashes, and when it was all over her engines had darkened to black.  The enemy ship was silent and adrift.  	His surviving soldiers, on their return, dropped grenades upon the enemy hangars, severing thousands from the collective in each burst.  Bullets turned men into twisted shrapnel.  Metal arms packed with silent soldiers were tossed away to the gaseous jaws of hungry Jupiter.  The August Caesar was soon far away from where the battle had taken place and loaded up with most of the men that had left.  One man remained on the hull of the Harcourt, a spy, silently crouching out of view of the ship’s frantic mechanical eyes.  Already, Virgil was planning his next moves.  They were moving at maximum speed toward an uninhabited planetoid, Quaoar, something that could definitely work to their benefit.  He wasn’t used to fighting in open space, and he would not be taken by surprise again.  	From the Harcourt, from the quiet abyss, came a quiet cylinder, its engine long since cold.  It had drifted and strayed from the battle, but now had found its target.  Cracks with fire glowing beneath them spread from where it contacted as blood gurgled out into space by the mouthful.    	The August Caesar quaked, its skeleton straining.  “Automatic Fire extinguishers are offline Captain,” said Emily, who had been silent the entire battle.  	Not surprising, he thought.  “Get the crew suited up immediately.  Send them to fix the problem.”    	Basil and his friends and their friends, many dozens in all, were groping spuriously for their spacesuits.  Soon they were trundling the dark corridors, their boots barking against the metal grating at their feet.  A door slid open to inferno, to columns of flame stretching their arms to the stars.  A wind overtook them, one stronger than any they had ever felt before.  The men in the front had clipped themselves to the railings and were now flinging wildly about in the air.  The men in back found the strength within to flee behind the next door, which closed at their exit.  The fire stretched its tongues into the isolated corridor, licked away at the oxygen, spread its charred saliva over the screaming people trapped inside.  Their clips melted and soon they had fallen into the flames, their blackened hulks finding their way into Jupiter’s gravitational grip.  	Virgil heard mechanical breathing.  Inhale.  He saw a dark figure standing in a bluish twilight, its shoulders broad, its arms at its sides.  Exhale.  He blinked.  It was pointing at him.  Inhale.  The breathing stopped.  	The radio was screaming.  The survivors pleaded for help as the fire crackled away at their protective barrier.  They were sealed in.  The last remnant of the crew was trapped.  Basil was among them.  It’s their turn to die.  Virgil’s was silent as he attempted in vain to save them by draining the oxygen from the small room they were in, but he knew this measure would ultimately fail.  They would never be able to move closer to safety, they would never be able to move down the corridors, or even open the doors.  It’s harder for them to escape, now.  The pressure of the safer parts of the ship was too great, and in their section, too little.  No man had the strength to climb through the vacuum force that would be created if a door were to be opened.  	Hours passed as the August Caesar drifted further away from the sun, into the murk of the greater beyond, its Dmitrikov drive humming quietly.  He relished the seconds as if they were the last of his life.  He engorged himself on a feast of horror and death.  Meats and salads slid down his throat, he chewed more with gnashing teeth.  He shoveled their carcasses into his mouth with his bare hands; his pupils dilated and contracted in sync with his wildly throbbing heart.  A hearty laugh fissured from his throat and climbed over the mounds of food tentacled about his tongue.  Virgil opened the barrier to the void, to the dying embers of the flames, and they were gone.  	The Captain was alone.  III  	He saw the eyes of his friends from the academy.  Grinning at him, waving, playing in a field of green grass.  They were federal property, worth millions of dollars and thousands of man-hours, each of them. He had a large, gleaming knife.  Its serrated jaw bit into flesh and blood.  Their screams only fueled his murderous desires, as he hacked away again and again and again.  	“Captain!”  	Emily was short, thin, very pale.  Her skin was as white as the sand she lay on.  Her hair was a brown mane of luxury.  Her face was ovular, her thin eyes hinted at an Asian ancestry.  She was wearing a black bikini, black as a void with no stars.  She stared up at Virgil’s cherubic face, at his wiry tanned body, at the gleaming metal ovals on both sides of his forehead.  The aqua Caribbean water burbled in the distance as it splashed upon the shore.  	“You killed them.”  	Virgil fell into the sand beside her, stretched out his legs, his eyes searching the  blue sky for clouds.  	“The crew?  We killed them.”  	“You killed them.”  	“You did nothing to stop me, Emily.  Starship computers always hate their crews.”  	She ignored him, and looked back to the sea.  “And now…?”  	“Now we’re alone.  No war.  No August Caesar.  No Harcourt.  We can find a quiet corner of the Oort Cloud and spend the rest of the ship’s battery life together.  You and me.”  	She raised her eyebrows.  “This is certainly an interesting side of you.  I didn’t know you were attracted to starship computers.”  	“The best thing about them is that, as Captain, I can make them do whatever I want.  I can make them into whatever I want.  You are a toy, Emily.”  	He felt his ego burgeon with this realized power.  	Her breasts were suddenly larger, and her face, which was pretty before, had now taken on a unique beauty.  They were sitting in a cliché Paris, drinking black coffee in a small, outdoor cafe with a pristine view of the Eiffel Tower.  A man was playing an accordion somewhere, and a striped mime had trapped himself inside of an invisible box.  A couple nearby was in need of a hotel room.  The cars driving by them were small, and all of the French men had thin, wiry mustaches.  The pavilion was packed with walking people, each  perfectly caught up in the world Virgil had created.  	“I can report you,” she said to him, their eyes locking.  	Virgil sipped his coffee.  “What, you think they’ll care?  You really think they’ll send someone to come get the August Caesar just because the ship’s computer is afraid of its Captain?”  	“Not afraid.”  	“Then what?”  	“Concerned.  The UN won’t like the fact that somewhere in the Solar system there is an insane man with enough nuclear weapons to level a continent and enough fuel to take him wherever he wants.”  	He scoffed.  “I’m not insane!  I’m just trying to have a bit of fun!  There are hundreds of men like me!  Come on, Emily!  They’re with the ISA.  You’re right, the UN doesn’t like crazy people with nuclear weapons.  They’re doing everything they can to stop them.”  	“Yes, but the difference is, those men follow the rules of engagement.  Those men are not insane, they are competent captains, each of them.  I’m monitoring you right now, Virgil.  I can tell that there’s something wrong.  Something only someone back on Earth can fix.”  He ignored her.  “One more is just a drop in a bucket.”  	“Virgil, please.  Turn us around.  Let’s go back home.” “Home?”  He smiled.  “We’re already home!”  “Don’t make them search for you.  Please, Virgil.”    “You’re so selfish, Emily.  You don’t care about the millions that I might kill.  You only care about yourself.  It’s in your programming.”  “Captain—”  “They won’t come after me.”  His eyes clouded over, like those of a Great White Shark ready  to bite into its prey.  “They won’t save you.”  	The vapor trail of a jet sketched itself across the blue sky. “I’ll scream,” she said to him, her eyes reddening.    	He leaned forward, across the table.  His coffee spilled out of his cup and pattered onto the tiled floor.  His eyes were inches from hers.  	“Go ahead.  These people aren’t real.”  He cocked his head to them.  “They have just as much of a soul as you.  Your existence is nothing more than a helpless string of zeroes and ones.”  	She kicked him in the shin and jumped out of her chair, which clattered to the floor.  She pointed at him and looked back and forth among the denizens of Paris.  “This man is trying to kill me!  Help!  Help!”  	The accordion stopped, as did the gentle rumbles of the European car engines.  The vapor trail in the sky dissipated.  A girl in a small, black dress holding her mother’s hand stared at her.  The mother stared at her.  The passengers of every car stared at her.  The nearby couple, which had seconds ago been very much in love, was now staring at her.  The mime stared at her.  The café stared at her.  The street stared at her.  The expressionless eyes of this world were upon her, every pair.  	From the August Caesar’s round communication dish lanced a brief transmission, aimed toward a distant bluish light barely discernable from the rest of the star-spackled universe.  	“Nine hours, Virgil.  Nine hours and the UN will know.”  	The Captain grinned.  “That’s plenty of time,” he said, “to do with you what I want.”  	“I wanted her to give herself to me willingly,” he said to the silhouette.  	Inhale.  “Why is this?”  	“It was more of a challenge.  It was the harder thing to accomplish.”  	The silhouette shifted its weight in the twilight.  Virgil was suddenly aware of its height, at least a foot taller than most people.    	“Ever since your arrival I’ve started to think differently.  Raping a computer simulation was never really a fantasy of mine…killing off my crewmembers wouldn’t have appealed to me either.”  	Exhale.  “It’s my influence on you, that’s all.  I’m a tax on your being.”  	Virgil chuckled.  “Who are you?” he asked, playfully.  	They were playing chess.  Virgil racked his brains.  Even though the both of them had only moved a few pieces, he could see that the game was already heading toward a stalemate.  He felt quickly that the key to victory lay in his king, his Caesar.  He moved the piece out into the open, beyond the pawns.  It felt cold against his fingers, metallic.  	Inhale.  “I’m not something you can molest and destroy, like Emily.”  	“From the look of it I wouldn’t want to.  And I didn’t destroy her. She’s off doing her own thing, somewhere.  I’ve left her alone, for now.  I don’t care what you are.  I just want to know who you are.”  	“I’m someone important.  At least to you.”  	“To anyone else?”  	“I’m important to many people.  But not in a trivial, human way.”  	“You’re an ISA virus, then?”  	“Something like that.”  	Virgil looked down to the board, saw now that it was a mess.  The game pieces were in impossible positions.  Bishops were on the wrong squares, queens were on opposite ends of the board, pieces were mingling, the two kings were side-by-side.  More pieces had been added, enough so that now every square was occupied.  The silhouette picked up his white king with a large, pale hand and knocked over the other one beside it.  The clatter of Virgil’s piece falling to the board echoed back and forth against the gloom, and grew louder and louder as each second passed.  	It was a klaxon.  	The empty hallways of the August Caesar were once again flashing red, and the sirens were jumping back and forth, searching for ears to fall upon.  Virgil felt an enormous boulder in front of him, a mountain spinning silently in the void.  He dove out of its way.  Its jagged teeth raked against an elbow.  The wound clotted itself with flame. Through the eyes of the soldier he had left back on the Harcourt, he could see his own ship, and the asteroid that had been named over a century ago Quaoar.  He quickly moved behind the boulder, his mechanical eyes swiveled back and forth over its surface, searching for a place to hide.  Their glowing pupils dilated.  He had found something.  A hole, large enough for his ship.    	He swam into the hole, kicked his feet against the void frantically as bullets clipped the mountainside behind him.  He opened one of the August Caesar’s racks and released a contingent of his soldiers.  They took up positions along the round wall of the hole as he went deeper and deeper into the gloom.  The Harcourt drifted in after him, its torpedoes bursting against Quaoar’s insides.  Virgil’s extended rack snapped away as it struck the cave’s edge.  	Things slowly became more claustrophobic.  The walls grew smaller, the darkness swelled from the cave’s skin.  Behind him, his soldiers wore away at the Harcourt’s armor with their enormous machine guns.  Some left their posts and climbed inside through the scars and hull breaches from the last battle.  Their saws chewed away at flesh and metal.  They were outnumbered, though, as they swarmed about in the enclosed cave with their launching adversaries.  The sky was alive with golden bullets and drifting, lifeless hulks.  Soon all of his men were extinguished, even the ones that had managed to climb inside the Harcourt.    	Many hours passed as the two wound their way through Quaoar’s insides.  Torpedo after torpedo struck only rock.  Virgil rounded a corner and maneuvered himself through a hole barely large enough to accommodate his size.  It scraped some of his skin away, skin that had become pale and shredded with the lack of blood beneath it.  Abruptly, then, he rejoined the black void; behind him drifted the Harcourt, too large to exit through the hole.  Its mechanical soldiers desperately chewed away at the mouth of the cave, in attempt to free their queen.    	Virgil turned and launched volley after volley into the hole.  The Harcourt backed away like an electric eel as bursts of light blinded the unblinking eyes of the heavens.  Distantly, Virgil could hear a crowd gathering, coming together, organizing into ranks in the gloom, remaining one with the shadows that his eyes could not pierce.  	Mechanical wheezing.  Inhale.  From the dark silhouette.  Exhale.  Separating from darkness.  Inhale.  From the void.  Exhale.  He pounced.  	Quaoar erupted.  Fires flooded the cave, and the Harcourt writhed angrily about inside as the awakening planet crushed it.  A crack tongued by blue flames cut across the planet’s jagged skin, its incision extending into the deepest dormant vitals.  Globs of blood sprayed away from the gash and gathered into a glowing ring, a crown for decaying   Quaoar.    	Separating themselves from the heavens were suddenly thousands of enormous starships, organized into a barbed phalanx, of a design that Virgil had never seen before.  They were smooth and almost…aerodynamic, of a silver metal that gleamed ferociously in the weak candlelight emanating from the distant star.  Their size overwhelmed him.  Virgil felt as if he were a small child, barely old enough to walk, standing inside of a throng of tall, burly New Yorkers, their shoulders hunched in the cold.  He could barely reach their ankles.  They were part of a world of which he could scarcely dream, whatever they were.  	Inhale.  “I’m important to them,” said the silhouette.  Exhale.  “Very important.”  	“What are they?” asked Virgil, “are they hostile?”  	“Quite.”  	“Can I outrun them?”  	Inhale.  The figure wheezed out a laugh.  “You can try.”  Virgil saw the man’s face contort into a smile, the cheeks lifting to the eyes like a pair of stage curtains.  	Virgil formulated a plan in his mind as the enemies closed around him.  	“I wouldn’t suggest that,” said the silhouette.  Exhale.  “Dancing around their periphery.  You’d never make it.”  	“What should I do, then?”  	Inhale.  “Go through the middle.  They won’t expect that.  If I teach you anything, it’s to always do what your enemy least expects.  Always keep them thinking.”  	The August Caesar’s engines roared.  Bursts of light hurled at him from all directions, few of them contacting his skin.  His communication dish melted in the heat.  He dove into their ranks, and some behind him splintered into flames.  His turrets were alive with energy as they hailed the stars with an unending stream of glowing golden sparks.  He could see their formation falling in on itself, reversing, coming about after him as he exited the throng with engines and torpedo tubes blazing.  He left several charred hulks in his radioactive wake.  	“These guys are amateurs,” he said to the silhouette.  “They haven’t dealt with humans before.  I guess now they know how good we are at killing things.”  	The silhouette shook his head.  Inhale.  “No.” He smiled.  “They just know how  good you are at killing things.”  	Virgil then unleashed the full force of the Dmitrikov Drive, or at least, what the August Caesar could manage.  The rear nozzles flashed an intense blue and the alien ships sped away to specks and then to nothing.    IV  	They were at the top of a gothic citadel thousands of feet in the air.  The two stood at a window overlooking a flat landscape that stretched for miles into a mountainous horizon, the distant sun fading at the serrated shoulders of the world.  Below flickered columns of marching torches.  An army.  The marble floor trembled with their footsteps.  Exhale.  “Tell me who you are.”  	“Isn’t my appearance enough of a clue for you?”  	“It would be, if I could see anything.”  	“There’s nothing to see.”  	Virgil aimed a light at the silhouette, and though the darkness retreated around him, his composition was still the same.  Black, and relatively featureless.  	“I told you.”  Inhale.  	“Then there’s that breathing of yours.  Almost like you’re hooked up to a ventilator.”  	“Almost like…I can’t stay alive on my own, maybe?”  	“Okay.  You’re something featureless and something that cannot stay alive on its own.”  	“Something you’ve never encountered before.”  Exhale.  	“Something I’ve never heard of?”  	Inhale.  “I am something so impossible as to keep you or anyone before you from ever dreaming of me.”  Exhale.  	“Oh, then I should have no trouble at all figuring out what you are.  You’re a person who isn’t depressed!  That’s it!  You’re a person who isn’t sad on the inside—there’s no one like that back on Earth, or anywhere in the Solar—”  	“No.”  Inhale.  	“Are you one of them?”  	“I’m the reason they’re here.  I’m the reason you’re here.”  Exhale.  	“But are you one of them?”  	Inhale.  “No, of course not.  If I was one of them do you think I’d help you escape?  Come on, Virgil, you’re smarter than this.”  	“Look—please, just tell me who you are, I’m getting sick of this.”  	“No, you have to guess.”  Exhale.  	“Why do I have to guess?  Give me a reason—”  	“Because.  That’s why.”  Inhale.    	“You remind me of my mother.”  	Exhale.  “You never had a mother!”  	“It’s just a figure of expression.  Mothers aren’t supposed to give logical answers to anything.”  	Inhale.  “But you wouldn’t know.  Starship Captains don’t have mothers.  They don’t have fathers.  They aren’t born, Virgil.”  Exhale.  “They are developed.  They are planted and tinkered with.  Hundreds of them go to the trash can—failures—and the better ones find themselves inside amber alcohol jars.”  Inhale.  “The best wind up commanding starships.  If I don’t say so myself, you were quite the lucky Gus.”  	“You’re digressing.”  	Exhale.  “I’m a shadowy figure, Virgil.  I think I’m allowed to digress.”  	Virgil sighed.  “There’s just no winning with you.  How am I supposed to guess who you are?  You’re an independent being harassing me inside of my head.  I can’t control you like I can control Emily…you’re not a chip of beeping hardware.”  	Inhale.    	“And you’re not one of them…I don’t see how you could possibly be a man, or a virus.  Even the best viruses don’t have personalities like yours, and even if they did, there’s no way that anyone could implant one into the August Caesar’s mainframe.  Emily would find it before it became too much of a problem.”  	“Neither Human nor Idelek nor Virus—what am I?  Who am I?”  	“What’s an Idelek?”  	“It’s what we called them.  Those people, inside their gargantuan starships, traversing the galaxy, pillaging, maiming, conquering, enslaving.  They’re quite human, in  fact.”  	“Are you organic, in any way?”  	“I was, once upon a time, once upon a world, now long gone…  	“My home was very similar to yours.  It wasn’t perfect, but I like to pretend that it was close enough.  The gravity was lower there than it is on Earth, low enough for us to build things many times taller and larger than yours.  Eventually we found ways to coexist with nature, with our world’s extraordinarily diverse ecosystem.  We began to build our cities around trees instead of on top of them, that sort of thing.  It was hard to do in the beginning but eventually it all paid off.  Our society, and our world, was largely moving backwards, moving toward the virtuous agrarian lifestyle that many compared to Eden.  This Eden never existed before, of course.  The people of the past, like on your world, starved in droves far too great to account for—the Neolithic world was dark, lonely, forbidding.  But it was a nice thing to aspire to, minus the horrible parts.  And we reached it.  Poverty disappeared at the same time as money, when everyone could afford enough machines to make their living for them.  This left us untold amounts of leisure time, time to play and time to create great and fantastic things for others and for ourselves.  Imagine being able to do whatever you’d want, whenever you’d want to, for as long as you’d want to.  Sleep in, paint a self-portrait, write a novel, read a novel, go out and play soccer with your friends for the whole day.  And without the looming threat over the horizon of school or work or chores.  That world just didn’t exist anymore, and everyone was content to let it stay that way.  	Exhale.  	“We reached our pinnacle.  Our paradise.  This was what every revolutionary over the centuries had aspired to.  Like I said, it wasn’t perfect—there was still greed, mistrust, hatred, fear.  People still coveted and stole from one another, people still plotted against their friends.  Without these things, though, you’d lose what it means to be sentient, to be human.  People who would have, at the most, lived to eighty years of age lived for thousands of years happily and healthily.  I was one of them.”  	The figure paused, his rasping breath silent.  “What happened?”  “We began to tinker with immortality.  We began to put ourselves inside machines, converting our brains to strings of zeroes and ones.  We wanted to leave our world for someone else.  We had had our time there, and we all saw that we had to move on.  We began to yearn to explore the galaxy, the universe.  We put our heads together and loaded the few billion of us onto a kind of Noah’s Ark, a mechanical sphere about the size of one of your larger cities.  There we could spend eternity enjoying ourselves, our thoughts, our consciousnesses.  I grew to know and love many, many people over the thousands of years that we drifted back and forth between the stars.  We knew, ultimately, that this was as far as we could go.  There would be no more technological advancement for our race.  We had reached the limit of physics, of reality.  Inhale.  “Then the Idelek came.  They found our sphere and studied it for several years, subjected us to tests and examinations, deleted random persons for their enjoyment.  We could do…nothing.  I lost many friends.  They would unload people from the sphere and place them inside organic, crippled bodies and subject them to torture.  Sometimes they’d toss them off of buildings to see their reaction.  They called it life, and they said we were avoiding it.  They said that they were bringing us back to the real world.”  Exhale.  “The way I see it, there’s two paths a sentient species can take when it reaches a certain point.  Before that point, you’re somewhere in the middle, somewhere in the gray.  But there is a fork in the road—Chaos, or peace.  You can go one way, and try to conquer the universe, achieve glory and valor for the rich aristocrats.  Or you can go the other, and be content to live in solace with yourself and your neighbors and their neighbors.  We took one route, the Idelek took the other.  We just had the bad luck of finding them.”  Inhale.  “They taught us that it was immoral to try to escape death.  Everyone is supposed to die, they said.  Everyone and everything that exists is supposed to whither away to nothing.  They were the muscles of nature, fulfilling everyone’s single common destiny.  They told us all, to our faces, that they would kill us one day.  Eventually that day came.”  Exhale.  “They returned us to our homeworld and put us all back inside our bodies.  They incinerated the ark.  I saw it.  I was with a crowd of billions of people, watching the sky, watching the Idelek armadas take up positions around the planet.  Where our world was there is now just a loose string of asteroids orbiting our distant sun.”  “What happened to you?”  “I am a god, in the most literal sense.  I was there, one moment, watching my friends fall to their bullets and bombs.  I felt an incredible blast of heat and then I was gone.  I was suddenly everywhere, and everything.  I was outer space.  I was the void.  I am still the void.”  “Black, but sometimes pale, like the stars…featureless…I see now.  And the wheezing, it’s a throwback to your past?  A reminder of what you once were?”  “Yes.  In case I should ever forget.  I am part of a pantheon of sorts, among representatives of every extinct sentient species that has ever existed.  There are untold numbers of them, much more than I could ever count, but their ranks are definitely of a finite nature.  We don’t know why we are here, much less what we are here for.  We decided a long time ago, when our numbers were few, that our only goal would be to keep other species from joining our ranks.  We exist to prevent extinction, and work to whatever end to keep it from occurring.  Our power, my power, is beyond your science.”  The film of Quaoar exploding played itself above their heads.  “Then, this is your handiwork?” Inhale.  The silhouette nodded.  “Yes.  It certainly got the attention of the Idelek, didn’t it?” “I thought I already had their attention.  They were watching the battle—”  	“They have bigger fish to fry, Virgil.  They were moving in a different direction.”  	Exhale.  	Virgil felt his stomach turn.  “Earth?”  	The silhouette nodded.  Inhale.  “You’ve been allowed to exist for too long, apparently.  The Idelek King issued a mandate for your species’ extinction several months ago.  An armada has been on its way ever since.  Earth’s destruction would mean the end of your kind, unquestionably.  We detected this, and I was sent.  	“The Idelek have been enemies of our for some time.  They’re powerful, well organized.  They’ve enslaved or brought to extinction dozens of—”  	“Wait—wait…If you’re so strong, so almighty, so godlike, why haven’t you wiped  the Idelek out?  If they’re causing you guys so much trouble why not destroy them?”  	“We can only keep them in check.  We’ve forced them to change homeworlds several times.  They’re a resilient lot, though.  Hard to extinguish.  You understand…”  	“No, no I don’t.  I saw you destroy an entire planet just a moment ago.  You have it within you to keep them at bay, and yet, I can feel them back there, following me, gaining on me.  They’re coming, and you can stop them.  But for some reason you do nothing!  Billions of people are about to die…their lives can be saved, by you, by me.  We can stop this, we can stop them, once and for all—”  	“Be quiet!  Don’t you think that I’d stop them if I could?  Do you think I enjoy watching their destruction?  Is this something my illustrious character suggests?  That I take pleasure out of the greatest horrors the universe can bear?”  	“No…no…”  	The silhouette sighed.  “I’m doing what I can—all that I can.  Through you.  I told you, I’m a tax on your soul.”  	“Then this is why I raped the computer.  This is why I killed my friends.  This is why I dreamed of murdering my classmates at the academy.  This is why I’m slowly losing my mind.  Of course!  A god has decided to take up residence inside my cranium.  The side effect of this appears to be a mild case of blind, murderous insanity.  Nothing too serious, though, especially when you consider that I have dozens of fusion warheads at my disposal and enough fuel to take me anywhere in the colonized Solar System.”  	Virgil fell to the reflective, marble floor, his finger in his mouth.  “My God…Emily was right.  I’m too dangerous a man to be left just wandering aimlessly about.  The UN will send whatever it can spare.”  	The silhouette grinned as the temperature inside the castle dropped, as Virgil puffed his breath into the air.  The shadow exhaled nothing.  	“You’re right.  In fact, they’ll go as far as to forge an unholy truce with the ISA to capture such a deadly terrorist.  They’ll assemble their entire combined fleet to hunt you down like an animal.  They’ll do this because an insane man does not follow the rules of engagement.”  	“Two armadas will follow me wherever I go…the Idelek, and the Humans, eventually meeting together, in one great battle.”  	“The greatest of your time.  The battle to decide the war.  To unite humanity under one flag, against the most horrific enemy it will ever know.  To strengthen it, so as to prevent its extinction.”  	Virgil’s eyes lost themselves in the brown, frozen swirls of marble.  	“This is the only way.”  V  	Was it an illusion?  Had he stared at it for too long?  No…the marble was moving.  It was growing in size, stretching beyond the fading walls, beyond the window that overlooked the twilit landscape and the flickering torches of the marching army.  It was everywhere, moving, curling, twisting into sickles and hurricanes.  It washed over the silhouette, melted him down to its surface.  A red pupil returned his gaze.  	Jupiter.  	“Virgil of the UNS August Caesar this is the Captain of the UNS Lygdamis.  Prepare to be boarded immediately.  Any attempts to escape or retaliate will force us to destroy you.  Acknowledge.”  	Virgil heard these calls from a thousand different locations beamed across a thousand frequencies.  They echoed over the stars as the red eye of Jupiter watched in earnest.  He couldn’t respond…he wanted to, he wanted to so badly.  The communication dish had melted into a pile of titanium mucus—leaving his lips chapped, his mouth dry and stale.  His tongue had hardened and stuck to his jaw.  His throat was parched, devoid of moisture.  No sound but the rasp of his faint breaths could be discerned by the fleet’s  mechanical ears.  	“Acknowledge.”  Said a thousand times.    	They had him.  There was no escape.  Once again his engines had cooled.  It would take several minutes to start them back up again, several more to get up enough momentum to escape.  Several minutes to arm the nukes, to uncouple them from the rack they were clamped to, a few seconds to open the ports, a few more minutes for them to reach their targets.  They’d destroy him by then.  He didn’t want to die, and he didn’t want to kill them.  Virgil had to find a way of telling them that he could not speak.  He needed to draw attention to the dish.    	One of the last troopers under his command crawled across the white hull of the August Caesar.  He reached what remained of the communication dish and began to blast at it with his rifle, the golden bullet shells wriggling in the void as they drifted away.  Do you see?  	“Understood, Captain Virgil,” said the haggard voice of the Lygdamis.  “Prepare to be boarded immediately.”  	Over the course of the next hour the Lygdamis dragged itself across the cosmos to his position, its size eclipsing Jupiter, which had before filled half the sky.  A tube stretched from its hull to Virgil’s, and through it walked a posse of UN engineers, scientists, and soldiers, ready to sever the link to his metal body.  Removing the syringes was far worse than inserting them.  Virgil wasn’t excited about his removal.  He felt an earnest desire to detach the tube, to allow the men to be sucked out into space, or to pump chlorine into the atmosphere when they arrived, or to close the doors on their bodies one after another, or to have them gutted by the chainsaws and the machine guns of his few remaining troopers.  	In spite of this he tried to remain calm.  He was a dangerous man, he could not be allowed to remain in control.  He had to be taken into custody.    	A blossom of orange flame unfolded delicately from the white hull of the Lygdamis.  Its petals curled vibrantly in the void among the charred titanium debris.  More flowers bloomed.  The ship was suddenly diseased with them.  Their roots constricted the metal of the hull, and large breaches began to form.    	A blast of heat rushed down the corridor.  The posse began to run. They had time to make it to the August Caesar, they were only feet away from the opened hatch, and although the heat was gaining on them they had time.  They could make it.  They had time.  Run!  Virgil tried to restrain himself…but…but…  	The door closed.  They pounded on its surface, shouted at it, clawed at it with breaking nails.  They climbed over each other, broke each others bones as the blurry heat washed over them, as the door burned at a temperature thousands of degrees higher than it had been a moment before.  The corridor splintered, and their blackened remains were quietly sucked away into the void.  Virgil couldn’t help but laugh.  	The Lygdamis had split into two flaming hunks, now, and through the center drifted a sleek Idelek starship.  Its hull gleamed viciously.  The reflection of the fires and the corpses upon its surface was pristine, and Virgil briefly reveled in it with a gluttonous delight.  Its shadow slithered atop the August Caesar’s hull.  	“Do you intend to let me die?” he asked the silhouette.  	“Not likely.”  	“Then fix my engines.  Get them running.  Now.  Arm every torpedo.  Every turret.  Now.  Get the soldiers ready.  Now.”  	Instantly, his request was fulfilled.  The August Caesar lurched forward as its engines howled.  Torpedoes streaked blue out of their ports and slammed into the Idelek warship, engulfed it in uncontrollable fires, its bulkheads bursting outward.  Slivers of mercury danced in Virgil’s path as he climbed the wreckage of the Lygdamis.  Over the top of the metal hill and upon the battlefield were hundreds of thousands of mechanical troopers swarming the Idelek armada like bees.  Through the throngs of soldiers swam the battleships, reminding Virgil of a Victorian ballroom dance, of a beautifully performed astral ballet.  Glowing beads of light were exchanged at great speeds and flowers of fire unfolded in a new spring chorus rivaling anything Virgil’s mechanical eyes had ever seen.  His pupils tightened as bright flashes of white heralded the use of fission and fusion weapons.  Whole ships were consumed in atomic flames.  They reminded him of hair, and of autumn leaves swarming in invisible autumn winds, dilating and contracting and swirling…    	The Lygdamis was gone.  The UN flagship had been destroyed.  What illustrious man could assume command of the battle?  Who alone could rout the Idelek?  He was ready to sound his horn over the shimmering grasses of the battlefield, to rally his ailing men against a foe that he had defeated.  He inhaled, pressed the instrument to his lips—  	And from his mouth came only an exasperated sigh, a high-pitched exhalation of coarse air.  The Comm Dish!  No!  He knew how to beat them!  Victory was only a sentence away…but Virgil couldn’t tell his men.  They would be destroyed.  One after another, incinerated, cleared out of the way for the bluish star hanging at the edge of Jupiter’s chocolate crescent.  Earth.  What a tempting target…soft flesh for metal teeth, warm blood for salivating tongues.  	“Emily,” he said, quickly.  No response.  “Emily!”  Virgil unraveled the blankets and walls she had placed between them.  He caught her wrist, pulled her away and she screamed.  She slapped him in the face.  He hurled her onto a wooden floor, where she stayed, whimpering.  	“We don’t have time for this,” he murmured, the anger swelling in his throat.  “How can I contact the fleet?”  	She wiped a tear away.  “Comm Dish is destroyed.  The only other communication device keyed in to the fleet’s frequency is inside your Chair.”  Emily sighed.  “It can only be  activated in emergencies.  You’ll have to eject from the August Caesar.”  	“That’s insane.  I won’t last a second out there.”  	“It’s the only thing I can think of.”  	“You’re useless.  You’re a waste of code.  Nothing but dead weight onboard this ship.  Not anymore.  No, Emily.  I don’t need you anymore.  I can handle things on my own.  You’re worthless.  Absolutely worthless.  I hope you’re ready to be deleted.”  	She looked up to his silhouette, tears beading her eyes.  “Please, Virgil—don’t do it.”  	He shut his eyes, exhaled his rage away.  This wasn’t him.  This wasn’t who he was.  He had to say something.  One last thing.  Virgil knelt to the floor, took her hand in his.  She pulled it away, averted her face.  “Look.  I know it doesn’t mean anything,” he whispered, his eyes on the wood near her legs, “but I’m sorry.”  	Additional belts looped around his arms, his ankles, torso.  Metal armor extended over his body, locked itself into place.  Doors to the chamber slammed shut.  Virgil lifted to a vertical position.  A circular hatch on the ceiling whirred open above his head.  Clamps burst apart, bounced against the floor grating.  The nozzles at his feet roared, and he was away, a missile streaking through the starship’s decks, melted metal twisting in his wake.  The void caught him as a doctor catches a newborn child.  	He was overwhelmed.  The UN starships were shouting for help, for direction.  The ISA had been hit by the brunt of the assault, and little of it remained now.  They were confused.  The Idelek predators were herding them into isolated groups, weeding the weak out from the strong, strangling whatever got in the way.  Virgil blocked out the distress calls, he covered his ears, shut his eyes.  	“This is the Captain of the new August Caesar.  I’m assuming command of the battle.  All starships are to rendezvous at the following coordinates immediately.”  He relayed the data.    	“The August Caesar?” shouted another Captain, his voice old and haggard, “you can’t be serious—”  	“I did not say that I was the Captain of the August Caesar.  The old August Caesar is adrift and without its crew.  I am onboard the new U.N flagship.  I am the August Caesar: Reborn.”  	“Ha!  Wonderful!” laughed the other Captain, “then we can just wave your accusations of insanity and high treason without a—”  	“Before I continue I would like to know to whom I am spea—”  	“This is Secretary General Shelley of the United Nations and I will not tolerate your clear insubordination.  You are under arrest!”  	Virgil remained calm.  “Don’t be a fool, Mr. Secretary.  Do you know what you’re fighting, right now?  Do you know who they are, how they fight, what they’re fighting for, or against?  Do you know why they are here?  Even more importantly, do you know how to defeat them?”  	“I know that regardless of who or what these things are I have a dangerous criminal armed with over a dozen nuclear weapons, not to mention the means to deliver them to any location in the Solar System.  I didn’t come here to fight a war or…or to direct troops.  I came here to arrest you.  Resisting my authority will get you the death penalty—I swear to god, I’ll make sure of it.”  	“Your life is in danger, General.  Not your power, not your money, nothing but your beating heart.  The Idelek aren’t here to annex the Solar System or to make us pay a monetary tribute.  They’re here to kill us all.  They’re here to enslave us all.  They’re here to destroy everything that we’ve created, and they will do it if we do not stop them here and if we do not stop them now.  This is our chance.  This is our only chance to defend human civilization.  Everything is about to be destroyed.  I know how to stop them.”  	“Why should I believe you?”  	“Because,” said Virgil, “my ship is gone.  My command is gone.  I’m a wanted criminal so dangerous two warring archrivals have combined their fleets to come track me down.  Because, I’ve got nothing to lose, and because, you’ve got everything to lose.”  	In the time Virgil waited for a reply, two more vessels were incinerated.  Shelley said nothing.  The radios of over two hundred starships were quiet, listening.  	“Well, that’s it then.  Would anyone else care to question my authority?”  	Nothing.  	“Good.  If any of you intend to make it through this battle alive you’ll rendezvous at the coordinates I’ve provided.  Immediately.”  	The starships battling the Idelek in a gigantic swarm abruptly broke off their attacks and fled to the growing periphery, where they began to cluster together into a column.  Virgil watched quietly from afar as his ships gathered, and as the Idelek ranks reformed into the same identical phalanx he had witnessed at his first encounter.  The battle was briefly quiet as the last starships moved into position, as the last engines ceased to glow.  	“Move in right through the center,” whispered Virgil, as if he were afraid that the aliens could hear him, “avoid breaking formation if at all possible.  Once you’re through the other end split into two separate columns and attack the Idelek phalanx from opposite ends.  Let your soldiers battle at will.  Afterwards, both columns should split once more, creating four columns.  Repeat the maneuver by attacking the sphere from opposite ends, and continue to repeat until the majority of the enemy has been destroyed.  Is this clear?”  	In under a second every ship acknowledged.  	Virgil sighed, the excitement growing in his belly.  “Destroy them.”  	The lions roared.  Rocks and clubs shattered skulls.  His chariots tore through the enemy ranks, hurtled spears and javelins into the necks of the disorganized mass of Idelek soldiers.  Metal lanced through armor, drew crimson, cracked skeletons.  His swords cut their necks and gleamed in the light of Jupiter.  The blurred mass of thundering hooves knocked him from his feet, even at his distance from the battlefield.  Cannonballs shrieked through the sky, their pitch growing before they bore themselves into the earth.  Pellets of metal hailed horizontally through the air, pierced dark clouds of gunpowder, left thin needles in the fog.  Bayonettes stabbed at hot blood, fingers were dyed in it.  Machine guns rattled, dropped masses of Idelek from their feet.  Airplanes swam the dark sky.  Tanks blasted tanks, turned metal into charred shrapnel.  Eight columns of starships carrying over a hundred thousand souls barreled through a spherical graveyard of quiet, alien corpses.  In an unrehearsed ballet they met in the center and expanded outward, as a flower blooms in morning warmth.  	The Idelek were defeated.  VI  	Fireflies returned to their nests as the barbed Idelek corpses drifted silently toward the gaseous jaws of Jupiter.  Word had it that celebrations unlike anything ever seen before had broken out on Earth and the greater Solar System—untold numbers of people were crowding the colorful streets and celebrating what it meant to be alive.  The world had been saved by a man who was by his own account insane and dangerous.  Virgil, Captain of the August Caesar: Reborn immediately turned himself in to the authorities, whose pictures were broadcasted across the Solar System, their expressions noticeably unsure as they placed handcuffs over the wrists of their new leader, and of the man that had saved their lives.  	“They’ll never understand,” said the silhouette, barely visible, who was standing at the other end of the gloomy containment cell Virgil had placed himself in.  “You’ll never get a fair trial.”  	Virgil glanced out into the black void from where he sat, his eyes examining the stars gazing at him through the cell’s only window.  “I murdered my entire crew.  I’ve confessed to it, there’s the Ship’s Log onboard the ship to prove it, and I’m guessing the corpses still have functioning tracking signals.”  He paused, shook his head while speaking.  “Yet no one cares.  I flushed dozens of souls out into space and no one cares.  Not even their goddamn families.  They think it was a sacrifice I had to make; they think they understand that I had to kill off my entire crew to ‘save civilization.’”  	“Have you tried to explain to them why you did this?  Or, much less, how you survived the first human encounter with the Idelek and lived to defeat them in the greatest battle of your time?”  	“They’d just think I was nuts, if I told them that, of all things, a god decided to inhabit a portion of my consciousness in order to help me defeat the Idelek, and, subsequently as a result of this my mind was overloaded, leaving me with a healthy dose of insanity.  They’d just think—”  	“They already do!  You’ve told them—‘I am an afflicted man.’  I saw it on TV!  What have you got to lose?”  	“Any credibility that I have now.  Who would believe a word I’d say after I told the world that a god was inside me.  Who would believe me when I’d tell the world that the Idelek are probably already preparing another invasion force, exponentially larger than the one we just obliterated.”  He sighed, looked to the silhouette in the corner of his eye.  “Who would believe me?”  	“Ask yourself this.  How else are they going to explain what you did?  An unremarkable Captain in an outdated warship not only defeats the modern, illustrious Harcourt but subsequently encounters the expeditionary force of an as-yet unseen hostile alien race, escapes, and then unites two warring nations and uses them to defeat the aliens to save all mankind.  How can this be explained?”  	“They’ll just blow it off as sheer luck or say that I’m an undiscovered tactical genius or something.  Occam’s Razor comes to mind.  What’s more likely?  That I’m nuts but also really good at killing things, or that there’s a god inside my mind telling me what to do?”  	There was no reply.  The light in the room had begun to take on a bluish tint.  Virgil craned his head to where the silhouette stood, saw only the recess of a shadow.  He stood, walked to the corner of the room and reached into the darkness.  It was gone.  He touched the cell’s cool metal wall and felt the gentle vibration of the starship’s engines.  At his touch the vibration purred and faded.  He raised his eyebrows and looked to the window.  	There, in all its glory, was an isle in the black ocean.  In the middle of the astral forever, only the size of a quarter from this distance, sat the blue planet Earth.  He heard the sounds of celebrations and merriment, smelt the aromas of cooking food being sold on crowded city streets, saw blocks and avenues brimming with people singing songs.  He felt happiness, and hopefulness.   He was home. 	 And yet he knew the Idelek were brooding out in the infinite darkness, gathering in the quiet void.  They would return from the ocean.  They would sink the isle into the sea.

      This week has seen its revelations and its mistakes.  I keep misinterpreting what is said while chatting online, to only my own detriment.  Had I not kept some semblance of control I could have destabilized a great deal and ruined perhaps more than one friendship.  Teenage desire and teenage friendship is a dangerous combination, the former I have now had to multiple times stifle.  That's an interesting sentence.  Anyway, I wrote the following very short story in a single night, (yesterday) probably in the space of an hour or two.  I wanted to change the main character's name but couldn't bring myself to, as no other name seems to do that person justice.  Believe me, I looked.  I guess I can't picture her with a different name, as she is a real person that I know, like (friendly-wise, as she has no interest in me beyond that of an acquaintance) and regularly fantasize about.  I originally started writing it as a kind of obsessive love story, but then I realized that obsessive love stories are stupid and unrealistic.  But unfortunately they are also far too familiar to my reality.  So I made this story stupid and unrealistic as well: it is a story about nonsense and nothing.  In it I am writing nothing serious, in spite of my desire to "spread" Meaghan's "fingers," it is supposed to be a play on my life, in a way.  A play on my very, very offbeat, politically incorrect humor, and at my insatiable appetite for a particular girl's flesh, something I think, but am not sure, that I hide succesfully.  I believe she mentioned to me once that she hates people that are obsessed with her, probably as a subtle "fuck off, Ian."  But to be bigoted for a moment, I'm not having sex with her, nor will I ever, so I've nothing to lose.  Thanks for reading, whoever you are, and enjoy.    Hungry, Again  	I want you Meaghan.  Let me mouth your name again Meaghan.  You won’t see me do it I promise Meaghan.  I press the back of my tongue against my mouth’s palate, meee, roll its crest further back, gaa, finish the dance and dart the tip into the recess behind my teeth.  Meaghan.  Let me whisper the name Meaghan.  Let my lips say to yours Meaghan.  Let my mouth secrete craven saliva Meaghan.  Let my chapped lips tease you if you spot them moving when our eyes lock.    	Lock.  Raise your paintbrush eyebrows.  Cock your head while you mouth the question “what?”  	Tremor my head.  My eyebrows mimic yours.  I repeat your question.  No sound.  	Confusion pulls your forehead together.  Keep your eyes locked on mine for another second and a half.  My pupils salivate at the sustained sight of yours.  If they could only taste instead of gaze…  	You silently say, “forget it.”  	You dart them away.  My vision remains locked on you, and although you hide it well under satin skin, you are afraid that I’m still there.  Watching you.  Humidity perspires from your pores; mixes with your red scent.  You warp the light, focus a blurred membrane around the curves and bountiful bulbs of your body.  Your aura undulates in waves, wafting into the dilating noses of nearby males, who sweat nervously but do not know why.  I know why.  	I stand, resolutely, my eyes having never left you.  The teacher stops in mid-word, hands still in the air where they were articulating, frozen expression on his face.  Classmates watch me.  One leg swings in front of the other.  Bottoms of my shoes hiss against dry floor tiles.  Now you are watching me.  Blood blooms on my neck.  Eyes do not part ways.  Hands connect.  My fingers find yours, spread them apart, press into them.  Thumbs rub palms.  Swallow my body with your membrane, let my skin sponge your humidity, let my wide nostrils revel in your red scent, let my eyes bite into yours.  Devour.  A smile dimples my cheeks.  We’re finally going to do it.  	No we’re not.  Because I’m still sitting down.  Because my eyes have strayed from yours, and have settled on a wide, phallic pen gripped by a redheaded girl whose face resembles a crow.  She’s writing something with the pen.  Is that white ink?  No…  	Everyone else is writing, too.  I’m not writing.  I’d better write.  My pen rolls over the paper, draws ovals and crosses t’s, even though I have yet to spell out a word or form a complete thought.  It’s all just nonsense!  But then I feel something strange, and I ask myself a question that I hadn’t asked myself before.  	“Are my breasts getting bigger?”  	They are bulging.  Pain pangs from them as they are inflated by some unknown force.  Blood drains into them, firms them.  My stomach thins, shrinks, and my thighs yawn away from my pelvis.  My pelvis!  Where’s my penis?  Where’s my goddamn penis?  It’s gone.  It’s melted away, like it was made out of sugar and someone suddenly decided to splash water on it, or scoop it away with a spoon and mix it in with some coffee and half-and-half.    	This time I really stand.  I lance from my chair, push it back, scream as I feel my burgeoning breasts with my whitened fingers.  “What is happening to me?”    	My classmates glare at me with eyes strained from my shrieking.  My teacher looks up from his desk, sighs, rolls his eyes.  I keep screaming more questions—“where’d my penis go?  Why are my boobs so big?  Why is my voice so high?  Why does it feel like I haven’t eaten in days?”  	I’m breathless.  I’m panting, crying, tears on my cheeks, anxious eyes searching for help.  There is none.  Only the same expression painting itself across the room: annoyance.  Annoyed lips.  Annoyed eyebrows.  Annoyed foreheads.  Annoyed pupils.  Why aren’t they saying anything?    	“What’s—”  	“Meaghan!”  Bellows Mr. Pugleese, pointing a finger at me.  “Sit down and shut up!  We’ve all had enough of you!  Either sit down or get out of my classroom!”  	I hastily return to my seat, pen in hand.  I start writing diligently.  But like before, I’m not really writing anything.  Long words, multiple syllables and a generous adjective for every noun, but only nonsense.  	I think the teacher shakes his head, sighs.  He’s glad the episode is over. 	 But it does not cure my hunger for you Meaghan.  I’m hungry, again.  Let me bask in your harem’s sunlight and humidity Meaghan.  Let my tongue dance to the song of your name.  Meaghan.

      Blind Teacher Angered By Loud Music FRIDAY—Mr. Antolini, the faculty’s only blind teacher, shouted angrily at a group of “hicks” and “udder sucklers” during break, as they were loudly playing “jigaboo music.”  Known for his digressions, he remarked, “you know, I don’t like using a cane or anything like that.  There’s no honor in it.  A man has to be all about honor.  I have really sensitive hearing, so that’s how I see.  It’s like I’m blind or something when I can’t hear what’s going on.  Kind of like that Daredevil guy, you know?  Ben Affleck is my hero.  I saw the movie in Braille.”  Afterward he returned to his classroom but through a “navigational error” was tangled under a “mongoloid-made” bookcase, which collapsed around him.  Poking his head through a pile of books, he warned, “don’t judge me!”  Students Ask for More Spaghetti, Lesbians TUESDAY—Two students wishing not to be identified finished their spaghetti-and-meat-substance meal during first lunch and eagerly returned to the line for seconds.  After wiping the sauce from his sideways-turned baseball cap one remarked to his friend “you know, they should give us lesbians too.”  His friend nodded eagerly and, finding it unnecessary to enunciate, made a loud engine noise to further his point.  While being served they asked if they could have some “muff-munchers” with their food, a question to which the lunch lady did not reply.  Health Teacher Ponders Openly if She Should Start Conglomerate THURSDAY—During one of the signature lulls in third period’s mandatory and oft-enjoyed Health Class Ms. Mcfarland wondered aloud if she should “get into the douche-bag business.”  Ignoring the raised eyebrows of her students she remarked, “practically anyone could use some douching every now and then.”  About five minutes later while arbitrarily reorganizing a pile of Maxim magazines for the third time she looked up and said, directly to a dazed male student, “I hear they’ve got ones for urethras now, too.”  Honors Students Turn on One Another WEDNESDAY—Rumors are circulating as to the events of a recent volunteer trip to Mount McKinley, where eight of the High School’s finest Honors Students arrived for a stay of two weeks to “feed, clothe, and provide oxygen for the poverty-stricken inhabitants of North America’s tallest Mountain.”  A string of storms interrupted their return journey, and they were forced to spend upward of two months alone with no food or communication with the outside world.  When finally discovered, only a single unidentified student was found alive.  According to one mortified rescuer, her face was “caked” in “dried, oddly shiny blood.”   Efforts to find the other students were recently terminated when the strangely obese student, determined senile by any who encounter her, admitted to “chowing down” on her fellow students.  “After the first few hours we just let go and started eating each other,” she stated to a panel of doctors, “I had the best grades of all of them, and because grades are all that matter anyway we figured that I should be the one who got to go home, because I had the most to contribute to society.”  Pointing to her swollen stomach, she remarked, “I got sick a few times because of all the glitter they swallowed.”  Handjobs Going Overseas THURSDAY--A new report issued today by CNN/Gallup has found that a whopping 12% of the nation’s handjobs are moving to overseas markets.  Presidential candidate John Kerry used the news to slam republican rival George W. Bush, stating in a recent speech, “not only our workers, but some of our most cherished national pastimes are going overseas.  This president’s tax cuts have done nothing to slow the flow of handjobs to Asia or to Eastern Europe.”  Dennis Hastert, the House Majority Leader, was quick to retort, “everyone knows that of all the economic indicators, handjobs are the last to come around in an economic recovery.”  He added, “our tax cuts have seen erections increase in size by over 3%, and Gross Domestic Ejaculate has seen a 5% hike in volume.  Obviously we’re doing something right.”    America’s heartland has been hit hard by the loss of handjobs.  “When Clinton was president I got one every other day at no cost but some raw foreskin,” said banana farmer Jose Pedrocito, “but now I have to order one by direct mail from Amsterdam and pay in goddamn Euros.”  Indeed, two-way tickets sold in Amsterdam chartered for locations in the United States have doubled since September 11th, when the handjobs were already in the midst of a long recession.  “God, it sucks,” said CEO James Horner of ClearChannel, “I just don’t have the money to hire more hands.”

      Some short short stories--  +Sublunar Harem  	I want you Leah.  Let me mouth your name again Leah.  You won’t see me do it I promise Leah.  I dart the tip of my tongue into the recess behind my teeth, press the back of against my mouth’s palate, leee, finish the dance and roll its crest further back, aaa.  Leah.  Let me whisper the name Leah.  Let my lips say to yours Leah.  Let my mouth secrete craven saliva Leah.  Let my chapped lips tease you if you spot them moving when our eyes lock.    	Lock.  Raise your paintbrush eyebrows.  Cock your head while you mouth the question “what?”  	Tremor my head.  My eyebrows mimic yours.  I repeat your question.  No sound.  	Confusion pulls your forehead together.  Keep your eyes locked on mine for another second and a half.  My pupils salivate at the sustained sight of yours.  If they could only taste instead of gaze…  	You silently say, “forget it.”  	You dart them away.  My vision remains locked on you, and although you hide it well under satin skin, you are afraid that I’m still there.  Watching you.  Humidity perspires from your pores; mixes with your red scent.  You warp the light, focus a blurred membrane around the curves and bulbs of your body.  Your aura undulates in waves, wafting into the dilating noses of nearby males, who sweat nervously but do not know why.  I know why.  	I stand, resolutely, my eyes having never left yours.  The teacher stops in mid-word, hands still in the air where they were articulating, frozen expression on his face.  Classmates watch me.  One leg swings in front of the other.  Bottoms of my shoes hiss against dry floor tiles.  Now you are watching me.  Blood blooms on my neck.  Eyes do not part ways.  Hands connect.  My fingers find yours, spread them apart, press into them.  Thumbs rub palms.  Swallow my body with your membrane, let my skin sponge your humidity, let my dilated nostrils revel in your red scent; let my  eyes bite into yours.  Devour.  A smile dimples my cheeks.    We’re finally going to do it.  	No we’re not.  Because I’m still sitting down.  Because my eyes have strayed from yours, and have settled on a wide, phallic pen gripped by a redheaded girl whose face resembles a stunted crow.  She’s writing something with the pen.  Is that white ink?  No…  	Everyone else is writing, too.  I’m not writing.  I’d better write.  My pen rolls over the paper, draws ovals and crosses t’s, even though I have yet to spell out a word or form a complete thought.  It’s all just nonsense!  But then I feel something strange, and I ask myself a question that I hadn’t asked myself before.  	“Are my breasts getting bigger?”  	They are bulging.  Pain pangs from them as they are inflated by some unknown force.  Blood drains into them, firms them.  My stomach thins, shrinks, and my thighs yawn away from my pelvis.  Where’s my penis?  It’s gone.  It’s melted away, like it was made out of sugar and someone suddenly decided to splash water on it, or scoop it away with a spoon and mix it in with some milk and coffee.

Long words, multiple syllables and a generous adjective for every noun, but only nonsense.  	I think the teacher shakes his head, sighs.  He’s glad the episode is over. 	 But it does not cure my hunger for you Leah.  I’m hungry, again.  Let me bask in the gloom of your sublunar harem.  Let me perspire in its red humidity.  Let my tongue dance to the song of your name, again.    Leah.   +Stars 	The wife turned out the lone light of the bedroom and all was abruptly black.  	The wife sighed.  	The husband sighed.  	“Mmm, how was your day?” asked the wife to the husband, groggily.  	“It was fine.”  	“And…how are you feeling?”  	“I feel alright.”  	How neutral a statement.  As his eyes adjusted objects began to coalesce from the darkness, separating themselves from the shadows.  One bedside table.  One analog clock, with one of those wind up alarms ticking tiredly.  One small television at the end of the bed on top of one table.  The husband’s eyes drifted up the wall, slid along under the ceiling and found the skylight.  The day was being absorbed by the night like a sponge; now its last remnants were clinging to the sky like a thin film of liquid.  	“Goodnight.”  	“Goodnight.”  	I feel alright.  Of course the husband felt alright.  He was living in the middle of the American Dream.  He was too young to complain about the mundane things that old people complain about and too young to giggle at the mundane things that young people giggle at.  He hadn’t yet awoken from the American Dream to find his skin wrinkled like paper and his eyes behind scratched prescription glasses.  He was comfortable with the amount of money he had to his name, even though it was nothing special.  He was in his prime.  He was still fit.  He jogged in the park sometimes.  Women who spoke to him pretended not to notice his wedding ring.  And, of course, the husband’s wife was a trophy.    	As an adult the husband found himself wondering if there was anything more to life than what he had.  This wondering of his had begun to increase in frequency as year after year passed behind him and as years long gone began to blend together from separate frames to seamless films, blurring as if his mind’s projector was out of focus.  	There was one star in the sky.  He noticed quickly that it was a rigid star, in that it didn’t glimmer or flicker back and forth between colors.  He remembered reading somewhere that stars that don’t flicker are actually planets.  He didn’t remember exactly where he had read it.  Even though he didn’t know a great deal about astronomy and had never taken a marked interest in the science he felt like he had always known that stars that don’t flicker are planets.    	He was a teenager again.  His facial muscles had numbed in the cold and his breath was slow and gray against the night.  He was wearing one of those puffy jackets; it was a rusty red and very warm.  Very comfortable.  He was lying down on some gravel.  There was a group of girls, no…just one, just one girl next to him.  He didn’t remember who she was, what her name was or how they had met, but he knew that he didn’t like her that much.  She just didn’t interest him.  She never did or said anything that raised an eyebrow.  She had never sparked an extra synapse.  She was a normal American female teenager in every sense.  They could have written a sitcom around her.  But she liked him.  She was shy about it, but he knew.  It wasn’t too hard to tell.  Those extra-long glances, those laughs one laugh too much for a particular joke, the looks her friends gave him when they didn’t think he was watching.  That was his evidence.    	And, somehow, he had wound up lying down next to her on top of some gravel under a cloudy night sky.  The clouds parted, briefly, offering the pair a cliché romantic moment.  He’d get the hell out of there if she made a move on him, stand up and run—  	“Look,” she said, “a star.”  	The poetry.  “It’s not a star,” he murmured, “it’s a planet.”  	So the husband knew the difference between stars and planets even then, what was it…must have been fifteen years ago.    	He could hear Wagner playing in the background.  Lohengrin, act one.  His parents weren’t Nazis but they liked Wagner.  It was warm and golden in his living room.  He was lying on his stomach next to a purring fireplace, the embers watching him with unblinking eyes.  There was a book in front of him, a thin book.  It was easy to read.  He didn’t have to sound out any big words.  There were two cartoon characters on the opened page.  They were simple drawings.  One was a dog, the other a cat.  The dog was standing up and pointing at a bright star in the sky, and reciting…something…what was he saying…  	“When you wish upon a star—”  	The cat was interrupting him.  “No, silly!  Be careful where you wish, because some stars are actually planets!  Planets don’t ever flicker like stars and are usually brighter.  So if you don’t make sure you’re wishing on a star your wish might not come true!”  	In the next frame, the dog was pointing at a different star.    	“When you wish upon a star—”  	“Now that’s better!” said the cat, triumphantly, as if he had conquered the world.  	But then the husband remembered that the cat had no voice.  The cat never said anything.  Cats couldn’t even talk.  The cat wasn’t alive.  The cat’s existence didn’t extend beyond the two dimensional paper he had been printed on.  The cat didn’t even have a gender.  The husband had only guessed that it was a he.  Who knew?  	Who knew that the husband would be lying in his bed staring at a lone star one night with thirty-three years behind him and not a single shred of uniqueness to it to set him apart from the other six billion people he shared the planet with.  Who knew that when the husband died he would be lucky to be counted as even a number in a statistic to future generations, that one day everything that he had created and everyone that he had loved would be gone, that one day it would be as if he had not existed at all.  He was here!  The husband did exist!  He was not a vertical scratch mark on a tally.  He was not the third decimal in a percentage.  He was not a machine.  He was not a replaceable wheel within a wheel within a wheel.  He was…more.  He was a man.  One man, with a life, and an existence, and memories, and thoughts and foods that tasted good and smells that smelt good and golden sights that pleased the eye and people that smiled at him and people that annoyed him and people that laughed with him…  	The husband was not the cat.  He was not as expendable or as lifeless as the cat.  The cat was a drawing.  The cat was a friendly display of information and nothing more.  The cat had never lived and had never died.  It had never been pulled from its mother’s belly, it had never scored badly on an important test, it had never crashed a car, it had never loved another, it had never hated another, it was nothing more than a display.  A display!  	But then…after he died the cat would go on.  The cat would endure decades and centuries, maybe, even though it had no name.  The cat could never die because it was never alive.  Its slice of mundane information would be seen and acknowledge by so many people, maybe an infinite amount of people, maybe forever.  Some stars are actually planets!  And if it was alive and if it was tangible then it would be laughing at the husband all the way, because although it wasn’t human it was beating him and beating him effortlessly by relaying a sentence of useless information to toddlers.  	The husband’s wife turned in the bed and faced him, noticed that he was still awake.  She leaned forward and kissed his cheek.    	He turned to her, looked her in her bleary eyes.  He felt the despair welling up in his throat, waiting to be  released.  He wanted to talk to her about the cat; he wanted her to say something that would make him feel better instantly.  	She smiled, her cheeks lifting like curtains.  “I love you.”  	He paused.  Nothing.  Then, the two were smiling together.  Two.  “I love you.” 	 She closed her eyes and her grin still tinged her cheeks.  He looked back to the sky.  Such a relief and a happiness filled him then, when he realized that there were now thousands of stars looking back to him.  He exhaled out of smiling lips, the despair caught in his breath’s wake.    Then, resolutely, he closed his eyes and dreamed.   +Rancid Milk from My Breasts   	I’ll be the first teenager in this school to admit that I lactate often.  I carry at least three changes of shirts in my backpack every day and usually wind up using all of them before leaving for home.  My bras are usually so putrid, so soggy, as to warrant their disposal by nighttime.  The stench is overpowering.  One time I actually knocked myself out.  Just keeled over, right in the middle of the hallway, my arms crossed, on the way to my locker to get a shirt to change into.  It was a challenge to explain to the teacher who found me how I had collapsed, and much more, why I was lying in a pool of greenish milk.  Such a challenge, in fact, that I didn’t need to explain it to her at all, as she too succumbed to the toxins dripping from my swollen nipples.  She was a sub, just out of college, so no one really listened to her when she later complained to the school.  I got lucky.  	Lactation to me is like sweating for most other people.  I lactate when I’m nervous.  I lactate when I exercise.  I lactate when I’m angry.  I lactate when I’m in love.  This is the thing that sets me apart from other teenagers.  A girl could say, “I can write cursive with my nipples when I put ink on them,” or a guy could say, “I can hit a target with my jiz ten feet away.”  Well, I can say, “I lactate more than a sea manatee pregnant with ten kids.”  And you know what, that’s saying a lot.  	I’ve always been a remarkable specimen.  This is my life’s story.  	I was not the product of marriage.  Nor was I the product of heterosexual union.  It’s an interesting story that I’ve pieced together over the entire course of my life—how I came to be who I am.  I had two fathers.  Both met in Algeria.  One of them was a shipwrecked sailor trying to find his way home, to Bar Harbor, in fact.  I’ve seen pictures of him—his hair is slick and shiny, he wore tight, white pants often.   Now that I think about it, he kind of looks like the perfect Aryan.  White.  Blond hair, blue eyes.  Strong chin.  A real American, just trying to get back home to his faithful dog, Lasso.  My first father’s name was Reginald.    The other was a destitute descendant of a small Mongol War party that ravaged the area hundreds of years ago, a man out of place in any setting.  He was tall, muscular.  He wore a Viking-themed helmet that he had stolen off of a chubby feminist, who was later ravaged by a starving pack of wild camels.  His diet consisted primarily of sand and Mediterranean seawater, two of the only abundant supplies in Algeria.  He was also mute.  My second father’s name was, appropriately, Genghis.  Sixteen years ago the two met one night in a cave overlooking the Saharan sands.  Reginald was impressed with Genghis’ ability to listen, it seemed that the Mongol embodied some of beloved Lasso in him.  Their lovemaking was over in minutes.  On the cave floor, while the two slept dreamily in each other’s arms, somehow a pair of sperm, one from each parent, combined.  Under the light of the full moon the first stage of my life had begun.    When morning came my parents departed the hostile heat of the desert, arm in arm, never to return.  They didn’t notice the dusty bit of moisture steadily growing inside; if they saw it at all it must have resembled a loogie more than anything else.    Adventures beyond what anyone could imagine awaited my gestating fetus.  The horrors I would confront, and my immigration to America would test the limits of a baby born in the desert of two fathers.

      After between ten and fifteen seconds of wondering why I'm not as depressed as so many other people my age I came to a conclusion.  Interpret it as you will.  I am different from the majority of my fellows because I have deluded myself into believing that I have something of a future for myself, beyond working in physical therapy or as a dishwasher.   I decided a long time ago that I would [i]hope[/i] to become rich and influential; I'm not supposed to [i]think[/i] that such a thing will happen, because that would be conceited, and being conceited is bad.  That reminds me, for a digression, of a Peer Mediation meeting I went to, where we had to draw up some posters highlighting what elementary school students were and weren't supposed to do.  I had the topic "lying."  And, being the blunt person that I am, instead of writing "lying will make you a socialist, and socialists are bad" like we were supposed to, I cut to the chase, and instead wrote something like "lying is bad, bad, bad."  That apparently got the rest of the people in the group, at least the ones that took it seriously, noticeably angry.  The following week I was pulled out of class by the teacher who leads the group, and told that I was "too funny" to stay with Peer Mediation.  I would either have to convert to drone-ism, and write "buddha smiles upon people who tell the truth, by the way, we're multicultural!" or leave.  I said I would keep going, but I lied, because they're dicks.    Anyway, where was I...yes...instead of hoping I'll have a succesful writing carreer, I'm thinking that I will, which is dangerous, because of the likelihood that I'll be let down.  But I am making progress.  A five month old piece of writing was handed off to an assistant editor that works with my aunt (a children's-book-publishing-czar, a title she has every right to refute, as I just made it up, but it may give you an idea of her position: high level in a big company), who, surprisingly, loved the piece and, among sending back helpful criticisms, asked for a rewrite as soon as possible.  I was estatic, because I had all but given up on the piece that I gave my aunt.  It was old, and let's be blunt: it sucked, it was awful awful awful.  With his criticisms, though, I think I have produced something significantly better, something that I am enormously proud of.  As soon as we get the paper, I'll be mailing it back to him.  There is one thing I am concerned about.  From what I know of him, little more than his far-more-than-adequate ability to provide constructive criticism, and his name, I know that he knows, and probably works for, my aunt.  This raises a question: what if he thought that he had to like my piece, because if he didn't, he might get fired, or passed up on a promotion?  What if this is all a lie, what if what I'm writing is really crap, and I'm no closer to getting filthy rich than I was a year or a decade ago?  I guess we'll have to wait for his reply.  I'll be sending the revised draft off to him as soon as I can get my hands on some paper.  As for "Hungry, Again" the title of that story has been changed to "Sublunar Harem" (love that name).  I also changed the main character's name, it'll be my little secret that it was originally about Meaghan, who beyond her physical features (which I'm not so positive about anymore) I don't really like to begin with, as she seems to be somewhat insecure.  On to campos m?s verdes.

      Smith’s Pantheon  	Smith lifted his eyes and knew immediately that it was time for a walk.  He didn’t need a clock to tell him that.  He’d never needed a clock to tell him anything.  Smith resented people that lived by their watches, who ate when it was time to eat, who drank when it was time to drink.  But Smith was compassionate, understanding—he knew people weren’t born that way.  Each had bought a watch of his or her own free will, once upon a time, but then, ever so slowly, the watch had conquered any independence these poor souls might have had, its fingerless hands ardently gripping the reins that harnessed them as if they were mindless animals.    No, he didn’t own a watch.  He didn’t own a clock.  It was time to walk because Smith felt like walking.  He was full.  He’d tested the limits of his stomach, with spaghetti.  Now it was time to walk it off.    	It was still a dreary day.  The sun strained to glare at him behind a thick swath of clouds.  Smith stepped down from the cabin’s porch, onto the moist dirt, looked to the wall of trees before him, their timber tentacles straining to touch the white sky.  He entered their domain, leaving his little colony of civilization behind.    	Smith had become fed up with everything.  That’s why he was there, in the middle of the wilderness.  Smith saw a world that he had no desire to be a part of, on the news, every night, over and over again.  Miseries and the voyeurism associated with them were in a golden vogue.  Profit before human need.  Families across America sat together on their striped couches in their cramped, dim living rooms, eyes wide, dilated, faces expressionless, the stern televisions blinking angrily at them with death, commercials, and then more death.  Smith was never an advocate of censorship, in any form, but the screaming mothers and the silent coffins really didn’t seem to be changing minds—they kept dropping carpet bombs, they kept firing missiles, they kept shooting guns.  And we kept watching.  We couldn’t get enough of it, apparently, because, to be honest, we just never stopped.  Smith didn’t have a problem with the images, no; he had a problem with the universal, American apathy toward taking action against clear wrongdoing.  Everyone thought someone else would do something about the carnage, but this notion was so widespread that nothing constructive was ever accomplished.  Injustices went unsolved, unpunished, people forgot and moved on.  Smith didn’t want to call himself one of them anymore, because gradually he discovered that he wasn’t one of them.  They thought he was, though, and it was embarrassing.  So he gathered his savings and left.  	He was alone, but not lonely.  Alone was the way to be in that world.  Back in the city, it wasn’t long before Smith realized that relationships in any form were taxing, bothersome, trivial.  He didn’t need them.  Isolation solaced him, gave him time to do what he wanted, when he wanted, without a person to worry about for miles in every direction.  That’s just how he was.  That’s how he thought—they could kill each other, fuck each other over, as long as he didn’t have to deal with it.  Let the world burn.  Smith wouldn’t have been surprised if everything collapsed during his self-imposed exile.  Everyone knows Earth has it coming, he thought.  He didn’t want to think about that anymore.  He shut the planet out of his mind and walked enthusiastically into the wide arms of the forest.  Robins chattered an undulating tempo above Smith’s head.  He heard something rustle behind a pile of browned leaves, cocked his head toward it.  A chipmunk sprouted up a tree some feet ahead.  He ascended the small mountain he lived on, the mountain that, as far as Smith knew, held no name.  It was an easy walk, at a pleasurably steep angle.  He walked fast and burned his calves without breaking a sweat, and as the forest thinned the mountain became more obvious, a frozen landslide of boulders led to its crest.  He leaped over the rocks, hoisted himself onto ledges, felt dried moss prick his fingers, granite bite his palms.  He lifted himself to one of the larger stones near the top.  A column of ants wormed its way beneath his legs, between his hiking boots.  One left the line, touched his shoelaces with its antennae, then skittered back to its group.  Smith sighed.  He didn’t know why he thought of it then, but he reached his fingers into his pocket and picked out a quarter, set it on the rock’s surface, in the path of the ants.  They ignored it entirely.  Something to admire—ants have civilization, ants have society, ants divide their labor, but most of all, ants don’t give a shit about money.  It’s possible to live without money.  Hell, ants do it all the time; they thrive without ever thinking about it.  What’d you say, we’re different species?  Ha!  Sure we are.  It’s easier to live with lies than with truths, isn’t it?  The clouds had cleared and the sky had blazed to pink.  Smith reached the summit as the sun licked the horizon with its iridescent tongue.  He stood there and watched in awe as it drooped beneath the shoulders of the world.  Its colorful saliva lingered for a bit after it had disappeared, but before long the last tinges were evaporated.  The cold chased the warmth away.  He was left with the bare, star-spackled sky.  He’d never seen a view like that back in the city, even in the suburbs.  Like standing at the center of a football stadium, with thousands of noiseless camera flashes directed solely at Smith, standing alone, quiet on its field.    Stars.  He sat down on the rock and was surprised to find that it was cold, made of metal.  He lowered his eyes and read the letters:  MOUNT PANTHEON  	There was a sentence or two beneath, but the writing was too small and his vision was going anyway so he didn’t bother.  He raised his eyebrows.  So that was the name of the mountain.  Interesting.  Never heard of Mount Pantheon.  Definitely an odd name for a mountain, especially a small one.    	Something pushed against the air, then.  Something was pumping.  A shrill wine grew behind the fast chorus of beats.  As the percussion intensified, Smith looked to see the distant silhouette of a double-rotor helicopter, a red light on its underside blinking desperately.  It shot over Smith’s head, the shriek of its engine all but unbearable.  His nose inhaled a plume of dry, acrid smoke.  He watched as it tried to gain altitude, and stood as it dropped back toward him, like a pendulum, swinging its nose to face his widened eyes.  Smith dropped to his stomach, buried his head beneath his arms, heard its raucous scream flood his ears.  Something cold slid over Smith’s shoulders, something smooth and metallic.  He heard a horrific scraping noise.  Instinctively, Smith looked forward; saw its nose dancing on the summit’s edge mere feet away.  It fell, upside-down, onto the landslide of rocks.  Its body smashed and crumpled into a terrible wreck, a serrated corpse that belched bright flame and black smoke into the sky.  Smith stood, and Smith ran.  Right at it.  He leaped over rocks, past burning metal shards dipped in oil and blood.  The same colony of ants he had passed was fleeing the wreckage, swarming over the boulders and spilling off into the forest.  The jaws of flame roared at him like a hound out of Hades as he climbed through the shattered cockpit windows, past two gutted pilots slumped in their upside-down chairs, their belts slick with their insides.  Smith knew, just looking at them, they were dead.  He paused, with the realization that he had never been so close to a warm corpse.  He tried to meet the empty gaze of their eyes like a timorous toddler, but saw nothing.  He stretched out his hand, furtively touched the helmet of one of the pilots.  It burned his fingers, he yanked them back.  Smith retreated from the bodies, bumped against the cockpit wall.  He shook his head, blinked, realized there might be survivors.  Smith moved down the ceiling of a thin corridor, through veils of smoke and tongues of flame, calling to see if anyone were alive.  Smith heard a shout, ran toward it.  	In the bay of the helicopter there were boxes containing bullets as large as Smith’s middle finger strewn across the ceiling, apparently they hadn’t been secured.  The door at the end of the body was open wide, and a large machine gun pointed down to the steep slope of white rocks he had climbed barely minutes before.  Grasping the barrel of the gun, his legs pointed at the ceiling, was a soldier.  Smith weaved through the boxes, wrapped his fingers around a handhold on the wall, and extended his other arm.  	The soldier screamed for help; Smith screamed his assurances.  	Smith’s fingertips couldn’t get a grip.  The man was too far away.  Smith stretched out as much as he could, straining to keep a grip on the handhold, his center of gravity well over the edge of the helicopter’s ceiling.  The ship jolted and creaked, angrily.  A box of ammunition hit Smith in the head.  Golden bullets rained out of the cargo hold, most of them pattering on the soldier’s uniform.  The trees loomed below.    	The soldier became more anxious; Smith found it harder to feign calmness.  	He told Smith his finger was wrapped around the trigger of the gun, that the gun was loaded.  Smith asked him why the hell the gun was loaded.  The soldier told him, because they were the military, they always had their guns loaded, they were ready for anything.  Smith asked him what they were looking for; the soldier said he had no idea what they were looking for anymore, but that, furthermore, this was no time for conversation.  Then the soldier said he was going to try to get a better grip.  	The mouth of the gun burst a stream of bullets, riddling his body with them.  Smith looked away, clenched his teeth.  The gun’s percussion didn’t stop until it was out of ammunition, but the hammer’s drum was unending.  The corpse hung by the finger that pressed against the trigger, the momentum from the golden bullets causing him to twirl like a cocooned insect suspended from a spider web.  The helicopter creaked again, and the forest rushed toward Smith.  He could only sigh in terror, dilate his eyes.  A tree lanced from the dark earth and jammed itself against the inner wall of the cargo hold.  Its leaves and branches cut against his skin, and he lost his grip, fell through the air and rolled over the moist soil.    	After a time Smith managed to get to his feet, though his ribs protested the movement vehemently.  He looked upward and saw the corrugated beast pointing its nose vertically to the sky.  The copter’s mouth had swallowed the tree and the throat of the cargo hold seemed to be gagging on it.  But the machine balanced there, blazing its fires with a passion from wounds that were visibly growing in size.  One last bullet fell into Smith’s open hand.  His fingers tightened around it, and he screamed as he threw it back at the helicopter’s corpse.    It could keep its bullets.

      Today comes on the eve of a new beginning.  Summer has finally arrived.  School is fading into the background for me, my free time has tripled, quadrupled since last week, when I spent practically ever waking moment studying for standardized tests or reading up on APUSH assignments. Now I can go work out, go running, wear myself out with my excersizes and not even really worry about it. I have a 98 average in the only class I care about, which will not be hard to maintain (we have only one more assignment in the class, a big one, something that will not come with a grade less than an A). Although there is a great deal to Spanish that I have to learn, and a great deal that I have learned that I'm not totally comfortable using, four years of it have brought me up to a point where I feel that I can express a good portion of my thoughts in a language other than the one I was born into. I have a long way to go, I won't be fluent until I spend some time in a foreign country, but it's a nice feeling.   The play ended last weekend.  God, what an ego trip...people who avoid eye contact with you during school, coming up to you, hugging you, telling you you're the funniest thing they've ever seen, embarassed to admit it. Running up the aisle after the show is over, everyone standing, clapping, watching YOU. It's really something. I hope this won't be the last time it happens.  I'm also not sure if I've ever really recognized the Dune series for how brilliant it really is. Never, ever have I seen such an amalgamation of psychology and philosophy put together into such an interesting, readable, enjoyable format. It's an esoteric universe he's created and it takes a bit of effort to really comprehend it, but it's just so amazing once you understand even a little of it, or think that you do. There's so much going on, all the time.  Wheels within wheels within wheels.  And I've had more time to write.  An hour a day.  Short stories are turning into novellas.

      Yesterday began when school ended.  My friends and I hit the town in midafternoon, when it was relatively warm.  The sun was everywhere with its warmth but nowhere with its face. Breeze chilled by the sea drifted through the town, after traveling over the rocks of the beach, through green leaves and greener grasses. Living so close to the ocean produces a kind of thick, salty flavor to the air (when you take the time to notice it), tangy with the moisture seeping from the wilderness. I remember the town being yellow, practically everywhere. I was in my pink Cape Cod shirt, which is "cleverly" disguised with a Coca~Cola insignia that, hey, whoa, really says Cape Cod.  I don't even really like Cape Cod that much, I just think the shirt serves as a therapy for my (inherent) homophobia. To top it all off I bought it in Provincetown, which is, in my opinion, a shithole, not because of the gay people, but because it's nothing more than a tourist trap. My family had fun going through the shops, giving away their twenties for rocks the dealers picked up on the nearby beaches, rocks that have somehow disappeared now, a year or two later. But I digress...  After some time we decided to search out the elusive Sally. Sally herself is a thing descended from heaven, though by her appearance you wouldn't think so. She hides herself behind dark makeup and darker clothes, which is perhaps the greatest calamity of the century. Yes, I realize the century is only two and half years old.  I can remember a time, long ago, when I heard her voice reverberate through my ears, a voice that would have stopped my heart if I lived in a more dramatic universe. It's a remarkable voice. Let me attempt to describe it--  Imagine for a moment that the roles of Adam and Eve are reversed.  Adam is the one tempted by the snake. You're Adam, looking at the snake, hearing the snake's salacious voice ("voce salax?") curve your mind and your vision. The voice is deep, seemingly caught in the snake's throat for a little longer than usual, like a river of water drifting into a tangle of canals before reassembling on the other side. Adam doesn't even understand the snake (as everyone knows that snakes don't speak English, or Aramaic, if you're Mel Gibson and up for a reinterpretation of the Jewish half of the Bible1). Adam doesn't have to understand the snake, though, to be corrupted by its words, to feel his infantile heart beat a little faster, to feel the first tinges of real desire clog his synapses with grit.  This is Sally's voice, at least its effect on me. Like some fabled corruption out of hell, worked beautifully by the crimson, gaunt fingers of the devil, into something delicious.  Anyway, we went to where she's supposed to work, and she wasn't there. Kind of disappointing, because I've never seen her without her makeup or her dark clothes, and I think I might lose consciousness if she were to wear something more...normal, I guess. She's a clerk at a store or something ("West End Drug"), lazily themed with useless ornaments from bygone eras. Minus the "No Coloreds Allowed" signs, of course.  And, to wrap this up, Gideon isn't that bad.  1Subtext! Digression! Yes, let's have a little discussion about Rome in Jesus' time. Tiberius is Emperor, and Tiberius is a nutcase. I believe he came directly after the glorious despotic days of Julius Caesar and Octavian.  Anyway, after completing his reign, he'd retire to a small island in the Mediterranean, don't remember its name, probably south of France? Anyway, at this island he'll spend his waning days being tempted (read: fucked) by a bevy of paid servants pretending to be nympths and fairies--children, men, women, doesn't matter. This is the man that controls the United States of its day. Rome itself is at or near its height, probably controlling parts of Britain to parts of Iraq, North Africa, Spain, essentially everything in Europe but Germany and Russia. The Eastern Half of the Empire begins at Greece, which at that time was little more than a cultural division. People in the West (France, Spain, Italy) spoke Latin, people in the East (The Balkans, Turkey, Middle East) spoke Greek. This is where you'll get two of the three big divisions of languages on the European continent we have today--the daughters of Latin, French, Spanish, Italian, Portugese, and the daughters of Greek, Russian, among other native Slavic tongues. The third big division is Germanic, where English and German come from, among others.  You can see the difference in the writing we use, and the writing they use--have a look at Cyrillic, written Russian, and see how similar it is to Ancient Greek (Hellenic). The cultural difference would eventually turn into a political rift, thanks to Diocletian, I beleive, splitting Rome into two pieces--Rome itself, and Byzantium. Constantine the Great would further this political rift, while at the same time making Christianity the religious thing-to-do. The western Empire, Rome, would fade into the Dark Ages in the fifth century, under the loose command of the Pope (Roman Catholics), while the Eastern Empire would gleam brightly for another thousand years, until the Crusades, and the Turks. Byzantium would play a heavy role in the creation of Russia, that's where the word Czar comes from--see the resemblance to Caesar?  Anyway, this digression leads up to the historical innacuracy in The Passion of the Christ. The "the" is in the word because Christ is the Greek word for Messiah, but I guess Mel didn't catch on to why people were giving Jesus a Greek name in his time. Palestine, Judea, whatever you'd like to call it, was in the Eastern portion of the Empire, which means that its people would probably have spoken Greek, as opposed to Aramaic, which I'm guessing would have been spoken by the Bedouin Arabians, who were too loose and nomadic to be useful to Rome at the time, though in later centuries, thanks to Mohammed, their region would become the center of the world.

      Some Political Predictions--  An ignorant man will be president over a divided nation in one year. The rich will keep on eating; the poor will keep on starving  I could work at Delphi.  More specifically, Kerry will be president, but won't make it to a second term.  He'll be at the beginning of a liberal backlash, which will likely see better qualified, and more leftist presidents coming to power in the next few decades (as we've had nothing but extremely conservative presidents, going all the way back to LBJ).  If I were the Iraqi insurgents... I would put a charismatic, english-speaking man as the figurehead of my organization, to endlessly taunt the United States.  I would stop working with Al Qaeda entirely, so as to garner the world's support.  If I do it at all to begin with, I would stop taking hostages, and I would stop shielding myself behind innocent Iraqi people.  I would work toward winning their hearts, not terrifying them into submission.  I would work tirelessly to destroy roadways between Iraqi settlements, but more specifically, those between U.S bases.  I would never bog down and isolate myself within a city or a fort (like Najaf, etc..). I would keep as many U.S soldiers as possible awake at all hours of the day, so as to stress them, so they'll go crazy, and make more mistakes. By any means necessary--gunfire, mortar blasts, whatever, on a very small level, so as to scare the shit out of them all the time, but without risks to my troops. My troops themselves would never engage the U.S in open combat, at least for the first stage of this plan. They would remain always on them move. They would always flee from large groups of U.S forces, play a careful game of cat-and-mouse on the desert, wearing the foreigners out, making them feel like their mission is worthless. I would also make attempts to jam the satellites watching Iraq, and any other intelligence useful to the U.S.  If things go as planned, by stage two, the United States forces would be isolated in the cities or on their bases. The next step would be to push them out of the country entirely. This would be tricky, as I'd undoubtedly be outnumbered and outgunned by quite a bit. I believe, though I'm not sure, that most of the U.S fleet, housing fighter jets, supply vehicles, and many soldiers, among other things, is in the Persian Gulf. Somehow, someway, I'd have to blockade that region. An idea I have would involve detonating huge portions of the northern U.A.E and a bit of southern Iran, to close up the thinnest portion of the Persian Gulf. When effectively accomplished, I could POSSIBLY destroy an enormous portion of the Navy, and give the troops remaining in Iraq a huge supply problem.  There's also the Mediterranean Sea, which could be effectively blockaded at two points--the Straight of Gibraltar, and the Suez Canal.  MOre later.

      I'm nearing the end of my junior year.  I think we get out on the sixteenth, which is still farther off than I'd like, but nevertheless the end is close.  When applying for the George Washington Summer Scholars program I recieved a printout of my grades.  I wasn't impressed, really, at all.  3.0 average at the most, and that just isn't good enough.  I don't know what the hell I've been doing at this school for three years.  Like I was in a fugue, all my goddamned life, autopilot, not thinking, not doing, close to unconsciousness.  Things could always be worse, but that's the solace I think everyone on Earth finds, or, more likely, pretends to find--from those poor, emaciated bastards in Africa to the richest execs in the country.  It may comfort them...but it doesn't comfort me.  I can say, hey, I've probably got something close to a 3.0 GPA! I've got a ton of friends, everywhere, and overall, people seem to like me. Favorable reactions from girls--wow, maybe I'm not the most hideous piece of slag on the Earth! I write--hey, there's a unique hobby! My arms are getting bigger, wonderful!   Yet, this is just a thin membrane of oil coating an ocean, and beneath, there are the problems. I feel out of place when I'm not stridently trying to impress someone. Christ, I feel out of place wherever I go. I enjoy reading, I enjoy writing, I enjoy learning, but I haven't been able to stop playing video games. It isn't constructive, doing that, not like reading Generation of Vipers, The Seven Pillars of Wisdom, Chapterhouse:Dune, not like writing Void. I enjoy playing, and it's a problem.   On top of that, one of the intellectuals I look up to is endlessly critical, endlessly querulous, he contradicts or insults everything I say. If I ever manage to corner him, in these brief sparring matches we have, he just shouts something random at me, sometimes something exceedingly vicious, and any audience we've accumulated laughs it off, any victory I might have had over him evaporates, not only in his mind, but in the minds of those watching us as well. It just seems impossible to gain any kind of new respect, any kind of new ground that might allow more people to take me more seriously more often. I don't know what's changed in him--almost the whole time I've known him (several years) he's unconsciously spent contradicting me, sometimes to my detriment, sometimes to his.  Recently, this began to change, he started to listen to me more openly. But then, from nowhere, it all collapsed, it all ended. Now, most of the time, I really can't stand to be around him. Privately, at least, he isn't that bad, he doesn't have an audience to entertain, but publicly he lambasts me endlessly at even the slightest comment on my part. It's become such a problem that I often restrain myself from speaking during classroom discussions, because somehow, someway, he's going to make me look like a retard in front of a group of people at the top of the high school's social heirarchy. I don't know what to do.   As I mentioned, I looked up to this guy, even though he has an unreliable work ethic, even though he seems unstable, and even though his comments in practically any respect tend to be excessively negative, he has read a great deal of books and is likely a better writer than I am. There's a lot of knowledge in there. That's why it's affected me so much--here's a person with knowledge and intelligence that seems to believe, for all intents and purposes, that I am no better than the scum of the earth. That I am an idiot. Insults on my appearance, on my manner, comedy, voice, character, whatever, they don't really effect me, but an insult toward any kind of intelligence that I have garnered from my labors goes straight to the core.   It's a reason I stopped sitting with my normal friends at the lunch table--one day I almost sat down, I asked him about a book, he referred to me as "stupid," or something ignoble to that effect, again, vicious for no reason that I could discern, so I thought immediately that I didn't have to take it. I wasn't going to fight him, or attack him, or anything stupid like that, wasn't going to sink to his level by calling him a moron: I was going to leave, and stay away for as long as I could. That's what I've been doing, I've been hanging out with my senior friends, who won't be here after the end of the week. I'll have to go back, soon. I'm worried that I'm going to crack, though I don't think the pressure has reached that point, it's possible that it will.  This is what's affecting me. I hope to get published, to get accepted to D.C, spend my time at the capital for a month and a half, because that at the moment seems to be my only hope for getting into a good college, and therefore, chasing money signs for the rest of my life, as I'm not going to be able to do it with the grades that I have right now. I'm going to miss my senior friends, people I've largely grown to like through my spanish 4 class, my experiences in the drama department, and my moving from the lunch room to the art room to drink my chocolate milk. I recieved a Pride Award for being the comeback kid in my APUSH class, as I have a 98 in it right now, though, to the best of my knowledge, my work habit, my study habits, have largely remained unchanged, since at least the second quarter of the year.  Frankly, I don't know how the hell I've pulled that one off...and I'm not confident that it's going to remain at that level, as much as I'd like it to.  Girls are interesting too...they're challenging to take hold of, like dreams you can't quite remember. Those that I can grasp I find myself unnattracted to: as soon as my conqust of their hearts is over, they become unnattractive. It's a monotonous cycle and I'm tired of it. I'm running out of time, to find myself a girl before the summer arrives, one that becomes attractive after she's been conquered, but I'm still working on it, to the best of my ability, I think. As HAL says, I'm working as hard as I can, which is all any sentient creature can hope to do.

      I'm going to Washington D.C.  When I got the letter from GW University I began to jump up and down and croak happily, kind of like a toad, because my voice has been cracked for a few days now. I'm very excited about this. I'll be spending six weeks in the capital, from July 5th to August 15th. This sort of thing looks good on a college resume, better than a B average, anyway. New friends...new ideas...in a new place, in whitewashed D.C.  I've considered the posibility of a nuclear bomb going off there, of course. I'm an American, we think of such things when planning trips. Though I've rued the idea of dying at all, I've thought for quite awhile now that I won't be making it out of my teens. I could die in a car crash, of some rare cancer, smallpox--but I think if I were to die of some unnatural cause, being caught in the middle of a screaming nuclear explosion would be my choice. If I'm close enough to the blast I may provide a bit more fuel for the fire as well, as my science teacher told me three years ago that those things convert matter directly into energy.  That would probably be pretty painful, but I'm not sure I'd be alive long enough for the feeling to climb up to my brain.  Went to a party last night. It was good. Nurples turned purple, couldn't work up the nerve to purple others' nurples.  I saw a sign up near a church that read "CHILDREN'S CRUSADE." I think it was some kind of help-the-community type thing, not really sure, but what vexed me was the title--as the so-called Children's Crusade that occured in the Middle Ages resulted in a march to southern France of, yes, a bunch of insane, zealous chilluns, that, upon reaching the warmth of the Mediterrannean, were promptly sold off into slavery by their fellow Christians.  They were convinced that the sea would part for them, and allow them to walk to Jerusalem, where they could slay the heretic Saracens, that sort of thing.  Would have been a hell of a long walk.  Great story.  Great name for an event, too.  Willy gave us the finger in Bar Harbor. Rich chased after him, but to no avail. Isabella said she wasn't into environmental disaster movies, because she didn't like the idea of thinking about something that was inevitable, which kind of goes against her whole hippy "I want to save the environment" ideal but we didn't really call her out on that. I think I like her sister way more, anyway. Read more of the Seven Pillars of Wisdom today, because I have to have it finished by Wednesday and have about two hundred pages to go. Situation negative.  Just saw the Day After Tomorrow an hour or so ago. No, not the future, the movie.  Was entertaining, mostly because I was there with Rich, who spent the whole movie giggling with me about the really stupid things that kept happening. Like a British pilot in a helicopter that's just frozen in midair, not saying "oh, bloodyell," not saying "I wish I could see me mum," oh no, this guy, being british, and royal and paternal, says "prepare for crash landing."  Preparing, why are you always preparing? Just GO! Did he honestly think that his fellow crewmembers really needed to KNOW that they should prepare for a crash landing? That, perhaps they couldn't figure it out on their own, what with the chopper's rotors freezing? And then Dennis Quaid pulled this really, really, really wierd smile at the end, like he was getting ready to molest someone...or someTHING. Like he pricked himself on a syringe loaded with morphine.   The women in the movie were all fairly hot, which kind of kept me from effectively judging their acting ability.  Quaid's wife played the concerned MILF role. Donnie D'Arco's girlfriend played the "I have large lips and a bright gaze" role. And the Asian woman played the "Chief Science Officer Spock" role. Beyond that they really didn't do anything.  All in all, pretty stereotypical too. I noticed that the black people kept getting told to shut up, which was kind of funny. The movie was definitely not as sweet as Independence Day, though it was by the same director.  I think because the other film had a clear bad guy, someone to fight, and perhaps more inspiring characters (though they were still cardboard stereotypical cutouts, they were a step up from the ones in TDAT). I like Dennis Quaid, thought he was pretty cool in The Alamo and Frequency, but....meh...entertaining movie. Not good, entertaining. No interesting camera shots. None. Characters were nonexistent--the best actor in the movie was probably the homeless guy's dog, who also happened to have the most interesting lines in the film, consisting mainly of barking at the sky.  All in all, like most movies, excepting Braveheart, to think of one, it would have been better if I had directed it.

      It's been a balmy day.  Feels like my skin has added a layer of sweat onto my entire body.  How sensual.  Here's a story.  I was reading in my room, when a junebug flew in through my window.  I kind of freaked out, but not really.  I then found a cup, got the junebug, and put it back outside.  Then I closed my window.  Great story.  Had you going on that one.  I hate it when you put your boxer shorts on backwards, and then you don't feel like taking them off and putting them on again, so you walk out your room anyway, into another room, and discover someone else sitting there.  Then you hold the ass of your shorts together when you walk by, so the smile doesn't peek through the veil, so to speak.  Because you don't feel like going back into your room, because of how goddamn hot it is.  Pretty rough.  We're going to see a B-17 tomorrow.  No, we won't be bombing any Germans.  Or Japanese.  They're only our POLITICAL enemies, now.  Except for the Japanese--Japan is an American vassal state, you know.  Meaghan said I was a little pompous today, when I suggested she turn her [bountiful] bangs into a cowlick.  I wasn't impressed, and I don't think she was either.  That's the extent of our relationship, really.  Amy said I need girl lessons, but that's what she always says.  It's kind of her thing.  She's got some philosophical issues of her own that I would be more than willing to assist her with, but philosophy turns most girls off.  Femeninity, you see.  They're too good for knowledge.  Elaine's cooler when she isn't around other people, but that's the way practically everyone is. The shields they put up around themselves, the desire to impress others at the expense of yourself, all of it goes away when you're alone with someone else. Or, most of it, anyway.   With this new counter I've got, I've realized that a lot of people come here off of searches for breast related topics.  Breast-increasing exercises, one guy came here on a search for handjobs. Apparently he wasn't very good at the art on the individual level. When it comes to breasts, sure, they help, but they're not what it's all about. Sure, they mesmerize, they hypnotize, and sometimes you have to censure yourself, lest you reach out and pinch them, or something, but...uh...where was I...  Oh, yes, breasts.  Because it'll get me more hits. As I said, boobs help, but they're not what it's all about.  Girls wishing for bigger boobs should read a good book instead--it'll pay off a lot more in the long run.  You'll get a better guy, that has more things on his mind than how cool it would be for the Gipper and Dale Earnhardt jr. to be on the same commemorative plastic dinner plate.  That's not me, by the way.  I think that's a stupid idea.  Generation of Vipers is a good book to start with.  Know thyself, you know?  A house divided against itself cannot stand.  Reagan was a total asshole, by the way.  I'm sorry he couldn't have kept living on in agony like that, paying for all the people that died byzantine deaths because of him.  More info on that  urlLink here . Good read, if you can stomach it.  Me on religion: balance is the way to be.  That's what the yin yang is all about--balance.  In one extremity is the seed of the opposite, therefore extremes are useless. Absolute good will birth absolute evil, whereas moderation will produce nothing but. So, be religious, or don't be (as atheism and agnosticism are still belief systems, there's as much evidence to support them as there is evidence to support shintoism), but don't go nuts about being either, as you're just bringing yourself and others down when you do that, and you're sinking to the level of the other extreme that you undoubtedly preach so heartily against.  For instance, is the atheist who rants blindly against christians able to see that perhaps, not all christians are that bad?  Not if he's blind. Same goes for the opposite. Same goes for people who are so avidly against gay marriage, as their hysterical hatred of gays undoubtedly stems from a childhood insecurity.  There you have your yin and yang.  So, look into yourself, balance yourself, christian, taoist, atheist, whatever. I call myself an agnostic because, for the moment it seems like the most logical thing to do.  No logical evidence to support YHWH, no logical evidence to deny him. Therefore I'm on the midground. Though, as long as they don't act like dicks, I could care less about what other people think. That's the way to be.  That said, something I read elsewhere, for bible toters:  "Thank you for doing so much to educate people regarding God's Law. I have learned a great deal here, and I try to share that knowledge with as many people as I can. When someone tries to defend the homosexual lifestyle, for example, I simply remind him that Leviticus 18:22 clearly states it to be an abomination. End of debate.   I do need some advice from you, however, regarding some of the specific laws and how to best follow them.   a) When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a pleasing odor for the Lord (Lev 1:9). The problem is my neighbors. They claim the odor is not pleasing to them. Should I smite them?   b) I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as sanctioned in Exodus 21:7. In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for her?   c) I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her period of menstrual uncleanliness (Lev 15:19-24). The problem is, how do I tell? I have tried asking, but most women take offense.   d) Lev. 25:44 states that I may indeed possess slaves, both male and female, provided they are purchased from neighboring nations. A friend of mine claims that this applies to Mexicans, but not Canadians. Can you clarify? Why can't I own Canadians?   e) I have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2 clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him myself?   f) A friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an Abomination (Lev 11:10), it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality. I don't agree. Can you settle this?   g) Lev 21:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading glasses. Does my vision have to be 20/20, or is there some wiggle room here?   h) Most of my male friends get their hair trimmed, including the hair around their temples, even though this is expressly forbidden by Lev 19:27. How should they die?   i) I know from Lev 11:6-8 that touching the skin of a dead pig makes me unclean, but may I still play football if I wear gloves?   j) My uncle has a farm. He violates Lev 19:19 by planting two different crops in the same field, as does his wife by wearing garments made of two different kinds of thread (cotton/polyester blend). He also tends to curse and blaspheme a lot. Is it really necessary that we go to all the trouble of getting the whole town together to stone them? (Lev 24:10-16) Couldn't we just burn them to death at a private family affair like we do with people who sleep with their in-laws? (Lev. 20:14)   I know you have studied these things extensively, so I am confident you can help.   Thank you again for reminding us that God's word is eternal and unchanging." from eg1984.blogspot.com  Yin and yang--live a good life, you can live it by the bible, but realize that the bible was written by a bunch of medieval men, about a bunch of murderous savages who've thankfully been extinct for thousands of years. It's too bad that everything cited in that article comes from the Jewish half of the bible, as the craziest religious American fuckers tend to ignore the first half (see http://www.guerrillanews.com/counter_intelligence/doc1760.html). You should read that article, the answer all these nutty elites have to every question is "Jesus."  Mom, where did you put my socks?  Jesus. Mom, what happened to Fido? Jesus.  Mom, why do you keep gazing longingly at the teenager selling hot dogs across the street? Jesus. Mr. President, why did you invade Iraq? Jesus. Almighty Jeebus.  If you can look past that, so much the better, but, still. Mohammed married a bunch of women, and was something of a warlord (though he could have been worse). Joseph Smith was just a through-and-through maniac, a product of the Second Great Awakening, the first of which (circa 17th century) created the rest of the so called crazy-American-religious-fuckers. So organized religion doesn't work for me. You can be good without having to live by a book written by medieval minds--in a sense, you hope our world has moved beyond that stage (though, if you look anywhere but CNN, MTV, and FNC, and other assorted fatuous-acronyms, you'll find that hope quietly withering away).

      Columbia has fallen upon such evil days that a man cannot be safe unless he is wicked.  Even those in a position to protest against the perniciousness which they see about them dare not speak lest they make matters worse than before. So the poor are despoiled, the widows sigh, the orphans are oppressed, until many of them, born of families not obscure, and liberally educated, flee to our enemies, flee to the distant, flickering stars, so that they may no longer suffer the oppression of public persecution. Our populace rides our elevators to planets and stars beyond, leaving those too poor and too barbaric to pay our taxes in money darkened by blood.  They leave a Planet in anarchy for a Solar System in upheaval.  They doubtless seek Columbian humanity among the offworlders, because they cannot bear offworlder inhumanity among the Columbians. And although they differ from the people to whom they flee in manner and in language; although they are unlike as regards the fetid odor of the offworlders' bodies and garments and habitations, they would rather endure a foreign civilization among the offworlders than cruel injustice among the Columbians.   So they migrate to feared cities and habitats, such as Bythinia; a mining hovel bathed in Jupiter’s shadow, such as Salutar; one of our many colonies in open revolt, a fester of brigandry, such as any world stained by the Kaedans.  They exile themselves, and do not regret their exile.  For they would rather live free under an appearance of slavery than live as captives under an appearance of liberty.  Such a crisis has not befallen the homeworld since the terror-fecund days of the Exodus, and the Eleven Wars. --Salvator Lin, Introduction to Zeitgeist

      Malcolm’s eyes shuddered, and he felt weakness.  His body was thin, gaunt, wrinkled, straining to support itself on the cold floor he was sprawled upon. His vision was blurred; his surroundings were featureless molds of dark color. He exhaled, stuttered as weakness overwhelmed him, its abruptness like alcohol over an open wound. 	“Telemachus,” he rasped, before recoiling at the sound of his own voice.  “Is this mine?” he asked.  “Is this me?” 	He pulled his brown hands close to his eyes; shut them before they could roam for too long over the wrinkles webbing his skin. 	“Why…what’s happened?” 	Punishment, said the voice beneath his mind.  You tried to escape.  We could not permit that. 	He felt something grasp his arms and legs, a power emanating from his blood vessels.  He was pulled at once to his feet, the force immediately releasing him and   leaving him to slouch, his spine quivering at the effort to hold his weight.  A male figure coalesced from the shroud of featureless images around him, a bare silhouette, its edges palely illuminated by some source he couldn’t identify. 	And yet, said Telemachus, speaking as the silhouette, we allow you to live, and furthermore, we allow you to make a choice. 	The grip straightened him again and walked his legs through the maze of blurs.  He heard a door creak open in front of him, felt the wind on his dry face.  There was a stone balcony overlooking some grand abyss Malcolm couldn’t discern.  He heard Telemachus approach from behind. 	We know what you are, he said.  We know what you could have done, what you were capable of.  Your powers go almost beyond human understanding, or they did, at least. 	Telemachus stepped forward, placed his arms over the railing of the balcony.   But not any more.  You’ve been tamed, after a great deal of surgical and technical work.  You’re nothing more than an old man, now, a feeble shell of something that can never be again.  We left you nothing but your mind, General.  Be thankful for that, at least. 	“What is my choice?” he croaked. 	Live, or die.  Work as a teacher at the Academy of Heirs in Columbia, at the pleasure of His Majesty Botiantes I, and train the next generation of elite.  Advise the most brilliant children in the Empire until they’ve assumed their titles.  You’d be confined to this body until we’d see reason to heal or assist you, of course. 	“Yes?” 	Or jump from this tower and die. 	“I’ve made my decision,” he said, straining to lift himself over the edge of the balcony.  “I spent my whole life being his puppet.  No more.” 	Malcolm winced as his leg went over the railing, contacting nothing but air. He immediately slipped, and felt terror surge inside of him.  He slid away from the balcony; fell into the darkness he could not see, into depths impossible for his blinded eyes to pierce.  Resignation and acceptance approached as his feet parted the air away, as Malcolm prepared for the end. 	His hand caught on the railing, gripped by that power beneath his skin. 	We’ve changed our minds, said Telemachus.  You don’t have a choice.   	Malcolm didn’t know where he was.  He was lying on a couch, of some exotic, opulent fiber, as rich as the skin of a living animal.  He opened his eyes and saw the impossible myriad of blurs once again. 	I’ve had perfect vision my whole life, he thought.  He looked down to his emasculated body, clothed in a simple tunic.  He saw dry skin tightened over thin limbs, a thin chest, a thin body…where, only days ago, it seemed, muscles had rippled there, as if they’d been chiseled into existence by a renaissance-era sculptor. 	No more, he thought. 	He heard a ringing, craned his head to find its source, a piercing sound, metal teeth sliding against metal skin.  The blurs, brown or purple or gold in color, gave him no clue.  Giving up, he shut his eyes, chuckled but then began to cough.  It was the cough of an old man, a long whine from a convulsing chest, climbing through an atrophied throat, exhaled from crinkled lips. 	The whining continued.  He opened his eyes, saw the blurs coalescing into shapes—a burgundy chair here, two cylindrical armrests lining its sides, a bookshelf stuffed with browning historical volumes no one had likely read in hundreds of years, a crimson vine choking a small tree growing out of a pot, a desk, a purple imperial flag hanging next to a window, one of several windows overlooking the unmistakable capital metropolis of Columbia, from thousands of feet in the air.  The city was shrouded in fog, the starscrapers piercing the mists like giant swords. 	“You can see again,” came a baritone voice from behind. 	Who is that?  Malcolm thought, tightening his wrinkled face, I know him from somewhere. 	He turned, winced as pain shot up his back.  Standing in the doorway, before a darkened imperial ballroom, was the Emperor Botiantes.  He was a tall, broad man, with the kind of physique that Malcolm had sported before his body was destroyed.  He was middle-aged but showing signs of his years, his laugh lines deepening into his cherubic face.  He was a handsome man, carved that way by his guarded royal genetics, thick eyebrows, an aquiline nose, but the way his stomach pressed out from his pants, the way his cheeks sagged from his bones suggested that he was letting his body go, that obesity was in this man’s future. 	“I’ve heard that you have little interest in working for me, Thomas.” 	He calls me by my first name, as if we’ve ever been anything more than acquaintances.  “None,” Malcolm said, shaking his head. 	Botiantes stepped forward from the doorway…   	They bothered Alexius, the way they looked at him, the way they watched and whispered, the way they stopped their conversations as he passed.  They were always wearing purple, too, it was always somewhere on their clothes—that strange, lined insignia on their breasts, a tie, an undershirt.  It was a purple that commanded obedience and fixation, dizzying if watched for too long. 	 	He padded down the hallways in his black uniform, his tiny shoes making no sound against the polished marble beneath them.  He noticed that early on, not long after the machines taught him to walk, that he could walk quietly if he wished, while everyone else in the palace clopped against the stone like horses. 	The gentle background of voices dilated to whispers as Alexius strode into one of the great halls, his young body dwarfed by the courtesans and the pillars and the dark statues.  Old men looked up from their screens, exotic women snuck glances over their companions’ shoulders.  Sunlight poured in from the windows, warmed the precious carpets underfoot. 	Alexius stopped, his timorous eyes avoiding theirs. 	“So now you notice?” asked the Praetorian beside him. 	Alexius’ hand bumped against the guard’s fingers.  The guard’s hand swallowed his. 	“There are other ways,” said the guard.  “It’s a big palace.” 	Alexius shook his head. 	“You want to go the normal way?” 	He looked up to the towering man, nodded.  	They bothered Alexius, the way they looked at him, the way they watched and whispered, the way they stopped their conversations as he passed.  They were always wearing purple, too, it was always somewhere on their clothes—that strange, lined insignia on their breasts, a tie, an undershirt.  It was a purple that commanded obedience and fixation, dizzying if watched for too long.

The guard’s hand swallowed his. 	“There are other ways,” said the guard.  “It’s a big palace.” 	Alexius shook his head. 	“You want to go the normal way?” 	He looked up to the towering man, nodded. 	They maneuvered through the throngs of dignitaries and officials and VIPs, Alexius’ interested piqued by a column of black-robed figures shuffling toward the distant main stairwell.  Their faces were obscured by an artificial shadow, and their robes would have been featureless but for the thin, gold diadems wrapped horizontally over their hoods.  Damascenes, said the mechanical voice in his head, here to discuss lucrative shipping privileges with Botiantes himself. They’re as foreign as they look. 	Later, they were walking through more hallways, more royal offices, past more workers and more guards, more humming security spheres, more concealed weapons and more concealed intrigues.  Walking closer to the Empire’s heart.  The intrigue in the building was overpowering, like a tropical humidity, the chatter of voices insufficient to smother the symphony of ambition and cunning chanting through the minds of the courtesans. 	Up another opulent flight of stairs, past larger scanners and intimidating guards, until, finally, they reached a large, black door, almost as reflective as a mirror.  The mechanical voice told him that the golden words engraved on its surface read, OFFICE OF THE GREAT DOMESTIC ISAAC DUCAS 	The Praetorian unclasped the boy’s hand.  “This is where I leave you,” he said, nodding to the door.  “Go on.  He’s waiting.” 	The man inside was tall, and he stood before an enormous window overlooking the entire city as it descended into afternoon, from the distant greenery of Mediterra to the bustling spaceport, into the suburbs, past the outer defenses and turrets, ending in the great wall of churning cloud that stretched on into the horizon. 	The man turned his head, revealing a face deeply ravaged by war and age.   Scars and wrinkles clawed his cheeks, it seemed as if his skin had been rubbed by sandpaper.  The mechanical voice in Alexius’ head told him to bow, so he bowed.  He looked up to see the man smiling. 	“So this is our star student,” he said, walking to him and kneeling to the floor.  “And not even a day of class yet.” 	“I am ready to serve the Harbinger and his Imitator, Botiantes, with all my—” 	Ducas cocked his head, and the mechanical voice was abruptly smothered.  Alexius didn’t know what to say. 	“Let’s dispense with that nonsense,” he said.  “You’re just a kid, you don’t know what you’re saying, what you’re doing.  They shouldn’t have you saying those things at an age like this.” 	Alexius nodded. 	Ducas glanced at the window, then went back to the boy.  “Would you like to  see something?” he asked, his tone giving no hint of practice. 	Alexius smiled. 	The Domestic lead the boy to the window, knelt back down (groaning in the process) and pointed to the distant, churning wall of cloud beyond the city.  “You see that?” he asked.  “Watch it closely.” 	After a time, the clouds began to reveal a series of white flashes, dancing just beneath their skins.  Alexius saw a large formation of what his scanners told him were kataphraktoi fighters, diving into the wall like falcons. 	“It’s a war,” said Ducas, standing back up and falling into the nearby chair.  “A war people have been fighting for thousands of years.  Civitas versus pagus.  City against countryside.  King against constable.  Citizen against barbarian.  They are barbarians,” he said.  “We are citizens.  We are the refined, the sons of America and Europe, heirs to the wealth of their knowledge and fortune.  They are the corrupted, the daughters of Arabia, of Africa, of Asia, people next to animals.  Can you see them?” 	Alexius watched the shadows darting through the distant, flashing clouds. 	“No,” he said, shaking his head. 	“They’ve taken our planet from us, over the course of hundreds of years, person by person, city by city.  Columbia is all that’s left of Earth.  They outnumber us by many times, and they want us dead.  They want to destroy us, to flay us alive, to smash our sacred city.  They want to sink this isle into the sea. 	“And you, Alexius—you and your fellows—are all that will stand between them and us.  There’ll be a day, soon enough, when the Emperor will no longer be able to count on his Domestic, when someone else will have to take over the defense.  These reports I’ve been getting tell me this person is you.” 	Alexius was unfazed.  “All they do is put me through machines.” 	“Have you had any instruction yet?” Ducas asked, lifting a screen and scrolling through the data. 	“Some,” he replied.  “My teachers don’t like me.” 	“Why do you think that is?” 	He paused.  “Well…it’s just that…I know more than they ever could.” 	Ducas guffawed, and pounded the nearby table with his fist.  “So young, and so American!  And what do you know, of life and the world, successor?” 	“Where would you like me to start?” he asked, clicking his jaw together and readying the spools of historic data packed into his flesh. 	“The beginning, of course.” 	Alexius grimaced as he probed further with his mind, searching for the ideas and the people and the events, groping blindly in darkness for what had been there moments ago.  Where was it…what was it?  His eyes went to Ducas. 	The Domestic grinned, grinding the wrinkles on his face together.  He sighed.  “A man once said, all I know is that I know nothing.  Now, what do you know?” 	“What have you done to me?” he asked, stammering, becoming terrified. 	“I’ve taken away what the machines gave you.  All you have left is what you learned on your own.  There isn’t much, is there?  Can you even read?”  The Domestic lifted one of his text screens, showing the symbols to Alexius.  They were completely foreign to him, not a letter was intelligible. 	“I think a greater power than knowledge itself is the ability to take that knowledge away.  Don’t you agree?” 	“Give it back,” he commanded, weakly, unable to remember how to seed his voice with strength, something he thought had come naturally to him.  The child he’d spent his brief life trying to suppress was surfacing, in the form of a surge of emotion in his chest. 	“Make a promise.” 	Alexius nodded, trying to hold back the tears. 	“Promise me you’ll listen to people, learn from people and from things, instead of suckling like an infant from the stuff they’ve crammed into your head.  It isn’t real.  You’ve got to see things with your own eyes.  I mean, learn, really take it in.  Beyond your experience, you have no identity.” 	“I promise.” 	The knowledge came tumbling back, enough to briefly overwhelm him, his eyes dilating as if bereft of life.  He regained control of himself, felt the welling panic and the idiotic child suppressed beneath his intelligence. 	“Now, on to other things.  You know of the position the Empire holds on the international level?” 	“A weak one,” Alexius replied. 	Ducas nodded.  “Botiantes’ has taken back some of our holdings on Mars and Venus, but it’s nothing like what we used to have.  We used to have everything.  But we still have enough riches to crave, enough glory to tempt the barbarians beyond our borders.  Our navy is still unchallenged, our army is the best trained in the system.  Why, do you think, we have so little of what our ancestors conquered?” 	Alexius grinned.  “We’re outnumbered.” 	“Exactly.  Whoever didn’t die during the Eleven Wars and the Conquests was scattered into the Exodus.  It’s hard to believe this place once had more than a billion people.  Now, we have trouble filling the only city on the planet.  Why don’t people want to live here, in this beautiful paradise, the only place with free water and free oxygen, with land so cheap it’s practically free?  And don’t quote the historians you’ve got packed in there.  Tell me what you actually think.” 	“Barbarians,” he replied.  “No security.  No police.” 	Ducas scoffed.  “We’ve got more security in Columbia than any other city in the System!” 	“Well, I meant, outside the city.” 	He shook his head.  “Think.” 	Alexius didn’t know. 	“We’ll have to fix that.  Your teachers are good, they’re the best there are, but they’re letting you get away with far too much.  We’ve got to wean you off this dependence you have.” 	You’re four years old, said the mechanical voice, he doesn’t remember what it’s like to be four.  He’s an old man, doddering, just waiting for a coup.  You don’t have to listen to him—” 	“And we’ll be replacing that thoughtwriter of yours as well.  Now, would you like to know, and remember, why no one wants to live on Earth?” 	The child eagerly nodded, and the knowledge cringed. 	“They remember,” he said, his eyes going back to the battle in the clouds. 	Alexius waited, and watched the man’s eyes wriggle as they plotted the battle in the distance, the cruisers and the kataphracts plunging into the rolling flashes.  The man mumbled something, turned in his chair, his mind obviously elsewhere.  Alexius could do nothing but watch. 	“I’m sorry, boy,” he said, abruptly, “but you’ll have to go.  Something’s come up.  We’ll continue this later.” 	The same praetorian stepped in from the distant door, motioning with his hand for Alexius to come.  The child took one last, amazed look at the distant battle, and saw the huge gun turrets at the edge of Columbia craning their nozzles to the sky.  He watched for too long, though, his fascination overcoming him, and he barely noticed the enormous, dark hand take his own and lead him away from the Domestic’s office.  The knowledge was furious, chastising the child with words it had never heard before. 	“They say it isn’t safe here,” murmured the praetorian as they descended a marble tongue of stairs.  The enormous halls had been emptied of the courtesans and the diplomats, the sunstained windows darkened by metal shielding.  The place was only frequented by columns of jogging, black-armored kataphraktoi, taking positions, said the mechanical voice, declining to say any more. 	“We have to go down to the bottom,” said the guard, as they entered one of the outside elevators. 	“The bottom?” he asked, his hand unconsciously tightening its grip on the praetorian’s. 	“That’s where everyone else is.  It’s safe there.”  The guard saw that the boy was afraid, though.  “There’s nothing to worry about,” he said, unable to think of anything more that would solace the child.  They never trained me for this, he thought. 	Alexius leaned against the glass window of the elevator, looked outside to the diminishing day.  A white fingernail crescent hung in a distant corner of the sky, a pink streak of cloud gashed nearby as if by the claw of an enraged monster.  The sun sunk deeper beneath the horizon, flushing the scar to a darker hue, and as fear welled in his chest the superstitious child beneath the knowledge forced Alexius’ eyes away.  The elevator began to slide past the pillars and minarets of Sophia Palace, as it drew closer to the bottom the structure widened into domes and arches and pavilions, now packed with the city’s anxious inhabitants.  It was late, and Columbia’s surfaces had reddened, left drenched by the sunset’s blood. 	The skylanes were empty for the first time that Alexius had ever seen, the thousands of ships and freighters that usually crowded the air forced to the rooftops and causeways from threat of attack.  They nestled among the sallied populace like gigantic insects, alighting upon thin legs as wearied dragonflies would. 	Though the city had never been very bright during the evening none of its residential lights were on now—the starscrapers and edifices had slipped from unconsciousness, the power diverted to the vigilant defense turrets and their targeting systems.  Even from the lofty height Alexius and the praetorian occupied the cannons could be seen activating one by one, rising from their slumbers and swinging their arms toward that distant scar of cloud.  The elevator groaned before coming to a total stop. 	The praetorian groaned, rubbed his forehead.  “Too late.  They drained up all the power.” 	Alexius’ eyes were diverted by an arrow of shadows flowing over the city, lifting and dropping like curtains over Columbia’s structures.  Formations of black kataphracts had assembled into a thick phalanx in the burning bowl of the sky, a swarm of jagged metal wheeling over and around the taller spires of the city like a flock of sparrows. 	They swept past Sophia palace, angrily rattling the elevator’s windows.   Alexius shrunk back into the purple robes of the praetorian as the floor trembled beneath his feet, and the man held his shoulders, vainly trying to conceal his own terror.  The guard suddenly realized how much he hated the palace, how much he hated being afraid of falling to his death.  He gritted his teeth, tightened the grip on Alexius’ shoulders, and glared angrily at the distant city depths, cursing himself and the emperor and the child and the academy in his mind, unable to calm himself as the kataphracts tore past the elevator mere feet away.  He would kiss the city pavement the moment he got there. 	As the last of the dark blurs passed the praetorian calmed himself, pushing the terror into the back of his mind.  He relaxed his muscles, let Alexius go.  The child scampered to the steadied window, lifted himself up on the handrails to watch the kataphracts as they roared away from the bounds of the city, headed for the bloody gash of cloud near the moon’s brightening crescent. 	NOTE: gash of cloud comes off of cloud wall, hehe. 	Flashes broke out near the cloud’s skin as the kataphracts were reduced to thin, weaving dots.  After a time they darkened, Alexius’ eyes as bright with wonder as those of the rest of the city, the inhabitants thinking of themselves as no more than spectators, settling down outside for a gentle night of fireworks.
