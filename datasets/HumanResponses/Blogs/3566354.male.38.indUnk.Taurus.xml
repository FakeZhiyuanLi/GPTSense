      Lookit! I'm an official artist. There's a website that says so:   urlLink http://www.artistrunway.com   ...and if it's on the web, it must be true, right?  If you'd like to skip the fancy flash animation at the beginning, you can go directly to the artist's profile page here:    urlLink http://www.artistrunway.com/collector/our_artists.aspx   This is a new website set up by a couple of adventurous interior designers who are looking to provide original artwork to other interior decorators...or anyone else for that matter.  I should be listed in the "Commissioned Artists" section before too long also, so if you know someone willing to pay through the nose for a commissioned work, by all means refer them to this site. Paying through other bodily orifices will be subject to some sort of approval process, I'm sure.

      My wife and I took our five-year-old daughter to the newest Harry Potter movie over the weekend. I was a little concerned about her possible reaction to some of the scarier parts, but she seemed to handle them pretty well and enjoyed the movie.  I am curious about her tolerance for horror though. I think we’ll sit her down for  The Exorcist  next. Maybe even Jerry Springer.  There was a part of the movie (and if you haven’t seen it yet, you better just cover your eyes for the rest of this sentence) where Harry and Hermione go back in time using a magic timepiece and view and affect their own actions earlier in the day. (OK, you can stop covering your eyes now.) I wanted to know what my daughter’s take on that particular bit had been.   It had to have been confusing for her, since most preschool classes don’t tend to concentrate on paradoxes within the time-space continuum, nor had she ever had the chance to view the most basic primer on  temporal continuity manipulation–by which, of course, I refer to  Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure .   When asked, she didn’t indicate that she understood that the characters went back in time, so much as she believed there were magical doubles of Harry and Hermione running about during the course of your standard linearly-arranged day.   Well, surely good ol’ Dad could clear this right up. “No, hon, “I started. ”It’s like when you…”   When you what?   Have the same day over and over again? No, that’s just called  employment .   Do something and then see yourself doing it again, only the second time you aren’t doing the same thing that you were doing the first time, but the thing that you are doing that isn’t the same as what you were doing before happens at the same time as the thing that you were doing before? Sure, it sounds simple enough, but somehow I needed to work Barbie into it so she’d have something to relate to.  In the end, I just decided that maybe I’d let her draw her own conclusions. Anyway, the only actual time travel I’ve seen only occurs when you put instant coffee in a microwave, otherwise it’s all theory and complicated chalk drawings.  I’ll save my energy for complex explanations later in life, like why she can’t go for a ride with Earl the trucker.

      ...just in case you missed it.  I overheard two people talking at work today. One was remarking on how fitting it was that Reagan had died on the anniversary of D-Day.  "How so?" asked the other. "Because of his service during the war," replied the first.  Now correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe Reagan was an  actor  during the war. He made  movies  about it. He didn't actually do any fighting in it.   Granted, you could make some weak attempt at a correlation, but the same sort of tenuous connection could be made if Ned Beatty had died during National Pork Awareness Week.

      All too often, those things we did in the past have a way of coming back to haunt us.  urlLink Case in point.   Fishheads was an experiment in gauging the extent of the untapped wellspring of Indianapolis humor.   No, really!   Surprisingly, our magazine got us a bit of local media attention. This may not be an indicator so much of our talent as a dearth of newsworthy events in this town. We had a couple of write-ups in the  Indianapolis Star , an article in  Indianapolis Monthly , several radio appearances on the local airwaves, and a televised profile on the local FOX station when our publication came to an end.  For years afterwards, I would run into people who read and were polite enough to say they enjoyed reading the magazine. Then, of course, they would make the sign of the cross and back away slowly. Some of the more forgiving sort of the aforementioned previous readers asked if we were going to do a web version of our magazine.  This was the early nineties. "The web?" I'd say. "Pshaw...like that'll ever take off!" --thus demonstrating the business acumen for which I am well-known.  Now, thanks to a fine young man who apparently found a few old issues used as packing material, some of that content has made it to the web. I'd like to thank Mr. Clean (the owner of the site--I'm guessing that's not his real name) for his effort and appreciation, as well as express some envy on his apparent wealth of free time.

      My name is Brian Hendrickson. I am an Indianapolis based artist/illustrator and frequent proponent of viewpoints unfettered by such trivialities as logic or civility. I make no claims that what I will write will be either interesting or relevant to you or the world at large.   Now that your expectations have been properly lowered, welcome! This is my first-ever foray into the blogging world. My interests include (but are certainly not limited to) martial arts --particularly aikido, and even more particularly Yoshinkan aikido; art and illustration in both digital and traditional media, movies, hiking, camping, science fiction, non-science fiction, history, and making fun of the Amish.

      The Inter-Dimensional House of Pancakes transcends the barriers of space and time.   In&nbsp;less doofus-centric terms, this means check out the  urlLink original cartoon , circa 1992,&nbsp;that inspired the title of this blog.

      Let's say for some reason(like perhaps a dramatic population increase in large prehistoric carnivores), that modern society fragments into small tribal groups. I'm wondering what remnants of today's technological wonderland would be retained in the oral and ceremonial traditions of the future tribes.   Picture tomorrow's noble savage, stalking through the overgrown jungles of suburbia. His face, painted with white-out and highlighter marker, is a riot of designs and patterns derived from Nike and McDonalds logos. He wears a necklace made of strung computer semi-conductors, MGD bottle caps, and Lego bricks.   He carries a spear made by mounting a Ginsu knife to an aluminum curtain rod with wound strands of mint-flavored dental floss. His preferred weapon, however, is a PVC pipe blowgun that shoots pushpins coated with Vick's Deep Heating Rub. The pushpins don't really kill anything, but they sure do sting.   Our savage has a long scar along his chin -- a visible reminder of his tribal name, Runs-with-Scissors. The young man is a respected member of the tribe and holds the honorary title of "Assistant Manager". His father, a pock-marked tribal elder named Can't-eat-with-a-fork, sits on the tribal council as "Regional Sales Manager".   The tribe holds elaborate annual festivals that have origins in the mysterious past. There is "Carburation Day" in which the participants get rip-roaring drunk and run around in a big left-turn-only circle. Another popular holiday is "Celebrity Day" where the most vapid member of the tribe is followed around and imitated constantly. The somber ceremony, "Jump the Shark Day", marks the death of technological civilization with the ritual moaning of  We Built This City (On Rock and Roll)  and the wailing of  Domo Arigato Mr. Roboto .   I'm looking forward to it. In fact, I'm going to go ahead and come up with my own tribal name. Currently I'm torn between "Gripes-all-the-time" and "Dangerous-with-stapler."&nbsp; &nbsp;

      I've always had a fascination with the prehistoric animals of the Pleistocene period. ( urlLink Here , by the way is a great resource.) These are the megafauna, the huge mammals such as the  urlLink saber-toothed cat ,  urlLink wooly mammoth ,  urlLink giant sloth ,  and the freaky-looking  urlLink chalicothere . What really intrigues me about them is that there were humans walking around at the same time as these critters.   On numerous occasions, I have stepped outside to put trash in our outside bin, in the dark, and come face-to-face with our local opossum. On these occasions, I typically blurt out expletives and/or multi-cultural blasphemies while simultaneously performing a dramatic backwards leap. I sometimes wonder how this reaction would be intensified if the Brian/opossum size ratio were adjusted to look like this:     Now that would certainly liven up your otherwise drab Wednesday evening, right?  I envy primitive man for this reason. Sure, some of the creatures would eat you if given the chance and there were likely many early Americans that wound up as pasty bits between wooly mammoth toenails...but they lived in that time when meeting  urlLink King Kong  was actually possible. It was a real-life, and mostly real-dangerous,  Where the Wild Things Are .  That being said, there are numerous reasons why I DON'T envy primitive man -- modern medicine, dentistry, chee-tos, and Guinness being sterling examples.   So, to sum up.. Monsters: cool Dying from gangrenous infection: not cool.  What we need, then, are monsters in modern society. I'm not talking serial killers or terrorists (yawn!), I'm talking honking-big creatures with fur and fangs that live among us, eating either each other or those humans too dull-witted to not notice their thunderous approach. This, as I see it, would have numerous beneficial effects for the American public:  1. General health improvement -all the running lets everyone shed unwanted pounds, diminished lung capacity of smokers makes them likely to be picked off early.  2. Improved employment outlook -turnover would be decent in almost every employment sector. Lawyers, believe it or not, taste just the same as gas station attendants.  3. Reduces size of government and government spending --Actually, look for a reduction in most societal organizations due to diminshing membership.  4. Cleans up the environment --this conclusion is easily arrived at if you consider the following: Humans will tend to band together using the logic of "safety in numbers." This should reduce the current trend towards urban sprawl when the human population begins to concentrate more towards the city centers out of necessity. Suburban population density tends to make the more isolated individuals easier pickings.   Furthermore, the tendency of humans to travel in armed bands coupled with the dubious safety of passenger vehicles will make mass transit systems more viable. An   urlLink indricothere , for instance, is large enough to squash even the most sturdily-built HumVee (take THAT you gas-guzzling, war-glorifying, affluence-flaunting, vehicular manifestation of penis envy!)  Thus: Fewer vehicles=reduced vehicular emissions=cleaner air.  And for that matter: Fewer people=fewer polluters  Frankly, I'm sold on the idea. I mean, what could go wrong?  I'm still working out the logistics of how to bring back the megafauna, surely something along the lines of the DNA extraction and propagation methods demonstrated in Jurassic Park is an option, or perhaps more simply genetic manipulation of living species to monstrous proportions.   As a courtesy, I'll be sure to announce when I'm set to unleash my monstrous experiments upon the unsuspecting public. Be sure to check back frequently!
