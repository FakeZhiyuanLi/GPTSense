       We put the second coat of lime green paint on my wall this morning and I'm happy to report that my parentals were right and the second coat fixed it, and it looks really good! Now my room smells like paint fumes pretty badly so I'm stuck on the couch again for tonight. Which really bites because it's extremely uncomfortable and I don't get much sleep. Oh well. Not sleeping allows me to post all of these interesting posts for people to read.       I watched the olympics tonight. I'm really glad Carly Patterson won the women gymnastic's all around. She deserved it. The silver medalist ( would type her name, but I can't pronounce it let alone spell it) was so arrogant and just not very friendly. I didn't like her very much. I felt really bad for the Russian that got 4th place. I hate it when they show the girls crying when they just barely miss a medal. But anyway I wish I could tumble and twist my body into a knot like those crazy people. It's absolutely amazing the insane tumbling they do. I could sit and watch it for hours and not get bored.       I decided I don't like swimming. They kept interrupting they gymnastics with the swimming. I'm proud of Michael Phelps and the other people and all, but interuptting the gymnasts as much as they did was ridiculous. And the stupid commentators make me want to throw my television out the window.       Speaking of my television it cracks me up. It randomly convulses and turns it self off whenever it wants to. It's hilarious especially when people come over and they don't know that my tv has issues. It cracks me up. It's great personal entertainment.       Well I can't think of anything else to that's it for now.      Jesus loves you!

       I feel like ranting because I'm irritated and I can't sleep while I'm irritated so maybe typing about this will help me be able to sleep.       First let me explain about the dance team type thing I'm on called City Starz. I love it and I've learned how to really dance and all that there, but I'm not very happy with my choreographer right now. We had our show Monday and Tuesday. Monday sucked, but Tuesday was absolutely amazing.  Anyway, none of us have heard from our director/choreographer since. Rumor has it this was the last year for it and I'd really like to know because I hate having to wonder about stuff I'd rather just know. Plus this group has been a huge part of my life so I wanna know. But that made no sense to anyone who doesn't understand all the City Starz drama I have in my life.      Which brings me to rant #2. I hate drama. I truly hate it. It's stupid and the people who cause it are stupid. Which brings me to      Rant #3.  People who already have a ton of problems shouldn't date. Not only will they screw themselves over even more with all the drama they already have they will screw over the girl they decided they want to dump their drama on. GRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That angers me..... a lot. But I'm not bitter about it really.      Rant #4 Whoever invented IB Proufen should've done a better job. I have to take 4 of those pills to make them work and then Messy gets all crazy telling me I'm addicted. And she's probably right as usual.  So now I've had to switch to migran liquid advil and you can only have 2 every 24 hours!!! That's insane!!!!!!! I need 6 ever 12 hours. But that's ok. Because I'm a good kid and I still follow the instructions on the back don't worry I'm not a crazy drug addict I promise.      Rant #5 I hate school and it starts in three days. That makes me want to start playing with matches. Or accidently getting on a plane, flying to Colorado, and living in the snow. Except now i hate snow and I love sunny weather. Oh well. Living in the snow beats going back to that place.       My head is all up in knots from ranting so I can't think of anything else, but don't worry if I think of more I'll post them.       That's all for now.      Jesus loves you!

       This is kinda cool. It's definitely only for my personal entertainment so just warning you now, if anyone even reads this cause I'm kinda thinking Messy will be the only one. But anyway, school starts in 3 days and I'm not ok with it. I hate school. Walking into that buliding makes my stomach all queasy and I get migranes. I think I should be allowed to hibernate through the supposed "best days of my life". Oh well, at least Messy will be there to help pull me through.      I've been thinking a lot about faith and God lately. I mean I'm a Christian I was saved in December, but this whole faith thing is really really difficult. I'm doing this devotion thing called the seven checkpoints, and I've never had to think so hard in my life. It's really pointing out how weak my faith is, and how little I trust God to actually do what he says. It's kind of strange. I hate having to get all in depth and stuff with people. I'm pretty sure that's why I struggle in my relationship with God a lot. Trusting God and all that sounds so easy, but actually applying it to my life and living it out is a whole other story.       I went to the fair today and worked at the booth that IBSA set up. They were giving away "good news" bracelets. You know the kind with the green bead for creation, black for sin, red for Jesus's blood, white for salvation, blue for baptisim, and gold for heaven. So I got to help some kids make some and explain it to them and it was pretty awesome. There was an adult lady there that was kind of bitter, and said she absolutely didn't want one, but then I went through it with a little boy and she watched me and come over and asked for a bracelet and brochure. I thought that was kinda cool. Especially since when people get all hard hearted like that it makes me really upset.       Oh yeah! Today I painted my room lime green! The color is tight, but the first coat is beyond frightening looking. My mom keeps telling me the second coat will look better, and since I didn't believe her she got my dad trying to convince me so let's just say I hope they're both right. Second coat goes on tomorrow so I'm way excited to see what it will look like done.       That's it for now!      Jesus loves you!
