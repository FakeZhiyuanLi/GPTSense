      As you read this editorial, PetroChina, the state-owned petroleum company of the People’s Republic of China, is hacking into the Tibetan landscape to lay a 973-kilometer oil pipeline. Although the Chinese government describes their drilling for fuel as essential to the economic development of the region (a region not even rightfully under their control), the Tibetan Pipeline plan has clearly political ramifications. Meanwhile, a cell-phone’s throw away from our beloved Boston University, bureaucrats and businessmen are licking their chops as they inspect the blueprints of the proposed gazillion-dollar Red Sox megaplex. Not only are state and city tax dollars supporting a private enterprise, but the new ballpark will require taking over productive Boston businesses through eminent domain.     These so-called “infrastructural developments” are detrimental to the lives of the inhabitants. China is not just capitalizing on the natural resources of “their” western regions, they are escalating their ongoing strategy of consolidating power in the region that they unlawfully invaded in 1949 and have occupied ever since. Mayor Menino and company are not trying to entice tourists but rather are protecting their political allies in the financial sector. Approval of the new stadium gives wealthy owners and developers the freedom to make as much money as they can, regardless of who is harmed in the process, which breaks all the rules of common sense and moral justice.      Cries for freedom by the Tibetan people have been silenced by the Chinese government through imprisonment, torture, and execution because these “dissidents” supposedly threaten the security of the Chinese state. (It is apparently of no interest to them that the Buddhist leader of the Tibetan people, His Holiness the Dalai Lama, has repeatedly denounced any use of violence.) The voices of the Tibetans are not being heard.    In a somewhat analogous (although far less violent) situation, the newly-established, Mayor Menino-appointed Fenway Task Force has seventeen members, fourteen of whom are pro-Fenway businessmen who seek to benefit from the project, while only three are grass-roots neighborhood activists opposed to the plan. Is this ratio reflective of the attitudes of the community? . . . of course not. These appointments clearly reaffirm yet again that the only opinions that matter are those that are backed by the bucks.  One Green Monster is being traded for another.  We should support the residents of the Fenway neighborhood and the Tibetan people in their struggle for self-determination. The Students for a Free Tibet are not fighting a pipeline. The members of the Boston University Youth Alliance for Housing are not disputing a baseball stadium. They are trying to throw a wrench into the whirring gears of the political machines of the Chinese government and the Boston City Council, respectively. These are battles for political autonomy.       Originally appeared in the  Daily Free Press  (Boston, Mass.) in April 2001

      We go through about a roll of fax paper each week here at the newspaper. Baseball scores, obituaries, birth announcements, and press releases of all sorts pile in every day.  And about once a week, we get a friendly update from our state senators and assembly members. And about once a week, Pete and I  shake our heads and roll our eyes and sigh exasperatedly, because the one fax for which we wait with bated breath never seems to come in.  To be painfully blunt, I don't want to see any more junk from our state representatives about meth labs and venison donation programs until we have a budget and meaningful Medicaid reform.  Illicit drug use is a serious problem in our society, and I'm glad that someone cares enough to address the issue. Likewise, I think the idea of utilizing every slain animal to its fullest extent (just as the Native Americans did) to help those less fortunate is a great idea.  But like emergency medical personnel, our legislators need to triage. We have a legislative ER in which hangnails and stubbed toes are treated first while bleeding head gashes and severed limbs wait in the lobby. The amputees and the cranial lacerations require more skill and certainly more time to resolve, but it only makes sense to deal with the most acute problems first.  Fortunately, at least some of the state's legislators are self-aware enough to see the speck - and the plank - in their own eyes. About a month and a half ago the Democrat and Chronicle ran a story about the agonizingly slow pace of this year's legislative session. Democrats and Republicans from upstate and downstate bemoaned the legislature's meager accomplishments in the 2004 session.  According to the story, only 46 bills had become law while assembly members had adopted nearly 2,200 resolutions and senators had adopted nearly 5,000. It's difficult to find these resolutions because, perhaps not surprisingly, most legislators do not post them on their websites (at least not conspicuously). Senator John DeFrancisco (R-I-C, Syracuse), has, however, bravely listed on his site the resolutions that he sponsored and the New York State Senate unanimously passed in May of this year, among them Resolution No. 4831, which honors Kenneth A. Shaw, Ph.D., "upon the occasion of his retirement after 13 distinguished years as Chancellor of Syracuse University." Similarly, Resolution No. 5155 congratulates the "2003-2004 Baldwinsville varsity hockey team for having been named New York State Public High School Athletic Association's State Scholar Athlete State Champions for Ice Hockey." Wow.  While I am sure that Dr. Shaw is a fine human being and a stellar university administrator and the Baldwinsville hockey team is a group of outstanding young people, I find it hard to believe that the need to give them a slap on the back could possibly trump Medicaid reform, a state budget, and a resolution to the Campaign for Fiscal Equity-inspired, court-ordered educational reform initiative, among many other pressing concerns.  I say, let's forego the political slivers, indigestion, earaches, and minor abrasions for the systematic congestive heart failures, aneurisms, and collapsed lungs. There's too much at stake to let them wait around in the lobby.   Originally appeared in the  Genesee Country Express  on June 17, 2004

      Sometimes I wonder if there might be a silver lining to our present economic troubles.  With the exception of the insidious Bush tax cuts that take from the working class and give to the rich (what Princeton economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman calls "Dooh Nibor economics" for its Robin Hood-in-reverse ethos) and which only serve to feed an already gluttonous corporate class, the current recession might just be the kick in the pants that my generation needs.  In lean economic times, young people will (hopefully) realize that they need to stay in school. In order to enjoy the lifestyle that MTV dreams are made of, they need to commit themselves to their education. The stakes for screwing up are higher and the cushion is thinner.  Whether it be in veterinary medicine, accounting, HVAC, or food service, they need to be well-trained if they are going to get and keep a job. Workers with 20 years of experience in high-tech manufacturing, excellent attendance records, and bachelors degrees are getting laid off; how can a 17-year-old high school drop-out expect to fare well in this economy?  American youth don't drop out of school for the same reasons that they did 40 years ago. There are no more factories or farms that hire 16-year-old kids that need to support their families. Kids drop out nowadays because they have no hope for the future: they are depressed, angry at the world, and feel useless and discouraged.  And in many ways, being depressed, angry at the world, and feeling useless are luxuries that only the youth of first-world nations can afford. In fact, 95 percent of the world's twenty-somethings would give their eye teeth for the opportunity to sit around and complain about feeling disenchanted.  Young people in developing countries wouldn't dare drop out of school; such an act would essentially relegate them to abject poverty. In the Ukraine and Thailand and Brazil, brilliant people with university degrees work as store clerks, so the likelihood that anyone can make a decent living without a high school diploma is nil.  On a recent vacation out west I toured America's civil engineering masterpiece, the Hoover Dam. Setting aside the sheer size of the structure and the volume of water that it controls and electricity it generates, the most striking aspect of the dam was the human one.  The dam was built in hard times, when people were desperate for work, desperate enough to work shirtless (and without sunscreen!) in the desert in the middle of the summer. Those "powder monkeys" repelled down the Colorado River canyon sitting on just thin wooden planks without safety harnesses, shoving black powder into the crevices of the rock. They knew that if they quit, if the work was too hard and the weather too unbearable and the stress too much to handle, that hundreds of men were camped out in front of the town's train depot just waiting to take their spot and their paycheck.  While our current recession looks like a cockroach compared to the leviathan of the 1930s, I hope that my generation can at least learn a lesson from all of this. Instead of getting mad about making $5 an hour, channel that energy into staying in school and doing well.   Originally appeared in the  Genesee Country Express  on June 10, 2004

      Robert Zoelick is conceivably the most powerful man in America. I am exaggerating only slightly when I say that this man has our fates in the palm of his hand. He has, arguably, changed the economic and psychological color of Upstate New York more than any other public official in the past decade.  But sadly, most Americans don't even know who he is.  Zoelick, the United States trade representative, was our chief negotiator in Seattle, Quebec City, Genoa, Cancun, and Porto Allegre, to name a few.  Like Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Zoelick wields an enormous amount of power and We the People have virtually no say in his appointment. As is the case for countless other directors, judges, and Cabinet members, Congress has only a "yes" or "no" vote on their appointments.  Too often, editorialists - from our humble publication to the likes of The New York Times - fill their op-ed pages with columns and columns of rants, gripes, criticisms, and ideological musings. Rarely do they provide tangible solutions to the problems that they analyze. But let me give it to you straight up: we need to elect our trade representative.  With an election comes the risk of hanging and dimpled chads, but with an election also comes much-needed accountability. At a time when international trade and economic cooperation are at the fore of our political and social agenda, our trade representative needs to be front and center, too.  "Free trade" isn't free at all; it's heavily regulated - to ensure maximum profits for corporate executives and minimal interference from anyone else.  All the profits from "free trade" go into the hands of transnational corporations who've invested millions in off-shore production. The executives of these corporations, like Henry Pulson, CEO of Goldman Sachs, or Sanford Weill, CEO of Citigroup, are obscenely wealthy, earning  upwards of $252,000 an hour. These corporations aren't "international" or even "multinational" any more: they have lost any national identity or attachment, have transcended nationalism, and now live in their own stratosphere entirely independent of national boundaries - and regulation.  You don't need me to tell you that Americans not making out well on this, and neither are the struggling citizens of third-world nations. With ten years of NAFTA behind them, half of all Mexicans are still living in poverty. Real wages have in fact fallen a breathtaking 72 percent in the last 10 years.  But it's time to pay attention to the man behind the curtain. Let's march to the Emerald City that he's built with the billions of greenbacks from the lay-offs at Kodak and Xerox and Bausch and Lomb and AC Delco and Gleason and Foster Wheeler. Let's hold Zoelick up to public scrutiny.   Originally appeared in the  Genesee Country Express  on May 13, 2004

      Volunteering is a wonderful thing, and I'm thrilled that my generation has seized upon this trend with such zeal.  Studies have shown that between 60 and 70 percent of young Americans between the ages of 18 and 25 regularly volunteer. There aren't enough soup kitchens to accommodate all the high school and college students wanting to volunteer. Ironically, we don't vote (a diatribe for another day), but when it comes to the giving of our time and energy for the greater good, we get an A+ in civic participation.  But despite such overwhelming support for civic and charitable service organizations, I'm not convinced that the quality of life for the collective masses of the poor, down-trodden, and/or at-risk has improved at all in the last decade.  I believe that we have become so entrenched in organized do-gooding that we don't have time to be kind to the people closest to us. We tend to eschew the kinds of relationships that really make a difference. We don't want to become friends with someone who's terminally ill or disabled  or uneducated or addicted. We want to come by once a month or perhaps a few times a year, pass out cookies and punch and play party games, and go home again. We want photo opportunities, not meaningful change in their lives or ours.  Somehow, somewhere, we all acquired this notion that our good deeds don't count if they aren't sanctioned and supervised by a public entity. Perhaps it's our collective obsession with resume-building; we can't put "raked elderly neighbor's leaves" or "sat and talked over a cup of coffee with a discouraged single parent" on our curriculum vitae unless it was under the auspices of the Scouts or Compeer or Catholic Charities. Maybe it's our cultural yen for ego-stroking and self-esteem building ("I am a good person, really I am; look at all the nice things I do.")  Our civic service and non-profit organizations are vital, invaluable aspects of our community and I applaud them for mobilizing us to identify and rectify the problems that plague our society. But their work is inchoate without individual, sincere acts of giving, acts that require sacrifice - not just of a couple of hours of television - and perhaps more importantly, risk-taking.

      I fully subscribe to the notion that our schools get all the money they need and the Air Force throws a bake sale to buy a bomber. I cheered when the state Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Campaign for Fiscal Equity, a New York City-based non-profit coalition of parent organizations, community school boards, concerned citizens, and advocacy groups that fought to reform the state's school finance system to ensure adequate resources for all students in New York City. "Three cheers for grassroots activism!" I whooped. "Yes, finally, there is hope for the quagmire that is the New York City public school system!" I said to anyone who would listen.  But now that the Zarb Commission - charged with the task of determining the fiscal ramifications of the CFE decision on the state budget - has been convened and the CFE has also weighed in on the issue and their reports are piling in, I have this irksome and recurring thought: there's something fundamentally askew with the notion that we can directly correlate educational quality with money.  The purpose of the CFE's New York State Adequacy Study was to determine "the cost of providing all New York State public school students a full opportunity to meet the Regents learning standards." According to the study, setting aside transportation costs and debt service, public schools in New York State spent about $31.71 billion in 2001-2002 to educate  students. The study suggests that an additional $6.21 to $8.4 billion would have been necessary in the same schools in the same time frame to ensure a "full opportunity to meet the Regents Learning Standards for all students."  The CFE study calls for the state to outlay approximately $10 billion over the next four years. The Zarb Commission (perhaps not surprisingly) came up with a much lower estimate of between $2.5 and $5.6 billion - still a breathtaking sum by all accounts.  First of all, I'm not convinced that the new Regents Learning Standards measure much of anything, but what struck me as the real crux of the report was the little footnote on page 3: "It must be recognized that the success of schools also depends on other individuals and institutions to provide the health, intellectual stimulus, and family support upon which public school systems can build. Schools cannot and do not perform their role in a vacuum, and this is an important qualification of any study of adequacy in education."  For two years I lived in a developing country and taught in a public secondary school. The nineteenth-century stone building had high ceilings and single-pane windows and the heating system was largely ineffectual, if functional at all. Romania has a climate much like that of Upstate New York, with stretches of several months when it was so cold in school that my students had to wear hats and mittens and wool coats in class. I have a pair of black gloves with chalky-white fingertips because I couldn't take my gloves off and still write on the blackboard. We had no textbooks. If a teacher did use a textbook, the students had to buy them at local bookstores. The students had no band or orchestra, no school auditorium for a drama club to use, no sports facilities, no school cafeteria. They brought sandwiches from home and ate them during their breaks. During gym class they played soccer in the back courtyard.   Romanian high-schoolers, however, study two foreign languages and by the ninth grade are nearly fluent in both. High-school sophomores and juniors do college-level mathematics and physics, and my seventh-graders could easily master the Math A and probably even the Math B, C, or D Regents exams. Why? Because they lived in an environment that demanded perfection.   Romanian teachers are tough, perhaps too tough, and don't accept excuses. They rule their classrooms with an iron fist. Their word is final and carries tremendous authority. There is no such thing as detention or ISS in Romanian secondary school because it is simply not needed.  Does our higher standard of "educational living" produce a higher caliber of student? I think not.  I think our local school districts are doing an admirable job and my critique is not of the leadership of Dansville or Wayland-Cohocton or Keshequa, or Brighton or McQuaid, for that matter. It's about the system.  People, particularly Americans, value aesthetics. Americans have a preoccupation with stuff and tend not to dwell on substance. We like things, particularly facilities, to be new and attractive and if they aren't we raze them and start over.  I fear that many taxpayers see a big school, a pretty school, and assume that the educational quality matches the quality of the facility. Such is not always the case. There's more to school than stuff. Just as many disfunctional families living in beautiful, spacious houses with manicured lawns, marble countertops, and Ethan Allen furniture, many a high school graduate has fled the doors of their state-of-the-art school ill-prepared for the realities of college and the working world.  The Campaign for Fiscal Equity is redressing, albeit on a rather small scale, the ever-widening gap between the haves and the have-nots in our supposedly egalitarian society. The spirit of their legal challenge was not to promote uber-socialism or remove agency from the kids and parents, but to hold the government accountable for true equity - not where the most votes come, not where the campaign funding comes from, not where the private corporate interests live, but where it's needed.  Do I want to take away the heat and hot water, the textbooks and computers, out of our schools?  Definitely not. But I also believe that throwing money at something does not fix it. Money doesn't buy happiness or love, and it doesn't buy academic success. Giving kids all the help they need to succeed costs money - a lot of money - but it won't do it alone.

      With yet another uber-commercial holiday upon us, I must publicly bemoan the preponderance of plastic packaging.  I know that the problem of boundless non-decomposable trash has plagued us for years and I have jumped on to the editorial bandwagon far too late, but sometimes it takes a while before a tangible reality really hits you in the head.  This Christmas I purchased a memory card for a digital camera from your favorite photographic supply manufacturer and mine. The object was literally the size of a postage stamp yet bundled in a plastic casing the size of a phone book - no exaggeration.  In the aftermath of Christmas morning, as I stood amidst the rubble of wrapping paper, ribbon, and polymerized packaging, I couldn't help but think that this synthetically-swathed memory card was somehow representative of our society as a whole: only a little bit of substance and a whole lot of trash . . . but that's another column for another day.  I realize that this brilliant ecological move was made primarily for security purposes, but I will not acquiesce. We have sent a man to the moon, we have mapped the human genome, and still we wrap every little thing in plastic.  Unfortunately, we've come  to  expect plastic. We demand plastic. Cellophane is our cultural code for clean, sanitary, untouched, safe, pretty, perfect. Neoprene, Orlon, Bakelite, Phenolite, Plexiglass, Polystyrene, Lustron - it's the stuff the American Dream is made of.  Europeans take it to another extreme. Walk into any bakery from Madrid to Munich to Moscow and ask for a loaf of bread and you'll be handed an unwrapped loaf by a likely-ungloved worker. Many even stick it under their arm with the evening newspaper and go along their merry way. If the bus is a little crowded or it gets warm outside, well . . . that's why God gave us an immune system.  But there is a middle ground. What's wrong with wrapping meats and fish in paper? Why not put fruits and veggies - which you have to wash anyway to remove the pesticides - in paper bags? Is it necessary to bundle our plastic bottles of soda-pop by wrapping them in even more plastic?  The continued use of plastic despite reliable scientific data asserting its insidiousness proves only one thing: our version of capitalism is often as unkind to the planet as it is to some of its inhabitants.  Scientists and politicians debate the size and viability of our existing oil reserves, even going so far as to consider drilling in a protected wildlife area. (Boo, hiss, Senator Murkowski.) If ever there was a time to rethink our energy policy, it is now, before our plastics start to envelope us.

      I am not a parent myself and will not feign expertise on childrearing, but I have one caveat to new or aspiring moms and dads: if you didn't take your academic studies seriously, maybe you shouldn't have a kid until you rethink your attitude about education.  I'm not advocating a Brave New World in which only the intelligentsia produce children but I think many new parents fail to realize that when you give birth to a child you are signing on to another 18 years of schoolwork. If you didn't want to deal with school the first time around and don't want to deal with it again, maybe you should get a puppy instead.  Part of quality parenting is education and although that takes place in many arenas and in many ways, the burden of educating your children is largely shared with the school. By the time your kid hits 18 and their formal education is over, the vast majority of your time as both legal guardian and role model is over, too.  In October 2003, Wayland-Cohocton Middle School principal Eileen Feinman began a new after-school "work lab" as a sort of mandatory, directed study hall in which students are required to spend time because their homework simply was not getting done. Since when do teachers have to play Homework Police? Forgive my brazenness, but isn't this the parents' job?  Educational research has shown again and again that the greatest indicator in a student's academic success is parent involvement. Small class sizes, a safe school environment, high pupil expectations, extra-curricular programs, family income, and strong administrative leadership, among a myriad of other things, all help, but there is absolutely no substitute for salient and positive parent involvement.  The qualification of positive parent involvement is key. Too often parents misconstrue what is means to be supportive and involved in their child's education. The vast majority of a child's learning comes through modeling and when they see their parents whine to get their way, they  learn that this is an effective way to advocate for themselves. When parents intervene every time a child is disappointed at not being cast as the lead in the school play or first chair in the band or first string on the basketball team, it does not teach kids to try harder next time or to lose gracefully. When their parents tell them to ignore or subvert a teacher's punishment, they learn to buck authority.  Sometimes personalities clash with students and teachers. C'est la vie. School isn't just about imparting factual knowledge, it's about learning healthy social interactions. It's about learning to cooperate, give and take, share, tolerate, establish boundaries, make the best of a difficult situation, and embrace diversity.  But it's also about homework, so do your children a favor and buy them a thesaurus instead of that new Game Cube.

      If Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, had the same foresight and long-range planning skills as New York State Board of Regents Commissioner Richard Mills we would be barefoot and homeless, digging potatoes out of the ground with sticks in order to subsist.  It is very noble to want kids to succeed. It is equally admirable to address the discrepancies in students' success (or lack thereof). Taking educated risks is allowable . . . in fact, it's the stuff that capitalism (and the American Way) is made of. What is not acceptable is to make policy decisions without planning carefully for the future.  It is admirable, even desirable, to raise the bar and demand excellence from our state's children. That needs to happen in measured, carefully considered steps, though. Real change happens slowly and real change is not top-down but bottom-up.  Local districts are being forced to grapple with issues that they simply should not have to. They are beholden to the State Education Department for funding and risk being labeled "In Need of Improvement" and cut off financially for non-compliance (intentional or otherwise), yet have their hands tied in many ways.  The Dansville Board of Education, for instance, has been wrestling with the decision to enact 55 or 65 as the Regents exam passing grade for earning a local diploma. If they choose 65, they risk not meeting state requirements for percentages of children passing the test, which may in turn entail intervention by the State. If they choose 55, however, they fear being seen as "lowering the bar" and embracing mediocrity.  Particularly for students with disabilities, who are being held accountable to the same standards as their general education peers, passing those standardized state exams can be a challenge tantamount to one of Hercules's twelve labors. Does this mean that students with disabilities should not take the tests at all, or even the courses? Of course not. But should schools be held accountable for the funding based on the performance of students with disabilities? Of course not.  It seems as though we are reverting to the former Regents set-up, the one that was thrown out six years ago and deemed "substandard" because it did prepare students for the work force. Part of the new-and-improved learning standards and the accompanying assessments was a complete departure from the local diploma option, retained only as a "safety net" for a handful of students with disabilities. Many schools are now moving back to a local diploma option for all students because of the unreliability of the state's exams, and many are writing their own exams altogether. It appears that the state's new standards are slowly being whittled away.  If State Ed. keeps this up, we'll be back to the Regents system of old in no time.  If the State Department of Education and the Board of Regents had developed a truly effective long-term planning strategy in advance of this most recent series of reforms, they could have avoided putting many local districts in that classic situation of "darned if you do, darned if you don't."  One of the tenets of the oft-maligned Green Party is what is known as the "seven generations" clause. This operating belief among Greens calls for a fully-researched analysis of the effects of any decision on the preceeding seven generations. I'm crossing my fingers and hoping that Spring will come early to New York this year and there will be Green popping up all over Albany.

      In the Jan. 5 issue of  The Nation  magazine, Paul Krugman, a Princeton economics professor and columnist for the New York Times, cites what he sees as an alarming and dangerous trend: the American Dream is becoming the American Illusion.  He argues that "the myth of income mobility has always exceeded the reality" but that "in modern America, it seems, you're quite likely to stay in the social and economic class into which you were born." Yikes.  He also points out that "the distribution of income in the United States has gone right back to Gilded Age levels of inequality." Statistics show that the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer. The good 'ole U. S. of A. is looking more and more like an oligarchy every day.  I do not argue for a classless society. Stratification is natural and it is a good thing as long as it is based on ability and elbow grease and not family inheritance or race or gender or religion. What made (or makes, depending on your opinion) America great is that those strata were constantly in flux. People were continuously being shuffled and re-shuffled up and down the socioeconomic ladder.  The reason that capitalism works is that it offers incentive, either to work harder, learn more, investigate new technologies, cut prices, etc. If those strata are locked in place then we might as well be a Communist society. People will stop scrambling for more or better, craftmanship and quality will decline, and our government will have to subsidize everyone and everything (which might explain the ever-increasing welfare rosters.)  Particularly among the "perestroika babies" of my generation, you would be hard-pressed to find anyone who advocates the kind of socialism that Marx - and maybe even some of the leftists of former generations - did. We all saw the Communist Experiment fail. But like any human construct, capitalism is flawed in many ways and if we're not careful the Capitalist Experiment may one day fail, too. We're due for a "kindler, gentler" capitalism - or at least let's not delude ourselves into thinking we live in a casteless society.

      Representative Sam Farr, a California Democrat, voted against the $86.9 billion spending package for Iraq and Afghanistan, $21.4 billion of which is slated for reconstruction aid to Iraq.  Representative James Walsh, a New York Republican and member of the House Appropriations Committee, likewise voted against the spending package.  Representative Tom Petri, a Wisconsin Republican, was one of only six House GOPs to vote against the $86.9 billion aid package.  What else do these politicians have in common? They are all Returned Peace Corps Volunteers.  Farr served in Colombia between 1964 and 1966, Walsh in Nepal between 1970 and 1972, and Petri in Somalia in 1966 and 1967.  Peace Corps Volunteers epitomize the ultra-altruistic, the mega-idealistic, the radical "do-gooders" of American society. Peace Corps Volunteers boldly go where no one else has gone before. Peace Corps Volunteers believe they can make the world a better place and are willing to live in squalor with no worldly compensation to realize that goal. Peace Corps Volunteers dig latrines and inoculate babies and teach English to exotic-looking children. Why would three Returned Peace Corps Volunteers vote against a bill that would give aid to two of our planet's most destitute nations?  It is precisely because Representatives Farr, Walsh, and Petri have lived and worked in the Third World that they doubt the efficacy and appropriateness of this bill. In an October 22 article by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Petri, a moderate GOP, said, "I asked to be briefed by OMB (Office of Management and Budget) on how this was going to be structured. They said, 'We don't want to get into that. Please just support the program.' I think I'm supposed to ask a few questions in this world." Both Farr and Walsh have echoed those sentiments.  Anyone who has worked in the international aid field knows that money is not always wisely spent and decisions are not always made by those most qualified to do so. Policy is often dictated by those not in the field (i.e. in Washington). Money is often thrown at problems that could be solved with a little research and analysis. Problems could be prevented by a little foresight.  My own experiences in the Peace Corps mirror those concerns. For example, the appointed Country Director of Peace Corps Romania had not only never lived or worked in Romania, but had never been a Peace Corps Volunteer. She was, however, supposed to adequately address our concerns with the staff at headquarters in Washington. She did not know the Romanian language or culture. She was, however, supposed to assist the Volunteers in smoothing out the cross-cultural mishaps that prevented us from performing our jobs effectively.  Our Country Director made $90,000 a year while we made $2,256 (the equivalent of $188 per month). We lived in modest block apartment buildings, shopped in Romanian grocery stores, and rode public transportation. Our Country Director lived in a lavish luxury apartment in the capital city, shopped at the commissary, and was chauffeured around Bucharest in a brand-new Toyota Land Cruiser. The American Embassy and Peace Corps staff are the only ones driving around Romania in SUVs. It's hard to convince "host country nationals" (the State Department lingo for "locals") that we're there to help when the management live like royalty.  The American government has the habit of throwing money at its problems. While this is more or less excusable in some fields, it is extremely problematic in international development and particularly in this day and age. We simply cannot afford to make mistakes: our national security is already fragile and any botched diplomacy or ill-conceived plans on any of the other six continents could blow up in our faces, literally and figuratively. Petri and his colleagues voted for a set of amendments to the spending bill that would give decision-makers and votes more input and transparency about the proceedings in Iraq. He wanted to see plans, organizational guidelines, and structural outlines. Is that so much to ask for?

      The American people have an embarrassingly poor grasp of world geography.  With the exception of the select few who earn their 15 minutes of fame on  Jeopardy! , most average Americans don't know Bulgaria from Burkina Faso, or Cambodia from Cameroon.  We can blame the public school system, as we do in most cases of collective national ignorance, but it's not about what is or is not on the curriculum. The lack of emphasis on international geopolitics doesn't help, but pressuring educators to add still more to their lesson plans is not the panacea.  We don't know because we don't care. When the phrase "American empire" is being bantied around in political circles, why should we?  In an article in the July/August issue of  Foreign Affairs  magazine, Harvard professor Joseph Nye, Jr. wrote, "not since Rome has one nation loomed so  large above the others . . . a little more than a decade ago, the conventional wisdom held that the United States was in decline . . .  now Americans are told that their unipolar moment will last and that they can do as they will because others have no choice but to follow."  We have an enviable position in international power politics, but it gets lonely at the top. You would be hard pressed to get them to admit it, but I think that sometimes Rumsfeld and Powell long for a little companionship on that long journey that is the War on Terrorism.  Powell, Rumsfeld, Rice, Cheney, and Bush may shape public opinion, but they are just as susceptible to prevailing trends as the rest of us. How can we hold our elected officials accountable for foreign policy decisions when we don't know anything about the issues, other than what they tell us? Should we trust them implicitly? I thought Watergate and the Monica debacle cured us of that naivete.  With another presidential election fast on our heels, I encourage the American public to break out that old atlas. How can we intelligently choose leaders when we cannot analyze their positions? We need to do more than just comprehend their stances, we need to critique them and match them with our own ideologies. Our vote needs to mean more than just who comes across well on television.  If September 11 taught us nothing else, it should be that - in the words of President Bush - "weak states, like Afghanistan, can pose as great a danger to our national interest as strong states." If ever there was a time to learn all about Malaysia and Oman, it's now.   Originally appeared in the  Genesee Country Express  on November 27, 2003

       A la  my journalist heroes Molly Ivins and Bill Moyers, I usually pontificate on the machinations of state and local government in my editorials. After all, our nation is at war (literally and figuratively), our federal deficit is spiraling out of control, our social welfare systems are creaky at best and our lawmakers' priorities are sadly misaligned.  And while even I, a self-described idealist, sometimes doubt that even a popular uprising of epic proportions can solve some of these problems, I do believe that there is one small thing that we can all do to make this world a better place -- plant less squash.  This is the time of year when it becomes dangerous to leave the house. Our friends and neighbors eye our front door and when the Lutz's have left and the coast is clear, the Squash SWAT team descends on our front porch and leaves boxes of the bulbous yellow and green vegetables.  For obvious reasons, I never lock my car doors in the church parking lot -- except in July and August, when the squash is ready to harvest. While many of us innocently socialize after church, other parishioners sneak around and drop illicit zucchini. If I'm not careful, I'll end up with 25 pounds of acorn, butternut, or Hubbard squashes in the backseat of my car.  And the same goes for the supermarket and the drug store and the bank and the post office. You are safe nowhere. If you do not have a car alarm, consider installing one or else you will be eating a loaf of zucchini bread a day until next March.  Yet even the members of my  family, who rue squash and its endless proliferation, continue to plant it. And we're not the only ones. We are glutted with squash, yet everyone in the tri-county area plants it every spring. It's a phenomenon that continues to amaze me.  Given this seemingly endless supply and almost nonexistent demand, the best thing we can do to manage our squash and zucchini crisis is to tap into these vegetables as a renewable energy source. We won't have to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, our shady dealings with OPEC nations will be out the window, and perhaps we can even mend that ever-expanding hole in the ozone.  To demonstrate my magnanimity and commitment to the cause, I'll be the first person to sign up for an Audi A4 (five-speed, preferably black) powered by spaghetti squash. We just sent little robotic ATVs to Mars, so I don't think it's too much to ask.   Originally appeared in the Genesee Country Express on July 22, 2004
