       It was an unusual afternoon that day on the 9th of March on the 4th year of the millennium. The sun in its constant vigil up above pours forth its glaring radiation through the skies. The air was heavy with moisture vaporized by the shearing heat, and there was a muted crackle of static electricity on the breeze. But all of these were just trivial background of what was about to happen on that day.   As I walk along the corridors of the Finster building I began to wonder, would this be my last lecture in my entire life? Would this be the last time that I will be on the pedestal looking down on my beloved students? Is this the grand finale of my teaching career? Anyways, I told my class to prepare for a major surprise that afternoon and that was enough to worry about at this time. I gathered all my thoughts and dismissed these uncertainties.   Meanwhile, everybody in the classroom was wide-eyed about what the surprise will be. Some took nervous glances on their notes trying to cram up last minute information to prepare for a surprise quiz. Some actually borrowed Chemistry books in the library and spend the whole lunchtime reviewing some lessons.   “Would it really be a quiz, perhaps it might be a long test,” a concern rapport from the ever-animated Karen Kate. Then, with a startled realization everybody scanned deeper to the first few pages of their notebooks.   As I entered room F706 I was greeted by a howl of frustration. Then a defiant quiver from Lesley Ann stood out from the pandemonium, “Sir, can you postpone today’s surprise long test on Thursday!”    I slyly smiled and answered, “Who says it would be an exam! The surprise of the day is in my right hand!” Then I firmly set a brown package on the table. The more they became agitated. And finally the obvious question, “Sir, what’s inside the package?” asked Nisha.   “Okay, the surprise has a relevant connection to this morning’s lecture”. We were discussing the Second Law of Thermodynamics that morning. “The surprise has  positive entropy  and  positive enthalpy . Who can guess it correctly?”   “Then Sir, those are your old test papers, and I guess were going to have an exam this day after all,” an apprehensive reply from Hazel Jay. And the uproar started again.   I calmly answered, “Of course not, making an exam involves  negative entropy , as random ideas in your mind are arranged into a more ordered form as test questions. And furthermore, making an exam takes a  negative enthalpy . Making an exam and checking the test papers requires tremendous amount of energy from an instructor, the process is  exothermic ”.  Everybody was relieved by the explanation. Then I repeat the question for the last time, “What is inside the package?”   A few seconds of suspense hangs in the air. Then as expected a very excited Paolo raises his hand and answered, “If the  enthalpy  is  positive  then it means that it is absorbing energy from the surroundings and the process in  endothermic . And if the  entropy  is  positive  then it means that it is transforming into a more random form of matter. Now, I can actually see a little bit of moisture on the sides of the package, telling me that your surprise is melting! There can be no doubt about it. Sir, your surprise is –  ICE CREAM! ”      The class erupted into cheers and applause. They were elated by Paolo’s quick-witted answer and the promise of a tasty treat. But, I think most of them were simply happy that there would be no quiz that day!   This article is the recounted and dramatized events on the last lecture day of my Chemistry 2 class with Section N1/NO. I proudly dedicate this to the Section N1/NO – Human Biology and Biology Class of 2003-04. May they continue to be enthusiastic and show avid interest in their next Chemistry classes.

        August 4 – 6, 2004 3-day Faculty Retreat in the Retreat House of the P.M. sisters, Catalunan Grande, Davao City   Facilitator: Fr. Rudy Fernandez S.J. (the original, not the action star! hehehe)       A Slice of my Thoughts (Reflections of a beleaguered young man)  At the concluding part of the retreat, I personally asked Fr. Rudy about the way Jesus preaches the Word of God. As you have noticed, the trouble of studying the preaching of Jesus is that he likes to speak in riddles and in parables. After reading the passage over and over again, you’ll seldom understand what the verses was all about. Most of the time, even more questions would arise. This is no different with reading a Physical Chemistry book!  I was referring to the passages in John, Chapter 3, the conversation of Jesus and his friend the Pharisee Nicodemus. In this story, Jesus told Nicodemus that;  “No one can see the Kingdom of God without being born again.”  John 3:3  Nicodemus was puzzled and asked Jesus; “How can a person once grown old be born again? Surely he cannot enter his mother’s womb and be born again, can he?”  Then Jesus answered;  “No one can enter the Kingdom of God without being born of water and spirit. What is born of flesh is flesh and what is born of spirit is spirit”.  John 3:6  Jesus also added the phrases;  “The wind blows where it wills, and you can hear the sound it makes, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes, so it is with everyone who is born of the spirit.”  John 3:8  So exactly how can someone be born again? What does Jesus mean by “born of the spirit”? How can someone be “born of the spirit”? If you read the story over and over again, you will encounter many questions like these.  Fr Rudy answered by queries by starting with; “Jesus speaks in parables because Jesus was a great teacher! And probably the best teacher in the history of mankind!”  Bam! It hit me hard on the chest. Is this how you become a good teacher. Leaving your students in a momentary blindness. Letting them groping in the dark and staggering through the unknown expanse. Searching for enlightenment, with no other senses to guide them except their own.  If I apply the same strategy in my Chemistry classes, I don’t think I will last until the Midterms. Parents will come flocking to the President’s office, with a weaver of my termination on their hands. “Terminate him! Terminate him!” as I imagine them angrily voicing out their disgust. Then, I would suffer the same fate with those of Dr. Afalla and Ms. Delos Santos, dear colleagues in the Chemistry Department.  Not that I am whining about Jesus’ way of teaching. It’s just that, following this line of argument, then I can say I have not been a good teacher after all! In fact, I might as well give myself A+ for effort but D- for teaching competence. Not even a passing grade for me! (Bagsak dapat teacher ninyo! hehehe)  One by one, doubts began to sprout in my mind, clouding up my vision. Have I really prepared my students to face their uncertain future? Have I provided them enough teachings to combat against a cruel world? Did I provide them with potent values to shield them away from the evil lurking all around us?  All I can come up with is this; “Well anyway, I was not trained to be a teacher. I was brought up to be a Chemist. It was a nice try but I might as well give up my teaching profession and go to what I really worked hard for. To work as Analytical Chemist in the industries or in the field of research. I’ll let go five years of my life and move on!” A little later, Fr Rudy also explained to me that; “Initially you are at a dark. Then you start to reminisce your previous experiences. In this serene moment, God is conversing with you. As you focus on with your life, a creeping sense of enlightenment pervades your spirit. Soon enough you will realize that the mystical messages have been encrypted. The hidden treasures – the word of God – unlocked. And finally, Eureka! The trumpets of heaven rejoice over your triumph”.  This I think is the essence of real learning. Gathering the accurate results, discerning the correct answers, and formulating the precise explanation on your own. This way every neuron in the brain is fired into action – sharpening your wits. This is the ultimate exercise of the mental and intellectual facilities. When the mind is strong, the spirit will be invincible! And when the spirit is resistant, then the body will do amazing acts of goodness!   My dear students and friends, learn to listen to your soul. Try to live a life in constant dialogue with the spirit. Ask yourself whether you did the right thing or not in everything that you do. In these moments of silence, the omnipotent God will take shape in front of you!  Try to a life with a clear conscience. Ask yourself if this is what God intends me to do or not in your everyday decision. In these moments of peace, the venerable Holy Spirit will baptize you! Be born again!

          HAMMER TIME!       In a dusty corner of Davao City, in a time not far from forgotten. There exist a group of enraged juveniles banded together by their exuberant youthfulness and trivial obsessions. Although, the gang did not call themselves any particular moniker, they were notorious in their relentless plundering and whimsical sporting. They were the unnamed and faceless pranksters, snipping and slashing their way out of bizarre crime scenes. Wriggling and unlatching themselves from the iron grasp of a dubious authority. With the perfect mixture of bravado and stupendous luck, they do attain astounding feats. And most of all, like the “ Cowboys from Hell ” they were driven by demons they cannot exorcise.   The Gang  [Insert pic of Budoy] The leader of the gang is the debonair Andrew James, a.k.a “  Budoy  ”. His flamboyant burst of eloquence is a perfect disguise, luring their hapless victim Mrs. Betty Meralpis, the school librarian into a false sense of security. “  Ma’am, pwede po bang mag-browse sa mga lumang newspapers at magazines ninyo? Magreresearch lang po kami para sa Araling Panlipunan.  ” A few minutes after Ma’am Betty left the libary the gang springs into action. Budoy eyes the glistening posters and cover stories of his basketball idols with extreme gusto. With Michael Jordan’s “tongue-sticking-out-of-his-mouth” slam dunks to Charles Barkley’s “elbows-flying-out-of-nowhere” rebounds. Nothing escapes from Budoy’s talon-like scissors.  [Insert pic of Lolo] Considered to be the brain of the group is the eccentric Roland Anthony a.k.a “  Lolo  ”. His diabolical schemes and strategic planning is the corner stone of their covert operations. And with his cunning plot of the crime scene, the gang moves with a deadly efficiency, like a perpetual motion machine. His primary arsenal is a small razor blade, which can easily be hidden under the seams of his faded blue Jag jeans. Lolo cuts out the Trivia sections of the Philippine Daily Inquirer, filing up for his stacks of trivia collection at home. In one of his misadventures he was nearly caught. “  Mr. Mindo ano yan?  ” Ma'am Betty inquired. “  Ma’am, wala po Ma’am  ,” and with a slight of hand the razor blade swiftly retracts to the folds of his palm. It was a fortunate escape act.  (Highly ingenious Lolo!)   [Insert pic of Pehing] Rhodnezzar a.k.a " Pehing " is our call-out guy. His aerodynamically designed head and his quirky ears makes him an indispensable member of the gang. Pehing cannot resist incising the pictures and articles of his favorite team, the Shell Formula-X circa 1991. Without warning, Pehing whistled a soft note to signal that someone was coming. And in a matter of split second scissors, cutters, incisors, and razor blades were tucked into their hiding places and our charade resumed. Ma’am Betty came back to retrieve her eyeglasses on her desk. She spied us and said, “  O, sige i-arrange ninyo ang mga newspapers at books pagkatapos ng research ninyo ha.  ” And with a meek reply “  Yes, Ma’am  ,” the librarian was still ignorant of the atrocity happening. Even if the library was disheveled and all, the librarian appeared to be unmindful to the students heavily absorbed in their research.  [Insert pic of Momo] The muscle man and the utility guy of the group is the robust Enrico a.k.a " Momo ". His strength and uncanny ability to lift piles of stacked up periodicals is invaluable. Without Momo, we possibly cannot reach down into the old issues of articles, which we considered to be priceless. Momo is a chess enthusiast. He tears out pages of chess articles and abbreviated chess games for his collections. He severs them out with the brute force of his adept fingers, needing no help from any cutting devices.  (Very resourceful ha!)   [Insert pic of Raym, hehehe yourself pala] And lastly, the self-proclaimed team mascot is the amiable Ramesh a.k.a " Raym ". Not a regular member of the gang, but on this ill-fated day he joined us in the library to skim through the encyclopedia. He actually jinxed us in all of our modus operandi especially when he was with us.  (Not bad for a team mascot eh!)    The End of Days  So the unfateful day that the gang was busted came. We were in the thick of business and our ripped-up pages were already thickening under Budoy’s notebook. When from out of nowhere, three fourth year students came flocking outside our left-side window. They were busy spying out something that they barely noticed us shredding down our condemned victims. “  Hoy!, anong ginagawa ninyo dyan?  ” a hoarse whisper from Pehing caught our attention. We immediately disposed our paraphernalia and act as if reading the compositions. They did not answer the question, but instead keep on pointing at something beyond our line of sight. We climbed up to our chairs and followed the direction of their gazes. What we saw shocked us out of our senses! There slouching low on the sofa and with her eyes closed was the seductive and voluptuous Ma’am Daisy Trinidad. Her legs were spread apart. Her mini skirt opened up to the heavens. Her silky white panties were showing, enticing us like a vixen out in a pallid twilight. (Oh, my God!) We looked at each other and shrugged. Then finally Budoy commanded the gang, “  Tapos na yata ang  Hammer time  natin ngayon mga boys. Lets cover up our tracks.  ” “  Ok, you’re the boss  ,” a reluctant answer from Momo. We started gathering up all the magazines and newspapers and returned it on the stockpile. Meanwhile, the boys outside were doing something totally unexpected. They called out their classmates from their classroom next door. And from a company of three, there came a crowd of twelve. Their lustful eyes unblinking, and their watery mouths were gaping at the erotic sight. They became unruly and keep on jostling for the best view. Then they started howling and bashing themselves at the unbelievable luck at their hands. With all that noise and commotion, Ma’am Daisy stirred and opened her eyes. The boys hurriedly ducked down under the window. And in no time, they all rushed back to their classrooms. That left us caught on the spot, what an unbelievable luck!  (Later on, we realized that Raym was with us. Good gracious Raym!)  With no escape route possible, we jittery pretended to read the magazines spread around the floor. “  O, anong ginagawa ninyo dyan boys?  ” and without waiting for an answer added, “   Rhodne, klaro ba ang panty ko dyan?!!   ” Pehing was dumbstruck as if thunder slapped all the breath in him. We lowered down our heads until it strained our necks. And with that remark, she stomped out of the library in disgust. Almost at the same moment, Ma’am Betty returned carrying new issues of magazines and newspapers.  (So this is how it is like to be the unluckiest person in the world, thanks to Raym.)  “  Uyyy, bakit punit-punit na ang mga old newspapers natin?  ” asked Ma’am Betty while probing through the heap of shredded newspapers and magazines. “  Ewan ko po Ma’am. Siguro may naga-cut out ng mga articles dito. Halos nga wala kaming makuhang magagandang stories kasi po napuputol,  ” answered Budoy in his usual ice-cold tremolo voice. “  Ahhh, ganoon ba? Siguro itago ko na lang itong mga old magazines sa stockroom para wala ng mag cut-out. Okay boys, tulungan nyo akong buhatin ang mga ito sa stockroom ha.  ” We obeyed her with out further remorse. That was the last time we saw the newspapers and magazines. Whhhaa… our pirated treasures are finally gone!  (Your happy days are over folks! Buti na lang hindi kayo napatawag sa principal or something like that. Thus, we are still thankful for our mascot for such a happy ending!)      P.S. Hammer time was one of the most successful gimmicks the gang has had in their lustrous career as despicable criminals. We regret losing our precious treasures this way.
