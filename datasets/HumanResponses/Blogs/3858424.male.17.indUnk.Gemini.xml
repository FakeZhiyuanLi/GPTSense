      	Today I was thinking about a lot of the hypocritical bullshit that takes place in this world on a daily basis. I came to this conclusion after much thought. What I realized is that everyone in this world is in it for competition. They are just doing shit so they can compete to get some shit that will never fully satisfy them. Jocks compete in football to go to the championship and get a damn trophy, but they aren't satisfied even if they make it all the way to their godforsaken championship. Because they will always look back and say, ‘Oh no, I only had a record of 10-6.’ Well buddy you made it all the way to the fucking championship, but that obviously isn't good enough for yourself. I guess its just human nature. It doesn't matter how good you have it you always want better. Even the richest man in the world, Bill Gates, isn't satisfied. If he was, don't you think his $46 billion dollar ass would fucking retire and buy a small Caribbean Island? Well apparently not. He keeps making his shitty windows operating system and flooding the market with sub par 1st party X-Box games so that his $46 billion dollars turns into $47 billion. He has more money than most countries and he is still not happy. Even the big movie stars can’t be happy. Like Ben Affleck, he was engaged to the gorgeous Jennifer Lopez and he decided she is not hot enough and cheats on her. What the fuck is up with that? Not to mention he has enough money to live for the rest of his life at 31 without having to make another shitty movie ever. Hopefully he will retire and we won’t have to ever see another Reindeer Games or Bounce. The only redeeming part of Reindeer Games was Charlize Theron’s rack. All life is, is one big fucking competition to see who can get the more money, the faster car, the hotter girl, the bigger house, well I say fuck everyone and their competitions. I am sick of seeing guys with girls I can only dream about pissing it all away because they can make out with some random girl or fuck some other girl or finally fulfill their fantasy of a threesome. Anything anyone will ever accomplish will not be good enough for themself. I am sick of all these people bitching and moaning with I wish this and I wish that. Well its bullshit. You may think the grass is greener on the other side, but I don’t care what you think. You probably have some hot girl that isn’t good enough for you. Or your set for life as far as money goes and it doesn’t matter what you do. I really think you should take your green grass and shove it up your ass because I am sick of everyone’s bullshit.
