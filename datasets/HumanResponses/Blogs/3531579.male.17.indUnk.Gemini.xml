                              Every Time  Every time I hear your name I smile inside. Every time I see your face I start to glow inside. Every time you say my name, my heart beats faster. And every time I am not near you my inside utopia starts to fade.  Weather you know or not you are in my heart. You have made a lasting impression, Its like a perminant finger print where no one else could ever reach in my heart. One day you will know how much you mean to me, and I hope I will mean as much to you.

      I Want To Live   -Josh Gracin  Sometimes I feel like I need to shake myself To wake myself I feel like I'm just sleep walkin through my life Its like I'm swimmin' in the ocean of emotion But still somehow slowly goin' numb inside  I don't like who I'm becomin' I know I've got to do somethin' Before my life passes right by  I wanna cry like the rain Cry like the rain Shine like the sun on a beautiful mornin' Sing to the heavens like a church bell ringin' Fight with the devil and go down swingin' Fly like a bird Roll like a stone Love like I aint afraid to be alone Take everything that this world has to give I wanna live  Sometimes I wonder why I work so hard To guard my heart Well I hardly feel anything at all I've spent my whole life building up this ivory tower Now that I'm in it I keep wishin' it would fall  So I could feel the ground beneath me Well it takes this air I'm breathin To know that I'm alive  I wanna cry like the rain Cry like the rain Shine like the sun on a beautiful mornin' Sing to the heavens like a church bell ringin' Fight with the devil and go down swingin' Fly like a bird Roll like a stone Love like I aint afraid to be alone Take everything that this world has to give I wanna live I wanna live  Something deep inside keeps saying life is like a vaper Its gone in just a twinklin' of an eye  I wanna cry like the rain Cry like the rain Shine like the sun on a beautiful mornin' Sing tothe heavens like a church bell ringin' Fight with the devil and go down swingin' Fly like a bird Roll like a stone Love like I aint afraid to be alone Take everything that this world has to give I wanna take any breath I can get I wanna live  Yeah Yeah   I finally found a song that describes my feelings about my life!!!
