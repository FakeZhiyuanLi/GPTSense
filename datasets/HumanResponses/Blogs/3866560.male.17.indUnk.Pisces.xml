      Omg, i hate church camps with every fiber of my soul. I hate them with a passion so hot, that satan himself would say, "Damn kid, calm the fuck down." We got there, and unloaded all of our stuff, and it turns out that our church youth leader guy set all of our church high school boys up to be in the same cabin with him (total of 6 guys including brian (youth leader guy)). This was awesome, because we are 4 very roudy kids, and one little sickly one (neal) lol. he wasnt really sickly but he was the butt of like every joke, him or his sister, who he informed us out of nowhere that she will be "legal in 9 months", no joke. Brian is one of those counselors that is like, go do whatever, just dont wake me up or keep me awake, and if you get caught, i didnt say you could. Haha, he's awesome. The first night, we stole neals matress like twice (we already had all of our beds double stacked with matresses) and just kept messing with him, and finally out of nowhere, he leaves the cabin, and walks out towards the woods. we were laughing and wondering what the hell is he doing, when he came back in, he was all scratched up and soaked, just kidding. He was picked up by a counselor in a golf cart and brought back. Ohh yeah, i failed to mention, that along with us in our cabin, was this one kid who i think was a little slow and had a speech impediment. He was insane, he claimed to have a magic 3 foot high chihuahua that can turn invisible chase him all day. Well, we felt sorry for him, so we didnt mess with him too much, but instead turned on eachother and went right for the nipples. During the days was very gay, and everything was all planned out faggotry, like down to the minute gayness. i'm talking 3-5 bible studies a day, loooooong ass worships, and things like a "prayer trail". I skipped a lot of them, so we arent going to talk about the days because nothing fun happened during the days. The next night we stacked like 5or 6 little one foot high wodden beds, and put a matress on top of it, then we put like 4 matresses on another bed near it and dove onto it, and did tricks and such, it was much fun. All thru-out the camp nights, we all had gained multiple bruises around the nipple area. Ohh yeah, utter twist or be twisted scenario 24/7. Well, about the 3 day, we were messing around with matresses (the only thing funny happen during the day), and they put one of mine under the crazy/half retarded kid ( haha, i feel so horrible for calling him retarded but it had to be said) in hopes of getting me mad at the kid for stealing my matress. Idioths. Well i took the top one, thinking it was mine, and put it on my bed. I was about to lay down when i looked at it from afar, and realized that there was a huge piss stain, right in the middle of the matress. WHAT THE HELL! They told me that it was his, and that my old matress was underneath him, and i was relieved. ^_^. We switched it out with nathan's (one of the guys from our church) and he came back to find that his sleeping bag was wet. Thats right, the piss stain was fresh, and soaked all the way through the back of the matress as well. 0.0 We laughed so hard we almost pissed ourselves, haha, no pun intended, your a wonderful audience, hello? hahaha i'm such a retard. Anyways... dan was in the bathroom later when the kid walked in (Thomas, or like i and the rest of our cabin call him, Tom Tom), not knowing dan was there, he looked his soggy matress leaning against the wall, and said "shit", in his little funny accent. Hahaha, we laughted at that again for a long time. Then that night, a storm hit that rocked the walls of our cabins, it was awesome, the whole sky lit up and i was drawn outside, along with the rest of the boy's camp. (Tornado warning was in effect, so we were all excited and stuff. The boys side of the Sr. High camp, was split into 2 cabin buildings, each consisting of 3 cabins, and inbetween those cabins that night, was a nice river of wetness and mud. It was the coolest thing, Everyone was outside running around, trying to keep out of sight of the counselors in the main building, we snuck up behind the building and to the other side (it took many attempts to do this alone), and we kept knocking on the girls cabin doors and running away. During this, one of my friends tripped over a metal pipe and fell straight into the mud, it was hilarious, until he came to our cabin and got mud and shit everywhere. That was the best time, that night at like 5 in the morning, a bunch of black guys snuck into our cabins and stold all of our pillows at once, and ran out, we were so tired, we did without. The next morning!!, WE FINALLY GET TO LEAVE, but not without one last massive dose of gayness to keep you set for about 2 more weeks. Another worship time, longer and more obnoxious that all of the rest put together, thats right. But i was able to find humor in all of the things that went on , for example, while we were taking communion ( eating: Bread- jesus's Body, and crappy grape juice- jesus's blood, mmmmm, mmm, jesus has never tasted better) they were singing a song called "We Are Hungry", in which they say the words, we are hungry, we are hungry, we are hungry for more of you, we are thirsty, we are thirsty, we are thirsty for more of you. Hahaha, those greedy bastards, they didnt get enough of jesus the first time, "Umm, excuse me, can we get seconds of jesus." It's not even supposed to be because you are hungry for bread and shitty grape juice aka. "wine", but rather for salvation, awwwww. Anyways, the camp sucked more male genitalia than it ever has before, so i say, never again!  '(o,o') /(vvv) Hooty- hoo

      This is a Blog dedicated to my poor dead chicken. She was ruthlessly murdered by our neighbors little bastard Dachshunds. Thats right, two little pussie ass wiener dogs killed my chicken. They attacked her and killed her and then trotted up to us wagging their tails in hopes of approval for their act. But if they had come to me and looked up at&nbsp;ME with those little puppy-dog faces, i would have broken them with my fucking shoe. But lucky for them they didnt. We couldnt even give her a proper burrial, no, what did she get as her final parting gift you ask? A dump in the trash can on the side of the house, thats what.   So in Memory of our beloved Cruela, my favorite pet chicken i ever had.

      This will be a short one i promise. Last night, we decided we were gonna go and run around all night. This never works simply because, there is never anything to do in our happy little town of college station. So it wasnt long till trouble happens. I get there, and am informed that 2 big black guys were hitting on kerri. Steventeve and dan, being the endless sea of knowledge that they are, (love you guys) led them down to the basement where all of her chinese friends were because, the black guys "wanted to get with some asian chicks." Of course they did this as a joke, but Kerri was flipping out, and i dont blame her. (Never get mixed up in the Chinese mafia/ circle, they know all see all 0.0) Well after that we were walking around outside amd steven and dan and i were gonna go back down to the basement and tell the black guys that i was&nbsp;Kerri's boyfriend (I love Jordan more than anything in the world)&nbsp;and ask them&nbsp;leave her and her friends alone. Well, they weren't down there, but on the way back out, someone came up with the brilliant idea to come running out of the MSC running and screaming, like something had happened. I was going along with it at first but when i got to the door, i thought it to be a bad idea, so i didn't follow thru, but dan and steven were already almost across the street. It turned out that that was a very bad idea, but everything is behind us now. The better part of this story is yet to come. Steven decided that he wanted to take a walk alone for his own personal reasons and leave us there in the parking lot. So we went to McDonalds without him. There i get a phone call, it's steven. He wants us to come pick him up, but aparent;y not now. So we finnish eating, and we go find him laying down on a bench. Kerri and Sebass are gone, but we picked up James who is supposed to be sleeping in his little dorm&nbsp;for a leadership class at&nbsp;A&M. We decide that there is noplace to go other than the msc. So i have to go back and park, then we all walk to the msc, and walk around there for a little bit, until we get to the basement. There me and James lay down on the cussioned sheets and fall asleep, while dan and steven are fucking about. I kinda woke up half asleep like 4 times, and in one of those times, i collected that steven had&nbsp; gone to the bathroom and masturbated into a little saucer, good job steven. Then when i was finally awoken, it was around 4 am. or so, and it was dan calling me an asshole and a fag, (he does that alot, he has a real bad anger problem that he needs to have worked out), it turns out that i was tossing and turning and messing up their fort. ..., their fort? after much coaxing, i get up, and see that they have gotten a bunch of old sheets from the dumpster and layed them over the tables and chairs and stuff. All in all it was a really cool fort. It was the Independant Sovereign Nation, the Democratic Republic of ... something. Dan was the President, steven was the majority of the senate, and i was the customs agent/ minority percentage of the senate, and the only standing soldier. Our national Animal was the Cockroach, pronounced,&nbsp;(Ka-Ka-roach). We all fell asleep in our nation except for james, who was asleep the whole time. We were rudely awoken around 5:30 by a tapping of a salt shaker on our beautiful fort, followed by a voice that would make a man's balls shrivle up and die, saying, Get out of there, and pick up your crap! It was this bitchy little rent-a-cop saying that we were illegally sleeping downstairs. Ohh yes, aparently, it's ok for people to sleep upstairs, but when they go downstairs they are way out of line!they took us upstairs and sat us down on the couches at the main counter place, and James was looking like a crack addict i swear to god. He was shivering, chattering his teeth, squinting his eyes, and rocking back and fourth, and it was like 85-90 degrees in there. They questioned us and almost called my mom, but they didnt. We were so scared. But we got lucky and were able to leave. It gives me chills, just to think about it again.  haha, whoops, i lied, this one was kinda long too. ^_^

      ^_^, well well well, i'm back. I had about as much fun at a church camp that any non-christian could have lol. (which isn't much) i was there from sunday- saturday. We'll as i stated before, at this church camp, we work, and we work damn hard in the sun. We'll the first night, we had to pick out our rooms and head in for dinner where we will meet our work groups (mine was Green N, wooooo) . Then off to worship, horrah! I think that i slept at least some of the time during every worship service (ever single night at like 10:30). I also drew some stuff during this time, which i was very proud of ^_^, i'm a good artist. We then proceded to our rooms. Here was the first enjoyment i got out of this trip. The first night, everyone was hyper and didn't want to sleep. So we were up until at least 1:00 every night. Everyone wanted to stay up, except for one person. I have this friend, Kent, (i call him Lil. Kentaminoes), and aparently, he must sleep well every night or something bad will happen (i dunno, mabey his dick will fall off or something), so we stole his air matress, deflated it, and hid it in a cabinet. He got so mad, but we all swore we didnt know what happened to it. so he flopped down and tried to get to sleep, while we stayed up playing with lego's and with air pumps, and he attempted to sleep with only his sleeping bag. (thats what i, and most other people there did, but i guess he is just to good for that) The guy even had earplugs in his ears, FUCKING EARPLUGS ^_^, but he still occasionally jumped up and screamed at us to shut up and go to sleep. So another of our church buddies, had this great manual air pump with a nozzle that shot air at like 90 miles an hour. Kent was laying down on top of his sleeping bag, in his boxorz. We put the nozzle like an inch away from his asshole, and Will goes, 1..2..3.. and jumps into the air, and comes down with all his force on the air pump. Kent shot straight up and screamed, then faced Will and attacked him. (Kent is small so he did no damage) The next morning (they make us get up at 6:50 btw) we went to work, our first job was to repair a roof and a hole in the celing from water damage. We did this and also built a handrail but it took us 2 days to do it cause we kept running out of supplies. The next day (wed.) We had a hizzle to paint (or pintar, for those of you who are mexican), we worked hard the whole time, and finnished the whole house in one day, WOOOO, GREEN N!!!, yeah... no. This night was quite fun. I brought my ninja uniform to the camp, so i could put it on some random day. It was great. I came down and everyone lookd at me like i was retarded, and then came up to me to compliment it. I was dubbed the nipple ninja because every chance i could that night, i would purple nurple Neal. It was great, he probably still has bruises around his nipples (for a ninja, i have terrible aim). Earlier i had obtained one of those old fassioned metal slinkies, and we were extreme slinky-ing (you know, slinking it off of tall ledges and buildings, it was fun) Later on that night, me and Kevin and some other people got up to the dorm room earlier than the rest, and we were feeling mischievious. We had chocolate that we put inside of Brian's bed (neal smushed it in with his ass), and we found a jar of glitter which we put inside Jeremy's bed (an extreme Goth kid who wont shower, he didnt even take off his gloves the whole trip lol. He would wash all of the visible skin with his gloves still on, which wasn't much.) Speaking of which, showering... yeah! The girls got 23 little stalls with individual showerheads, the boys get one big stall with huge open doors and 23 little showerheads along the walls, so there were a bunch of naked guys just walking around and showering. It was funny tho, cause we alwasy sang in the shower. haha, So our next and final project was the biggest of all, we had to tear up and rebuild this one part of these really cool, old black people's roof. The guy had blue eyes!!, BLUE EYES, it was awesome. While we were working, these wasps crawled out and began flying all around, Amber was just standing there, all cool like, as they were flying all around her head. Hilary was flippin out, i was afraid she was gonna fall off of the roof, and me, being the macho man i was, was just standing there, all like, i'm cool, w/e, no biggie. Until they got close to my head, then i walked to the other side, and the wasp followed me, and then i started running around the little fragile roof, being chased by this psycho wasp, then i stopped, and the damn thing hit me right in the face. Then i freaked out and it went in my hair! (oooh, i'm so manly) so at first i was calm, so i was like, ok... it's in my hair. get it out, it's in my hair. IT'S IN MY FREAKING HAIR GET IT OUT GET IT OUT GET IT OUT! hahaha, it was great. So every time i saw a wasp after that, i took it upon myself to hit them with a big stick (excalibur). Then we found the nest, and i took it out, and we were trying to get all of the little maggots out and stuff cause it was something to do. And i came across this one little baby wasp, who when i open up the little case it was in, it moved and tried to crawl out. We were awww, so we watched as it hatched out, and crawled around on the nest, and i was like, MY BABY!! i turn around to work on the house then i turn back, and my baby is shrivled up on the roof, twitching and squirming. AMBER POISONED MY BABY!!! it was tragic.   haha, i have a tendency to make long blogs, for maximum enjoyment, read all the way through.   That night after everyting at worship, i passed the time by torturing two of my friends there, who never had to piss worse in their life it looked like. First off, i was telling them how "tomorow i think we are gonna be watering lawns and stuff, but thats after we wash the cars and shower, man i really wanted to go to niagra falls this summer" and stuff like that. Then i made the water drop noise for like 5 min (you know, that noise where you thump your mouth&nbsp;and whistle at the same time, and it sounds like a drop of water falling). It was hilarious, so like in the middle of the service, they ran out holding themselves HAHAHA. So the next day we finnished up our site and stuff, it was a prety uneventful day other that us sweating in the 120 degrees heat.(not joking, it really was around 120 on the roof). Still Jeremy has not showered. The next day we pack up and leave for home. Ahh, and how nice it is to be home. Good Game my friends, good game.

      Well, tomorow is the day, i've drawn out packing for it across a span of 3 days, and now it's finally come. At whatever (between 10:50 and 12:00) i will be leaving for a week. Yes i know, tragic but true, but the good new is i will be out doing good stuff for people who cant for some reason do it themselves, too old, paralized, maimed from "nam" (Vietnam) whatever reason. So we go out and do it for them, church thing... funny tho, people wonder y i do christian activities like this even though i'm not christian. Well, i'm sorry that i like to go out and help people who cant help themselves, asshole. Well, i better be hittin the 'ol dusty trail.  Till next time.

      hello everyone, i said earlier that i wouldnt be writing everyday, but you know what, i guess i will be, because my life wont let me have a nice regular 'ol time. It all started about a couple of weeks ago, when somehow, to topic of going hiking somewhere in huntsville. Yeah ok... it sounded alright so i agreed, but it sounded like it was going to be one of those things in our group that never gets done, but guess what, they set a date to do it. Ok, so we are gonna go hiking in the woods, that will be relaxing and fun right? Well, i was told to get up and head over to steven's at about 9:00 in the morning, that in itself is a feat for me -_-. When i got there, kerri was already there, along with sebastian. Kerri made us french toast (that surprised me, because we(me and steven) always go over to her house without telling her, and ask her for chinese food, it's a tradition) and it was really good. I'm glad i ate then cause i wouldn't be eating for a while ^_^, you would think that if you take the effort to get up at 9 that you would leave around that time so it doesnt get too hot while we are out there. No, of course, that wasn't steven and kerri's kind of reasoning, they figured that since they are tired, we should just sleep for a little bit. Well, after about an hour we actually left. The trip there was interesting, we listened to swing music (Big Bad Voodoo Daddy), it was awesome, i reccomend you check it out. We came to some construction work and we had to stop for a little bit, but then this little truck lead us down the street and out of the construction, -_-, you would think that people would know how to go down a street by themselves without having to be led by the hand till the end of the constrution. Well, i was in a good mood, so i swerved inbetween the cones in the middle of the street while being led ^_^. When we finally got to our destination, we had to pay 3 dollars each to get in. We had a short fight about money and stuff ^_^, then we were off, we found the trail ok, and when we were on it, everthing was cool. To help pass the time, we teased Kerri about stuff (it's classified, better not ask, i'll break your face!) to try and get information out of her (again, dont you ask!! *beats fist on open hand). We ended up all taking our shirts off cause steven wanted kerri to take hers off so she would only be in her sports bra. lol. After about the first hour of solid walking, we were noticing that our water supply was running out, which consisted of 3 bottles. yes 3 bottles to 4 people, 5-6 hours in the woods, you do the math. (it's ok steven, we lived ^_^) This is when we began getting tired and worried. Kerri began getting quite tired and we took breaks. Steven, by the way, had a faster pace than us, so almost the whole time he was ahead of us, so we caught up to him whenever he either took a break or waited for us, i couldnt tell. So it was me and sebastian most of the time comforting Kerri, hahaha, but anyways, we were walking the whole first 2 hours with little water, and it ran out in this time. Then about the whole second hour we were walking in hopes of catching sight of this dam, because this would mean that we were a little more than halfway done. Steven was with us this part of the way lol. We finally see the lake, but no dam... then we come up the hill, and see this looong road in the sun and at the end was a clearing, so we were hoping that that would be it. And we were right, at the end of the road we finally found the bottom of the dam, we had to step across these small stone steps seperated by water and covered with slippery moss (we were very thirsty even now, so that dam water was looking gross, but still very apealing), but amazingly we all made it across without falling in to the water.   ** haha, man this is a long post, stay with me tho, it's worth it**   We rested on the other side, and while doing this i threw a small piece of bark at this dragonfly and i hit it!! I named it evinrude and it "followed us" the whole way through, just with "different painjobs."  After this, we were very very thirsty, and getting extremely tired. We were back in the woods though, so that was good, we had some shade, But by now, kerri was becomming delerious, (it was really funny, but kinda scarry s well ^_^) She was saying the dumbest stuff, like once, me, sebastian, and steven, were standing up and she was on the ground, and her phone rang, and when she answered it, she said and i quote "yeah?, sorry, you have the wrowng numumolv ... ablublublu" then she hung up. hahaha. it was great. It was like she was stoned or something. Well, on our way some joggers comming from the other direction passed us, and all of them had pierced ears, and at least... a lot of them had stretched plugs. We asked one of them how far till the exit, and he said, Well it's about 3 miles... (3 more miles, you've got to be kidding me!) and when you get to aan intersection with a dirt roadlike thing, go left, and it will take you straight out. Yeah... ok. ohh yeah, we found the road, and we went left, but that road went on for like at least an hour and a half before we saw anything. Steven was ahead of us this whole time, we could only see a small steven off in the distance. And the whole time on this barin (i dont care if thats not how you spell it!) road, Kerri would have to stop every 100 feet, it was bad, we were all dizzy almost to the point of falling over, we were all dehydrated, and heat exausted, and Kerri still wouldnt let us carry her. You would think, that for $3 fucking dollars a person, that they would at least be able to put a water faucet or a water fountain somewhere on the trail, i got desperate enough to drink from a stream on the side of the road, even though there was nasty brown/ orange algae at the bottom of this 3 inch deep rain drainage ditch. Well, by this time, we were all depressed because we didnt know when it would end, but all of a sudden, way off in the distance, i saw something white flash at what appeared to be the end of the road. Then i saw it again, IT WAS PASSING CARS!, we finally made it, There was much rejoicing (again, i dont care if i spelled it wrong), then as we got closer, we heard a very agonizing, very loud, GOD DAMNIT!. well, we kept on going, and by and by steven came up to us, walking towards us, this cant be good. When he arives, he informs us that at the end, there is a gate, A GATE THAT LEADS TO THE FUCKING HIGHWAY! about a mile from the park, then we are parked about a mile into the park. We were so pissed and upset,   ** it's almost over**  we called 911, and no, we did not ask for an ambulance, but you know what?, they sent one, ohh yeah, we were sent an ambulance, and you know what, they couldnt even give us a ride to our car, much less give us some water. But we did get to fill out some paperwork, yay! they called a park ranger to come and get us, he took about 15 min to come and we were all sick of the ambulance people making smalltalk, and then guess what, the park ranger came, and he said his car was too small! ohh terrific. He then called yet ANOTHER ranger with a truck to take us back. We finally were able to leave. HAHA, and get this. i thought it was deliciously ironic, this officer of the law, was riding without a seatbelt, and speeding. ^_^ When we got back we got to a waterfountain and had our way with it. Then we went to subway for a good hour. So next time someone asks you to go hiking, either say screw you and never talk to them again, or bring a lot of water.

       ^_^, hello everbody, my name is Noneofyourbuisness R. McCloud. I'm sure you will become very familiar with me when you get addicted to my great writing. HAHA wooo. anyways. this being my first blog, it always the tradition to write about nothing at all. (don't question it!, it's a real tradition.) So first off, an intro. i am a 17 year old with nothing better to do with his life other than to drive around with his friends (yes, i have friends, so there wont be an update everyday, i'm sorry, you'll live). We go around doing stupid stuff like blowing things up with homemade explosives or just wasting as much time as possible. haha, i should work on getting a job but you know what?, as much as my parents really want me to, i really dont want to, and i'm really not going to ^_^. I have a stunning girlfriend, everything i could ever hope for in a girl and i love her. So, lately, Jordan (girlfriend) went out of town for a couple weeks =[. But i'm thinkin when she gets back i'm gonna take her out to dinner. There has been a little ripple in my little pool of friends, mainly dealing with one frind hanging out with another friend's girlfriend more than the boyfriend does. (you know who you are ^_^) That lasted a span of about a week of confusing and utter annoyance of not being able to speak of or hang out with them at the same time (which is hard in our little circle cause thats all we ever do) it is currently dying down but the couple is no longer a couple, but at least the main part is over. If you haven't seen Fahrenheit 911 you should, Jordan and i went to see it, it takes about everything out of context and yes, some of the facts may or may not be stretched, but informative none the less. It is more of a doccumentary rather than a movie, but i still enjoyed it. (very much ^_-) Well, a couple of days ago i went over to Jordans house and we watched Aladin ^_^. But mostly we listened to Modest Mouse (great, great band, check into it) and i talked to some of her ex boyfriends and such, ho ho, it was funny, i'm an ass ^_^. While i was there, i somehow managed to rename her dogs. She has this little Rat Terrior previously dubbed the name Molly. Pfft, what kind of a person would like to have the name molly. Good god (No offense to any Molly's out there, it's not your fault, blame you parents)that poor dog, you could clearly see that this beautiful creature was deeply tormented and could hardly stand living, she was obviously suicidal and needed help, lucky thing i was there. What was the name i gave this dog?, none other than Captain Yarbles. yes, Captain Yarbles. i could tell that she really loved her new name because she didnt bite me for the rest of the night. Her other dog is a shaggy dog who was much, much harder to rename for you see, i could not tell what kind of dog this was, and i had no idea what his real name was, so i had nothing to go on (it was still a cool dog, it knew how pimp the shag look.) I had no choice but to name him -Garfunkle- after, of course, Simon and Garfunkle, he's blind so i knew that he was very happy with this new name. (shut up, it works) So anyways, today we went to go see a movie, you might have heard of it, its called The Notebook. Yeah, it was a very chick flick, but we went with my friend who has just recently broken up (previously mentioned) so she could get her mind off of her ex. yeah... not the right movie for the job right there, the whole thing was about this summer love, who got broken up and after a while, they finally got back together and lived happily ever after. Well, we didnt pay too much attention to the movie cause we were making jokes and laughing the whole time, while our female member of the party, was curled up in the corner, we felt bad. (for a while, till Daniel (my brother) farted and we had a good laugh))Well, all in all, after the movie ended we hung around in the theater for a good while, in fear that when we left, we would be assaulted by a mob of angry women. unfortunately we were not =[ meh.   Thats all for now, till next time... you nosey bastards.

      yesterday was wednesday. But it was no ordinary wednesday, ohh no. But yesterday was a very special wednesday. Man i hate spelling out wednesday. Background: Jordan really wanted these tickets to a modest mouse concert on the fourth (yesterday) for the both of us but she couldn't get them for difreent reasons, so i came up with this little thing. I was going to have a little modest mouse concert of my own in my room. She heard one word when i was talking to her mom about it, wednesday. So like every day until then she would ask about it and beg me to tell her what i was doing. I think in her mind i was going to do something bigger than what i really did, cause i knew she had loads of anticipation built up. So when it finally came around, i'm sure she was really excited, and when we got to my room, we burst out laughing. I had set up this little stage on my counter, with 2 speakers, and a picture of the band on stage. And in front of that, was this little crowd of paper people with their arms stretched out. Behind it was a little boombox. It was a really corny and a pathetic attempt at being romantic, but she liked it i think ^_^. So it worked i guess. I was so proud of my little stage setup that i decided to keep it, until it falls apart. After that we went to hastings and i told her to pick out a cd, and they only had one MM cd. (MM = Modest Mouse for future reference) We got that one, but it only had 9 songs on it. Later she got gum on it =[. Then we went fishing with steven dan and sebastian until sunset. Then we went back to steven's and had a hooting good time ^_-. (wink* for those elite few who know what i'm talking about)   THIS IS A BIRTHDAY SHOUTOUT FOR NEGIN!!!!! August 5th   Happy birthday negin, those of you who know her, link her to this.
