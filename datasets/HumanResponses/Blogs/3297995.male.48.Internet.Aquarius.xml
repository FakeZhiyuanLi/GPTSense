      [The story thus far: our heroes have acquired a rental car, perhaps the largest car in all of France, and have somehow packed themselves and their luggage into it.]  With Ron driving, we barreled along, shouting directions and cautions to one another (and seriously, we had to speak quite forcefully in order for our voices to be understood, what with the suitcase baffles that had been set in place -- years from now, sound engineers will discover an ideal sound damping arrangement of baffles, and after a brief look at the new design I'll be able to point back to the arrangement of those suitcases and nod knowingly).  The Avis staff had offered Ron a choice of routes to the hotel: "The Somewhat Faster Way" or "The Much Easier Way", and though he was strangely intrigued by the former, he wisely stuck with the latter, and no lives were lost.  Much of Europe had been covered by a terrible storm the week before - France had been particularly hard-hit.  There were trees blown down all along the roadside from the recent storm. In some places it looked like whole fields of trees had been blown at least 35 degrees out of true, and it didn't look like they'd just grown that way either, because they were nice, straight trees, just with this odd list to them.  There were also many nice, straight trees that were lying uprooted on the ground, or already gathered in bundles. One estimate said that parts of France had lost 1 out of every 10 trees; it was easy to believe.   Our hotel was situated in the La Defense business district outside Paris, and we found it without trouble.  It's quite easy, in fact -- if you're coming into La Défense from Paris (or from the Peripherique highway, as we were) it's the first building in on your right after you cross the Seine river.  I'm aware that the previous sentence is probably (much) funnier to me than it is to you, but you have to understand that everything in La Défense is built to a gigantic scale - it's a bit like referring to the "first mile-high alien monolith on the right."  In fact, our hotel (Novotel) shares its building with Ibis, a different chain of hotels, so that things will be to the right scale.  I liked the Novotel that we stayed in. It was well laid out, with toilet and bath on the left as you entered, and ample clothes-hanging and folded-clothes storage on the right.  Then double bed and additional convertible bed on the left, and on the right, additional storage, a TV, a Robobar and desk area.  The phone had a jack in it for connecting your laptop computer to the Internet, and there was also a public Internet terminal in the lobby, which was pretty great except that it had an ASERTY-style French keyboard that approximately doubled composition time.  One unusual thing about the hotel room (to me, as an American) was that the toilet was in its own separate room, away from anything else, such as the bathtub or sink.  Actually, to call it a room would be to be using the wrong word; I expect that European designers have a special word for it.  Let me describe it:  First of all, it was _exactly_ big enough to hold the toilet.  Imagine your hall closet.  No, imagine the hall closet that you had in the first, smallest place that you ever moved into after moving out of your parents' house.  Now cut that space down by 10% or so.  Finally, add an optional head-banging feature on the inner door handle of the tiny toilet room door (which teams of designers apparently worked long hours to place at the optimal head-whacking angle and location).  Also be sure (while you're imagining this) not to add a lock to the head-whacking door handle -- apparently you don't want to be locking toilet doors; perhaps it's a law.  And at any rate, if you were actually in there, in the toilet room, it's not as if anyone could have opened the door inward with you in the way, so there.  The washroom also had some features of interest (yes, a second paragraph about the bathrooms). The tub had a shower on a hose, which was a quite nice Shower Massage-type with the ability to be perched either low or high, but it required the strength of ten men to actually engage the shower:  if you left it alone, you got a bath, or, if you brought a troop of strongmen into the washroom with you and got them to gang together, you could engage the shower.  I actually have the strength of eleven men, and so was able to cope.  Others members of our group may have engineered a system of pulleys and levers - I forgot to ask.  And clearly there's no engineering reason for this massive force to be required, unless perhaps because they decided to spring (  The room's decor had a definite IKEA aura to it (a large Swedish home furnishings conglomerate; see http://www.ikea.com/ for more details if you're unfamiliar).  Perhaps IKEA really does represent the current trends in European style?  Or, more sinister: perhaps IKEA has already taken over France, in the same way that McDonald's restaurants have overtaken the United States.  Ron and Georgia had nice views of the Seine and the Eiffel Tower from their room.  Larry and I got views of the La Defense business district, which is actually much more interesting to look at than the American equivalent.  Some of my coworkers reported problems with their thermostat, which were fixed the next day, and also Larry's phone went insane and refused to delete messages - a problem which the night guy was unable to fix, despite heroic efforts, although again it was fixed the next day. The staff were uniformly pleasant and helpful, actually. And really, I'm making a big deal about the bathroom (hey, I got to mention it in another paragraph!) but I'd happily return there.  La Défense is a business and shopping district marked by enormous buildings; my guide book said that zoning laws prevented large buildings from being constructed in most other parts of Paris.  It's designed so that there is always a fairly open space nearby, so you don't get the claustrophobic feeling that you get in the large-building districts of most American cities.  The central feature of La Défense is La Grande Arche, an enormous geometric arch that is actually an office building. Photographs don't give you a sense of scale, but you could easily fit all of Notre Dame cathedral under the Grande Arche.  I've uploaded some photographs of the La Défense area, along with some additional descriptive text.

      PRELUDE  About a year ago, the company that I work for, Xylan Corporation (relatively small at 1,500 people or so) was bought out by Alcatel, a hundread-year-old French telephone equipment maker. It's been a wonderful buyout experience so far, and one nice thing about it is that other groups at Alcatel have been interested in using part of our Java framework, which is good for us.  However, it turned out that the very best part of working for a huge multinational company is that they might  suddenly say to you, "You need to take a trip to Paris.  We will pay."  And here's how great my boss Ron Traver is:  It was originally suggested that we fly out on Monday, arrive Tuesday morning, take meetings all day Tuesday through Thursday, and then fly back on Friday, arriving home Friday afternoon.  Ron had them check prices for alternative bookings, and it turns out that the arcane airline pricing rules are quite bizarre: for us to fly out and back Mon-Fri as originally scheduled would be $2,000 per person, but for us to fly out on Saturday, stay a week, and fly back on Sunday, was only $700 per person.  And since the hotel cost in winter is only about $108 per night, this meant that it would save the company about $1,000 per person for us to stay the additional days.  Of course, the down side was that we would be "stuck in Paris" for three additional days, with nothing scheduled but to be tourists.  As you can imagine, we were pretty thrilled.  THE TRIP OUT  The trip to the airport was fairly uneventful, except that the van that my friend-and-coworker Larry Helmerich had hired to take us to the airport arrived an hour early, and our credit card payment information, which had faithfully been in their computer the night before when they called Larry to reconfirm, had disappeared from their computer system. The driver told us that they had just had a new system for handling reservations and payments installed, during Christmas week in fact. Why, you perhaps are asking yourself, would they do something so completely insane as dropping in a new computer system during their absolutely busiest week of the year?  Simple: a week later, the calendar was going to roll over to the year 2000, and their old computer system was scheduled to turn into a pumpkin - it was absolutely not Y2K compliant. The new system wasn't failing utterly, as the old one would have, but it still had plenty of bugs to work out.  One of the facts of life of modern business travel, especially on international flights, is trying to wangle yourself an upgrade to Business Class.  While not as decadently luxious as First Class, it's still pretty great, with seats that really recline!  Of course, the airlines would have much rather packed people into the plane like sardines, so they charge THROUGH THE NOSE for this.  There are various ways to get yourself an upgrade without having to pay, such as using your frequent-flyer miles, but there is also something magical that is available to business travelers for large companies, called a free Special Services waiting-list upgrade.  There are various hurdles to jump through, because they'd really rather that you paid for your upgrade, but in the end, you may be a lucky winner.  Of course, balancing this is the chance that you may be stuck flying out back in steerage, packed like cattle, and indeed with at least the fear that livestock may be traveling with you, for a 12-hour flight.  We had arrived plenty early (at 3:00 PM for a 6:00 PM flight) so as to be at the head of the waiting list, but it turned out that they wouldn't actually be putting us in the list until about a little over an hour before the flight.  Then, to our horror, we realized that one of our Vice Presidents was flying to France on an unrelated matter.  It's an unwritten rule, of course, that you get in line for your upgrade in accordance with your status in the organization, so he definitely got a free cut to the head of the line within our group.  As time went on, though, the VP got nervous and ended up just paying for a Business Class upgrade on the spot - thousands of dollars, but you don't want to be stuck back in steerage.  This business of waiting-list upgrades via Special Services is subtle and arcane, with many places that you can go wrong. For example, we had been warned in advance that if we somehow did not meet the approval of the airline personal at the gate, such as by not being dressed nicely enough, or just not looking businessy enough, that they would simply execute a pocket veto and suppress our upgrades - "Oh, I'm sorry sir, nothing became available."  We had taken this advice to heart - neatness counts - and they had happily stolen our tickets from us to be enqueued in the waiting list.  So we were a bit dismayed when our boss Ron went up to check on the upgrades for himself and his wife, and came back armed with delicious upgrades, only to have them tell us, when we asked about ours, that "We're not giving them out yet; just a few more minutes and we'll see."  A few minutes later, the gate person walked up to Larry and me holding both our tickets and said, "I have good news and I have bad news -- one of you gets the last remaining upgrade.  Take one of the tickets from my hand and pick the winner.  Who will choose?"  Larry had six months seniority over me at the company, so I felt like he should get to choose. And....(drumroll)....D'Oh!! He picked his own ticket.  I hung my head in despair, and laughed ruefully and said, "Well, the next time this happens, it will be my turn to be the Chosen One.  None of this picking tickets."  And suddenly, the gate person says, "Let me see what I can do," and steals back both our tickets.  A few minutes later she walks back smiling and says, "I just couldn't leave you in Tourist with all your friends flying Business.  Who's got the best seat NOW?"  And she handed me my First Class ticket.  Heaven opened its gates and a company of Angels sang hosannas -- all part of the service, sir.  Keep in mind that our VP had now paid about $4,500 for his Business Class ticket (because of his cash upgrade and the fact that he wasn't staying over a Saturday), and I was sitting with a golden First Class ticket, cost: $700.  He can't have been too happy about it, but we all thought it was pretty darn funny.  I would like to take a moment to say that First Class on American Airlines on international flights is just fantastic.  It is literally true that my feet couldn't reach the seat in front of me, even if I extended them fully in the air straight ahead of me.  Almost too much leg room, if you can imagine that.  The seats basically reclined all the way down to fully-horizontal, at no inconvenience to the person behind you.  If I hadn't seen it in person, I simply would not have been able to imagine such luxury in a commerical flight.  The other main difference was that they absolutely would not let up with the beverage service: "Oh, your drink is empty, sir, would you like another?  Would you perhaps enjoy trying a different wine this time, perhaps the Premier Grand Cru?"   In France, at the airport, Ron talked to Avis about our pathetic luggage situation.  When I had found out that Ron was planning to try to squeeze all four of us into a single "Large" rental car, I had immediately dropped down to using Sean's smaller suitcase instead of my own quite large one.  I didn't think there was any way that we would able to get all of our bags into the car, but I wasn't going to be the one who spoiled it for everyone else.  Still, it looked grim: four adults, four full-sized bags, several smaller bags, and some carry-ons.  When Avis asked us how big a car we would need, Ron pointed to our bags, now dominating the airport floor, and said, "Big enough to carry all those bags."    They gave him a free upgrade to the next bigger size car, and as we were walking out with our luggage, Larry asked Ron, "So, what kind of car did you end up with?"  "Well, it's some sort of big BMW."  "Oh, you mean like a 700-series?  Wow, that might actually work!"  Have you ever seen the little cars they drive in France? What would they imagine a "Larger" car to be? It turned out that they'd given us their "Big Car" in France: a BMW 320d.  This is the smallest BMW that you can even BUY in America, other than the 4-cylinder two-seater sportser.  It's a full two series smaller than the 700-series.  It is NOT going to hold our bags, but Ron is optimistic -- perhaps there is a way.  Larry and I found this such an outrageous claim that we immediately adopted a strategy of Open Mocking: while our actual boss was personally manhandling 70-pound luggage bags and trying untold various combinations, we were standing off to the side laughing, and bemoaning the fact that our cameras were packed away.    At least ten minutes later, and possibly fifteen, Ron hit upon the Golden Combination of bags: the two smallest big bags in the trunk, along with all of the other small bags, and the two largest suitcases in the back seat, sitting in there lengthwise (the most natural way to put a piece of luggage in the back seat), except that they were side-by-side, so that they both shared the middle of the car.  Luckily, Larry and Ron's wife Georgia are small persons, so they were packed into the back seat on either side of the luggage. Ron drove, and I was free to navigate in the passenger seat.  Your own pitiful imagination can not imagine how full that car was -- we actually had difficulty in the front seat hearing the people who were sitting in the back seat.  Larry couldn't see Georgia, Georgia couldn't see Larry, Ron couldn't see out the back window at all -- he had to rely on Larry's shouts.  But, we didn't have to take a taxi (astounding), and it was still better than steerage on the plane.  Next Installment: Paris!

      [The story so far: Our Heroes have secured snug transport, scary and delicious food, and comfortable lodgings at Novotel in the La Défense section on the outskirts of Paris.]  Monday morning Ron and I got up early (6:30 AM local time) and walked through sector 1 of La Défense, basically walking to the Grande Arche and back.  Explored the storefronts, most of which were still closed, of course, and bought some items from one of the many bakeries that were opening up.   I swear, we only walked about 1 kilometer as the crow flies, and we hit three bakeries, all packed with Parisians.  Everything that I tried was wonderful -- hot and fresh and delicious.  After our walk, the four of us regrouped at the hotel for the buffet-style breakfast, which I didn't really need after the bakery goods, but which I bravely enjoyed nevertheless.  Apart from the bacon and soft-boiled eggs that were available as a nod to the English and Americans, it also featured an assortment of pastry, an assortment of bread and jam, and an assortment of cheese, as well as orange juice, grapefruit juice, Danone yogurt (our "Dannon" yogurt is their subsidiary), and something called fromage blanc ("white cheese").  And, of course, plenty of Café au lait.  To my surprise and delight, the toaster that was set out for our use was a Dualit! I've always had a secret lust for this toaster, but at $459 for quantity one, it remains firmly outside my reach, unless I can snag a used one for a reduced price on eBay.  You can see the Williams-Sonoma catalog listing at:      http://www.williams-sonoma.com/cat/pip.cfm?itm=1219625  So, imagine my joy at seeing it awaiting my every command.  Sadly, my first command was apparently, Brulée le pain! ("Convert the bread into ash.")  While the bread didn't actually catch on fire, it was an incredible simulation -- certainly good enough to suit everyone present.  We'd paid good money for a extraordinarily large motorcar, and thought we'd better get the use of it and drive ourselves to Versailles.  The results were mixed, although not actually tragic.  Later we found that we could have gone straight there by taking one of the R.E.R. outskirts trains -- there was even an R.E.R. station at the Grande Arche.  Still, it was fun, even exciting, to drive.  Most exciting of all were the roundabouts (the traffic circles).  I'm sure that you've heard about them, perhaps you've seen them in Boston or London.  I can't remember what they were like in those other places, but the ones in France have no lanes; you simply head in (people who are heading in have a tiny bit more right-of-way than people who are already in) and then you move forward, edging people out and being edged out in turn.  The tiny cars were a clear advantage here.  A coworker later told us a story about taking a taxi in Paris and watching in terror as the taxi driver drove straight into the roundabout (actually perpendicular to the other traffic) until reaching the innermost border, then following that border around the circle, then heading straight out again, again completely perpendicular to the rest of the traffic in the roundabout.  At any rate, Versailles is only 15 to 25 miles away from Paris, so it wasn't long before we arrived at the town. Yes, Versailles is an entire town -- at one point, during the height of the palace construction effort about 300 years ago, there were over 15,000 workers who were employed to create the palace and its grounds.  The palace is easy to find, however - once in the town, you simply follow signs that point to the "Chateau".  We found a large self-park parking lot, with a sign that we (or indeed, anyone) could almost entirely translate: "Parking reserved exclusively for «autocars»."  Now, "automobile" in French is la voiture, and "bus" is l'autobus -- this autocar business was, seemingly, some other way of saying the same thing.  There is quite a bit of this in French, especially where an English or American word has crept into common use, even though the Académie Française does not approve.  We looked at one another and said, "Surely we are in an 'auto car'?" and drove into the (entirely empty) automated self-park.  As we were getting out of our car, we noticed several other cars parked in a different lot, further away.  Hm.  Versailles, it turned out, was closed -- they're always closed on Mondays.  We had, at a conservative count, maybe ten guidebooks to Paris between us, and no one had thought to check.  Well, we could perhaps still examine the grounds, which are unbelievably lush and enormous.  Alas, it was not to be -- the grounds were closed for repairs due to damage from the recent storm.  We took a few photos and walked back to the car.  When Ron went to the parking lot's vending machine to get a ticket that would open the gate and let us out, he was horrified to see a sign demanding 180 French Francs - that's $30!  I found out later that an autocar is exactly the same as an autobus (they even use the same vehicles for both), except that an autobus takes you around within a town, and an autocar takes you to another town.  Woof, thirty dollars for thirty minutes of parking! Plus, the machine was being truculent about accepting paper money.  Have you ever tried to come up with $30 in coins while far from home?  Take my word for it, it's a challenge.  We were darn lucky that all of us had exchanged a bunch of dollars for francs only the day before -- we were able to pay the ransom and make good our escape.  For the rest of the day, Ron was driving in the bus-only lanes, figuring that he'd paid his dues.  (Well, just the one time, actually, and it happened by mistake, and he only drove in the lane for the one block that he was trapped in it, but that's how we like to tell the story.)

      [The story thus far: our heroes have navigated their way safely through the minefields of car rentals and viciously-designed European washrooms and have emerged: washed, tanned (we're from California), and hungry - above all, hungry.]  We met at 7:30 on Sunday night and strolled through La Défense, making our way up to La Grande Arche.  For some reason it was not lit up during our stay -- no one was sure why not, although we didn't ask anyone who actually worked there.  From there, we turned around and walked back through La Défense 1 and across Pont De Nuilly into Nuilly itself.  We could have taken the Metro, of course (in Paris, you're never more than 1/2 kilometer from a Metro station) but we felt that the exercise might help combat any jet lag, and anyway, it's fun to walk through Paris, even on its outskirts.  We stopped at a restaurant more or less at random, trying to avoid any apparent chain resaturants or any foreign cuisine.  On that night, we wanted French food!  The one that we selected, like several others that we saw later, had both a "bar/pub"-like area, and a more formal "pure restaurant"-like area.  We sat down in the bar/pub area and asked for a menu, and were immediately confronted with the fact that none of us knew French, even though I took four years of it at school and have been studying it again recently.  It turns out that names of foods are not high on the vocabulary list of words that they teach you in school, despite their importance in real life.  After our waiter felt that we had struggled with the French for a decent amount of time, he offered us the English Menu, which was admittedly a great help, but which you have to be careful of relying upon, because it often has fewer and less interesting items on it.  I had already decided that I would try The Scary Foods while in France, and so tonight settled on the Boeuf Tartare.  If you've never had it, it's a raw hamburger patty (by which I mean completely uncooked - grind up your meat, and you're done!) mixed with a raw egg, various spices, etc.  Larry Helmerich had had Steak Tartare back in the states, back when you could get it here, and pronounced this one to be superior.  Yes, I know, I was taking my life in my hands, but at least I wouldn't have to worry about Mad Cow disease swimming over from across the Engish Channel, unless, of course, there were illegal pirate cows being dumped on the European market - that does give one pause.  It was pretty tasty, actually, but not something that I imagine that I could develop a craving for, at least, not in the same way that I crave Hot Fudge Brownie Specials from Ben & Jerry's ice cream shops.  As the bar/pub area became full, some Parisians were seated at our table with us.  Even though I'm somewhat shy, or perhaps because I am, I liked this - it's a great way to meet new folks, and to have an excuse to talk to them, even though they're stangers.  They said hello very pleasantly, and later on, when Larry noticed one of them using the same nerdly personal digital assistant that the three of us from Alcatel use (the Palm V), we chatted with we them about that for a bit.  As Larry observed later: no rude French people so far.  For dessert, I ordered crème brulée (a custard that has been scorched with a blow-torch -- it's become quite popular in America in the last 10 years or so).  Although it was extremely good, and subtly different from the American versions in ways that I cannot describe, I almost immediately suffered from Buyer's Remorse when I saw that one of my tablemates had ordered something called Profiteroles, which I can not describe adequately, other than to say that they involved pastry, chantilly cream, chocolate, and being super-delicious.  Actually, because we're all on the web, I can point you to a web page that has a nice picture them, along with a recipe for the pastry:       urlLink http://saveurs.sympatico.ca/ency_8/cacao/regional.htm   The text reads, in part: "Henri IV had, among his favorites, a mistress named Profiterole. To please her, he invented a light pastry, filled with chantilly and sprinkled with hot chocolate sauce.  Nowadays, the pastry is often filled with vanilla ice cream, but that recipe is not original."  After a short stroll back to our hotel, we retired to our rooms and slept uniformly well, and awakened easily.  Where was the fearsome jet lag that we had heard so much about?  It seemed that this would not be a problem -- and how wrong, how horribly and foolishly wrong I was, to think this.

      I went to the retinal surgeon today, and he liked the looks of my eye.  He took me off of the pressure-control drugs that were giving me bronchitis (because my pressure was down from 40 or 27 to a superb "10").   I can breathe again!  Also, he cut the combination steroid / anti-biotic drops from 4x to 3x per day, so he's obviously taking moves to wean me off of those.  As for my vision, the gas bubble is still there, but is very small - it now takes up only (the bottom) 10% of my visual field in my bad eye.   The retina seems nice and flat -- for example, I have no trouble at all reading the tiny print of (say) the Wall Street Journal   I can do this either with my glasses off or with them on, although it's much easier with them off.   In fact, my main complaint now is that my prescription for my bad eye (the one recently operated on) does not seem to match my eye very well any more, although it's still early days to be shopping for new glasses.  Other than that, I notice more glare in the bad eye (mostly due to the gas bubble), and more cloudiness (probably mostly due to some tiny debris still floating in the bad eye).  But these are minor complaints, and should both resolve themselves over time.   The surgeon praised my constancy in keeping my head down over the last two weeks ("I can tell by how clear your lens is that you were very careful about this.")  But, the big take-home news is:  I can go back to work tomorrow, I can drive a car, I can read a book or a CRT screen, I can put my head in any position I feel like putting it,     and... I can sleep in a bed like a natural man (albeit with my Alien-like Sleep Apnea machine).  This last is The Big One. After two weeks of sleep deprivation, sleeping sitting up in a chair in the living room, to be finally be back with my beloved sleeping machine.  Ah, bliss.

      My right eye still has a big gas bubble in it, which plays hell with focus. I was thinking at first that this was tears (as in 'crying', not the other word which means 'rips') in front of the eye, but now I'm pretty sure that it's the gas bubble. I can tell you, though, that I have exactly four fingers and a thumb on each hand, and that they can wiggle, which is much more than I could have told you on, say, Thursday.   The Big Deal will be:  (1) Did I have much retinal death from the detachment, or nerve death (glaucoma) from the increased post-operative pressure? The answer in both cases is "Probably not."  The detachment was small and for a short duration, and the increased post-operative pressure was only 40 at its worst, and fell rapidly with medication and as the swelling in the eye abated.  (2) Is my retina now tacked down nice and flat, so that I have a good flat projection screen? Here, I just have no idea what the answer is -- we'll just have to wait for the gas bubble to go away so that I can focus and try to read.  When the surgeon looked at the retina (sneaking looks with lenses and mirrors or something to avoid the gas bubble) it looked good to him.  The eyedrops that were prescribed to lower post-operative inter-ocular pressure are giving me bronchitis, which I despise. Great gluey coughs, and when you finish one your feel like you have to start another right away. The manufacturers actually killed some asthmatics with their eyedrops, according to their product literature (although applied topically, the medicine disperses systemically). Also, the darn eyedrops slow production of new vitreous humour, meaning that they slow the elimination of the gas bubble.  In the meantime, I'm keeping my head down for the next 9 days to avoid cataracts, and as I may have already mentioned, you can't keep your head downcast, and walk with your feet shuffling along, for very long, without it affecting your soul.  People ask me how I will spend my time, sitting in my chair with my head down, and I reply, in my best Jose Jimenez voice, "Well, I plan to cry a lot."

      On Saturday afternoon, July 8, I started to see thousands of dots and big ropey floaters in my "good" right eye (as opposed to my "blind" left eye that had had a retinal detachment 25 years before), but then it was better on Saturday night.  The dots came back Sunday morning while I was riding my bike with my good friend John Blackburn and his sister-in-law.  I joked that perhaps I was going blind, and that later on they'd be able to say that "We were there to see it -- how we laughed!"  I had already decided to go see an Opthamologist on Monday, but then at about 6:00pm Sunday, I started getting a lot of the big floaters and my vision in my right eye deteriorated catastrophically to a cloudy mess (and by the way, if you want fast service at the Emergency Room, "Sudden Catastrophic Loss of Vision In One Eye" is a real door-opener; "Right this way, sir."  They didn't even finish taking all my paperwork before sending me back.  Initial reports from the ER Doc were not good: "I can't see anything -- it's all orange in there."  He paged a retinal surgeon, who confirmed (as expected) that my right eye was bleeding internally (hence all the floaters and dots, and eventually total cloudiness).  The retinal surgeon couldn't see well enough into the eye to tell for sure what had happened, but he thought it was a bleed without a detachment, and he told me to come to his office the next morning for an ultrasound and possibly he would freeze part of the eye to stop the bleeding  He said that the eye is actually pretty good at clearing small amounts of blood from the vitreous humour, and that I should regain all or most of my vision in that eye.  The next morning (Monday) I went into his office, and he did the promised ultrasound, and showed me pictures of the retina, which was plenty detached.  He said that he'd have to operate that night (!!), and that they would stick instruments (straws) into my eye and remove the bloody vitreous gel.  This would be replaced with saline solution and a sulpherous pressurized gas to force the retina back down against the eye wall, where they could use cryo (super-cold) probes to kill parts of it, which would create more scar tissue and tack it down.  I arrived at the hospital Monday at 4:30pm, and they were  completely surprised  to see me then -- the doctor had intended for me to go over to the hospital immediately, but the directions that he had given me said to go there at 4:30pm, so now they were just racing, racing, taking blood, doing EKG's, completing the pre-operative physical, and by the time the anesthesiologist was ready to knock me out, they still didn't have the blood work back.  So, the surgeon and the anesthesiologist looked at each other, and said, "He's 44! He's healthy!"   I offered that I had ridden 100 miles on a bike in a single day twice that year, and the anesthesiologist said, "Ok, you're healthy in my book, and don't let anybody tell you any different! Let's go!"  They took me into the operating room, and we're just chatting, and then I guess they put me to sleep for about 5 minutes while they paralyzed my right eye and inserted the straws and other microsurgery instruments into my eye.  Then they allowed me to wake up for the rest of the surgery, but I didn't realize that I had ever been asleep or that anything had happened, so I started to chat and they said, "No, no, no, not now, we have things in your eye now."  So I stayed quiet underneath my blanket.   My whole body and face were covered except for the eye that they were working on, so it was a bit cadaverous for me under the blankets. So it was simultaneously scary and boring for about two hours.  Plus, they were having trouble, which I could listen to because I was perfectly lucid.   The retinal detachment was small, but there was also a huge retinal tear -- about a 1/4 of my retina was flapping around.  When they were done operating, they asked me if I would like to spend the night at the hospital, rather than going home immediately as per the original plan, because the operation had taken much longer than expected and I was likely to be in pain (and in the hospital, they can give you delicious Demerol shots).  I said sure, and was really glad I had.  Tuesday morning I checked out of the hospital and went to the retinal surgeon's office for a follow-up.  He looked in and said that it looked good so far.  So now I have to keep my head down for at least the next several days, and possibly as much as the next week, while we wait for the gas bubble to dissipate, and for my eye to manufacture new clear vitreous humour gel to replace it.  This is because if the gas has too much contact with the lens, it will cause a cataract (which might happen anyway).  My inter-ocular pressure is high (which is good for the retinal detachment), but it's too high (which is bad for glaucoma) so I have to take medicine for now to lower the pressure.  My current status is that I have totally unfocused and dark vision in my right eye.   I'm typing this using my left eye, the eye that for 25 years I've called "my blind eye", but which I'm now going to call my "excellent eye".  Thanks to everybody for the cards and flowers -- it makes a huge, huge difference, when you're in pain, to know that people are thinking of you.  More news as it happens.

      You know, I'd stop writing these things if they would just settle down to end with, "...and the boy and his retina lived happily ever after,"  but it's just been slightly more 'interesting' than that.  I guess the main thing that I want to say about Week 6 is that I got to go back to work again.  And also, I'd like to tell you about a visit that I made to Dr. Tran's office that week (my retinal surgeon -- he's got an actual name):   My vision was coming back again, and I was generally feeling quite chipper, and so, as I was following his assistant Linda down the corridor to the examination room, there was a slight, but definite, spring to my step.   Mentally, I was whistling a cheerful tune.  Linda turned around to look at me as we walking.  She shuddered slightly, and said, "Oooooh...don't bounce!!"  After that, it was easy to shuffle along again.  Which brings us to this week.   On Tuesday, Dr. Tran looked inside my eye and said, "Well, my friend, you have got another retinal detachment."   He turned away to write a few things on my chart, and I joked, "You're thinking: I'm gonna remodel my kitchen on this guy!"    The gold standard of treatment, as mentioned before, is the mysterious 'scleral buckle,' which permanently changes the shape of the eye so that it is not as prone to ripping itself apart any more.  And, as Dr. Tran had said before surgery #2, "You  really  need one."  During surgery #2, he had only been able to use cryo and the gas bubble to tack down the immediate failure, without being able to make strategic corrections.  Dr. Tran's theory was that the swelling that prevented him from accessing the eye the last time could be avoided this time by (a) having me take some steroids leading up to the operation, and (b) giving me a general anesthetic instead of injecting the tissues around the eye with a lot of local blocks.   He would be repairing the specific detachment with cryo and laser, and then he would heroically try to put a band around that eye.  One nice thing about the Modern Era is that a scleral buckle no longer involves retracting the eye from the socket (ew, gross!), the way that it did 25 years ago when I had a buckle put on my left (excellent) eye.  Instead, they snake the band around between the eyeball and the muscles. Less violent in general, much faster recovery, and less chance of damage to the optic nerve.   He operated on Wednesday, and the surgery was a complete success.  Dr. Tran also made the comment that they couldn't have fixed my Giant Retinal Tear if it had happened 25 years ago -- they didn't have the necessary gas bubble technology then. I remembered that they told me 25 years ago that they had only learned how to fix my left (excellent) eye's problem 15 years before that, and I feel very lucky indeed -- both eyes missed being irreparably blind by mere decades.  I've now got a big gas bubble in my evil eye, just like after surgery #1, and yes, I'm sentenced to the chair, looking down for the next several weeks.  But hopefully this will be it (or at least, if I could get another 20-30 years respite, that would be extremely nice).

      When we last left our hero, he was back at work, and was whistling a happy tune (if a little unsteadily, because of the painkillers).  After three weeks the gas bubble in my eye disappeared, and I was (briefly) in heaven.  By this time, I could read quite fine print -- some just-slightly-older colleagues were saying, "Hey, even *I* can't read that!"    There was a brief scare the third weekend after surgery, where my eye started to hurt like anything and I had to go into the emergency room again.   (Which, by the way, was the wrong thing to do, as I found out later.  I *did* need emergency help, but I should have just called my retinal surgeon, even on a weekend, and he would have had me meet him at his office -- they've got better equipment and training there, of course).  My epithelial layer (which is the onion-skin thick topmost layer of the cornea) had sloughed off, probably due to an infection.   I was given a different, additional antibiotic, and it seemed to get under control, although my vision was set back about a week, because of the damage to the cornea.  Still, at about the beginning of week four, I stopped needing the painkillers, and was extremely happy to have my mind back 24x7.  Which brings us to the next weekend, four weeks after surgery.   I had gone out and bought new glasses, and was really quite pleased.   I was back to almost 20/20 vision, being able to read about half of the letters in the 20/20 line, and all of them on the line above it.  There is an old saying that I like: "Those whom the gods would smash down, they first raise up."  I had noticed a wavering shadow in my vision, and because I was completely gun-shy now, I called my retinal surgeon, even though it was Sunday.  I was a little embarrassed, because this would be three weekends out of five that I was seeking emergency eye help, but better safe than sorry, and what it really looked like to me was another detached retina.  He listened with interest to my description, and said that he thought that it was probably just from all of the freezing that he'd had to do -- "You'll have a shadow there.  Still, come into my office tomorrow morning; I'm glad you called."  It turned out that the next morning he had to treat a bad emergency, but he was able to see me that afternoon.  "Ah, you've got another retinal detachment.  I want to operate on you again as soon as possible today.  Wait here please while we try to line up an operating room.   Hopefully we'll be able to get started in about two hours."  Ok, now a warning to anyone who had been reading this up to this point.  The next part will make you say, "Ewww, gross!"  What he wanted to do was to put a scleral buckle on my eye, which was the same thing that had been done to my other (Excellent) eye 25 years ago.  At that time, the procedure involved them popping your eye out of its socket, tying a band (a sponge) around it like a belt, and then putting the whole mess back in your eye socket.  The operation was only 15 years old when I got it, and apparently techniques have changed somewhat, but that's a fairly close description.  Apparently, my eyes need a nice permanent belt to keep them from wanting to rip themselves to tiny bits.  He had wanted to do this in the operation of a month ago, but couldn't because of the Giant Retinal Tear.  Now that the tear was tacked down and in place, he wanted to put in the buckle, "because you really need it."  I ended up at the same hospital as before, and even though the medical center is only two blocks big, with a single street down the middle, I still got lost on the way to the hospital (I'm a famously bad navigator).  There were lots of other adventures: I ended up getting shuffled around between rooms, was forced to listen to the Jerry Springer show due to roommate channel preemption, and they lost my underwear while moving my clothes between rooms.  (The aide in the retinal surgeon's office, having asked "How was your stay in the hospital?"  was somewhat flustered to hear this.  "You mean you're not wearing any underwear right this minute?"   "Oh no, I never said that.   As far as you know, I have a spare pair that I have always kept in my car, just for any emergency that might arise.")  As for the actual surgery, this was somewhat unsuccessful.   He was unable to retract my eye, either because it is still too swollen from the last surgery, or possibly because there are some adhesions from when they performed cryo on that eye 25 years ago.  He even made an episiotomy-like cut in the side of the skin next to the eye, trying to make more room to get the eye out, and couldn't. The only positive thing that he ended up doing, as I understand it, was to inject some gas into the eye to raise the pressure, to hopefully force the retina back down to where it belongs.     My status now, a week after my second surgery on this eye, is that I have no idea what my vision is like in my eye, because there's a medium-sized gas bubble in there again.  Also, it still hurts a lot (way too much to try walking around looking at things), and I'm popping painkillers with enthusiasm again.  When the retinal surgeon looked at the retina on Thursday, he said that it was either back in place or mostly back in place, but he couldn't really get a very good look, even after giving me numbing eye drops.   He also gave me some eye drops to keep my eye always-dilated for the next (get ready) two weeks!  I'm walking around, inside the dark house, with my eye bandaged, with my blind-guy sunglasses on, and still cringing, vampire-like, at the light.  His final advice to me, as I left Thursday, was, "Don't look down."   Faithful readers will remember that the first operation's aftermath featured near-total down-looking.   Not with this one, except at night, because he's trying to get the swelling under control.  (My eye is comically swollen -- if it continues much longer, people will be calling me "Mad-Eye").  And by the way, girls:  every man that I've told this story to, so far, has, without exception asked, "What's an episiotomy?"

      I saw the doctor again today -- he continued to say that my retina looks great and that my lens is continuing to improve.  My pressure has dropped to 12, so he reduced my Cosopt dose from twice to once per day.  This should speed up the production of fluid.  He told me to be sure to continue looking down, which puzzled me at first, because I felt like I had about 45% fluid in my eye, which was about where he told me not to worry about it after the first operation.   However, another puzzling thing has been the fact that my focus has remained at about 1/4" from my eye (giving me an excellent view of the hairs on my nose, but nothing else).   He has maintained all this time that, well, my eye still has a lot of gas in it, and that after there is more fluid, I'll see more normally, and I just felt as if, "No, I remember what it was like before at 45% fluid."  So, on the way home from the doctor's, I noticed, just at the very tippy top of my vision, the return of a normal (for me) focus distance in this eye -- I can clearly focus on fingers held a half foot or so from my hand (without glasses).   So, I realized that I still have MUCH less fluid in my eye than I had though -- it's more like 20% or so fluid at best (after four weeks!), and I'm only now starting to get some meaningful amount of retina that is illuminated by light that hasn't had to pass through gas on its way to the retina.  Sooooo: the good news is quite good (retina looks great, lens continues to heal, normal vision finally starting to return as eye slowly fills with fluid, and the rate of fluid production should increase now with the drug reduction), and the bad news is just the same darn old thing (gotta keep my head down).

      You probably haven't heard about the critical nationwide rattlesnake anti-venom shortage (and just as well, you're probably thinking). Well, it's true - the only company that manufactures anti-venom in the U.S. shut down their factory in February for upgrading, and they don't expect to be back on line for at least another month or so. There was a story about this on National Public Radio last month, with one poison control center saying that they would normally like to have 10,000 units on hand to meet demand for the rest of the season, but that they only had about 45 units. A single bite can take 125 units to treat, so that's not much of a stockpile.   The company that made the anti-venom wouldn't say how many boxes they had left in their stockpile, but they were releasing them on an emergency need basis.  This used to be a worry in my life, because during the week of August 28, I was scheduled to be going on vacation with Sylvia, Sean, Sylvia's mom, and Sylvia's brother Bill's family.   We would be rustically ensconced amidst the big trees -- giant sequoias, in fact.   There would be happy hikes among the trails, perhaps featuring fatal snakebites - mmmmm.  But, alas, it was not to be.   After my third eye operation, only the week before, I again had an eyeball that was filled with dangerous, lens-corroding gas.  I wasn't even supposed to go above 4,000 feet (pop!), and the pass leading into the campsite was at 10,000 feet (kapow!).  Still, no reason why Sylvia and Sean shouldn't go -- this vacation had been planned for months.   So, they left me alone and lonely, forlornly sitting in my chair, looking down.   (Everyone asked several times if I would be ok, and I assured them that I had an adequate support network).  This was a good excuse for me to try http://www.homegrocer.com   , and to take advantage of their introductory offer: $20 off my first order and free delivery, too.  (If you try them, be sure to mention me, Tom Chappell  -- I'll get a $15 kickback for referring you).   It was an unalloyed pleasure -- the smiling, uniformed delivery man arrived in his attractive, peach-decorated van, brought the groceries up to the door, slipped on little plastic bootie covers, and carried them into the house.   All of the items were first quality, even the meat and the produce.  I didn't do very much cooking, though -- it was mostly a life of looking down.   My good friend John Blackburn took me for my one-week check-up, and the doctor said that the good news was that the retina had excellent luster, that the cornea was healing nicely, and that the band (a.k.a. the buckle) that he had added was well positioned and nicely indented.  The bad news was that long acquaintance with the evil sulphurous gas was causing my lens to develop a bit of a cataract ("almost unavoidable, after that much gas exposure").  He did say that young people ("and I include you in that category") quite often heal these kinds of cataracts, and in any event, he could deal with a cataract, if the darn retina would just stay in place.  My mother, after all, has artificial lenses in both of her eyes, and drives all over the mountains daily.  I was still in an amazing amount of pain.   I asked the doctor about this, and he laughed and said that I had been in much more pain after the second operation, but that people (mercifully) don't remember pain very well.   I took my Vicodin and waited for time to pass.  Finally, about eight days after the surgery, I was able to take off my eyepatch without screaming, "The Sun! The Sun! Ahhhh, what a world, what a world...."    John and his wife Karen had me over for a delicious dinner, and a rousing game of Scrabble afterwards.  I'd like to say again how much everyone has helped me over the past 10 weeks, particularly my wife Sylvia and my friends Larry & Sally, Ron & Georgia, and John & Karen.  You really know that you have friends when they go out of their way to help like this.  At this point the vision in my evil eye was weirdly cloudy, and I was again reduced to being able to tell that people have fingers on their hands, but not how many.   I was plagued by an extremely peculiar horizontal line across my vision that mysteriously came and went, and also, sometimes I thought that I could see (clearly!) evil debris and corruption on my lens. This mystery was solved a few days later, when I realized that between the effects of the buckle, the swelling, and having an eyeball full of gas instead of liquid, my natural focus distance was about 1/4 inch away from my eye -- I was focusing in on my eyeglass lens (which was sometimes dirty), and on the topmost rim of the glasses, which I could see perfectly sharply. Nothing else was in focus, though.  Two weeks after my surgery, I again saw the doctor and he still liked the look of the retina. I hadn't seen much evidence of very much fluid production yet, but he said that this was normal because of the kind of gas he put in my eye -- the especially long-lasting kind!  It turns out that keeping your head down, and having gas against the retina, is very important for giving the retina a chance to heal properly -- it's not just a good idea because of keeping the lens wet. The cataract didn't look too bad.  He said that I didn't have to be paranoid about walking for exercise, and gave me permission to work, but said that I would have to remain paranoid about working, because of the temptation to not keep my head down -- it's very important to keep it down.   I ended up going into work for three days and helping my teammates prepare for going to France   I couldn't take the plane over because of the gas in my eye (kaboom!).   I ended up staying at home the next week, but was able to attend the last few hours of each day's meeting in France over the telephone.   And all this time I've been keeping my head down, using a special flat-panel display that I've purchased, and looking at printouts.  The pain has been all gone since early this week, and at this week's check-up the doctor again praised me for having kept my head down, and said that the cataract in the lens had improved quite a bit.   My eye is still probably 85% gas (he used the long-lasting gas!), but I was noticing today that if I was looking down, I could easily count the number of fingers on my fully-extended hand, and in general everything looks much less dark and cloudy.    I'm starting to become less apprehensive about the ultimate conclusion to this whole affair.  I probably won't send another bulletin out until the gas is completely gone and I've gotten a new eyeglass lens for my evil eye, which may be quite a while yet -- possibly several months (although I'll be able to hold my head up high long before then).     If you don't hear from me, assume that everything's going well, and I'll certainly send a short update by Thanksgiving.

      First, the good news:  I saw my retinal surgeon, and he DIDN'T say,      "Tom, you need to have one more operation on your eye."  Isn't that splendid?  I think that's splendid.    Now, the bad news:     He DID say, "Tom, you need to have two more operations on your eye."  Details:  The operations are not scheduled yet. He wants to wait until I'm fully recovered from the earlier operations (which I assume means gas entirely gone and not taking any medications). I'm down to putting in one kind of eye drops (Cosopt) once a day, and the gas looks like it will be gone in about two weeks. I don't know yet how long he'll want to wait after that before the cutting begins.  The first problem is that the cataract is getting worse now, and will just continue to get worse. The whole cataract thing is a fairly common result when they have to use the gas in the eye. In fact, it's my understanding that 35% of operations that involve the dread gas end up with patients getting cataracts. My retinal surgeon doesn't do cataract operations, but I'm sure that he can recommend someone.  The second problem is that I'm seeing a nonlinearity, a permanent waviness, in my vision (as opposed to a shimmering waviness). This is a macular pucker, a thin membrane of non-retinal cells that have found their way to the top of the retinal layer (probably as a result of the previous detachments and surgeries, although that is not the only situation that can give rise to a macular pucker). Anyway, this membrane is growing on my retina (as opposed to shrinking, or remaining the same size), which is bad, or course, and plus, it has an inherent tension and strength which causes it to pull the retina toward it, much as if you grabbed a portion of your shirt in your fingers and bunched it up. So, this membrane is incredibly thin, and what they will do is to wait for it to "mature", and then they'll go in there and peel off the errant membrane. Spalding Gray has done a fairly hilarious monologue on the subject of his macular pucker (see his video, "Gray's Anatomy"), which was actually the source of that 35% statistic that I mentioned above. My retinal surgeon WILL do this procedure himself.  Dr. Tran, my retinal surgeon, told me: "You know, by an astonishing coincidence, I had a guy like you last summer, who also a programmer, and who needed several surgeries to correct his retina, and developed a cataract and macular pucker, and I ended up getting him back to 20/20," so don't lose heart.

      Yesterday was my cousin Linda's birthday, so I sent her a Birthday Howdy, and she replied:   Can't believe I'm 52 -- isn't it amazing how time flies?   Well, here's the biggest shock in that area that I've had recently.  You remember Rosa Parks? Of course you do.  On December 1, 1955, she refused to give up her seat on the bus to a white.  When I was a kid, her story was constantly drummed into our heads during Black History Week (later to become Black History Month in 1976 as part of the Bicentennial, but that was after my time).  I remember thinking of her as an old black woman who had had enough.  A feisty old black woman, built on the lines of The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie.  Ok, but she was born in February 4, 1913 in Tuskegee, Alabama, which makes her 42 years old at that time.  As a 45-year-old myself, I'm somehow no longer thinking of 42 as being the age where feisty, colorful Old Folk careen around in a rickety and amusing manner.  Some day soon, I'll come to regard 42-year-olds as being hot babes.

      You may recall that I had had pretty darn good vision after my recent cataract surgery, and I was (exceedingly) happy.  But my vision gradually degraded, as 50% of all cataract surgeries do, due to a clouding of the membrane that separates the lens from the back of the eye.  It was a gradual, but in the end, quite noticeable decline in acuity.  Well, I just got back from a quick outpatient procedure to correct this, and it couldn't have been more trouble-free.  To destroy the errant membrane, they shine multiple laser picobursts into your eye (about 20 to 30 of them), each one of which causes a pressure wave that punches a hole through the membrane.  Actually, a great metaphor that the surgeon used is that you should imagine a tightly-stretched film of Saran Wrap.   If you take a pin and pop a hole in the film, you'll get far more destruction than just a little hole, because the film is stretched so tightly.  So, I sat down, and he aimed his laser this way and that, popping the film with his laser bursts, until the membrane was essentially destroyed.  It was slightly startling, because I could FEEL the shock wave in the eye (like throwing a stone into a calm pond).  It took about three to five minutes - I didn't have to change out of my street clothes, even.  Many have asked, "Don't you need all of your various body parts? Wasn't that part there for some reason?"  Well, it does more or less hold your lens in place, but the artificial lens that they put in during the cataract operation is sufficiently anchored down after 6 to 8 weeks that they can proceed with the destruction of the membrane.  And the results?  Amazing.  Using my evil eye, I after the operation, I could read the little badges on the cars with the brand name spelled out ("Mercury") from a distance of several car lengths.  And, for actual before-and-after comparison, I had put a large book (The Way To Cook, Julia Child, hardcover) against the piano and had seen how many paces away from the book I had to be before I couldn't read its title any more.  All tests were made with the evil eye open, and the excellent eye shut. Before the operation, WITH my glasses, I could just read the book title from about 8 feet away.  After the operation, WITHOUT my glasses, I could read the book from 10 feet away, and WITH my glasses, I could still read it from 23 feet away.  I might have been able to do a little better, but I ran out of living room.  So, almost a three-fold improvement in acuity, like going from 20/90 to 20/30.   Naturally, I'm thrilled.  (Even as I'm writing this just now, I can't help being tickled at how sharp everything looks).  I'm pretty confident now that even should my excellent eye suddenly have some horrible mishap, I would still easily qualify to drive with just my evil eye, especially if they would consent to clearing the freeways every morning and evening for my convenience.  And it's clearly good enough for me to be able to depend on it for reading and working, even should the other one fail.  The evil eye still has the dread macular pucker (the scar tissue on the retina, which makes things a bit wavy), and I'm still taking eye drops every day to prevent the retina from swelling, and my eye still LOOKS a little evil, but from the inside looking out, I'm deeply satisfied.  The retinal surgeon has no intention of operating on the macular pucker any time soon, so hopefully you won't hear from me about my dopey eye for a long, long time.  -Tom

      I left Georgia Tech lo these many years ago to accept a job, thinking, "I'll finish the degree out in California; how hard could it be? I only need two classes."  Well, it has turned out to be pretty hard.  Georgia Tech has a rule (the 50-Hour Rule) that the last 50 hours of your coursework have to be completed at Georgia Tech, and then there's the 10-Year Rule, which states that all of your coursework must be completed within a span of 10 years.  I had checked with UCLA a while back, and they had a similar rule, but maybe it was the 15-Year Rule...at any rate, as far as everyone was concerned, my previous coursework was now nothing but waste paper.  But then I was helping Sean apply to various colleges, and one of them was Califronia State Northridge, the only four-year college in the San Fernando Valley, and it occurred to me that I'd never tried them...and they didn't have a time limit!  At least, not officially.  So I applied, and jumped through all of the hoops.  I had ask the ETS for a copy of my old SAT scores because who remembers those (Verbal 630 + Math 750 = 1380), and today I got word that I have been accepted!  They had to give me a Special Exception, because I'm really supposed to have taken Public Speaking already if I'm transferring in, but since this wasn't a requirement at Georgia Tech, they're going to just insist that I take it as part of my first semester there.  Anyway, I'm back!  Watch out, little baby college students!

      Classics of Software Engineering: "Design Patterns"  (One of a series of short reviews on books which have profoundly affected my own programming style, and which have made me a better Software Engineer)  Design Patterns Gamma, Helm, Johnson, and Vlissides (The Gang of Four) Addison-Wesley, 1995  This book was the one which finally unseated "Software Tools" as my own personal "Most Important Software Book I Ever Read."  It is THE modern classic of Object-Oriented Design.  It is really so famous at this point, so very well known, that any praise is likely to be met with the response, "Well, Duh."  But the flip side of that is that if you haven't yet read this book (perhaps because you've been on the Moon for the last few years and have never heard of it), you are at serious risk of being left behind.  As early as 1996, I was already being asked in job interviews, "So, which Design Patterns do you prefer?"  You'd better have an answer for that question.  So what's all the fuss about?  Design Patterns are simply time-tested organizations of objects which solve certain problems in certain ways.  Just as you would pick a well-known sorting algorithm rather than trying to derive your own, you need to be familiar with ways of organizing objects which others have already found to be useful, and what their pluses and minuses are.  Instead of code reuse, or algorithm reuse, we're talking Design Reuse.  One of the most well-known examples of a Design Pattern is Model/View/Controller from Smalltalk-80, which is actually a higher-level Design Pattern built on several smaller ones.  Consider the problem of a word processor which would like to support, as Microsoft Word does, being able to split a window into multiple panes so that the user can have several different views of the same word processing file.  If the user types in one view, the changes must simultaneously affect the other views of that same document.  Another example of the use of alternative views would be Microsoft Excel, which can represent the same data as a set of numbers or as one of a variety of graphs. How can we achieve this?  The Model/View/Controller pattern does this by separating these three aspects of the problem into separate objects.  A Model object holds information about the document's contents.  It knows all about the contents of the document, what words and pictures are where, but doesn't have any information about a specific view of the data.  Instead, for each pane which corresponds to a view of the document, a View object is created, each of which has a reference to the same instance of the model object.    Views have all of the information that is specific to a given view: the zoom level of the view, its scroll position, etc. The Views are also registered as Observers of the document Model, which means that whenever a change is made to the document Model (for instance, when a character is inserted), this change is announced to all interested Observers (in this case, each of the Views).  So, whenever the Model is changed, all of the Views get notified, and can update their displays.    Finally, a Controller object encapsulates the way that a View responds to user input.  A view can change the way it responds to the user by swapping out the Controller object for a different one.    Design Patterns examines a relatively small number (20 or so) of fundamental patterns of objects IN DEPTH.  For each pattern, the book looks at the overall key features, the implementation details (presented in both language-neutral UML and as actual sample code), the pros and cons of the pattern, a few examples of where it has already been used in the past, and how it is related to other similar patterns.  And don't overlook the first section of the book.  Many people do, simply because the larger second half, the catalog of patterns, is so outstanding, but the first section is filled with valuable information in its own right.

      (One of a series of short reviews on books which have profoundly affected my own programming style, and which have made me a better Software Engineer)  When I was getting my B.S. in Computer Science the first time, 26 years ago, I was one of an exceedingly small number students at Georgia Tech who were using this brand-new tiny little operating system called UNIX, out of Bell Labs, which ran on DEC PDP-11 minicomputers (about as powerful as a 25 MHz 80386).  Within this group, and all across the country, this book set off detonations like little neutron bombs.  My old friend Michael "Bobby" Tague still calls it "The Most Important Software Book I Ever Read" -- for my own part, it held that title until being unseated by "Design Patterns" in the mid-1990's.  Continuously in print for 26 years, Software Tools teaches Structured Programming, example by glorious example.  To quote the front cover:  "Good Programming is not learned from generalities, but by seeing how significant programs can be made clean, easy to read, easy to maintain and modify, human-engineered, efficient, and reliable, by the application of common sense and good programming practices.  Careful study and imitation of good programs leads to better writing."  [That's outstanding prose right there.]  The authors, who had already written an exceptional book, The Elements of Programming Style, reached in Software Tools a level of greatness which we students had not even previously conceived, much less experienced.  They started out the book mired in the hell of FORTRAN, an environment which many programmers of that day, including even the bulk of the Computer Science Majors at Georgia Tech, were stuck in.  They then said [paraphrasing now], "but why would we limit ourselves to that horrible programming environment as the primary tool we use in our everyday work, when we can easily improve it?"  They described a new language, Ratfor (for Rational Fortran), which was little more than FORTRAN with C flow-of-control structures, improved comment support and C-like libraries of functions, and wrote a simple little preprocessor which converted Ratfor to FORTRAN. They then rewrote the Ratfor preprocessor in Ratfor, and ran it through the original FORTRAN version, and had bootstrapped themselves a programming environment that, while not UNIX, was (literally) an order of magnitude better than the one they had been stuck with previously.  And they shared their work with the world, by making all of the programs in the book available by nine-track tape, letting computer centers the world over bootstrap themselves into a dramatically better environment in a matter of hours.  In this slim volume, they consider the design of at least a dozen significant programs, designing and writing each while you watch.   Topics such as top-down design, structured programming, egoless programming, pseudo-code, testing stubs, etc., were all taught by example.  Most amazing was the collection of complete, significant, highly-readable programs that had been written by the end of the book, including a text editor, a word processor, and the Ratfor preprocessor itself.   Topics such as sorting and parsing were covered as by-products along the way.  If you like to read books about programming, or want to be a better programmer, pick up this little book.  Even if you don't know FORTRAN, you'll find the programs a breeze to read, as long as you know C, C++, or Java.   urlLink http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/020103669X/

      (An e-mail to my Linguistics Professor and her aide)  Dear Linguists,  Alright, but now that my mind is opened, how do I close it again?   My friend John Blackburn and I were chatting, and he tried to say, "unmanaged code" (talking about computer software) and it came out sounding like "unmanaged goat", and I couldn't stop myself from thinking, "Sure, [k] and [g] are both velar stops, and yep, that's an assimilation error: the voiced [d] ending 'unmanaged' influenced the unvoiced [k] beginning 'code' to become voiced.   As for the alveolar stops which were swapped at the end, I don't know why the last [d] in 'code' decided that it wanted to flip over to become its unvoiced partner; that might be a listening error on my part."  YOU did this to me!  Seriously, though, I am having such fun listening to speech for phonological transforms.  There's virtually nothing as cool as understanding why stuff happens.  -Tom

      My nephew Craig is applying to several universities to try to get into their Ph.D. programs, and some of the professors were flaking out on him, promising glowing letters of recommendation but being slow about it. It got down to the final day (the letters had to arrive the next day), and he still didn't have the letters.  Let's let him pick up the story from there:   I ended up running around like an idiot at the last second trying to get that recommendation:  Phone Call:  "Anderson University campus security."  "Yeah, my name is Craig Burt and I know that Dr. David Murphy has taped a letter of recomendation to his door for me, but the outer doors are locked and I need it to be in another city tommorrow."  "I'm sorry, you'll have to come back tomorrow."  "No it needs to be there tomorrow, I can't pick it up tomorrow, I have to overnight it tonight."  "I can't open the door."  "Listen, you can watch me the whole time and I won't do anything but take an envelope off the door that has my name on it, you can have my license, hey you can hold my whole wallet. For that matter you can keep a pint of my blood, handcuff me and I will take it with my lips."  "I will lose my job if I let you in."  "Do you have a supervisor that wouldn't lose his job for doing me this favor?"  "No."  So I went down and asked the director of admission for help, he called the guy, had him come over and made jokes as he got there sorta mocking the guy: "You want me to come along in case he starts getting out of hand?"  I had to drive to another professor's place and was instructed to forge the signatures of the other two recommenders (by those individuals themselves). I had to rush to FedEx, arriving about one minute before they closed at 9:30, and they were wonderful to me, so it is all sent off.  Hopefully I get in, but my part is done.

      I had been simmering, waiting to go to two restaurants, for many months. One was a long-established vegetarian restaurant in Canoga Park, "Follow Your Heart," (at the corner of Topanga Blvd. and Sherman Way) and the other was the tantalizing "Chili My Soul," which Chris Gibson had alerted me to some months before.  Today, Sylvia left me in the house alone, and went off to see her friends with my car. I put new tires on her car, and then thought that I might drive it for a longer test drive. Where to go? Chili My Soul is much closer to home than Follow My Heart, so off I went.  First, I called them to see if they were perhaps closed for Easter weekend. But no: AND they had a recording of what chilis were available that day (!) I was tremendously excited when I heard about the Curry Chicken Chili, which decided matters for me. I arrived, and found that the place had been expanded into an adjoining space since the L.A. Times had written their review. They now have at least 10 tables, plenty of space. It was uncrowded when I arrived at 5:30 or so on Saturday night.  They have quite a generous tasting policy, so I first tried the Curry Chicken Chili, rated 7 out of a possible 10 hotness. ("Crave the exotic? This mystical blend of Mid-Eastern and Indonesian curry and Western chiles gives a unique twist to this non-traditional spicy theme.") Not too hot at all, and extremely delicious.  Next, I tasted the Gunslinger Chili, an 8 ("Onion-free Western style chili with lean ground beef, bacon bits, and baby pinto beans with a 'take no prisoners' bite. This thick chili stands up to the palate of the most discerning chili connoisseur.") Not bad at all, but I opted for the Curry Chicken as my first choice. I had a cup, rather than a bowl, but they brought what I could only call a small bowl. Who knows how big a bowl bowl might be? For my three free toppings, I picked Parmesan Cheese, Cilantro, and Sour Cream. I also had a choice of bread, and picked cornbread. The meal came with several carrot and celery sticks, a tasty dip, and a slice of orange. Soon, all that had been wolfed down.   More, must have more.  I went back and sampled Fusion Pepper Beef (a 6: "Ground white, black, and Szechwan peppercorns are infused in a red chile broth to create an intensely unique chili with just the right heat to bolster its complex flavor.") Flavorful, and full of peppy pepper taste. Then I tried Tecate (a 6: "Savor the flavor of malted barley from premium Mexican beer with a touch of cinnamon in this 'South of the Border' beef and bean chili with distinctive warmth and character.") This was quite unusual: I felt that I could really taste the beer. It's meant to be quite good with chocolate chips, and I'm going to try that next time I go, but I didn't have that as my 2nd cup this time. I then sampled Espresso Black Bean (a 4: "Spicy and zesty, this all vegetarian ultra-low fat chili is enhanced by the unmistakable aroma of premium de-caff espresso and earthy-rich Jamaican black beans, garlic, and lime.") I don't think that my sample was really big enough, and I'm going to sample it again next time I go.   There were miniature Tootsie Rolls in a bowl on the counter, and I was liberally eating these "to cleanse my palate" or something, or perhaps "because I really like them."  I settled on the Fusion Pepper Beef, on top of a Knockwurst ("Steamed all beef Kosher knockwurst on a soft French roll topped with your choice of CHILI MY SOUL® Gourmet Chili; melted cheddar and onions on request. A knife and fork affair with extra napkins"). I had it with Cheddar Cheese, Cilantro, and Onions. It was OK, but I think I would have preferred another cup of chili instead -- the Knockwurst doesn't come with the cornbread, carrots, celery, and orange, and I had enjoyed those. Plus, I like to be able to pick up a chili dog, and maybe I just expect the flavors to be more standard, and to not cost $10. So, I don't think I'll repeat the Knockwurst.  On the way out, I sampled the Demon chili (a 10+: "Six of the world’s hottest peppers set this fiery beef chili aflame. This is the one for the true 'Chilihead' who can never, ever get enough heat. Sample this flavor last. We’re warning you!") Really, it wasn't as hot as I was expecting. I'm sure that I could finish a bowl of it -- I'm pretty sure.  I brought home a quart of Curry Chicken chili with sides for the troops.

      A few months ago, the city of Lancaster used their power of eminent domain to condemn a 99-Cents Only Store that had opened up in the same shopping center as the CostCo there.  CostCo claimed that they needed the space to expand, and threatened to move out of town if they didn't get it.   The city caved, citing "possible future blight" (because legally they can condemn a building to eliminate blight).   A judge has frozen the action, saying that it was one of the most naked examples he'd even seen of using public power to hand property over from one private party to another private party.  The city vows to appeal -- I saw an interview with the city attorney, where he said that CostCo paid 10 times the tax to the city as the 99-Cents Only Store, so "Which store sounds more important to you?"  Property rights and Rule of law be damned, I supposed.  Sean's only comment on the whole sorry affair: "Only Lancaster could be blighted by the removal of a CostCo."

      Happy Boxing Day (still true on the West Coast, though I'm writing from North Carolina),  My departure to and from LAX couldn't have been more hectic.   I got up at 3:30am, because we really needed to leave by 4:30am if we wanted to be at the airport 1 1/2 hours before departure time.  When my alarm went off, I started gathering together the last few things that I needed and putting them in the suitcase, but then I went to check my e-mail and found that my e-mail server, which runs in my house, had crashed for the second time in a day, and it should never crash.  So, I lost vital minutes trying to figure out what was wrong there.  I may have fixed it, because it hasn't crashed since, but we'll see.  Anyway, between that and everything else, we were really running late, and didn't actually leave the house until after 5:00am, and didn't arrive at the airport until 5:50am, and this for a 6:50am flight.  But, I went into the airport, and the e-Ticket line was moving quickly -- excellent!   I said to the guy in front of me, "This doesn't look too bad!"  He swiveled around and pointed at another, much longer and slower line: "Yeah, but then we have to get our luggage checked in the security line."  Yikes.  I ran up to the e-Ticket dispenser.   There were big signs: "If your flight leaves sooner than 40 minutes from now, you'll have to get another flight -- we won't print out your boarding pass."  Quick, look at the watch: Ack, 45 minutes until my flight.  I entered my information, "Checking two pieces of luggage," got my boarding passes, and ran over to the security line, which miraculously was much shorter, now -- excellent!  But wait: where were my sticky suitcase routing labels?  I'd forgotten to get them!  They are printed out at the same time as when you print your boarding pass, but must be attached to your luggage by the airline personnel.  I ran back to the e-Ticket machines, where they were calling my name.  Two minutes later I was back in the security line, but much, much sadder, because the security line had nearly doubled in length since I was in it just a few minutes before. Rats!  I called Mom to let her know that I might not make the flight, and told her that I'd call her back with a status update.  30 minutes to go. What to do?   There was a nice young Asian couple in front of me; the woman didn't seem to speak very much English, but the man spoke good English.   They were looking at their watches, and obviously discussing what to do.  The guy went up to the federal marshals and asked them, pointing to his ticket, and a few seconds later he was running back to get his wife and their luggage.  "Hey, when does your flight leave?" I asked him.   "6:50am, to St. Louis."  He was on the same flight that I was!  I figured if he could go up, then surely I could, too, so I followed them up to the head of the line.  They were really looking at people's luggage carefully, but the marshal just asked me, "Is your luggage locked? No?  Ok, you can go on -- we'll check it out."  20 minutes to go. I walked over to the stairs which would take me to gate 40, but another marshal was there, telling me to go to another stairway about a feedball field away, where a line was coming all the way down the stairs.  I was behind the Asian couple again, and again he went off to ask a marshal about letting us go forward.   He waved to us, and I cleared a way through the crowd for his wife.   Up the stairs we ran.  We'd probably cut out over 150 yards of this line, but now there was another lot of line curling around and around like Disney World. Again he checked with a marshal -- sure, come ahead.  15 minutes to go. We're going to make it!   I was emptying my pockets for the scanner, but then I wondered -- should I send my Apple iPod through the scanner, or not?  It might hurt it, and it's expensive.  The guy at the scanner smiled and said, "Oh yeah, just put that on the conveyor belt -- it won't hurt it.  And don't worry about emptying your pockets, it's OK."  This last was bad, bad advice.  The body scanner beeped when I walked through it (cell phone!), and I was immediately sent to a velvet-roped Penalty Box. This was Not Good.  A marshal came over, grim-faced.  "Sit down over there, Sir."  Worse, worse.   I was thoroughly scanned, and then, "Stand there, with your feet on the pictures of feet.  Where are you from, Sir?  Los Angeles, you say?  That's funny, you don't sound like you -- oh, you grew up in the South? I see..."  He turned away for a moment.  Meanwhile, my iPod is just sitting over there, unattended, and did I mention that it's expensive?  But wait, I'm tall!  I reeeeach over to pick it up -- see I didn't even have to move my feet!  He turns back, sees the iPod in my hand; I'm not trying to hide it or anything.   "Was that scanned?   You're not supposed to pick anything up until I'm through with you. Now I've got to go scan it super-thoroughly.   Wait there."  Ack, ack, ack.  My iPod and I are given the green light.  We run to the gate; less than 10 minutes to go.  All of the passengers are already in the little tunnel that connects to the plane, and at the end of the line, there is my Asian couple again.  They smile when they see me: "You made it!"  But the woman points at a bag that both of them are holding, and the man says, "Oh, go back and get your Bistro bag."  Apparently, airlines are now weaseling out of meals wherever they can, and instead there is just a goody bag in a big cooler.  You're meant to just pick it up as you walk by.  I went and got mine; I had been helped by the Asian couple 4 times in one flight!   A woman arrived in line, even later than myself.   "Oh, hey, don't forget your Bistro bag," I was able to say.  She smiled at me as if to say, "Thanks, Super-Competent Person!" and went and got hers.  Perhaps you saw on the news, it turned out that there was what the U.S. felt was a credible threat of an attack on a flight from Paris to LAX, though some French officials thought that it was all overblown.  As I understand it, they had intercepted a lot of chatter about this Flight 68 from Paris to LAX, and then on the flight manifest they found 3 passenger names matching known Al Queda or Taliban, one of whom was in pilot training).  I guess they made some arrests, but most of those guys didn't show up for the flight.  I don't know much about any upshot.   But that's why security was so tight at LAX.  I suppose that next time I'll be sure to arrive many hours in advance, but in the case of the other night, all that I think would have happened would be that I would have stood in line a lot longer before being sent to the head of the line.  Still would have been less stressful, though. I guess the real thing to do is to arrive way, way, early, maybe three hours early, and just go get some food and so forth after getting past security.  Hope that everybody had a good holiday.  -Tom

The alternative is to issue a non-conflicting set of addresses in the same subnet until the old addresses expire.  DNS:     * Don't forget to put in the final periods in the name of the domains, the SOA record fields, the NS fields and the MX fields, etc.  FTP:     * To change the umask of the FTP server in 10.3, cd to /etc/xinetd.d, vi ftp, and add a -u0002 argument.     * Set up sharing points in Workgroup Manager.  Set sharing values for each protocol.  SSL:     * Got a $39 SSL certificate from StarterSSL?     * When ordering certificate, use browser/SSL combo...Apache/Leam?

      I went to see the CSUN Graduation Evaluation department today.  They have a physical office, but I'd always called them on the phone.    "When will you have my Grad Check done?"  "Oh, well, you submitted your Grad Check application late--"  "--late, six months ago--"   "Yes, yes.  So, we should have an answer for you in four to six weeks."  "But when I asked you this same question in early March, you were telling me mid-April, so that was six weeks at that time, and it's mid-May now, and you're still telling me four-to-six weeks..."  "Well, you have to understand, Mr. Chappell, you *did* submit your Grad Check late--"  "--late, six months ago--"  "Yes, yes.   Well, another way to put it is that we are currently working on the forms submitted in September and October."  "Ok, so no chance whatsoever that it will be done in four to six weeks. What about Commencement? Do I still go?"  "Oh, sure!  You just go, 4:00pm Thursday, June 3.   I mean, nobody gets diplomas at Commencement.  We haven't had a chance to evaluate the grades by then.  Everyone just gets a handshake.  The people who submitted their applications on time can expect to get their diplomas in July or August."  "Alright, I see.  I'm not going to hold my breath.  Thanks."  "You're welcome."  Larry Helmerich makes the point that back when we were in college the first time, in the late 70's, schools managed to have the diplomas ready on the day, even though computers were so very much more expensive.  Of course, administrative scum are the very last thing that donors or legislators want to pay for (they'd rather pay for buildings, or labs, or teachers, and rightly so), so in a way, I can understand.

      ...a few activist judges ruled that a "Separate but Equal" form of education for African-Americans was a clear violation of the United States Constitution.  (United States Supreme Court, Brown v. Board of Education)   Fifty years later, a few activist judges have compelled the State of Massachussetts to no longer require a separate-but-equal form of state-recognized union for gays and lesbians.    Fifty years from now, people will look back upon these events and say, "Well, of course! We're a civilized country, you know."  It's already legal in Canada  right now . For that matter, 25 years ago, when Canada was setting up their newly-independent Constitution, they passed an equal rights clause for women as a matter of course.    Of course, they're a civilized country, you know.

      WASHINGTON  - At a hearing today held by the Senate Armed Services Committee investigating the horrible abuse and torture of Iraqi prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison near Baghdad, dangerous right-wing fundamentalist idiot Sen. James Inhofe shocked those who had never before heard him speak.  "I'm probably not the only one up at this table that is more outraged by the outrage than we are by the treatment," said Inhofe, an Oklahoma Republican and well-known asshole.  "I am also outraged that we have so many humanitarian do-gooders right now crawling all over these prisons looking for human rights violations, while our troops, our heroes are fighting and dying. These prisoners, you know they're not there for traffic violations - If they're in cellblock 1-A or 1-B, these prisoners, they're murderers, they're terrorists, they're insurgents. Many of them probably have American blood on their hands and here we're so concerned about the treatment of those individuals."  When asked to explain this novel interpretation of Christ's teachings, prominent religious leaders stressed that Inhofe is an Oklahoma Republican and well-known asshole.   urlLink Globe & Mail   11 May 2004

      From my sister Jan's son Craig:  "I just checked my grades and I got the 4.0 this semester."  ...and those are sweet, sweet Graduate Degree grades!

      I heard today that "The United States Patent and Trademark Office has issued an Allowance for your Patent."  This apparently means that they agree that the application was filled out correctly, that the invention represents something new, useful, and non-obvious, and that they are prepared to issue me a patent.  Now, the only thing left to do is for Alcatel to send in a final "Gimme that patent" form along with a filing fee, and by September-October timeframe, I'll have my patent!  Well, not mine, of course, because technically I sold it to Alcatel for a $1, but the patent's in my name, alright, and it certainly doesn't tarnish a resume.  Plus, a few months later, Alcatel will get around to paying me a patent bonus, but no telling exactly when this will happen, since they're usually issued in groups every six months or so.  I can probably expect it around the beginning of the year, though.  What a month I'm having!

      I received my graduation evaluation in the mail today, and as feared, there was a crucial piece of paperwork missing that connected my Georgia Tech Mathematics courses to their Cal State equivalents, at least for the purposes of the Math minor.  That could have been corrected easily, but more seriously, the Math minor requires that 6 hours of upper-division mathematics be taken at CSUN, and I only had 3, having transferred in the rest.  I wouldn't particularly mind taking another Math course, but remaining an Undergraduate for another Semester would put a crimp in my ability to register for Graduate classes.  So, alas, I'm sending them a FAX to blow off the Math minor.  At least I completed the coursework to my satisfaction, brushing up on my Calculus, and the Numerical Methods course was extremely worthwhile.

      Here are the highlights from my final Baccalaureate Semester, and a nice surprise at the actual ceremony:  MATH 481a: In my Numerical Methods class (a class that covers how to use computers to estimate high-precision answers to higher math problems such as boundary problems in differential calculus), my Math professor achieved something I would have never thought possible, namely publicly praising me in class so many times that I actually became embarrassed.  Literally 10% of the classes included special Tom-praising sections. He sent me this note to tell me that the A was a lock, even before he'd graded our finals:  "Tom! it was a pleasure to have you in my class. I have earmarked you for an A. I don't care how you did in your take-home or your final exam. Your interest in the course and your participations during the semester has already earned your a grade that you deserve. Congratulations,  I'll keep in touch wherever I go."  COMP 429: Even though I work at a networking company, I actually learned quite a lot in my Computer Networking class.  I have managed to slip by all these many years without needing to write any code at the socket level, except for a small RMISocketFactory that I wrote at work in Java.  But the last several weeks of the Computer Networking class were all about socket-level programming, and we had to write an assignment that did a good job of covering the basics: TCP, UDP, concurrent services, simple protocol design, etc.  Here's the note that my Computer Networking professor sent me:  "Tom, you did very well for the course. Your grade for COMP 429 is A.  Your project was done exceptionally well. I gave you extra credit for the efforts you put into the project. I think you should go on and design/writing code for Alcatel switches, but getting a Master's degree is the right step toward that direction.  If I can be of any help, please let me know."  Aren't these nice letters? I was in heaven.  Then my Commencement was Thursday, and I won an award!  I had known that I was up for it -- I got a call from one of the professors to let me know that several of the professors had mentioned my name -- but during the interview he had asked me about any special things about me, "They like it if, for example, you're the first person in your family to get a degree."  I considered mentioning that my father was a Doctor of Medicine, my mother was a Registered Nurse, and my sister and her husband both have Master's Degrees in Education, "...so how about being the last person in the family to get a degree?  That's still pretty special!" But I didn't. So, maybe no award.  One thing that I had thought went well in the interview was that the professor asked me, "I see that you took Spanish.  Did you have it in High School?"   "No, I took that course to satisfy the 'appreciating other cultures in our country' requirement."   "Well, yeah, but there are probably much easier ways of satisfying that requirement than taking a college-level language course in a language that you're unfamiliar with?"  "Oh sure, but all of the other courses were things like, 'Diversity in America,' 'The Chicano in America,' 'The Chicana in America,' 'The Black Man [Woman] in America,' and so on, and I just felt like it would go a lot further towards understanding another culture in America if I took a step towards actually being able to communicate with them -- especially living in Los Angeles."  I had decided on a strategy of doing everything I could to forget the possibility of a delicious, resume-enhancing award.  I really, really wanted it, but was afraid that I wouldn't get it, so the best thing was just to never think about it.  And of course this was completely impossible, because I had told people about the phone call, so just about every week, someone would ask, "What ever became of that award...?"  But, pretty early in the ceremony, the President of the College of Engineering and Computer Science announced that the Computer Science Department's Academic Performance Award, given to one student in each graduating class, went to...me, ha ha, yes!  My campaign of not thinking about it had worked!  I beat out 188 other Computer Science graduating Seniors.  A few days later, I received the award in a nice cover (click to see inside):  urlLink     I called up my Mom afterwards to tell her, and she had seen the whole ceremony on live Internet feed!  She had even figured out what the problem was when the screen saver made the screen go blank during the middle of the ceremony, and moved the mouse a bit to bring the picture back.  My sister Jan missed the award, but got her copy of QuickTime updated in time to see me receive my diploma. What an age we live in!  Afterwards, Sean, his girlfriend Malarie, and some of my best friends and I went out for Mexican food and (in the case of the adults) Tequila.  A lovely day.  I start my first day of COMP 588, Software Engineering Economics (Summer Session) on Monday.  Two more years or so, and that Master's degree will be mine, all mine!

      This was in the news briefs section at the front of this month's CACM, the flagship magazine of the Association for Computing Machinery.  (But note that the  San Francisco Chronicle  is their primary source).  Communications of the ACM Volume 47, Number 6 (2004), Pages 9-10  Special Skills Draft   The U.S. government, despite denials to the contrary, is making its first moves toward a military-style draft of citizens with special skills in computers and foreign languages, reports the  San Francisco Chronicle . The Selective Service System, an independent federal agency, has begun creating the procedures and policies to conduct such a targeted draft in the event military officials ask Congress to authorize it and lawmakers agree. Agency spokesperson Richard Flahavan insists a targeted registration and draft is strictly in the planning stage: "The whole thing is driven by what appears to be the more pressing and relevant need today, that is, the deficit in language and computer experts." The agency already has in place a special system to register and draft health care personnel ages 20 to 44 in more than 60 specialties if necessary in a crisis. Flahaven says the agency will expand the system to quickly register and draft computer specialists and linguists should the need arise.   urlLink www.acm.org

      Quoting my friend and fellow student Alexander Vinnitsky's presentation in my Software Engineering Economics class:  [Presenting a corporate case study:] "The man put in charge of accomplishing the merger had had it made clear to him that his entire career was riding on a successful completion.    In the words of Josef Stalin,   If he succeeds, we shall have a great new machine. If he fails, we shall punish him. "

      "Jeff asked me if I wouldn't mind making some introductory remarks before we got started.  Of course, being Jeff, he didn't ask me last month, or last week -- he asked me this morning.  As Jeff explained, 'Dude, I wasn't going to wait and ask you right before the ceremony!'  So, perhaps in accordance with what I might call the Genius of Jeff's Plan, I  do  have some remarks, but they are spectacularly brief.  It's often said at this point in the ceremony, and rightly so, that marriage is a solemn promise between men and women (or in this case, between a man and a woman), and not something to be entered into lightly.  I've known Jeff for 15 years, and Naomi for almost as long as Jeff has.  They sit, in my estimation, at the very pinnacle of the ranks of 'couples who were made for each other.'  They're so good-natured, and so comfortable in each others' company, that I certainly couldn't imagine a better choice for either of them.  Naturally, there has been some give and take.  In Jeff's bachelor days, though he was a pretty thorough vegetarian, he would still happily eat fish.  As he put it, 'Fish is not meat, because I don't eat meat, and I eat fish, and therefore, fish is not meat.'  After meeting Naomi, he saw the folly of these words, declaring fish 'our furry friends of the sea,' and together they have gone further, avoiding even (with the exception of today's debacle) the cruelty of, for example, roasting an ear of corn, preferring instead to devour it alive, together.  So, to the ceremony.   [I deleted the following because it was too likely to seem inappropriate, especially in such a large, diverse crowd, but it would have been funny]: As you may or may not know, I have no special powers, other than Family Friend, Industry Figure, and Nemesis.  If I'd been a little more on the ball, I might have quickly gotten myself ordained at one of those ministry-by-mail outfits, and Jeff and Naomi might have found themselves married under the auspices of Mjumbo of the Congo.  But no. However, since they met at the prestigious University of California at Irvine, where they both attained their degrees, I have brought the Sash of Higher Learning [puts on the sash], under whose authority I will administer the vows which Jeff and Naomi will make here today.   [Vows and Rings]  Ladies and Gentlemen, I present to you today, Mr. and Mrs. Jeff and Naomi Lorenzini!"
