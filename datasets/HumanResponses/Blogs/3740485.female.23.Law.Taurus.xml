      I am a fairly open person, I realize this. But my deepest, darkest, most intimate/embarrassing tidbits are reserved for a special few.  People give up FAR too much information.  In the past few weeks I have learned that my co-worker's 13 year old son has a very large penis and balls for his age. That the cup that they make him wear for little league gives him a horrible rash in said enlarged nether region. Furthermore the boy sleep walks and inevitably ends up in his mother's bed NIGHTLY. I don't have kids, I have never lived with other kids so perhaps I'm not the most knowledgeable on these matters, but all of this info seems so wrong on so many levels. Who tells ppl these things, who would want others to know these things? And most importantly why me...what did I do to deserve this level of discomfort?  My other co-worker informed me today that she has an STD from one of her many ex-boyfriends, and the most recent ex has been rather stand-offish since learning this information.  Again...Why? Just Why? It wasn't as if the conversation began by me asking "Ever been given an STD by an ex?" In that case I can see answering honestly and with the utmost voracity but if the conversation is about a lawsuit against said ex, which has nothing to do with said STD, why bring up said STD? Just gloss over it...I'm not/won't be sleeping with you so why the heck do I need to know?  Just...do us all a favor...keep somethings for yourself and those closest to you. It will make me having to fake comfort much less painful.  In other news....  "I'm feeling SEXY, I wanna hear you scream my name, boy". My hair is pulled back into the perfect Jennifer Anniston/JLo/Gwenyth Paltro/Sara Jessica Parker ponytail. Which is no easy feat considering I'm black. However it's picturesque (I should take a picture today....)plus my makeup came out great, and I'm just all around feeling like a hot girl. Too bad I'm in Newport Beach where no one who notices would say anything to me anyway! Dah well...I know I'm fly.

      Ok so, I have always had a desire to maintain some sort of memoir, journal or the like, because I mean lets face it, I'm brilliant and my thoughts should be memorialized. Unfortunately along the way I have run into a few roadblocks:  My mother-she had to know everything, couldn't hide a diary from her to save my life. Realized a diary in my mother's house was a futile effort.   School-Some how writing major papers weekly lessened my zeal to write anything non-scholarly.  More school-Reading volumes of material seemed to have the same effect as paper writing.  But now, at this point in my life, with so much going on I feel the need to keep some sort of record of my thoughts and feelings. So much has changed as of late, and trying to sort out all my feelings about everything in my head has become quite cumbersome. So here I am about to spill my heart to an unknown audience. And I think I like it.  To some degree I feel like this whole blog writing thing is in keeping with my extreme vanity (being back in LA has made it much worse)...B/c honestly I could very easily cure this need to write with any $.59 notebook from Wal-Mart, but they apparently discriminate against women so who wants to support them!? Therefore, this is the only way.  I guess I should tell you a little bit about me to put it all in perspective. I'm 23, I grew up in Rancho Cucamonga, CA, went to college in Claremont, CA and now attend law school in Virginia. Over the past two years I moved away from home for the first time, I fell in love for the first time, I had a horrible terrible emotionally and mentally scaring break up for the first time, and had Chik-fil-A for the first time.  It's been a big two years.  This time next year I will have graduated from law school, and be preparing for the bar. Which means that I will be out of school, not just on break or vacation...But done with school. I have no clue what life is like not being in school, or not anticipating being back in school. That thought coupled with taking the CA bar has me very anxious about next summer. I'm excited to graduate, but so many things have to happen by then that its all a bit nerve racking. Que sera sera.
