       Sunday 20 May 2004     This will probably bore most people to tears. Anyone interested in getting into the mind of a raving lunatic may find this interesting. Well, that may be a little misleading, but this should provide some entertainment, at the least. It'll be a collection of my thoughts, dreams, desires, scarring childhood flashbacks, etc......   This first entry is already going to be an angry one (as most of them will be). My husband, heretofore known as "G", is watching television. Nothing unusual there. He's watching one of those annoying motorcycle building shows on the Discovery channel. Not only am I not discovering anything that I actually care about, but I could not care any less about these people and what they do. Jesse James (how original - hope that makes him feel tough) is not, I repeat, NOT, attractive. Even with a shower, shave, and about ten years of quality education, I still feel doubtful.   Remember the episode of the Brady Bunch where Bobby decided that Jesse James was his hero?? His parents, a.k.a., The P's, got Bert Mustin to come and talk to him, to try to show him that J>J> was not a man to be admired. "Jesse James killed my father."  Not only am I subjected to this horrid show, but there is a marathon, in honor of Father's Day, and our television is at full blast. G does this on purpose. He has to; there is no other reason for the television to be that loud. He knows how much I hate the noise level, and his shows, so he combines the two and usually gets the expected result: Sue's pissed. Then he can say that I'm being pissy and so he doesn't want to be around me. Then he gets upset when I talk to someone else, or someone else talks to me and I respond.   I mean, why should I care about these people's marital problems? I don't know them, and true, I feel bad if they're having problems, but I have mine, too. The difference being that I have the decorum to NOT air mine on television. Are they begging for free marital advice? They should be able to afford it, if they felt that they wnated and/or needed it.  G and I were supposed to discuss my going to southern Illinois University in the fall this evening. He has yet to bring it up. He says he doesn't want me to go to work until I can make as much money as he's making. I'm trying to tell him that I'm not going to be able to do that unless I get my bachelor's degree. He doesn't seem to see the logic. I'm just supposed to sit around in this house waiting for someone to offer me that much money with only an associate's degree.   Here's where the erratic thought processes come in. Sometimes I think he doesn't want me succeed at anything. If he can keep me here, I have to depend on him for everything. I realize that implies some problems on his part, as well. It seems like the only way I'll be able to better myself is if he's gone. However. I have told him that I want to do this for US; so we could have a better life together. The only things I want for myself are a Jaguar and a Harley. Plus my leather and silver accessories. Is that asking too much? I didn't think so. I would never ask him to buy the Jag for me; I would "owe" him. Both of us would feel that way. I want to earn it for myself. I know he is insecure with himself, and thinks that if I go on with school that I will meet someone who is more like myself and might leave him.
