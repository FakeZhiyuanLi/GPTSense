      I am in lovely Castellina di Chianti now, having also woken up early (7:30 am, a half-hour before my adjusted wake-up call!) and caught the early train to Florence.  (On the way, I finished Dario's book about his tour experiences, which I even read for a bit after we hung up last night . . . have emailed him re a tour for me and am hoping to hear from him today!  I am even willing to change my Florence plans if necessary, as I think that a tour of this area with a true local would be unforgettable.)     From Firenze, I connected to a train to CdC--actually, as CdC does not have its very own train station, landed in the nearest Dia-forsaken (see, "Sex and the City" CAN be educational!) place with only one bus a day, which was not to depart for CdC until 2pm (it was then Noon and hot as could be).  Was feeling slightly desperate (not to mention sweaty) when I happened upon the kindest inn operator ever . . . he called a (more accurately, "the") cab for me, as I had another 10 kilometres to go to this town, and invited me to share his air conditioning while I waited.  I could have hugged him, he was SO nice.  Next, I nearly lost my life in the taxi due to high speeds, narrow roads and tight curves, but I guess there are worse ways to go than gazing out at beautiful vineyards in Tuscany.  :)   Upon arriving safely in CdC (to my great surprise), I found that my hotel room here is embarassingly spacious and decadent . . . as it turns out, this is the one that is 140Euros, while yesterday's was a bargain at 80Euros (a fact I learned at checkout).  This room's view is also beautiful and there is a garden with cushioned deck chairs below that I may have to experience before my departure.  The room is huge, with stuccoed walls, wood beams on the ceiling, a huge writing desk at which one could certainly write a book if one wanted to do such a thing, a sitting area with 2 (2!) small couches and an earth-sized bed.   I have already explored most of the town and eaten at the best restaurant so far of my visit . . . the tomatoes in my mozarrella and tomato salad were so perfectly red and luscious that I almost had tears in my eyes upon seeing and tasting them.  Is that the sign of a food explorer gone over the edge?  I adored my waiter, whom I permitted to choose my entire meal for me except the salad . . . he did not let me down, as the chianti (a San Leonardio?) was lovely and the ravioli with local truffles exquisite.  We are now fast friends and I think I may even return there for dinner.

      I am in lovely Cortona today . . . it felt significantly less friendly than Orvieto until I had lunch, which was delightful (see below).  My arrival involved the as-yet not experienced on this trip "Lisa moment" in which I boarded a bus from the train station to the hotel (trying for once to be frugal and save the cost of a taxi), only to learn that my very fat suitcase would not fit through the narrow aisle.  I learned new things about the strength one acquires in an emergency situation as I had to lift the thing over a few seats so that an old lady could leave the bus.  Then I had to de-board myself in order to procure a ticket from the newspaper stand!  All of this was under the watchful yet unsympathetic eye of a curmudgeonly bus driver.  Ugh.     On the bright side, I arrived safely and my hotel room is exquisite, or at least the view is . . . a sweeping view of the valley below from a balcony onto which wood framed glass doors open.  It is breathtaking!  I also love my room, which is like a little jewel box and even has a built-in wooden armoire that reminds me of a ship for some reason (I'm not sure why, as I have never taken a cruise).  Also, the hotel has a lovely patio downstairs with a similarly splendid view, from which I plan to watch the sunset with a glass (or two) of wine.   Anyway, lunch was at a place near the local theatre (in which this internet place, strangely enough, is located, along with a pool hall), and I had nice German and American lunch companions, one of whom had a small dog in a carrier that reminded me of my law school roommate's dog.  (One thing to know about me on lengthier trips is that I go through extreme missing of my own dogs, which translates into me trying to pet nearly every dog that I see).  For the first time, I tried a local white wine (it seemed appropriate, given the warm and sunny weather), which was excellent.  This was accompanied by a nice tomato/mozzarella salad and thin pasta noodles with bits of duck woven in (you may be detecting a theme here . . . )  I also saw the largest pepper grinder ever . . . it must have been 3 feet long--yes, it's true!  Additionally, a waitress there had the most jarring yet infectious laugh I have ever heard!   Now I am off to some museums, although I am really in the mood to while away the day in a comfortable chair, gazing out at the view and soaking up the sun.  (I now am well on my way to being a tanned blonde from Tejas!).  So I will probably keep the museum visits fairly brief.  Will have to update you later on my yesterday, which was spent in lovely Orvieto . . . a wonderful place!   Arrivederci!

      (French for "I am very tired!" . . . actually, it is just my feet that are really tired)  Aussi (also), I have learned that I instinctively think and speak in French here, no matter how hard I study my Italian phrase book!  Hmmm . . . perhaps you can find out what part of the brain causes one to do that!  :)   Rome is an overcast, chilly and sometimes rainy place today.  So, I did as much as I could outdoors until the rain really threatened, then found indoor activities.  For a non-religious person, I have had a lot of religion in my day!  I slept a nice long time (much needed, and a heavenly experience!) and got up just in time to scramble to locate the meeting place for my Jewish ghetto tour.  Before meeting my guide, I had just a moment to eat a traditional Jewish pastry, washed down with a Coke, as I did not realize they had coffee until it was too late.     Met up with my tour guide, who it turns out is 20-something, rather than the old woman I had pictured.  Much to our amusement, she had the same mental image of me, so it took a while for us to figure out who each other were and begin our tour!  It was really fascinating . . . she knew EVERYONE walking around in this sort of Jewish community center, and there were a lot of people there, as they are electing a new rabbi today.  Apparently, a long-ago pope thought it better for the Jews to live in a tiny walled in area, coincidentally surrounded by Christian churches (lots and lots of churches . . . I think I counted 8, which was not all of them, and it is not a very large area).  This lasted about 300 years, until the liberation of the area, which now remains a center for Jewish life in Rome.   After I took my leave of my tour guide, I walked through the Trastavere neighborhood, which is nice and arty.  Enjoyed the scene, checked out a (relatively) small church and then located another hole in the wall for lunch.  It was wonderful!  Lots of pots and pans hanging from the ceiling, small and cozy rooms, just 2 waiters for the whole place, who were constantly on the move!  I was in a room so small it had only 5 tables.  At one of them, an old man was on a tear about something . . . I was really wishing that I spoke Italian so that I could understand what he was so insanely upset about and what response the two very quiet old ladies with him had!  Had a simple but good lunch, with pasta and then creme caramel for dessert . . . also sampled the house red, which was pretty nice.   Brimming with contentment after my nice meal, I promptly became totally lost.  I ended up at some castle, but was not in the mood to tour it.  After some angst regarding my lost state (I had not yet procured a large map of Rome and was relying only on the partial maps in my Rick Steves book), I located a TI with a great map of the city.  Before I could even study the map (I ended up chatting a bit outside the TI with a woman from Milan who tried first speaking to me in Italian (no cigar), then jumped into French when she learned I spoke that a little . . . her sister is here visiting from Lyon, France, so we chatted a bit as well), I looked up and realized that the sizeable dome in front of me could only be St. Peter's Basilica.  So, I decided to pop in as long as I was so close.  I really wanted to visit the Sistine Chapel, but it was already closed for the day, so I'll save that for next weekend.   I am debating whether to go back to the hotel for a few hours for a little rest, then find a late dinner, or to eat dinner now, take a stroll and call it a fairly early night.  I think I will do the latter, as my feet are much better rested now that I have been sitting for a bit.  Also, my internet time is about to run out!   Have a wonderful evening!  Ciao!  :)

      Here's a very short summary for you of things so far: Had a good trip, although the flight from Houston to Paris was a bit too crowded for my taste . . . made it hard to sleep well.  I feel great (if a bit sleepy) now, after arriving in Rome, discovering my room is fine, with a view of a lovely flowered patio and a very charming building, taking a much-needed shower  (best EVER!) and heading out on the town.  Had a lovely dinner (a grilled artichoke I may actually try to replicate, pasta with duck and truffles and a wonderful Montepulciano red wine) at a hole in the wall place and a great walk to various places that are all lit up at night, including the Pantheon, Trevi Fountain and Spanish Steps.  Fantastic!  I have taken some photos that I think may turn out wonderfully.     Thankfully, I am already 99% calmer and in an "I'm in Rome" frame of mind . . . very relaxed!  (I was a bit worried that I would lose a day or two to the decompression process, but apparently my mind knows that I only have a limited time here and is making the most of it!).  Well, I'm off to get a glass of wine (or gelatto . . . cannot decide!) and then a good night of sleep so I can enjoy all the things I have planned for tomorrow.  More later, hopefully .  . . .

      Gutten Nacht!  I have seen the most incredible places in the last week . . . I am not sure where to begin!!!  First, I will give a nod to Verona . . . great city, very pretty, you can almost picture Romeo and Juliet when you look at the balcony from which they (allegedly ) spoke.  Very friendly people, too . . . I received my first marriage proposal there from a guy whose last name is (incredibly) Italia and whom I had known for all of 40 minutes.  He approached me in the street and asked if he could practice his English with me.  I said that would be fine, but he would have to walk along with me to the next place I wanted to visit.  Next thing I knew, he was proposing and I, not sure I could live with the name "Lisa Italia" for the rest of my life, turned him down.  I left that evening for Vienna (by train) and flew from Vienna to Istanbul the next morning.  I hardly know where to begin in describing Istanbul.  Everywhere you look, you see minarets pointing skyward from ancient mosques (see the attached picture).  Natives constantly approach, some trying to sell carpets or postcards, some just being friendly, others interested in your blonde hair and blue eyes.  The air is filled with the smell of roasting nuts from a street vendor and apple smoke wafting from bars where people are seated on low cushions or stools and eating pita bread filled with lamb.  Periodically throughout the day, the sound of the call to prayer rings out, with a man chanting verses from the Koran.  Relaxing in a 400 year old Turkish bath, you look up to see the architecturally perfect rendering of stars and sky in the dome that protects the round, hot stone on which you lie while awaiting your bath and massage.  In brief, I loved every one of the four days I spent in Istanbul!  My hostel window looked out on the Aya Sofia, a mosque so old it is only used as a museum now.  On the way to the hostel, I met a Japanese girl who was my roommate while in Istanbul.  We met no less than three Turkish men en route to the hostel, one whose mother made us a traditional Turkish dinner that night.  After dinner, we were treated to a viewing of American Pie on a bootlegged CD . . . the movie was in English but with Turkish and Chinese subtitles!  It took me all of the first day to learn to say "thank you" in Turkish, phoenetically, tishicur iddidum.  Day 2 in Turkey included meeting Jonathan Nieuwsma's friend Muge (thanks, Jonathan!!) at the Blue Mosque.  It was beautiful and huge!  Muge then helped me select a carpet from the nice carpet seller who snagged me outside the mosque.  He served us apple tea in his shop while we looked at what seemed like a billion rugs.  He then showed us another, less accessible, mosque and took us for lunch at a traditional Turkish restaurant, where I was introduced to Ayrun (a Turkish, watered down yogurt drink that Muge loves and that I can live without).  Muge and I spent the rest of the day checking out some other sights and snacked at a place where the patrons spontaneously stood and belly danced.  Muge was able to add lots of interesting commentary on the things we saw.  For instance, she explained that the different belly dance styles we saw reflected different regions in Turkey.  In the middle of this place, women sat in front of round stones making the pita bread that they cooked on a low stove before serving it to us.  Muge and I also visited a place where several sultans and their families are buried.  As with the mosques, we had to take our shoes off in order to visit this place.  After another dinner made by my new Turkish friend's mother, I retired to the bar at the youth hostel and met a few fun Australian girls and lots of other nice travellers too.  My new Australian friend (Orley) and I visited the Topkapi Palace the next day to see where the sultans governed and kept their harems.  It was fascinating!  We then strolled to the Grand Bazaar, where the level of harassment increased exponentially from that we found in the streets.  We met a nice guy named Suat (he claims it means horse water in Turkish but was his grandfather's name)and Orley played backgammon with him while I learned the game and drank apple tea.  The Bazaar, by the way, is a HUGE Turkish shopping center with about ten aisles of booths dealing in ceramics, jewelry, carpets, clothes, etc.  The ceilings are all painted in traditional Turkish designs and are incredibly beautiful!  We ate dinner at a wine bar with our new friend Suat, his friend Hambe and Neval Ozturk, who dates my friend Gary Cerasuolo's brother and lives in Istanbul.  Dinner was great and the company was delightful (thanks, Gary and Linda, for putting me in touch with Neval, she is so cool!).  We then walked the fashionable Taksim part of Istanbul.  Much to my dismay, my final day in Turkey arrived all too soon.  Orley, Paul (from England), Ted (from Minnesota originally but Japan of late), Paul 2 (from Australia) and I took a boat to Bosphorus, which marked my first visit to Asia!!!  We crossed into the Black Sea and disembarked into a small village with a gorgeous deserted castle on a hill.  We hiked up to the castle and enjoyed the sunny weather for a while, then relaxed with apple tea in the village before taking the ferry back to Istanbul.  I scrambled in an effort to change my plane ticket so I could have more time in Istanbul, but to no avail . . . it was nonchangeable.  I spent my last evening in Istanbul experiencing the Turkish bath, admiring the way the two main mosques look lit up at night, practicing my backgammon and listening to stories in the hostel bar about a fellow traveller's adventures in Iran and Iraq and the difficulty of getting a visa to Syria.  After my morning flight to Vienna, I located a hostel and set out to find a new camera bag and explore the town (shopping is a great way to learn a city's layout quickly!).  Vienna is SO different from Istanbul: my light hair and eye color means nothing to them (yea!), the street are neatly organized,  street signs easy to find and read, public transportation is useful and easy and the people generallz keep to themselves but are very nice when spoken to first.  My favorite sights in Vienna were the Kunst Haus (a modern art museum in a cool house designed by the artist), the zoo, the Shoenbrunn and Hofburg Palaces (Bryce and Penny, you would not BELIEVE the china service!) and the opera tour.  At the zoo (the oldest zoo in Europe), I met an Austrian man who fought in World War II and told me about being a POW in the US for 2 years after the war.  I never knew we brought the other side's soldiers to the US before meeting him.  He was really nice and not bitter at all . . . the subject only came up when I asked him while we were chatting about the antelope how he learned his very good English.    My favorite activities in Vienna were seeing a Wagner opera, hanging out in a coffee house that received an award from the Emperor and having dinner in a "skeller" . . . an underground restaurant with brick ceilings and walls and acoustics that permit you to hear all the other tables' conversations.  I made another good new friend in Vienna . . . Bridget, an accountant from Canada who is halfway through her year's leave from Ernst and Young.  We met at the opera tour and then attended the opera together and tried a Sacher torte (a wonderful dessert originating in Vienna that is made with chocolate and apricot) with another Canadian named Dwaýne who we met at the opera.  Luckily, I avoided the political protests occurring in Vienna by leaving any place that was swarming with police . . . on my last night there, several people were tear gassed and injured during a protest about some newly installed conservative government members.    I left Vienna last night for Heidelburg, where I am now!  Heidelburg is quaint and beautiful, with rows of traditional cute German buildings set in the middle of a forest and next to a river.  I cannot believe my tour is nearly over . . . only three more cities after this (Rothenburg, Hannover and Paris), then I fly home!  So this is my last update for you . . . I hope I have been able to share with you some of the awe, curiosity, luck, friendship, adventure and bliss I have experienced during this amazing trip (thanks, Lon, for allowing me the time to do it!).  I look forward to returning home to sleep in my own bed, hug Kip the dog and see all of you again!  Take care and see you soon!  Lisa

      Buon Sera . . . Ciao . . . Prego . . . Ciao!  I have used these interchangeable greeting/parting/thank you expressions of Italy heavily during the past week!  I hope all of you are well and happy!  As always, thanks for the emails . . . the link to home and reality is much valued!  When I last wrote, I had left Barcelona (reluctantly) for Cinque Terre, Italy, an all night/all day trip.  First was a 3 hour train from Barcelona to the border of France and Spain, then a two hour layover in a town that consisted of . . . the train station.  I huddled with a group that included an Australian, a Spaniard, a French girl turned Spaniard, a Kansas City native and a Santa Fe resident (as well as a few bottles of wine), while we waited for our train.  I had an interesting discussion with the French bartender and one of her customers regarding the respective merits of two different French wines that were available (both from 1998 and the same region of France).  As a Frenchman and longtime wine drinker, the customer concluded that the one with .5% more alcohol was the better one . . . who was I to challenge him?  (I am not sure I have mentioned this, but in stark contrast with the United States, a glass of wine here typically costs $1 to $2 and you can get a  litre bottle of good wine for about $6).  Once we boarded the train, we discovered I was the lucky one with an entire compartment to myself (I had finally invoked my first class Eurail Pass status to get the compartment that comes free with the pass . . . one of the benefits of being 30 and no longer qualifying for the youth pass!).  Accordingly, I hosted my first wine tasting party on the road and the conductor even approved our event.  Many hours later I arrived in the Cinque Terre, a group of five fishing villages along the northwest coast of Italy (on the Mediterranean).  I hopped off the train at the first village, left my pack at the train station, picked up a picnic lunch (Neapolitan pizza and a small bottle of Cinque Terre wine) and made my way to the beach, which consisted of rocks and a harbor.  The view was amazing (and you can see it in the attached photo)!  I read and soaked up the sun for a while, then set out for the next town and my youth hostel.  Of course, the hostel was closed, but luckily there was a pension just across the square which was lovely . . . the manager, an architect, designed it.  As you know, I revel in the excellent accomodations I rarely experience, and this was wonderful . . . two words: HUGE BATHTUB.  Dinner that night was at Trattoria Billy, where the customers were me and a group of 8 Italian men . . . my first introduction on this trip to that particular species.  Billy serves a mean pesto and pasta; the Cinque Terre is the birthplace of pesto.  I spent the next day exploring the various fishing villages, each of which were beautiful and unique.  I tried to hike from my village to the next one, but the trail was labeled as "very dangerous" even though the iron gate to it was wide open.  Opting to take their word for it, rather than their actions, I took the "high road" detour.  Next thing I knew, I was on top of a terrace used for grape growing that was VERY high up, not so good for someone with a paralyzing fear of heights!  I was so relieved to find steps that would get me back to the village that I barely noticed when I passed a private chicken coop, a patio and finally an entrance gate to a home, pausing only to frantically look up the Italian words for "I am very lost, I am sorry" in my phrase book in case I was confronted with whatever the Italian version may be of the Texas shotgun.  The only repercussion I suffered was an old woman glaring down at me from her window as I emerged from the gate.  Ducking that town, I hopped a train and hiked from the fourth village to the fifth . . . it was a 2 hour hike that took me to amazing heights along the ocean (so high I could no longer hear the surf), over streams, across 8 inch wide trails, and up and down very steep stairs.  Most of the time I was alone . . . I only met 3 hikers and one native during the entire hike.  When I finally reached the village of Monterroso al Mare, I found a bacci game in progress next to the beach.  This game (kind of like bowling, with only small bronze balls and no pins) is played mainly in France and Italy, I believe, is much in favor with older men, and draws quite a crowd!  I hung out with the group watching the game for the rest of the afternoon and met a sea captain (Angelo) who spoke perfect English from his 30 years of travels that included the States and Canada and now works for Esso, an Exxon company.  That night, I checked out the Manarola nightlife with a German guy who was staying at my pension . . . we found that nightlife is not a concept well-established in the area but whiled away the time in a bar watching Italian TV shows with the owner.  We had our share of excitement earlier in the evening, however, when an American girl failed to heed manager Gabriele s warning not to touch the middle switch of the light switches and caused a power outage in the entire pension that took an hour to correct.  I left early the next morning for Siena, Italy, which is outside Florence.  On the way to Siena, I met Lorenzo, a longtime pilot in the Italian military who proudly informed me that he has taught himself all the English he knows.  He was really sweet and we talked about how badly he wants to see the United States, but that his wife is physically unable to make the flight and he does not want to go without her.  We also discussed our dogs and he admired my pictures of Kip.  It makes me laugh to think about these Italian sea captains and pilots knowing about Kip . . . I knew he was destined for world fame!  After leaving Lorenzo, I reached Siena, a beautiful old town where cars are practically banned in the center of the city.  I checked out the contemporary art museum and two other museums, the Campo (a town square where people gather to sun themselves), four churches (and yet another mass), the gelatto, Grotto Nero (a medieval-style restaurant), various shops and a classical music concert.  The concert was amazing . . . it was held in a classic theatre that had three levels of white theatre boxes trimmed in gold (it looked like a classy version of the Hollywood squares game because of the way the audience members kept looking around at each other).  This town and the pension where I stayed are among my favorites so far on the trip.  The pension was supposed to have a myna bird on the terrace that says "ciao" when you come and go, but Alessandro, the owner s son, informed me that the myna recently flew the coop.  One day, I had lunch at a great place where I was the only customer (it was late in the afternoon) and the two sons, home to have lunch with their parents, ate with them at the next table.  (This is apparently a tradition in Italy).  I laughed when the mother yelled at the younger son (who was a few years younger than me) to stop watching the Simpsons (dubbed in Italian) and get to the table.  Some scenarios are universal.  Reluctantly tearing myself away from Siena, I headed south for Sorrento, Italy, to see the Amalfi Coast.  I figured out two things: (1) the Naples train station workers need humanity training; and (2) most others I met in Southern Italy were really kind.  I had heard horror stories about men from Southern Italy and, thus, was incredibly cautious, but I met some folks who were just saints about making sure I reached my destination safely.  My first day in Sorrento, I explored the town (perched high above the ocean) and had a delightful dinner where Pascal and David were my waiters.  David is attending a high school for those who wish to make a career of restaurant work and is doing some kind of apprenticeship at the restaurant.  He and Pascal were so fun and always stopped by to keep me company when they were not busy.  The next day, I visited Pompeii, a town buried by lava when Mt. Vesuvius erupted in 62 A.D. and that was forgotten until the archaeologists began excavating it in this century.  We even were treated to a small version of the fear the natives must have felt when the volcano started to erupt when a terrible, violent rain storm with sleet and hail broke out just as we were about to enter the ruins.  After waiting out the storm, we were treated to nice enough weather to make the visit worthwhile.  I cannot believe how many frescoes, columns and statues were found intact after all those years buried in lava rocks!  They also have plaster casts of the residents who were buried in the rubble that show the terror and desperation of the villagers.  The tour was incredible and the many dogs who live in the ruins helped fill in for my dog Kip (temporarily)!    Earlier that day, at breakfast, I met an American woman from Washington, D.C.  In classic small world fashion, it turns out that she is an FDA attorney and went to law school at SMU (in Dallas for you non-Texans).  We met for dinner that night and had a great time at Ristoranti Choreale.  Afterward, I returned to the Merry Monk Pub, which I had discovered the night before, to use the computer and chat with a Brit-turned-Sorrento resident I met the night before.  I also saw the Amalfi coast . . . the road from Sorrento to Amalfi runs above the ocean and includes at least 900 curves in the one-hour drive that is the most beautiful stretch of road I have ever seen.  I set out the next day for Venice, via Naples, where I experienced the first truly dark shadow on my trip.  The trip into Naples was strange because, due to a wreck near the train station (not involving our train), we had to get off the train a few towns away and take a bus to the Naples station.  I had been warned about the dangerous atmosphere in Naples and was trying to be ultra careful, watching the area around me, being cautious of strangers and keeping my belongings close by.  When I went to the window to make my train reservation to Vienna, however, a thief stole my small backpack right from between my feet in the 3 seconds it took the window attendant to tell me to go to a different window.  I was stunned because the bag included, among other things, my camera and all its accessories, the 2 journals I was keeping, all the names and addresses of the people I have met over here and those I am supposed to meet later in the trip.  I knew I could replace the camera (and have already done so . . . it is covered by insurance), but the other items are definitely a loss I feel deeply.  Anyway, I have vowed not to let this spoil my remaining time here and now (2 days later) am feeling much better than I did at the time.  On the way to Venice, I met a nice older couple on the train and that also cheered me up.  The lady, when she learned I was traveling alone, gave me a big thumbs up, even though we could only communicate through her husband, who knew a little French.  Venice, where I am now, is an incredible city!  I love that there are no cars on the island . . . they use boats for everything, including the ambulance, firemen, vegetable sellers, UPS, water taxis, mail delivery, etc.  I shopped like a maniac yesterday to replace the key items (camera and accessories, alarm clock, lipstick, journal and notebook, backup batteries, pens) that were in my backpack.  Although I wish I had not had to spend my day that way, it was not so bad because I actually felt more like a native shopping for everyday, non-souvenir, items than I do on my typical day of museum visits and other sightseeing.  I attended a classical music concert last night in a gorgeous church with an incredible violacello (?) solo by a guy named Davide and then met some really fun Kentucky girls in a pub on the way home.  Today I reverted to the tourist role, visiting the huge St. Marks basilica with its gold- and jewel-encrusted altar piece, treasures stolen from Constantinople and spectacular mosaic tile floor.  I also saw the greatest museum -- Peggy Guggenheims former home, which she donated to the city along with her private art collection.  The art was nice and the house was wonderful, facing right onto the Grand Canal at one of its most beautiful points.  I should end this voluminous letter now, if any of you are still with me!  Please forgive if it is entirely too detailed, but I am probably going to rely more heavily on my computer updates than on a handwritten journal for the rest of the trip.  Just skim it and read the highlights, if you like!  I leave for Vienna in two days and plan, in the meantime, to visit Verona one day and see more of Venice on the other.  Stay tuned for the Vienna/Istanbul update next!  Ciao!  Lisa

      Buon Giorno, All!  This is going to be a quick and dirty update for my time in Spain!  Let's just say its length will correspond proportionately to my Spanish speaking abilities!  So, when I left you last I had just arrived  in Madrid.  My train bunkmates on the way to Madrid included two Aussies, two Argentinians and one older man who we think was Spanish.  He traveled with a large box that took up nearly our whole compartment, a dolly to transport the box and another dolly he had not yet unwrapped.  He woke us all more than an hour before our train arrived in Madrid by clapping happily and singing a song of which the chorus was "Santa Maria."  No one in the compartment had heard this song before.  We suspect, however, that it was used to rouse his children each day, which explains his solo state of travel when we made his acquaintance.  Seriously, though, he seemed very nice and was actually quiet until he displayed his horrifying tendencies toward morning cheerfulness.  I must admit that Madrid was not my very favorite city I visited (and I feel very lucky not to have been there today when the 2 terrorist bombs went off).  On the bright side, I loved two of the big museums there, explored a bullfighter bar with my new Aussie friends, enjoyed playing photographer around the huge Parc Retiro, caught up on some shopping and had a FANTASTIC meal at Botin . . . thanks for the restaurant recommendation, David Radman!  I loved my meal even though my view throughout it included an entire leg of a cow (in the process of being shaved for inclusion in various dishes) and a man who was right out of The Godfather.  Also at Botin, I met some incredibly funny Brits who tried to take me out dancing.  They had the classic British dry sense of humor and made me laugh like crazy.  One of them manages a pub, the two brothers and their friend live in Gibraltar and run the power company there and the oldest one of the bunch (Ken) was a fighter pilot for Britain in World War II and described for me the ceremony in which he received a medal for his service from the Queen.  We were treated to traditional Spanish music by some university students who play at the restaurants for extra money.  The next day, I took a day trip to Toledo, a charming town built on hills with very twisted streets and medieval architecture.  In the station, I made friends with Maria, who made sure I found my train.  She teaches English to adults and is happy to have retired from teaching children of middle school age.  As if to reinforce this point, Maria and I encountered on the train a group of 10 and 11 year olds on their way home from a field trip to one of Madrid's museums.  Three of these boys (Angel, Ruben and Alberto) sat across from us.  According to Maria, they were very curious about me and conferred amongst themselves regarding how to start a conversation with me.  I took the bull by the horns (this being Spain, after all) and asked them in Spanish what their names were.  Next thing I knew, a flood of perfect English questions poured forth from the boys and their friends.  One little girl shouted out her address and invited me to stay with her and her parents.  I would love to see the looks on their faces if an American girl with a huge backpack showed up at their house!  I know that my photo of the boys and myself together will be one of my favorites from the trip!  Once I reached Toledo, I saw a gorgeous cathedral and even heard the organ play in it (these organs are as big as a whole room (and then some) in our typical house).  I was impressed by the dedication of a couple of Japanese guys who were wheeling around their father in his wheelchair on the steep and bumpy cobblestone streets.  The city was very beautiful and even the long walk back to the train station offered wonderful views of the surrounding area and skyline of the city.  I left Madrid after three days and headed to Granada, home of the Alhambra.  See this week's picture!  It was an amazing set of palaces on a hilltop with an incredible view of the Sierra Nevada.  Although the mountains were snow-covered, I was walking around without a jacket most of the time!  I also completed a very long hike up to a monastery above the Alhambra.  It was a whirlwind day, however, because I was catching a night train to Barcelona.  Barcelona is the city I would plan if I could design my own town . . . ocean, mountains, great architecture, interesting museums, wonderful food and cultural events and a very cool aquarium.  I stayed in a youth hostel that served beer from a vending machine . . . not something you often see in the States!  The hostel was very convenient, too, right on the Placa Reial and just a stone's throw from Las Ramblas, a length of street that people walk up and down.  It's crowded with florists, bird sellers, mimes, newsstands, hard to explain, but very social and fun.  I loved Antoni Gaudi's modernist buildings and the Picasso museum best of everything I saw.    Well, I need to run because I am attending a classical music concert this evening.  I am in Siena, Italy right now, which will be featured prominently in the next update!  Ciao!

      Hola, All!  I am writing from an internet cafe right off the Plaza del Sol in sunny Madrid, Spain.  I crossed the border into Spain late last night and arrived here early this morning, along with my new Australian friends Kieran and Richard.  I will tell you all about Spain in the next installment of my reports so that I can catch you up on my French adventures today!  When I last wrote you, I had just arrived in Tours.  I spent a great few days there -- the sun came out, considerably improving my mood, and Tours is a beautiful city with great museums.  One of my favorites was a wax museum that told the history of the Touraine region.  The figures were incredibly lifelike and it was very well done, taking you up and down through various levels of a castle until you felt like you might be wandering through a haunted house!  I took a bit of a church break in Tours, seeing only one (I usually average 3-4 church inspections per day).  I also took a morning trip out to Chenonceaux (the town) to see Chenonceau (the chateau).  The story of my trip there is not for the weak-hearted: it involved a stuck train door, a James Bond-like leap from a barely moving train, and a sore knee.  That said, it was worth it to see an amazing castle on such a gorgeous day and my knee is feeling much better now.  I was surprised at how cold castles are -- I guess that explains the clothing style of the former inhabitants!  But I think I could build a fire and find a way to make do, if forced to do so!  On the train from Tours to Poitiers, I met a woman who taught English in Poitiers for many years.  Much to my relief, she was eager to speak in English about her city and experiences, which included escorting school boys on field trips to the United States and Canada.  She almost made me feel  competent and level-headed as she described incidents including: (1) a passport search through 10,000 bags on a dock before a boy could board his ship; and (2) retrieving a passport from a desk drawer in the home of a host family that had left for vacation, with the help of the police, on the last night of the trip.  Her pride in her city turned out to be well-founded -- it is a very beautiful medieval town with windy streets filled with shops, lots of nice Christmas decorations and a truly great museum with exhibits nearly as wonderful as its architecture.  Also in Poitiers, I had my best glass of wine yet -- a regional white wine that I absolutely loved and will try to locate in the States!  Having learned my lesson about stressing too much over planning (or, more accurately, failed plans), I rolled the dice with an early morning train from Poitiers to Limoges, thinking I might visit a town called Cahors.  When the wait for the Cahors connection turned out to be pretty long, I decided to forego the Limoges train station wait (although I was truly enjoying the brisk 32 degree temperature and raging wind through the station) and hop a train to Rocamadour on the recommendation of the reservations guy.  I have attached a picture of Rocamadour so you can see why I will hug the reservations guy if I ever see him again -- but don´t look at it quite yet!  So, I arrived at the Rocamadour train station and started calling around for hotels, although I didn´t expect much because the place is fairly devoid of tourists at this time of year.  I was right -- nothing was open, so I reconciled myself to spending only the day there.  That´s when Jeanette, the train station attendant (who has worked for the railroad for 20 years) stepped in.  Jeanette called her friend Marguerite Larnaudie who runs a "chambre d´hote" in her house -- rooms for rent that include breakfast and an optional dinner cooked by Marguerite.  Next thing I knew, Marguerite´s husband, Pierre, picked me up in their car and I found myself in a wonderful home with my very own cozy room with my very own bathroom and shower and a feather bed and feather pillows!  (You will never take those things for granted again if you travel like I have traveled this week!)  I should mention that on the way home, Pierre stopped the car so I could take a good look at the city of Rocamadour: it literally took my breath away.  (You may look at the attached picture now).  Add to this picture that it was a rainy day so there was a nice mist hanging over the canyon, making the city appear like something in a dream.  I decided to spend the entire weekend with Marguerite and Pierre because the city was so gorgeous and their house so comfortable.  The story of Rocamadour is that hundreds of years ago, the residents found a perfectly preserved body on what is now the Notre Dame chapel there.  They decided it was Zaccheus, the tax collector from the Bible, and that it was a miracle that they found him in such a condition.  Accordingly, they built an entire religious city in his honor -- at the top of the hill is the castle with its ramparts, you walk down a very steep zigzag incline that has at each "zig" one of the 14 stations of the cross, then you reach the religious city that includes several chapels.  Below that is a "grand escalier" religious pilgrims have climbed on their knees that leads down to the village and several shops.  Beautiful!   It´s a good thing I got all that exercise climbing up and down the canyon because Marguerite served for dinner (to me and a French couple whose 11 year old son was away on his first ski vacation): red wine, bread and pate with foie gras (made from her own duck), confit de canard (a delicious dish made from her own duck), green beans, cheese (made locally) and crepes with jam made from peaches, oranges, pears (and kiwi, I think).  I slept well!  On Sunday, I attended a Catholic mass (there is no other kind of church in France, apparently!) that was all in French but still sounded awfully familiar.  I reluctantly left Rocamadour Monday morning for Toulouse, where I would later catch the train for Madrid.  Yesterday was therefore spent traveling and running various errands during my layovers in between trains.  En route to Madrid, I met lots of new people: a kind old man who offered me a cough drop on the train (he prescribed his own cough medicine, a miniature bottle of wine that he sipped from periodically), two French guys named Pierre and Ian who attend graduate school in Spain and will become Spanish professors this year, two American girls studying in Madrid for the semester and the aforementioned Kieran and Richard.  Well, I must go enjoy the day, which I believe will include a visit to the Prado museum and a stroll through Madrid´s botanical gardens.  Tonight the Aussies and I will engage in the traditional Madrid "tapas tour" which involves hopping from place to place to try different Spanish appetizers.  Sorry this update is so long, but it was an eventful week!  I hope your week is great and thanks again to all for the e-mails!  Adios, Lisa

      Bonjour, All!  I am sitting in the hottest copy shop in all of France -- hot meaning warm, not cool.  The trip is going well so far!  I figured out what I forgot (those who saw me pack will wonder how that could have happened) the moment I stepped off the plane -- gloves, my Neiman's mints and mailing addresses so I could send post cards!  Please send me your mailing address, anyone who would like a card!  So far, I have been to the following French cities:  Paris (shopped in the Jewish neighborhood and rode in a sardine-like packed mètro that reminded me about certain cultural differences)  Ambroise (saw a cute group of French schoolkids embarking on a field trip, the chateau where Henry II, who was 4 feet tall, bumped his head on a low -- how low could it have been?!?-- doorway on the way to a tennis match and died, and a chocolate shop in business since 1913 -- for good reason!)  Fontreveaud (visited an enormous Abbey, which happens to house the "remains" of Richard the Lion-Hearted and would make a great setting for a horror movie -- my favorite place so far)  Saumur (more on that later)  and Tours (I am here now and for the next day or two, met my first English-speakers -- an Australian and a girl from Denton, Texas -- in 3 days here and will use it as a base to visit Chateau Chenonceau tomorrow).  My French-speaking capabilities have ranged from decent to embarrassingly awful, but I am already starting to think in French sometimes!  As you would expect, some people are incredibly nice and some are not.  To those of you who said you were envious of this trip, this description of my day yesterday should cure you (STOP reading now if you don't want to be disillusioned!): awoke at 7am to catch train, walked to station with  40-pound pack, picking up croissant and Coke breakfast, rode to Tours,  I planned to leave pack at the station for the day, learned thanks to the terrorists most stations won't store packs anymore, rode train to Saumure after comical half-French, half-English exchange with Information about location of the proper rail line, in Saumur walked to youth hostel with very heavy pack because line was busy when I called for a reservation, found hostel closed for 2 weeks (Let's Go book apparently missed that one!).  Sat down, thought about revenge on Let's Go, contemplated asking garbage truck drivers who came to this isolated place for ride back to station.  Help arrived in the form of a sweet (and cute) special edu! cation teacher with a van of his students -- he told me not to be afraid -- I wasn't -- and gave me a lift back to the station.  Begged Saumur information desk people to hold pack while I visited the Abbey.  In Fontevraud, misread French bus schedule and feared I would not get back to Saumur before info desk closed for night.  Found timely bus, retrieved pack, rode train to Tours and splurged on cab ride to youth hostel, where I had made a reservation and they were actually open.  Tried to find internet source last night, got bad info from hotel hosts, met kind Chinese/French girl who led me on internet hunt, then to dinner.  I never realized how much work it is to make all plans and do all navigating on your own! Last night, I raised a glass in toast to Amy Krasner (my partner in crime on my last trip here) -- she made that trip infinitely easier!  Even this computer keyboard is a challenge -- it must be arranged to accomodate keys commonly used in French.  All in all, however, I am very glad to be here and am learning a lot, not just about France.  I should grab some lunch (it's 7 hours earlier here than in Illinois and Texas).  Have a great day and talk to you again soon!  Lisa  P.S.  Thanks to those who sent e-mails already -- it's nice to read friendly messages from home!
