       Today was the first day of getting a flavour of the "shapeless" beast called community. Went about discussing the launch of new SIG within another user group. this is far from the exact equations of science. this is purely understanding the person in the front and get into his pants. needs a lot of patience and more so a lot of understanding. i am just getting at it!!! some excellent posts on how to carry the user groups forward i found on : www.ineta.org  there is something interesting as well. linux costs more than windows... challenged??? take a look here: www.microsoft.com/mscorp/facts/default.asp i have always believed in this.. here is the proof that it actually made sense.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This posting is provided "AS IS" with no warranties, and confers no rights.

       Well, today i got "active" enough to post the kodaikanal photos on web. they are available at : http://photos.yahoo.com/abhishekkant  Kodaikanal is a hill station in south India. yes my friend there are other mountains in India apart from the Himalayas...   took a bus from chennai and made an overnight journey to the "land of clouds" - well this is term i coined. The day we arrived walked up to coaker's walk..   just hung around a little and wasted time.. The funny thing is it was not as cold as we expected.. by evening it rained and finally kodai was a hill station.. The next day we went upto pillar rocks purely on foot..   yes sir, a total of 14 kms of walking... the best was yet to come.. The boating.. as with anything it started with a thud when we took the paddle boat.. The beauty of the thing came out when we started on a rowing boat.. and with it came the rain.. we got wet and kept rowing.. now if u have never done that before u should definitely try that... i wish i could row more.. i will someday..  now things at Bangalore have started to pick up.. i am afraid though that i might loose touch with technology if i ONLY remain in touch with people and not technology.. so here it goes.. i will also be involved in development of shared software.. i know of sourceforge.net.. will check that out and volunteer...  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This posting is provided "AS IS" with no warranties, and confers no rights.

       This is my first blog ever.  As I see it, this is a new year, new city (Bangalore, India), new job and great new opportunity to start learning all over again. This represents shift in my world as i start to move away from programming towards interacting with people. More value there defintely, as I firmly believe in the power of like minded people contributing to the same cause.  The start from being an island to being the channel that feeds to the river of knowledge. You'll see more of me now.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------- This posting is provided "AS IS" with no warranties, and confers no rights.

       Today was Valentine's Day.. or so people said :)  Today was the day i rediscovered my love.. my love for Flight Simulator that had borne the brunt of other personal hurricanes in my life. now that may sound uncool.. very boring... but people for lack of anything better rediscovering your love for something or someone is cool on Valentine's day..  guess that makes me a complete geek.. the process had started 2.5 years ago when i decided to join a computer firm instead of a bank that the whole of my campus seemed to be obsessed about.   i played the cessna 172 flying lessons for half of the day and was rewarded by a student pilot licence by the end of the day.. now that is something i can feel good about.. if nothing else.. and to quote another stag friend of mine "spending time with a woman the whole day, you wouldn't be talking about anything accomplished by the end of the day"  the valentine reminds me of a chapter in my life that was closed some years ago.. valentine's was the day when the flame had died out and had left me more experienced and more practical..  and in the night i fly to china.. china - a superpower, the dragon who looks the elephant in the eye.. china of today, SARS.. BIRD FLU... the beehive of diseases now plaguing the world.. i don't know whether the dragon will blow the fire on me and extinguish the life i take for granted. nevertheless i look forward to the trip of the land behind the iron curtain.. i have a list of things i think of buying from there: 1. DV cable for my digicam - will it work with the firewire port that my laptop proudly possesses 2. A cool backpack - don't they make all that stuff in china? 3. A cool pair of shades - don't all the chinese looking guys in the action movies seem to be wearing them? the preparation for the trip was the chat on yahoo with someone in china room.. the golden piece of advice i got from there was - "Keep some cash on hand".. and that scared me.. 'cause when i board my flight today i will have no foriegn currency in hand.. a stark departure to the TC i would carry in my earlier trips while being in satyam.. another piece of advice was to carry some 200 of chinese currency per day for expenditure except the hotel and captain, that is what i intend to carry... 1400 of chinese currency for 7 days :)  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This posting is provided "AS IS" with no warranties, and confers no rights.

       Funny!!! I am blogging about why blogging is not for me...  The list follows: 1. I have to be connected to the internet for the same. - Most of the times i am without a computer leave aside internet connection. 2. My friends don't blog.. and if i start talking about blog they look as if i am talking greek. 3. Blogging takes too much time.. in case ur interested in one's online personality, blogging is for you... otherwise if u r touchy feely ... nah  nah.. I DON'T have time to blog.. 4. I feel like a preacher when i am blogging - I am not a preacher 5. I can't disclose my innnermost feelings on internet - I am shy!!! 6. I have nothing to talk about - not really but to invisible audience it is.. 7. I never maintained diaries growing up.. why should i now? 8. I feel naked while blogging..  9. I vent out any emotion i feel in person.. there is nothing unsaid that i can write here.. no hidden thoughts.. - I am direct.. 10. Frankly, given an option between blogging and outdoor activities, I would choose the latter..   So why i am blogging... 'cause it gets indexed by google real fast :)  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This posting is provided "AS IS" with no warranties, and confers no rights.

       Thanks to  urlLink Sudhakar , this is probably the first time I am reading in public the importance Product groups within MS see for the great individuals that MVPs are!!   Of course, I have "heard" numerous times about people talking about how great the MVP program really is.. but this is one documented musing :) At the MVP Summit, the Product Groups jostled for attention of MVPs and that is a fact important enough to realise the importance of "community" thinking in the products MS is developing going forward.  No application in the world has tighter community integration than the one i have seen with MS Office 2003.    The community is at the guts of a "commercial" product..  And if you have been following  urlLink Bill's speech at CEO Summit , you would know about the community and blogs he talked about..  Now if only you were wondering why Product Groups are standing up and taking notice :) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This posting is provided "AS IS" with no warranties, and confers no rights.

       So you wanted to be a techie from IIT? the JEE bowled you out?? take heart - only one in hundred applicants make it to IIT (which is tougher than getting into Ivy League colleges) author of the book "Five Point Someone", Chetan Bhagat (an ex-IITian) says. When i was planning to do my MBA, i read the book "Snapshots from hell" authored by Robinson that gave a insight into Stanford Business School..  Now, we have our own IIT version of the pains and gains one goes through that makes them go from good to great.. The book captures the 5 point GPA (out of 10) travails that a few IITians went through..  the interesting stuff (like the omnipresent playboy) in the IIT hostels are making the book an interesting read :) so things are not that "academic" behind the closed doors ;-) i am still reading the book, it was soo interesting that i couldn't resist writing about it.. and chetan is going to be in bangalore on May 22nd (more details at the URL mentioned above) to sign a few copies.. i am going to be there.. we need more literature like this to document the great institutions that we have in india. as an afterthought, would it be a good idea to publish the book in hindi?? ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This posting is provided "AS IS" with no warranties, and confers no rights.

       Thanks to  urlLink Tejas , Took a blogger personality test  urlLink here . The result: My  urlLink Bloginality  is  urlLink INTP !!!  So what does it mean as a blogger?  As a weblogger, you might not be as concerned about popularity, but more with the ideas and theories that you strive to understand. Because routines aren't your strong point, you might be more likely to work on the concept of how to do a blog, but not be as excited to keep it up.   The next cool thing i did: Added Microsoft Alert from Scoble's blog.. wonder if there is a service out there that just provides people the ability to provide MSN alerts to others who want to subscribe to their blogs??      ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This posting is provided "AS IS" with no warranties, and confers no rights.

       GMAIL: 1 GB YAHOO: 100 MB  Confession: I have a Gmail account.. the 1 GB utopia that is unleashing a new kind of frenzy on the internet..   Though Yahoo has made public announcements on the 100 MB space my yahoo account is still the old 6 MB. Yahoo plans to implement the 100 MB space only in the summer!  Here are some of the interesting things that I thought make sense:  1. On  urlLink CNET.com  I read an article that said - GMail will be reading all the email that flows in and out of the GMail mailboxes. On further investigation from the GMail help pages, here is what I gathered - "No humans will read the content of your email in order to target such advertisements or related information."  This is talking about a technology called Ad-Sense that makes it possible for advertisers to target specific email campaigns based on the text of emails that a person sends or receives. Also, through the magic of "Family-Safe" ads, only safe ads will be sent out to the consumers. Ad-Sense and Family Sense technologies being a Black Box, I really don't know what is happening inside. I personally don't have a problem with machines reading my email till I am not spammed against my wishes. The privacy policies of GMail seem good and promise not to sell any PII.  2. "Privacy International" is going after the GMail. Looks like GMail is now BIG enough to warrant attention and law suits :) After all, it is only big fish that yields meat... California State Senator  urlLink http://www.internetnews.com/bus-news/article.php/3339451">Liz Figueroa  author of "Do-Not-Call legislation" is also  in fray to "warn" people of the dangers of GMail. My concern is that lawyers force technology companies to become more of a lawyer firm than a technology firm that it started with. Google might one day find a law suit so big on their chest that it will decide to throw out the "rotten apple" from its basket.  3. Till today, no email service has proved to be economically justifiable. Hotmail, Yahoo or any other.. Email is something that is retained to keep the consumers coming to their e-commerce portals even if the company is loosing money in hoards... So the rule should be, lesser the space, lower the losses. IF GMail is to sustain the 1 GB limit, I really think that they have to come up with something more justifiable, something that looks like a business model...  4. Is GMail a pre-IPO gimmick to get people excited on google? Given that GMail is tom-tomming about the BETA aspect, when it goes lives the promised space would be missing due to "sustainability" issues.  5. MOST IMPORTANTLY, what happens to my other email accounts that all my friends and family know? It is unlike the Cell Phone no. that can remain constant even when one switches operators...  If I get a GMail account today (till the IPO is hugely over subscribed and Google gets the money), my friends might find a return mail in their mailboxes if they write to me @gmail.com post the IPO.  The two features that I find cool about GMail: - Google search to look up information in my mailbox. Currently, there is NO better search technology than Google. It remains to be seen though how dedicated that technology will be to the GMail mailboxes. - Preview feature of GMail that is not available in Web Based emails. Though, my favourite MS Office Outlook does give me that feature!!!  The fact remains that GMail AMAZES me.... both from the mind blogging space if offers and the business model they are going after (that might be a trade secret)...  Till the dust settles... I am not swimming with the sharks....  P.S.: I am making this post using the new email based blogging support recently introduced.

       Microsoft will be discontinuing the wi-fi hardware that it has under its wings.. Microsoft had a complete line of Wi-Fi products including base stations, laptop cards, and USB and PCI add-ons for desktop machines.   i am myself an owner of a base station! what happens if i need support? well, the 2 year support stays with the product.. the product will be available for some more time in the stores..   someone told me that it is illegal to possess a 802.11g wireless device in India.. :(  does this reflect a broader range of changes wherein MS exits most of the businesses that are not core to its functioning.. like hardware.. does this mean no more MS mouse or keyboard? or is there a partnership in sight?  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This posting is provided "AS IS" with no warranties, and confers no rights.

       Day after day, one thing that bothers me is why isn't there a IT professionals community. i can think of various answers, not knowing the correct one: 1. IT Pros are trained to be sceptical and paranoid. they are told not to trust users asking for more rights to their desktops - look for any suspicious activity :)  2. they are too busy with their work to think about anything else. 3. Sharing to them means letting out company secret. after all they hold the secret of any organisations infrastructure architecture - the first thing a black hat wants to know. 4. In India, we don't have sense of community to start with.  probably the reasons are at a psychological level and totally baseless too... but u know the critical mind..  what can we do to improve the situation?  1. Get a public community website? Available at: http://www.microsoft.com/technet/community/default.mspx Has interesting sections like: 1. Most Active IT Pro Newsgroups 2. Most Active IT Pro Discussions 3. IT Pro KB Articles 4. Top IT Pro Downloads 5. Links to webcasts, webchats, seminars etc.  2. Have a community user group locally IT Pro Special Interest Groups (SIGs) were launched in variuos user groups around the country in the past 3 months or so... some useful links to see if you are in India and are an IT Pro:  urlLink Bangalore User Group   urlLink Chennai User Group   urlLink Mumbai User Group   urlLink Hyderabad User Group   urlLink Siliguri's Windows Support User Group   urlLink Coimbatore IT User Group   urlLink Delhi IT Pro User Group   and there is an umbrella group for all IT Pro user groups in the world: www.culminis.org And they are offering annual membership fee waived if you join before July 1st, 2004. i really like their membership criteria of at least 12 months of operation as an official organization and 50 or more registered members.. additionally, they have thought of membership level on the size of the user group... the question that i would like to put is - Does the number matter or it is no. of active members? i have my reservations on the benefits that a US based organisation can provide in India. Do we need an Indian chapter of the same? Any takers here?  3. we even have a cool logo for the IT Pro Community in India:     Now if someone can throw in a cool suggestion to heat up the scene..  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This posting is provided "AS IS" with no warranties, and confers no rights.

       RSS feed for this blog is available now at: http://feeds.feedburner.com/WhenTechnologyIsOnlyAPartOfTheWhole  The service is provided by  urlLink Feedburner . The above URLs make sense to people who would like to consume my blog's feed as RSS rather than Atom (myself included)..  RSS Syndication was on my mind for long. Tejas had created a RSS service for me and sent me a mail on how i can enable the RSS feed for my blog. He had proposed a service from  urlLink Feedster.com .  I browsed through the offerings from both services. The one service that Feedburner has is it's ability to provide statistics of people subscribing to my feed. This was missing in feedster.  There were no modifications required on the blog's template for feedburner unlike feedster. Finally, feedburner is supporting all the RSS versions while feedster supports only RSS 2.0.  So, I am settling for  urlLink Feedburner  as it was offering more services than feedster.  I remember where it all started from -  urlLink Tejas . ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This posting is provided "AS IS" with no warranties, and confers no rights.

       I had a very interesting chat today with one of the most important people - one MVP on the direction of the MVP Program in India. I reproduce in a "scrubbed" manner some of the intersting things we discussed:  1) Nomination Forms in Infopath ... ? how will that work. in India hardly anyone has InfoPath ... or you are expecting someone will download the demo to file his nomination ? you can create a ASP.NET webform that can utilize the same backend ... for ppl who want to submit it online..  My answer: there is a SP1 that is available for download for free on infopath. people can download the same. it is a fully functional standalone download of 135MB :) (functional till July when it expires). that means that even if you don't have Office installed on your machine, Infopath would install without any hitch. infopath is meant for scenarios like filling forms etc and hence it makes sense to convert our forms to infopath. later in time we will directly connect the form to the backend and nominations would be automated..  infopath is a rich client for filling out form based information and i like rich clients for the ease of use and amazing in-built functionality..   2) see most of the guys are on a crunch internet connection .... downloading something large is just too much pain !! you need to look at the usablity part for a country like India ... downloading InfoPath to fill 1 form .. will be too much..  My answer: i agree with you on the bandwidth issues.... we are not looking at "people".. we are looking at MVPs... and the form goes out to around 20 in a quarter.. we actually plan to ship Eval copies to people who don't have Infopath. rather ones who can't download the same.. to those select prospective 20 MVPs in a quarter.   Addendum: it would do both ... let you use infopath ... and let the evals sent to ppl who could test the functionality of this new tool   3) isn't that to nominate NEW MVP's ? or its a renomination of existing MVP's ??  My answer: For both. New MVPs as well as for re-nomination. for old MVPs, they already have MSDN subscriptions and hence should not face any problem.  4) "Another feature this time is that the nomination will be concentrating on more experienced people who have made the Indian Programming landscape noticeable in the world." - can you throw some more light on this ? i am really interested to find out where this whole program is going ...   My answer: you would see more diversified set of people coming in now. people with experience and community drive... on more experienced people, we mean people whom industry respects.. the community activities remaining the MAIN focus.. that is where this thing is headed.. internally people have to associate MVP program to experienced industry people.. and externally, the voice of MVPs need to be heard at quarters where it is not heard currently..  Addendum: people will realise the voices of MVP's are  stronger ... its already started in Redmond ... i have been interacting with a lot of PM's etc ... and they respond back .. quite nicely .... since they have realised the power of the MVP Program.. the situation is only different in India ... where, most MS guys we interact with ... are no dev people but from support teams (PSS).. hence .. they only know / hear a few WELL KNOWN people ...    5) the last thing i want to happen in this program is that MVP's start to feel neglected ... since they will never get heard.. only the powerful few will get heard. .. you yourself said that experienced people will get the program more accepted and ppl will hear ... and we know ppl will hear them .... and only them .. .. which may or may not be the view of all MVP's !! people don't treat everyone the same ... its not just Human.  My Response: don't worry about the "powerful" part.. an MVP is an MVP is an MVP.. there is no tiering within MVPs.. i said that important people in industry will hear from the experienced people.. within the program, all are same...  in community, powerful is not one who is experienced but one whose ideas are respected and honoured.. these guys are leaders by virtue of their thought leadership and anyone who generates them is powerful and experienced.. don't you want urself recognised at every location that you go to... without having to explain what is MVP ?  6) very famous people like Richard Grimes, Scoble (was) were MVP's.. and many more on the IT Pro side too.. when someone says MVP .. there are Offices which say .. WHO MVP's? so my point is ... big names being a part of the MVP Program does NOT essentially make the program famous.. my personal thoughts are .. that even if well known personalities join the program.. the program will not get as much attention..  My answer: Current MVPs are the eyes and ears of the program.. if you know some prospective MVP please let me know... the work that one does should automatically get one noticed and respected.. if we are facing that problem in india it means 2 things: a. people are blind to contributions b. we are not contributing enough or contributing correctly  i would tend to take the latter opinion as we really can't do much with the former :) well known personalities are there, as they have done something good and worthwhile.. they have reputation 'cause people have seen value in them and their contributions.. they are leaders by virtue of people who believe in them..  if they are there to work with MVPs everyone gets benefitted..  7) i think in the Goa meet we should come up with activites that MVP's can do to make ourselves famous.. discuss community activites like Projects, Books etc ... that makes the program famous ... and one good project .. or book.. and everyone knows about it   My Response: That's why we are meeting.. more at the "India Advocates Day" in Goa..   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This posting is provided "AS IS" with no warranties, and confers no rights.

       MVP Nominations are now open. We will be nominating people who have contributed to the community in an exemplary way for the past year. The nomination will remain open for the week of May 10th to May 15th.  This year we are using Infopath SP1 Form to invite nominations. The same will be available on the website starting Monday. The learning curve for Infopath form development is steep in the beginning. once you get a hang of it, things move really quick. Another feature this time is that the nomination will be concentrating on more experienced people who have made the Indian Programming landscape noticable in the world. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This posting is provided "AS IS" with no warranties, and confers no rights.

       'cause i couldn't add it to the comments...  -------  thanks  urlLink Tejas  for taking time to break the myths.. i think this is what people need to know when they start a blog..  for all the reasons i wrote, it was prefixed by a statement - "Funny!!! I am blogging about why blogging is not for me..." 'cause truly i am beginning to see the value of blogging..   the VERY fact that people are shy of talking about their affairs, their sex stories, their night mares leads me to believe that the butterfly is yet to emerge out of the cocoon.. it is probably simple to write about the things that are neutral and impersonal.. that is something that i wanted to steer clear of..   buddy, there is a set of people called "geekswithblogs" and there is another called "idontknowblogs"..  i am sure i would make friends with blog community now that i am here...   i agree with blogging being a dialogue than a diary but u see i never wrote what i felt.. it is new to me..  my comment to online connectivity was related to the fact that u can have good conversation when u r regularly connected.. i have a mental block right now.. and that is i only blog (read comments and trackback and blogrolling too) when i am connected to internet.. somehow it is reverts to writing a diary if you are using offline tools..  and given i really don't know about the personality of the invisible audience, i don't know what to talk about.. my latest blog entry is on my new haircut.. i don't know if online audience like to hear about it.. but boy that is the first thing people have been talking about when they meet me.. my landlord had difficulty recognising me in the morning today :)  cutting the comments short, those were my ideas some time ago.. as my experience with blogging grows and i get interesting conversation like yours going i am sure one day i will blog on - "Why blogging is my daily chore?"  Thanks again guys for taking out time to fix these notions of mine :)  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This posting is provided "AS IS" with no warranties, and confers no rights.

       wanted to check if blogger supports images... had seen images being displayed by buzznet.com photo blog... so was sure that there was a way to get the pictures in...  for starters, i loaded the image (440 KB) to my FREE hosting site that i once had... well 440KB, shattered the whole space...  needed to reduce the size of the file... used "Microsoft Office Photo Manager" to reduce the size of the file to 45KB... neat!!! i first tried this link- "img src="www25.brinkster.com/abhishekkant/DCP_0088.JPG" This didn't work.. the solution was that i needed to attach "http://" in the src of the image... reached that conclusion, once i used frontpage to insert the same image and noticed the "http" part... so here is the first photo posted on the blog... the bright flowers to light up your day...     Wild flowers in Seattle, somewhere ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This posting is provided "AS IS" with no warranties, and confers no rights.

       now that i have been bought into blogging, i wonder what is a better way to blog.. text or photos?  the other day i was authoring an event newsletter. i wrote volumes of material. looked at it and then deleted the whole thing. replaced the whole thing with 5 photographs and captioned it "because a picture is a thousand words"..  probably people take a glance at the photographs and get drawn to the email.  text based newsletter, i would not look at.. if it was not a life saver... buzznet is one photo blog that i have subscribed to. both are cross linked. let's see what people find more interesting.. the text or the photo..  to end the debate, probably the answer would be a balance of the two... but if u have to keep the debate going..... ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This posting is provided "AS IS" with no warranties, and confers no rights.

       With Longhorn taking stage at most of the events (read DevDays), there was an interesting topic on WSE vs Indigo. Should people keep looking at WSE 1.0 and 2.0 and 3.0 and ..... or wait for Indigo architecture? Here is a great resource to tackle that question. http://msdn.microsoft.com/theshow/episode040/default.asp It's a John Shewchuk show on the .NET show talking about Indigo: when it started, what the roadmap is, why/how the relationship with IBM and also how WSE gradually will 'evolve' into Indigo.

       Loyalty is not a new concept. it is old to any organisation that dares to look beyond the product it provides. an organisation thinking about the loyalty has taken the leap from inner facing management to a culture that is outward facing. apparantly there is nothing in short time that an organisation gains from loyalty programs, probably some RED figures on the P&L, red faced boss.......   urlLink MSDN Connection  is a one such loyalty program from Microsoft. If you are a developer and have been to various MS sessions (official or community activities) you would know that each time you register with your entire details. Did u ever wonder where does all that information landing up?  MSDN Connections seeks to set correct this redundancy.. the personal information resides in a US privacy law compliant database (read passport).. the other event specific details remain on local databases and provide the local flexibility that is soo important for local action.  But is this all MSDN Connection is about? What was that rant about loyalty? MSDN Connection is primarily a program that strives to engage developers in a engaging "conversation". Loud statement, eh? The conversation is about talking your language in your terms. So if you are a SQL enthusiast, we would not put ASP.NET Whidbey Community Preview DVD in your mailbox..   The real value unleashes in time when people who are enthusiasts for MS Technologies deepen their relationship with Microsoft and move into higher tiers of MSDN Connection program. they get priority seating, get to see some cool technology stuff (yet to be unveiled) and get other exclusive benefits!! Now this is fun!!!  In India, there was a staggered launch with DevDays 2004 at Mumbai and Bangalore on 3rd and 5th May. People had an opportunity to register through the online terminals that were made available. And we gave away some pretty cool badge slings.. :)  The MSDN Connection program continues to evolve as we re-discover the passion of the Indian Developer and give him his dish served in his own style.  This blog entry is dedicated to Anand who took some personal time off to explain to me what to blog every day. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This posting is provided "AS IS" with no warranties, and confers no rights.

       my holidays are coming to an end. holidays that are entirely spent at home.. i kept the resolution of not touching my computer during the entire holiday.. last but one day i have broken it.. taking some time to check out some of the mailboxes that are getting flooded.. the respite is i have not still checked my official mailbox..  i will be back in bangalore late night on June 27th.. joining office on June 28th.. the holiday was a relieving break and i am already feeling revitalised :) So what all did i do in vacations? 1. Went to Hoshiarpur, Punjab where my parents stay 2. Ate and Slept (pure luxury) and the loop kept repeating 3. Caught with few family friends 4. Enjoyed a 10 hour drive (one way) from Delhi and back with good roads and drive through the fields of Punjab 5. Had a severe stomach ache but still kept on gorging on food 6. Saw "Main Hoon Na" in the nice little home theatre at home 7. Played with children in the house 8. Went shopping with mom and sisters in the little markets of Hoshiarpur with Surdi shopkeepers.. was surprised at the number of "Western Union" money transfer outlets.. thanks to the numerous punjabis working abroad 9. Went out on Mom's birthday on 23rd and had great Dinner at Shiraz (one of the good hotels in Hoshiarpur)  i should put holidays in my calendar at a regular interval.. i think that will keep me GOING... ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This posting is provided "AS IS" with no warranties, and confers no rights.

       Installed XP SP2 RC2 today!  The install took more than an hour to download and install.. It went perfectly smooth.  On to exploring the features of the service pack 2 RC2.. Here is an  urlLink article  that talks about the feature changes in XP SP2 RC2...  A word of caution: XP SP2 RC2 will not be installed on the pirated copies of Windows XP. The official response - "SP2 will check the OS' product ID [PID] against a list of known pirated PIDs. If a PID is found to be invalid, SP2 will not install"  The SP2 RTM is probably coming out in July/ August..

       Well this is one thing that deserves its own entry. Bob McDowell at the induction impressed it well that this is one piece of article that is a MUST read.. we are talking about an article "IT Doesn't Matter" from Nicholas G. Carr published by Harvard Business Review. Looks like everybody who is anybody in the corporate world has read this. I need to read this as well. There are excerpts available on the internet. There is feedback on the article available at:  urlLink http://harvardbusinessonline.hbsp.harvard.edu/b02/en/files/misc/Web_Letters.pdf   Will add comments of mine once i am done reading the same.

       It has BEGUN!!  the speculation that Yahoo will be upgrading accounts to 100 MB is true.. out of 3 yahoo accounts i have, 2 have got upgraded to 100 MB.. Yahoo Mail also has a new interface :)  Let's see what happens with MSN now.. MSN has been maintaining that 2 MB is all that is going to be there for Hotmail as a free service.. can they still maintain that?

       My first event blogging ..  we arrived in afternoon around 1400 hrs (PST) and checked into the hotel - Residence Inn. On the plane, I had met Ashwini who was travelling on the same flight from Amesterdam. Laurent, a French guy from South of France was another MS101 attendee that i met while stil on the plane. Overlooking my window, i see "Hobby USA".. a place where i definitely want to be before i leave US.  the good thing about the hotel is - Internet is FREE.. and the first thing i do when i arrive is connect my laptop to the internet..  the room is cosy complete with sofa and kitchenette.. i dream of having such a room for myself.. surfed a little and thought of taking a nap.. the 18 hrs of flight time began to take its toll.. i sleep around 4 hoping to be awake by 6 after which we could go to the nearest "hot" spot.. (i leave it to you to decide on the "hot spot" part)..  9:30.. the red numbers on the watch read... i am now awake and the chances of even getting dinner are slim... called Ashwini and we both run out of hotel for dinner.. Only Matt's Rotiserrie at the Redmond City Center is open for dinner now (Source: Conceirge, Residence Inn)..  so we walk it up and i get to eat Nachos.. i can only eat half of it, courtesy the American portion size..  and then zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

       The cool new community tools being rolled out:  1. A new Web-based newsreader that will make perusing newsgroups easier.   2. "Smart components," which are dynamic Web-page elements that Microsoft plans to expose across the Microsoft.com community sites. (Examples of these components: a list of the 10 top downloads; the hottest newsgroup discussions; transcripts of the five most popular online chats.) Microsoft plans to make available to developers, customers and other interested parties these components in the form of RSS feeds. This feature will go live in late June.  3. A new "Chat 2.0" client that will allow users to participate in Microsoft online chats from inside their own corporate firewalls using port 80. This will be availale later this year.  4. Feedback sites from community for MS products like Longhorn, Windows Server etc.  If you have some more cool ideas about the community tools, feel free to post it as a comment. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This posting is provided "AS IS" with no warranties, and confers no rights.

       Starting June 1 2004, changes have been announced to the support policy for various products.   In the new support policy, the support for most software (business and developer products) has been extended minimally to 10 years (5 years mainstream and 5 years extended) from 7 years (5 years mainstream and 2 years extended). However, support for consumer, hardware and multimedia products stay at 5 years. Mainstream products (e.g. Money, Encarta, Picture It) released annually are only supported for 3 years.  Mainstream support includes all support including security updates and request for hotfixes. In the extended support phase, only paid support is available and no warranties are entertained.  Self help support and Security updates are available by using KB articles and other resources throughout the mainstream and extended support timelines.    For the newly available Service Packs, an older version is supported for 12 months (24 in special cases) with extended support automatically coming into play once a newer service pack is available. All service pack support ends whenever the product support is over.  To study a case, if you bought Windows 2000 Professional (released 31-Mar-2000)   2 years after its release (i.e. around 31 Mar 2002), you will be getting mainstream support for next 3 years till 30-Jun-2005. Post Jun 2005, you can request for paid support till 30-Jun-2010. Of course, the self help support is available throughout.  For the service packs the latest being SP4,  if you are still at SP1 (released 31-Jul-2000), the support ended 01-Aug-2002 if you are on SP2 (released 16-May-2001), the support will soon end on 30-Jun-2004 if you are on SP3 (released 01-Aug-2002), the support will end on 30-Jun-2005  if you are on SP4 (released 26-Jun-2003), the outer limit for support is 30 Jun 2010. the same will be revised if SP5 is released. Lesson: Stay with the current Service Pack to benefit from the support policieis. Microsoft may extended the support beyond the given timelines as well.  So what does this mean? It may mean that Microsoft is waking up to a reality that customers might be wanting less frequent releases of the products. Delay in Longhorn and other products may already be an indication on the delay that is now a business need *from customers* rather than development and project delays. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This posting is provided "AS IS" with no warranties, and confers no rights.

       Microsoft has been tilting towards getting more feedback from people recently.. this is visible from the fact that now we have "Community Preview" editions apart from RTM, RTW, IDW, Alpha, Beta etc.  At various opportunities, people talk to me about bright ideas they have about a particular MS product. I could listen to them and forget in sometime if there is no interest from others! Not to say that the idea was bad but that the idea gets drowned in the noise that is ever present.. Now, people can contribute their ideas on various MS products whenever they want. So if you thought that your idea was never heard or was lost in the noise, submit your wish to Microsoft directly at: http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;en-us;feedback  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This posting is provided "AS IS" with no warranties, and confers no rights.

       Tim Rains, PSS Security Team has developed a tool called Port Reporter that logs TCP and UDP port activity on Windows Systems. In his own words, this is the way that Port Reporter works: "When your system binds a new UDP port or accepts connections on a TCP port, it logs this activity in a text file.  It runs as a service on Windows Server 2003, Windows XP, Windows 2000, and Windows NT 4.0.  On our newer OSes (W2K3 and XP), this service logs what process is using each port, if the process is running as a service, and what modules (.dll, .drv, etc) the process has loaded.  This information will help you determine if your system has been sending suspicious outbound packets or accepting traffic that you were unaware of." You can download the same from: http://support.microsoft.com/?id=837243 or        ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This posting is provided "AS IS" with no warranties, and confers no rights.

       One of  urlLink Indian MVPs  sent me a mail on perspective of MVP nominations in countries outside India.   Please find the post  urlLink here .  One of the MVP Leads comments about the question that people don't ask but always wonder: > I keep getting the feeling that something is expected of MVPs that we aren't being told about.  "You were awarded based on your contributions over the past year. You don't have to do anything at all as far as program expectations go. Of course, if you want to get awarded the following year, you'll need to continue to contribute at a high level. We do provide you with as many opportunities (beta programs, conferences, and so forth) as we can, but you don't have to take us up on any of them. The only expectations that I, as the MVP Lead, have is that you conduct yourself in a professional manner. If you start slamming Microsoft or other MVPs, we'll have a conversation. That almost never happens in my happy little world. :-)"  If you want to know who is this MVP Lead and you are an MVP yourself (if you are not then you can't access the private newsgroup), please refer to the private newsgroups, announcements_discussions and post of Bev Howard on 12 May. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This posting is provided "AS IS" with no warranties, and confers no rights.

       The Threat Modeling Tool allows users to create threat model documents for applications. It organizes relevant data points, such as entry points, assets, trust levels, data flow diagrams, threats, threat trees, and vulnerabilities into an easy-to-use tree-based view. The tool saves the document as XML, and will export to HTML and MHT using the included XSLTs, or a custom transform supplied by the user.  http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=62830f95-0e61-4f87-88a6-e7c663444ac1&displaylang=en  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This posting is provided "AS IS" with no warranties, and confers no rights.

       Unique things we did (if anyone can find a repeat anywhere.. i will be compelled to take him/her out for a dinner :)  1. Hardware Pool: We got a hardware pool constituted of a Tablet PC, an XDA and 2 XBoxs. Created to bridge the gap between what is not available and what should be available.  2. MS Executive in attendance for 2 whole days: Shu Fen Cally Ko, Regional Director agreed to be with us at the event (even when it was a weekend) for the whole 2 days. She goes forward to the next country, Korea from here rather than Taiwan where she is based.  3. MS India Insider: Jas Gulati agreed to come over on a weekend to be with us. He has never worked with MVPs before, but the faith that they are *exceptional* got him here.  4. 3rd Party Perspective made available: It is always better to get a ringside view of things. Prof. Sadagopan, Director, IIIT graced the occasion with his presence to deliver a very valid value system.  5. A collaborative agenda: The agenda was fixed before the event so that it could be modified at the beginning of the Breakout.   6. Advocates Present: Not only were MVPs present, but also RDs and Student Advocates to benefit from the mingling opportunity that was available.  7. Activity Sharing: Unveiled a process by which our activities get exposed to the international audience.  8. Catch up with the Global Summit: Many of MVPs could not be at the Global Summit. We did few technical sessions to pass on some of the information that was made available at the Summit.  9. Community Contact: Proposed to interested MVPs, as a possible avenue of participation, to provide guidance to the Community Stars and other upcoming people in the community.  10. Agenda Setting Chat: To collect feedback on the agenda of the Breakout, we held an MVP chat approximately a month ago.   P.S.: Why is it called a breakout? Answer: “Breakout” is not a conference or seminar but an invitation to share and learn in a collaborative setting with emphasis on feedback. - From the website we put up.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This posting is provided "AS IS" with no warranties, and confers no rights.

          So I finally installed the Infopath SP1 from the Office 2003 SP1. Here are the steps i followed:   1. Downloaded the Office 2003 Service Pack 1from: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/results.aspx?productID=3A4E9862-CDCE-4BDC-8664-91038E3EB1E9&freetext=sp1&DisplayLang=en  2. Ran the Office 2003 SP1. 3. Ran into the following error message:  &#8220;The expected version of the product was not found on your system&#8221;.  So i dug around a little and here is how it is correctly done:  1. Uninstall InfoPath SP1 Preview  2. Run gacutil.exe /cdl  (Iinstalled with the .NET Framework SDK) 3. Run Office 2003 SP1 4. Reinstall InfoPath 2003 (by running the Microsoft Office 2003 Professional Setup program from Add/Remove Programs), and then reselecting the InfoPath check box   And this worked for me!! The Infopath SP1 forms for MVP Nomination and others are working fine with the this release as well.  The released version of InfoPath SP1 is 6357.6360. If you have any other version than this you don't have the correct version. The Infopath SP1 Preview was 6250.6360   Some new features in  InfoPath 2003 Service Pack 1: This release includes more support for InfoPath developers using managed code, digital signatures and enhanced form sharing via e-mail. Thanks to additional tools for using managed code and enhanced support for handling Extensible Markup Language (XML) schemas, developers using SP1 will find it faster and easier to create InfoPath-based solutions. End users also will benefit from additional handwriting support for Tablet PCs, improved support for InfoPath e-mail attachments and enriched support for digital signatures.  The Service Pack is 100% compatible with existing InfoPath 2003 solutions and the preview  released earlier this year. When developing new solutions with the Service Pack, you will have a choice to create forms fully compatible with InfoPath 2003 or forms that take advantage of the new feature enhancements, which include:   -More control choices, including Master/Detail, File Attachment, Recursive Section, and Choice, as well as custom-authored controls..  -Better schema support, including built-in support for schema changes.  -Printing improvements, including page breaks, margins and print settings.  -Improved e-mail deployment of sandboxed solutions and auto-updating of trusted solutions.  -Better management and categorization of solutions.  -Tablet PC support improvements.  -Increased support for rules and roles for declarative business logic.  -Enhanced XPath expression support, including calculations without writing script.  -Additional data adaptors for email and SharePoint Products and Technologies lists.  -Better support for custom migration plug-ins.  -Enhanced Object Model (OM), including OnSave event, offline state, submit, and digital signatures.  -Improved support for secondary data sources.  -Additional support for business logic written in managed code (requires a separate download).  -Enhanced OM for external automation and windowless mode for application-level calls.  -Better support for ADO datasets and diffgrams to round-trip data changes.  -Additional support for complex scripts, such as right-to-left and South Asian languages.  -Enhanced support for digital signatures, including partial signatures, non-repudiation, co-signing, and counter-signing.  -Improved stability and performance, including auto-save and data recovery.  -The InfoPath&trade; 2003 Toolkit for Visual Studio .NET is designed for developers who are interested in creating form templates in InfoPath 2003 using Visual Studio .NET 2003. The InfoPath 2003 Toolkit for Visual Studio .NET provides integration features and documentation that enable you to use Visual Studio .NET to create, debug, and build InfoPath projects that use Visual C# or Visual Basic .NET managed code. The integration features provided by the toolkit allow you to use a combination of InfoPath for form design and Visual Studio .NET for writing and debugging form code. Using the toolkit, you can create new InfoPath form templates or add managed code to existing templates.

       This was my first time attending a mixer of the Bangalore Business Networking (BBN) from www.ryze.com or any other social network..   for the mixer we paid Rs 200 for covering the expenses.. i was expecting a very informal way of gathering money.. was pleasantly surprised with the smooth management of the finances by the volunteers who daftly collected the money and created the badges... next i met Tarun.. now he is the main guy behind BBN. i had been confusing him with the other guy in the photograph he has on this ryze page..  the round of introductions that started went on till 9:00 PM ( we had started at 6:30).. and from the stash of 11 visiting cards that i have from the mixer, it is well understood the eagerness of people handing out their business cards.. the mixer this time (as i am told) was a much quieter affair..  there were people from IT (duh! this is bangalore), medicine, event management, HR, home business and garment industry... pretty varied, eh?  a very good exposure to what you don't see at workplace where Yukon is given the importance that of the national budget and Whidbey is the status of monsoon and the impending economic reliance of our farming sector :) it was nice to know garmet industry from Tirpur, home business of Tupperware and thoughts of PR professionals on Linux vs Windows debate :) (now i am close to the IT industry, what do u expect?)  Snacks and tea were the fillers. There was a dance floor with occasional loud music, but no one danced. I am told that other mixers are much wilder.. i look forward to them.. In sum total, a nice opportunity for me to meet people from diverse backgrounds and put our daily work in perspective.. though elements of fun are really needed.. i will be missing the All India Mixer, but hope to catch the next mixer whenever it happens!!  My recommendation to everyone from IT - get out and see who uses the applications we write.. it will give you an idea of why discussing UI design is sometimes more important than system architecture using SOA with robust multi server application middle tier able to excute transactions in nanoseconds ..... probably the budget with 0% excise on garment is a bigger news...

       Some good news...  Lookout that was an add-in to Outlook and let you search PSTs with balzing speed has been bought over by MSN.   My take on this ... PST will have a new format based on Lookout's architecture.. the MSN search that was greatly improved recently, will be becoming much more relevant and much more intelligent...  my concern, since it has been bought by MSN, how long would it take to get incorporated into the Microsoft Outlook? hope Outlook team moves really fast on this....

       During my recent visits to the User Group meetings, we mentioned Route64 seminar in Bangalore. Everyone was quiet. No one knew about the same. I remember getting mails from variuos newsletters about Route64. Why didn't people know? More than doing a post-mortem of why didn't people know, I set out to find how could people know? I have seen something very interesting in seminars world over. People refrain from taking calls while the delegate is presenting but would look at their SMSs and punch in the reply. Very non-intrusive way of communicating with someone breathing down your neck. It hit me that SMSs were the most effective of notification mechanisms. You carry the mobile phone everywhere (even when you are not checking your emails!!).. you can check the SMS whenever you want to.. and the retention of SMSs seems to be more than emails (given the sheer nos of emails that you receive). The solution i think would work is SMS notifications. Currently, MS doesn't have an SMS gateway that i can utilize. The other way is to send the notification via my hand held device. Is there an application that can send a blast of SMSs to 60 people at a time? they exist.......... for charge..... and I can't buy them.. Will have to write one on my own.... Here i come Mobile Application Development :) Will post on my experiences with SMS Notifier Application soon...

       The Rig Veda, refered to an Aryan people living in the highlands of Pamir in Central Asia. Almost 1000 years later, the Aryans migrated in three different directions. One journeyed towards present-day Iran, another towards Europe, and through Afghanistan.  Those Aryans who settled in Punjab became a very happy and prosperous people. They organized themselves around a caste syatem that described four specific functions of the community. The Kshatriyas of that system were the protectors of the land. However, in peace time many of their members framed the land and raised cattle.  These people, named Kurmi Kshatriyas, eventually migrated to the fertile land of Ganga and Jamuna, eventually reaching Bihar and Bengal. From 600 BC to 200 BC, the kings of Iran and Greece repeatedly attacked Punjab, forcing most of the Kurmi Kshatriyas (also known as the Kurmis) to flee even further south to Gujarat in Vadnagar and Charator in the Kheda district. Around 1400 AD, the ruler of Gujarat granted the uncultivated land of petland Talukas to the Kurmis as their new home.  The hard working Kurmis developed the land quickly. To maintain a record of the annual crops on each Pat ( a parcel of land) the ruler appointed a record keeper known as the Patlik. This name was later shortened to patel. There are several sub-castes within the Kurmi communities. Bhumihar Brahmins are land-owning Brahmins and they are different from brahmin that live from donations. Because of vast areas of land belong to bhumihar the kurmi work on some or part of the bhumihar land for a wage. The Kurmi, Kanbi, Patel, Matya etc of Gujarat probably followed the various land-owning Brahmin castes that went to Gujarat and other places to th south of the Vindya mountains a long time in the past.  The Kurmi's of Bihar are the same genetic stock as the various Kanbi Patel castes in Gujarat excluding the Koli Patels.   Kurmi's constitute around 1.4% of the Indian population.  Kurmi word has been derived from "Krish Dhatu" of Sanskrit.From history Kurmi are agrarian , thats is the meaning of word Kurmi.

       We now have XBOX in Bangalore office installed for MVPs. Obviously only Bangalore MVPs can access the amazing console right now, these will be rotated in various locations across the country. MVPs across the country will be able to experience the magic..  What's unique about this offer? XBOX is not yet released in India!! So this is your chance to preview and write a review on the device of the decade!!  In Bangalore, the XBOX is available starting July 2, 6:00 PM. MVPs could come and unwind at the Kasturba Road office with a coffee / coke and play some cool games.  I can tell you the force feedback is soooo cool that you can feel your neighbours arms shaking while you are racing with him/her. And the graphics are too good... goes without saying :) I have already spent around 4 hours since morning playing the XBOX.. ahem!! it is that addictive...  Currently, we have Gotham City Racing 2 and Crimson Skies games available on the XBOX.   And here's a challenge.. Best me to the car racing and i treat you!!  And is there some MVP who would like to donate some XBOX gaming controls from the cool MVP bucks?? :)   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This posting is provided "AS IS" with no warranties, and confers no rights.

       The MVP awards for the June cycle have been announced. the new MVPs are:  1. Chandrashekar Chivukula, Hyderabad  2. Pooran Prasad, Bangalore (now Ahmedabad)  3. Atul Gupta, Pune 4. Deepika Aneja, Delhi  5. Vipul Patel, Mumbai  6. Ruwan Dissanayake, Colombo, Sri Lanka  7. Anantha KN, Bangalore   There were a lot of excellent nominations that i would also have loved to award apart from the above. There are some people who i very much miss here. Due to limited awards, we could only award the above people.  The award process is a very stringent one driven not only by one but selection panel of various groups.   Congratulations to the one who made it and best of luck for the next time to the others who couldn't.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This posting is provided "AS IS" with no warranties, and confers no rights.

       Upgraded Hotmail (ad funded) provides: 1. 250MB of free storage 2. 10MB attachments 3. free virus scanning/cleaning (unique to MSN) 4. 500 blocked addresses (5X Yahoo) 5. Calendar and calendar sharing  Upgraded Hotmail Extra Storage/Hotmail Plus: This is a paid offer ($19.95/yr) that provides users with 2GB of storage and 20MB attachments. It also eliminates graphical ads, includes client access through Dav (OE, Outlook) and yearly account expiration.  This offer essentially matches Yahoo on storage and trumps on attachment size.   You know this already? Right... so when are you going to be seeing this implemented?  It is planned to be a staggered launch.. 1. All Hotmail users WW will receive free virus cleaning (and not just scanning) by early July (neither Google nor Yahoo offers this service)  2. Upgradation of Premium users of Hotmail and MSN will happen starting July and November respectively. 3. Users in US, UK, Japan, Australia, Canada, France, Germany and Spain will get their accounts upgraded by November. Remaining people (i.e. us in India) will be upgraded in following 12 months. A few users in US, UK and Japan will also get upgraded in late July.  Why is better than Yahoo: 1. More storage (100 MB versus 250 MB) 2. Security (Yahoo only scans while Hotmail cleans as well)  Why is it better than Gmail: 1. No protection from viruses.. so anybody could send you a virus and you will nver know till it has destroyed everything on your machine 2. No calendar or contact mangement functionality 3. No integration with Instant messaging (you can't see if a person is online or offline while you are writing an email. also known as presence management) 4. No integration with Mobile devices. (you can receive hotmail on mobile if you subscribe with the mobile service provider  Where hotmail can get beaten? 1. Anti-establishment sentiment 2. Yahoo has a great reliability record and has always provided more storage than hotmail :)  Email storage becoming a commodity (everybody has more than one email account). The real differentiator is in the reliability and value that your email accounts provides you in your daily activities!! Can someone beat the passport functionality built in with Hotmail accounts?

       The list of blogs I read are ever growing and shrinking...  Thought would share the blogs I read.. Apart from the great blogs from Indian MVPs, I really like reading the Cnet blog (always first with tech news) and Microsoft Watch from Mary Jo (insider details)  I use SharpReader as my aggregator and have exported the blog list using "Export" functionality and the file has been created as an OPML file.  Find the OPML file  urlLink here .  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This posting is provided "AS IS" with no warranties, and confers no rights.

       Well today morning someone asked me if they could access Microsoft newsgroups over Lotus Notes 5. Logically, there should be a way to access any newsgroup given NNTP is an standard and a very old protocol (giving enough time for implementation by various vendors). A little digging and here are the results of the same:  Lotus Notes 5 has support for accessing newsgroups. Earlier versions of Lotus seems to have only support for newsgroups hosted on Domino servers..   I found information at  urlLink The only information that you really have to enter is a friendly account name, which you determine for your own use, plus the server name (msnews.microsoft.com) and a protocol -- in this case, NNTP. Then, you save the account document and Notes adds a bookmark to your client. With Notes R5, the former Notes workspace is replaced by bookmarks, which provide a much faster way for getting to and managing information on desktops and the Internet. Once you click on your new NNTP bookmark, you can select from a list of newsgroups published by the server administrator, and you're on!  urlLink
