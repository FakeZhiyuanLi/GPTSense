      What's so special about Freehold, N.J., anyway? Why would anyone visit or establish a business there? Here's a little piece of history about the small township in central N.J.    While there are over 40,000 townships throughout the United States, there is only one Freehold Township. Formally established by an act of legislature in 1693, Freehold Township is one of the three original townships in Monmouth County, New Jersey.  Throughout the intervening three centuries it has been a place where people could raise a family, earn a living, and live life in some measure of peace. Freehold Township is a community situated in central New Jersey and lies equidistant from two of the largest cities in the country, New York and Philadelphia. Spanning almost 39 square miles, our town is also within a half hour's drive to the Jersey Shore.  Our community of almost 32,000 residents is home to the oldest daytime harness track in the country, Freehold Raceway, one of the area's premier shopping attractions, Freehold Mall, while managing to maintain its historically rural characteristics. The Township owns and operates 14 parks and is home to Monmouth County's Turkey Swamp Park as well as New Jersey's Battlefield State Park. Recognized as "Western Monmouth County's family town," Freehold Township is committed to safeguarding this quality of life for future generations.  Originally known as Monmouth Courthouse, this area received its namesake from 17th century property owners, who at the time, were the only ones allowed to vote. These men were seen as responsible individuals who held their possessions free and clear. In a very literal sense they were "Freeholders."

      I'm sure the question on everyone's mind is, "How do I get to this magical ice cream stand?" Fear not, intrepid ice cream junkie, for I, too, know the power of the frozen dairy treat. Like the sirens called sailors to their demise, so Jersey Freeze calls the thankfully-lactose-tolerant to rotund bellies and flabby thighs.

      I'm sure the owners and employees of Jersey Freeze will be surprised when they discover a blog devoted entirely to the landmark ice cream stand in Freehold, N.J. These days, when you decide to launch a blog, you have to be cute.   This is as cute as I get.  Even though I've only patronized Jersey Freeze a handful of times, I still view it as a symbol of my childhood in Monmouth County, in central N.J. I grew up in Colts Neck, just next door to Freehold, and drove by Jersey Freeze thousands of times. It always appeared packed with customers and I admired how a little stand like that could garner such a following as to achieve cult-like status.  This blog is my tribute to Jersey Freeze.
