						   The Airts represent the 4 directions and 4 Elements.  They are the South, East, West and North.  Some people use the Guardian Angels for their Watchtowers, some use Gods and Goddesses.  They are the Guardians of the Magick Circle.  The 4 Airts are invoked before any major ritual or magickal working.  They are invited to watch and keep guard.    Airt is a Scottish word meaning something to the effect of “Wind.” The Scottish names of the Airts are these; East -Aiet, South -Deas, West -Iar, and North -Tuath. These are the guardians of the Directions, who mark the extent and nature of existence, and who defin the limits of the Magick Circle.  Wiccans usually use the these Elements: East -Air, South -Fire, West -Water, North -Earth. These are based in their origin on the prevailing winds of Britain.  At one time, the Elements were thought to be the building blocks of Creation.  Everything that exists has some aspect of all 4 elements within them. Air represents thought, ideas, conceptions. Air represents beginnings and new things. Fire represents action and physical manifestation -creating and doing. Water represents emotion and reaction -the natural effect of responding to what has been manifested. North represents integration, wisdom, and understanding.  The 4 elements refer to the qualities that they represent, not to the literal physical representation.    There are tools that also represent the elements:  Athame represents the Element of Air in it’s connotation of Thought or Decision.  This is one of the most sacred tools and is mainly used to cast the magickal circle.  The Wand represents the Element of Fire, and the power of the God as consort of the Goddess. The Wand is primarily used in invoking the Quarters, for cleansings, and as part of certain specific rituals.  It is used to direct energy.  The Chalice is the third Sacred Tool, and represents the Element of Water, and the power of the Goddess as Mother of all creation.  A Chalice can be any type of material, glass, silver, ceramic, etc.  The Chalice is used mainly to make drink-offerings, and to pass on blessings.  The liquid used is blessed and offered as a libation, or used in magickal workings.   The Pentagram is the fourth sacred Tool. It represents the Element of Earth, and the Goddess as Union of All Things.  The Pentagram is a five-pointed star in a circle. It can be worn as a medallion or placed on your altar. The Pentagram can be used to focus energy, and also to ground it. The Pentagram also represents the Four Elements with the fifth Element being Spirit. It also represents the human form with arms and legs outspread.

						   What is an altar for?  Its to provide focus during your ritual and/or magickal workings and for worship.    The Altar needs to be set up so it has meaning for you.  There is no right way or wrong way to set up an altar.  As long as it provokes an emotional and spiritual response from you, it is set up right.   A first concern is where to put your altar.  Some people have a room just dedicated for their rituals and magickal workings.  Others have it set up in their livingroom or bedroom.  Where you put your altar is a personal decision.  Once you have a place picked out, you should figure out what direction the altar faces.  Geomancy comes into play here.   The direction of East is creativity and new beginnings. South is action and manifestation. West is emotion and the subconscious. North is wisdom.  You can align your altar to any direction you want to draw its energy or quality from.    When you set up your altar, Geomancy can be used too.  The right side of the altar is warm. It is associated with the God, the Sun, Day, physical energy, and the elements of Air and Fire.  The left side of the altar is cool. It is associated with the Goddess, the Moon and Stars, spiritual energy and magic, and with the elements of Water and Earth.  The middle of the altar is associated with Spirit, or Primeval Deity, Who is within both Goddess and God, as well as all other things.   The back part of this middle area is associated with Primeval Deity, that aspect of the Goddess that existed before the creation of the God.  The front part of the middle space represents spiritual energy manifesting in the physical world -the union of Goddess and God in the ongoing process of creation. This is where your magical working will be done. This area is normally left empty when work is not being done.  When you set up your altar, actually before, you want to purify and bless the area or room.  You want to purify and bless the altar too, as well as the tools you put on the altar.    You can use almost anything, except metal for your altar top.  It can be a dresser, coffee table, fire place mantle, etc.  Outside, it can be a big rock.    You can cover your altar top with an altar cloth...it can be handmade or bought (when handmade it is infused with your energy).  This needs to be purified and blessed as well.  Candles are important on your altar.  Bare minimum candles are the God and Goddess or one candle to represent Spirit. They represent fire.   The flame of the candle emits energy, which will expand the energy of your own workings.  You can dress your candle with essential oils for candle magick, or even put sigil in it or words.    When placing candles on your altar, the Goddess candle goes to the left, the God candle to the right, in keeping with the Geomancy of the altar as discussed above and sometimes a Spirit candle is placed between them to symbolize Their inner Unity.  YOu can also use elemental candles or candles to represent the Maiden, Mother, Crone, or even ancestors like for Samhain.  The important thing is to listen to your instinct as to how you place your candles or any of the other altar tools.  Incense is also used on the altar and it represents the element of Air.  I comes in many forms, just make sure that what ever form you use, you have the proper catchers or burners for it.    Water and Salt is put on the altar to represent Water and Earth, 2 more of the elements.  By now, you have all 4 elements represented on your altar.  You can also use the salt to ground yourself after your magickal workings or ritual. Place a bit on the tongue.    There are other items you can place on your altar too.  Libation dish for making your offering, burning dish or cauldron, images or statues of the god and goddess or family, an Earth pot filled with stones, dirt...anything that will honor Mother Earth.  You can also decorate your altar up for the Seasons, the Sabbats if you wish.    How you set up your altar is a purely individual decision, there is no right or wrong way.  Follow your instincts!

						    Vortices and the Psychic Tide   Everything that exists has energy which is held together by vibration and frequency.  Anything that has energy can affect our energy, like crystals, essential oils, perfumes, incense, places and color, as a few examples.    Some places have powerful energies called Vortices. These are powerful energy centers and are also called Chakras of the Earth. They are sacred sites.  In some of these areas healings have taken place and people go there for pilgrimages.    Artificial Vortices can be created consciously and unconsciously by living everyday.  You can create a Vortice intentionally too in a temple or a place where magic is performed. It can be imbued with psychic energy which can turn it into a powerful psychic Vortex, which will strengthen the abilities and perceptions of all who enter.  The Psychic Tide is a continual cycle of time.  These cycles range from the time it takes our Planet to revolve upon its’ axis (24 HRS) to the length of the so-called Great Year (19,200 years, according to the Correllian system). This energy is like the tide of the ocean.  When the tide is in its dark half, the energy is  moving inward.  When the tide is in its light half, the energy is moving outward.  They both need each other for balance.  They can't survive without each other.  The moons are also explained by the light/dark analogy, this is the monthly cycle.  There is also the yearly cycle which is the winter/spring.  The winter is the dark half and the spring is the light half.     The Wheel of the Year   The Wheel of the Year comprise the 8 Sabbats and 13 Esbats. The Eight Sabbats are divided into two sets of four. These are the Grand Sabbats, which are feminine and dedicated to the Goddess, and the Lesser Sabbats which are masculine and celebrate the God. The Lesser Sabbats are in nature,  Solar as are the Equinoxes and Solstices of the Sun, on which the Solar calendar is based. As the year is divided into a Dark and a Light half, there are two Grand Sabbats and two Lesser Sabbats in each.  The Sabbats are: Samhain, Yule, Imbolc, Ostara, Beltane, Litha or midsummer, Lammas and Mabon.  Esbats are the moon festivals.  They honor Deity, and are more personal.  This is when more spell workings are done. Esbats are held usually on Saturdays closest to the New or Full moon.  New moon Esbats are held at the very beginning of the lunar cycle, the Light half of the month.  Full Moon Esbats are held at the end of the Light half of the month.  The moon is at its strongest point then.  Doing magick at this time will give more energy to the work.

						   Magic is the conscious manipulation of the energy around us.  This energy is changed by our thoughts and emotions.    Magic is as much the manipulation of the Self, as the working of spells.  Internal changes are externalised and manifested using ritual. These processes are linked to the greater cycles of the God and Goddess, and their energies used to power the process of inner understanding and internal transformation. A process otherwise known as Enlightenment! Magic is done by the Higher Self.    Visualization, trance, spellcraft (using external tools such as candles, cords, etc....), ritual of various sorts, chanting and toning, all of these and many other techniques can be used to create the necessary shift in consciousness.  When working magic, put your whole being into it and practice. Concentration and focus are important.  Practice strengthens magick.  You also need to ground before, to clear your mind and after, to get rid of excess energy (Psychic Hygiene).    Magick and spells might also be used as a method for healing a colleague, helping a friend conceive or increasing your chances of getting a job.

						   This lesson is about being a witch and wicca.    Wicca is a religion.  It has to do with your relationship to the universe.  Its a path of spiritual growth.  We honor nature and all that she is.  We work with the seen and unseen...with magick.  In Wicca, we have many Deities.  Both male and female, a mother and father aspect.  Everyone understands Deity in their own way.  Deity won't be the same for me as it is for the next person.   The most common way for us to approach Deity is thru the Triple aspect of the Goddess...Maiden, Mother, Crone.  We also honor the God, her consort.    As Wiccans, we go by the Wiccan Rede....Do as you will, but harm none.  Basically this means that what ever we do, good or bad, will come back to us...what you sow, you reap.  As Wiccans, we do not harm anything unless there is a good reason behind it, like to feed or protect your family.   We are not a book religion, but we do follow a spiritual path.  There is no right or wrong way to follow your spiritual path.  Learning about and putting to practice what you learn about Wicca will change you.  You will learn about parts of you, like your higher self, that you would not have know before.

						   This lesson is about our Deity, who we choose to interact with.  Deity has many names and faces, and we interact with Deity through these. We seek guidance, inspiration, and practical help in both daily life and matters of the Spirit.  Choosing our Deity is a very personal matter.  As Wiccans, we are not made to follow or worship just one God.  We can use different Deities for whatever situation we need.  This is the personal way we see Deity.  The second way is Universal.  We know that the true nature of Deity is beyond form, beyond names and beyond our understanding.   We use our images of how we see Deity to help us understand the nature of the Divine.  We use myth to help us understand, like the creation story, The Vangelo delle Streghe.    NOTE:  Every site I went to on this Creation Story, had the same thing as this lesson had.

						   This lesson tells us about all the traditional garb used in Ritual. It discusses why Robes are used. Wearing robes makes it easier to move, to aid the flow of energy, makes you feel more in touch with your Higher Self and they look cool....lol. Here is a link to a simple Robe pattern  urlLink http://village.fortunecity.com/bernhard/864/robes.html   The way I would decorate my robe is with some really cool celtic styled trim along the neckline, hem and cuff.  The sleeves would be flowing..but not so much that they would get in the way.  I would also embroider some symbols that have meaning for me.  Maybe some power Runes, or even design a Rune Pentacle..now that would be cool.  The fabric I would choose would be a cotton, light for the summer, and heavier for the fall and winter.  For the spring and summer I would make it a forest green color, and for the winter, purple.   There are many types of Robes, and the best ones are made yourself. They can be designed very simply and decorated as you see fit. Some covens or Temples have specific robes for different purposes. Other Ritual garments include the Tabard, the Stole, Vestments, State Robes, and still others prefer no clothing, going skyclad.  This lesson also talks about your "shadow self". This the the part of us we try and hide. It includes all of our insecurites, how society says we should be, our fears, to name a few things. We have the ability to heal our shadow. The spell the lesson asks us to do, is really eye opening. I did it and I did start to feel better and stronger about myself. I see myself in a whole new light now. I plan on using a version of this spell for other things other than self image tho. I can see the benefits. But then when it comes down to it, isn't everything really controlled by how we see ourselves? Society puts pressure on us to be a certain way, our parents pressure us to succeed where they couldn't, our peers pressure us to be like them. When we don't conform to what others think we should be like, it damages our self image unless we are strong enough in our selves to overcome it.

						   This lesson talks about Invocation.&nbsp; Where you call on the god or goddess to be with you during ritual, for them to be in your presence.&nbsp; When you invoke your diety, do it in trust, invoke from the heart.&nbsp; Envision them as a ball of energy or however you want to envision them.&nbsp; Imagine your diety strongly.  It also talks about Universal Diety&nbsp; and Patron Dieties.&nbsp; My patron Diety is Bridgit.&nbsp; Having a personal relationship with your Diety is very important.&nbsp; You need to keep the lines of communication open with them.&nbsp; Offerings to your dieties are appreciated, and always treat your diety with respect.&nbsp;   There are 7 archtypes of Diety...Goddess--Maiden, Mother, Crone &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God--Hero, lover, King, Sorcerer  There are also many Pantheons (Celtic, Greek, Egyptian, etc) and each of these pantheons have there own gods and goddess and archtypes.&nbsp;   Patron dieties usually choose you by dreams, pictures, meditations, being drawn to them.&nbsp; Its perfectly ok not to have one though, and equally ok to have more than one.&nbsp;

						   The Magick Circle.  Wiccans use the magick circle in Ritual or even sometimes for spell casting.  The first thing needing to be done is making your sacred space.  Cleanse and purify the area of negative energies.  Using your Athame, point it straight ahead to the East, imagining a beam of white light shooting from the tip of the athame.  Continue in a Doesil direction till you come back the the East.  Imagine yourself drawing a line or boundry with the white light.  Focus on making the boundry strong.  You can even speak some words if you would like to. Since you can't break the circle once it is drawn, you can cut a door for anyone who has to leave, but remember to close it back up.  Next you Call the Quarters, beginning in the East, move Doesil again.  You can use specially prepared words or improvise.  You can also have candles for the quarters and light them as you make your round.    Next, you would invoke the Diety or Dieties of your choice.  Then you would do what you had planned, magick, special prayers, etc.  When you release the circle, thank the God and/or Goddess, then dismiss the quarters beginning in the north and move Tuathail, speak words thanking the quarters for participating.  You can imagine your white light going back into the earth.  Blow out any candles you have lit.    To take down or uncast your circle begin in the east and hold out your athame.  Move Tuathail and imagine the beam of light going back into your athame.  You can also say something as well when doing this.
