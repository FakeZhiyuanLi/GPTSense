       urlLink President Bush's Eulogy at Funeral Service for President Reagan   I got the opportunity today to watch the State Funeral for President Reagan.  Among the speakers was of course our current President, George W. Bush.  In what was probably the most eloquent speech the President has given, he closed by saying, "We lost Ronald Reagan only days ago, but we have missed him for a long time."  How true.  President Reagan shaped me as I grew up during his administration.  Through his example, I learned what a President, an American, and a good person should be.  He did things not based upon poll numbers or expediency, but what was right in principle.  His example, I hope, our current and future leaders will take.  My thoughts and prayers go out to the Reagan family as I, along with my country mourns the loss of not only a great President, but a great man.

      As per web tradition I had to make my first post titled  First Post .  Kind of cliche I know, but hey, I'm a tool anyways (just like Carson Daily).  Anyways (a word which I hate but always seem to use), I got sick of trying to maintain my pseudo blog/live journal that I had on my website, maybe I'll move these posts over at some time, who knows, but for now this is easier and will do.  So I guess at this point, in continuance of being cliche, I'll do the whole introduction thing.  Why I'm doing this I really don't know, because you are here for one of 3 reasons: 1.  You are a friend or family and actually know me, thus introductions would be redundant 2.  You mistyped something in the URL or have run out of web pages to look at, thus an introduction would be meaningless. 3.  I don't know you but you are stalking me.  So I guess you might know something about me already (see 1).  Now to those of you in #3, I really don't mind being stalked all that much, in fact I'm actually quite fond of my stalkers.  But a word of warning, I'm boring.  Also if you are a guy, no offence, but I don't bat from that side of the plate.  So if you are stalking me and don't mind the monotony of my life and are a reasonably attractive person, lets see what we can do to get you into that #1 category alright?  So on with the introduction: Job:  I work at a large fraternal Insurance/Financial institution in Appleton.  Basically I work there in the Technolgoy Service Center helping our very wonderful field staff out with their computers.  Not that I don't mind helping people restart their computers and copying and pasting their MS Office documents, but with a bachelors degree in Computer Science, this isn't what I had in mind.  Now I realize this is a foot in the door job, so hopefully I'll be moving up the corporate latter, problem is that someone has to get off that rung above me, then about a mile's worth of paper and red tape corporate buracracy has to follow to even give me the opportunity to get to that next step.  But like I said I'm hopeful.  Until then I'm working my tail off trying to do as best I can, while not snapping. non-Job:  This is the part of my life I enjoy the most.  I am extremely involved with Common Ground a young adult ministry in the Green Bay area that meets on Sunday nights.  Also I'm a huge movie buff and will watch pretty much anything once. Hobbies:  I like to say that I like to go biking (although I'd need a bike to be able to go).  So in the mean time I do the hiking/occasional jog thing.  I also pretend to work on cars, basically that means being the "hold this" guy when my rommate/friends are working on their cars.  I also am trying to grow a Bonsai tree.  A blue juniper to be exact.  We'll see how long it takes for me to kill it.  Oh yeah, I also do the computer thing as well, part of being a geek I guess.  Well enough introduction, I need to sleep.  Work tomorrow!  Until next time...   One adendum, I also want to remember Ronald Reagan's life with a request for prayers for his family.  He was the greatest President of my life, probably will continue to be for the rest of it.

      Funny picture:    I could not believe this picture when I saw it.  Sure enough, it is not a fake, it is owned by Reuters.  If only it weren't an optical illusion.    Ref:  urlLink Yahoo! News - Politics Photos - Reuters
