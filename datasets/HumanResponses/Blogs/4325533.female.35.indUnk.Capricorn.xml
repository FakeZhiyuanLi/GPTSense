      "Good morning! We are pleased to inform you that the memorial you have been waiting for has now been installed ... Please examine the memorial at your earliest convenience. It is our wish to ensure that it meets your expectations."  Yes, this came from a cemetery, and yes, it is regarding my husband's headstone. He killed himself in June. Just looking at this letter makes my hands shake.  I must think happy thoughts now. I really must.  I think I'll go sort my recycling now. That's somewhat therapeutic, and even cathartic, when you can shatter glass and whatnot.

      I started listening to Johnny Thunders &amp; the Heartbreakers live at Max's Kansas City in 1979. I was halfway through "Milk Me" when I realized that I wouldn't be falling asleep anytime soon. So now I'm listening to  Night of the Living Dead Boys,  their last show with the original line-up, at CBGB's, also in 1979.  Eventually I'm going to write a big, rambling expose on a lot of the great proto-punk bands from Cleveland in the early and mid-'70s. Of particular interest: Rocket from the Tombs, Electric Eels, the Mirrors and the Styrenes. I think my favorite song on this Dead Boys record is definitely "Ain't It Fun," which was a RFTT song written by Peter Laughner, who died at age 24 from acute pancreatitis following major drug and alcohol problems. He was a fucking amazing songwriter, but like many talented people, he couldn't really keep it together.  The lyrics remind me of my late husband, who also died young, after a life of broken promises and unmet expectations. "Ain't it fun when you tell her she's just a cunt. Ain't it fun when she splits you and leaves you on the run. Well, ain't it fun when you broken up every band that you ever begun. Ain't it fun when you know that you're gonna die young." I see that Guns 'n Roses covered this amazing song, and I would imagine that their version sucks beyond belief. So, Peter Laughner died young, Stiv Bators died young, and fucking Axl Rose is still alive and kicking. Whoever said life was fair?  I plan to also delve into my fascination with Weimar Cinema, particularly Fritz Lang, Lotte Eisner and Ernst Lubitsch. But that, my friends, will have to wait for another lonely insomniac night.

      It took a while. I'm not the sharpest person in the world when it comes to this computer stuff. I will use this platform mostly to share my tastes in obscure music and movies and left-wing politics with the world.  It is now late, too late for me to be up any longer, so perhaps I will write more tomorrow.
