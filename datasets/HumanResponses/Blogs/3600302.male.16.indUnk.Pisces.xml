      I was reading over my blog (and no, it's not the sprinkled grammar errors that bother me) and I was irked by my so-called "philosophical" posts.  Do I sound stupid or what?  I can't believe I'm annoying myself.  Blah, guess I just don't think when I'm bored and feel like writing random things...  Hm...today.  I went swimming, broke a bracket, got in an argument with my dad (like every day), and ate chicken.  Thrilling, I know.  Then I talked to Veronica about where to plant her "flowers" (long story).  And now I'm writing in this thing...Gah.    I suppose I could go look at random topics on wikipedia, but I'm tired.  Whilst pondering the depths my infinitely deep mind, I just remembered I have soccer!  Yay, my day is saved from all that is known as boredom.

      Well, Scott Greiner has informed I'm "weird." Thanks for the comment (but at least I'm not short!).  Well, if I'm weird, than I'm scared to know what Marilyn Manson is (pyschotic?).  Well, he's not weird, just a little...out there...  I am sunburnt like a mother.  Our soccer team had a game at this kid on our soccer team's house (whose mom is a MILF! We like to rub it in.) and he lived by Lake Lansing and had a boat so we went tubing.  Seriously, I haven't had that much fun in a LONG time.  It was crazy, and then Emery's swimsuit kept falling off and Marco's mom (another guy on our soccer team) was covering her daughter's eyes.  Hilarious, man.  Then we ate pizza and I think I ate most of the cookies (they were so good!!!) and um...played soccer, lost a badminton to my dad, threw Hal in the water, threw water balloons at each other, did random stuff, went home and fell asleep.    Then I went swimming today.  I am one out of shape mofo.  I could barely sprint four one-hundreds.  Ick.  Well, that, and I'm sunburnt up the ass so it wasn't exactly fun.  There's always two-a-days tommorrow.  WHOOT!    I was reading a friend's profile, and he had a quote about how a happy man was either evil, selfish, ignorant, etc.  I'm sure that applies to  some  people, but not all.  Why can't anyone be hapy?  Because everyone is too worried about the world, themselves, others.  Maybe if we all relaxed and took time to view the world and weren't so pissy, depressed, hateful, people would be happy.  However, as long as their are humans, taht's not going to happen.  There are moods where we aren't happy, but the only thing that's keeping you from being happy is yourself.  You should celebrate every breath twice:  Life is a gift (as corny as that is) and it wasn't some evil intent on making your life miserable.  You SHOULD be happy most of your life, but that's impossible.  Maybe if you looked at the bright side every so often, life wouldn't suck.    Well, time to go off to my cousin's open house!

      Seeing as how I have nothing else to do, I'm going to write in this thing.  What joy.    Anyhow, continuing with what I'm going to write in here. Well, I don't have much else to write.  Hm...I suppose I could post some of my favorite songs in here; like that's not cliché.  I'm going swimming in like twenty minutes!  WHOOT!  And by "swimming", I don't mean the pansy find-the-best-swimsuit-splash-around-in-the-water swimming, I mean EXERCISE swimming.  I love the sport, man (it's not as fun as soccer, mind you).  I haven't swum in a little over three months, so it's gonna hurt; but I'm not doing anything difficult because I'm just starting up again.  But it'll be fun.  Then, since the weather has semi-cleared up, I'm going to go running when I get home and then do some core training.  Fun stuff, man.    Alas, the poison ivy still plagues my arm.  I'm thinking of taking a blow torch to it, but that might hurt.  Oh well, it's going away.    Whilst I was cleaning my oh-so-lovable bathroom, I was thinking of something I was going to write in here, but I can't seem to remember it now...must be the Alzheimer's (Don't worry, I'm kidding).    Fourteen more minutes to occupy...What to talk about?  Well, if any of you are remotely interested in what I write, here's a link to my writing:     http://www.fictionpress.com/~omzack   Well, thrill yourself with that.    Here's an interesting song:  Vocal: Scott Matthew Words: Tim Jensen Music: Yoko Kanno   Lithium Flower   she's so cold and human it's something humans do she stays so golden solo            she's so number nine  she's incredible math just incredible math  and is she really human? she's just so something new a waking lithium flower just about to bloom I smell lithium now smelling lithium now  how is she when she doesn't surf? how is she when she doesn't surf? how is she when she doesn't surf? I wonder what she does when she wakes up? when she wakes up  so matador so calm so oil on a fire she's so good she's so goddess lithium flower so sonic wave yeah, she's so groove, yeah she's so groove yeah  wow, where did she learn how to surf? wow, where did she learn how to surf? wow, where did she learn how to surf? you know I've never seen the girl wipe out  how does she so perfectly surf? how does she so perfectly surf? how does she so perfectly surf? I wonder what she does when she wakes up?  I wanna go surfing with her I wanna go surfing with her I wanna go surfing with her I wanna go surfing with her  It's the ending song to the new Ghost in the Shell series, Ghost in the Shell:  Stand Alone Complex.  I have yet to watch the rest of it...it's been a LONG time since I watched any anime.  *tear*    You know what really bugs me?  When people are like "fuck this country", "I hate this country 'cause everyone is gay" or "I hate the government."  Do they actually have a REASON?  They say people are killing each other every minute in this country and that they want to leave as soon as possible.  Well, aren't they just helping the cause?  Instead of sitting on your ass and getting high, how about doing something instead of just saying you hate this country.  People are just retarded, apparently.  And what's up with those who say they hate the government?  Do they actually realize what the government does?  Someone who was highly-educated in that area might be able to comment; but a thirteen-year old kid?  I think not.  I am not one of those government-infatuated myrmidons, but I certainly don’t depise their every move.  Well, that’s one of my mini-rants for the day.  ^__^  I was watching something on the Discovery Science channel on how people were trying to find when the universe was going to end.  Apparently this group of scientists are working around-the-clock to find out.  They were analzying supernovas and checking to see where they were and stuff like that (They didnt' explain it in depth to us).  They made it sound dramatic—TOO dramatic.  Especially the eerie voice of that narrator *shudder*  People, the universe (if it's ever going to end) won't end for like quadrillions, quintillions, nonillions, and so on, of years!  Sheesh, so crazy.  Ironicaly, they discovered the universe is actually expanding and that there may be some force fighting against gravity.  Eh...there's more, but it's not important.    Well, that's all I didn't really need to say, but felt like it anyway.  Time for swimming!

      Well, I will send Friar Gungbueuler off to fetch some wood.  Then I will climb into the Dragon's mouth, and remove the chemical pouch that ignites its fiery.  Then by using gravitation microlensing I will determine the existence of five new planets orbiting Aldeberan.  By using a Drake Euation variant, I will determine if the life on these planets is intelligent.  Then by using my advanced radio coummunicator, I will beam them a message explaining how to grow christmas trees.  By using a spectrum analysis of their world, I will have determined the position of the marshmellows in the universe.  Then, by following the directions on the back of the bag of marshmellows, I will toast them on the open fire created by the cows.

      Why am I even writing in one of these things?  They're awful.  What is the point?  Well, I'm utterly bored beyond all comprehension so I guess I decided to write one of these things...  Anyhow, what am I suppose to put in here?  What do you want to know?  I'm sure there's some unanswered question about my personality you're all longing to hear.  Yeah right.  Yadda, yadda, yaddda...  Well, if you want a description of the first day of Summer, here it is:  It sucked.  It's raining...the gym is closed....treadmill's broken...I have poison ivy...my knee is swollen...I'm bored.    Well I could write some obscure message about of the end of the world and that peanut butter crackers are really a government conspiarcy and we're all doomed because plastic is really an alien mind control device, but I'll spare the quixotic comments.    The basics:    I am 5'9'' Hispanic I was born in Brownsville, Texas (REPRESENT!) Hal Morley is ugly.   I have an Irish soccer coach with two kids and a Yankee wife.   I had a dream about stealing doughnuts two nights ago.    I think that takes care of most everything.  Well, being serious, I enjoy many things in life...particularly not writing in this thing...but anyhow, moving on.  Soccer is my love in life and I woudln't have anyone take its place because my soccer ball is hotter than every girl I know (save for Selma Hayek, but it's not like I have a chance).  Anime, writing, oh and some obscure thing I can't think, but will eventually, are fun hobbies when I'm not playing soccer.  Running is fun (not heartwicks...evil) and lifting weights.  I like soccer.  Music is fun to listen to.  Soccer's a pretty fun sport.  Oh, Corpus Christi is where I wish I was (but I'm stuck in Holt, Michigan).  But hey, what is there NOT to love about Michigan?  I mean, it snows and it rains!  And the closest beach is an hour and the entire population of this state is bitchy.  I just love my life.    What more is there to say?  I think I'm gonna go play soccer.

      What is there to do when your bored and sittin' on the computer desk?  Eat pancakes, what else...   Other than that, I don't know...life's a mystery.  And to all my dear fans who read this oh-so-intelligible blog, I am so sorry for not writing in here for an extended amount of time...like anyone reads it.  Okay, moving on to new and better things.    What the hell is up with the the title to this post?  Felt like being random, it's cool.  Or most likely it's from  Anchorman .  Duh, Zach, you're so stupid.  That was a pretty funny movie.  Some memorable moments from it:    Ron Burgundy:  Downstairs?  What do you mean?  Veronica Corningstone:  *looks nervous and attempts to point down* Ron Burgundy:  *still confused* Veronica Corningstone:  MR. BURGUNDY, YOU HAVE A   MASSIVE  ERECTION   The Weather guy:  I love lamp Ron:  Are you just saying that? Weather guy:  I love couch...I love desk   Weather guy:  I ate fiberglass once...it wasn't cotton candy like the guy told me it was.    Baxter (the dog): Bark bark bark Ron:  Baxter, you know I don't speak Spanish.  Baxter:  Bark bark bark   It was funny...   Good times, man. SPEAKING OF GOOD TIMES OFU MONDAY!  Haha, can't hardly wait for more firework-induced goodness.  My "fish" can't hardly wait.    But onto more serious topics, like Texas.  Diving nose-first:  I don't get it.  Everything—EVERYTHING for three years has had something to do with this place.  And I go back, and it's not special anymore.  It's not...what it is in my dreams.  It's lost its innocence, and I couldn't put a finger on it.  The only thing left now is to forget it, but that is amazingly hard...more than hard and more than words can express. I don't know what's left of it—but I DO know, and it just isn't the same Corpus Christi it once was.  Goodbye...forever.    Well, in other news, I'm in love with a cow named Elsie and we're getting married next month.  That was more like written off nervous energy...don't know why.  Not like me.    Well, Texas has officially screwed up my sleeping patterns, but it's all good in the hood.  But it's off to bed for now.    Find out why Zach pulled his hamstring in the next thrilling issue of  Zach:  The Soap Opera continues .
