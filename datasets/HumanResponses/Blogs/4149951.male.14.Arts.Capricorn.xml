						   I feel odd sometimes coz when i though i was Bi-sexual no guy would look my way.But now that i'm Str8 all these guys keep giving me these looks. like "damn that nigga Fine!" and they try to talk to me and be my boyfriend. but i'm looking for the ladies I never really liked men i only tried it coz some of my friends did-that was real smart of me-. And even a few of my friends are trying to get something from me. But they all know i don't get down like that. but i gotta go love peace and Chicken Grease,    Kieran Adams
