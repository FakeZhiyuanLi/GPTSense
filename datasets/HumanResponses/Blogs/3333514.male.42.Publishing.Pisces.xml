       With Mom and young Brownie at an all day Girl Scout "encampment", Dad and the Dude had things to get done. Took the monthly trip to the old neighborhood for shearing and donuts (Bob's Barber Shop and the  urlLink Scandia Bake Shop ).   On the way home stopped off at the  urlLink Parkview Cafe . I've driven by it for almost three years but never stopped. Took a little coaxing to get the Dude in the door. He had his heart set on McDonalds. He was convinced to stay when I told him the Parkview served malts.   Great meal: shared a cheeseburger, fries, and vanilla malt (boring, but his choice).  They have those "real" hamburgers - - the kind they put together by hand (I guess). Not mass-produced. Very tasty, and great atmosphere - a mix of neighborhood types and the young and hip - - I suspect they are from the neighborhood as well. Large American flag on back wall which prompted the Dude to comment: "Hey this is an American restaurant." He's fascinated with the flag lately. If you ever need to count flags in your neighborhood, take him for a ride. He never misses one.

       Eventful week in my bird world. Was able to add Rose Breasted Grosbeak and Nashville Warbler to my yard list. Unfortunately the Warbler was found dead on our front step (hit the glass) - but that's still in the yard.  On my noontime walk today spotted a Bluebird (first of season). Nice to see that some Bluebirds actually get to use the Bluebird nesting boxes. Swallows usually get their first. Also spotted a mystery bird. Greenish-yellow underneath, darker - possible brown on top. About size of Robin. Bullocks Oriole??

       Stumbled upon  Flight of the Phoenix , by Elleston Trevor, at the local library. It was on the staff recommendation shelf. Published in 1964, it tells the story of a small group of men whose plane crashes into the Libyan desert. One of them figures out how to cobble together a plane or sorts out of the wreckage. During the construction of the plane there are many battles with hunger, thirst, and sanity. It's the kind of book that would be good to read in the middle of a long winter - - you really get hot and thirsty reading it. The book was made into a movie in 1965. Must try to find it - starred Jimmy Stewart, Richard Attenborough, Enerest Borgnine, George Kennedy and others. A new version of the movie is in production, scheduled for 2004 release.

       Many say that you should follow your passion. Do what you love to do. OK, I’ll go with that. What do I like to do? Read blogs, and follow the paths (links) from news, to art, to politics, and back. It’s fascinating, and you really are exposed to a variety of perspectives. Time to "give back" as it were.

       Been working on  Puff the Magic Dragon  on my guitar. Stumbled upon it accidentally - discovered the first three chords (C,Emi,F) just doodling around. Downloaded the whole thing from some guitar tab site. Quite easy actually - didn't have to learn any new chords. Surprised to learn it was written by PPM (really Peter or was it Paul and some other guy).   Getting fairly good at it. Was playing it on the deck a week or two ago while the kids were running around backyard. Neighbor girl walks up and asks what I'm playing.   Puff the Magic Dragon , I said. Silence - she'd never heard of it.   Kids today - Sheesh.

       I love going to libraries – any libraries. Childhood memories of going to the old Richfield library with my father – I can still smell all the books on the shelves and see the large globe in the entryway (if that’s where it really was). Libraries are full of opportunity: so many books to read, so much opportunity. If you pick a book you don’t like, simply return it. No money wasted like Barnes and Noble, except for tax dollars. Now as a parent I am struck by the dichotomy of the library as a place of quiet study and reading and its “public space” functions and children’s room where noise rules. So I wrote this little poem. A library would be a nice place to spend eternity. Just the right combination of quiet rest and contemplation, and a glimpse to the boisterous screaming, laughing future.    Bury Me in the Library   When I die, bury me in a library.  To lay forever beneath it’s quiet floors, slamming doors Trod upon by muffled feet, and scurried over by laughing shrieks Catching up on books unread, Sharing my thoughts with both living and dead.  ©2004, John Gisselquist

       Drove the Dude to pre-school today. With partly-sunny skies and a predicted high of 75, many would be surprised to see him in his winter boots! But not those who know him in his new role -  urlLink Rescue Hero . Apparently a Rescue Hero always wears boots - and a walkie-talkie on his belt. I carried along a pair of tennis-shoes, despite his insistence that he would not wear them. "Rescue Heroes don't wear tennis-shoes, they wear boots." I am able to get him to remove the walkie-talkie during class. We stash it in his "cubbie". I've convinced him that others will answer the call when he's "off duty".

       OK - I get annoyed when people don't post regularly, so I better do the same myself. Went out for walk at noon. It's the kind of day when it's hard to return to your desk. Sunny, light breeze, in the low 60s at the time.   Family on the mend: Dude on antibiotics and S is snuffling along. I felt a little under-the-weather (tired, swollen glands) yesterday, but seem to be feeling better today. Must be my Yoga.   S received yoga "stuff" for her birthday: video, DVD, along with mat and other props. I've started using them regularly (about 30 minutes each am), and I think it's working. I have become more flexible, my posture has improved, and I actually enjoy the down-ward facing dog. Still can't run worth beans, but I try to walk every day and that works fine.

       Having some troubles these days with the aggressive little "Rescue Hero" in our lives. I've been puzzling over the question of violence in our culture and the little terror in our house.  Here's an interesting  urlLink article  discussing a subject I've been thinking of lately: What makes little boys violent? The article starts by addressing the "cleaning up" of cartoons and the effect it might have on our children, especially boys. [Warning: this article is written from a conservative point of view, but some friends and family might find it interesting nonetheless.]   One author has a better idea. In his superb and unfairly overlooked 2002 book,  Killing Monsters , former comic book author Gerard Jones proposes that society needs an entirely different approach to the issue of violence in children's entertainment. He suggests that children respond strongly to violent entertainment because the violence mirrors their own feelings of aggression -- and those feelings of aggression are legitimate and worthy of expression. Rather than struggling hopelessly to eliminate childhood aggression, we should teach children to harness and employ aggressive feelings in socially useful ways.  I gotta find that book.

       Had to sing the "We Are Goin' to the Cabin" song this morning, as wife rolled her eyes and children groaned. Leaving at 2:00 for a hopefully warm and dry weekend at the "new" cabin. Weather reports don't look too promising so let's cross our fingers.  Dude and I went to Target last night and purchased his very own fishing pole. It's a kid's pole with a firefighter theme. Quick what comes to mind when you think of fishing? Firefighters? No?   Bringing the digital camera so hope to post pictures upon our return.  For those unfamiliar with the song, it's easy to sing (or chant):   We Are Goin' to the Cabin, We Are Goin' to the Cabin, We Are Goin' to the Cabin, We Are Goin' to the Cabin, We Are Goin' to the Cabin, We Are Goin' to the Cabin, We Are Goin' to the Cabin, (repeat - while strutting around the room, wiggling your butt)

       Good article in  urlLink New York Times  today about blogging,    Of course, most of those millions are abandoned or, at best, maintained infrequently. For many bloggers, the novelty soon wears off and their persistence fades.   Sometimes, too, the realization that no one is reading sets in. A few blogs have thousands of readers, but never have so many people written so much to be read by so few. By Jupiter Research's estimate, only 4 percent of online users read blogs.  Indeed, if a blog is likened to a conversation between a writer and readers, bloggers like Mr. Wiggins are having conversations largely with themselves.   Stop me if I get this crazy.

       Might as well admit it I addicted to yoga. I spend far too much time at the  urlLink Yoga Journal  web site. Did you know they have streaming video of the various postures, complete with multiple views of the pose and coaching techniques? They do – very cool. I’m working on the “perfect” morning practice. Tried a Sun Salutation I found on the YJ site, but it didn’t offer enough poses. The article recommended working through it 5 or so times, but I can’t do that many downward-dogs without my shoulders exploding. Now I’m back to usual morning routine and it’s working pretty well. Can really feel improvement through my shoulders and neck – didn’t realize how much I hunch. 8 hours a day at the computer can do that to you. I sit taller, walk taller, and can even sit cross-legged on the floor!   For what it’s worth: I may not have the much sought after “yoga butt” but now I can turn all the around and look at my butt.

       On May 14, I was puzzling over a bird on saw on my noon walk. That mystery has now been solved thanks to my birding colleague - recently returned from vacation - who suggested  urlLink Great Crested Flycatcher . This is exciting news, and embarassing as well. I'd never heard of a Great Crested Flycatcher. In this crazy world it's the little things that make your day.

       It was a quick trip to Willmar yesterday - a family get together for the Nordeen clan. Homemade donuts and caramel rolls were consumed. While there is life after Myrtle, it's definitely not the same without her.   Families are like the universe, expanding all the time. If the "Big Bang" was the marriage for Grandma Julia and Grampa Ed, you watch the evolution over the years as waves and waves of new Nordeens are born, expanding out further and further away from the New London/Spicer/Willmar area. We may not have gone too far physically - most are still in Minnesota - but we don't see each other much anymore.   Self-pity aside, I could do my part to prolong life in the universe by scheduling get togethers more often.

       Kids and I went to the Summer kick-off event at the Roseville Library today. Lots of fun - but when isn't it fun to eat hot dogs, popcorn, ice-cream, and lemonade at  10:45 AM  while sitting on a curb in a parking lot! Dad steered clear of the hot-dogs - I usually stay away from beef by-products until after noon.   Signed up for the summer reading program, prizes after reaching 8 and 20 hours of reading (or being read to in Bone's case). Much fun inside the library as we watched the show of "Bruce the Bug Guy". The guy really knows how to work an audience. The best part was when he puts three bugs each in a series of tupperware containers and places them on the floor for a little audience participation. Everyone just stared as we sat gathered around our creepy dish. All the kids claimed they wanted to touch the bugs but didn't actually dare to take their hands out of their laps. The two moms in my circle were supportive, but offered no help. (One actually kept quite a brave face as it looked like she might faint at any minute.) As you may have guessed, your hero, stepped forward and picked up the  urlLink giant millipede . This little lovely was dark brown, measured about 6 inches long, and was about 1 inch in circumfrince. With 248 legs (according to Bruce)it looked like a cigar come to life. It tickled as it worked its way up my hand to my wrist, then my arm. Doddy wanted to try, so I gently pulled the critter off - the legs gently popping off my skin - he really had a grip! The Dude did a pretty good job and seemed to enjoy himself. Eventually the other kids warmed to the occasion and "petted" the little monster.  Having mastered the millipede, I just had to try the  urlLink "Hissing Cockroach"  - so named because when alarmed it hisses - I kid you not. Of course if lived up to its name when I lifted him from the dish, hissing at me and the kids as if on cue. Very cool! This guy was a little creepy, about 4 inches long! No one really like this guy.   A few minutes after the bug show I made the mistake of licking my finger tip to turn a page (it's a library after all). I wish I could say it tasted like chicken. It didn't - very bitter - very bitter.

       68 degrees and sunny for the noon walk. Lot's of folks out on the path. One woman even had her binoculars and Kenn Kaufman  urlLink field guide  - what a geek! Actually I envy her - she's got guts. People were staring at her. I keep binoculars in my cube, but just use them for staring out the window. I have a 6th floor view of the West "Woods" from my cube. Under the old West Publishing, my teams' space was occupied by executive offices. Those lucky enough to be next to windows are sitting pretty!  Saw my first Monarch butterfly. Don't know if that's early (or late). Maybe I just haven't been paying enough attention.

       Had dinner with my Mom last night. It was her 75th birthday. We plan to celebrate later this month with entire gang, but couldn't let the day go by without a little celebration. I arrived bearing a card and small plant - and tons of  urlLink rhubarb ! The woman had over a dozen birthday cards on her window ledge! I've never had that many cards before. Must be nice!  We had dinner in the dining room. She lives in a seniors' place: Not a nursing home or assisted living - but no one under 60 and most in their 70s and 80s. At the next table was their most famous resident - George somebody who is 102 years old. The man was dining with three other men - probably in their late 70s or 80s. George carried most of the conversation. At the end of the dinner he stated in a booming voice, "Nice to have your company tonight gentleman." As he rises he lets fly with this, "Hope you get into mischief, but don't get into trouble." It struck me as funny - never heard it before. I suppose when you are 102 you've heard a lot of things. His companions left by the back-door, but George exited through the main entrance. This resulted in him "working the room" going table-to-table chatting with friends. He does wear hearing aids, but he hardly stoops, walks unassisted, and doesn't look a day over 85. And I mean that as a compliment.   Mom is looking good at 75. Didn't want a big celebration, "Seventy-five is nothing!" she assured me. And it isn't if you have friends in their 80s, 90s, and 100s. My aunt lives in the same building as my Mom. She is 80+ and going strong, traveling all over the US, gardening, etc. Another friend of my Mom's, one of the "girls" as she calls them, turns 90 this week. This 90 year old lives in her own house, mows her own lawn, and recently helped her grandkids redecorate their kitchen - wallpaper and more.   Here's hoping I see 102!

       Today's NYT  urlLink article  article on rhubarb, has cousin  urlLink Blair  musing over his own love of the stalk.   Have I mentioned that I absolutely adore rhubarb? No, probably not. Every summer, my grandfather would harvest what seemed to be a neverending supply of rhubarb from one of his gardens. Then, my grandmother would take these simple stalks and produce strawberry-rhubarb jam, strawberry-rhubarb sauce, rhubarb sauce, the occasional strawberry-rhubarb pie, rhubarb bars, and so forth.   Blair's grandfather and grandmother are my godparents, the incredible aunt/uncle duo of  urlLink Myrtle  and Ole.  H and S, with a little help from the Dude, picked rhubarb from the farm this weekend. We came home with a 40 lb bag of the stalks, some almost 3 feet in length. Add this to the never-ending supply in our own yard, and that's a lot of rhubarb. So far this year we've had rhubarb sauce, rhubarb bars, rhubarb torte - and probably a few others I overlooked.   Forget the "beer belly". Is it possible to get a "rhubarb belly"?

       Raining cats and dogs at noon, so rather than walking outside on the nice path past the pond and through the woods, I opted for the "interior route". Our company Intranet has two maps available: the exterior routes, totaling almost 2+ miles; and the interior route which consists of walking all six floors of the building, and the lower-level, from the northern-most staircase to southern-most. The interior route didn't look too bad. It's 1.2 miles of climate controlled walking, with some stairs thrown in for extra measure.   I made it two floors before going crazy. I started on 6th and began to work my way down. In the middle of 4, as I passed the cafeteria, I lost it.  Maybe it's all my years as a runner that cause me to rebel against indoor exercise. Yoga doesn't bother me because that's like stretching - something we always did  inside  before going  outside  to run. Attempts to use a Nordic Trak usually peter out after a few weeks. It's like one of those dreams where you are always trying to get somewhere, or complete some task, but you just can't do it. "But John," everyone always says, "Just listen to some music or watch TV. That's what I do." That's all well and good, but I prefer the great outdoors without electronic stimulation.    Next time I tell you I plan to walk the "interior route" - stop me.

       Can't say we need rain. Got plenty of it this weekend. Spent two days at the newly renovated Chez Crosson. Nice and dry. Who would have thought twelve years ago - when I first visited the cabin  - that I would be standing in front of a gas fireplace with a remote in hand puzzling over the proper settings. Is that #2 for heat, and #3 for fan - - yes that's it! Gone are the days of trudging out to the shed, chasing away the rodents to grab a log or two, then trudging back to the damp, cold cabin to try to start a fire. Oh - and all this had to be done quietly for fear of waking the Crosson women. Never wake a sleeping Crosson woman.   Highlights:   Fishing  - During a break in the rain the Dude, Dad, and M got to dip their lines in the water from the neighbor's dock. Amazing fishing - we caught bass, sunnies, and rock-bass. Probably a dozen in 30 minutes, before the cold, damp weather chased us back inside.    urlLink    .&nbsp; urlLink      No Bread  - I mean "Demon Carbs". In the past we could count on H for a pre-cabin visit to Breadsmith or some other specialty bakery. The cabin stocked was well with many exotic breads - but no more. Breads are carbohydrates - verboten under the South Beach Diet (SBD). As long as H & J remain on the SBD, I will have to supply my own bread. At least I don't have to step outside to eat it - yet.    On a brighter note, H had a wonderful recipe for scones from Doctor Weil. Very good, and incredibly healthy! There may have been carbs involved, but I didn't say anything. Thank goodness Goodman's Sausage doesn't have carbs - though I don't think any of us want to explore the ingredients too closely.   Home Front  - A busy day back in R-Ville. Completed the raised vegetable bed. Many wheelbarrow loads of dirt for that. Lord knows I will feel that tomorrow. S was able to plant the first "crops" - beans, peas, carrots, beets, asparagus, lettuce, and zucchini.

       Lunch-time at the salad bar. I spied the "shredded turkey" and applied it liberally to my greens. Since turkey was the entree of the day it seemed logical that shredded turkey was available at the salad bar. Imagine my surprise when I discovered that the shredded meat was not turkey but tuna fish. God I hate tuna fish! Now I've spent the afternoon cruising for candy - - stealing bits of chocolate goodies from my co-workers - - in an attempt to eradicate the fishy taste from my mouth. Kind of defeats the purpose of a salad.  (With apologies to REO Speedwagon from whose album,  urlLink  You Can Tune a Piano But You Can't Tuna Fish   I stole my title.)

Like father, like son: not to be outdone, the Dude removed all his clothes save for his underwear.

       An Op-Ed piece from conservative columnist  urlLink David Brooks  in today’s  New York Times  reminds me that I’ve been thinking about “where I am” politically these days, and meaning to write about it:  Once it was liberals who rhapsodized about progress. Even stoic Woodrow Wilson once exulted: "Progress! No word comes more often or more naturally to the lips of modern man, as if the things it stands for were almost synonymous with life itself." But since Reagan's time, it sometimes appears that liberals and conservatives have traded places. Now Democrats often accuse Republicans of recklessness and utopianism while Republicans accuse Democrats of being the timorous defenders of the status quo. Democrats are more likely to emphasize fiscal prudence, foreign policy caution and economic security. But it's all really about American exceptionalism. Reagan embraced America as a permanent revolutionary force. His critics came to fear exactly that sort of zeal.  Brooks captures some of the internal tumult I now experience. Once active in Democratic politics, I now have no interest. Not terribly impressed with John Kerry – I preferred John Edwards optimistic, upbeat message. I find myself disenchanted with the Democrats who appear quite dour – I believe one writer recently said that John Kerry looked as if he was sucking lemons – taking our bitter medicine. On the other hand, I cannot embrace Republicans: Cheney, Rumsfeld, and Wolfowitz seem just plain mean, as do many of the party faithful. I also do not share their mistrust of Government. I see Government as an agent of “good”. It is not inherently good, but it is certainly not inherently evil. It can be slow and bureaucratic, and it can inhibit personal freedoms from time-to-time, but its role as a safety net must be preserved.  Something has changed my focus. Maybe it’s my MBA classes, or my 10 years in private business? I certainly pay more attention to business news – politics is almost like entertainment news to me.   Those in government think the world revolves around them. It certainly seems that way; given the intense media coverage they receive. But I actually think the business world has a greater impact on our well being than government. Sure government imposes taxes and regulations that impact business decisions, but nothing really drives our day-to-day lives as much as business decisions. Millions of small (and large) business decisions are made every day: Do I hire one more employee? Can I open a branch office there? Do I dare place that big order next quarter? These decisions impact expansion or contraction of business resulting in a certain quality of life – or lack thereof.

       Lately I feel that I'm walking faster. When crossing the parking lot at work, or on the path at noon, I keep passing people. I don't feel like I'm exerting any more effort. In fact, I feel more relaxed than usual. Must be that Yoga.   There he goes again, extolling the virtues of Yoga. Keep my personal history in mind: I started out as a rather inflexible kid. I fell in love with running at age 13 (8th Grade - Cross Country) and began running year round at 15. Only recently have I had to let up. By my calculations, that's 25 years of continuous running on a body that was stiff to begin with.   Yoga has loosened my whole body, particularly my hips and shoulders. Perhaps I have better motion in my legs and am using my arms to propel me when walking - - something I might not have done before?

       Heaven help me I've started listening to old-fogey radio stations. Make that AM old-fogey radio stations.   Driving home from work the other day I became bored with the FM offerings. KOOL 108 the "oldies stations" wasn't doing it for me. They have about 75 songs that they play over and over. Their play list is a little too heavy on Neil Diamond for my tastes. Cities 97 always confuses me: they will play a wonderful song (new or old) but then follow it up with Phil Collins. Cities 97 confuses me anyway. I fear I've grown out of their demographic: I can no longer tell the difference between Norah Jones, John Mayer, and the like. And the fact that they play Pearl Jam's cover of the 1950's tear-jerker  "Where, Oh' Where Can My Baby Be"  confuses me all the more. Is Pearl Jam serious, or are they making some sort of ironic statement? Doesn't matter as I never liked the song. KQRS 92.5 has it's moments, once you get past its moronic morning show. The DJs who appear through-out the remainder of the day are just fine - they actually lack personality - probably an attempt to make up for the overwhelming nature of Tom Bernard and the "Morning Crew".   Public Radio is usually my saving grace, but since it was after 6:00 p.m. my favorite KFAI 90.3 had ended it's musical programming and was in its news-hour. Interesting at times, but a bit too far to the left for my liking - Pacifica Network or something. 91.1 - KNOW - was in the middle of one of it's 10 minute spots on migrant workers or somesuch. I was lost, adrift, with nowhere to turn but AM. Good old scratchy AM. The kind of radio that fades/statics out under bridges.   After searching around the dial - lots of right wing talk and religious programming, I settled on  urlLink KLBB . The drive time show (3:00 - 7:00 p.m.) is called the "Cool Club" or some such thing. They were playing Dean Martin, Peggy Lee, Nat King Cole. You could almost hear the ice cubes clinking in the Hi-Ball glasses and smell the smoke in the lounge. Very soothing, a little heavy on the strings, but good fun nonetheless. They even have less "advertising" than Public Radio. Perhaps it's nostalgia for a bygone era. Perhaps its the fact that I grew up in a 1953 Rambler, and now own a 1958 Rambler style house. I really dig that 1950s era music. Nothing too loud, great singers singing the standards, not much "attitude" (or so it seems now - this was the era of the Rat Pack after all).   Perhaps it's just a phase I'm going through, or perhaps a phase I'm growing into? Either way, KLBB 1400 AM now has it's own button on the radio.

       James Lileks has a great piece on growing up in Fargo in the latest  urlLink American Enterprise . Here's a great quote:  You can't describe the vastness of the Panavision prairie to East Coasters. Either the idea bores them--sorry, if there's not an all-night Thai take-out every ten blocks I am so not there. Or it's incomprehensible--what, a dirt ocean that just sits there?  Yes. That's it. The earth is flat and the sky is big, and you're a small lone thing rolling between the two. True Midwesterners have no time for oceans--all that pointless motion. It comes in, it goes out. What's the point? True Midwesterners have no time for mountains. They're so obvious. They don't do anything. We have mountains, in a way; they're called clouds. And they move. Can yours do that?  My Dad would have loved that. Growing up in South Dakota, he could wax eloquently about the prairie. Once on a family vacation to the Rocky Mountains, when everyone was oohing and aahing over the scenery, he kept complaining that the mountains kept "getting in the way" of his attempts to view the scenery.

       S and I have been enjoying the new McDonald's  urlLink Go Active Happy Meals for Adults . I was very skeptical. Since I don't eat that much "junk" I figured why break tradition and go healthy at McDonald's of all places. I've tried them two times, and have been pleased each time.   Jane Brody of the NYT recently tried one of the new McDonald's salads,    For example, the other day I ordered a grilled chicken Caesar salad at McDonald's. A nicely seasoned, tender, skinless chicken breast came on a bed of crispy lettuce - iceberg and greens - and grape tomatoes with a sprinkling of grated cheese. On the side were packets of croutons and Newman's Own Creamy Caesar Dressing.  The calorie count for the salad without trimmings was 200 with 6 grams of fat. The croutons added 50 calories and 1.5 grams of fat. I used only a few dribbles of dressing - the entire packet would have added 190 calories and 18 grams of fat. Had I known ahead of time, I could have requested Newman's Own Low Fat Balsamic Dressing with only 40 calories and 3 grams of fat in the entire packet.   urlLink Link   This is personally my favorite choice, and I - like Jane - use the dressing  sparingly.   Plus - you get a "toy" - a pedometer. Last time I had to give my pedometer to Bones. He clips it to his belt and uses it for "Rescue Hero" play. Apparently it's some sort of communication device. He pops it open and talks into it. (He gets that from his Mom's side.)

       Today I had the pleasure of transporting to their various daytime activities two children, neither of whom wanted to go where they were going. Let's start with Bones. Nice morning, got to watch the Dora pirate video. He's mostly over pirates, but they still provide a laugh and a chuckle. Left the house willingly, but on the way out the door mentioned a certain story book that resides at his pre-school. Big sis remembered the story very well. The two of them discussed this story in a tone of voice reserved for the discovery of a long lost friend or toy. The story is about a girl making popcorn. The popcorn machine starts popping and it won't stop. The popcorn goes onto the floor and out the door. Very funny - - apparently. Dad wasn't paying much attention, but apperently some sort of agreement was struck. Dad and/or sis would read the story when we arrived at his school.   That's all well and good - except that this morning routine depends on some exquisitely timed drop-offs. We only have 2 to 3 minutes to say good-by to the Dude before Dad and sis head off in the other direction for the senorita's Spanish "camp" where all student must "hasta pronto" and arrive not before 8:55, but not after 9:00.    At the Dude's preschool, when it became apparent that Dad was going to do the drop and run, Dude protested and wrapped himself around Dad's legs. This slowed the old guy down, but he still hobbled to the door. Luckily "Teacher Andi" intervened, and the Dude went rather willingly into her arms - for the last time as it is her final day at school. (Another post perhaps)  20 minutes later we arrive at "Spanish Camp" (9:01 - crap) - with takes place at a suburban school - indoors - that kind of "camp". On the way in, senorita informs papa that she does not want to go - too hard - all they do is talk Spanish all day. Ah-ha, that's the point of an immersion program. It's sink or swim. Luckily for Dad she didn't wrap herself around his legs, but went willingly into the class. I think she will survive.   Hasta Luego

       Weekend at the cabin. Did a little birding with the kids (4 and 7). Tons of Orioles and various sparrows, wrens, small brown birds. One item of interest, my first  urlLink Brown Thrasher . It was acting very aggressively in a brush pile at edge of woodsy swamp area. It was making the "smacking" sound mentioned  urlLink here :    Voice  A variety of musical phrases, each repeated twice; call a sharp smack!  Perhaps we were too close to nest?   Nesting  4 or 5 pale blue, brown-dotted eggs in a large, coarsely built nest of twigs, leaves, and rootlets lined with grass. The nest is usually near the ground in a dense, often thorny bush.  That describes our situation to a "T".   Also seen: Nice soaring Bald Eagle, Hummingbirds at feeders, Swallows galore, and thousands of dragon flys. Did not see: Blue Bird, Eastern Kingbird (my favorite).

       Like this quote. It's from  Working  by Studs Terkel.    "Most of us, like the assembly line worker, have jobs that are too small for our spirit," an editor says. "Jobs are not big enough for people."   Some might find that a bit depressing, but I actually read it as a little "pick me up". Rather than letting your boredom with work get you down, just remember that most of us have jobs too small for our spirits.   (Stumbled on this quote in NYT article. It's too old to get for free, but found same article reprinted in the  urlLink Int'l Herald Tribune .)

       Word to the wise (or is that unwise): Don't run in flip-flops. Last night I joined the Dude for some running, chasing, etc. in the field behind our house. Of course I was wearing the cheapest down-market flip-flops I've ever owned. They were $2.99 at Nokomis Shoe Shop. I thought all was going well, in fact my knee didn't even hurt. Wow - running without knee pain. Perhaps I should throw out my $85 running shoes and use cheap flip-flops from now on.  No - - woke up this morning, and it  urlLink hurts here :   The cruciate crural ligament is a Y-shaped band placed in front of the ankle-joint, the stem of the Y being attached laterally to the upper surface of the calcaneus, in front of the depression for the interosseous talocalcanean ligament; it is directed medialward as a double layer, one lamina passing in front of, and the other behind, the tendons of the Peronæus tertius and Extensor digitorum longus.

       Trying to blog everyday, but looking over the day so far, can't think of much to say.  Got the day off to a good start by correctly answering the trivia question at Caribou (thus ensuring a whopping 10 cent discount on my coffee purchase).   Question: How many times had Frank Sinatra been married?  Answer: 4 times.  Here's the strategy I employed - in case you're wondering how the hell I knew the answer. I knew "Old Blue Eyes" had been married at least three times: the initial Mrs. S, mother of Nancy and Frank Jr.; Ava Gardner - the woman he left wife #1 for, a short-lived marriage; Mia Farrow - mid 1960s; and then I through another one in for good measure, figuring I really didn't know that much about Sinatra so there was bound to be at least one I was missing.   Did a little " urlLink Googling " to fill in the blanks and learned this about wife #4:  Barbara Blakely Marx divorced her husband Zeppo Marx to marry Sinatra. They wed 1976. She remained his wife until his death.

       Trying to order one book for the Father-in-Law - typical belated Father's day. As everyone knows, amazon.com waives shipping and handling fees for certain items (the new stuff essentially) if your total purchase is over $35. Figuring the book was "only" $21, I sought to add two CDs that I had heard on radio this week: Wilco and the Bottle-Rockets. What a deal right? Order one present for someone else, and get two things for ME. I did feel a little greedy.   Go to Check-Out and what - - they slapped on shipping handling fees? OK, the Bottle-Rockets CD is not new enough or popular enough, or whatever, so it doesn't qualify for waived fees. No problem, delete that item from order.  Proceed to Check-Out and, you guessed it, more shipping and handling fees. Seems that my order (minus the Bottle-Rockets) is only $34 and change. Sh*t! Now I'm faced with the choice: Do I find another qualifying item to bump me over $35 thereby saving shipping and handling, or do I eat the shipping/handling? Yes and no.  In the end, I cancelled all "my" stuff and only ordered the book. Even with the shipping/handling fee it was almost $10 off store price. So I really saved - meaning I wasn't "tricked" into buying more than I needed in order to save shipping/handling. Why spend $25 more just to save $4 shipping/handling. I know it's not the American way - too bad.   Now I feel less selfish anyway - I only bought a gift for the truly deserving father-in-law.

       Several have asked for more information on the Bill's Beach Diet. "John," they say, "All those other diets publish detailed plans directing you on what to eat - and what to avoid. Where is your plan?"   Good question, but perhaps we can re-phrase your question:  Q: Where's the beef?  A: It's on the grill.   You see, the grill, actually any sort of outdoor cooking, is the linchpin of Bill's Beach Diet. But perhaps I should lay out the Bill's Beach Diet week-by-week. Remember, if you are prone to robust fitness and energy, you may want to consult a physician before embarking on Bill's Beach Diet.    Week One   Breakfast #1:  Upon awaking, gently get out of bed, stretch, and scratch yourself if necessary. Leave the bedroom and shuffle towards the kitchen, hoping someone has already started the coffee and gone to town for the paper and pastries. The first meal of the day is the most important, you want to get off on the right foot. Start lightly, pour a cup of coffee, grab a goo-filled pastry, and proceed immediately to the couch. Don't overdo it. Just because you slept 9 hours doesn't mean you can't still be tired.   Breakfast #2:  After reading the entire paper, it's time to think about moving. Again, you may need to stretch and scratch yourself as you arise from the couch. Amble towards the kitchen to make sure there are no additional goodies to sample. Here you may want to take another pastry - but only half. Be sure to announce to all present that you really shouldn't but you are going to take only half - - if someone else wants some.   Often Breakfast #2 provides an opportunity for the first grilling of the day. Seize the moment when it presents itself. There's nothing better than the smell of Goodman's sausage smoking on the grill at 9:30 a.m. What will the neighbors think? They will probably find some excuse to stop over. Something about using your toilet as their septic tank is full - - again! Don't be fooled.   Lunch:  Lunch provides the most options for those on Bill's Beach. Here you may wish to sample any left-overs from the night before. Perhaps you went to Billy's Bar in Vergas and have some left over French-fries or hamburger (at 1/2 pound it's a biggie). Check all Styrofoam containers you find in the fridge.   Be on the lookout for fresh fruit. Perhaps the locals have procured fresh strawberries, raspberries, or blueberries. Don't overlook fresh fruit that's part of a package deal, i.e. the rhubarb dessert. Most of these contain rhubarb (kind of fruit, kind of vegetable - it grows from the ground after all), strawberries or copious amounts of sugar to cut the rhubarb's tartness, and bread products. Almost a meal in itself.   After grazing on left-overs, and sampling the frozen pizza or mac and cheese you had to make for the kids, it's time to say good-bye to lunch.  As you leave the kitchen you may want to consider getting dressed for the day. Either way, whether you are wearing fresh clothes or pj's, the hammock awaits!   Cocktail Hour:  Usually someone stops by to visit at some point in the afternoon. Now's the time to bring out the beer, wine, gin-and-tonic, chips, crackers, cheese, nuts, and anything else that's not tied down tight. Cocktail Hour can start anytime from 2:00 p.m. on, and has been known to morph into dinner.    Dinner:  Assuming your cocktail guests are still there and the sun is setting, it's time to start the grill - again. You may also want to adjourn inside as the mosquitoes are likely getting pretty fierce. When you arise from the chair (or hammock) be sure to stretch and scratch yourself. Those of you still in your pj's - - might as well keep them on, it will soon be bedtime anyway.   Dinner will consist of some grilled meat, often porkchops, chicken, sometimes hamburger, but always hotdogs and bratwurst - - children need tubular meat by-products after all, and they're great for the grown-ups too.    Dessert:  After dinner don't be afraid to hit the fresh fruit again. What goes better on ice cream than freshly picked strawberries or blueberries after all? Have you tried the rhubarb sauce yet? What? You already finished your ice cream. Let me get you a little more, you simply gotta try the rhubarb sauce.   Bed-Time Treat:  You probably haven't put the ice-cream back in the freezer after dinner. That's OK, it makes a great bed-time snack. Apply fruit as necessary.  Where has the time gone? It's time to retire for the evening. You don't feel like getting off the couch, and getting ready for bed. Don't worry - remember - you still have your pajamas on! It won't take long to brush your teeth, stretch, and scratch yourself, then collapse into bed.   Good night.

       Yoga class started last night. Nice group - and I'm not the only man! Meets at the community center, so it's a quick walk out the back door and through the park. And it had to be quick walk last night. Even with the wind, the mosquitos almost ate me alive.   I feel pretty good after a month or so of video/dvd practice, but I have one major weakness: I still can't bend from the waste that well. Rather than a standing forward bend ( urlLink Uttanasana ), I do more a slumped forward bend. Also my seated forward bend,  urlLink Paschimottanasana , is pretty lame.

       Found this cool site, "hosted" by Joop, a farmer's fox terrier from the Netherlands. Cool pictures.    My name is Joop. I'm a 'boerenfox' (farmer's fox terrier).  On August 19, 2002 I came to live with my humans in the small town of Paterswolde,  just south of the city of Groningen in the northeast of The Netherlands.  I was born in or around 1994, sais my vet.  My humans found me in an animal shelter in Noordwolde. I was brought in there by a human  who had caught me wandering near a country road.  Nothing is known about my earlier life, nothing at all.  I like to pose for the camera. My human likes to put words in my mouth. We're a good team.  If you want to look at my private album go here:  urlLink http://henkbinnendijk.tripod.com/joop/index.html    You could spend hours at this site - I haven't - but one of my favorite series of pics is entitled  urlLink Joop in de Auto .

       A colleague just e-mailed me:   So any effects on your commute inflicted by the new Choo-choo? Have you ridden it yet?  My response: Not an issue for me anymore. We now live in Roseville - which presents commuting issues of its own.  And then I kind of got carried away.  I'm not a big supporter of light rail. Now that we built it I hope it generates the ridership necessary to make it worthwhile, but I don't see how tearing up streets and putting down rail line at a cost of billions is a better transit solution that busses. One reason they got rid of the trains in the first place was because they were inflexible. If you want to try a new route, or the old route wasn't generating ridership, you couldn’t tear up the old ones or lay down new tracks easily. With buses you could try a route and if it didn’t work you could change it. Busses should be a much more flexible transit solution. In fact, up in Roseville the Metro Transit folks run small buses that carry folks around the Rosedale shopping area and down into St. Paul. Sure as hell wouldn't do that if trains were our only transit solution.   Trains hold a romantic place in many people's hearts - they recall a bygone era when many residents relied heavily on mass transit. Not everyone owned a car or needed to since most everyone lived in the cities proper and the suburbs didn't exist - at least not to the extent we see now. As the metro area grew it would have been too expensive to lay light rail out to the hinterland, but busses could work. Also more and more families purchased cars (as well as a second car) so the need to rely on public transportation was reduced.    There is another weird strain running through the whole light rail discussion. I call it "transit envy" - the notion that a train somehow makes us a "real city" like New York, Boston, Chicago, etc.  Do we need a train to make us a real city? Aren't we already a real city"? We have millions of people living in a multi-county area, an international airport; many Fortune 500 companies are located here. Don't we already have professional sports, great theater, an enlightened citizenry, relatively easy-to-navigate roads (compared to the "real cities"), plus relatively cheap parking downtown?    Don't mean to sound too negative, and I hope it works since we will be footing the bill for years to come.

       Yesterday, stiff, sore - still recovering from Monday night's yoga class. No new poses introduced, but finally learning to do the ones I thought I knew right. Videos and DVDs only take you so far. Nothing like the teacher wandering around between students offering corrections to help get your poses right. Also - when she wanders around the room we end up holding the pose for twice as long - or so it seems.   So I got a little more out of the various Warrior poses - my quads and shoulders were actually shaking. I thought that was kind of embarrassing, but at least I didn't fart. Yes, that's right. Two classes so far and each week someone farts - really loud! Considering how much twisting and squeezing we do I'm surprised I don't hear more. I reserve my "noises" for grunts and groans.   (What will the Blogspot Ads do with this post? You may notice that the ads at the top of the page relate to recent posts.

       This is the sort of thing that gets a chuckle around my work-place:    urlLink Types of Lawyers #1: The Big Firm Summer Associate  There is a certain type of lawyer who is not a lawyer at all. At best, he’s a fictional lawyer, a make-believe lawyer, a pretend lawyer. Though skilled at imitating a lawyer in dress, language, and attitude, he is no more a lawyer than the miserable sad sack who’s failed the bar exam seven times. If this type of lawyer offered legal advice to a corporate client, he would likely be sued; if he appeared in court to argue a motion, he would likely be arrested.  One of many things I have discovered in my searches throught the growing world of blawgs - legal blogs.

       What to make of  urlLink this ? Is my new favorite station ( urlLink KLBB 1440 AM ) owned really owned by MPR?   Was checking the program schedule for KLBB, 1400AM, when I stumbled upon this  urlLink site . Seems that KLBB and MPR are associated. 45 E. 7th Street being the street address of MPR in downtown St. Paul. Also the url savvy.mpr.org is sort of a giveaway.   Did a little more searching and it turns out KLBB is owned by MPR through  urlLink Greenspring .  Greenspring is a taxable for-profit company that engages in communications activities that support the mission and goals of American Public Media Group (APMG), but are more properly pursued by a taxable entity. It does so through the ownership of two operating subsidiaries: Minnesota Monthly Publications and The KLBB Company. Specifically,   The KLBB Company (KLBB)  The KLBB Company is a taxable for-profit company that engages in the operation of KLBB 1400/1470 AM in the Twin Cities on a commercial basis with an American Standards format, under license from MPR.   The KLBB Company is a wholly owned subsidiary of Greenspring.   Not that there is anything wrong with that - there isn't. But now I have another reason to feel guilty about  not  contributing to MPR. I do contribute to KFAI 90.3, and WCAL 98.3, and sometimes KBEM 88.5, the Jazz station, but not the biggie - MPR 91.1/99.5 in the TC. Guess I feel they have enough money. They don't need my nickels. If Bill Kling misses my donation to MPR, perhaps he can have Greenspring contribute the $120 (that's only $10 a month). If the contribution comes in during pledge week, he might get lucky and get a mug, or take advantage of a matching grant.

       Finally got off my butt and applied for another job in the company. I'd been toying with the idea for some time, when I got a call from my former HR manager telling me about this new opportunity. Always a good sign when someone from HR tells you about a job you might like to apply for.    I had landed in my present postion almost 2 years ago (8/2002) after being re-org'ed from another department. While I enjoy the people I work with, the actual work has become quite routine. Not only do I need more challenge, but the people I supervise/manage could do with a little more challenge as well. They deserve someone who's a little more engaged.  Of course, once I decided to leave this job, I started to see it in a new light. I'm energized, busier, looking forward to coming into this "old" job which one week ago bummed me out. Maybe if I always keep looking for work I will find my present job (whatever and wherever it is) more challenging?

       Looking forward to a long weekend at the cabin. Hope the weather is sufficiently summer-like to allow plenty of water time.   While I'm not the world's biggest  urlLink Noodle  fan - I can take them or leave them - I found this offering in their product line particularly interesting. The  urlLink Captain Noodle .    This noodle is designed with a beverage holder on each end! Whether your beverage is in a can or a bottle CAPTAIN NOODLE can hold it. The CAPTAIN NOODLE also insulates your beverage from the warm water and hot sun, keeping it cold. You will now be able to doodle around the pool or lake on CAPTAIN NOODLE and enjoy a cold refreshing beverage anytime!  Imagine that - doodle on your noodle?   Maybe I just like the name (and rank). Actually from now on when I am in or near the greater Dent area I would like all to address me as "Captain Noodle".

       Twice this week I've posted on Beatles history. Here's the last post - just for kicks. Not much happened on this day in Beatles History - in my humble opinion. But for the record:    July 9 1963  Concert at the Winter Gardens, Margate, with Billy J. Kramer with the Dakotas.    1968 Studio 3. 4.00-9.00pm. Recording: `Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da' [re-re-make].  Studio 3. 10.00pm-3.30am. Recording: `Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da' [re-make] (takes 20, 21). Recording: `Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da' (overdub onto take 13, tape reduction take 13 into take 22, overdub onto take 22); `Revolution' (rehearsal only). Producer: George Martin; Engineer: Geoff Emerick; 2nd Engineer: Richard Lush.  Recording of laughters and other bits for `Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da'.   1969  Studio 2. 2.30-10.15pm. Recording: `Maxwell's Silver Hammer' (takes 1-21). Producer: George Martin; Engineer: Phil McDonald; Engineer: John Kurlander.  1st John's session after his accident. A bed is brought into the studio so that Yoko could stay by John's side.    Thanks to  urlLink getback.org .

       Stepped out for a quick walk this afternoon. Humid - at least for me. Temp of 72, dewpoint of 62, no breeze to speak of - felt like summer for once.   Bird of the day - the  urlLink Song Sparrow .  Song Sparrows are individualists, they don't run (or rather fly) with the pack. For proof, see this cool fact:   urlLink Cool fact : Within northern populations of Song Sparrows, there may be both migratory and nonmigratory individuals. The decision to migrate is apparently an  individual choice ; it is not an inherited tendency. Once on wintering grounds, migratory birds mix with residents in loose flocks during harsh weather. (Emphasis mine)

       What's this?  urlLink  Lifestyle causes myopia, not genes .     I knew I should have played Little League baseball:   . . . children who read less also tend to spend more time outdoors, where better light may reduce the need to focus precisely for near vision. Studies show that children who play sport are less susceptible to myopia.   Carbs Involved - figures:   One group of researchers has even proposed that diet is one of the factors contributing to the rise in myopia. They argue that eating too much refined starch affects the growth of the eyeball

       In the interest of presenting both sides of the issue, thought I'd pass along this update on light-rail - which I took the opportunity to hammer  urlLink last week .    urlLink 93,000 rode the light rail in Week 1  Paying passengers boarded trains an estimated 93,000 times during the first week of Hiawatha light-rail service, topping expectations by almost 70 percent, Metro Transit reported Tuesday.

       From time to time I post on what I'm reading these days. I have a few books in the works:    urlLink  Sea of Grass   by Conrad Richter: Got this for 10 cents at the library. It was on their shelf of stuff they desperately wanted to clear out. Short historical novel published in 1936 covering the "wars" between the ranchers and settlers in old New Mexico. The inside cover has a sticker indicating the book was originally from the English Department at John F. Kennedy High School in Bloomington, MN - an old rival of my Richfield Spartans.   urlLink  Yoga Bible: The Definitive Guide to Yoga Postures  , by Christina Brown. Checked out from library, this smallish book has great illustrations of almost every posture you can think of along with practical tips for your practice. I believe there are 170+ postures - - including those really gross stomach pulling ones, the  urlLink Nauli  poses.   urlLink  Beans: Four Principles for Running a Business in Good Times or Bad,   by Leslie Yerkes and Charles Decker. Found this one at the company library. It is a business "fable" - a fictionalized account of a Seattle coffee shop owner and his struggles to reinvigorate his small coffee shop.

       Not that I doubted it, but here's further evidence of the benefits of the bean - from today's  urlLink Chicago Tribune :  Though the virtues of coffee drinking may have been debated in the past, now there appear to be new reasons to rejoice over java. More and more studies have linked coffee consumption to a number of health benefits, including a reduced risk of diabetes, Parkinson's disease, gallstones, colon cancer and potentially heart disease.

       July 6, 1957 - an important day in my life - though it would be 5 years more before I was born.   On this day in 1957, 15 year old Paul McCartney of Liverpool, England and his pal Ivan Vaughn went to a church fete in the Liverpool suburb of Woolton. Legend has it Paul and Ivan went to the party for two reasons: girls and to hear a band. Ivan's friend John Lennon (age 16) had a band called the Quarrymen who played that day.  Long story short - Paul hears John massacre the words to "Come Go With Me", Ivan introduces his mutual friends during a break. After the show, Paul teaches John the correct words to the song, then teaches the Quarrymen to play "Twenty Flight Rock" (by Albert Lea native Eddie Cochrane), and to top it all off, shows John how to tune a guitar.   Some say that John asked Paul to join the Quarrymen that very day, other sources say it was a few days later. Either way, within the month, the seed germinated and the Beatles were born.  What about Ivan? I suspose he is one of many who earned the title "Fifth Beatle". I was able to dig this up  urlLink online . These are Paul's comments during an April 30, 2001 interview with Terry Gross on  urlLink Fresh Air .:   " Well, Ivan Vaughn was one of my best friends at school, who was born on exactly the same day as I was in Liverpool. So when we discovered this fact in the playground chatting, we became instant good mates. And he was a really lovely man. He turned out to be a classic scholar. He went to Cambridge to study Greek and Latin. And the other important thing was that he actually introduced me, one day, to John Lennon because he was very good friends with John, part of John's crowd. And Ivan said to me, 'Come along to this village fair.' That was in the village of Walton where John and Ivan lived. And he said, 'Why don't you come along? It'll be quite a bit of fun,' you know. He said, 'And my friend's playing in one of the bands.' So I arrived there and saw John, and so I was introduced. So it was Ivan who actually introduced me to him.

       Figured out my blog problems almost by myself. Was able to do a short test blog with no problem, but anything longer (that inlcuded block quotes and links) just kept coming out all messy. Also - - when I tried to post I kept getting error messages saying either my&nbsp; div  was not closed, or my  div  had not been opened.   After trying unsuccessfully to&nbsp;either close the  div  by adding div or open the unclosed  div  by typing&nbsp;div I gave up and went to the Blogspot help site. Saw that one user had commented that his editor was adding  div  tags where it shouldn't have. He just deleted his  div  tags and viola - perfect.   Aha - - I didn't even know the  div  tags shouldn't be there. I went back, deleted the div tags, and I'm up and running.   Almost as satisfying as replacing the toilet (I love plumbing!).

        urlLink This day in 1969  found the Beatles at Abbey Road studios working on a couple of George compositions: Here Comes the Sun and Something.   Studio 3. 2.30-7.00pm. Recording: `Here Comes The Sun' (overdub onto take 15).. Studio 2. 7.00pm-12.30am. Recording: `Something' (overdub onto take 36, tape reduction into takes 38, 39). Producer: George Martin; Engineer: Phil McDonald; 2nd Engineer: Alan Parsons.  Note 2nd Engineer  urlLink Alan Parsons  - - as in "The Alan Parsons Project".&nbsp; Very interesting career. I knew he had worked for the Beatles but wasn't aware of all his other stuff:   This was only the beginning however; As the engineering mastermind behind Pink Floyd's "Dark Side of the Moon" album, Alan became highly sought after as one of the new breed of creative engineers.&nbsp;

        urlLink New York Times  reports on the decline of the American middle-distance runner.   It has been 32 years since an American man has won an Olympic gold medal in a middle-distance track event. The American record in the mile, 3 minutes 47.69 seconds by Steve Scott, has stood for 22 years. In the middle distances, defined as the 800 meters and the 1,500 meters, there has not been an American man ranked No. 1 in the world since 1980. In the last 20 years, fewer than a dozen Americans have cracked the world's top five at either distance.       Similar problems at the Marathon level. Here's what just one writer/runner ( urlLink Lee Fidler in Running Journal ) has to say:&nbsp; When looking at Track and Field News recently, I discovered that my best marathon times from 1975-1980 would have ranked me higher in 2003 than they did when I ran them. Wouldn't you assume that performances would improve over time?   In 2003 the top American times wer 2:10:03, 2:12:47, and 2:12:51. In 1983 three U.S. citizens broke 2:10 in one race, and another went under in December. My best time (2:15:04) ranked 30th in 1980. Last year, it would have ranked fifth.     Fidler implies that maybe present-day marathoners are not working hard enough:   During the period from 1972 thorugh 1983, I averaged 100 miles per week, and it seems most of my contemporaries logged a similar volume. We may have run well in spite of our training instead of because of it, but there seems to be some positive correlation between high mileage and marathon success. My suggestions for the elite may be a good take-home message for anyone who hopes to run or race marathons.   Some blame money. Runners in the 1970s (Shorter and Rodgers, etc) were amatuers (OK so they got shoe and clothing deals) but they didn't make a living off race winnings. Rules prohibited winning much more than a cheap medal. Today, many races offer prize money. My brother, no slouch at the running game, once speculated that many great runners were gravitating to the shorter road races. Shorter distances mean quicker recovery which means more chances to make money.  &nbsp;  What to do?    Some have called for American-only events. The Twin Cities marathon announced this tactic for the upcoming October 2004 event, but later changed their mind after Minneapolis civil rights officials began to condier legal action.   I tend to favor a return to more miles. You can't take the money out of the sport, and you shouldn't. Like most sports, most athletes only have a few good years. I don't begrudge them the chance to make a living (at least a chance to support themselves while they are training sometimes twice a day for many hours).   In the end, marathoners will have to want it bad enough. It's a big risk. You train for months, and it can take months to recover from each race. The runner only has&nbsp;a few good marathons "in them" each year. Will someone take that course over running (and making money) in shorter races several times a month?&nbsp;

       I just started  urlLink Zero Three Bravo: Solo Across America in a Small Plane , by Mariana Gosnell. Found this one on Tuesday at the Library's "remainder shelf". At the library's exit there are usually two or three carts of books you can take, provided you leave a donation: $1 for hardcovers and 50 cents for paperbacks.   This book may be put to further use. I figure it  urlLink Ogren  might be interested, flight freak that she is. Assuming she hasn't read it already.  This book will have an interesting life. It is marked as coming from Hennepin County, I bought it at the Ramsey County Library and may end up in Iowa.

       I've been reading this fascinating business blog called  urlLink Management by Baseball . Those familiar with my disinterest in baseball and other sports might take this as a sign that this blog is worth checking out.   The blogger just finished a three-part series on "The Book" - the unwritten rules of baseball, comparing them to the unwritten rules of business/life.    "By The Book", a platitude you hear in organizations whose size or industry has shorn them of their entrepreneurial vitality, comes from baseball. But in moving from baseball to other organizations, especially business ones, the model has unnecessarily lost a lot of its intrinsic value. Non-baseball organizations should examine "The Book" baseball keeps for guidelines on how to proliferate policy, how to diffuse it though their organization so people understand it and how to see that it evolves appropriately over time.  . . .  Baseball "knows" and makes it easy to see how procedures should evolve because managers pay close attention both to the immediate & to with trends they've been tracking, synthesizing them. Take a couple of well-known managers as an illustration . . .   It pays to create ways to diffuse knowledge through your organization without resorting to procedures manuals, and baseball is the shining example of why to do it, how to do it, and when and how to break the mold for decisions.   urlLink link

       Coffee can have this effect:  It isn't all fun and games. "After about four stores, the coffee loses all taste," says Winter, who's unconcerned about any long-term effects of so much coffee. "It doesn't taste good at all—I'm not enjoying drinking it. After an extreme number of stores, I have to wash out the taste with water after every sip because it's starting to make me sick."    urlLink Fortune  reports on a man attempting to visit every Starbucks:  There is no stopping Starbucks' worldwide expansion.

        urlLink Phillip Greenspun  wonders if High School is a thing of the past:   Suppose that you had a 16-year-old named Johnnie and the $14,000 per year that the local school district will spend to keep him occupied for a year. If there were no Boeing 747s, cheap telephones, or Internet you might want to send him to a nearby school. But for less than $2000 we can send that kid anywhere in the world and bring him back for Christmas and Spring Break. For a few cents per minute we can pick up the phone and talk to our kid regardless of where he happens to be.   Hmm... maybe we can send Johnnie to China for one year. He will go to an elite private boarding school and learn Mandarin, probably the most useful language for business, aside from English, for the foreseeable future. With the money left over from the $14,000 after subtracting for airfare and school fees we can send Johnnie on a backpacking tour around Australia during his summer break.   I've often wondered about the value of traditional Junior High (grades 6 - 8 or 7 -9), but haven't given much thought to the high school question. My mother attended a one-room school house as a young child. She found the mixing of the grades very helpful - she would usually sit and listen in on the lessons intended for the upper grades.

       I usually don't put much faith in "signs". You know, looking for guidance in the form of hints from above/below/or beyond. However, when I stumble across two references to the importance of poetry in less than 24 hours - well you gotta stop and take notice.   Yesterday I came upon   urlLink Scrolling Forward, Making Sense of Documents in the Digital Age   by David M. Levy.   For Levy, documents-from cash register receipts to children's notes, greeting cards, and web pages-are "things we have imbued with the ability to speak." While each kind of document operates within its own limited niche, collectively they work to provide some measure of stable ground in an unstable world.  I starting reading Levy's chapter on Whitman's "Leaves of Grass", and remembered I had purchased a book of Whitman's poetry years ago. It inspired me to go find it - - haven't located it yet. (Hope I didn't give it away - I do things like that.)   Today, one of my favorite blogs,  urlLink About Last Night , has a piece on the benefits of good, old-fashioned rote memorization of poetry. I have taken these two "hints" as a sign that I should memorize a poem. Wish me luck!

       It was so hot today.  How hot was it?  It was so hot that my shins sweated, leaving sweat stains on the lower front of my khakis.   Conditions as of 11:00 a.m.  Minneapolis, Minnesota  Currently: 84°F Partly Cloudy  Wind: Southwest at 6.0 MPH  Humidity: 69.0%  Dewpoint: 73°F  Barometer: 29.83 inches and rising  Heat Index: 90°F   Today is one of those days where it truly is the  humidity  and not the  heat . Just returned from a very slow walk – 1.2 miles around the path. Everything seemed slow and muffled, thick. The birds, however, were very active, especially the goldfinches. Observed many bright males chasing each other, rising up then diving down. Perhaps the abundance of thistle makes them so active. I believe the variety is  urlLink plumeless thistle .  &nbsp; Yoga practice going well, after a brieft setback. At the end of last week, I was very stiff. My right shoulder was giving me trouble, along with my right hip and calf. I tried to "yoga" my way out of it, by being diligent about my poses, and doing lots of them as well. Not a good idea. &nbsp; Somewhere around midday Sunday, probably when I was having trouble reaching up to change the CD volume whilst driving, I had a revelation. Breathing - I hadn't been breathing correctly. Moreover, I wasn't practicing any relaxation&nbsp;in my yoga.&nbsp; I was just forcing all the poses and starting to feel all bound-up in the shoulders, back, and hip. At first I welcomed this sensation. Felt kind of muscle-bound - a real Charles Atlas, ready to kick sand in someone's face. But then I remembered the funny thing about yoga, like much of life. If you try to hard you often&nbsp;run into trouble. Just step back and approach it&nbsp;in a more relaxed state. &nbsp; Solution - - the AM/PM Yoga&nbsp;DVD. I had been ignoring it for a while because it is so touchy-feely. The music is all swarmy and new-agey. But&nbsp;I also remembered that it really promotes the breathing, relaxation part of the practice, while moving through some wicked tough poses.&nbsp;On Sunday night I&nbsp;slipped old Patricia Walden in the DVD player and did the PM workout. On Monday I did both&nbsp;AM (Rodney Yee) and later PM. Did the AM again this morning. Feel great! &nbsp; Learning&nbsp;yoga&nbsp;is kind of overwhelming.&nbsp;Like another sport I know, it promises to cure all ills, even change&nbsp;the way you live and think. There are so many poses, it's tempting to try them all and really push yourself. Not a good idea. Moderation, of course, is the key to success. The harder you push, the further into injury you go. It&nbsp;almost sounds backward, but it works: Strength through relaxation and flexibility. &nbsp;

       Many ask me how I became interested (obsessed?) with the Beatles. I tell them it was the "Silver Album",   urlLink Beatles Rock-n-Roll Music  , released June 10, 1976.  &nbsp;  This  urlLink review  paints a rather grim potrait of the album I loved so much:   Once The Beatles contract with E.M.I. expired on February 6th 1976, E.M.I. had the rights to release any of The Beatles previously released recordings. This double set was the first album release where E.M.I. exerted that total control.  &nbsp;  ***  As with the "Red" and "Blue" albums, the presentation of this package was once again diabolical. The artwork was awful, no "special" tracks, no lyrics, no coloured bags, nothing. In fact, John had actually written to E.M.I. offering a design, and was not at all impressed with E.M.I.'s refusal and the finished product. The art direction was by Roy Kohara, and the amateurish drawings were by Ignacio Gomez.   Unfortunately, nothing new on the album, every track had been previously released, although the four "Long Tall Sally" E.P. tracks and "I'm Down" were in stereo and on an album in the U.K. for the first time.   One point of interest ... for the first time an L.P. of The Beatles had an entire side NOT written by them. In fact, if you include the two tracks of the previous side, and the first of the next ... a most unusual TEN tracks in a row ALL non-Beatles written!    It's impossible to imagine a time when I didn't know these songs, but there was. Prior to this album I think I would have recognized  She Loves You  - mostly for its Yeah, Yeah, Yeahs;  Hey Jude  - probably because it was so darn long, and maybe  Yellow Submarine . At the tender age of 14, I fell in love with this album, playing it over and over. Side one of the first album was my favorite:  Twist and Shout ,  I Saw Her Standing There ,  You Can't Do That ,  I Call Your Name  . . .&nbsp; I remember staring at the album drawings and trying to guess who was who. Ringo was easy, the guy holding the sticks, but I had no idea who was John, Paul, or George. Early on I figured out Paul, but couldn't understand why his bass looked like a violin. It took me months to get John and George straightened. Now I can pick apart any song, tell you who sings what part, who plays what instrument. Thanks to guitar lessons and a heightened understanding of that instrument, I am even beginning to pick out which guitar solos are by George, and which are by John and sometimes even Paul - - George did always get to play lead.  &nbsp;  Incidentally, this day in Beatle History, on July 19, 1976,  Rock-n-Roll Music  was released in the UK. Not often that a Beatles album was released in US before UK.

       Haven't said much if anything about the guitar lately. Took it up last year - part of the ongoing mid-life crisis. If anything it helps me appreciate music more. When you play it yourself - or in my case, try to play it - you understand a little better when you hear others play it. Even Top-40 stuff sounds more interesting.   Along those lines I found this today,   Though I think I would have always dug this band, [The Kings of Leon - ed.]these days I find I can really hear them,. I am aware of each note; I can feel the separation of the instruments; sense what Caleb and Matthew Followill are doing on their guitars; take it all apart and put it back together; and it’s all due to the few months Jack and I have spend whacking our own geetars.  Over the past couple of years, drawing has done the same for my appreciation for art, focusing my likes but quelling my dislikes, broadening my mind and letting me see what I would have formerly walked past or dismissed. I feel increasingly less intimidated by the heavy intellectualism of a lot of contemporary art and get a lot more pleasure whenever I’m in a museum.    You don’t have to be a musician to love music or an artist to love art or a writer to enjoy a novel, but when you try to make it yourself, even in the most rudimentary way, it enhances what you get out of really great Art. In the end, we are all Artists. Some of us have long hair, greasy fu-manchus, and peg leg jeans while others just back up nine-year-olds .(emphasis mine)    urlLink Everyday Matters .

       Coming down with something - throat is sore and scratchy. I have various aches and pains.   To help me forget the pain I'm perusing some cool blogs.   urlLink Althouse : by Ann Althouse a University of Wisconsin, Madison, Law Professor. Been reading this one for a while. In addition to the political/legal spin, I like her pictures of Madison. I once thought the day would never come when I didn't know anyone in Madison. Seemed for a while that we knew a half-dozen friends or family in grad school at Madison, making the frequent road trip down 94 to visit. Those days are gone.   urlLink iamtonyang : This is by a man named Tony Ang - I think. Life of a young technie in Boston. Great pictures every day. Neat street scenes along with very cool nature pics. He doesn't miss much.  Just found this  urlLink maps  site today. Very cool hand-drawn maps.

       Somehow my  urlLink AM morning  practice with Rodney Yee will never bee the same.  Sadly, commercialization breeds excess. Take Rodney Yee, one of America's top yoga instructors. He once preached that yoga helped him achieve a solid marriage. That was before Time named him the "stud muffin" of yoga in 2001 and a former teacher at his Oakland, Calif., studio hit him with a breach-of-contract lawsuit after two students alleged they had sexual relationships with him. (Yee has denied the claims.)   Wendy Melillo,  Ohm no! A commercial pose is the last thing yoga needs , ADWEEK Western Edition, Copyright BPI Communications Inc., 2003. Sorry, link not available.

       Interesting piece in the  urlLink Business Pundit  about  urlLink Abusing Time .   Time abuse is very different from the common and well-covered problem of time management. While the vast majority of us can benefit from practical insights on how to organize our lives better, lessons in time management will have little impact on time abusers. That's because real time abuse results from psychological conflict that neither a workshop nor a manager's cajoling can easily cure. Indeed, the time abuser's quarrel isn't even with time but rather with a brittle self-esteem and an unconscious fear of being evaluated and found wanting. That's why you should focus your efforts on what makes a time abuser anxious instead of teaching him how to organize his day.  Not sure if blogging at work is an abuse of time. Not sure what sort of schedule the BP keeps but I see blog entry was posted at 9:19 a.m. and people who comment do so during business hours. Although reading a business site at work beats checking the latest sports scores or worse.

       Given number of old musty&nbsp;Archie comics at the in-laws cabin, I couldn't resist passing this along,   Archie Comics produced a wide variety of terrible comics in addition to the stuff they did well. And I do think they did some stuff well.     urlLink Read the whole sad thing.

       Looking back on the summer of 1966, when it appeared the Beatles were bigger than Jesus - or more popular - or something. Here's what John Lennon actually said. Sometimes it pays to read the quote in context - - sometimes is doesn't.    "Christianity will go. It will vanish and shrink. I needn't argue about that. I'm right and will be proved right. We're more popular than Jesus now; I don't know which will go first, rock 'n' roll or Christianity. Jesus was all right, but his disciples were thick and ordinary. It's them twisting it that ruins it for me.  - John Lennon, 1966 (This quote sparked quite a large controversy, as many of you might know)   "Look, I wasn't saying the Beatles are better than God or Jesus. I said 'Beatles' because it's easy for me to talk about Beatles. I could have said TV or the cinema, motor cars or anything popular and I would have gotten away with it."  - John Lennon, 1966   "No I wouldn't say that at all."  - John Lennon, 1966, in response to the question "Do you feel you are being cruicified?"  urlLink Steve's Beatle Page   This day in Beatles history, Aug. 6, 1966:  Brian [Epstein - Beatles manager] leaves his holidays at the village of Portmeirion, North Wales, to fly to New York and give a televised press conference defending Lennon in the `Bigger than Jesus' controversy.

       Stumbled upon a cool list. don't ask me how, I'm often unsure how I end up at these sights.  urlLink Six Things You Don't Know About:  Minnesota .  #1 Minnesota is Trannie Town:   Things seemed to going well that night at the bar. That tall, svelte gal flirting with you has just invited you home. Seems like it's your night until calloused man hands caress you and that Adam's apple suddenly just pops out. This happens a lot in our state. It's estimated that The Center for Sexual Health at the University of Minnesota (Go U!) does more than half the surgeries nationwide and plenty stick around our Twin Cities.   #5. We Prefer Our Fish With Poison, You Know, For Flavor.    Madison, Minn. has the unenviable distinction of being the "Lutefisk capital of the United States". Made from codfish, this is a Scandanavian delicacy which literally means "fish soaked in plutonium". However, the Norwegian immigrant's found an easier away of preserving their codfish was to soak it in lye. Yep. Fucking lye.

       Well - not really "house" - though lord knows that could use some cleaning. Just finished cleaning up my IE Favorites, dumping all the blogs that I no longer visit on a regular basis, or ones that I frequently visit despite the fact that they often annoy me. The latter are like a bad habit, akin to picking a scab. Once upon a time I found a "gem" on the site, saved it as a Favorite, then returned every day hoping for a similar gem, only to be disappointed. [Better watch where I go with this - people in glass houses, etc.]  Anyway, cleaned up my Favorites and I'm now looking for more.
