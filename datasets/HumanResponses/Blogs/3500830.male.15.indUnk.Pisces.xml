            Wow! School is almost over. THANK GOD! Today was so boring... we aren't learning anything anymore (wait... we never did). In French for an hour and 45 minutes we cut out pictures from French Magazines and wrote parapgraphs on what we thought about there clothes, in French. How educational. Algebra... I must say it was interesting... Mrs. BJ talked about how she almost cut her ex-husbands girlfriend's hair off. However, I now have decided Mrs. BJ is a psycho path! Then creative writing... we played "Ask Mr. Useltoon Any Question You Want" the whole class. It was... different. Then Health... well that is that. I'm super excited about Who's Line tonight... me and Charisse are going to see it! Yay! Ugh... but yeah... speaking of which I better go get ready!

      Another Wednesday that I missed church because of Cheerleading. This is getting to be ridicilous! I've missed the last several Sunday and Wednesday nights because of it. But, well I knew it was going to happen when I started cheering. I just wish I could do both. I go to church every Sunday morning though. Darn, I wish I could go on a missions trip and help some little kids out. That would be so awsome. I was just reading in my devotions the other day about this guy that went on one and he gave these kids a rubberband and they were so excited. They thought it was the coolest things on earth! That's so awsome. But it's also sad that a lot of kids here would just be like "Oh a rubberband, woo hoo." We are just so lucky and we take it for granted, and i'm guilty of it also! :;sighs:;. But anyways. I slept late today, until 11:30. Then I got up and like brushed my teeth etc... and went out to the pool. I layed out a long time today and just swam a little bit, cuz the water was freezing. But i'm getting pretty tanned up, so that's good. I'll be ready for the beach. But who will I take with me? ::strokes chin in a profound way::. Then I came in and like took a nap, cuz I was tired for some reason. Then me and my mom went out to eat (My Dad and Sister are out of town until Sunday, that's so friggan awsome... I can't stand them.) Then, my mom took me to tumbling. I was so dissapointed to see my French Teacher pulling out of the parking lot w/ her daughter (a gymnast) just as we pulled in. I want to talk to her, she was awsome, like the over all best teacher I ever had. Yeah, i'm a loser, I miss school. Then I came home and just hung out. I haven't had my devotions yet though, but that's where i'm headin so... peace out!

      (Okay, so I think that tittle was super cheesy, but oh well) So today, I got up at 9:30 my aunt calls at 10ish for me to baby-sit from from 12-5. Okay, sounds good. I need the cash. She gets here early, for once, like by and hour and then so like I feed her kids and we go swimming (I lay in the sun). Then, we came in and ate again around 2:30ish and watched an old James Bond movie (Diamonds Are Forever). Then there mom came at like 4, kind of early. But then she stayed at my house until like 5:30. It was kind of silly. Then I went to my mom's softball game. It was way boring so I walked over to the hospital (They have an awsome coffe shop). And got me a Frozen White Chocolate Mocha Latte and a huge, delicious Chocolate Chip Cookie (it was like a half inch thick and like super round, and goey!)... gosh no wonder i'm so fat! But it was way good. Then I went to tumbling. Not to toot my own horn but ::beep:: ::beep::, j/k. But, I did pretty good tonight. I was like grabbing my knees and all. It was fun. Then I came home took a bath, devoted myself, and then I got online, where I am now. LoL. And i'm way missing that awsome kid whom I like so much. Ahh, they will be back Saturday. Can't wait!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Well, i'm outta here, au revoir!

      Well, yeah... i'm totally missing them. Saturday is to far away. But, oh well. I shall be patient. I'm just going crazy! Ugh, yeah. But anyways. I got up pretty early today, but then I went back to sleep on the couch. Then I woke up and gave Kent (my dog [he's so cute]) a bath. That was grose. I hate giving him a bath, it's nasty. But he needed it. Then... I had to clean the bathroom in which I gave him a bath in. Which is really the only bath tub we have, so I didn't have a choice in the matter of which bath tub. Because were dead broke and our house is a peice of crap with a capitol C. Then... I went swimming and layed out in the sun, or attepted to. STUPID CLOUDS. How am I going to get a tan, with all these stupid Cirro Nimbus clouds?!?!?! J/K I doubt they were that kind of cloud. But, maybe... if so that sure would impress Mrs. Johnston (the #1 Earth Science teacher in the world, you rocked!). It's sad to say but I miss school. So then anyways, I got a shower and went to cheerleading practice (officially open gym, but well, same ole same ole). We really didn't do anything there. I don't see how were gonna win state with the lazy squad we have this year. Afterwards our camp clothes came in so we had to pick those up. I was mad cuz 1 of my t-shirts was back ordered and my new Uniform top didn't come in. I got the shorts to match the t-shirt and the pants to match the uniform top, but t-shirt/top. However, I had to leave my stuff at school cuz no one was there to pick me up so I ran home and I couldn't carry that crap and run at the same time. I could had walked and carried it... but then I would look stupid. So I ran, which was good for me. I'll just pick my camp crap up next week. But seeing how no one was there to pick me, the reson was cuz my rents thought it ended at 8. But if I had a cell phone I could had called them and been like no, it ends at 7:30. But I don't have a cell phone so I couldn't. Maybe now, they will see how important it is for me to have one. I could had gotten ran over running down that busy rode. But I didn't and now i'm here, lol. But i'm gonna bounce. TTYL!

      I didn't "blab" (lol, Matt) in this thing yesterday. I was to tired last night. I don't know why, though. Well I didn't sleep very much over the weekend, that's probably it. So I went to church yesterday morning. That was fun. Then I came home and was just sort of lazy. Then I had cheerleading practice. That was... pretty good. It'd be better if everyone decided to show up. Well they just better when we learn our competition routine. Then I came home and ate dinner and watched the US Olympic trials for women's gymnastics. Those chicks are amazing! There, like 1,000x better tumblers than i'll ever be. Yeah then I went to bed, I was beat. Well so that was my day! L8er!

      I miss them! But i'm gonna have to deal with it until Saturday. Anyways, so today I wake up at quarter to 7 (just whack for a Saturday morning). We left for tumbling and stopped and has buscuits then I was tumbling by 9. I did very, very, very suprisingly good today. I was so excited. My standing tumbling was all like, awsome (not to be aragont). I got to start twisiting/fulling again. I started once before but Lisa (my istructor) said I was unsafe before, but now I have things worked out. So that was fun. It's gonna be really hard to catch on to though! Oh and I was so excited! Courtney showed up and brought a friend Pamela. Meghan, Alisha, and Amber still didn't show. But oh well. After tumbling me and my mom went over to Moyer Complex to watch my sister's softball tournament (I HATE THOSE THINGS!). We watched two games back to back it was so hot. I have weird tan lines now because of what I was wearing and the sun was all hot. Then they had a big break inbetween games. So me and my mom went to the mall and I got a cool like button up shirt with these awsome, almost pearly-ish buttons (but not like feminin pearls). And I got some orange and blue swim trunks. There awsome, they match these cute orange flip-flops I bought especilly to wear with the shirt I wore to "Little Shop of Horrors". And it was the only shirt that matched them, so now I have a shirt and swimtrunks to match. But I can't wear the shirt with the swim trunks, they don't match. So then... we ate lunch at this chicken place and went back to the tournament. And going back I found out that theres like 4 lesbos on my sisters softball team. My sister was freaking out because they all had there girlfriends there and they were all over each other. But well, oh well. It doesn't bother me. Then we ate at like Ragazzi's or something. I can't spell. It was good. I saw my tumbling coach for school there with her family. It was fun. Except her neice Morgan whom is in my grade was with her and she's like really mean. I can't stand her! But oh well... i'm nice to her face. Then I came home and took a bath and had my devotions and wrote this post. I'm heading to bed now though, cuz i'm super beat. Salut!

      They left, for there Mission Trip today! That's so cool that they got to go on one! And well me I was super lazy today. I didn't do anything. Until tonight, I went to the Mall with this awsome chick, Tiffany. She rocks! She was visiting from out of town... it was so much fun. Or well I had fun, I hope she did. I didn't buy anything though. That was a first for me going to the mall not buying anything. I saw this awsome hot pink shirt at Hot Topic but it said Finch and Finch is a band and I didn't know if they were bad so I didn't buy it. But then I came home and talked to Charisse about it and she said they were good. So I might buy it. Well I bought my dinner. I had a Mocha Late and A Rasberry (or maybe it was Cranberry) scone with a white chocolate filling. Oh, and I bought me some Jelly Beans and her some Runts, it was fun. Well and now i'm home. So talk to me online, or something. L8er! Oh and I miss them already, ::sighs::.

      (tittle continued) BOYRFRIEND!!!!!!!! (sorry that wouldn't fit in the tittle box)   That's right! My sister she's so... gosh... i'd fill up to whole page if I used all the adjectives there are to describe her lazy/self-centered/even more self-centered/disgusting/etc... self! I can't stand her. And if she thinks for one minute she's gonna bring a kid home. NO! HECK NO! And she better not go to the beach with us this year, your 18 honey, get a life... you've sure ruined mine enough! Anyways. I baby-sat today. It wasn't fun, but hey I got paid $50... so that was nice. Well that was for two days of baby-sitting, but it's still good. And like all day pretty much the kids just swam while I layed out in the sun, so nothing was really abnormal other than them yelling incesintly. So then one of the kids left then like a couple hours later the other one left, even though there brother and sister. Then... I went running with my mom. I did pretty good, for me, I think. I ran a little over 3.5 miles. Then I walked like 3ish miles. Then she wanted go to the tanning bed so I went with her even though I layed out all day. I still tanned 20 minutes there. But just a little advice to well, men I guess, but if you use the like tanning lotion that like makes you tingle keep it off your, your, umm... your... ::whispers:: balls. It's not a fun experience. But anyways I got tan. Then I came home and ate a late dinner, took a bath, had my devotions, and here I am. So that was my day, i'm pretty tired, it was kind of a big day. AND I dind't get to talk to WDD... there leaving tomorrow for a missions trip from tomorrow (Friday) until NEXT Saturday... i'm gonna miss them. I wish I could talk to them right now but I can't. But oh well.. 1 Corinthians 13 (the patience part... even though I should seriously be thinking about the jealousy etc... parts also). OMG... (Oh My Gosh)... Tomorrow night i'm going to meet Tiffany at the mall. I can't wait, it's been ages since i've seen her. It's gonna be so much fun. But I need to save my money for the beach and the weekend after August 17th... so I probably won't buy much, but just seeing her will way rock! Well I better go, l8er!

      Well... los huevos is Spanish... i'm in French, but well don't ask. Anyways... today, for the morning I was super lazy. I just cleaned house a little bit and watched tv. Then at like 2ish Danielle came over! That was super fun. We watched Kill Bill Vol. 1. We'd both already seen it but it's okay. It's a great movie. Haha, and during the movie the phone rang so I paused it and answered the phone. (I paused it at the seen like where Lucy [I think her code name was ?Cottonmouth?] anyways she was at that table and about to cut the dudes head off and I knew she was getting ready to yell in Japanese) It was a sales person for MCI on the phone and they said "May I speak to Dallas Nolen, please?" So I said, "hold on one second please?" and un paused the movie and held the phone up to it while Lucy yelled in Japanese then I hung up. It was hilarious, but I guess you would have to be there. DUDE, I WANNA SEE KILL BILL VOL. 2!!! So then... ummm i'm not supposed to say, lol. But Danielle taught me how to dance, so we can hit it up in the clubs at the beach! Umm... then we ate dinner and watched Clueless. We didn't get to finish though because I had to leave for tumbling. She went with me. Hehe I felt like a dork, tumbling in front of her. But she's way super cool. Although, I tumbled like crap tonight! I sucked! Last night was good though, I don't know what happened tonight. I might had just been tired. So then... we dropped her off and I came home and here I am. Yeah, lol. So I guess... i'm gonna go chat with some people, lol. L8er! Au Revoir!

      HaHa... that was what someone's buddy sound was at like 2 o-clock this morning, So at 2 I was like cracking up over it. I don't know why it's not that funny, I think it was just the way the guy said it. And hey 2 in the morning, anything funny. Yeah then I got up at 8:30... pretty impressive or well early for me on summer break! Then I was like totally lazy, didn't do a darn thing! I talked to some awsome kid in Lynchburg on the phone! It was great. And I'm talking to that same kid now, it's awsome. I like them so much! Yeah so after I talked on the phone... I went swimming for just a few minutes. I felt like I needed to do a few laps to make me not feel so... fat/stationary. Then I ate some grub and got way over dressed to go to my mom's softball game. But oh well, I needed a good dress up, cuz I haven't since school's been out. Then I went tumbling. I did awsome there! I was so suprised with myself. Lisa said now that I have my layout all fixed i'm Definitly gonna start twisting! I can't wait! I hope I do okay and don't like blow my knee out. Yeah... so now that awsome Kid is gone so i'm gonna bounce also! TTYL!

      Sunday morning, I went to church. It was great! Pastor Mark (the Youth Pastor) did the message cuz Pastor Andy (the really real Pastor) was out of town for Father's Day. Ensuite (then), I came home and cleaned, went swimming, came in the house and got ready for practice. CHEELEADING PRACTICE... AHHH! So I get there... and 9 of the kids are gone. Like, what the crap? Ugh so the REMAINDER of us practiced. It was pretty rough. We learned this new stunt it was like a pyramid called "The Roach". It was pretty easy to do, but I thought it looked sloppy. But the coaches loved it, so oh well. Then we danced, then we tumbled, THEN they decided the guys needed to partner stunt! So Lewis got Ashley Creasy (1 of the three flyers actually there) they were a good match. Then theres me and Connor left and 2 flyers. Flyer 1 is short and super chunky (NO OFFENSE LEAH!) and Flyer 2 is tall and hippy (NO OFFENSE RONI!!!) so I get stuck with Flyer 2 and Connor gets Flyer 1. So she's like taller than me... and heavy. I got her up... oh yeah she got up there (with an assist) but getting her back down. That's different. Coach Jessica was like just flick her so I do and she just like falls and crashes down on my head/chest and were both on the ground. It sucked! And then on the Sore Monday... my back hurts! Like it's hurt all day. I woke up early like 8 and felt like crap so just rolled over and went back to sleep. I finally got up at 11. I did like nothing though. I got around to calling Danielle that was fun. Then... I had cheerleading "open gym" for the school but like 10 people showed up. So we did nothing! Absolutely nothing! Came home, ate, went to sleep, and here I am. LoL. But yeah, so well... yeah. I'm gonna go now, go and talk to some peeps, haha. L8er!

      Wait, that's right the three of you didn't show up. Ya'll just kind of left me hanging! But oh well... atleast I got some one on one time with Lisa. It's okay really though... we just paid the whole cost... "all our money right down the crappa woooooosh just gone!" Nah but don't sweat it just be there next week, please. I did pretty well today, though. Yeah... so then like after tumbling me and ma mère went over to the mall (au centra commercial)... but it was Tanglewood Mall so it way sucked! It does have TJ Max though... they have awsome housewares (if there not scratched)... I got this 4x6 picture frame which is just way cool. It's like a dull metalic ruby red with a silver outlined border, it's cool. I almost got this way awsome soccer jersey like Nike shirt... but I tried it on and I needed a little bit more (well actually a lot more muscle) to make it fit right. Then I had lunch at Applebee's (not my favorite but it was okay). Then... ummm oh yeah! The number one highlight of my day... I GOT TO WORK FOR THE FIRST TIME! Yes, at Kroger! It was my first day. I got there at one and watched like 3 hours of videos on personal safety, customer safety, co-worker safety, and how to properly bag groceries (it's really quite an art if you do it right... keyword "if"). Yeah then the rest of the time until 6 I got to actually bag groceies. It wasn't that bad... I was kind of slow but, I think I will get better. I don't have to work for a long time cuz i'm just a "bag boy" right now, but once I can be a cashier (I have to take a class which isn't available right now) I will have a lot more hours. But I think I'm gonna like working there it's a start anyways. It's MONEY! YAY! MONEY! LoL. Ummm there was this old woman bagging next to me and it was so funny she yelled out, "I need a bag!" then she ran,literally, (even though we were only like at the max 6 feet apart) to my counter and was like "BAGGY BAGGY BAGGY BAGGGY..." then she mumbled something really loud but it was such a mumble you couldn't understand her... but she was really pissed. I hope not at me. Poor thing, I think she had a problem. Then... so it was like "beep" "beep" "beep" "beep" "beep" "beep"... every two seconds, that got way annoying! But oh well. All in all it was a good experience, lol. Yeah... so before this thing turns into an epic I should go... it's a little long. WAIT! As great as working was I would had rathered been at Peaks View Park with well... them (as in the person)... that would has been awsome. But oh well i'll just wait until August 17th to see them, I hope it works out. I like them soooooo much! Yeah, so i'm outta here, holla!

I have like a tumbling class at 9 so i'll be leaving in like 10 minutes. But oh... 9 is not even early i've had tumbling classes at 7 in the morning before. But it's okay... I have fun. These strange times are just the only ones my instructor has available for private lessons cuz she has so many cuz she's the best and everyone wants her! Yeah! And I have her! LoL. Just got to get up a little early... but oh well... i'll sleep in tomorrow. No wait! Tomorrow is Sunday, I have church. Well it's okay I like church! Ahhh guess what?!?! I get to work today! I can't wait! It's gonna be awsome! Or the money will ($$$$$...). Yeah... and like yesterday I went over to a friends house it was... interesting but fun! We watched some episodes of this sitcom "Strangers With Candy" not the most wholesome show, but oh well. It's pretty funny! I didn't understand the towel part... but okay... thats just me. And we watched "50 First Dates" great movie gotta see it, bye!

Then like that night I had tumbling that was super fun, except I was the oldest kid there and this little girl out tumbled me. But it's okay... I sucked it up. Then I went to Kroger with my mom to get some things and I ran into the manager there whom I had previously conversated with about getting a job. And he said he would call me Thursday night that he wanted to get me working as soon as possible. Then I came home. So here we are Thursday night... he called. I work Saturday at one! I can't wait. Although I almost had a sort of date (if you read this can I call it that... or no?)... well a get together. LoL. Which I was really looking foward to... but job money... okay. So yeah I start Saturday! Other than that today... ummm, I ran... I layed out in the sun, I swam, I bathed my dog... and yeah... that was all. LoL... well yeah.

      Well... it's fun being out of school... but i'm kind of bored. This morning I had to go over to my grandpas and clean the grass (which was like three feet tall) out of this ditch so the drain wouldn't get clogged up. Woah... it was hot and I got all sweaty and... dirty, ugh! And BLISTERS! Then tomorrow I have to go clean my grandma's house for her. But I get paid for all this! LoL... so that's a plus. But even better! I got a job at Kroger! Like... umm I start next week! Yay! I can't wait ($$$)! Well minimum wage... but hey it's better than nothing. I need a new computer and clothes! Yeah... lol... umm and I went swimming today and tried to layout in the sun... but after I worked in the hot sun it went away just when I wanted to layout. Then like, umm... yeah I just kind of lazed around the house and chillaxed. I haven't got to talk to my huge "crush" (well it's way more than a crush.. way more!!!!) but I havent got to talk to them (them being singular... just I have my reson for the use of them and not whatever else you may use)... lol, but yeah... and not talking to "them" makes me sad... I hope they like me as much as I like them! I like you!!!! So much! You know who you are... WDD! (<--- their initials... ahh), lol. Well i'm gonna go, see ya l8er!

      Today... was great! I went to church this morning. Pretty fun... well not fun exciting, but the message was good. Ensuite (then)... [did I ever mention I got a 98 on my French exam, it was great] anywas... then I came home... ate a hot dog (leftover fromt hat stupid cookout we had the night before) and took a huge nap. It was great, I was tired. Yeah so I woke up at like 4 and left for cheerleading practice at 4:30. It was so much fun! I got to throw basket tosses for the first time. I thought it would be hard but it was pretty easy and my group got our flyer up really high. Ofcourse she weighed like negative 4 pounds but she's healthy. I really wanted to fly in the basket toss... but they won't let me. It's just because i'm a guy. But some guys fly. It's a great crowd pleaser in like competions and stuff. But anyways... it's just the way it has to be. Then I came home and watched "Bringing Down The House" in French with English subtitles, that was interesting. LOL... and now i'm going to go... think about that certain person whom I like so much... but i'm not sure they like me... but oh well... AU revoir!

Lewis called and wanted to meet me at the mall to buy cheerleading shoes in thirty minutes... well sorry but it was a little short of notice. I had a cookout anyways... big whoop there. It was such crap! I didn't know anyone, lol. And I ate way to much, i'm all fatter now. Ugh. Yeah... but oh well... so it was just bad. My friend was gonna come over but she couldn't cuz her cat had kittens, so she wanted to be there with them, lol. Yeah so that was the extent of my day... l8er!

      Yeah, so today was kind of boring. I got a haircut... cleaned the house a little. Went to graduation... I thought it would be boring. But, suprisingly it was sort of fun. Like see all the people with and without honors and stuff. But it did get kind of long after awhile. But these two seniors (well they graduated now so... but anyways) they did this beautiful duet. It was so pretty. I hope there was some kind of director there that heard them and is gonna hook them up. Or like something, American Idol... I dunno but they were so good! LoL... that was the extent of my day, lol. Well i'm gonna get some reast, l8er!

      Yeah, like exams... and i'm just like what? LoL... i'd take SOL's over exam's anyday! I had Algebra yesterday and lets just say "F"... and then Health (very easy) and English (grammar peice of cake, figuring things out about a stupid Shakespeare thing you have never read before  -- he's such an idiot)... or I am for not understanding. Creative Writing and Science exam tomorrow those should be pretty easy. But ugh French Thursday... that's gonna suck. Ahh yeah well anyways. Tumbling tonight, i'm super excited. Well i'm gonna go out an swim... l8er!

      Yeah so it was good, lol. I went to *church* this morning. LoL... but unfortunatly I missed it this evening... but I had cheerleading practice. It was my first practice with Cheer Storm, it was so great! We learned this way totally awsome stunt VHSL won't let us do in High School... it was so great. I got to base this really cute girl, lol. Her name was Bethany... isn't that a cool name?!?!.... she was so funny, she'd like laugh and she sounded just like a chipmunk. The only bad thing about practice was I like nearly killed myself on one layout. It was like so high and fast I did like 1.5 and since it was .5 I like couldn't land except on my back. It hurt so bad!!!!!!!!! But then I got up and did it right. LoL... Then I came home and my dad had the pool fixed for the summer so I went swimming. It was a little cold, but it was fun. Swimming is really good exercise! LoL, so it was great. Well I better be going, school tomorrow! L8er!

      Well... Saturday... it wasn't bad but it wasn't great. Got up at like 7:30 and was at the library by 9 to tudor this girl for our Science exam (librarians are really mean). It was okay... other than I about froze and well... I had to get up early. From there I went to a friend's house and we hung out and watched a few episodes of "Strangers With Candy"... quite funny actually. "Do I sound like a bird? A big bird or a little bird? How do you like my eyes? How do you like my...?" poor Jerri. LoL.Well then from there I came home and ate and was supposed to meet Lewis at the mall to pick out shoes for cheerleading, but he never showed up. So I was like super pissed, like gosh it made me mad. But I ended up getting this really cute outfit. It was dark khaki cord shorts and this like button up shirt to match them, it's pretty cool. LoL. Well yeah.. so that was my day, holla!

      Well so I didn't get to tudor that chick. The library closed before we got there... so we made plans to meet there at nine in the morning... so much for sleeping in late. Other than that I need nothing tonight. We like got some pizzas and I watched some movies with myself... and fell asleep. LoL. Well i'm going back to sleep i'm beat see ya'll l8er!

      I was so busy yesterday... I need a break. Like I had school (Bedford County is out for the year -- how unfair) and then I had to go to this super boring banquet with my Dad, for my sister only she wasn't there because she's still in the hospital. It was good food though, I must admit. But well... foods the last thing I need to worry about... i'm to fat. But anyways... yeah... oh and then I had to go see my sister at the hospital and well that's just never fun. And really all I wanted to do was talk to a certain someone... but well... were both way to busy and hardly ever get to talk, and ahhh well it's upsetting. It's like when you want something so bad but you just can't have it, how dissapointing. But okay whatever... i'll be patient. Right now it's FRIDAY (YES!), lol. The last Friday of the school year which is great. I'm in lunch right now... lol. But yeah... well... i'm not looking foward to next period, Basic Technical Drawing (BTD)... it's so boring. We are drawing "isometric" drawings right now (btw I thought isometric was a type of exercise... or maybe that was isokenetic ::rubs chin::). What does "iso" mean anyways? Well I better be going, I think i'm going to study for my exams. Oh yeah this girl asked me to tudor her for the Science and French exams... so were doing that tonight. What a fun way to spend you Friday night. Ugh... I wish I could spend it with someone else ::winks::... but oh well. Our time will come. And my time to leave has came, later!

      1) SCHOOL!... i'm giving up... went outside (atleast I didn't skip!, lol)... anyways, two of my classes went outside today. One of them creative writing I actually studied for my science exam and the other BTD I did my nails, lol. 2)I was supposed to ride home with my sister after school and she wasn't there... but she had a good excuse. She was in the hospital. But did anyone make an effort to contact me and let me know? SURE DIDN'T (maybe if I would of had a cell phone ::coughs::). 3)So anyways... I finally manage a ride home... then have to turn around and manage a ride back (my parents are with my sister at the hospital) for cheerleading practice! AND LIKE NINE PEOPLE (out of 20) SHOW UP! Gosh... no one even cares! Maybe that was the problem last year (I wasn't on the team) when we didn't get state! Which we should had... it would had been three years in a row. But NO, people are lazy! Well I care... watch out state here I come! (no I in team but you got my jist)! Then... well some good things about my day I guess... euh... I had a great tumbling lesson, I did good there and when I was downtown... I definitly picked out some perfect resturants for a few dates this summer (that person knows!)... or better know I want to date them!... because I do! Anyways then this could be both good and bad... i'll dish the bad first... my parents got in this huge fight and so my mom stayed at the hospital all night and my dad came home (b.t.w I really don't like my Dad). But (this is the good) tonight he was all cool. He's letting me stay up as late as I want (on a school night! YaY!) and his only requirement was that I got up in the morning without any lip. Mais (but), he's letting me sleep late and show up to first period late! Woah how cool is that! Well yeah so that was my day! Woah such a long posty thing, lol. Peace out!

      What a great day! Not! ugh... i'm just so sick of school. In Algebra today we played kick ball (outside that is) but I mean, gosh how old are we? And yeah, we have an exam Monday... well I just hope I pass. Anyways... i'm excited about tonight. I have cheerleading open gym (aka practice). We just can't call it practice cuz it's illegal to start practice this early (stupid VHSL rules)! So we just call it open gym because in open gym your not required to be there... (the difference between practice and open gym)... but everyone knows they should be there. But I don't mind, because it's super fun! I can't wait until I get to cheer at my first football game! OMGosh, last night Charisse and I went and saw our schools rendition of "Who's Line Is It Anyways?" It was so great! We were like crackin up! Haha, it rocked! Well... I guess I should go study for my exams... me failing my Algebra exam would be mostly Mrs. BJ's fought cuz she is a crap teacher... but I guess to some extent i'm responsible, wait! No! I do my part... she just is a crap teacher, so there, lol! Well l8er!

        Because i'm a cashier that's me making my own money. So if you come through my line... don't briiiing produce! Yeah... because produce is so hard to ring up. Gosh... I had like 2 hours of floor time today after training and well, everyone bought produce I didn't even know existed. Like there are 500 different typed of potatoes/peppers/onions... and etc. My training woman I didn't like. She didn't know how to teach, she repeated herself to much, she smoked during break and proceeded to breathe in my face. ::coughs::. But once I got on the floor this guy taught me a lot. 6 Pack bottle drinks are evil as well as produce. Gosh... with one pack of drinks I had my share of voiding. WIC! I hope I never get a wic order... they look complicated. Oh well. LoL... the guy that trained me... ugh! Different story, different time! Wow... ummm... yeah. So I was supposed to get off at 4. But I got off at 3:15 so I went next door to Barnes & Noble and hung out. Bought some cool French books. Cuz i'm rusty and need to review. I was at the Tanglewood Kroger today. It's so nice I wish I really worked there. It would rock. Then we went and picked Charisse up. Met my rents friends and went out to eat. It was great! LoL. Yes... it was fun. Then Charisse came over and hung out at my crib, lol. She rocks! We watched Chicago. She saw the play at Heritage but hadn't seen the movie. Wow they're both good! I bet the stage manager for Heritage's was way better than the one for the movie. If they even have one for a movie. LoL. Well... I know the stage manager for Heritage's was better. Cuz he's to coolest guy I know! Then we took her home. Ahhh it was so embarrasing! My dad drove her home in his police car. I hated it. Gosh... arg! So embarassing! Ugh! Sorry about that Charisse, if your reading. Then I came home and got online. But I think i'm gonna head on out. I wanna go to bed, i'm tired. C*yall l8er!

        Didn't do a thing really today. Slept until 11. Umm... cleaned a little bit. Yeah that's about it. I went to the mall tonight with Tiffany. It was fun. I met her cousin (Jessica) and her sistser (Krystal)... they hung out with us. It was fun. LoL. Didn't buy anything, cuz i'm broke. But oh well. Ha,.. I did get a Caramel Latte and a caramel "suprise" brownie. I never figured out the suprise... and... it wasn't very good. But hey it was my dinner. LoL. Brittany Sensabough made it for me... I didn't know she worked at Java Stop. I'm not friends with her anymore though. We were only friends way back in 6th grade when I dated Jennifer. Loose Jennifer loose her friends (which btw is a good thing... ahh didn't like them.) Ha... ne ways... ummm then on the ride home I called Charisse. She might be coming over tomorrow. I hope so. I havent seen her since school has been out. LoL. She can finally see my room! yay! LoL She rocks... along with Katie. Wow! Yes... (that'd be Katie Whimmer not Katie Nolen ugh..)... ha... aww and Danielle she's at the beach she rocks also! Yeah... wow I havent seen Danielle in forever. We were doing something like once a week. But now i'm to busy. I miss our time together. Ahhhh! Strangers With Candy... so hilarious. Aww and her cute little kittens. Oh well. If your reading this we definitly have to get together when you get back! Well i'm off to bed. I have cashier training tomorrow from 9-4. It sucks cuz I have to miss tumbling at 9 for work. And I really want to work my full! Gosh darn. Lisa probably thinks i'm getting lazy... i'm not I really want to be there... but I have to work well train. Gosh! Well i'm out! L8er! Thinks for reading!

  I guess you would of had to been there. But it was great. She was awsome she jumped from booth to booth seeing how late it was no one was there. And then she was like "Well I don't mind I don't have to sit there." Then randomely one time when she was checking on us she said, "I'm from Ohio where you guys from?" then my dad told her then he was like, "How did you get from Ohio to South Carolina?" and she looked at me and said, "Scoot over." and she sat down beside me and told us. Wow... it was great. Haha, lol. But nvm. Oh and another thing. Never eat at the Giant Crab... its a disgusting seafood buffet. No, don't eat there. It... was terrible! ugh.&nbsp;

  I covered the beach trip... but I didn't cover Wednesday while I was home. So here ya'll go: We first got back in Roanoke and went straight to the dog-sitter (really my dad's parents) and picked Kent up. I missed him sooo entirely much. We had to stay and talk a long time showing our gratitude, lol. Then we came home unloaded the car and it was time for me to go to tumbling. Went there, did really good. I think the break from tumbling did my body well. But now i'm back in for action, ha! Ensuite I stopped by Kroger to check my schedule. I was excited to find&nbsp;I will be cahsier training&nbsp;Saturday. Not sure what time yet though... I will have to call Tim and ask him.&nbsp;Then came home and called Danielle then got online and went to bed.  &nbsp;

    &nbsp;
  Now today:&nbsp; Wow! I slept until 12! I'm so lazy. But then I walked out to my grandma's and helped her clean a little bit. Came home... took a nap, ate, watched some tv, then went with my dad back out to my grandmas and mowed her grass. Ha, at first I couldn't get the push mower going but I finally did. Then I had to mower a bigger part of the yard so I went to use the riding mower but it was out of gas. So... when something out of gas you add more right? Well gass cans are red and they say gasoline. No exception gas cans are red. But sometimes... people don't put gas in the proper can or put the wrong substance in a gas can (isn't that right grandpa?)... so I ended up putting what I thought was gas into the lawnmower but it turned out to be like oil or something. Ooops... but it was in a gas can. I don't know what to do now... I told my dad he was mad. But it wasn't my fault I thought it was gas. So I guess I broke it. Ahhh then I did break the gate. Well just cuz it was old... lol... I shut it to hard and the top hinge broke off. But we got it fixed. LoL... i'm such a cluts. Oh well. However, Allison... I will have you know... I may be a cluts but i'm not a slut! I don't know where you get off... was it even your business. I will have you know... it wasn't. But i'm not... I thought you knew me better than that, I mean we so went to the SOS Conference together. Then we talked about our purity after that... and now this... well, your loss not mine. Sorry hun. But ne ways. Ahhh so then I came home ate dinner, took a shower, and got online where I have been forever and a year now. LoL... I need to go to bed, ha. But my rooms a mess. I havent like finished unpacking/putting my clothes away. Hmm... I should do that. I guess that is what I will go and get done, although i'm somewhat tired. l8er!

        I went to the beach. It was eh, somewhat fun/okay. Our hotel sucked. It was nice but old and the service was terrible. One day the maids didn't even clean our room, what the heck. Oh well. Ahh, and there were 23 floors and only 3 elevators (not even a service elevator for the workers so they were always on with guest). It was just to crowded. We always had to wait forever to get and elevator. Then once you got on they were slow. However, I opted to take the steps a lot the first 2 days but then I got tired of walking 16 flights to our room. The pool wasn't very nice well pools. But the biggest one was only 6 foot deep. I couldn't practice my back dive or anything. I layed out in the sun a lot, worked on my tan. So that was fun. I got in the ocean a lot more than I usually do. Me and my dad went boogie boarding, lol. It's pretty fun. I hated like... getting wiped out though, that sucked. The best of the whole vacation were the outlets. Wow, we went outlet shopping everday (much to my dad's misfortune) but me and my mom liked it. I got: 1 pair Lee Dungarees jeans (low rise, boot-cut) ; 1 pair AE jeans (boot-cut) and both pair have awsome fades ; 1 button up, short-sleeve, olive green dress shirt from Banana Republic ; 1 white, t-shirt that says B. Republic from Banana Republic ; one light blue kind of soccer jersey like Polo shirt from Nautica ; and this solid light blue t-shirt from American Outpost. So it was good. Although I paid for all of that. But I still have money left, that's the joy of outlet shopping. Hehe. If you ever go to Myrtle Beach, SC go to the Tanger outlets off of 17... the Tanger outlets off 501 are okay... but 17 is better! Then Broadway At The Beach... about the only cool store there is Gap. Well there were some stores for girls there like Victoria Secret and some other stores. But nothing for me. Euh... Barefoot Landing is a total waist of time. It's pretty and all but there is nothing there good to shop at. Ummm so both Tanger's&nbsp;were my favorite but the 17 one is better than the 501 one. Ahhh and we ate at Chilies twice. We had never ate there but it was so good. Wow, it was good. One night I had some pasta and the other night I had this "Guiltless Chicken Platter" it was to die for and only 9 grams of fat. Oh and get the Mango Tea it rocks! The Blackberry tea is good too. But the Mango was my favorite. Wow I want some right now, oh well. So anyways... hmm... there are to many hot people at the beach. It's not fair. I was so jealous. But next year i'm gonna go and have 1) a 6 pack 2) a long punky hair cut 3) a friend. Which leads me to another point. It was nice vacationing w/o my sister. But being with my parents the whole time really wasn't that great. Actually I hated it. They never left me alone, like I couldn't do anything by myself. Ugh... but oh well. Next year i'll take a friend and hopefully we will have a nicer hotel. Danielle left for the beach today. It's not fair she gets to stay at The Breakers it looked so nice. I think my favorite looking hotel was Camelot by the Sea. I want to stay there next year. Hmm... oh one night I were my hot pink shirt. It turned a lot of heads. But I don't think in a bad way... like a bunch of chicks were like I like your shirt. Hehe what the heck. But oh well. AHHH! And these 2 girls in the ocean one day were like flirting with me. They were a little young though. They were going into 8th grade. (even though I&nbsp;had no interest in them because of the obvious) but oh well. I was nice. They talked to me forever. Until finally they were like "Do you have a brother or a friend with you? and I was like "No, just me"... then they kind of floated off. It was funny. Ha, but it's okay. LoL. Oh then these one girls... the night of the pink shirt while I was walking to the pavillion. They were like handing out post cards with scripture on them. They were cool, I talked to them 2 of them were 15 and one was 16. Hehe... but yeah so anyways it was cool of them to be so on fire for God. But umm... okay. Eww the obsceneties at the beach are terrible. There are all the nasty t-shirts etc. Once I was on our elevator and this guy like my age got on and his shirt said "Dry hands? Free hand lotions pump here and there was an arrow pointing to his well yeah" and so... eww. Then I saw this other shirt and it said "Silly faggot d*cks are for chicks" Who wears those kind of shirts? Tsk tsk tsk. Hmm... then there were other grose things. Oh well i'm back now... I guess that's about all I have to say. LoL... well on a scale of 1-10, 10 being the most fun. I give the trip a 7.25... so it was okay but not really the best. Okay well i'm gonna go do something. Peace out!

         Wow! This is the first time i've been able to change my font's etc... I like it! Anyways. I spent most of my day packing and cleaning. I do believe I overpacked though. But oh well... you never know what to expect, right? Yeah... so I hope the beach is fun. I'm trying to be positive about it, But I so badly wish I had a friend going with me. Oh well. Other than that today, I didn't do much. I went and picked up my first paycheck. It was fun... about 20 hours which made around $105 dollars. Taxes are stupid though. I mean I guess there good, well honestly, I don't know. But they shouldn't take them out of a 15 year olds paycheck. Anyways then I went and dropped Kent off at the dog-sitter. Which is really my Grandparents (Nolen). It was sad... I hate leaving him. But I know they will take great care of him, they better atleast. I ended up staying there awhile, while my dad took my mom's car to get the oil changed. I ended up cleaning my grandma's kitchen for her. It was either that or snap green beans. LoL,.. I took my time cleaning the kitchen. But... it's quite grose I don't know how she can live in all that filth. But I cleaned it up. Then my and my dad went and had Taco Bell. It was just me and him tonight. My mom and sister went to the Kenny Chesney concert (oh boy!). I felt like such a pig me and my dad split the Grand Combo so that gave me two burritos and four soft shell tacos. Oh well, so i'm fat. Oh oh oh! I was happy that it rained that got me out of cutting my grandparent's grass. Hehe, but well they would had paid me, oh well. Tonight I tried to kill myself. Or my left big toe anyways. It hurt so bad! I had moved my automen over to my closent to stand on to reach something high, cuz ya know i'm short. Then when I was moving it back my toe got caught under it and ripped like half the big toe-nail off my left big toe. It hurt so bad! Ewww! Now my feet will look decriped walking around the beach. Eerrrrr. Gosh! Well so I need to go, were leaving at 7:30am in the morning. So this will be my last post for awhile. Unless our hotel room has internet... I hope so, that'd be cool. Well i'll be back Wednesday! Holla!

      Wow, so I missed her get together at Kabuki. ::sighs::. I wish I could had been there. But if she's reading this, HAPPY BIRTHDAY! LoL. Anyways, apart from that today I didn't do much. I lazed around the pool most of the day. I wanted to have Danielle over but my mom wouldn't let me. I don't know why, she's just pissy. I think it was bad haircut syndrome. Then I had open-gym today (August 9th I can officially call it practice, lol). We didn't do much of anything. I hurt my wrist though. It was weird. But it stopped hurting but now it hurts again, I guess my tylenol has worn off. But like we did 180's up to (i'm gonna spell this wrong) Arabesque then fulled down. And for some odd reason I had to base Stephanie Thomas, and her full was all over the plcae and she fell through mine and Catherine's arms so we caught her low and my wrist snapped over my knee. I don't know... it hurts. Then I went and had Subway ::licks lips::. Footlong, turkey, on Parmesian Oregano bread. Got to try the bread! Danielle got me hooked on it, as well as she got me hooked on Challupas from Taco Bell, lol. But I love them both! Then I had tumbling. I have sucked so bad tumbling lately, I don't know what's wrong with me. I met Mave though she was there for the first time. I can't wait to fly her. She's gonna be so much better than Dani (but probably not as good as Bethany was ::sighs::). Then I came home. I'm here, now... bored. Ugh, can't wait to go to the beach! I still wish I was taking a friend, but oh well. What will I do with my rents though, ugh! Well i'm going to go take a bath and go to bed, maybe. Peace out!

      It was weird, I got up at like 7:30 this morning and was like so awake, I could not sleep. But I didn't want to, I felt rested. Which is odd cuz I didn't go to sleep until around 4. But anyways. I ate some breakfast and read a little. Then watched TV until 10. Then I went out and mowed our grass. I had a terrible time mowing today, I took out the steps on the pool deck. I'm not sure how, just wasn't paying attention to the huge back tire I guess. But there gone. Oops! Then I layed out in the sun. My tan had really faded so I decided to get it back. I swam for like negative 3 seconds the water was freezing! Then I came in and got a shower and ready to go out. It's a funny thing, I got ready (which included fixing my hair) to go get a haircut. I've always wondered if your supposed to fix you hair when going to get a haircut. I always do, but I dunno. It was a funny thing. I got my haircut at this super nice salon / hair academy. My cheerleading coach (one of many), Monica West is a student there and they had this whole free haircut contest thing. So my family minus my sister got haircuts. I love mine, it turned out great. But she killed my Mom's hair it looks terrible, shhhh... and my Dad's is just weird looking. But the salon was very posh, (posh? hmmm well it sounds like a cool word). I liked it I hope I can go back. But the free haircut thing is over, so just a guy haircut there now would be $18. I doubt my parents will pay that much for it. Then I went tumbling. I forgot my shoes tonight cuz I wore flip-flops to get my hair done and I forgot my tumbling shoes. It made things quite painful without shoes. Some people like it but I hated it. Then I came home, got a shower, and here I am. I think i'm gonna head on out though, l8er!

      "I hate you, ___!" ; "Leave me alone, ___!" ; "Go to h*ll, ___!"
Perhaps in your anger or deceit you have filled in these blanks with Mom, Dad, or maybe the name of your Brother or Sister. Maybe you just showed a poor, selfish attitude towards one of them. I'm sure you've heard it a million times, "What if your ___ were to die tomorrow. Then what would you do?" I know I have. I've even went to the point of mumbling to myself, "I wish they would" or "I'd be happy". But do we really / would we really? My Dad lost his brother when he was around 17. My Mom is an orphan and only knows one of her real sisters, and has learned two of her real brothers are dead and she never met them. There always telling me how they wish they could go back in time and change things. Make it so that drunk driver wouldn't of hit my uncle, or made it so my mom's parents wouldn't had given her away. They were both deprived of having great, lasting relationships with their siblings. What have I got to show for it. I started this post out with the thought of my friend in mind, whom blames herself for her mother's death. It's not her fault, she needs to realize that. She told me once she felt terrible about all the times she only thought about herself and yelled at her mom for the most selfish reasons. She wishes now she would had been a little bit more considerate to her mother's feelings. But it's not her fault things just happen. But could you imagine the feeling? Whether it be your Mom, Dad, Brother, Sister, or what have you... cherish every moment you have with them. Now finishing this post I have began to realize that despite the fights I get in with my family and despite how unfortunate I think I am sometimes i'm really and truly lucky/blessed to have a family. Cherish yesterday and make today count because there may be no tomorrow for one of you.

      Lazy today. Got up early though, probably cuz I went to bed early. I walked my dog out to my grandmas I had to take her same green beans, lol. And on the way back I got stung by a bee. It hurt so bad! LoL. I'm glad i'm not allergic. Then... I tried to get our old computer to work, cuz I needed some pictures off of it, but it wouldn't even turn on. So now what am I to do? Tsk tsk tsk. Then I went to open gym. I did something new with my hair, it turned out way cool. But I still need a haircut, and i'm getting one tomorrow! Finally, it's long over do! Then I did nothing the rest of the night. Oh oh oh, at open gym I got my windsuite and my bag. I was excited. I look really dorky in the windsuite though, oh well. Hehe. Welp, i'm gonna bounce.

      Went to church twice today, it was good. I was excited to be able to make it to the evening service. I usually don't cuz of cheerleading but practice was canceled tonight. Some gymnastics competition in the gym. Other than that I took a huge nap all day, I was way tired, still am too. Watched a little bit of cheerleading on tv. I only caught like the last 30 minutes of it. I'll be on tv one day, or I hope. I'm way behind those people on my tumbling though. But they were like college so I just need time. But i'll probably never be that good. This one dude did roundoff layout, front punch, fronthandspring stepout, 3 whipbacks, double full. It was awsome. I'm so jealous. Well, i'm way tired for some reason, i'm gonna head to bed. L8er!

      Woke up at 7, left for cheerleading at 8:15. We stunted a little, or the other groups did. Coach Belinda West finally realized how, shall I saw, DANGEROUS Dani was and told us just to watch and learn. After that we learned the cheer section of our routine and connected it with our formation for double russions/toe-touches (whichever you prefer to call them), then from that we set up our big tumbling sequence. Ashley Creasy and Connor can full already and Ricky said, "Who's closest to getting there full next?" And Alisha Smith said, "SAM!". Ummm... I just started working on it, but i'm no where near close to having it. But Ricky put me in the routine doing 2 standing backhandsprins full! So, I really need to work hard on that. Wow, it's gonna be tough. Then I got straight from that to Round-off backhandspring layout, that's not biggy I have it. And in the cheer I have a backhandspring tuck, then at one other part in the routine I have Left Hurdler, Right Hurdler, Backhandspring Tuck. So the rest of my tumbling is easy just not the full. Oh well, i'll do it. After that (wow this will be a long post). I went to work. I had to do grocery carts today. That wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, but I would rather bag groceries. I determined 4 or 5 buggies is a good number for me. The most I did was 7 but with 4 or 5 I can push them easy and fast and stay out of peoples way. I HIT A GUY! But it was so his fought! But ofcourse I had to apologize he was rude. He backed into the buggies I was pushing (I didn't hit him) but I was like, "Sorry about that sir." and he was like, "Well, I don't think you are sorry, I don't think you were watching where your going." and then he stomped off. I don't guess he complained cuz my manager didn't say anything to me. It was hot pushing buggies and the sun wasn't even out. Oh and rain definitly does not keep you from pushing buggies. My manager came out so I was thinking he would tell me to quit since it was raining but instead he said, "Your doing good but if you see lightning come in and bag groceries". Well, there wasn't any lightning so I just got drenched. After work me and mom mom ate Chinese. I like froze cuz I was wet and it was cold in the resturant. It was quite funny though cuz there was corn on the cob and potatoe wedges on the buffet. I was like what the heck?!?!, lol. Then I came home, but I think i'm going to take a nap, i'm exhausted. Later!

      Ricky taught CheerStorm part of our routine today. Except, my groups flyer (Bethany) quit. So they put Dani in my stunt group and pulled up a Salem girl for Dani's old stunt group. It was insane! Dani does not know how to fly, she stinks. Our group couldn't hit any of our stunts. Dani just started flying and can't even full yet and they had her doing super advanced stunts. She couldn't do them! It wasn't me (the main base), or Brittany (the side base), or Jordyn (the backspot), it was Dani she screwed everything up. Ricky told us, he was like (this is just how he talks) ,"This group isn't going why? It's not the bases it's the flyer, she must be retarted! Lock your leg out Dani." And she just laughed. It's not funny! We sucked/looked stupid because you messed it up. Oh well, i'm hoping she will get better, but I hope even more Bethany decides to come back. Oh well... welcome to AllStar cheerleading. That was my day pretty much from 1-4. I slept late then cleaned a little bit. Now i'm heading out to eat. Holla!

      Today, I did nothing! My sister woke me up way to early to go to the mall and take back some shoes. I made her buy me breakfast just for the extreme earliness. And the only reason it was so early was because she wanted to beable to spend the whole day with her boyfriend before she went to work. Whatever. So then I came home and slept. I kept telling myself I would go swim laps but I never got around to it. So I slept and watched I loved the 90's all day. That was it, pretty boring. Yeah, well now i'm off to bed. I get to spend the day with the one and only, wonderful Rick Hill, tomorrow from 1-4. It should be pretty good. He's teaching my CheerStorm team our routine, so i'm excited. Well i'm out! L8er!

      So camps finally over. Today was short but I was glad. I'm so sore. I want to get a masage or something, I feel terrible. We just stunted a lot today. We had to learn this crazy pyramid it was like you did a 540 from your stunt group and put the flyer in another stunt group then went up in an inside hitch pyramid, sponge down with a half turn up into a heel stretch, full. The hard part was the 360 switching groups. I was the main base and so I had to turn the flyer then turn myself into the other group then main base the rest until the sponge then my roll changed to side base for the heel stretch. But i'm just thankful we didn't have to do wall splits today! I'll see Ricky again Friday and Saturday. He's teaching us our routine for CheerStorm. I hope he modifies his dances for the guys, cuz the ones he taught us for school were not modified. And well i'm just not gonna shimmy/shake by butt. But he was nice over all, I guess just assertive. Then I went tumbling tonight. I did pretty good. My fast tumbling has been week the last few nights, but probably just cuz i'm tired/sore. Tomorrow I want to sleep all day, but I don't think I can cuz my sister is taking me to return some shoes before she goes to work. But then i'll probably come home and swim/sleep by the pool. Work on my tan, it's faded cuz I haven't been out like all week. Oh well. I'm still looking for my mystery guest for the beach. I don't want to go with just my parents that would so suck. But it's better than no beach at all I guess. Well i'm gonna go to bed. I'm beat. TTYL!

      Yesterday he was nice, today he was evil. NEVER DO WALL SPLITS!!! He made us do them for 10 minutes, no joke. And somewhere in the middle he pushed everyones legs down even farther. It hurt so bad!!! (There is so much more to say about wall splits but i'm condensing). My group finally got the runway wolf-wall today, he changed the name to the Toxic stunt though. But today we had to add on to it and go up in the stunt, sponge down 360 up and back into Liberty Full. The way the pyramid was set up I started out in main base but when it was time for the Liberty I was side-base. Well I had never side-based a one legged stunt before so I had to totally wing it, cuz we didn't get any practice time. It sucked. So after we didn't go up when we went to try again I asked Catherine how to do it and she helped me. We finally hit it. We learned some new side-line cheers today and a dance. I learned the dance Lewis didn't though, but he should had. Ahhh and we got to tumble today! It was terrible, I did so bad. Ricky made me do backhandspring toe-touch backhandspring tuck. I had never done it before, it was a definite challenge. I made it but it was rough. My lay-out I showed him was way bad though. Maybe I will do better tomorrow. But tonight at tumbling I did really good. Lisa was out of town but Eric and Johnathan did the class. Eric was a suprisingly good teacher, I liked him. Then this VT Male Gymnast came to the class, he was so good. I was jealous. But I got to do 3 standing backhandsprings layout tonight. That was a first for me. I did okay with it, since it was my first time. But I piked on it to much ::sighs::. Oh well. I'll work on that. I'm so mad my sister and her b/f are going to the beach with us and they get there own room. What the heck is that about?!?!?! It's so stupid, i'm really mad. Well whatever. I'm gonna bounce, Ricky Camp tomorrow 12-4 (shorter but not short enough, even though I love it, I need to rest, i'm sore). Thanks for reading, l8er!

      1) Ricky is really nice (so far) despite what everyone else may say. 2) It doesn't matter if he's gay or not (don't try to whisper behind his back about it [!!that'd be means for him to be mean!!])... BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER HE REALLY KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING!

Anyways! Camp was fun. Definitly a challenge but fun! I was happy with my assigned stunt group. Minus, Trudy, I mean we tried to use her but eventually had to put Kristen in her spot. With Trudy we couldn't even hit an extension double full. But once we got Kristen we rocked! We were the first group to get our 360 up, sponge, scorpian, sit down, spin up to heel stretch, full (which is called The Perculator). We owned that whole stunt! It was rough but we were the only group to actually hit it more than once. But give us the runway wolf-wall, we sucked at that. We hit it like once with the rest of the pyramid but it was hard. What the heck... it's not normal the way we were suppossed to do that. Oh well. We tried. I learned some side-line cheers today for the first time. They were interesting. I never could get yelling and doing the motions at the same time. PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE!!! OMG, I GOT TO PARTNER STUNT AGAIN TODAY!!! I think I did pretty good. They gave me Holly, so well. She's a good size for me to work with. I got her up into an extension. We never could pop down though cuz once she got up there, I was like pretty much about to drop her (I need to lift weights, big time)... but we did pop-down out of the elevator. (Honestly, extensions and elevators are the names for group stunts, I think there different names for partner stunts, but I don't know them yet. But ya'll got the point, lol). Ummm... we did some tough jumps today. Not to be arogant but my toe-touch is pretty good but Ricky taught me how to make it better. It works too! Like when your at your highest point hyper-extend you legs and they will snap up really fast and really high, it's like woah! It was fun. But my thighs are paying for it now and i'm sure they will be paying for it 100x more in the morning. We didn't get to tumble, I was upset about that... maybe tomorrow. Speaking of which, I better go to bed, I have to get up early for camp tomorrow also.

WAIT! When I got home I ate pizza then I had to go out to my g-rents and pick beans out of their garden. Green beans to be exact. It's stupid! That plus I unloaded hay yesterday. To much country for me! Ahh give me a break! But ahh, oh well. Peace out!

      ...Well that's why you should be at practice all the time!!! But oh well. She makes a potentially good flyer. I based her today while she flew for her first time, pretty good (however, you might lay off some of the beer... ::sighs::.). But she did good! Today was so busy! Went to church. It's silly somehow the Assoc. Pastor managed to work the amendment for protecting traditional marriage into the welcoming morning announcements. I was like, "what the heck?". But anyways. I got home at 12:17 and changed and was back out the door at 12:35. Booster club meeting for CheerStorm at one. I helped the like team below the junior team out (not sure what there called... ?pee-wees?, maybe) while my mom sat through the meeting. Then we went to the mall (Tanglewood, it sucks) and waisted a few hours before my practice. I didn't get anything but some ice-cream. It was the first ice-cream i've had in forver (ofcourse I probably shouldn't had ate it)... but it was so good! It was coffee flavored in a sugar cone... ::licks lips::... I could go for another. Then I went to practice. It was pretty good. We were put in our stunt groups for cometition today. I was excited to have Bethany as my permanent flyer and Jordyn as my backspot, but well I could had done without Brittany as my side base... but oh well. She's okay, just complains entirely to much. Then I came home. I HAD TO UNLOAD HAY OFF THIS BIG TRUCK! It was terrible. It made me itch, sweat, get blisters, and work to hard. LoL (and Brittany complains to much... lol). It was a lot of hay though, we counted 217 bales (or is it bails?)... anyways it was a lot. Then I was all nasty and stinky and dirty and starving. But I went swimming just to cool off. It was a nice evening swim. But once it got to dark I came in an ate. Made a few phone calls while I cleaned my room, took a shower, and got online. I should be going though. I have to get up at 7:00 in the morning. RICKY CAMP!!! This one is for school (12th-14th) then I have Ricky again for CheerStorm (16th-18th) but then he will be teaching us our routine. I am nervous everyone says Ricky is really mean, but i've never had him before. ::Crosses Fingers:: that he likes me. Hehe, well i'm outta here, ttyl!

      ... or the way to take a serious break from ma mère, anyways. We didn't really talk very much today, thank gosh. But I dunno, it's an iffy subject. So I worked, it's okay. It's a job. It could be worse but then it could be better. I had to work with this mean guy from school, and I just don't like him. But we kept it "prfessional". And, I think my manager was hitting on me. It was scary!!! Ahh... lol. Hehe and Leigh Ann she's so funny. I had to go to her at customer service and get like change from a $100 for my cashier. And I like was in a daze and I just kind of leaned on her counter and wasn't paying attention. And, suddenly she just hurled the money at me (it was binded with a rubber-band)... *smack* right in the face. It was so funny. I guess you'd have to be there. I can't wait to be promoted to cashier. Anyways, I worka again Saturday. I get to work outside and push buggies in! Yay! I had a hair appointment for 12:45 Saturday but now I wont be able to make it. I'm so upset though, cuz I had finally worked in an appointment with Monica at St. Pierre's. But oh well. I needed my hair done for the beach. But well i'm still wondering who my mystery guest will be. After work I came home, ate, had my devotions (I caught up, I was like 2 days behind) ::smacks wrist::. Then I watched "You Got Served". It was okay I guess. I only watched it cuz the commerical had tumbling in it, but well the tumbling turned out not to be very good. Oh well. LoL. Welp, i'm gonna go. I'm trying to make my dad leave the living room, l8er!

      I woke up at 5:25 yesterday and my grandma picked me up at 6:00. We were at her work (Ace/Pro Hardware) by 6:30. However, the delivery truck was late. It didn't get there until 7:15. Kind of made me mad, I could had been sleeping. But oh well. We unloaded the truck, I helped. Used my huge muscles, because you know i'm such a beast. Then I got to stock the stuff onto the shelves. That's okay. Just remeber to rotate your stock. Sometimes I would help people find things and ring them up at the register. It's not hard. I learned how to do all that last summer cuz I worked there like ever Saturday. Maybe I will help her out some more this summer, but i'm working at Kroger. Then I went to the mall with my sister. I got the cute Hollister flip-flops to match the outfit I got the other day. And I got this cute Hollister shirt, it's like pale green and it has like orange stripes and it says something but I forget. Then I got cute green flip-flops that are like made out of cord material. And I got a blue shirt that says Hawaii. Ummm... then I came home, we didn't really have dinner it was weird. But oh for lunch I was still at the hardware so I walked across the street to Wendy's and there was this huge line. It was out the door. And everyone had the same bracelet on and they'd get their food and like everyone with the bracelet would walk over to the Civic Center. I'm not sure what was going on. But the people in front of me were like "Man, that's what it's gonna take to be on the team." I dunno what it was about. Then l8er that night I got in a huge fight with my mom. I won't go into details... the post would be like 5 pages or something. But lets just say... i'm not on my best terms with her. AND THE PROBLEM WASN'T EVEN HER BUSINESS!!! Oh well. This is my post for yesterday. I post about today later today, if it's postworthy. Thanks for reading! L8er!

      So, I was supposed to be getting four teeth pulled today but, my dentist canceled "out of town emergency", whatever. It was good in the sense that my teeth wouldn't be hurting and I could go to the pool with Danielle tomorrow. But bad in the sense that the longer this goes without getting done the older I will be when my braces come off :;sigh:;. And it turns out! I can't go to the pool with Danielle cuz my grandma needs help at work tomorrow cuz there getting and order in. I wasn't going to help her, but then my parents made me feel guilty for choosing a friend over my grandma. I don't mind helping her, I helped her like all last summer pretty much and the pay is good. But I just wanted to go to the pool with Danielle. Well, sorry Danielle, maybe/hopefully another time. Other than that "drama" today, I did pretty much nothing. I gave Kent a bath, cleaned the bathroom, cleaned my room, swam at my pool, and watched tv. Ahhh but at one point today I was on the computer and out of the corner of my eye I see this red car that looks like Pastor Marks (my youth pastor) pull in and I was like no thats not him then I saw his wifes (Valerie) car pull in, and I was like oh it is them. Now, this isn't a problem I would usually be happy to have them. But at the time I was wearing just swimtrunks no shirt, our house was dirty, my hair wasn't fixed, and I just looked like crap. I probably had pasta in my teeth from lunch. So they came to the door, the wrong door, and then they said they didn't want to come in but I stepped out on the pourch with them. It was way nice of themto come see me. They stopped by to check on me cuz I haven't been in church the last several, several Wednesday & Sunday nights, they wanted to see how I was doing. They knew it was because of cheerleading, but we had to go over all of it again. Oh well. It was nice seeing them, I really like them. They should had brought Garrett (their baby). OMGOSH he's the fattest like 6 month old you will ever see in your life. Woah that kids fat! But cute, if you like kids. Which I generally don't. Right now i'm baking banana bread. It smells sooooo good. My mom got mad at me (WHICH I DON'T CARE CUZ I'M MAD AT HER FOR THIS INCIDENT WITH ANN SHEEHAN, DREW SHEEHAN'S MOM... GOSH THAT WOMAN MAKES ME MAD.) for deciding to make it at 10:30 at night, but oh well. I wanted it for me and my grandma to have it with coffee in the morning at work. I have to get up at 5:15 AM! She's picking me up at 6:00am, and really 5:15 wont give me time to get ready, but oh well. I'll just look like crap. I need to shave but I don't have time between now and then. I'm excited though, my sister is picking me up from the hardware where my grandma (and I) will be working tomorrow at 3:00pm and she's gonna take me to Hollister to get those way cute flip-flops to go with the outfit I bought the other day. I can't wait. Well i'm gonna go get my bread out of the oven and go to bed, ttyl! L8er! Thanks for reading!

      Lewis (the one I had/am still having the shoe issue with [see previous blogs]) is my senior (although just older not really a 12th grader) mentor for school cheerleading. That means he is supposed to call me when there are cancelations, something special to wear, important announcements, suprise practices, etc... and let me know about them. I had open gym today at the school (or so I thought, assuming I knew no differently, and everything else has been at the school) @ 5:30. My dad gets home at 5:20 and so i'm late getting there. So I walk in and Coach Greenway is there but no one else. She says "Well atleast your here Sam." then a few minutes later Stephanie Thomas (::coughs:: premiscious little thing) comes in. WOW Welcome to William Byrd High School Cheerleading we think. Around 5:50ish Coach Greenway decides to call Coach Wheeler and see if it got canceled. No it didn't but it got moved to Vinton Baptist Church. Coach Greenway didn't know cuz she has been at the beach, Stephanie didn't know cuz she wasn't at home all day (but when she called home to check her messages her senior mentor left one telling her), Sam didn't know cuz Lewis never told him. Coach Greenway drives the two of us over to Vinton Baptist (I HAD TO USE HER CELL PHONE TO CALL MY RENTS AND LET THEM KNOW WE SWITCHED LOCATIONS AND TO LET THEM KNOW WHERE TO PICK ME UP, IF I ONLY HAD MY OWN CELL PHONE I WOULDN'T OF HAD TO WAIST HER MINUTES!!!!). We get there like at 6:15 and I just jump in their but my group ends up being lazy and goofing off so we didn't get anything done! It sucked, I don't know about them but I need the practice! It was weird though Vinton Bapbtist had their own cheerleading matts and they were nicer than our schools ::strokes chin in a refined way::. Anyways! Other than that I got up at like 12 today. Getting up late makes the day seem waisted and long at the same time. Hmm... then I went and layed in the sun until 2:30. Came in did some things, ate, showered, went to open gym (^late might I add^) and also my parents picked me up late. They thought it ended at 7:30 but it ended at 7:00 (If I only had a cell phone). So from there I ate at Sonic and went to tumbling for Cheer Storm. I did good tonight. I didn't get to work on my full though. There were to many people. But it was fun. Came home cleaned my room while talking to Danielle on the phone, got online and here I am. Woah, i'm so upset-ish. Yesterday, when I worked that got me out of a dentist appointment to get four teeth pulled but that appointment got scheduled at 4:00 tomorrow (well really today but since I havent been to bed yet, I say tomorrow). Ouch, it's gonna hurt. I hope I feel well enough to go to the pool with Danielle, Friday. I have a pull party for Cheer Storm, Friday evening but you couldn't pay me to go to that. I looked at the sign up sheet and no seniors signed up to go, so theres no way i'm going with all the little kids. The little girls giggle and act goofy around me cuz they think i'm cute (they tried to whisper it to each other but there whisper was to loud, lol). I think it's stupid cuz i'm not cute, i'm really ugly! Like fat and ugly! Although when Lewis, Myself, and Connor got measured for our uniforms I had the smallest waist measurment, that was fun, lol. Well i'm off to bed myself, TTFN! (This post was way to long, sorry.)

      I woke up, ate breakfast, went to work, worked from 12-5, came home, ate dinner, went to tumbling, came home, took a shower, and now i'm online! Ahhh, work was pretty cool. Well I didn't mind it at first. Bagging groceries wasn't bad. But like each hour it got a little more boring. Tuesdays are senior citizen discount days, that was funny like 5 million old people. And when they approach your counter should the cashier ask (not me i'm just a bag boy)... 1-"Do you get the senior citizen discount?" and risk them being to young an taking offense that you thought they were old enough for it. 2-Or do you give it to them no matter what and risk loosing your job for giving it to people who don't deserve it. 3- Or do you not say anything and have them get mad at you and ask for it? I saw it all three ways today. I think i'd go with 2. Anyways, I got a 15 minute break today. I was one hour short of working long enough to get a 15 minute break and a 30 minute lunch break. Anyways, oh and by the way! Don't put raw meat with sliced deli meat in the same bag! Louis (this manager girl) gave me a like 9 hour lecture on that and I only worked 5 hours. Then I finally got off work, and waited outside for my mom to pick me up. She got there like 30 minutes late, I don't know where she was. I should had called her on my cell phone and asked but, WAIT I don't have a cell phone ::snaps fingers::. Then I came home and ate, it was good. We had take out from Applebee's. Not my favorite but I hadn't ate all day. Except the huge salad we ordered I dropped and it went all over the floor and who knew dogs liked salad? Now Kent (my cute little 9 pound dog is sick) and he just snuck like one bite. Then I went tumbling, I was okay tonight, a little sloppy. I got to work on my full twist again, i'm stuck on the half though. That was about my day. I just finished talking to Daniel, so i'm gonna go have my devotions, but i'll be back l8er. I want to make a post tittled: "How To Make My Job As A Bagboy Easier". LoL. L8er.

      My parents both had the day off, today. That so sucks. There so annoying. I guess i'm lucky to have them and all but, then again maybe not. I was up at the like break of dawn (thankyou, Dad) because he was yelling at my mom. Then He made m mow my grandma's grass, I don't mind I guess it's better than her mowing it cuz she's all old, and she pays me. Then I had to mow our grass, but I broke the lawnmower. Well it didn't break but I changed gears without holding down the clutch and it was like making this hideous grinding noise and it turned off and I couldn't get it back on. But my dad did something and it started working again, unfortunatly. Then I swam, took a shower, ate dinner, and watched Minority Report. It hadn't seen it yet, cuz i'm a loser and I never see movies until like a year later. But I liked it. Well I thought it was a great movie up until the time when the guys charges were dismissed and come to find out he was actually guilty. It would had been so much better if he was innocent and those people really had set him up, and in the end his wife/lawyer proved there guilt and her husband's innocence. Do you think things like that really happen in our army? It'd be kind of cool to be a lawyer. My Cheerleading Coach (Jessico Wheeler) is a lawyer. I want to say a ?public defense lawyer?, I think thats what kind. But anyhow, I think I'd like to be one, but it'd be way to much work. I mean law school, eww. But hey, it's a thought, I dunno, maybe I will one day. Who knows? Well i'm out of here, l8er!

      Hey Hey Hey! Today was great. Well I went to church and Herb taught Sunday School. I didn't particulary care for that. Somehow we ended up talking about how Roanoke has the highest gay population in Virginia. Oh and who had seen the scariest transvestite. Then we spent like 5 minutes on the lesson. Then the sermon, then I came home and chillaxed until I went over to Danielle's house. It was so much fun! I think her mom is really nice, despite what she says. "Lay back down!." LoL. Hehe. And we watched "Strangers With Candy" and played the Sims. Ahh and we listened to some cool 80's music. The original version of "Take My Breath Away" by Berlin is so much better than Jessica Simpsons. We walked down to the War Memorial to see fireworks, but I had to pee super bad so we went back to her house. I didn't like seeing all those kids from school anyways. I'm so un-social. We watched fireworks from her backyard or I mean frontyard, lol. It was pretty. Ahh and we played with her kittens. There like a few weeks old now, there so cute. There are 4 of them and the 2 girls are practically identical like twins except ones a little fatter than the other so she named the fat one Ashley and the skinny one Mary-Kate. I think it's funny, but well... ed's certaintly aren't funny! Then mon père came and got me, he was really pissed off, i'm not sure why. That was my day, lol. Thanks for reading, l8er!

      Just got home from the mall. I got a cute outfit and a pair of shoes and OMG! I Finally got a hot pink shirt!!!!! It's great. It's hot pink and in white bubble letters with a black shadow it says "Pink is the new black." The outfit is blue cord shorts that are frayed on the bottom and this bright yellow shirt to match that says San Fransisco. Oh and I got a pair of boxers to match, cuz it's always nice to have everything match. But silly me, I forgot to see what size the boxers were cuz I was so excited they matched perfectly and then I came home realized I bought larges. Well those wont work. I probably won't take them back though I got them on sale for $1.97, so it's no biggy. I wanted these cute flip-flops from Hollister but I ran out of funding so I couldn't buy them. But when I get my paycheck i'll go get them. They totally go with the shorts and shirt. So much for saving money for the beach, but hey this outfit will be a good beach one, so there. Ahhh and I went back to Finish Line and they had the SS2G's (The shoes Lewis bought and wanted me to buy for cheerleading)... they had them in my size today, so I got them. Just to make him happy. But they were incredibly uncomfortable, and I doubt they will work for tumbling. Speaking of which I had tumbling this morning. It was great fun, minus having to get up so early on a Saturday. But I was twisting, and I got all the way to a consistent half twist. Once or twice I got a 3/4 twist in on my full.  But not consistently yet. It's gonna be hard, but very fun. Alisha, Amber, and Pamela made it to tumbling this morning, so that was good. Alisha is like the best morning person I know. Holy crap, she was so hyper!!! She tumbled really good today! "You fed the chicken, chicken?", what the heck. Anyways... Ahhh! I guess Daniel, or I hope, he will/gets home in the next few hours. That's all cool that he was on a missions trip, but I miss him. Ahh... I can't wait to talk to him! But right now, i'm going to go catch a quick nap. I'm exhausted! Salut!

      Yeah, so July 3 tomorrow. I can't wait, I really miss that kid and want to talk to them. Well there not a kid, lol, but I dunno what to say to make things not so obvious. Well, beating around the bush like this really makes things... ackward, so i'll just get it out. Ha, I don't particulary care who reads this, so yeah that "kid". Is a he! Daniel, ahhh the most awsome guy that there ever was/ever will be. He rocks... and yeah. Anyways, I baby-sat today. That's never a fun experience. But I got some money. Then tonight I went out to eat with my mom. We were driving around Valley View Blvd. and there was this new resturant. We were both like where the heck did that come from. Like it's only been like two weeks since we were out there and it was suddenly a new resturant. It was called "Flat Rock Grill". It looked really nice. So we like were going to eat there but there was an hour wait, so we just walked across the street to "Red Palace". It was good, but I totally ate to much. Then we took my shoes back to Rack Room, and went to Target. I love Target. Finally we like headed home and on the way we stopped at Kroger so I could check the schedule. I was so excited to see that I work Tuesday from 12-5 and then Saturday from 1-6. It's gonna be great! Now i'm home, but i'm gonna hit they hay, lol. I'm dead tired. Ugh... yeah. Goodnight! Miss you DANIEL!

      I did like nothing today. Well I ran, so that was good. Except I passed Mr. Altis and I had to talk and be polite. I'm so sick of his kid, Lewis (the other male cheerleader at my school and he's on CheerStorm with me). Anyways, Lewis is soooooooo imature. He's 17 and ahh he acts 2. And like we had to have matching shoes, and it wasn't working out that we could go shopping together. So he decided to take it upon himself (and he is my "Senior Captian" for school. Like 5 Girls get one senior Girl to make ther decisions and I get Lewis. He isn't even a senior yet, just older than me. So he will be dictating over me the next ummm 2 years, it's crap!) to go buy some shoes and then he had the nerve to tell me I had to have the same ones. Umm... I just thought it should be a mutual decision, but whatever. So like that Friday I went to the mall with Tiffany previously to meeting her I went to Finish Line and tried on the shoes. 1- They didn't really have my size 2- I hated them in general they were heavy and there was no way I could tumble in them. So I bought another pair instead. But they turned out not to work for tumbling cuz of the rough things on the bottom so I have to take them back. But he's like telling me I have to get his shoes and NO i'm not gonna, there crap!... Anyways I HATE LEWIS and I had to talk to his Dad. Other than running... I layed out in the Sun like all day and swam on and off, lol, that's all I ever do. Tomorrow I'm baby-sitting, so i'm excited about the money, lol. I want bunches for the beach so me and my "mystery guest/friend" can do lots of things. LoL. Well i'm out of here, l8er!

I'm gonna do it until I start getting more hours at Kroger then i'll just work at Kroger. I wish she would had told me this before I got a job there. Oh well. L8er!

        Practice this morning. My grandma took me I was so close the being late. But I wasn't. Meghan was though so we had to run the amount of time she was late which was a minute 40 seconds so it wasn't bad. LoL. Practice this morning was just so so, I was tired. Then I worked. Not much to say when you just push buggies all day other than... it totally sux-orz! I saw my 9th grade Earth Science teacher though, she's cool. I was so happy to finally get off work today. I wish I could cashier more. Then I went to *competition* practice. I was late cuz I didn't get off work until 5 and practice started at 4:30... but Coach Jessica excused it, cuz it was her fault in a way. Long story really, so i'm not going to type it. But umm... then my mom picked me up and we ate at BoJangles. Bo to Go!!! Ha, lol. I swear that sign said that, but I guess not. Umm... it was suprisingly good. I didn't know Ashley, the one who dated Seth Walton, worked there. But, she does. Crap what is her last name?... I dunno.  Then I went tumbling, lol. Gosh... to much for one day. I was so tired. But I tumbled okay. Then like now... i'm at that point beyond tired when you can't quite sleep. It's somewhat fun. I get to sleep until 9 in the morning, yay! LoL. Cuz Ricky is coming from 11:30-7:730 to teach us our routine. He will be so pissed, cuz were not hitting all our stunts. Oh well... we have awhile until competition. I want to fly so much! LoL. It just looks so fun. Oh... umm... today my stunt group for "Toxic" hit the whole stunt like 3 times. It was grand. Except Alisha isn't doubling out of it yet, she has a problem single fulling from a heel stretch. But she'll get it. She tries so hard. Oh... and... wow! Were doing so many 360's right now. One in like almost every stunt. I'm the main base and it's killing my right wrist. Ugh so I had to get it taped. Marsha I mean... Coach Patterson did it at practice then at tumbling Eric did it. Eric's was a lot better. Once again... well probably the first for my blog thing, MARSHA DOES NOT KNOW WHAT SHE's DOING! Ugh... but oh well. LoL. She's a really nice woman. Welp, i'm going to attempt to sleep. Umm... I need it, l8er g8er!

        I made it, yay! LoL. Aren't you happy for me? I thought I would cuz i'm a guy, but yet I was nervous... cuz my muscles aren't a big asset to the team. The selection of the team was decent. Just a little seniority, but one JV girl did make it (Alisha Smith... she rocks!). I personally think Meghan Morris should of made it and Heather Leffell not made it. But oh well. Then, Kristen Dyer... there is no reason why she didn't make it. I don't understand. Congrats to all the alternates and people who didn't make it at all. Just always try your hardest/do your best. Remeber, next year like 8ish seniors leave so a lot more of ya'll will make competition.   
    
    
    
    
  Apart from that, I ran a mile today (oh boy!) and ran three laps of stadiums. Then practiced. Ugh, I had to use a megaphone for the first time (thanks Lewis!). Then I came home and slept. Ahh sleep, never enough of it. Then I went to competition practice. All the stunt groups we were working with before got mixed up because some of the people didn't make competition. I got put with Shanna Eddy as my side base, Alisha Smith as my back spot, and Holly Walker (yes!) as my flyer for "The Perculator". I got put with Alisha smith as my back spot, Shanna Eddy as my side base and Alisha Penton as my flyer for "Toxic". It was a big difference going from Holly to Alisha. Although Alisha isn't fat she's heavier than Holly. But i'm just weak. We had a hard time with the 360 traveling heal stretch on "Toxic" but we'll get it. (Alisha Penton is so entirely nice though!). Finally, I got put with Alisha Smith as my backspot, Catherine Lyon as the side base, Alisha Penton as the main base, Holly Walker as the flyer, and ME as the front spot for "Dirty Byrd". Everyone hates that stunt but I love it. Oh and I got, wow this is the hardest stunt, Holly Walker as my flyer, Alisha smith as the original back spot, Samantha Hayden as the original side base, then me as the Main Base. So we do a 360 and as we 360 I turn my own body 180 (so is that 540?) and land with Holly now in the arms of Kristen Rawling as the side base and Amber Hylton as the back spot. Then we Sponge up to inside hitch pyramid, sponge down while turning into and outside heel stretch. For some reason even with Holly that stunt is terribly difficult. But we almost got it. Then I went to tumbling. It was a so so night. However, my tuck out of 3 standing backs was way high. So Lisa was like "You want to twist that?" I was like, "Sure" then I realized she wasn't going to spot me. She said she didn't spot full twist cuz there was no way to. So then I changed my mind and didn't do it. But afterwards during my private lesson we realized I was twisting the wrong way! How stupid am I. Everyone has a natural direction to twist. And up until now i'd always went to the left. But we found out tonight I did a lot better going to the right. And I worked my way up to 1 backhandspring half full on the tumbling track. I was so excited! It was great. Then I came home, ate some grilled veggies, showered, and got online. Wow... I have a huge day tomorrow! Cheerleading, Work, Cheerleading, Tumbling. Ugh... I really would like a day to sleep in late. But nope not gonna happen. I don't have a sleep in late day... until... well I don't know. Cuz... practice m-s mornings then church sunday morning. Which I don't mind church at all, just for the record. LoL, actually I am going to have my devotions. I've been neglecting them lately, to be honest. It's sad. I just have been so tired and haven't had time. Except i'm always online. Gosh, I wish I managed my time better. Ugh... oh well. So i'm gone. Peace out!

        Hun, you need to tumble rather you have you shoes on or not. And seeing as how your a cheerleader now and not a gymnast you will have to tumble with them on. So deal with it. Quite honestly, I hate tumbling w/o shoes. It kills my ankles. And she won't do it with shoes. Anyways so cheerleading practice wasn't good today. Totally unorganized. I did some new tumbling combinations. I kept over rotating on my layout so I just tried some new passes. One I did - powerhurdle, round off, 2 backhandspring, tuck, 2 backhandspring, tuck. It was really fun. And Lindsay (the good one) showed me her - front punch, round off, backhandspring, whip back, full. It was really good. Mave tried to gorge my eye out. We were attempting a tripple full down, totally illegal in high school but not all star's. And she like somehow punched me in the eye I dunno, it hurt. But i'm okay. And before practice at work... well.... it was okay. There were only 2 bag boys for 8 registers and half the time 1 of them, I wont mention any names :: co   drew parrissh       ughs:: kept talking to Drew Hundley at U-Scan. Oh well... atleast I know I do things right. I had to get on the like loud speaker intercom thing today. It was so embarrasing. This guy was making fun of me all day (Chris) and well I don't like him. I could almost file for sexual harrassment. But I won't, lol. But he was mean. But so I needed a key to overwrite this woman's coupon and so I was like, "Chris, who has a key?" and he was like, "Wess, just call him." So I was like," What do I dial?" and he was like, "321" and I was like, "What do I say?" and he was like, "Just say, Wess I need you to come to lane 6"... so I thought I was calling him on a phone... but no... I was talking to all the Kroger store. It was sooo embarrasing. And it ended up Chris is a perve and thought it was the funniest thing I said that, then he whispered something to Wess about me. And then I heard Wess say , "If I got the urge." then he used his key and left. I dunno... I was confused/ upset/ *embarassed. Oh well. And I went to church this morning. It was Pastor Andy's b-day. I didn't catch how old he was though. He's really skinny. LoL. Umm... yeah. Well, i'm going to bed. I'm so tired lately. Entirely to busy. But oh well, it's fun I guess... cheerleading/work that is. Except I will be pushing buggies in Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. That's anything but fun, oh well. I'm gonna bounce. Thanks for reading this long, pointless blog. Au Revior.

        Busy day, to busy! Woke up at 7. Tumbling from 9-10. Ate a quick breakfast/lunch at Mickey D's... I didn't know Amanda Mitchell worked at the one in Vinton. She's genuinly sweet. Then I worked from 11-4. Hmm... yeah work. Quick preview: insuffiecient funds on a credit card ; Amber and Wess (2 fellow employees) getting in a fight at my register [The customers in line agreed it was more amusing than going home and watching a soap opera, just glad they werent pissed... but come on guys... lets keep it professional] ; ran out of register paper TWICE ; and I got scheduled to work next week during things I have planned. I don't know what's going to happen there. I am working Monday, Wednesday, and Friday 1-5 and I have cheerleading practice from 4:30-7... hmm. And I work tomorrow from 1-4. Anyways after work, I went to Michael's with my mom. We needed some things for me to make posters with for cheerleading however, we ended up at Wally World cuz Michael's didn't have what we wanted. Then I met Tiffany and Jessica at the movies. LoL, ahh. It twas great! We saw The Village. ::dramatic music ensues:: (

        Boring day! Yes, like total bore! I mowed our grass, broke a peice of the mower... oops but it still worked. Well I didn't even do it on purpose, so there. Then... I dunno, I just was lazy. Yes... oh but then I showered and all and proceeded to have the jeans issue (see previous post). Arg! Then I had to go out to eat w/ my parents, grandparents, and their friends for my G-pa's b-day. It was terrible. Eww... I hate Western Sizzler. Ugh, eww grose. I ended up with some girlled shrimp, which really tasted just like... umm well, steak. And I don't care much for steak, hence the reason I didn't order it at the "steak house". LoL. Anways... oh and they sang happy birthday... I hate that. Oh well... the waitressing staff at Western Sizzler isn't bad on the eyes though. Well some of them are. Gosh i'm shallow. Shallow and fat. After dinner we had to stand in the parking lot and talk to my grandparents other friends for ever plus a year. It was freezing/boring. Ugh... old people can be so weird. But I love my grandparents, lol. Ha... my grandpa better give me his truck. I'm not all into trucks, but it will be better than nothing, and it is a nice truck. I think it's a 97' some kind of dodge truck. No cd player... but, I could put one in it. It's a huge truck. It has like back seats and like 4 doors. But the 2 doors are suicide doors and you have to open the 2 main doors to open the back doors. If that made sense. LoL. Then after dinner me and my mom went to Dick's, Target, and Wal-Mart. LoL, I need some supplies to make my posters for cheerleading with. But we couldn't find what I wanted so were going to Michael's tomorrow. I got some candle's and some new shampoo and conditioner. LoL. Well i'm off to bed, I have to get up early in the morning. TTYL.

Oh but there none to short, I haven't gotten any taller. Just fat. Wow, so now I have to go pick out a totally different outfit. Then get ready and go out to eat. Obvisouly one thing I need to do less of. ::grimaces::.

        This is the first time i've posted in forever. I don't know blogger has just been retarted. I couldn't log in but now here I am. So when did I post last, like Monday... yeah. Wow... lol, so I basically forgot the events of Tuesday. However, I do remeber after my 8-9pm group tumbling class w/ Lisa, I did a 30 minute private. To just focus on my full. Gosh it's soooo hard! I don't know... i'm no where near ready for the floor, but I was getting a 2/4 twist on the trampoline. Except... the gym's trampoline isn't as bouncy as a regular trampoline. But I dunn, it's sad I can't even pull a whole full. Oh well. But then like Wednesday, woah! I was super busy. I worked from 9:30-5. Like 7.5 hours ($$$). It was so much fun. I basically cashiered all day, but omgosh! LoL... in like my first 10 customers I had 2 food stamps and a WIC order. I didn't know how to do either one of them and had to get help. I'm okay with food stamps now, but i'm still confused on WIC. I had a 30 minute lunch break so I walked over to Subway to eat. Yum yum, lol. Then, on the walk back I ran into Tiffany (along with Crystal and Jessica), lol, there great. Tiffany dropped off an application then came through my line. Ha.. produce! LoL... her peach was easy the number is right on the sticker. But, it's when people bring weird things through my line and I have to ask what it is, that's embarassing. LoL... But I memorized some of the numbers cuz I used them so much. Bananas: 4011 ; Watermelons: 4032 ; GREEN Peppers: 4066 euh and that's all I remeber. But for the record that's just green peppers... there are like atleast 8 different peppers. Ahh and one time... someone brought Kale through the line and I was like, "What is this?" and the man said,"Kale" so there I was looking all through the K's for Kale... but come to find out (Thanks Harold) Kale is under Greens and so on the list it's like "Greens - Kale" how the heck was I supposed to know that. Anyways, only a few people got mad at me. Which I think is good, most people were patient. Ahhh I carded this woman for cigerrates and come to find out she was plenty old enough, old enough to be my mom really. But she got highly offended. I thought women would be flattered if you carded them, cuz your like saying they look young. Which she did... but she was like born in 70 something. LoL. Anyways, then I went to open-gym (the very last one). It was okay. It was more female oriented cuz they danced the whole time, so i'm like okay. LoL... ha. But Monday we have our first official practice. Then Monday (Lundi)  night we have School Competition Team tryouts. Which are no tryouts at all. People who want to try out will be selected by seniority down. So... the more talented freshy have very little chance of making the team. I will make it cuz I'm a guy. But... well, that's not fair either. It'd be different if we had like 10 guys interested but right now it's just me and Lewis. Ahh but anyways, after open gym I went to tumbling. It was pretty good. This new girl joined Cheer Storm (Dani quit, ::snaps fingers:: darn)... but Lindsay the new girl is an awsome tumbler. She doesn't fly though, and that's what we need flyers. But I got myself Mave for my flyer now. But, she's not as good as everyone thought she would be coming from Hidden Valley. But oh well... she is better than Dani. Then finally, I came home. I went to bed at like 3 even though I was extremely tired. I forget what I even did until 3. Then I woke up at 11:30 today. I was hoping to lay out in the sun, but it's raining. Ugh... but oh well. So i'm going to find something to do, thanks for reading.

        well... I will have you know... there were lots of typos in that last post. Which there pretty much always are lots, lol. But nah... I came back because I forgot to mention some things, lol. I'm still going to go spend time with God, I just haven't gotten there yet. I forgot to mention though, that I started going through this French book today. Just to review up for when I start back to school. I'm excited about French 2... it will be fun. Might be challenging, but hey theres nothing wrong with a good challenge. I just hope my grades are still good this year. Yeah... cuz that was good making all a's and b's last year (although sometimes I don't know how I did it in Algebra)... oh yeah that's right my my mom ahhh! Ma mere (with an accent) told the teacher off that's right. Then the ec for passing my SOL. But back to le francais ha! The lesson I did in the book today was about the French alphabet and pronunciation. Pretty easy, but it went more in depth than Mrs. Williams ever did. I had forgotten some rules about like different things. So... now I hope i'm okay. LoL. Well now i'm definitly off, l8er!

        So sometimes blogger can be stupid! This whole font thing is sometimes quite complicated. Anyways... woke up at 11. Occupied my own self for an hourish... then did some chores. Ahh... then Danielle called. It was great hearing from her. I missed her while I was beaching it up then she was beaching it up. Ahh... so much... beaching. Went to open gym. Ha, it was pretty much a joke. We ran 2 whole laps around the track. I beat everyone. It was retarted. Lots of kids were all out of breath, what the heck it was 2 laps. Come on now. Then someone walked the last lap, wont mention any names, so Amy (z fitness captian) decided we'd do stairs. That was pretty much easy to. Then we went in and stunted a little bit. Ahh... didn't do very well stunting. Amanda G. put me with a side base a whole like lot taller than me... so our stunts were just a little lopsided. Ha, quite funny kind of. Then I came home and ate dinner. Then my mom gave me some papers that Ann Sheehan (Drew's mom, ahh) wanted me to have. It's an entry form to this race thing. I can either do a half marathon or a 5k. I think, correct me if i'm wrong anyone. A half marathon is 13 miles and a 5k is like 2.5ish miles. So naturally I want to do the 5k cuz i'm just not ready for the half marathon yet, lol. But so it was nice of her. She knew I was interested in running a race thing cuz my mom told her and her husband and Dew run in them... so... she just got me the info. But the race thing is August 21 the same day of my big fashion show. So... what to do. The race is at 7:30am... but I dunno if I would have time to drive him from L-burg where it's at and get a shower and be at the mall by 12. So I guess I have to choose: race thing or fashion show.... hmmm... i dunno. I guess... gosh I hate decisions. What should I do? Well... i'm going to bed... well actually I am going to have my devotions. Some particular, recent happenings have made me more aware. Well... not really devotions they were done with for today. But I just want to spend some more time with God right now... cuz... believe you and me I need it. This... song... on this webpage just let it load all the way and make sure your volume is on tonight... brought me to a great realization. No time to share, but check it out :  urlLink http://www.teenopendiary.com/entrylist.asp?authorcode=B714157  ::sighs::... ttyl!

        Yo,  yo, yo! Ahhh! Today... went to church. It was cool. Pastor Bobby preached cuz Pastor Andy was out of town. Umm... came home for like 15 minutes. Got changed then headed out the door for Cheer Storm's monthly booster club meeting. Hung out there and helped the little kids while my mom was in the meeting. Then went to the mall. GOT A TRUCKER HAT and matching flip-flops (both of them wer $2.97) from Gap. Hmm... Ate lunch at Subarro. It was okay. Then went to Target. Gotta love that store. I didn't buy anything though. I wanted to get this cd by Casting Crowns but they were sold out. Shows how good a cd it is. I love that song by them "Who Am I". Wow... it rocks! Ensuite, I went to Cheer Storm practice. Where I was offered to be a model. LoL. Ha... me a model. Well I said i'd do it. But not cuz i'm hot or anything. I'm really not. But... hey it will be fun. And I get a discount on the clothes I wear if I opt to buy them. The whole modeling thing was offered to cheer storm to get 10 people who wore kid's sizes and 20 who wore adult sizes and some guys. So I me, Lewis, and Connor are the guys. The mall people pick the store each one of us model for. I hope I get Hollister. That'd be cool. Gosh, i'm not even model material. It's just some stupid back to school thing. I dunno. But oh well. Did you know, Aeropostale sells a 27x28 jean for men. I was so depressed... I wish I could wear a 27 waist. That'd so rock. But no i'm stuck in a 30! Gosh... but oh well. Ha... the 28L suites me fine though, i'm entirely to short. Ahhh... I forgot to mention before the mall I went to Rack Room and got some new shoes for school. There just some white K-Swiss with silver tabs. I wanted to get these K's with green on them. But then realized I would only wear them when I wore green. Now if I was just filthy rich I could of bought the green, silver, red, blue, and black ones... then been ready for anything. But well... ha, I wish. LoL. So Anyways. Practice stunk. Like 10 people were gone. But oh well I missed practice last Sunday. Tsk tsk tsk. Stopped by and checked my work schedule. I work Wednesday from 9:30am - 5:00pm. Wow Wednesday will be busy! Work, then Open Gym from 5:30-7:00. Then, tumbling from 8-9:00. Ahh... i'm sensing a good rest that night. Then I work Saturday 11:00am - 4:00pm. I hope I get some cashier time one of those days. Which I can now... cuz i'm trained, ha. Sort of. LoL. I think it will be fun though. Well... i'm going to go read a book or something, l8er!
