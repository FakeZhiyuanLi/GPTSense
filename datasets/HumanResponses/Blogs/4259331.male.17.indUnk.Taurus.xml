Went for dinner wif hui n fan.. lots of crap frm the three of us.. wanna discuss wat to buy for our BBQ nxt week.. walked back to my hse void deck.. discussed what to buy liao.. but.. haven’t book the BBQ pit.. n still haven’t confirm how many ppl going.. sian.. halfway through our conversation.. one short fren of ours, a neighbour of mine.. pei sin greeted us… we joined as in talking.. once she sat down..hui kept calling her shortie n teasing her.. lucky she is not those petty type.. or she is used to us calling her shortie?? Haha.. bad rite.. this is how we make fun other one another.. happily talking abt our pri sch life.. it makes me realized how happy life was back in primary sch.. we buddies.. hui, fan, zhneg, desmond, zheng lin, hock yong.. n the gers.. gin, pei, wei li, melody, melody, yuet ling n charmaine.. how much fun we had together.. but life wasn’t the same anymore after we graduated.. every one left for diff sec sch except fan, zheng n me.. we were posted to chai chee sec together n transferred to bedok nth togther.. we were very close.. but it was juz in sec 1 n 2.. the 3 of us r always together.. going for lunch after sch.. same cca.. came my hse here for soccer.. during sec 3 i n zheng left fan.. we were attached n we felt unfair to bring fan along n leave him alone.. but in sec 4.. all of us went diff ways..  
  
  
  
 

I n zheng got so distant.. he turned so diff.. till I almost cant recognized him.. wat had happened to him.. we lost contact wif him.. everytime all of us meet up.. he is the onli one not turning up n not answering our calls.. not once, not twice, but thrice.. wat does this mean?? He has forgotten abt us?? Having news frenz n forgetting the old buddies?? Haiz.. how I wish I can turn back the time.. we miss him very much.. n dun wish to lose such a good buddy… things can nv be the same anymore.. haiz.. chatted till around 12 n went back for soccer match.. 
  
  
  
 



Miss her very badly.. msged her.. she told me she having a bad sore throat.. very xin ku.. got so worried abt her..  
  
  
  
 

in the morning she said she is fine.. but now.. haiz.. medicine not effective.. dunno wat lousy medicine did the stupid doctor gave her.. she dun haf watermelon powder at hm.. wanted to go buy for her but remembers shop closed liao.. nvm.. tml I go buy for her.. asked her to drink salt water instead.. hope she will be fine soon.. how I wish I can be wif her taking cr of her..

       frenz.. wat r frenz for... i always wonder.. till i started my poly life.. got to noe some good frenz.. we got close to each other ever since we started sch.. studying together at nite.. playing pool n many other things.. we r always together... but things r changing rite now.. i really hav no idea y.. maybe its becoz of the project which causes us to drift apart.. joyce started drifting apart from me n xiao qiang or should i say the other way round..?? i haf no idea y.. we juz find tt joyce has no time management n does not have any sense of responsibility.. can u imagine someone holding to our project outline n has to be handed in to the teacher by 5 n she is still not on her way when we called her at 4.45?? we need her peer evaluation form before we can hand in our project n she is late?? we got a bit pissed off wif her.. since mon both of us were drifting apart frm her.. 
  
 until yesterday nite she told me she was rather depressed.. her reason was she felt neglected n tt everyone is treating her transparent.. taking her for granted.. need her then tok to her nicely if not shout n scream at her.. xing even asked her y she is not with us anymore.. yup.. ben n jason asked me the same qn oso.. i oso dunno how to ans them.. i wish tt everything can be back to normal.. the 3 of us hanging out together after sch though sometimes joyce can be very irritating n likes to give lame jokes.. but both qiang n i r very concerned abt her.. tt time we were playing pool n she was back in sch rushing her essay due at 5 pm.. till 4 she is not even halfway thru... though we were playing, we still tink of her.. wondering how she is doing.. if she can manage to finish anot.. so joyce.. dun feel tt qiang dun cr abt u.. we r all frenz man.. 
  
 EnDinG: I'm still thinking of u..
