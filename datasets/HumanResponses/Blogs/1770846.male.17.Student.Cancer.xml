        Wow, my first post in a long line of posts to this wonderful blogging habitat known as blogger. Phew, this is exciting.   Well I guess I better be going. LOL, big European History test tomorrow for me to fail. I've tried studying my ass off, but it won't do any good; I'll fail just like every other test I've taken from that class.   Here's a list of a few things I've learned about the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment:   1. Louis XVI was so whipped by his people it's not even funny  2. The French are really too thick-headed to realize when their money is going down the crapper  3. Copernicus was so wrong; the earth really is the center of the universe  4. Newton made a big mistake (gravity my ass)  5. Cheese really isn't made out of whipped cream and horse shit (who'd have thunk?)

        Well, right now I'm sitting in Mrs. Baessler's room working on updates and waiting for Mike and James to finish with their LUCID thingy. I'm always choosing not to go to it just because I'm never in the mood to learn about wireless technology. For some reason computer and technology stuff in general doesn't get me as excited as it used to. I'm not really concerned about not taking any computer classes next year because I'm really glad with my decision to switch over to lots of business classes. I guess as one gets older and learns more about one's self, he starts to embrace those things he previously wanted to reject. Hmm... that sounded a lot better in my head, haha.     &nbsp;   Anyway, I watched the DNC Convention last night, and surprisingly, I was really excited about it. I'm normally not too worked up about politics or anything because my opinion doesn't really matter since I'm not old enough to vote yet. I don't know what came over me. I guess it was just the thought of all the big names that were going to speak last night (Al Gore, Jimmy Carter, and Bill Clinton) that made me so enthusiastic. I don't know if I'll be that way about the GOP Convention in August. Probably not, but it'll depend on who the speakers are. I'd definitely get into it if John McCain and Colin Powell started laying down the language, haha. But they probably won't...     &nbsp;   Anyway, I thought all of the speeches were really great. I didn't like Jimmy Carter's speech as much as I thought I would, but then again, he really attacked President Bush like head on for all the mistakes he's made with the war. I didn't expect that from him, and Al Gore was pretty reserved even though he did go off a few times to lament the 2000 election and piss all over the Bush Administration for all their screw-ups. But Bill Clinton's speech was really just amazing. I was totally blown away. He's gotta be the best public speaker all of modern-day politics has to offer. I can't think of anyone, in either party, who can get a crowd going the way Bill Clinton can... it was really amazing to watch.     &nbsp;   Well, that's my wrap up of the first day of the Convention. I don't think the next three days will be that good. I am looking forward to Ted Kennedy night tonight. But beyond that I'm really not all that interested&nbsp;in what John Edwards and John Kerry have to say. Bill Clinton's already sold pretty much the entire democratic party on them. There's not a whole lot left that needs to be said, haha.     &nbsp;   Well sitting here in Mrs. Baessler's room, amongst her many books has me in a very literary mood. Maybe I'll give one of them a quick read until James and Mike get back from their lecture.

        So it's come to my attention that certain readers of  urlLink my previous livejournal &nbsp;are a little upset about my switching to blogger. Well those of you may refer to the photo in my previous post for my response to that.     &nbsp;   LiveJournal sucks. It's just got a gay form to type your posts in, and all the templates are lame. It's also&nbsp;unable to be fully customized unless, of course, you're a paid-for member, haha.     All in all, I'm happy with my decision to change to blogger, and all of you who aren't can, to quote Maria Heinz Kerry...     Shove it.

            So I'm cutting my fingernails a couple minutes ago, and I just snipped my right middle finger WAY too short. I know you really can't tell cuz i couldn't get the damn flash off, haha. But trust me... it looks like hell... haha.

        I've been waiting for almost two years for Google to go public, and finally, it is! But it's not the fact that their going public that's amazing... it's their stock price!     &nbsp;     Investors were startled by a price range of up to $135 per share.       One hundered ad thirty five dollars per share?! JESUS! I really wish I were involved in this IPO, haha. I can't wait until I'm in the business world building up a company and taking it public. It's times like this when it really makes me realize how much I wanna be doing what they're doing, haha. Someday...     &nbsp;     According to Thomson Financial, at $3.3 billion, Google would rank as the eighth-largest IPO by a U.S. company.       Jeeeeeesus...

        Well, I'm at school updating computers... again, haha. Today went by pretty quickly though (in comparison to last Friday, which lasted forever), so that's good. Moberg's back from his vacation, so he got to do the cabling which left me with the updating, which is even more excellent, haha.     &nbsp;   I'm really getting the hang of this blogging thing, and I'm liking it a lot more than the stupid livejournal crap, lol. I don't know why I switched to livejournal after starting a blog in the first place. I guess it was because everyone else had a livejournal. Phew, never making that mistake again, lol.     &nbsp;   Anyway, I've been slowly making my way through  Catch-22 , even though I start to fall asleep every time I get into it. It's not that it's a boring book; it's actually really kewl. I just can't read for long periods of time when i'm comfortable. Maybe I should like sit in a really uncomfortable chair from now on, while I'm reading. Yeah... that'll be better. lol.     &nbsp;   After today, I'll have 12 more days left of work, which is awesome. Also, I'm looking forward to my NYU visit on the 11th, which'll be excellent. All in all, I think the job was a good summer experience... which I'm never gonna do again, lol.

             Ravi Chand of Virginia and Bethany Walker of Ohio kiss on a Boise sidewalk on Friday, July 23, 2004 in Boise, Idaho to promote vegetarian eating. The 'Live Make-Out Tour', sponsored by PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals), is being staged throughout the country to demonstrate PETA's claims that vegetarians are better lovers.     Hmm... vegetarians rock.

        Today (yesterday, technically), I woke up around 9 and watched some TV, then I fell asleep repeadedly throughout the day. It was really relaxing...     &nbsp;   Anyway, I had this dream during one of my naps, and I still remember every detail of it. I'm amazed. I never remember my dreams, haha. I was worried that I didn't dream at all anymore because I wake up without a thought in my mind.     &nbsp;   So this dream started out with me at some fast food restaurant with Mom, and she was ordering something while I was watching the TV tuned to FoxNews connected to the ceiling (you know how some places have TVs situated like that, lol). So the newsperson started discussing some princess (who for some reason lived in Los Angeles) who'd been killed by her new husband. It caught my eye because I remembered all the commotion made about their marriage a few weeks earlier.     &nbsp;   As the news guy started to describe how she was allegedly killed, Mom grabbed me by the arm and pulled me out of the restaurant. She said "You don't need to know what happened." I was obviously taken aback. How'd she know what happened? And why would she not want me to know?     &nbsp;   Anyway the rest of the dream is a little foggy. All I can recall is that the whole thing was basically about me trying to find out how she was killed, and my mom finding clever ways to stop me. There was some dramatic ending, and I woke up just as I was about to discover the details of her death. I hate when that happens...

        This'll be my first post on my new blog. I decided to quit LiveJournal because it was bothering me, haha.&nbsp;Hopefully this'll be a lot more productive than my LiveJournal experience, lol.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Anyway, I've had this account at blogger for a while, and I just realized I posted a really stupid entry before I got my LiveJournal. I think it's hilarious, but in hindsight, it was a mistake, haha. I'd take it down, but I want to leave it for posterity. Everyone can gather 'round and absorb my pre-LiveJournal ignorance, haha.     &nbsp;   It's 12:53 AM, and I've gotta get some sleep...

        Well, it's been a few days since I've posted an entry, so I'll make this one super.      Like everyone else, I got my schedule in the mail the other day, and like most, it was really fucked up. They gave me five AP classes, and that was just unacceptable, so I had it changed on Friday. Now the schedule is final, and if you're interested:      1. Business Law   2. AP American Government   3. AP English   4. AP Calculus   5. Lunch   6. Statistics   7. French 4   8. Rotation   9. Physics      And I've got Mrs. Kaub for study hall again, which is awesome, and Mrs. Lewis for homeroom, which is REALLY awesome, so I'tll be a good year. I'm not worried about having too hard of classes. I think the only one I'm gonna have to really work for is AP Calc, and I'm ready for that, haha. This is definetly gonna be the best year of high school so far, haha.       I stepped on the scale the other day, just for the hell of it, and I weigh 167 lbs. I'm a little worried... I've lost like 13 pounds this summer, and I haven't really changed my eating habits or started exercising or anything. I hope I don't have some kind of deficiency or anything... It may be all the workouts I've been getting from my tennis lessons with Harold though... :-/      Speaking of lessons. They're really going excellently, haha. Harold says I've really come a long way since the beginning of the summer, and I'm looking forward to being at least in the top 4 when tennis season starts, haha.       I've gotta get back into the swing of SAT prep. I haven't cracked a book in two weeks, and I'm worried I may be getting a little rusty. After breaking 700 on the verbal section a few weeks ago, I've kind of relaxed my studying habits a little. Anyway, I'm sure I'll get some more tests in once I get done with the job on Monday (the 9th).       The job's actually getting a lot more bearable. I've been putting some more effort into it in my last few weeks, because I want to leave a good impression when I stop on the 9th. I'm definitely looking forward to some freedom in the last few weeks of summer. I'll probably see some more movies and eat lots of popcorn to put those 13 pounds back on, haha.      I've really got to start reading  The Odyssey  sometime. School's almost coming up, and I'm really not thinking I'll be ready for it what with the length and the archaicness... meh.
