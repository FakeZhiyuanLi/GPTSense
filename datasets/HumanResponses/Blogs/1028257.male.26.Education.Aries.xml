      Wednesday of this week, my wife Elizabeth and I found out that we will soon become parents! Soon, if March is soon for you.   Funny because my wife has always been the one saying "I want to have babies", while making cutesy hands, but since the news has come, really doesn't act all that excited, but nausea can do that to you. Really, the depth of the revelation has not fully hit us yet, but we are very happy.   One of the main purposes of this Blog will be to document the belly growth visually as the next 6 1/2 months pass. Oh, and I guess I will put up some photos when the little one appears.     Also in other news...           I am leaving work soon  (don't worry, I've earned this break)  to head down to Noblesville near Indy to see Sting! This will be my 3rd time seeing him live, and a delayed birthday present to myself. I'll be meeting Jenn Swift and a friend of hers. I'll give an update on this event next posting.

       Welcome to the Official GRAND re-opening of my Blog!     &nbsp;   What's a Blog? A Blog is short for web log, or a website where I can post writing, quotes, links to other sites, pictures, or all three together...in short. Um...     &nbsp;   So anyway... Now that I have a better setup at work on my cool computer (It's still no Mac), I hope to publish daily. I usually show up a few minutes early to check all my e-mails, and websites. Really, where is the effort in writing a short paragraph each day... and adding a picture or two or even links to a few weird news items or whatever?  I thought so. (punk)   Oh, and the really fun part? You can post comments to what I've said, or what other people have said about what I've said! We're a forum, people!&nbsp;  Also, I plan on sending out a very small e-mail with a link to let you know when I have updated with a post. This way, to be my friend, all you have to do is click on the link and see what I said for the day. I'm trying to make this easier than replying to an annoying mass e-mail. Plus I will have content!   &nbsp;

       &nbsp;BOSTON, Massachusetts (CNN) -- When not working on his day job -- lead singer of Irish rock band U2 -- Bono uses his celebrity status to fight for human rights, Third World debt relief and AIDS funding.     He's lobbied both the Clinton and Bush administrations to pay attention to the AIDS epidemic in Africa and continues to return to Capitol Hill, crossing party lines to bring attention and funding to the issue. On Tuesday, he took his AIDS lobbying campaign to the Democratic National Convention, where he answered five questions for CNN.com.   CNN: You're here to talk about AIDS, what are you telling the delegates and the candidates?  BONO: I've just been saying to them that there is a real opportunity for America here -- as there is for Europe -- but especially so for America to re-describe itself in the way it responds to the AIDS emergency because it's a winnable war. There will be tangible benefits.  CNN: What type of benefits?  BONO: It will help solve some of America's own problems because it's now a security issue -- the way we are perceived in the West. We have great pharmaceuticals. They are great advertisements for us, for our ingenuity, for our creativity, for our technology. There is an opportunity here for us. It sounds like the wrong word when you're talking about six and a half thousand Africans dying every day -- which is an obscenity -- but it is an opportunity for us to do something great with this prosperity that we have and this power that we hold.  CNN: Have you met John Kerry and John Edwards?  BONO: Sure, sure, I have spent a lot of time with John Kerry. I haven't met John Edwards.  CNN: What do you think about Kerry?  BONO: He's very well briefed on these issues. In 1999 he was the first guy, along with Sen. Bill Frist from Tennessee, to bring in the Global AIDS bill. He was banging the drum a long time ago. He knows what he's all about.  CNN: When is the new album coming out?  BONO: November.

      I am really sorry for the puns.   We saw Spiderman 2 again last night. It was still great! I really love this movie, and still think that it's the best Superhero movie out there yet. Of course, Smallville gives it a run for it's money, but hey...we aren't talking about that! By the way, if you still aren't hooked (and live near me) I have the first two seasons on DVD, and the third is replaying right now before Season 4 starts, and from the stuff I've read online, this will be the best one yet.   Anyway, thanks to my Mother in Law who helped Beth do some work around the house, and then took us out for fun!

      Friday evening was a great evening for a concert in Noblesville. The sky grew shaded in colors as we watched Dominic Miller (Sting’s Guitar Player) come out and play to open the show before Annie Lennox. The forcast initially called for rain, but as the date neared, it became obvious that that would not be the case.   Dominic played some great tunes, and Sting even came out and sang Shape Of My Heart with him, because they co wrote it. He let us know he was going to watch the Annie Lennox show, and then meet out on the right of the stage to sign autographs.   Annie came out, and played a very excellent set. I’m not a fan, but her songs were not only compelling, but were very enjoyable power pop songs, with some soul thrown in. I very much dug her white, English (I think), brand of spirituals and soul. I think I’d like to listen to some of her music more.   As her set ended, I was able to make it over to meet Dominic, and have him sign a copy of his new album, Shapes. It’s all reworkings of classical music, a lot of Bach. Guests on the album include: Sting, Placido Domingo, Chris Botti…  He was a nice guy, and I felt good being able to thank him for playing earlier, and that he did a great job. Another brick in the façade of celebrity torn down!  Sting played a pretty good set. I have to admit…I was disappointed. I enjoyed moments of the show, and it was worth seeing. During the entire set I was on a rollercoaster of highs and lows.   Highs: Hearing some of the songs live never gets old. Great lights show and use of video screens that move in the back of the stage. High energy on the songs. Incredible visuals on “This War” in particular. 1940 cartoonish airplanes and billboards. And when Annie Lennox came out and did a duet on "We'll Be Together", that was very cool.   Lows: Use of elements of 3 different U2 tours. Wow. U2 will always be higher in my book, and this just proved it. No slam on Sting, and in fact more of a praise of U2 that even now, after their last three tours someone could “borrow” from elements of their tours.   Less of a cohesive concert than others I’ve seen. The songs didn’t seem to gel together, so much as last too long, go to short, or not flow together as a whole of a concert.   The video screens very often, but most specifically during “Sacred Love” had sensual images for extended periods of time. I don't mean to say it was bad but having it going on and on was overkill. What could have been done in good taste and referencing the song was instead too much. After that, I wanted so much to the show second chances, but it seemed everytime something else that was a high came, a bit later would come another low.   Over all, I enjoyed hearing and seeing him, but felt that Sting was not necessarily putting his best foot forward. I will continue to listen to his music, and enjoy it, but I may not rush to see him live again. When I hear from Jenn Swift, I will probably include some of her critique here as well.

      After Church on Sunday,we went out to eat, and shortly thereafter I went to visit my friend Rob Swingle in Wabash. On the way back home, I saw the usual stupid church sign on 1 of 2 churches that change thier's week to week.  Well, this one had me laughing for almost a half minute out loud!  Imagine my surprise when Stevan of  urlLink www.stevansheets.com  fame (so he says), passing through the area, also saw it, took a picture and put it on HIS blog! I was gonna go back and get a picture! He scooped me! Anyway...courtesy (without permission, but with credit given), here is the sign. See for yourself.     Later Addition:   Stevan Called me at work pretending to be some guy from this church, asking me to take the picture down off my site because they were suing Stevan! Imagine, a Church suing because of a sign! I fell for it, but it was because I haven't heard his voice in a while. Also, Being the nice guy he is, he helped me a little with the comments and layout of my blog. Now, if you click on the  comments  link under each post, you will see all of the other comments made so far. Thanks Stevan! Oh, and I am gonna start keeping my camera with me when I go by these signs...

        Today's posting is not new, but this is the first I've heard of it..so I pass it on for your opinion. Please make sure that once you have read this, you click the link to read the article this talks about.     Christian Music &amp; U2 Fan Sites Spread CCM Letter Controversy 5/28/2004 6:36:02 PM Jay Swartzendruber Have you ever read a letter to the editor in CCM and just KNEW you had to respond to someone's "so-called" point by writing one yourself? I know the feeling--though, back in the day, CCM never printed mine. (But that's okay, because "I'm smart enough...I'm good enough...and dog-gone it, people like me.")  CCM reader Rich Copley recently read one such letter to the editor, and he decided to respond. The only thing is, Rich's response was, well, LOADED. Not just because it contained 900 words of articulate, jam-packed content, but because Rich decided to share his response with the more than 200,000 people in his city! And from there, it became an "international incident." (Come again? Exactly.)  Turns out that Rich Copley is the arts writer with one of Kentucky's premier newspapers, the Lexington Herald-Leader. And after reading Christopher Stone's letter to the editor in which he stated that U2's Bono is "not even a very good example of the Christian walk" (CCM's May issue), Copley wielded the power of his sword. Indeed, earlier this month the Lexington Herald-Leader ran Copley's editorial ("We Know Bono's Christian By His Love") which outlined Stone's letter to CCM and then offered a compelling response. Then, before you could say, "Achtung Baby," Christian music and U2 fan sites started posting links to the Herald-Leader's article on the front page of their sites. And the rest is... still unbelievable.  Care to check out the Herald-Leader's editorial? (I thought so.) Click on this link to one of U2's biggest fan sites, and you'll be good to go:  urlLink http://www.atu2.com/news/article.src?ID=3393
