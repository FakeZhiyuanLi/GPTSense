      It was summer - the leather seats on my Granny's navy blue Cadillac were hot and sticky.  Going to the bank with Granny was a normal kind of errand for me and my little brother.  The First American Bank tellers were very kid-friendly; they always sent suckers for us kids when they sent back the money for Granny.  On this particular day, Granny had a telephone set in the floorboard of her car.  She was the queen of mail-order catalogs, and she had gotten this red telephone, with a red cord and handset, from one of the many catalogs that filled the end tables at her house.  The phone had big black touch tone buttons, and I was amusing myself by making lots of clicking noises as I "dialed" familiar numbers.  In 1987, my 8 year-old self was impressed by the thought of a phone in the car.  No one that I knew, like my parents, family or friends, owned a car phone.  As we rode down Nolensville Road, dialing those numbers made my imagination wander and soon the receiver found its way to my ear.  I became lost in a whirlwind of conversations.  Instantly, I became a wealthy young woman (since I had a "car phone"), who was talking to famous people like country singer Reba McEntire or actor Patrick Swayze.  Patrick called me right as we pulled up to the teller at the bank.  Granny would have to get my sucker for me today - I was far too busy talking with Patrick about doing a movie next month to stop and wave at the smiling lady behind the glass.  I felt so important.  I rode around talking on my car phone for at least two weeks, until my brother pointed out that you could see the cord, and that made me look dumb.  He was just jealous that Reba didn't want him to come over and go swimming in her new heated swimming pool.

      I have always wanted to write a book. Just like I have always wanted to finish college, and be a movie star and get married and have kids and own a trampoline. Ooh, and I wanted to be my own boss and be able to take off work whenever I want and not have to make up a reason for calling in sick.  I have accomplished a couple of those things, but not the book. Not yet. I love to tell stories about the things I saw when I was a child. Most of them are true, and some are simply told through the perspective of a 10 year-old's imagination that has become true to this 25 year-old woman. Do you want to hear them?
