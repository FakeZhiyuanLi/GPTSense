      I find baking or any other form of cooking a very relaxing and comforting experience. When work or other stuff in life gets me down, just fiddling around in the kitchen makes me feel that much better.  Well recently I tried to make some chicken and potato puff pastry and it turned out pretty well with some of my friends and family who tried telling me that it was really not too bad...  Therefore I would like to share this receipe with all you out there who loves baking and pies.  Ingregients:  1 packet of flaky pastry 3 pieces of fresh chicken thigh (or any other parts of the chicken that you like) 2 Potatos 100g of fresh button mushrooms  Seasoning 3 Tablespoons of Teriyaki Sauce Salt & Pepper to taste.  Method: Cut half of 1 potato into small cubes. Leave aside. Chop up the chicken thigh into small cube pieces. Marinate with the Teriyaki sauce and pepper. Cut the mushrooms into small cubes as well. Mix mushrooms with chicken to marinate.  Stir fry the potato cubes with sesame oil or olive oil until slightly soft, add in the marinated chicken and mushroom and add salt to taste if necessary.  With the other 1 and 1/2 potatoes, boil until soft and mash with 2 teaspoons of butter.  Mix the stir fried ingredients with the mashed potatos and leave aside.   Roll out the flaky pastry to about 5mm and cut out circles of 7cm diameter. For half of the circles cut out, remove the centre with a cutter that is 5cm in diameter. Place each of the centre cut out circle on top of the full uncut dough circle.  Let pastry rest for 15 minutes before baking. Before placing into the oven (set at 200 degrees celsius) brush the prepared cut dough circles with egg wash to give a shiny appearance when baked.  Bake for 20 mins or until pastry puffs up and turns golden brown.  Scoop prepared filling into the baked pastry case and voila! Sumptuous Chicken mushroom and potato mix pie! Bon Appetite!!

      Today's a thinking day for me... I spent many hours mulling about why it was that I constantly felt so unhappy and depressed all the time...  I finally acknowledged the fact that I am not by nature an extroverted person, neither am I as confident as I have made myself out to be... I finally realized that there are many areas about myself that I have yet to feel secure about.  Recently my job has called for a lot of cold calls and making the cold calls made me experience a sense of helplessness and fear which I could not deny to myself.  Through the years, I have tried to make myself stronger by numbing myself to people and what they say and think about me...  I thought that I had fair success in establishing myself as a person who is confident and independent, yet I realize that it was all a facade that I had put up to face the world and to hide the scaredy cat that I was inside.  It was a facade that I put on to cheat myself into thinking that I was not weak and that I am not afraid... Having to make cold calls let me know how inadequate I was in reality and how futile my mask was in helping me face my own fears...  I am not sure whether I would be able to overcome my phobia of cold calling and with that hopefully gain a new sense of confidence.  At this point in life, all just seems so bleak and even dreams that I have cherished seem so far away and so unattainable...  All the reminds me is a sense of inadequacy and insecurity, a reminder of how weak and how insignificant I am in the huge world...  Perhaps dreams are little more than fairy tales that we spin for ourselves in other to make the lengthy days more bearable??  I don't really know what to make out of life and what to think... My only consolation is just that things can't be that bad since others before me have already gone through it yet that in itself is an irony as it also serves to again remind me that life is just a repetition and no matter what we do... it all boils down to the same ending....
