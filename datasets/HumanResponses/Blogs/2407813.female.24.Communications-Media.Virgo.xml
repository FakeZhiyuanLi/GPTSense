       urlLink Dutchboy  was in town for the first time in almost 2 months this week-end, so there was no yoga for me; my attention went some place else. But now he's gone (again!) and I'm back... Not that I have practiced since Wednesday, though. I've been living in a bubble since, but in a different bubble than the one I was in after my yoga workshop.  Don't know if I'll be able to go to practice tomorrow. I have a  "How to keep your promotional e-mail out of junk mail folders"  workshop from 1:00 to 5:00 p.m. Yoga would be at 6:00... not sure I can make that. We'll see. Otherwise, I'll definitely be at the class on Wednesday night.  What could I talk about now since I haven't practiced in 5 days anyways? Well, once again, thanks to  urlLink fortune  for her meditation suggestions... I always try to do it with my eyes closed, just concentrating on some music ( urlLink Anugama 's  urlLink Shamanic Dream Vol. 1  and  urlLink Vol. 2 , for instance), but I tend to get distracted after 7 or 8 minutes. I've heard about the candle thing before, but strangely enough I never thought of trying it. Definitely will.  Regarding yoga nidra... I love  urlLink yoga nidra . As I mentionned in  urlLink Julie's Garden   urlLink after my second day of workshop , I  always  fall asleep during yoga nidra. Most of the time I don't even make it up to the waist. They lose me around the knees or something. Last time, I woke up before the end, though. Is it an improvement (because you're not supposed to fall asleep) or a lack of concentration? Not sure.   Actually, I'm not sure I fell asleep that time. My body kind of became very numb, I had this very weird feeling that it was becoming weightless or something. It's weird, but I swear that's how it felt. And well, I panicked (me and my anxiety troubles) and I think that's when I started to lose concentration and came out of my "conscious sleep".   Weird feeling, I tell you...

      To most of us, North Americans, yoga is known as a physical practice. Almost a sport.   Yoga is taught in yoga studios and in gyms. Sometimes with meditation, sometimes without any at all. Apparently, there are even some classes where, in big cities where people are so busy they don't have time to breathe like NYC, for instance, people don't stay at the class for  urlLink Savasana  at the end. They just leave because they want all the energizing benefits of yoga and don't have time for its restorative effects.  I am so lucky as to have a very good yoga studio, with amazing teachers, very near my home. I am lucky enough that they insist on meditation, Savasana, and they also teach the basics of yoga philosophy. But they also realize that most people are there for the physical benefits. So unfortunately we don't go deep enough into the philosophy for my tastes.   I'd like to thank  urlLink fortune  for all her insights on what I should read to find out more about yoga philosophy. I won't hide the fact that I'm still a beginner at all this stuff, there are a lot of things that I don't know and sometimes I can make mistake. But I'm doing all this to learn; learn about this practice, learn about myself... The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali were actually next on my list of books to buy. Right now, I am reading  urlLink  Yoga and the Quest for the True Self   by Stephen Cope. I will comment on that later... but I am reading more and more about yoga and I well intend to come to everything mentionned in fortune's comments.  About the "four immeasurables": the fact that there is no "active god personality" in Buddhism, as fortune mentionned, is exactly the reason why, of all religions, Buddhism is the only one I want to consider. According to Buddhism, at the end of the day,  you  are making it all happen, and that's much more attractive to me than believing in a superior being whom you very well know never existed. The four immeasurables certainly is a vow that I am willing to take, for myself and for others. And I'm also looking forward to finding other interesting texts as this one.  Dilemma of the week: I found out at practice tonight that there will be a new meditation class on Wednesday nights, just before my regular hatha class. I've been wanting to take a meditation class for a while already, but the only one was on Fridays at 15:00, when I'm at work. But I really like working with my actual hatha teacher... what should I do? Give meditation a try, or stick with my teacher that works so well for me? Obviously, taking two classes one after the other would be a bit insane... I have a couple of weeks to think about it.

      Everything is easier after my 3-day workshop! I'm not kidding!  I went to the 18.00 class tonight, and everything went so much smoother than usual! All those little tricks I learned over the week-end really do work. They're really small details - like for instance, the way you work your tight muscles - and they make all the difference in the pose. It's unbelievable, I'm so excited.  Or maybe this was just a really good day. But I'd like to think it's the learning process. Guess it'll be verified tomorrow night. But tonight, for the first time, I managed to stay about 4 breaths in  urlLink Ustrasana  (which I've never been able to do before, partly because of the steel rods in my back) and I managed to do  urlLink Vasisthasana  better than ever before, although I'm still at the point where the foot of my upper leg rests on the ground in front of my hips.  I'm thinking I'll start practicing at the studio between 3 and 4 times a week in June, instead of waiting until September. I'll try to find out if it'll work out with the summer schedule.   I'm still on a cloud from this week-end's workshop.

      This week-end, I discovered a little marvel: a prayer that I actually like and felt like saying.  I'm not religious. I don't practice religion. I don't believe in any god. But I've always been attracted to Buddhism. Because I don't think it's a religion as such. It's a way of life. Buddhist don't care for trying to change people who are not buddists. They love everyone and everything. They will offer compassion to the person that only has hate to offer them. I think Buddhists have wonderful beliefs.  And so the teacher who was giving us this yoga workshop this week-end is converted to Buddhism. And he made us say that prayer, which I think I will adopt. Because it does not mention any god. It's just about live and respect of life, and that's the kind of message I'm looking for in what I read. I don't care for what a dude supposedly did 2,000 years ago. What I care for is how I should live my life today. And this prayer is a good example to follow:   May all beings have happiness and the causes of happiness; May all be free from sorrow and the causes of sorrow; May all never be separated from the sacred happiness which is sorrowless; And may all live in equanimity, without too much attachment and too much aversion, And live believing in the equality of all that lives.                       -traditional buddhist prayer

      A mini-garden within Julie's Garden.  I figured I might as well create a special section of my blog dedicated to yoga only. That way, I can talk about it all I want without annoying those who want to read my blog in general but couldn't care less about yoga.  Maybe this section of my blog won't have any visitors, or only few. It doesn't matter. This week-end's intensive workshop really brought up this passion I have for yoga, and I've decided to dedicate myself more deeply to the practice of yoga and living yoga.   So I'll use Julie's Lotus Garden to talk about my practice, talk about my discoveries about yoga, talk about the books I read, etc.  If no one visits it, at least it'll be a journal to document my evolution with this way of life and, if it is of no use to most people, at least it'll be a place for me to express my passion of yoga.  So grab a mat, sit down and close your eyes... oh wait! Don't. Otherwise you won't be able to read!   Drishti  right in front of you, on your computer screen, and watch the lotus grow.

       urlLink Setu Bandha Sarvangasana (Bridge pose)  is not really a difficult pose in itself. At least not for me. I actually enjoy it a lot, especially during several minutes, with a wooden block placed under my sacrum. Very relaxing, feels really good.       But because of my paralyzed ankle and the atrophied muscles of my right leg, I have a hard time not lifting my right heel off the floor. It's really difficult for me to actually push it into the ground. So for a couple of times, I've been putting a sand bag on my right feet to add some weight and force it to stay on the ground.  Today, we did Setu Bandha for 2 entire minutes, without a block to support ourselves. That's quite a long time for some people. I was afraid it would be to me. Well I'm glad to say that my breathing didn't change at all during those two minutes. It stayed really calm the whole time. I didn't have to take any break and I even started to get a feeling of pushing into the ground with my right foot.  It's just a beginning, but I'm on the right track. Of course, something like squatting is still absolutely impossible for me, but I'll get there eventually. Those muscles are beginning to stretch. The effects of yoga are amazing.

      As in  "It feels really good to be in class after an entire week" . It really does. I'm still at the point where I prefer being in class than practicing alone at home... I still learn so much, I prefer being in class and each time learn to push my limits forward a bit more.  So tonight was my first Anusara class. Basically, it's just Hatha yoga, with a different little prayer/chant at the beginning (well actually, the one we sometimes do in Hatha is just the Ashtanga one), and with a slightly different approach... But the biggest difference that I see, so far, is in the teacher, as it's someone I never had a class with (but I did the 3-day workshop with Hart Lazer with him a couple of weeks ago).  Anyways, so it was the first class of the summer semester, and there were a lot of people who had never done yoga before, so we saw the basic elements, mainly in standing up. Not very satisfactory for me, in a way (I'd really feel like doing a downward-facing dog just now, right next to the computer), because I was looking for more exercise than that, but at the same time, it's always good to review the basics and a different teacher also brings you a different approach, which helps you figure out some new things as well. So all in all, it's all good.  However, I am really looking forward to my usual Hatha class tomorrow... Hoping to get a little bit more action.  Ordered  urlLink Light on the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali by B. K. S. Iyengar  yesterday. I have tons of book to read, and I am reading many of them at the same time presently, but this should start my real pure yoga philosophy/history education... Whenever I find time to read it!

      Do you practice Ashtanga? Do you have a blog?   urlLink Ashtangi.NET  might be the kind of Ashtanga yoga community you would like to join. Created "for Ashtangis all over the world to have a central resource for blogs and other information about Ashtanga Yoga in the tradition of Sri. K. Pattabhi Jois," the people at Ashtangi.NET can even help you with your blog and host it for you. "Our content will be evolving to include articles, ashtanga yoga images and whatever else could be inspiring to the practice," promises the website.  My blog is only about yoga in general. I do not practice Ashtanga (I do Hatha and will start some Anusara tomorrow), so I can't join. But I thought it was a great idea and that I should plug it here, for the bloggers who would be interested. I'll keep checking it for great yoga resources.   urlLink

      ...going on yoga-wise. It's been almost a week since my last class, and I'm starting my new Anusara class tomorrow (finally!). Really looking forward to it.  But I added a bunch of new yoga blogs to the links, so feel free to visit those. Some are extremely interesting.    urlLink KJS Ashtanga Journal    urlLink alan little's weblog    urlLink Prana Journal    Also, read this article, about a  urlLink paraplegic man who became an amazing yoga teacher . Truly inspiring.  And as I posted on the blog that referred to this article ( urlLink Prana Journal ), having seen the effects of a few months of yoga on my own paralyzed ankle, I have no time believing the feelings this man managed to find through yoga.   I've said it before and I'll say it again: yoga is not for everyone, but if it  is  for you, you'll find the results to be absolutely surprising.

      My last yoga class was on Tuesday night, and the studio's closed for the week-end (today's Quebec's national holiday and they're taking the long week-end to move in and renovate the new studio... just across the hall!).  So that means I won't have my usual Friday night class and the next one will be on Tuesday, as the summer semester begins. I will then have my first Anusara yoga class. Looking forward to it and to seeing how different it is from Hatha.  But a complete week without a class is a long time! I know you shouldn't go to class every day and that class is only to learn but the real practice is when you're alone at home, but I like classes better.   I do practice at home, though. I only started feeling really confident enough to start practicing at home recently, but I try to do it maybe 6 days a week for at least an hour. So far so good. But I always look forward to the classes because that's when I learn more and push my limits farther. And I have the chance of practicing in a really small studio: it takes a maximum of 24 students (as opposed to some people practicing in classes where there are 50+ people, as I've read on some other blogs), and in summertime like right now, we're never really more than 15. So the teaching is very intimate and personal, the teachers have a lot of time for us and can answer all of our questions and that's great. I just love the whole atmosphere of the studio, almost familial, and I'm looking forward to the new semester starting next week, with my 4 classes a week.  Oh, and did I mention that I signed up for this 2-day ashtanga workshop in October? Program of the week-end:   Alignment and Balance in Standing Poses (Sat. am)  Aspects of the Primary Series (Sat. pm) Backbending Principles (Sun. am)   Inversions: Turning Upside Down (Sun. pm)  Looking forward to it, but it's still so far away!

      I've been practicing outdoors for two days, and I'm facing one problem:  In something as simple as sun salutations, when I extend my arms and look up at my hands, at the beginning or the end, I lose my balance because there is no more wall or ceiling to look at. Moving clouds or passing by bird make me lose my balance. Pretty stupid, but true. Same goes in  urlLink Utthita Trikonasana ,  urlLink Utthita Parsvakonasana  or  urlLink Vrksasana .  So I'm working on that... trying to look not as high as usual at first, trying to look at the inside of my elbow in Trikonasana or Parsvakonasana, instead of at a point higher up. But it's not easy.  But practicing outside also has its good sides. The wind, the fresh air, the singing birds. Love it.  Class tomorrow. Looking forward to it.   urlLink

      I don't have a class today, but the weather is so nice, I think I'll go practice outside in a while.  But I just discovered pictures online of this  urlLink  Yoga in paradise   trip that people from my studio take every year to the yoga retreat in Maya Tulum, Mexico. I had seen the pictures exposed at the studio, but not online.  So I'm sharing with you what paradise must be like, with this picture of my teacher Nicole doing  urlLink Utthita Parsvakonasana  on this awesome Mexican beach.     The whole bunch from  urlLink Yoga Monde  is going back there in next November. But I won't be going. Not that I don't want to. Au contraire, I'd love to. But it's extremely expensive, and between this one week yoga retreat and shorter, one week-end ones, I pick several one week-end ones. And I have to save my money for the teacher program that's gonna start next April. So yoga in Mexico will be for some other time, some other year. In the meantime, I just look at the pictures and dream... and I'll now go practice yoga in Saint-Constant (that is, in my backyard). Not as exotic, but the mat's the same in Mexico and Saint-Constant!

      Went to yoga class this morning, to make up for the class I missed last night (class was at 7 p.m., I left work at 6:15 p.m., got back home at 7 precisely and didn't have my stuff so I couldn't have gone directly to the studio).  I managed to push my limits a bit farther in a lot of poses, especially in  urlLink Marichyasana I  and  urlLink Paripurna Navasana .   Navasana's always been especially difficult for me, because of my back problems as well as my paralyzed ankle. I have a hard time not rounding the lower back, and raising the right foot. So I always did it like this:     I was never able to extend my arms in front of me, because then my lower back rolls and my right foot drops. I always struggled to even keep this position, so much that I got cramps in my abs while trying to stay put. But with practice, I've been getting better. And today, I managed to do it like this:     With just one slight difference: I keep my arms wrapped around my tighs. But I don't struggle so much anymore and I even manage to raise both of my feet higher. Proof that the muscles of my right leg are becoming stronger.  I am seeing a lot of improvement in a lot of poses lately. It's not much. Just a little thing at every class, but in the end, it makes the whole difference in the world and it makes me feel so good about myself. I used to never feel good about myself. Now I realize that, despite the cancer, the paralyzed ankle, the scoliosis and all the rest, I am very lucky to have such a great body and to be able to work it in such a way that I feel better about it every day.  I know that when you practice yoga, you have to keep your mind on yoga. You shouldn't compare yourself to others. But, being human, it's not easy to avoid comparison. Today, I was in an easier class than I usually take, with people who are better not as in shape, or maybe don't need such a hard workout. I was the one who went the farther in the poses, going through  urlLink Chaturanga Dandasana  in the Sun Salutations (while other people put their knees down), or wrapping my arms behind in Marichyasana while everyone else just kept holding their knee.  It's not a lot, and I know it's wrong to compare myself with others, but when I see that, I realize that my body isn't that bad and that I'm lucky, after all. It's not like I'm making myself feel better by putting others down or something. It's just that we have this saying, in French, that goes  "Quand on se compare, on se console." , which would go something like "When you compare yourself, your console yourself." And that's true.

      At tonight's class, we concentrated on backbends. Did 5 Surya Namaskar with a little bit of Vinyasa just to warm up, then concentrated on  urlLink Ustrasana  and different variations of  urlLink Urdhva Dhanurasana .  During my 3-day workshop with Hart Lazer in May, we practiced Urdhva Dhanurasana a lot. But the best I was able to do was come on the top of my heat and go up and down quickly maybe 3 times. I could never stay up and I was never able to push my arms straight.   Tonight, we practiced it with blocks against the wall moulding, to give our wrists an angle so it would be a bit easier. Well I was able to get about halfway up in the air. My main problem is with my right foot: like in a lot of poses, because of the paralysis and the weakness of the muscles, I have a hard time keeping my heel down the floor. The same goes in  urlLink Setu Bandha Sarvangasana , so of course it also happens in Urdhva Dhanurasana. But when the teacher came and just put a bit of pressure on my foot, the rest of my body lifted. Next time, I'll try with a sandbag on my right foot to keep it down. Maybe it'll help (since the teacher can't stay with me all the time!).  I made it only halfway, but I am extremely proud of myself and I know the other half will come sooner or later... maybe even sooner because I didn't expect to be able to do so much so soon.  In the meantime, I'll just be proud for my sister, who practices with me on Wednesday nights (although not as crazy about yoga as I am), who was doing it for the first time and managed to push herself all the way up on the first try. And that comes from a girl who says handstand are extremely difficult for her. I was so proud of her... it was almost as if I had done it myself!  So far this week I'm getting much farther than I've ever been. We'll see if it happens again on Friday.   urlLink

      Tonight, I accomplished something really small at my class, but of a huge importance for me: there is this pose we do, not sure it really has a name, but you just lay on your back, with a block in your back, just under your shoulder blades. Then you just rest the top of your head on the floor, relax your entire body and go deeper into the pose. It's a backbend... if there's a name for it, I'd like to find out.  Anyways, that is something I've never been able to do, because of the steel rods in my back. Backbends are not really easy for me and I found I was never able to follow the shape of a rectangular wooden block with my spine. Especially since the left bottom corner  always  gets into my skin, into my body, between my lower ribs, and it hurts like hell. So I did it with a blanket, but always with the small frustration (I know it's not right to get mad and not to accept your own body as it is, but this is one of the few things I really was upset about) that I couldn't do it with the block. And tonight, I was with a teacher I don't practice with often, and she suggested we throw a blanket on top of the block if it hurt. Just a simple blanket. And that makes the whole difference! And so for the first time before, I was able to get and stay into the pose for a good 10 breaths, with a block, covered with a blanket.  Just a proof that sometimes it's the really small details that matter.  Also, just at my second try, I'm really getting better with the  Marichyasana I  pose. Can't go really far ahead of me yet, but I'm getting the twist much better.   urlLink

      No matter how crappy I feel before a yoga class (and I often feel very crappy), I always end up feeling amazingly good. No matter how stressed out I am, I always come out of there feeling great.  Tonight, I came in so stressed that I could hardly breathe during the meditation at the beginning of the class. I was close to an anxiety attack, actually (get close to them a lot, rarely have them). Ten minutes into the class, I felt wonderful. Already. Guess I'm learning to deal with it better. Gotta start loving my body -- even the parts of it that are handicapped, in one way or another. If I start loving them, maybe they'll start feeling better.  Pose of the day:  Bakasana  (Crane Pose)   urlLink     I've known it for a long time, but never tried it until tonight. And I was surprised at how easy it actually is. But I have to say that my arms are the strong part of my body (as opposed to my legs). Just one thing though: my right leg (the handicapped one) doesn't "grip" the right arm enough, and I can't keep my right knee bent enough, so my foot actually touches the floor, making the pose less "successful".   But it was my first try... next time, I'll try to actually support my right foot up with my left foot by crossing my ankles. Gotta find tricks to help yourself when you have little physical problems like I do!

      That's the sound of me feeling so much better after doing yoga for the first time in 10 days.  I felt sick all week (with some sort of throat infection -- doesn't taste really good), and today for the first time I felt a bit better. And I really needed yoga anyways. 10 days is pretty much the longest I can go without it, I think. I'm an addict, I'm afraid.   But I was stupid enough to eat just an hour before the class, and eat really fast at that. I didn't eat much (just a croissant with ham and cheese), but I ate too fast, with the result that I felt like I was going to throw up, on top of all the rest.  So I did everything slowly, lightly. I hadn't practiced in 10 days anyways, so I was a bit stiff. But boy does it feel good! I feel so much better now!  I'm not really proud of myself because I panicked a bit, though. I didn't feel too good, my stomach really was upside down, and as I live all my emotions (good and bad but, of course, you notice the bad ones the most) in my belly and as I start panicking the minute I think I might get sick or something... well, I panicked. Hard to explain, but I just didn't feel good and when I feel like that, the only thing I can do is concentrate on the fact that I'm not feeling good. Stupid, but that's the way it is. And that's part of the reason why I'm doing yoga, and seeing an homeopath. Stupid anxiety problems.  Anyways, because of that, I couldn't really let go in  urlLink Savasana , unfortunately. I'm not proud of it but what can I do?   At least now I'm feeling much better, my whole body feels 10 pounds lighter or something. Back to the studio again to make up for Wednesday's missed class.

      I normally have a yoga class on Wednesday nights. But as I've been having a pretty bad sore throat since Monday morning and I really feel like my body is fighting a cold, I've decided not to go tonight, so I can go to bed around 9 p.m. (my class would actually finish at 9 p.m. and then, I'd be way too awake to go to bed).  There is this huge feeling of guilt that I'm feeling, because I miss yoga class (it's been a week because Dutchboy was in town for a couple of days) and because I just hate missing something I shouldn't have missed.  But I think it's a good decision. Going to bed early will allow me to go through this week without having to drag myself from one place to the other, and then I can go to class on Friday (as usual) and Saturday (to make up for tonight). Then, it doesn't matter as much if I don't feel too good because I don't actually have to go to work.  I'll go  read  about yoga now, then...

      My heart is broken. It really is. Céline, who was my first yoga teacher and one of the two whose teaching has brought me the most, will not be back at our studio in September. She lives on the Plateau, in Montreal, and we're on the South Shore. Too far for her, and her schedule was already too busy. I know I am so going to cry on her last class. That's how much I enjoy her teaching.  Tonight, she taught us a new way of getting the legs up in Handstand, with the help of a partner. You just put your hands on the ground and lift one leg. The partner holds your foot up, and you push against their hand, inward. Like that, your foot which is on the floor just raises up in the air. Almost like it's flying.  When she explained the pose, she looked at me (knowing my physical condition) and said "I'm going to help you. You  will  do the pose." To which I replied "I have absolutely no doubt of it." People thought it was really funny. But the truth is my body may be all messed up, I totally trust my teachers when they tell me to do one thing, and I just know it'll work. And it totally did. She was extremely impressed. And so was I. It was even much easier than I thought it would be. But I'm good with handstands in general. And I love them.   At the end of the class, she thanked us for trusting her and willing to try the crazy things she wants to teach us. She said she was impressed at how our group had evolved since September, and that we were great.   When I left, I stopped by the ladiesroom, and when I came out, she was standing there talking with the studio owner. She looked at me and repeated how amazed she was that I could do it easily, and said that I really didn't have any problem with my leg; it's only my foot, really. She said that both legs were equally strong and that she was really impressed.  Always good to hear, and good for a self-confidence boost. But I know I couldn't achieve those things without a great teacher like her. She really is fantastic. So if you live in Montreal and are looking for a great teacher, go to one of Céline's classes at  urlLink Ashtanga Montréal  or  urlLink Lyne St-Rock's studio . She truly is an amazing teacher. I'll have to find a way to go to one of her classes once in a while, even if it is way out of my way.

      Today was a pretty stressful day. We were receiving Jeb Bush (G. W. Bush's brother) for a business luncheon and I was in charge of greeting all the medias, and there was a lot of tension at work. Plus I'm due for my homeopathy remedy (I have an appointment tomorrow) because I've been extremely anxious for the past month or so...   Tonight's Anusara class was just what I needed. We did Sun Salutations but in a different order with some different poses in between, which made it weird at first, but that much more difficult... and difficult is good. At least when I'm stressed out and I need to release all the energy.   We did a lot of restorative poses at the end, like  urlLink Supta Baddha Konasana &nbsp;and  urlLink Viparita Karani , then we did Savasana, in which I fell into a&nbsp;semi-sleep. I was very relaxed. I really enjoyed it. Then we did a 5-minute meditation to close the class. I think that's my favorite part of Anusara classes: Savasana, then meditation. It always helps me feel so much better, no matter what state I'm in.   Hatha tomorrow... Last class of the week, as  urlLink Dutchboy  (who&nbsp;visits me once a month until he can move here permanently so we can be together)&nbsp;is arriving for the week-end on Thursday night, so we'll be in our little world for 4 days.

      Well, I'm not an Ashtanga virgin anymore. Went to my first class tonight, and I think it went pretty well. At times I wished we had a break so I could wipe the sweat off my face, eyes, back, chest (everywhere, basically!), and I have to say that I was rather shaky in  urlLink Chaturanga Dandasana  during the vinyasa between sitting poses, but I really enjoyed the experience and definitely count on returning next Monday.   I think I will always be faithful to Hatha because it teaches you how to do the poses right and I really need that with my messed up body (I already knew all the poses in Ashtanga and even the order of the poses because we pretty much do the same thing in Hatha, just more slowly and for a longer time in each pose), but Ashtanga once a week may definitely be an added bonus of energy, much needed in my weeks anyways. I was even able to do the elevated lotus pose ( Utthita Padmasana , I think?)!   All in all, loved the experience, though it's definitely tiring, but hey, I'll definitely go for more!

      After my meditation class on Wednesday night, I went to bed pretty late. I stayed up cooking muffins (I never cook, go figure!), cleaning the house and reading. Woke up tired and with a headache yesterday morning. Didn't take anything, as I don't like taking medication and only do so when it's really needed. But by the end of the afternoon, the headache was even worse, and I had plans for the evening: I was meeting with my best friend, whom I hadn't seen in 6 months because life&nbsp;got in the way,&nbsp;for dessert and I didn't want to cancel although my head was really hurting. So I took some Advil migraine at the end of the afternoon.   I left my friend's place at 1 a.m., having had an excellent evening, but with the worst headache in the world. At 1:15 I was in bed with 2 Tylenols. Because when you go to bed with a headache, you wake up with a headache. And I did! All day, I was having the same horrible headache. Took 2 Tylenols in the morning, and another Advil in the afternoon.   Then I went to yoga class tonight. I didn't feel like it because I was tired and felt so sick, but I needed it and I thought it would help me. I was a bit worried though that it was going to be a difficult class because my Friday night teacher (the one I like so much) teaches difficult routines. So I got there, and my usual teacher wasn't there. And I was a bit relieved. The teacher who replaced her is a bit smoother in her classes, and I needed that tonight.   Class went extremely well, and I had a lot more energy than I expected. I was able to do  urlLink Chaturanga  properly (last Friday we worked a lot on Chaturanga, discovering that most of us - including me - didn't do it right) and the routine we did was just what I needed, with more poses on the floor (backbends, and leg stretchs with a belt) than standing.   Came out of there in greater shape than I haven't been in a week, and the headache is gone!

      I'm not too proud of myself. I went to meditation class tonight, because it's the "constructions holidays", as we call them here in Quebec (most people being on vacation this and next week), and so there would be less people in the class (meditation class is always packed and so that's why I didn't officially subscribe to it this semester), knowing there would be room for me and that it would be good for me, considering I've been having a few pretty stressful weeks.   The thing is I'm having my period, and today is my "big day", i.e. the one day with the floating headache, never really there and never really going away, the tummy being all weird and all upside down, the pain in the lower back and the legs... the whole package, basically. So I went to class, not being very nervous (as I mentionned before, I am a very anxious person and am prone to panick attacks), and feeling good enough to sit, with a friend, completely opposite to the door (which I almost never do).   Big mistake. Or well, maybe the class would have been awful had I been sitting next to the door, but it certainly didn't help. My whole body felt like crap, I was having cramps and pains, and I couldn't concentrate much on the meditations, being too busy anguishing about being away from the door. Stupid, stupid, stupid. I go to meditation class to learn to deal with my anxiety and my panick attacks, and the whole time, I'm on the verge of having one of them.   Actually, although I can't say I had a good time, I do think the class was beneficial to me. I think it's normal that all this stuff, all the dirt comes up while meditating. At the beginning, we did the  urlLink Meta Meditation , which I had never done before and which I thought felt a bit weird at first. We went around the class and repeating it for every single person attending:     Julie, may you be safe from inner and outer harm,  Julie, may you be happy and peaceful of heart,  Julie, may your body be healthy and strong,  Julie, may my life be filled with ease.     &nbsp;  It definitely felt weird. But good weird. Or weird good. Anyways, it did me good. After saying it for everyone attending, we said it for people we knew who hurt us, for people we barely know but to whom we wish good, etc. I was doing pretty good. Then Nicole said  "Now, visualize the person you love the most in this world. Say it for them."  So I visualized my boyfriend whom, in a nutshell, lives in Europe, 5,000 miles away from, and with whom I've been having a long-distance relationship, seeing him once a month, until we can live together in the same country (which is going to be soon since he's been accepted by Quebec immigration), for the past 4 years. My eyes filled with tears and the tears went down my cheeks, I just couldn't control it. It's like, all the emotions that I've learned to deal with for the past 4 years all came up at the same time... Lots of emotions.  &nbsp;

      Madonna's in Toronto these days; her first time in Canada in eleven years. And she's skipping Montreal this time.  &nbsp;  Last time she was here, I was in my hospital bed, completely drugged up with morphine after my 2nd scoliosis surgery. I hated knowing that she was in the same city as me and that I couldn't see her.  &nbsp;  Right now, I hate knowing that she's in the same country as me and that I can't see her. One of my colleagues was in Toronto last night for her concert. My colleague is not the biggest Madonna fan in the world, but she had the connection for cheap tickets, so she went. Today, she said that this was the greatest show she'd ever seen. Jealousy is not a nice feeling, but today I was terribly jealous. To me, Madonna can do nothing wrong (besides cinema, maybe). She can do just whatever she likes, it's ok because she's Madonna. I absolutely love her.  &nbsp;  Now, why am I talking about Madonna on this blog? This is a yoga blog, after all.  &nbsp;  Because of this:        &nbsp;  Apparently, she can do it just like this. *snap of fingers*  &nbsp;  It's as easy as that for her.  &nbsp;  Or this, from her tourbook:        &nbsp;&nbsp;  I know that for a lot of Ashtangis, these are easy ones. For the beginner that I am, it looks almost impossible. I mean, with my weak leg and my fused back, I am starting to be able to lift myself in  urlLink Urdhva Dhanurasana . And because of my fused back, I can hardly touch my heels in  urlLink Ustrasana , let alone go completely into the pose like this!  &nbsp;  Or maybe I'm just easily impressed. Either way, to me Madonna's the most amazing singer/entertainer, and&nbsp;she's also a great yogi... I can only hope I can be as bendy as she is and look as great as she does&nbsp;when I'm 45! In the meantime, I'll just be happy with my newly born yoga arms (most people can't see them, but I can!&nbsp;Haha!)...&nbsp;

      One of my greatest yoga lessons happened tonight. Not during class, but after it. &nbsp; I stayed after everyone left because all week I have been doing a small PR project for the yoga studio (something that will come out in a couple of weeks and that I could probably talk about here because it'll be in French and located in Quebec only, but since it's still a secret, I won't mention it here either, although it's burning my lips because it's a yoga project and it's so interesting), and I wanted to show my work to my teacher, whom I'm doing this for. &nbsp; Now, this is the teacher I mention last week, the one who amazed me so much and brought me so much every time&nbsp; I practiced with her. Well tonight, by talking with her, I found out even more about her and wow, I now know where she's coming from (and it ain't pretty), I can only imagine everything she's gone through, and I can only feel even more humbled when I know why she's really doing all of this. I can only admire even more, knowing that she's doing all of her teaching, giving up her other career and everything else just so she can share this discipline which brought her so much with others and be satisfied if she has the smallest effect on their lives.  &nbsp; Really, some of the greatest yoga lessons don't take place on a mat. Sometimes, it's just by talking with someone who's overcome a huge challenge and litterally changed her life - and saved it - with yoga. &nbsp; Makes me want to keep investing myself in yoga even more.

      What a strange class tonight! You know, one of those classes when nothing goes right, and it seems to be like that for all students in the class?  For me, it started from the very beginning, when I couldn't even sit comfortably on my feet, my knees bent, to do the arms of  urlLink Gomukhasana  and such poses.  Then we did  urlLink Bharadvajasana I  and the teacher made us twist on the wrong side at first. Then, she kept making us do every pose starting with the left side, while we are used to doing the right side first. It seems stupid, but it will really throw you off!   Everybody (including me) seemed tired and was having trouble after the 3rd Sun Salutation. At my request, we did handstands afterwards, but everyone was too tired to do it properly. I kept doing stupid moves that made me feel uncomfortable in every pose I took.   So we ended up doing  urlLink Supta Baddha Konasana  for a long time (and I almost fell asleep), then  urlLink Savasana  (and I almost fell asleep).  There are days like that... And now I'm so tired, I'll go and fall asleep.

      Tonight, at the Anusara class, we did  urlLink Savasana  for a good 15 minutes. Then, we did a 10-12 minute meditation. Amazing. I haven't been so relaxed in a long time.  Usually, we do Savasana for many 10 minutes, and that's it. We don't do much meditation in the Hatha classes: just a few minutes to calm down our minds and get into the "yoga mood" at the beginning of the class.  I know I should meditate more at home. That was actually my New Year resolution in last January, but you know how it goes. I've been thinking a lot lately that I should take a meditation class to help me with stress management. But the meditation class was at the same time as one of my Hatha classes that I enjoy a lot, with a teacher that I like a lot, and so I didn't want to drop that class. Now I'm starting to think that, in September, if the meditation class and my Hatha class both stay at the same time, I should go to meditation for a while. I really need it.  So tonight was just a preview of how much good it would do me. After less than 30 minutes of Savasana and meditation, I felt more relaxed than I haven't been in a long time.   Gotta find a way to get that feeling back more often.

      One of the things you are supposed to learn through yoga and the whole spiritual practice is tolerance.   Yesterday, in class, the woman next to me didn't follow the marks on the floor and put her mat wherever she wanted: directly in line with mine. This resulted in our arms banging into each other's during the Sun Salutations,  and  she gave me one of these looks, as if  I  was the one in her way.   That completely irritated me and pissed me off. I got sick of it and moved my mat back, since I had a bit of room. But that ruined the whole thing for me. I was in a really crappy mood. And I knew I shouldn't be, I knew I should let it go, but I just couldn't do it.   My personal space is something really important to me. As soon as a stranger gets too close, in my "bubble", I get irritated. I know that I should work with yoga to just accept these things and let them go, not caring about them, but yesterday it didn't work. I'm not proud of it, I got pissed off inside of me, but never showed it, and so I was the only one suffering from that anger and that's just stupid.  Sometimes, the mental work of yoga is just more difficult than the physical one.   urlLink

      Anyone has had one of those?  Since I started yoga in last September, I met quite a couple of teachers, some that I loved, too. But there is this one teacher who, to me, is very special. Almost like magic. Every time I'm in one of her classes - and even if her classes are usually the most difficult classes of all - something happens that makes me think there is really something special about that woman.  Usually, it's a pose I've been trying to do with difficulty for a while that I get to do very easily because of the way she explained it. The difference is just in the words she uses, and in the way she says them. So tolerant, so peaceful, so meaningful and so personal. She really knows to use the best words and to say them in a comforting tone.   Most of my greatest achievements, I've made them in her class. She always succeeds in making me discover a part of me that I didn't know. I strenght that I didn't know I had, or a serenity I ignored was in me.   Tonight's class (advanced Hatha) was extremely difficult. But also very detoxifying. Lots of sweating (maybe a bit too much -- it's not much fun when the sweat comes down in your eyes!), and now it feels great. But I was nervous. Stressed out. I should have been really restless in Savasana. Because it's my general state of mind, lately. But yet, I managed to get more relaxed than I haven't been in a long time. Just because of her soothing words, and the way she tells us to accept our body and how we feel in it.  Maybe she's just a really gifted teacher, born to do what she does. But for me she's like a lucky charm and I'm so happy I found someone who helps me so much. I hope every yoga student has the chance to find such a great teacher.

      I am a very anxious person. I worry a lot, I stress out a lot, but I also suffer a lot from anxiety, and that's even worse. I'm prone to panick attacks, too. They tend to be triggered by a feeling of being trapped. For instance, in meetings or when I was at school, I would always choose a seat that was near the door -- from where the exit would be easy to reach,  just in case .   I'm not claustrophobic per say, because I don't have a problem with small rooms and elevators, for instance, but if I'm in a very crowded room and the exit is far from me, I will suffer from a lot of anxiety, and I have even had panick attacks in a few occasions. Having to run out of a meeting with no apparent reason, just because I can't breathe anymore and I'm feeling sick and all dizzy... all this because I'm feeling trapped. This only happened once or twice, but the anxiety is always there, at some level.  So, that's one of the reasons I started doing yoga. Not the only one, but one of them: dealing with stress and anxiety. And, of course (no one will be surprised there), it has proven to be extremely helpful. However, I do have bad days. On those days, I place my mat near the door,  just in case . On those days, sometimes, I can't relax at all in  urlLink Savasana . It's like the fact of stopping all activity bring my attention and focus even more on the physical expression of that anxiety. For me, everything happens in the digestive system, and mostly the belly. If I get anxious, it'll feel tight and just really uncomfortable, and my mind tend to really pay attention to that in Savasana. I just keep thinking about getting up and leaving the room, but most of the time I don't. Actually, I remember doing it only once in Savasana. My mind just keeps running and running, imagining the worst scenarios (what the hell  could  happen anyways, I don't know... but that's what anxiety is like. Apparently, part of it would come from the radiotherapy treatments when I was a kid... The feeling of being trapped and everything.). I just can't calm down.  Now, like I said, that doesn't happen all the time, but sometimes it does, and it's been happening a lot lately (I've just been more stressed out, in general, for the past month or so, with work being so crazy and everything). We now have a new classroom at the studio. A second one, much smaller. People practice closer to each other, because of the set-up. And there is a spot very near the door, almost blocking it.  Today was a bad day for me. Very stressful. When I came in at class, the only spots left were near the door. I didn't mind, although I might have tried and gone for a farther one if I had had the choise. But then we started working with the wall, and somebody installed their mat just behind the door, blocking it. During practice, I was fine, because I knew it wouldn't really be a problem if I had to get out; the person could just easily move and get back to their mat. But I was really hoping that they'd get away from the door in Savasana.  Of course, they didn't. So I expected to have an awful Savasana, badly stressing out. Well I didn't. I was able to relax a lot, to the point of almost falling asleep. Just before Savasana, we did some Prana exercises, and they went much better for me than usual. I tend to have a very short breath and after like 5 seconds of breathing in, I just can't take it anymore. But tonight, I was able to climb up to breathing in for 10 and breathing out for 8 without any problem. Maybe that's what helped me calm down, because with the kind of day I had, I  should  have been anxious during Savasana.  One more proof that yoga is more complex than just the physical poses and has effects way beyond the body...

      Had my Anusara class tonight.  As I mentionned last week, there are a lot of beginners in this class, so we are reviewing a lot of the yoga basics, but I did manage to do something extremely difficult for the first time tonight! That is, standing in  urlLink Ardha Chandrasana  on my right leg!   urlLink       For the readers who don't know, in a nutshell, I had cancer when I was a kid, which left me with a partly paralyzed right ankle and a right foot pointed towards the outside (instead of having the toes pointing right in front). The arch of my foot is non-existant, too. So standing poses are quite challenging for me, and Ardha Chandrasana is one of the most difficult of all.   When I first started doing yoga last September, I couldn't even start lifting my left foot from the floor in that position. I would just lose my balance. Then, after a couple of months of trying, I managed to lift my foot a bit and stand on my bent, shaking right leg. But that was already an improvement. After a couple more months, I would be able to completely extend my leg for a little while before I lost my balance. I was also able to start opening my hips and turning my whole body as you should do in Halfmoon. But tonight, I managed to do both and keep the position for quite a while! Of course at some point I lost my balance and couldn't repeat it, but it doesn't matter: I know that I can do it. And this time I wasn't shaking at all! It's just a matter of understanding where I should put my weight on that weirdly-functioning leg and, of course, a matter of time.  I shouldn't be so surprised because I was convinced of the miracles yoga could perform a while ago already, but it's always so exciting to discover that my limits are not really limitations... They're just walls I have to learn to climb.

      Is the most difficult thing I ever tried to do, I think.  Today, after work, I went for my second massage ever. I believe I've mentionned before that I was a very nervous person, prone to anxiety attacks. Therefore, going for a massage is something that really makes me nervous: being naked on a table, alone in a room with a stranger. Who wouldn't be?   So why do I go then? Exactly for this reason: I need to release stress, I know to relieve my anxiety, and I can do that by practicing yoga, taking care of myself... going for a massage. It's a stressful situation I need to tame, not avoid.  How was I feeling while I was laying there? At first, I was ok. Then I started being cold. My fingers and my toes were extremely cold. I started shaking a bit, probably because of the cold. Soon enough, my entire body was shaking and I couldn't control it. My legs, my arms, my hands. Everything was shaking. Slightly, but I could feel it, and Nancy, the massage therapist, could feel it too. It came from the core, from the middle of my body, from my stomach. Third chakra. Nothing surprising to me.  Of course my first reaction was to try to control it, try to stop, and getting mad at myself for stressing out. I was safe, Nancy knows I have a problem with anxiety, I should just let it go, because we're both there to absorb it anyways. I was frustrating, and wanting to cry.  Then I thought... I knew it wasn't exactly going to be fun when I went there. I mean, a massage is supposed to be nice, except that I knew I was going to be very anxious. Yet, I went anyways. This is a learning curve. This falls in the same category as my yoga practice, and my meetings with an homeopath: I want to work on the problem and learn to deal with my anxiety, until it turns into something positive. It's ok to be shaky. It's only my second massage ever, after all. If anything, it's normal. I can't expect things to be oh so nice and so comfy and so relaxing on my second appointment. I most certainly can't expect them to be like that, being aware of my major anxiety problem. I have to be realist. I have to be tolerant and feel compassion towards myself. Bit by bit, I'll learn to be less and less stress out while I receive a massage, and some day, it will be all nice and comfy and relaxing.  Nancy was very attentive to my needs and she managed to relax me through the massage. We chatted a little bit towards the end, which actually helped me get to know her better and relax. In the last 10 minutes or so, I was totally fine, to the point that I was surprised when she told me it was already over.  I have to admit most of the 1 hour of the massage wasn't exactly fun. But I'm glad I went, and it was beneficial to me. I have a massage therapist who is very understanding and attentive, I know I can trust her, she knows how difficult it was for me to go back, yet she really appreciates it and is willing to work with me, and so I will go back. Because this is therapy for me.  My initial reaction, after such an experience, would be to be upset and mad at myself. Tonight, I'm not. I'm proud I went, I'm proud I was able to talk about it with my therapist, and I'm actually proud I went through it with at least a hint of relaxation. I'll definitely go back. I know I'll be nervous when I do, but I will.

      Went to my Hatha class tonight... only to find out that it was going to be an Anusara class!  My regular Hatha teacher is away on a training somewhere in B.C., and the replacing teacher is certified in Anusara, so we had an Anusara class. I had never practiced with this teacher before, although I had been a student in a workshop where she was also a student, and I had an excellent surprise!  I absolutely loved her dynamism and her way of putting things. Very energetic, and very funny. Great class, learned quite a bit about the Anusara school of yoga, and I enjoyed it very much.   I'm thinking I may take a regular Anusara class with her in September... She'll be there for the next two Wednesdays as well, so we'll see how it goes.

      I have been getting more comments to my posts lately, and I wanted to say a big thank you to everyone who dared commenting on my posts!  I'm still new about the whole yoga practice, although very passionate about it, and I have so much to learn. It's really great to read your comments and insights and learn more through them.  So Roy and Julie, thanks a lot for your comments (Julie, I think you're right on the adjustment thing... The teacher's adjustments yesterday definitely helped me lenghten in Prasarita Padottanasana and in Janu Sirsasana, for instance... Too bad I couldn't keep it that way when she let go!)...   Everyone else, please do not hesitate to post your comments and say what's on your mind. I learn from them as much as from the classes!  That's what's so fantastic about the yoga blogs... You get to read about others' experiences, and that helps your in your own practice!

      Tonight was my second ever Ashtanga class, and 50 minutes after the end of the class, I'm still kinda shaky.   Class was a bit difficult. I was sick yesterday, a bit tired today, not feeling too in shape tonight, but I went to class anyways because I always come out of there feeling awesome. And, of course, I do feel awesome now.  We had a semi-private class: only 4 other students showed up! So the teacher was able to spend a lot more time on each of us, and that's always great... although a bit depressing when you think you're doing a pose right, and she comes and adjusts you, and you feel the difference in your muscles, and you go "Riiiiight.  That's  what it should feel like!". Ok, depressing isn't the right word. But you know what I mean. You're all proud because you think you're doing this pose especially well, then you find out you're all wrong. Kinda bursts your bubble, doesn't it? But hey, I'm in class to learn, and so I'm learning and enjoying it a lot!  We practiced  urlLink Salamba Sarvangasana , a particularly difficult one for me. But then I realized that,  this one , I'm not doing so back. Of course, there's an angle between my body and my legs, as straightening that part of my body is the most difficult (also in  urlLink Setu Bandha Sarvangasana , and having my face that close to my chest really makes me see the curve in my spine (from the scoliosis) and of course that's not something I like to have my face rubbed in (literally!), but at least I'm not doing it so bad and that's good!  Class with Cynthia was fantastic, as usual, and she's one of those teachers who likes to adjust students a lot, and I benefit immensely from that.   So there, Ashtanga exhausts me, but I'm loving it!

      Okay, so what do you do on a Saturday night when you're depressed because you hate your job, you have a paper to write and don't feel like doing it, and you can't be with the most important person in your life because they're away?  Answer: you stay home and watch  Santa Clause II !!!  Okay, so my sister saw some Christmas cartoon on TV and felt like watching a Christmas movie. So she went to the video store and got that movie. I was like "Oh no... Not a Tim Allen movie!" because well, Tim Allen ruled in  Home Improvement  but his movies usually suck. But it was cute and funny and entertaining...  Oh man... I must be a sad pathetic loser, watching Tim Allen movies on a Saturday night and actually enjoying them!   Don't tell anyone I liked it, ok?   .

      I'm a new-born yogi. A 3-month old yogi. I like being a yogi. Yogis do yoga.   I went to my Hatha yoga class this morning. Let me tell you, for a Saturday morning, it was nothing but relaxing. Try standing up like this for 10 minutes.      NOT easy.  But once you succeed, it feels very good. But for now, I'm exhausted... I'd need a nap to recover from yoga... whereas people usually do yoga to recover from the rest. Go figure.  I do NOT have time for a nap, however. Got a 20-page paper to write this weekend... Gotta get started on that. Maybe I'll write it while standing on one leg!?

      Okay, so I just saw this cool international movie... everyone will find something good in it. It's called  L'auberge espagnole  in French... or  Euro Pudding  in international English... or  Pot Luck  in English Canada... or  Una Casa de Locos  in Spanish... or  The Spanish Inn   and   The Spanish Apartment  in the USA. Something for everyone, I'm telling you!  Cool French movie about a dude who goes to study to Barcelona (Spain) for a year. He ends up moving in with 6 other students from all over the place (Germany, England, Italy, Switzerland, etc.) in this  piso  (apartment)... Very funny, very multicultural... something that I really identify with.  So yeah... a cool foreign movie, easy to watch even for those who don't like foreign movies!  Bring the list of possible titles to the video store with you!

      Hi there!  This is my new blog!  Everybody seems to have a blog nowadays, so I thought "Why don't I have a blog?".  It's free, it's easy, and I have a LOT to tell about... mostly complaining.    So here, welcome to Julie's Garden!

Started working on this pose:    Ustrasana : Camel Pose Quite a challenge when you have two steel shafts in your back!  Also did that thing most people hate: work.

      Okay, so where did the weekend go?  I know! In my 20-page paper!  But it's done now... I don't want to talk about it anymore. Oh, wait... I'll have to talk about it again, as I'll have to write part 2 next weekend! But at least for now it's over. So is my weekend.  Back to work this morning. Not that I want to. But ah, there's only 3 weeks left before the (very much needed) holidays. I'll start counting the days.  Busy week coming up: thai dinner with best friend tonight, happy hour with collegues tomorrow (collegues who do the same work as I would like to do for other companies, not collegues from my workplace), yoga on Wednesday night, nothing on Thursday night (!!!) and... paper next weekend!!! Argh... let's not think too far ahead, alright?  Have a nice week everyone... I hope no one gets a case of the Mondays!

We'll see (once again) how talented Kim is at jumping both feet into trouble.  And well, I don't know what else to say. I'm totally emptied of my energy. Because of what I can't tell you about.

      Yes! Finally! 2 weeks off!!!  Well, not entirely, as I have to work in store on Monday and Tuesday (I work in the marketing department of the head office of a cosmetics company... working at counter, just for fun, the last two days before Christmas) but that's gonna be fun and relax and it's not "real work".  So YES!!!! VACATION TIME!!! *doing the dance of joy*  Well, actually, that leaves me not knowing what to do with my free time, believe it or not!  Went to my last yoga class before the holidays this morning...   Pose of the day:  Paripurna Navasana  (the boat pose)     Try it and feel the pain in your abs!  Then went to Wal-Mart to buy a couple of things... panicked when I saw the immense parking lot full of cars, simply turned around when I got inside and saw the endless line up at cashier.   Came home, relaxed a bit, just finished watching  Ciné-Cadeaux ... Every year, at Christmas time, for about two weeks, every night at 18.30, a classic movie that everyone - young ones and not so young ones - loves seeing over and over again is shown on this French Quebec national TV station... Tonight was the first, with  Astérix Le Gaulois . Classic cartoon, produced in 1968, still amazing and hilarious to this day. Gotta see Astérix at least once a year! Can't wait to see the classic  Astérix et Cléopâtre  again!     With the 50+ cm of snow some areas of Quebec have been getting this past week, ski must be amazing... Might be going tomorrow...

      Thank god!  Between work, school, Christmas shopping and political battles on the forum (Yes! I'm happy that Hussein was captured! But no! Bush is not the new messiah!), there isn't much that is actually fun.  Looking forward to getting more than two days in a row off, sleeping as much as I want, spending time with my boyfriend and eating tons of unhealthy food.  In the meantime, while shopping today, I came across this very funny line for anyone who does yoga (and anyone who doesn't even more, I guess): "Did you ever notice that Om is just Ow upside down?"    The Sanskrit sign for Om

      On another note, this is a busy day for me.  This afternoon, I have a conference by  "Les Grands Explorateurs" ... "Les Grands Explorateurs" (translated "The Great Explorers") are a bunch of video-conferences given all through the year, by people who travelled to exotic countries, made movies about the people living there and bring it back here to talk about it. So the film maker presents his movie and, in the same way as a documentary you'd watch on TV, narrates a story... The difference is that the narrator is doing it, live on stage. That makes for very interesting documentaries, if you like travelling and are interested in foreign cultures.  So earlier this year, I saw a conference about Laos-Cambodgia-Vietnam, there was also one about Portugal... Today is  Istanbul .    Should be very interesting.  I also have to finish my term paper (almost there!)...  And tonight is my family Christmas dinner!  Yes, you heard it well... 10 days in advance. My dear parents love us so much that they decided they don't mind spending Christmas away from us, so we have to celebrate today. Fun, eh?

         What can I say? He has an amazing voice, an amazing repertoire, lots of sex appeal and just knows how to please the crowd.   The most impressive concert I've ever seen. The man's a legend and to still sing and look that good after 40 years in a world of excess as we know it, is something in itself.  Really liked him before, LOVE him now.  Some will say he's a hasbeen... well, I'll just say I don't mind encouraging the hasbeen industry!

Haven't done yoga in a week... it's the only thing I miss during those holidays.    My resolution for 2004? Do a minimum of 5 minutes of meditation every day.

Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!  To everyone who's celebrating the holidays and hating it... Do like me next year: ignore it. First time and LOVING it.  To everyone who's not celebrating... have a nice, ordinary day.  Back to watching the 12th Friends episode of the day... Isn't it amazing to not be doing anything and actually feeling good about it?!

      Another day of doing nothing. I could get used to that.  We're less than a week from the end of the holidays... Anybody else like that? Instead of enjoying the days of vacation left, I'm getting depressed counting them and dreading the day that I have to return to work. That's so NOT a positive attitude!  Alright, let's flip the coin... YAY!!! 6 entire days of vacation left 'til I gotta go back to work!!!   But then again, yesterday I had  7 . Argh!  On another note, anybody here dances salsa? I think I will start a class in January... Been wanting to do it for a long time already, but never did because my boyfriend definitely won't dance with me. I guess that cuban music doesn't rock enough for his taste... But then again, if I keep myself from taking salsa classes just because I have to go alone, then I'll never learn to dance, right? Is it worth going alone? Has anybody else ever done it? Help me decide!

If you read French or would like to try yourself at it, and are interested in my Def Leppard papers, then you can download them  urlLink here  and  urlLink here .  Please send me your comments!  The teacher's comments on the last paper:  Excellent paper! - The comparison was not easy, but you were able to highlight the central elements of the analysis. - The reflexion is very relevant. - Your questionnaire brings out some very interesting questions. It could be worth compiling all the informations. Congratulations!

      And they're very positive!  I got my second Def Leppard paper back this week... For the first one, I had gotten a mark of 41/45, which is very good. I expected the second one to be rather sucky, since I had a hard time finishing it. I had a LOT of DL survey material, but I also had to compare the case with 3 other cases, in totally unrelated fields. I did as well as I could, but I really thought the teacher wouldn't like it.   Well... A got a mark of 29/30!!!  So, my friends, I am finishing this class with a A+, thanks to you all, and to Def Leppard.  Actually, it's the second time Def Leppard is giving me a A+ in university! Sad, or pretty cool?  So,  I'd like to thank everyone who participated in the survey. Without your help, there would have been no paper... and no A+ on my report card! Thanks again and again.   I will be translating the papers in the next few months... Please allow me some time. I still have another class to take, and those papers are 20 pages each. But I won't forget!

      Question: How can you tell when a girl has no life?  Answer: When the highlight of her week is her yoga class.  But hey! I am so happy yoga has started again! :-D  I really enjoyed the holidays and taking a break from everything but yoga is something I'd do every day, 8 hours a day, if I could. I wish I could get paid for practicing yoga. Wouldn't that be cool?!  You'll think I could become a yoga  teacher  and that would do it... But first of all, I'm a newbie. You can't teach yoga unless you're certified with 500 hours of practice, or something. Plus, I wear a leg brace on my right leg, similar to  urlLink this   and  I have steel rods along the sides of my spine because I have a scoliosis. (For more info on scoliosis, click  urlLink here .) Because I had a spine fusion, I'm not as flexible as most people.   So yeah, becoming a teacher is out of the question. Wish I could, but I can't. Probably never will. But I  can  do yoga, very well at that... better than some normal people, actually. I'm physically challenged, but I'm lucky enough to have always been talented in sports... within my personal limits, of course.  Anyways, I'll just keep practicing it twice a week. These moments are the only moments in my life (there is one other moment, but I won't get into details... you can try to guess...) when I don't think about anything else but the present moment. I guess you could say I really found "my thing".  Ok, enough yoga talk for tonight... Gotta go do... stuff.   Pose of the day: Vasisthasana (Side Plank Pose)

      Is tonight, of course. Back to work tomorrow, after almost two weeks of vacation.   You spend two weeks doing nothing (or partying in some cases), eating tons of unhealthy foods in any case (and being sick from it because your body is used to healthy food), relaxing and releasing the stress, little by little.   Then, tonight comes, and you know that tomorrow, the stress will be back, and you'll be wishing for the next holidays just as much as you were wishing for them 15 days ago. This has got to be the most depressing night of the year!  Well, the good news is that I will be completely redecorating my bedroom next weekend, and that's gonna be fun.  I need to pick new colors for my walls, now. I want something calming and soothing, zen and meditative. Some whites and some neutral colors. My new decor will be very pure, very simple. Nothing to do with the total mess that used to be my bedroom for years, until a couple of days ago when I threw away almost everything. What a difference!  So tomorrow, during lunch, I'll go to the hardware store to get some color samples... Gotta have something to motivate me to get through the horrible work day! Speaking of which... anybody actually like what they do for a living and look forward to going back to work? Is it naive to think that some day I might actually be doing something that I enjoy? Hope not... It's got to get better than this.  Well anyways... good luck dealing with that  case of the Mondays ...

      As you can see, my garden is now green.  Some might say it's hippie. I think it's just peaceful and soothing.  The truth is, I was supposed to have my bedroom redecorated. But not anymore. My dad is too lazy for that, after all.  These were approximately the colors I wanted to have. So if I can't have them on my wall, I'll have them in my garden!  Hope you like the new design. Will try to have this website evolve into something more elaborate in the near future.  At least now you can almost smell the grass, right? And I'm talking about real grass... Not that stuff you can legally buy in Amsterdam coffee shops!  Can you say Om Shanti?

      Of two jobs, which one do you pick:  1- The one that pays well, seems extremely interesting, is in a perfect location, in a team that seems to be fantastic... or 2- The one that pays very well but seems a bit less interesting?  In short, do you go for more money, or more fun?  I say more fun... if you have more fun, then you'll enjoy what you're doing, you'll become better at it and eventually, the money will come.  But not everyone seems to agree on this.  What do you think?

He keeps me awake at night, running everywhere in my ceiling.   Gives me a lot of time to think about all this stuff nobody wants to think about... especially not at 3 in the morning.

      It's cold. Very cold. See  urlLink TheLLKid's Rant World  for the weather report.  And with the cold, the ice. My office roomate had a car accident this morning... On the corner of our workplace. Hit some black ice, went across the two other lanes, and was hit on her side by another car which tried to stop, but slid too.   This afternoon, an 18-wheel truck had an accident (jack-knife) on the Mercier bridge, which had to be closed for about 3 hours and a half. When they re-opened it, they could only open one lane, and it was too late: all bridges of the island were even more jammed than usual... It took me 3 hours to get home tonight.  Trivia fact: Did you know that the Champlain bridge, in Montreal, is the second busiest bridge in North America? After the Golden Gate in San Francisco, if I'm not mistaken. Well, it took me 1 3/4 hours to cross that bridge tonight... After waiting an hour for the Mercier bridge and only moving about 500 m!  Missed yoga class. You can imagine how bummed I am. Got home at 21.25. It's now 22.40 and basically, it's time to go to bed, get up and go back to where I just came from!  Can't wait for the weekend. For several reasons. Will let you know when I can give more details.   In the meantime, missed pose of the day:      Setu Bandha Sarvangasana (Bridge pose)   P.S. Thanks for Mr. Senff for installing the new comments system on my garden/blog. Now, I'm gonna go sleep next to his  Awesome Dude . Someone's gotta keep an eye on the precious thing!

      Second to last Friday at my old job... Thank god. I still love (most of) the people there, I'll miss them a lot, but I'm definitely ready for a bigger challenge. Please no more faxes to send for people who don't know how the fax machine works and no more ink cartridges to change for people who don't know how to... and don't want to!   How amazing is that: someone (not my boss) comes to me yesterday, telling me they need my help. I ask what it's for... They tell me there's no more magenta in the color copy machine and could I please go change it? So, I tell this person that I'm gonna show them how to do it. The person says they don't want to learn, they just want me to do it. I tell them that they should learn, because they won't have me anymore to do it in a couple of days. That person tells me that they'll ask my office roomate to do it. I know my office roomate. She'd hate being asked this as much, if not more than me. So I tell this person to just come with me and I'll show them because it's so easy.  That is the same person who, a couple of months ago, came to me to tell me there was no more paper in the same machine (which is in a room away from my office because several departments use it). I tell this person that there is paper  next  to the copy machine. They tell me there isn't anymore and that they don't know where the paper is stored. So I get up, intending to show them where to find the paper. When I turn around, that person is  gone ! I bring paper to the machine, put some in it, and walk to their office and ask them  "Didn't you want me to show you where the paper was?" . You know what they said?  "Well no, I just wanted you to put some in the machine."   Why am I quitting this job? Because of small details like this.  I'm (was) an assistant. Not a slave for lazy people.   I wish we were next Friday already.   Am I glad to have found a job in my field of study, where I'm not gonna be anyone's assistant (there's a difference between being junior and being assistant/servant), in a stimulating environment? You have no idea how much. Can't wait to start.  Besides from that, bought tickets to  The Pink Floyd Experience , which I'm gonna see next Thursday. Can't wait. Should be almost as good as the real thing. Anyways, doing nothing but sitting and listening to Pink Floyd music for two hours can only make for a good time. For a number of reasons, Pink Floyd music makes me feel extremely good. It's just like one giant, fluffy, cozy and warm blanket that you want to keep wrapped around yourself forever...   Ok, so I'm delirious. But that's how Pink Floyd music makes me feel.

      ...when absolutely everything that could go wrong, does go wrong.   Must have caught this from the  urlLink Dutch arrogant bastard .   Everything went wrong this morning... And to top every little thing that went wrong, there even was a dude who reverse-drove into me with his huge pick-up truck at the Tim Horton drive-thru. Of course, the idiot didn't stop and just ran away. My car has nothing at all, but isn't it insulting that the moron wouldn't even stop to check?!  Work was pretty quiet... It's starting to hit me that I'm leaving this place; my boss is now interviewing candidates to replace me. In a week and a half, I'll have started at my new job. Time goes by very quickly. But before that, there's still a lot to do (and so little time).  Yoga last night put me in a euphoric mood. First, this pose:  Ardha Chandrasana  (Half Moon Pose)   urlLink     With my leg, I wasn't able to do that pose at all when we started learning it, about 3 months ago. Couldn't do it, on either of my legs. Well, yesterday, I did the complete full pose, standing on my left leg (with my weak leg, the right one, raised). On my right side, standing on my weak leg, I was able to raise my left leg about halfway and stay like that for a good minute. Couldn't do that for 10 seconds just a few months ago. It's amazing, the way I'm learning to work my legs (especially the weak one) and to use muscles that are atrophied because of my paralyzed ankle! There has been so much change in my body since September! And I only do yoga twice a week, for an hour and a half. It's not that much.  I was also able to do  Salamba Sarvangasana  halfway, with my legs off the wall, for about 45 seconds. Another thing I never thought I would be able to do, especially not so fast!   Salamba Sarvangasana  (Supported Shoulderstand)   urlLink     Wish I had yoga tonight, to erase everything that went wrong today.  Well, at least tomorrow is Friday. And I got an appointment with the hairdresser. That's always something to cheer a girl up.

      That's what tonight cost me.  $50 for the concert ticket.   $96 for the parking ticket.  First, the show: Arch Enemy don't make music. They make noise. Interesting phenomenon, but definitely not something I'd listen to at home. That chick just kept screaming on the top of her lungs for 45 minute. I did not understand ONE word in any of their songs. It just sounded like one big vomitting noise. Seriously. That's the noise my dad makes when he's throwing up because he has a migraine! I wish I was kidding, but I'm not...  Iron Maiden, however, I really liked. Of course it would have helped if I had known any of the songs, but now I'm definitely interesting in borrowing my boyfriend's albums... Dickinson really has an amazing voice. And his French is excellent. Two times, he entertained the crowd in French, for at least 5 minutes each time. Really, Joe Elliott is gonna have to learn more than  Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir?  if he wants to compete with Dickinson.   By the way, Montreal must definitely be a special crowd. I don't know if Dickinson was just bullshitting us when he kept saying that although they were only playing a few dates in North America, they could never skip Montreal because it's such an amazing city... But man, tonight's crowd was  LOUD .  VERY  loud.  Then, the parking story: I left my car on a street close to the Bell Centre. When I parked, I was very careful to look at all the parking signs, making sure I was allowed to park there. I even walked to the parking meter to make sure it was off business hours and that I didn't have to put money in. Everything seemed fine.  Went to the show, came out of there past 23.00... a bit stoned from all the pot that people around us were smoking, I think. Look at the spot where I left the car... no car! My friend tries to convince me that I must have left it somewhere else. No, I know I left it there! It was either stolen, or towed. Call 911, they transfer me to the police, they transfer me to the towing information center... where they don't have the information! The guy tells me to walk around, that usually they just move the car to a nearby street. So I manage to find my car. And a $96 parking ticket. $34 parking, $12 fees, $50 towing. Come on! They moved it by one block! Bunch of idiots.  So, my message to the snow removal/towing Montreal people: make sure it is  clear  that parking is forbidden! Can you believe it... they don't remove snow when we get two feet, and when we have 2 cm, they start towing people and handing tickets! I honestly believed I was in my right to park there, and that's what pisses me off. At least, I'm happy the car wasn't  stolen . But dammit, that makes for an expensive night!

      I don't know Iron Maiden. I couldn't even name one song. Sorry. I'm just not really an 80s chick. Yes, yes, I know, I love Def Leppard, but they're about the only 80s band that I like. I'm more of a 70s person.  This morning, my friend Lydie (the president's secretary at the company I work for) came to me. She heard one song by Maiden this morning and she really liked it. She suggested we go to see them at the Bell Centre tomorrow night.  Well... we will! We bought tickets, so we're going. A bit crazy, considering neither of us knows them at all, but who cares. I got a new job, I have to do silly stuff!   Mom better record 24 for me tomorrow night, cuz I'm going to rock n' roll!!!

      I think most of you guessed it, I was offered a new job. And having a new job means quitting your actual job. So I did all that today: accepted the new job, quit the old one.  Well, first of all, let me say this: I've been wanting to quit my actual job for 6 months. But my real search for a new job only started about a month and a half ago. I had three organizations calling me for interviews. Two of them asked me to take written tests (I'm in communications, so what a better way to find out if a communication specialist is good in communicating than by having them take a writing test!). The results came out pretty good. Both of them were very satisfied with my tests. One of them asked me to write an additional letter and they were very satisfied with that one too.  So, to make it short, I was offered a job last Tuesday, and was invited for a final interview with the vice-president for a second one last Friday. I refused the first job. I really wanted the second one. They offered it to me just a few hours after the final interview. I asked for the weekend to think about it.   This morning, I had a final interview at the third place. Everything went very well. I even actually enjoyed myself during this interview with the vice-president of the organization! But the other candidate seemed quite older and, of course, more experienced. But honestly, it didn't matter to me because the second job (the one that I was offered on Friday) interested me even more.   I got a phone call this afternoon, telling me that the V-P really liked me this morning, she thought I was a really good candidate, but she decided to go for the woman with more experience. Well, the choice is even easier to make then! I get to accept the one job that I wanted the most all along, and I don't even have to torture myself with thinking that I might have made a bit more money if I had picked the other (less interesting to me) one! I'm kind of relieved, I have to say.  Ok, so that's the first part of the story. The second part has to do with hanging my resignation in. A very difficult thing to do. I get along very, very well with my actual boss. We're both Julie's, so that must have to do with it! Seriously though, the first time I met this woman, I thought  I want to work with that girl . I still do. Just not for that company. So of course she was very sad. Everybody in the company was, but I think everybody also understood that I needed a bigger challenge and that I actually wanted to do what I studied for.  However, apparently, Julie's boss is putting the blame of me quitting on Julie! And that's totally unfair! It's not true... So just in case she ever reads this (which I know she won't, but I have to say it): I am not quitting my job because of my boss Julie. I really liked working with her, but I didn't see any future for me within the company and I needed something closer to my aspirations.  Julie was a little bit of a mess when she left work tonight. Can't blame her. I actually feel bad; it's because of my actions that her boss is being unfair (just once more) to her...  Alright, so I have a new job.  Communications Agent  at the  urlLink  Board of Trade of Metropolitan Montreal  . Starting on February 2nd.   Lots of things to do until then, but I'm happy with my choice...

      Ok, so I had a spine fusion 10 years ago. I mentionned that before.  So on Friday, I went to yoga to make up for Wednesday's missed class. I was in a more advanced group, but of course I know my limits, so it was no problem.  Well, I was able to do just about everything. We pretty much did backbends for the entire class.  We worked on this pose:     Urdhva Dhanurasana   Of course, I thought I wouldn't be able to do it.   There are two ways to do it when you're starting out: - By putting wood blocks against the wall and putting your hands on the blocks (that makes it easier for your wrists at first). - By having two people help you, with straps around your waist and chest. The person holding the waist strap stands on your feet to keep them on the floor and you rest your hands on the ankles of the person holding the chest strap. You push, and they lift you.  So the first option didn't work for me. I didn't even want to try it, my right leg being too weak... I was afraid I might hurt my head if I fell.   But the second option worked! I never thought that, with my fused spine, I could bend like this! Ever!  It's fantastic what yoga will make you do, even just after a short time of practice. Things that I couldn't do at all 3 months ago, I can do them now.   When they put me down after the backbend, I felt like crying. Granted, I've had a rough week, with probably 10 more hours than usual on the roads (monster traffic) and a lot of additonal stress that has been taking over me (will be able to tell more about that tomorrow)... But to the extend that I want to cry in yoga class?!   Well apparently, it's something normal. Five minutes later, the teacher said that if we had a laughter or tears crisis now or later that night, it was only normal. Opening the chest intensively like this lets the emotions that are usually locked inside get out. Most of the time, I wouldn't believe stuff like this. Guess I'd say that such beliefs  are  very hippie... But I experienced it and it's true.  Proof that yoga is therapeutic for the mind as well as for the body.

      Just added a link to  urlLink Home Star Runner  on the side bar...   I'd like to remind everyone that   I   started the whole Home Star Runner frenzy two years ago, after discovering the website in a website design class... Part of our mark for that class would go to finding and commenting crazy and cool websites. This was one of them.  Now, everybody's taking credit for it, so I thought I'd rectify things a bit. It's because of me that Home Star Runner made it into Time magazine and Entertainment Weekly a couple months back!   Ok, maybe not...

      So tonight I was dragged downtown to see  urlLink Kill Bill Volume I . Violent, but good movie. I don't know, however, if I would say it's the best movie in 10 years.  I was told by various people that it grows on you to become even better. A friend said that 3 or 4 days after seeing it, she was finding it more and more interesting. And well, of course there's  urlLink Mark  who's seen it 4 times now and is completely obsessed with it...  Ask me what I think of it again in a couple of days.

      I did it. I left my job this afternoon... For the weekend and for good.  It was such a difficult, emotional week, but today wasn't as bad as I had expected. I got used to the idea, I guess.   At around 10.20 this morning, we were all called to gather in the kitchen. Of course, I knew that meant I would have "the speech" and everything that comes with it. It was so flattering to see everyone (maybe about 50 people) gathered there to say goodbye to me, but at the same time it was so unreal. My boss, whom I was very close with, started crying and that was enough to make me cry too, although I was fine up to then. Everybody was so nice, they gave me an amazing present: a basket of products from the company, and an IKEA gift certificate (they know I need lots of stuff for my future apartment).   Really, I'm happy with the choice I made, but today it's breaking my heart to leave those people. At least, I have for consolation that I'll stay in touch with the people I was the closest to. I realize now that I made so many friends there. It's nice.  Looking forward to starting the new job, but I really need a break this weekend. Excellent thing that my boyfriend's here with me. It'll help make the transition better. And so I'm gonna go in a bubble for two days, think about nothing but enjoy the present and my boyfriend's presence...

      Yesterday, I was anxious.  Today, I am emotional.  The smallest things make me cry today. I spent most of the afternoon both eyes floating in salty water! I started crying in my boss' office just after she said something that I misinterpreted to be on a mad tone! And then after that, just about anything made me cry.  It's the stress of leaving a job that I know well and am good at (but am not satisfied with). It's the fear of starting a new job, in a company that I don't know, with people that I don't know (but am looking forward to knowing). It's having to leave people that I like behind, it's having to quit a job I'm comfortable in (but you should never get  too  comfortable, and comfortable does not mean fulfilling). It's PMSing, also.   Make no mistake. I  am  happy to be leaving the job, and I  am  looking forward to starting the new one. It's just a lot of emotions to go through. And well, this week being PMS-week, I guess the timing isn't helping.  Rough day. The end of the week will be even worse. But I'm so happy to think that, at my goodbye lunch on Thursday, people from both of the company's division are gonna be there. Considering that the divisions don't usually mix together a lot, I'm proud to say that I've been able to make good friends in both, and that I'll miss people from both. That has to be the proof of a good personality, no? To be able to get along very well with people from both divisions, when these are actually pretty independent from one another?  (Notice that I'm trying to cheer myself up a little bit here, so think carefully before you comment...)

      Yes! Yes! Yes!   urlLink  The Barbarian Invasions   did not receive one, but  two   urlLink Oscar nominations !   Totally unexpected (well, for the second one... everyone was  hoping  for a foreign language film nom'...) but so happily surprising!  Somewhat surprised to see that Nicole Kidman wasn't nominated for anything at all this year... I'm guessing Charlize Theron or Diane Keaton are gonna win Best Actress in a leading role. Hope Sean Penn gets Best Actor.  But really, if you're going to see movies in function of their Oscar nominations, do yourself a favor and go see  urlLink  The Barbarian Invasions  ... When you think that Marie-Josée Croze, actress in this movie, won Best Female Actress over Nicole Kidman in Dogville at the Cannes Festival... That has to mean something!  At least, give the  urlLink trailer  a try...

       The Barbarian Invasions  didn't win. I am truly upset.  All of you Americans out there (and Europeans too)... Try to catch that movie, in the theater or on video. It is truly a magnificent film, unfortunately very close to reality... It will remind you the value of friendship and life. Bring a lot of tissues.  If you see it in English, you'll have to deal with the subtitles, because it's a movie that was shot in French, but hey, Quebec also makes good cinema!

      It's been a while since I didn't do that one.  Just came back from yoga... I went in there with my back hurting like hell, for no apparent reason. I didn't feel like doing yoga because I was tired and my whole body was aching. But I was there to catch up the class that I missed last week because some Dutch dude was in town. It's an advanced class on top of that, and usually I do intermediate, and I didn't really feel like working hard... so basically, I didn't feel like going, but I went. Because I knew I needed it.  Well, it was an amazing class! Every single time I go to that class, I discover a new sensation, I go a step deeper into the pose. It's amazing. Maybe it has to do with the fact that the teacher explains a lot, gives a lot of details, especially about what the pose should feel like, about the sensations we should have in our body while doing it. Maybe it has to do, also, with the fact that, being a more advanced class, we do poses that I don't usually do in easier classes. That forces me to try new things and push my limits always further. Therefore, I always come out of there having discovered something new, having been able to do something I've been trying to do since the beginning, but without success.  So, I talked to the teacher, and with her approbation, I decided to switch my "all levels" class of Saturday morning to that class, on Friday nights. It's more stimulating for me. Tonight, I was able to do 3 things I've never succeeded in doing before.  Three  things in one night. That's a hell of a lot! You can't come out of there but feeling amazingly great about yourself.   Also, I decided to offer myself a treat: there is a 3-day seminar with  urlLink Hart Lazer , one of the most famous yoga teachers in Canada. Lazer has even studied with  urlLink B.K.S. Iyengar , one of the most famous and greatest modern yoga masters. This seminar is taking place at my yoga studio, at the end of May. I asked my teacher if she thought I could do it or if it would be too difficult... She said it's very demanding emotionally because we hold pauses for a very, very long time and that allows all sorts of emotions to come out, and that I should really do it because it's always good to let these emotions get out once in a while. So, May 28th, 29th and 30th, I'll be treating myself with this seminar, as a graduation present to myself (I will have finished my bachelor's degree - and my studies, after 6 years in university... at least for the moment - a week earlier).  Pose of the day:  Urdhva Mukha Svanasana (Upward-Facing Dog)    urlLink     Try it and see how amazingly well you can breathe.

      You know, when almost everything goes wrong. Or not quite wrong, but you feel that  something  isn't as it should be.  It started with me getting up 45 minutes earlier than usual to catch an earlier train to get to work early. But my mum was parked behind me and tried to drive out of the parking lot, without looking if there was any snow to plow first (we had a snowstorm overnight). She got stuck. It took 30 minutes, a neighbour and a man passing by in his car to get her out of there. Of course, I missed my train.  Work was great, although difficult. Been reading a very political memoire for about 3/4 of the day. It's very important that I understand well the project I'm working on, so it was important that I read it. It's very interesting, but it's definitely not like reading a novel and damn, my brain is fried now!  And well, I guess the stress of the new job (positive stress, but still stress) is starting to show now, so I really needed yoga tonight, but I was so tensed that it didn't go as well as usual. We did some positions that were very frustrating for me (because of my leg problem, I couldn't do it right) and at some point I really felt like crying. Stress showing up.  But then again, it's so therapeutical that now, I'm home, feeling great. I'm tired, I'll go to bed soon, I had a tough day but I'm looking forward to going to work tomorrow because I'm loving it and for now, I'm gonna go and snuggle with my Snorlax.

Partly because I have a confidentiality agreement and I would think that talking about it on a website would violate it.   So, I guess my latest posts have been a bit controversial. Not this one.   I don't know what I'm gonna talk about, actually. It's been an amazing second day at work, I am totally thrilled with the way it's going.  Besides from that, nothing, really.   Uh oh... no controversy = boredom? Is that why we  create  controversy, most of the time?  I don't know... I just think it's nice to have a quiet day from time to time.  Oh, yoga tomorrow! It's been a week (since I didn't go to my class this weekend)... Looking forward to that!

      Some people apparently did not appreciate my opinion on the war.  I'll just add this to the subject:  I, too, am more than happy that Irak was freed from Saddam Hussein. I, too, think that Saddam Hussein is a horrible, horrible monster, and I wish he hadn't been in control of this country for so long, hurting his own people so much.  However, I do not agree with the techniques that were used to defeat him. Also, let's not forget that the war wasn't launched for the crimes Hussein committed against his own people. That is  not  the reason why Bush and Blair wanted to defeat him.  That is  not  the reason behind this war. It never was. The "official" reason were weapons of mass destruction. However, it was never proved that Irak had any. And it is doubted they ever had any, now more than ever.  The truth is, Bush and Blair needed a reason to attack Irak. They fabricated one. Just like stories were fabricated to justify the first war against Irak. Just like stories were fabricated to glorify American troops (Jessica Lynch, anyone?). That's misinformation. That's propaganda. It's fake.  If the American and British governments wanted to do something good for Irak and free Irak people from Hussein, they could have used peaceful ways. They could have used ways that would have saved thousands of lives: Americans, Iraquis, British, etc. But they wanted to  take control , not  free ...  Sorry, but I will never agree with such violence... Especially not when it's people like Bush and Blair, sending people they've never met and never thanked, to their death. Especially not when it's people like them who are never at risk personally in these wars. Easy to send people to their deaths when you're sitting behind a desk all day, busy being the most powerful man on earth.   Anybody can tell me, exactly, how come it is that even the most powerful man on earth can't  (or doesn't want to?)  capture one man without sending civilians and military men to their death?

      So I lived through it. The first day at the new job. Always the tough part. So much information to absorb all at once. You also have to adapt to your new situation, your new collegues, your new work space, etc.   Well, what can I say? It's been only one day, but I'm absolutely thrilled with the new job, the new place, the new people... The challenge is huge, and I'm loving it. I've never felt so trusted in my job before. Okay, maybe I have, but only after several years working there. I never started a new job feeling so trusted and, therefore, feeling so confident. One goes with the other. It's amazing to know that people are trusting you and will let you do what you were hired for (instead of checking on you all the time, therefore making you doubt of your abilities).  I'm loving it...

      George W. Bush and Tony Blair were nominated as potential winners of the  urlLink Peace Nobel Prize  today.  Well, I would like to award the politician who suggested these men the  Stupidity Nobel Prize . That title, which I just made up, should go to the stupidest stupid politician on the planet. Even stupider than the first two ones mentionned in this blog... and that says a lot!  How anybody would think that Bush and Blair were doing something for peace by launching this war is beyond me. They didn't do it to free the people of Irak from the dictator that was Saddam Hussein.   Petrol   They did not do it because they thought Irak had weapons of massive destruction.   Petrol   They did it because of the  PETROL .   PETROL    Now, the Bush government is getting in hot water because people are starting to doubt the information they had before launching the war. Maybe they knew Irak didn't possess weapons of massive destruction.   Big news     And we should   award   him and his little British friend now?!  Seriously, this world has gone mad.

        urlLink Is yoga a religion?    Yoga is not a religion. It is a philosophy that began in India an estimated 5,000 years ago. The father of classical ashtanga yoga (the eight-limbed path, not to be confused with Sri K. Pattabhi Jois' Ashtanga yoga) is said to be Patanjali, who wrote the Yoga Sutra. These scriptures provide a framework for spiritual growth and mastery over the physical and mental body. Yoga sometimes interweaves other philosophies such as Hinduism or Buddhism, but it is not necessary to study those paths in order to practice or study yoga.   It is also not necessary to surrender your own religious beliefs to practice yoga.    Yes, yoga is about finding our inner peace and learning compassion. But unfortunately, I don't have the time to practice yoga 5 hours a day. I can only do 3 hours a week. And I practice yoga and like the philosophy; I did not sign up to become a Buddhist monk.  Yes, I'm sad that my dog is old and will be dying soon. But that doesn't mean that it's bothering me so much that I'm doing and saying stupid stuff and sounding all disturbed, as some people seem to be thinking.  I am living in a modern world, with modern problems. I care about knowing and understanding the world I live in, therefore I educate myself and form my own opinions about it, and I care enough to defend them.   I don't think that you can live life by being neutral and having no opinion, playing it safe all the time. Yes, I'm passionate. Yes, I can make mistakes sometimes or be a bit harsh. But at least I'm putting myself out there and initiating the discussion. You can't like everybody and agree with everybody all the time.  That's not human.   So nobody come and talk down on me, like I'm just some poor kid who's so affected by the loss of her dog she's also losing her mind.  This is my blog, my place to vent, and I use it to state my opinions and beliefs. Don't like it? Don't come here. At least, I make this about me; I'm not hiding behind a blog that is merely reporting what is happening on other blogs.  I don't need someone talking to me like they're my mother; I already have a mother. I don't need someone to talk to me like they think they have the answer to everything. I  am  at peace because I chose to live like I live and to care enough to go after the things I want.   I'm not PMS. I'm just sick of people hiding behind all-made answers, being too afraid to put themselves and their heart out there.

      Ok, so according to most Americans and Canadians, I (and a lot of other French  and  English Canadians) am wrong to have been offended by the comments that were made against my culture this week.  According to some Americans quoted in articles,  We had it coming for years  and  it's about time we pay for the problems we created in Canada by trying to defend our language . Also, apparently  it was the truth and that's why we can't take it . So if that's the truth, I'm dumb and obnoxious, I can't speak the language of North America, and you can smell my crotch at a 10-meter distance. Aren't you just dying to meet me now?  Okay, so we're dumb and we have no right to want to protect the language we've been speaking since this country was founded in Quebec City 400 years ago. If that is so, I won't mention it again... as long as I don't ever hear an American complain about the raise of Spanish speakers in the USA (believe it or not, I've had discussions with Americans who felt threatened because too much people speak Spanish in Connecticut, Florida or California!). Also, I won't mention it again, as long I don't hear another English Canadian say that Canada and America are very different. Because guess what? That difference stands on the biculturalism of our country. That difference stands on the fact that two cultures can supposedly coexist in one united country.   Seems like I will still be able to talk about it for long, long time, eh?  Try being a minority of 7 million French people in a continent of 350+ million English people. Try making those people understand that you're no worse than they are and that you just want to be allowed to live according to your own culture, instead of being assimilated by the American culture that seems to want to take over the entire planet. Or at least live in French in the middle of that unavoidable culture. We want to avoid being assimilated like the Cajuns in Louisiana, where the very last generation of French speaking people is dying down there. Is that so bad?  Guess what? I have been a federalist all my life. I never understood why Quebec people wanted to become a separate country. I never felt threatened, because  I  am open to all the cultures that surround me and I consider that I blend very well in them. But when I see an idiot puppet, paid by my government to make my country laugh, come in the streets of the oldest modern city of this continent and insult an old man who can't understand and therefore can't defend himself, I stop laughing, and I stop thinking that other cultures are also open to us.   Now, I'm starting to believe that maybe we should separate from the rest of this country. And then, Canada will loose its uniqueness, and it will just become another state of the United-States of America. Two other states actually. Because without Quebec, Canada will be the stupidest-looking country on the world map: Pacific ocean, big red chunk, big blue chunk, big red chunk, Atlantic ocean. Or maybe then there can be Canada, Quebec, and Newfoundland? Cuz I'm pretty sure that they're getting tired of being  the  other  scapegoat of Canada.   I guess it's a situation that is more difficult to understand than I ever imagined. Because I thought any Montrealer would be sensitive to this problematic. I thought any Montrealer would understand the uniqueness of our culture and the importance of preserving it,  even if they only speak one of the two languages . I thought that any Montrealer would understand that to preserve this, we have to start by changing the rest of the world's opinion of us, making them see that we're not there just to cause trouble. To do that, we don't need to pay foreigners to come and shit on us. There are already people within this very country who can do that anyways.  Maybe I will vote yes at the next referendum, for a change. Maybe next time that I go to a restaurant in Montreal where I am served in English, I will pretend that I don't understand and insist on speaking French. Because hey, it's in my right, in this province, to be served in the language of my choice between French and English. I used to just go along with any language someone would address themselves to me in. You start speaking English? Alright, we'll speak English. You switch to French? French is fine too, let's speak French. I don't mind, I'm comfortable in both. But hey, if it's gonna be like that, I'm just gonna be an ass too and will piss people off. Because what's the point of being nice and getting along with everybody, if you're considered to be the black sheep anyways?   Vive le Québec libre!

       urlLink Politicians in Ottawa expressed their anger at Conan's comments today.  The country gives money to him and his crew, and he comes and insults us. His comments were called  racist  at the House of Commons today. I'm glad. He deserved it.   Quote from the article:  However, businessman Peter Soumalias, who helped bring the New York-based show to Toronto, says some politicians may not understand comedy but the people of Quebec do. "Quebec is home to the Just For Laughs festival; they understand comedy," he said.   I agree to disagree.  Any  humour is not always funny. To be funny, it has to be witty and intelligent. Otherwise, it's just plain stupid and offensive. My taxes paid for this idiot to come here and insult my culture. Is that why I have hundreds of dollars taken from my paycheck every week?! I'm requesting a refund.  Guess where Conan was today, in all the controversy? Hiding. Wuss.  ---  As you can see, I'm a very emotional person.   But I went to yoga tonight, to calm all these emotions (although I'm back home and still whining about the whole thing... guess it didn't work this time, eh?!). We started working on a pose so weird that I can't find a picture for it. (I guess it would help if I knew its name, but oh well...). Basically, you squat, put your hands on the ground behind your heels (with the thumb and the index on both sides of the heel), slowly bring your feet close to each other then cross your ankles, bring your elbows under your knees and start lifting your feet from the floor. First try, I couldn't even squat properly. Second try, I was able to lift my feet a little little bit. Pretty cool to think that I was almost able to do it so fast... I'm loving how yoga is making me do all these weird things I never thought I would!

      I'm sorry.  I like Americans. I really do. I have a lot of American friends.  And I used to like Conan. I thought he was witty and funny.  urlLink Until he came to our country and pooped all over French Canadians .  It's like visiting friends in their beautiful house, and pooping all over their bedroom:  you don't do that !  If you're American and consider yourself to be one of the luckiest people in the world because you are, think again. French Canadians are. Do you know why? Because we are not just bicultural. We are tricultural, even more. Being French Canadians, we can (if we decide to open our minds to it) benefit from the best of not one, not two, not even three, but four or even more cultures! Being French Canadian, I get the best of 4+ worlds: French Canadian, English Canadian, American, French (from France) and even more. Any of you can say that, in their record collection, they have albums from French Canadian, English Canadian, American and French artists  and that they understand everything that is being said in those songs ? I can. Anyone has ever read books by French Canadian, English Canadian, American and French authors in their original language? I have. Anyone can say that they feel at home in Quebec, Canada, the USA and France? I can.  Whenever you think about saying  You're in North America -- learn the language  or something to that effect, think about this: up until not so long ago,  urlLink most of the American territory belonged to France . Chances are that people used to speak French where you live. Or Spanish. But because the English were (and still are) louder with their guns, the French in North America died everywhere, except here. Nobody come and tell me to learn the language of North America. First of all, because I already know it. But also because, historically, the language of North America was just about  anything but English . And to something like  You're in North America -- learn the language , I would reply  You're living on a planet called Earth -- learn that Americans don't rule  everything    The Celine Dion issue, now. You may like her, you may not like her. That's your choice. I used to hate her. Now, I love her. For the least, you can't not admire a woman like her, who's spent her whole life building her career. Who comes from a little French Canadian town and is now the most famous singer on the planet. You can't admire the fact that she went from singing really badly to having this absolutely amazing voice (because she does... like what she sings or not, you can't deny that). The woman worked extremely hard, sacrificed a lot of things to live her dream, and she did it  using only her voice, not her body .  There are many more points that I would like to discuss, but time is lacking this morning. Damn, I'm pissed off. I consider myself to have a very good sense of humour, but really, I don't find this funny. It is extremely weak to go to  Toronto  and dump on  Quebec  like that. I'll just comfort myself by thinking the only reason they did this is because they're jealous. They can't understand what Celine Dion says, and we do. That must be it.  But dammit, I wish some Americans would learn that they're not alone on this planet.  And I'll never watch Conan again.

Quitting my old job and accepting this one was the best decision that I could make; I'm so glad I decided to take the risk. I've never felt so competent and trusted, and as a result, I  am  competent and self-confident. Love this feeling.  But in general, today is not a good day.

      Anybody ever had to put their dog (or cat, for that matter) to sleep?  My dog, a 11-year old chocolate lab, is getting old and tired. Like a lot of labs, he's had trouble with his hips for years now and now he's having a lot of trouble walking. He falls a lot and has problems climbing and going down stairs.   But he's still the excited puppie he always was, so happy to see us when we get home, running to the door to greet us, wiggling his tail when we enter a room... He's just as silly as he ever was. He just doesn't seem to realize that he's not as much in shape as he used to.  Now, my parents and my sister are bugging me almost daily, telling me it's time to put him to sleep. I know they're right. But I just can't agree to it. He's my puppie, my baby, and I can't decide of the moment of his death. I can't imagine knowing that he has 5, then 4, then 3, 2, 1 and 0 days left. I can't imagine him leaving the house with my dad and my sister (no matter when it is, I know that I can't go, it'll be way too difficult), all happy thinking he's going for a ride, not knowing he's just going to his death. I just can't do it. It's too horrible.  Some people will say he's just a dog. But he's not. He's been my best friend for 11 years. He's been the one thing that I know I can hug every day. The one thing who's always there to play with me when I'm happy, or to just climb on my lap and put his huge head on my stomach when I'm sad, as if to say  I'm here and I love you . When my parents, or my sister can be a pain in the ass, when my boyfriend is away in Europe, he's the one being who's always there to cheer me up and bring me a bit of warmth. Maybe it's crazy to be so attached to a dog, but I will feel so lonely when he's gone.   I know that I  should , but I just can't do it. I would feel like I'm betraying him. As long as he still comes to the door to greet me, as long as he still wiggles his tail when he sees me, as long as he still climbs on my lap every night to cuddle a bit, I won't think that he's ready to die and won't be able to do it.   Anybody ever gone through something like this? How can you decide of the death of something that's been such a big part of your life?

      Well, I took a 5-day break from the Internet. It was much needed after everything that's been going on last week.   I need to learn not to care about other people's opinions so much.   The vice-president of our organization forced an afternoon off on us yesterday... Going from a company where we were forced to do 30 minutes overtime every day to an organization where they think that, generally, people are working too much and that when people work too much, they become inefficient; therefore wanting those people to have a life so that they can keep enjoying and being good at their job... that's quite a change, but of course I'm loving it!   Companies will  have to  realize that people's careers is not what matters the most anymore and people are looking for a boss that will understand that they also have a life and that they actually work to have a life, not live to work.   Well I'm glad I found a place like that. It only makes you enjoy your work more anyways. So companies that understand that are very bright. By letting their employees have a life, they're actually making them even more committed to their job! Funny, eh?!  But now it's the weekend, so I shouldn't really think about work.   Just bought tickets to see Aerosmith in April (I already know what Mr. Dutchboy will think about that) and watched two movies today:  In The Cut  with Meg Ryan, and  Runaway Jury  with John Cusack.  In The Cut  was weird, very slow paced, extremely explicit, yet I had to watch until the end.  Runaway Jury  was your typical John Grisham movie. You either love it or hate it, depending on the issue that's at stake. In this case, it's gun control... I'm totally against guns, so I loved it.  (Please do not start a pro/anti gun discussion in the comments, I do NOT want to get into that; I'm just saying where I stand.)  People who love controversy will just find it annoying because it solves a complicated issue in two hours.   Anyways, that was good for entertainment, but I keep forgetting that I'm taking my last class and that I should actually work on it. Could this be over already?

      That's the feeling I've been having since last night.  Cooper is gone. He fell asleep forever about 25 hours ago.   I wasn't there. Everyone was (my dad, my mom and my sister), but I wasn't. I'm way too sensitive and being there would have been unbearable, and I also had to go to the airport to pick up a certain Dutchboy. So we sat there, at the bar, drinking to Cooper's memory, until I got a call from my family telling me it was all over...  Then I came home, and that's when it really hit me. I'll never seen him again.  Ever.  The house is so empty without him. It feels like there's something wrong with every little thing I do. Starting with opening the front door. Nobody there to greet me with a happy wiggling tail anymore. Nobody sits next to me, drooling, every time I'm eating something. There's nobody who runs to me to say good morning when I get up either. Nobody to wait by the door of the bathroom when I take a shower. Nobody to peek in my bedroom when my door is not well closed. Nobody climbing on my lap at least once every night to get his ears scratched until he grunts with satisfaction.  Only now do I realize that he was  literally always  there for me. He was the only one who was  always  happy to see me. Dogs are more pure than any human being will ever be. They really give  unconditional love .  The feeling of emptiness is almost unbearable. And I can't help but think about that moment, yesterday morning, when I was on the floor, crying. My mom came to hug me, and Cooper came to us, putting his big wet nose between the two of us, as if to comfort us. Every time I think about it, I get this cramp in my stomach...  My parents said he was very calm last night. Usually, the minute he gets to the vet's office, he starts shaking like a leaf. Last night, he just sat there, watching people, turning his head in that cutest way dogs do when they observe something. He wasn't shaking at all. He was just fine. I've been telling him all week that he would be so much better, that he'd be able to run again and that he wouldn't hurt anymore. I guess that, in some way, he knew...  Dutchboy says I'm such a drama queen. I guess I am. But it's just because I'm passionate and emotional about everything. Maybe too much, I don't know. But I've always been passionate and emotional about Cooper, and I will always be...   Cooper, t'es l'amour de ma vie...

Because I want my puppie to be in a happy place. But since they announced me on Saturday that they had made the appointment, I've been living in a blackhole and, spending even more time than usual with my dog, got more and more convinced that it was too soon.   He still has a quality of life. Yeah, he's having arthritis, and cataracts, and is becoming more incontinent. But we can make his life easier by making him avoid the stairs, turning a light on at night, and putting him outside more often. He still greets us at the door every night when we come home from work. He still spends all dinners sitting next to us, begging for food from our plates. He still comes to cuddle with me in front of the TV for a few minutes, every night, before asking me for a cookie.   The day that he's not happy to see us anymore, the day that he's not interested by the food from our plate anymore, the day he doesn't even want a cookie anymore... That day, I'll know it's his way of telling us he's ready. But not sooner.   If my dad hadn't expressed doubts, I would have gone through with it. But if  he  isn't even sure that it's the good thing to do anymore, then it really isn't. Not yet.  We're keeping Cooper with us a little longer. I'll do everything to make his life easy and happy. I'll spoil him like he's never been spoiled before. Because he's the only being who's always been there for me, who's always understood me; being happy when I was happy, comforting me when I was sad, coming to me for protection when my dad or my sister were mad... giving me his unconditional love and support.  I won't abandon him and give him up while he still wants to live. But I know that I can't keep him with me forever. It's just a matter of time. But I'll really cherish all the time we have... getting ready to let him go when he tells me he is.  This is a bittersweet day, but you have to grab happiness while it's passing by...

      Thursday, February 26th.  That's the day when my 11-year old chocolate labrador retriever, Cooper, will be put to sleep.  I know it has to be done and I know he'll be in a much better place, but it's totally breaking my heart.   I'm not in a very chatty mood right now. I just wish I didn't feel so small, powerless and sad...

      Okay, so today I found out about the residential project of my dreams.  I've always dreamed of living in a loft built downtown, in an old factory.  Why? Because old factories are charming, with their old architecture, original wood beams and big wide windows. They have an antique look that warms everything up, unlike the new, modern constructions that we often see, à la American Psycho. I like antique, I like wood, I like stone... I don't like white walls, slick black furniture and stainless steel everywhere.   So yeah, I always dreamed of having enough money to afford one of those places.  And today, I found out about the perfect residential project that would offer all I've been dreaming of, at an almost affordable price!  The project is called  urlLink Lowney .  Lowney is a project targeting 25-35 year old people, buying a residence for the first time. That would be me. It's located downtown, at a 5-minute walk from where I work. And wait, there's even better! Those lofts are being built in the old Lowney chocolate factory... a beautiful building from the beginning of the last century. It's in a neighbourhood that's under development, it'll be amazing in a couple of years. The place is rather cheap for what it offers... hell, it's  very  cheap for such a nice place in downtown Montreal! And well, if Dutchboy and I were living together already, we  could  afford it.   I can't afford it alone, however. The project is due for delivery in the summer 2005... I don't think we're gonna make that. But dammit, for the first time in my life, I'm seriously thinking that I'd like to buy a place, and I'd like it to be there. Take a look.   The project      The old chocolate factory      The neighbourhood     Man, I want to live there. It's nice, but not too nice that we really can't afford it. It'd be perfect. A nice, little, cozy nest downtown Montreal... Hell, I could almost even sell my car! We wouldn't need a car. We'd be close to everything. I'd need to walk about 10 minutes to get to work. And I mean, it's downtown. It'd probably be close to wherever Dutchboy will find a job too.   It's a building I've known and loved for years... I used to park next to it when I worked at the Bank of Montreal, a couple of years ago. I would walk by it every day, looking at that old, empty building, thinking it was such a magnificent place and how sad it was that nothing was being done with it. It's right in front of a police station. I would think it's a very safe area...  Damn, it's perfect. Have I said it already?  I'm probably dreaming for nothing. Like I said, I can't afford it on my own and Dutchboy and I won't probably get settled on time for delivery in the summer of 2005. But there are gonna be 3 more phases to the project, in nearby buildings. The last phase should be delivered in 2007. Who knows???  I'll definitely be going to the sales office this week... just for fun, and for dreaming material...

      A strictly mathematical viewpoint.  From a strictly mathematical viewpoint it goes like this: What Makes 100%? What does it mean to give MORE than 100%? Ever wonder about those people who say they are giving more than 100%? We have all been to those meetings where someone wants you to give over 100%. How about achieving 103%? What makes up 100% in life? Well, here's a little mathematical formula that might help you answer these questions:   If: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z  is represented as:   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26.   Then: H-A-R-D-W-O-R-K is  8+1+18+4+23+15+18+11 = 98%   and K-N-O-W-L-E-D-G-E is  11+14+15+23+12+5+4+7+5 = 96%    But,  A-T-T-I-T-U-D-E is  1+20+20+9+20+21+4+5 = 100%  And,   B-U-L-L-S-H-I-T is  2+21+12+12+19+8+9+20 = 103%   AND, look how far ass-kissing will take you.  A-S-S-K-I-S-S-I-N-G is  1+19+19+11+9+19+19+9+14+7 = 118%   So, one can then conclude with mathematical certainty that while Hard work and Knowledge will get you close, and Attitude will get you there, Bullshit and Ass-kissing will put you over the top.

      Or more like accepting it.  I still miss him and sometimes look for him, forgetting he's gone. But now I feel better about it and I'm happy he isn't suffering anymore.  So, Oscar night yesterday.  The Lord of the  bo Rings  won everything, making it a very boring evening. It was depressing to see that  urlLink Dutchboy  was right about everything, except  Best Actor . And damn were we happy that he was wrong about that won and that Sean Penn won. He's absolutely an amazing actor and he totally deserved it.  One other thing made me happy and, you guess it, it's Denys Arcand winning for Best Foreign Language Movie with  The Barbarian Invasions . Maybe it is true that no one cares but Canadians... or even Quebeckers. But this movie  is  a masterpiece and deserved the Oscar. Funny fact:  The Barbarian Invasions  is the first Canadian movie deserving the Best Foreign Language Movie in the Academy Awards' history. It is the third Canadian movie being nominated in this category. All three movies nominated were by Denys Arcand. Found that out while writing a  urlLink press release  today, the  urlLink Board of Trade of Metropolitan Montreal  being an organization working towards making Montreal one of the capitals of the world and supporting the success of Quebec's culture outside of the province/country.   Speaking of work, I'm starting my 5th week now and I'm still totally loving it. The Board of Trade's objectives are so interesting, challenging and stimulating, the team is absolutely amazing, the philosophy is very modern. It really is an organization where I could work for a long, long time. And I hope I will.  Dutchboy just went home. If it wasn't for that and for me missing Cooper, I'd say everything's perfect. But it can't be  all  perfect, right?

      Okay, I'll admit it. I have a problem. I'm way addicted to  Friends . Definitely been watching it too much lately. Damn DVD boxsets.  I'm getting a haircut on Thursday night. Because it's been 3 months since the last time and well, I'm just due. So the question is... do I keep my actual haircut, which more or less looks like Jennifer Aniston's actual look (although less wavy and more straight  or  curly, depending on whether I use the flat iron or volumizing mousse), or do I go for something a bit shorter, like she had a year or two ago? Why her? Just because her hair's always looked great and I'm thinking about going shorter. Just not  too  short, and she's the best example of how short I'd like it to be.  What do  you  prefer?   Long hair      Short hair

      Went to see   urlLink The Australian Pink Floyd   at the Bell Centre last night.  The show was absolutely amazing... Although I do not think that the visual dimension adds much to Pink Floyd's music - I really do think the best way to listen to Pink Floyd is lying on your bed, doing absolutely nothing but listening to the music -, I thought the show was awesome and I really, really enjoyed it. The beauty of Pink Floyd, too, is that you really don't need the music to be played by the actual Pink Floyd musicians to totally enjoy it. I mean, any good musician will do, because the star of Pink Floyd isn't the musicians, it's the music itself.  Well anyways, the crowd went absolutely mad at the Bell Centre last night. Once more. Def Leppard keeps saying that the best crowd in the world is Montreal's. Question is, do most artists/bands think so too? Well, a lot of them do... And once again, last night, the members of the Aussie Floyd said that they didn't think they  ever  had a better crowd before.  Always great to hear something like that (the best crowd comment  and , of course, the Pink Floyd music)...

      So today was a pretty regular day... Besides the whole  "being jealous of my boyfriend because he's spending the night at Sav's"  thing.  Whereas my boyfriend complains about having to ride the train to get to Sheffield, I can't help but envy him a bit because well, he's being invited by Joe and Sav, what the hell he is complaining about?  Well I guess it's normal stuff for him. It  is  still pretty exciting for me, though. Dutchboy and I have been together for many years and a half now and really, I have been around the guys of DL more often  before  we were together than since! I mean, I'm not even  sure  that he's telling the truth when he says that he's going to visit them... I've never been with him so, for all I know, he could be going to the beach with half a dozen of his groupies!...  I went for a beer (or well, a Perrier in my case) with a couple of collegues in a bar downstairs the building where we work tonight... I left my boots and my jacket up in my office, so at around 18.55, I left the bar and went up to get my stuff. Put my boots on, my jacket, go to the bathroom because the Perrier was manifesting itself, call for the elevator... It doesn't work. It's stucked on the 6th floor. I can't make it move, I can just make it open the doors to get off it. I'm all alone, I want to go home... The elevator is obviously broken or something. So I take the emergency stairway. I get to the floor level... door locked! I go back upstairs... door locked! I go to the street level (lower than the floor level); it's an emergency door. If I open it, the fire alarm will go off and the whole building will be evacuated!  What do I do?! I call 411 to try to get a phone number to reach the security people from the building. Stupid operator can't find a phone number! Last option: call the police. They tell me they'll send someone. But of course, I'm not priority. I could be stuck there for hours. So I stand by the door, watching through the little window, in case someone passes by (of course, that door is in the back, where no one ever walks by)... After about 20 minutes, a security guy walks by... I bang on the door, he sees me,  rolls his eyes big time , come to the door, screams that I'm not allowed to take the stairs, call his collegue on his walkie-talkie, tells him that some chick has locked herself in the staircase (that's me!)and that he'll call him back with her name soon.   Then , the stupid dude opens the door, with that look on his face that tells me he's thinking I'm really, really stupid.  You're not supposed to take the stairs! . Oh. Thanks for telling me. That's very useful now that I've  already locked myself in , right?! He tells me that the elevators stop working at 19.00, that after that time you actually have to use your security pass against some sort of magic eye to make it work.   Why is it that I am feeling extremely stupid for something that isn't my fault? I mean, they could post a schedule of the operating hours of the elevator on the main floor, and indications near that magic eye for people who are looking to make the elevator work or something, right? Otherwise, I can't just  guess . So please don't treat me like I'm just some kind of idiot girl. I can't just read it in the sky, somebody has to mention it!  So yeah. Hate that security dude for making me feel so stupid after having had to worry about being locked there all night for 30 minutes. Hate him for making me cry for something that wasn't my fault. I was just trying to get home!  No but  how much  do you think I wish I was in Sheffield too?

      Okay, so you know I'm not likely to brag about my boyfriend's connection with Def Leppard.  But today, I have to make an exception. Because I'm damn jealous.  Mister Dutch Arrogant Bastard Senff just called me from Manchester, England... He's getting on a train to Sheffield and will spend the night at Rick Savage's place, with Mr. Savage himself, and Joe Elliott.  How jealous are we all?!  No but  seriously !

      Went to my friend's mom's service last night.  It was  so  sad.  She was 50 years old... Way too young to die of anything.  When I got up this morning, the first thing I did was tell my mother that I love her. It made her cry! I guess I don't tell her enough.  If you want to do something good today, tell your mom you love her... She deserves to hear it.

      The mother of one of my friends died Friday night. I just learned about it. So sad. Cancer, about 52 years old. Way too young to die. I mean, how would I deal with having to lose one of my parents so young? Don't think I could handle it.  She'd been sick for a while. I saw him about two months ago and he was expecting her to pass away within the next week. She lived 7 more weeks. But what quality of life did she have during that time? Not much, I'm sure.  Anyways, it's sad. This guy's girlfriend, also one of my friends, went through the exact same thing with her dad when the two of them started being together, about 6 years ago. So unfair that two people so young should have to go through this twice within such a short amount of time.  Although I've sort of lost touch with them during the past years, they called me to let me know and I'll be there tomorrow. It's not because life happens and keeps you away from some of the people you care the most about that you can't be there for them when they really need you. Right now is such a moment. All my thoughts are with them...

      Well, this was a crazy day.  This weekend, something came up in the medias related to the (political) project I'm responsible for at work. Since politics are too controversial, I'm not gonna say what it is. It's municipal anyways, so no one would care. So we got tons of requests for interviews todays, and lots of people phoning in for information. I had to forward a request for interview from national television to the person responsible for media relations, and another request from one of the main papers in the city...  I'm a young professional, just starting out with my career, so although I am in communications and I know I will have to deal with tons of journalists through my career, I'm still very impressed, for the moment, whenever I get such a request and whenever I have the smallest thing to do with an article printed in a newspaper or something being said on TV. It's just so gratifying to see the results of what we've been working on and studying for all our life, you know?  So tomorrow morning, there will be an article about the organization I'm representing in one big newspaper in town. And tomorrow night, there will also be something on national television. So please allow me to be excited about that, because I can then see the fruits of my labour.  After work, I went shopping at IKEA. When I left my old job, I was given a $100 gift certificate at IKEA as a goodbye gift. So tonight, I went to spend it... Bought a big, fluffy, duck down quilt for my bed, two nice, big, comfy pillows... and a cheap lamp for my desk at work since I keep asking for a light and never get it.   So for one of the very rare times, I'm very looking forward to going to bed... But first, I got some studying to do: I have my mid-term exam to do this weekend, so I need to prepare for it. Last mid-term exam of my life! Or well, of my bachelor's degree. Can't promise I'll never go back to school after that, cuz that might be a promise I won't be able to keep!   And before I go to sleep, I'll do some anti-stress yoga. Because I deserve some deep relaxation... Everyone should offer themselves a little bit of time for that. Particularly good for people prone to anxiety attacks (such as myself)...  Oh, and tonight, I drove by the  urlLink Lowney . The building is still almost totally empty, they're just starting out on the project. I'll go to the sales office on Thursday. Damn, I want to live there!

      Tonight I was having a discussion with my mom, about my cancer...  The thing is, I'm going to see an homeopath on Saturday, for some physical problems, as well as anxiety troubles. I'm always been prone to anxiety attacks (seems after reading some of your blogs, I'm not the only one either!). And well, I'm sick of being so anxious all the time, I've decided it was time to do something. So I'll start with homeopathy; something natural...  On the phone today, my homeopath was asking me some questions about cancer. If I had chemio or radiotherapy, why it took 3 months between the moment I was diagnosed and the moment I had surgery. She was also asking me if my mom had to go through intense emotions while she was pregnant with me, etc.  Turns out that the one intense emotion she went through while she was pregnant was this: my parents had a couple of friends who had a 3-year old daughter, named Julie. She died from cancer, while my mom was pregnant with me. My parents thought she was so cute and so courageous, they decided to name me after her. Little did they know, I was gonna develop that same cancer 4 months later!  I had always known about that story... but the last time I heard it was such a long time ago, I wasn't even sure anymore if I made it up or if it was real. Turns out it is real! Crazy, eh?!  But I forgot my train of thought. Why is my mom my new hero?  Because of all the rest! Turns out that it took 3 months before I had my surgery because most people involved in my file were against the idea of operating. They thought I was too screwed up already, that I had no chance and that they should just try chemio and radio, see if that worked. Otherwise, they would just let me go.  Well they did that for 6 weeks. Without telling my parents once that they thought I had no chance of surviving: they found out 3 years later what the doctors really thought back then. Radio and chemio didn't work. One day, my mom got mad. I was terribly sick, so she took me, put me in the doctor's arms and said  "Do something. I don't know what, but you  have  to do  something ."  Two days later, they were operating.  After my surgery, they told my parents that  if  I would survive, I would never walk. Nine months later, I started walking. Today, some people never notice I'm wearing a leg brace.  When telling me this story, my mom made me cry. Not because it's  my  story. I don't remember any of it. Not consciously, at least. Some of it probably still is in my memory, somewhere. But I don't remember remembering it. So I cried, but only because it's such a sad story and my parents were so strong. The doctors wanted to let me die because they thought I didn't have a chance, but my parents said  "No way, you HAVE to do something" . I can't image going through something like this, ever. My mom said that honestly, you don't have time to stop and cry. You just do what you gotta do, because you have no choice. But while she was telling me that, her eyes were filled with water.  I've always admired my mom. She has been through a LOT, without ever complaining, and always trying to make everyone happy. The woman would have all the reasons in the world to be bitter today. But she's not. And well, I still live with her. But we're two adults now (for a total of 5 adults in the house right now), and so we don't always agree and I wish I didn't have to live with her on a daily basis. So yeah, she gets on my nerves sometimes. But tonight I realized just how much she has always been committed to making our lives easier, and making them happy. Or, in my case, just making my life  happen .   Tonight, I thanked her for doing all this for me, and hugged her. She is so amazing. And I've decided I can't live my life being anxious all the time. That's not what she fought so hard, without hesitating, for. I owe it to her to learn to completely enjoy my life and not be afraid. And that's what I'm gonna do.  One more thing: if one of your children ever gets sick, do whatever you have to do to save them. Don't listen to a doctor who'll tell you that there isn't anything to do. The truth is  they don't know . Miracles  do  happen. You have to at least  try .

      I miss Cooper like crazy.   Can't get used to the emptiness. Whatever I do when I'm at home, there's always  something  missing. That something is my little Coop.  Yesterday, I was looking out the window, in the backyard, and saw this bone Cooper lost in the snow about two weeks and a half ago. That was one of the bones we gave him on his last weekend, to spoil him even more. Seeing it felt like someone punching me in the stomach. I really miss my puppie baby...  Wish I could get a new one right away. No, he wouldn't replace Cooper, because no dog ever will, but he would be just as sweet as Cooper and I know I would love him just as much. But I can't. Probably won't have one before a couple of years.  But come on, who isn't dying to have one of those cuties?

      Remember  urlLink Samantha Fox ?     She used to sing that  Touch Me  song, for which my mom thanked heaven that I did not understand English when I was singing it all the time in 1988... Poor mom, I  did  understand the lyrics! I just didn't think they were  bad !  Well anyways, she's back. I know she's never really been away (Dutchboy saw her at some festival about a year and a half ago), but tonight she was on a Quebec TV show seen by more than 2 million people (huge ratings for a 7 million province):  urlLink Star Académie .  Star Académie is a Quebec version of Idol, sorta. The kids live together in a house for 9 weeks, get tons of singing/acting/dancing etc. lessons, there's a 30 minutes show on TV every night from Monday to Thursday, and a 1 1/2 gala every Sunday night, during which a boy is eliminated every two weeks, and a girl is eliminated every other week. At the end, there's only a boy and a girl left, and there has to be a winner.  Anyways, Samantha Fox was at the gala tonight, performing 3 of her songs with the kids... and kissing one of the boys. Madonna and Britney, watch out, you have competition! I mean, it's almost as bad as a kiss between two of them, since Sam Fox is actually married to a woman, right?   Well anyways, the surprise is that I actually enjoyed the songs. Come on, the girl was a slut (even more than Britney, can you believe it?!), she couldn't sing, but her music was fun!   One would just think that she would have had a breast reduction...  But hey, she's the one probably having to deal with the back pain, not me!  Well, she's back, believe it or not!   Sam Fox during rehearsals, this afternoon     What's next? New success for  urlLink Def Leppard ?...

From the initial pose, which is this one...   Phalakasana  (Plank pose)     ...to the final pose, it took about one minute (with doing such crazy poses, you gotta go slowly!).  Who would have thought I would be strong enough for that?! Little Julie, 5 feet tall, not even 100 pounds (*touching wood*), strong enough to support her own weight for a whole minute?  Hell, I'm surprising myself!

      On Thursday, I asked for  urlLink more work .  Well I'm happy (yes, happy!) to report that my request has been met!   So I will be helping out the coordinator of publications, who has a lot of work on her hands.   See, I am a communications agent. I write letters, press releases, I coordinate the production of websites and printed documents (one-pagers, leaflets, advertisements, etc.)... Basically, I'm responsible for the content of the communications element (writing) and coordinate the production of the "package" with the webmaster or graphic designer.   So when I write a piece such as a press release, for instance, I write it, show it to my boss who gives me her comments and suggestions, adapt it to my boss' comments, then send it to the coordinator of publications, whose job is to read it and check for grammar and spelling mistakes. Then I send it to translation and, when it comes back, I send the translation to the coordinator of publications so she can proof-read the translation as well (because external translators sometimes make mistakes, not working in the organization and missing out on some subtleties, for instance). But the coordinator of publications is responsible for proof-reading whatever is written by a team of about 20 people -- who spend most of their time writing stuff! On top of that, she's responsible for writing, herself, the articles for a couple more publications.  So, I was asked to help her write some articles for the publications she's responsible for.  And , the most flattering of all, I was asked to help her proof-read some of the stuff she doesn't have time to do. My boss and her think my French  and  my English are impeccable (or well, for you English speakers, it may not seem  that  good, but for having studied it in school and just caring and being good at languages - they are my biggest strenght - I'm better than you're average Quebecker), so they asked me if I would mind helping with that and well... of course I don't! I'm flattered and happy to!   Some people may think proof-reading is boring. But when you have a passion for languages, it's  fun . And it's even  funner  (yeah, I know, the word is  funnier , but it's funner to say  funner ) when the texts you're correcting were not written by you!  So  yay!!!  for me!!!

      For all of you, yoga fans out there (yeah right, like there are tons!)...  I've just added links to a couple of yoga or yoga-related blogs:   urlLink Ashtanga Yoga Mysore Blog  is the blog of 4 California yogis who are spending a couple of months in Mysore, India, to study yoga with Pattabhi Jois, the guru of Ashtanga yoga.   urlLink Days In My Lives - An ashtanga practice journal  really is for the more experienced yogis... Its title is pretty self-explanatory, I think.   urlLink Sri Ganesha Tea & Book Stall   is a blog that I haven't had much time to explore yet, but seems very extensive about yoga and its philosophy.  On the Def Leppard side, I've also added a link to  urlLink Mental Meanderings , a blog maintained by Lep fan SouthernBelle.

       Question:  Who ever goes in a weekly meeting where everyone says what they are currently working on, and says that they  don't have enough work ?   Answer:  Me!  What is a stupid thing to do? I don't know. I just know that I have too much time on my hands to check the news and my mail, and that's not normal and it makes me feel like I'm not doing my job (which I would be doing if I had more pressure on!).  Am I gonna regret it? Maybe. We'll see!  I guess I'm loving this new job so much... I  want  to have a lot of work, so it can justify them keeping me at the end of my contract!

      For the last 2 years, I've been a subscriber to a series of cine-conferences about travel. On the program, this year: Portugal, Turkey, Siberia, Vietnam/Cambodgia/Laos, Sri Lanka & Maldives and Safari Kenya.  Today was the Safari Kenya conference. I always thought I'd love to go on a safari, but now I am more convinced than ever. I'm an outdoor girl. I like walking in the woods, I like fresh air, I like nature. The idea of being in the wild for 2 weeks, surrounded with monkeys, elephants, lions, giraffes and other wild animals doesn't really scare me. It rather attracts me. There are two types of safaris... You can either stay in some hotels, in the parks, where you find all the luxury and have to go out during the day to see all the nature. Or you can sleep in a tent, watching out for wild animals at night, scorpions on the ground, and babboons stealing your food.  And you know what? I'd love that! I used to be a girl scout. I'm not scared of walking in the forest alone, at night, with no flashlight. I've done wild camping at -15°C in late October (in Canada). To make some coffee in the morning, we had to go to the lake, break the ice, get some water, and boil it for 15 minutes on the fire... I  like  that kind of stuff. If I could make a living out of it, I'd do it.   So yeah, now I'm dreaming of a safari in Africa... It would be so fantastic... Maybe someday...

       Padmasana  (Lotus pose, here in the "bound lotus pose" variation)    Apparently, that's a very difficult pose for a lot of people.   I've always been able to do it.  The arms thing is a bit more tricky, but also doable...   Other variation: balancing on your arms, with your legs in the lotus position, not touching the floor. Did it last night for 15 breaths...

So looking forward to celebrating my 1/4th of a century with this multi-talented man!  There's another multi-talented man I would have liked to celebrate it, but as it's on a Tuesday, there's no chance he'll be here... So Phil Collins will have to do!

      After 3 months of planning a dinner with a friend and cancelling just about every week because one of us always had something that made it impossible, we finally managed to meet for the first time since December 18th.  Went to a typical mexican restaurant, in the Old Montreal (Pam, that would be a good address for you when you visit the city): la  urlLink Casa de Mateo . Amazing chicken fajitas, with tons of red pepper, guacamole, sour cream and salsa. Very beautiful restaurant, great atmosphere, very cozy (it was almost empty as it's the beginning of the week, but I hear it gets crazy on weekends, when they have mariachis playing music and stuff)... Service in Spanish (or in French/English but not unless you start speaking that language yourself. The intermediate-level Spanish speaker in me loved it.  We had a small table, by the window... the streets are so small in the Old Montreal, it felt like we were eating in a Parisian restaurant... you know, where there's almost no sidewalk and so it feels like your table is almost in the street. Absolutely charming. Took a short walk in the Old Montreal afterwards... we were tourists in our own city! Being amazed by the beauty of the neighbourhood and the amazing weather.  Great evening. And I know a Dutchboy who'll love this mexican restaurant.  Then came home and watched  24 , for the first time in over a month. All I'm gonna say is that I hope something like that never happens for real because damn, that must be the most horrible way to die.

      Anybody ever feels like this at the end of the weekend?  I promised myself I'd do a lot of things - study, among others - and I basically just sat on my big butt and did nothing (besides going to yoga on Friday night). Didn't study much, watched a lot of TV, cooked a bit, and that's about it.  Today, the weather was amazing, but I didn't have anywhere to go, so I looked out the window, without actually stepping outside.  And now the weekend is over, another busy week is about to start and I wish we were Friday again.  Classical.

      As Dutchboy said in his  urlLink latest post , we've been watching movies all week-end. Because well, there's nothing better than staying in with your boyfriend and watch movies under a nice blanket when you haven't seen him in weeks.   But now, we're running out of movies we agree on.  The Matrix ? Come on, if you know you hate it, why would you want to see it in the first place? Hate the first one, don't want to lose more time of my life watching the two other ones.  Texas Chainsaw Massacre ? Come on, useless blood and violence just for the fun of it? Not for me.  So maybe we'll watch some stupid shows on TV. Until SNL comes on. I don't mind. Because cocooning is so nice.

      Well, since Boston just scored and Dutchboy is passed out under jetlag, I thought I'd post a bit about homeopathy, for Micheal and just about anyone out there because it can help with any problem, really.  So, homeopathy is not yet recognized as an effective medicine, yet it has existed for hundreds of years and does seem to work in 2/3 of people who undergo a homeopathy treatment.   I was a bit skeptic when I started it, but being the "hippie" I am, I decided to give it a try. There's no way I'll go see a psychiatrist who'll prescribe me drugs. I'd rather be stuck with my anxiety attacks all my life than take any Valium, Prozac, Zoloft or whatever.   So, what the homeopath does is first ask you to fill a questionnaire. They want to know everything about you: lifestyle, diet, physical/mental problems... Just about everything you can think of. Then, you go in their office for a first meeting, that lasts between 3 and 5 hour. In there, you tell them your whole life. Really. It can be a very painful process, but you also learn a lot about yourself and the homeopath helps you see links between events in your life that you never knew existed. What the homeopath basically does is try to learn who you are, to find the remedy that corresponds to you. You will only have  one  remedy. This remedy corresponds to what you are, who you are, how you are, how you think, how you live, etc. This remedy is you.   The dose is very small. So small, in fact, that if the next day, doctors ran tests on you, they probably couldn't find any trace of it. The remedies are made from flowers, plants, minerals or animals extracts. They are all natural. You take it, most of the time just once, then continue living your life... The only difference is that you have to take notes of how you feel, mentally and physically, and what you dream about. You have to pay attention to things that may change in your life. The remedy is supposed to restore your inner balance. As it represents what you are, deep down, it means that your problems were caused by an imbalance, that the remedy corrects. At first, the symptoms can be worse than before you took your remedy. That's because the remedy actually  causes  the symptoms. But as two negatives cancel each other, the remedy will eventually "cancel" your symptoms.   It sounds a bit out there, and I was a bit skeptical at first, like I said... but really, I  am  seeing changes in my life and I am much happier and feel much better in my own body than I ever did before.   Homeopathy can be a bit expensive ($150 CDN for the first consultation, including the remedy), but it's worth it and has to be seen as an investment in your well-being. Anyways, a psychiatrist wouldn't be cheaper.  Anyways... I've seen a lot of people a blogs talk about stress and anxiety attacks. As someone who's been having them for the past 10 years, and also someone who's been claustrophobic and couldn't even be in a meeting at work without stressing out, I can tell you that the feeling of being in a meeting and actually feeling good and breathing normally is quite something... Worth going through the pain of having to live your whole life all over again to be able to tell it to a stranger.

      This morning,  urlLink Rodney posted his questions to me :  1. Who would you give the Nobel Peace Price to and why to this person? 2. What is the worst piece of clothing ever invented and why? 3. What is your most embarrassing moment?  My answers:  1. Right now, with what's going on in the news and the 10th "anniversary" of the Rwanda genocide, I'd have to say  urlLink Romeo Dallaire . For the last 10 years, Dallaire has been working against the killing of Rwanda people, speaking out loud about what's happened, and now he's getting criticized for not doing enough... all this by people from countries that refused to help because Rwanda had nothing to bring them (read: petrol). The guy does deserve the Nobel Prize.  2. High heels. Why? Because they ruin a woman's life, really! They hurt your toes to the point that they turn blue, they hurt your back so badly... And yet, men love the way a woman's body looks when she's wearing high heels, so women keep wearing them... Higher and higher. So much that, nowadays, it's almost impossible to find shoes that do  not  have high heels! They just don't make them anymore! So basically, a woman has to suffer every day of her life because her feet are killing her and shoemakers are all men... who want to see women wearing high heels. It's a curse, really!  3. Hmm... well, there have been a lot, but one I can think of right now is my first meeting with Mr. Phil Collen. It involved TheLLKid so, to make him feel bad, I'll tell it in this place! Neither of us had ever met any of the DL guys, although I had spoken to Phil on the phone once, during a DL convention in Las Vegas... We were at the hotel where the band was staying after a concert, and LL approached Phil, tapped him on the shoulder and said "Hi! I'm Brian... You don't know me, but maybe you actually know  her ...", then, he pushed me forward and hid behind me. Thanks dude! Then I had to say something like "Uh, yeah... you probably don't remember, but we spoke on the phone when I was in Las Vegas..." So of course, Phil being polite as always, he went "Yeah, yeah. I remember." I'm sure he didn't... The same night, I met Joe Elliott for the first time and the first thing I ever said to him was "Wow... you're soooo tall". I think my brain was malfunctioning that night.  Now, my 3 questions to  urlLink Michael .  1. If you could live anywhere in the world, other than in your own country, where would you want to live? 2. You have an accident tomorrow: you lose all your senses, except one. Which one would you most want to keep (touch, sight, earing, speech or smell) and why? 3. Besides from peace, what is, to you, the most important world issue? Why?

      Left work at 18.20 tonight... but strangely enough, I don't mind.  I took my homeopathic remedy about a week and a half ago and, believe it or not, I think it works (Michael, this is for you!). No more anxiety as I had before. I used to not even being able to go in a meeting without my heart pounding really hard in my chest. There is an explanation (there are like 10,000 them) but there is no real  reason  for that. And no matter how much I would tell myself that, my heart would still beat so hard that it felt like it would come out of my chest.   So last week, already, I could see the result. By the end of the week, meetings with closed doors didn't bother me so much anymore. I think I didn't even really think about it on the moment! Today, again, I had a meeting, that  I  was running. For the first time. It was a pretty small meeting, but still. Well, no heart pounding there. Barely a little butterfly in my stomach. Improvement.  I was skeptic about homeopathy, but I decided to give it a shot... I'm starting to believe it was a good thing!   On another note, 24 was just on. Great episode again. I wonder how Palmer's gonna get around that one! Thankfully, that's only fiction. Don't even want to start thinking about what it would be like if something like this virus happened in real life...  Oh, my first ever newspaper ad artwork was finished today (I worked on the content, a graphist worked on the presentation)... it'll be published in all borough newspapers of the island of Montreal next week. Can't wait to see it on paper!

      Is our world regressing? Have we forgotten the horrible events that took place all over Europe just 50 years ago?  How is it that today, in 2004, in a country like Canada, there can be so many anti-Semitic acts, first in Toronto, then in Montreal?  Last night, a  urlLink Montreal Jewish school was set on fire , just like that. Just because it's Jewish.   How ignorant, how stupid are we? How can someone, in their heart, have so much hate as to want to destroy a symbol of knowledge and understanding, just because it belongs to Jewish people? How could it even matter to us what religion our neighbour practices? Who gives a shit, really?   It's like the world has gone mad. Hell broke lose in Madrid, and now vandals are showing hate against people in Montreal and Toronto, with them being Jewish as their only excuse.   I don't want to start a whole discussion about religion because it could go on and on. Personally, I don't have a god. I have beliefs... They're not necessarily taken from my religion. I take what I want from my religion and let the rest go. I take what I want from Hindouism, I take what I want from Buddhism and let the rest go, etc. I choose to believe in what I want to believe in, and who cares if the guy next to me doesn't believe the same thing? They're not in my head, and I'm not in theirs. I have no reason to care.   Complaining against religious terrorism has become a big fashion in North America. We're afraid of what Al-Qaeda is willing to do for their god, destroying everything else. Yet, right now, Canadians - I'm ashamed to say it, but yes, Canadians - are doing exactly the same thing to Jewish people. It's on a much smaller scale, but it's the same.   Jewish people have suffered enough throughout the years. Some people are now complaining that they're whining too much about it, now that it's over. Well, it seems like it isn't. Couldn't we just give them a break and let them live?  Couldn't we just learn  tolerance  and  compassion ?

      A few months back, I was the one who suggested to  urlLink Dutchboy  that he goes see Kill Bill. I hadn't seen it myself, I had only heard really good comments about it, and I didn't know I was to trigger an obsession with him by suggesting this.  Then, weeks later, I saw it with him at the cinema. Liked it a lot. But wasn't so obsessed about it as he was.  On Tuesday, the movie came out. I ran (ok, drove) to Wal-Mart to buy two copies: one for me, and one to ship to my favorite Dutchboy. Came home, watched half of the movie (because I didn't want to go to bed too late). Absolutely  loved  the movie. Much more than the first time. Already knowing the story, I was able to pay more attention to the details: the images, the dialogues, the music, the special effects, everything. Brilliant. A real tribute to old kung fu and western movies. Funny, smart and artistic. Violent, yes, but not gross.   This morning, I had my final final exam (last one of my bachelor's degree). Came home afterwards, had a bite, and at 13.05 I was sitting in my seat at the cinema, to see  urlLink Kill Bill II .     Loved it, loved it, loved it. So much that I might go see it again on Monday night. I wasn't a fan of Tarantino especially before that. Now I'm thinking he might be the greatest movie artist ever. Really. Because that's what his Kill Bill movies are: real art. In all its forms...  But I need to see it again before I can go on... You should go see it yourself!

I guess I really tucked my tummy in, pushed my hip bones deep into the ground, and pulled on my legs... my body just lifted, almost by itself!  That's the beauty of yoga. You try something for months and months, it doesn't work. Then, one day, just like that, everything's changed and you finally understand that it can be that simple.  I'm proud of myself tonight. Just because logically, my body should tell me that I can't. Yet, I can.

The feeling you get while practicing yoga is difficult to express. I guess this image translates it better than any words ever could.     Wish I could keep that feeling with me all the time after practice.  Or wish I could practice every day to get a little bit of that feeling every day.

      Easter week-end just ended. It's supposed to be a spiritual - even religious - week-end.   I am a "godless" person, as some people may call it. I don't believe in the god the institution that is Church has manipulated us into believing in for so many centuries. I only go to church at weddings, funerals and christenings. But if I ever get married, it won't be in church. If I ever get children, they won't be christened either.   I have nothing against personal beliefs. Everyone is entitled to their own. I  do  have personal beliefs. Actually, spirituality has never been as important in my life as in the past 7 or 8 months. But I refuse to follow what the church says is right. Because I believe the church is wrong. I won't get into how and why, because everyone has their own opinion and is entitled to them. I think the church is wrong on many,  many  aspects. You may think not. You may even think that just me saying that is committing a gigantic sin. It doesn't matter. I don't care.  I have beliefs. I have a lot more beliefs than ever before. I meditate a lot. That is my way of praying. I wish for a lot of things. But I don't ask them to a "higher being". I ask them to myself. Because I believe that everything we have, we owe it to the work we do on ourselves and to who we are deep, deep down inside. Does that make me a moron?   Does that make me a hypocrite when I "celebrate" Easter? The Easter week-end is not just Easter anymore. It has become a civil holiday. A 3 or 4 day week-end that people use to get together with their family and friends, and come back from under the snow, I guess. It marks the beginning of the summer, that time of year when we start living and breathing again. Some people think Jesus resurected on Easter. Personally,  I  resurect. Easter is an occasion to stop - the first one, in 3 months after Christmas. Easter is a chance to take a deep breath before we run towards the summer holidays (which are still 3 months ahead), a chance to take a break or spend some time with people who are too far to make the trip on a regular 2-day week-end. Easter is all that, and who cares in what way we celebrate it, as long as we agree with the way  we 're spending it?  Anyhow, the week-end is now over... Back to the crazy life of school and work. Only one week, one exam and one paper left and I graduate, after 6 years of university and two degrees. About time. I'm sick of it.  Dutchboy went back to the Netherlands, and on my way out of the airport, I saw a woman carrying a carton holding some artwork from the Rembrandt museum, in Amsterdam. And there, it struck me. I had just dropped Dutchboy after his monthly visit and, as usual, it broke my heart. But this woman was coming  back  from Amsterdam, with that artwork under her arm... a souvenir from a place where she'll probably never go back. Yet, the person that I've been sharing my life with for over 3 years  lives  in that place that woman just visited for probably the first and the last time. Isn't that crazy and amazing?! Weird connection, but it just made me realize how much everything is relative, including calculated distance.  On a last spiritual note, it has been announced that  urlLink Prime Minister Martin  will  meet with H.H. Dalai Lama , after all. Even after threats to economic consequences from China, one of the major economic partners of Canada. This - along with the decision of not going to war in Irak - is one of the few decisions I'm proud my country has taken. Canada's a following sheep in a lot of aspects, but I'm always happy when they refuse to give in to threats like this. If that's not what we're an independent country for, then what for?

      One of my favorite music movies,  urlLink Almost Famous , was just on TV. I had planned on watching something else, but I decided to watch it anyways because I hadn't seen it in a long time and had actually been wanting to watch it recently.  Of course, it's as good as I even remembered it... all about music, love for music and the magic of actually getting to know your favorite band.   Makes me wish Def Leppard was on tour now. Because it's always a thrill getting to see a concert and what goes on behind the curtain...

       urlLink His Holiness the Dalai Lama  is  urlLink in the national capital for 3 days .  It is a very controversial visit. China has been  urlLink threathening Canada , saying that "if Canada values good trade relations with China", the Prime Minister will not meet the Dalai Lama. To which PM Paul Martin responded  "Screw you. I'm the prime minister and I will meet whoever I choose to meet."  Reaction to which I applaud and strongly agree with.   Of all the leaders in the world, there is no one who deserves more respect than the Dalai Lama. Living in India since leaving a Tibet invaded by China in 1959, the Dalai Lama never surrendered to the pressure of responding to the violence imposed on his people with more violence. He and his people have rather decided to take the loooooooong road; the road of patience, compassion and non-violence.   The Dalai Lama will be giving a big conference in Ottawa on Saturday, for which tickets are on sale. I resisted the temptation of driving 2 hours to go. I know I will regret it as soon as it is over. Why am I not going? I have a term paper to write, and Ottawa is 2 hours away. Also, I don't have anyone to go with. Don't want to drive 2 hours back and forth alone. But I know, I  will  regret not doing it to meet the one man I admire the most in the world.   I am happy that the government has finally agreed to meet him. I just find it sad that they refuse to address it as a political meeting. Because important countries like Canada, the USA, Great Britain, France, etc. need to stand up to China and tell them that their violent reign over Tibet has lasted long enough. But of course, China's like 10 times bigger than the USA, and Tibet has no petrol... so who'll face China and tell them they can't do it anymore?   In the meantime, the Dalai Lama and his people deserve our respect more than any other country in the world. Because they totally live up to their beliefs and are the best example of integrity. A concept that doesn't exist in our governments.

      Yeah right!  So today was my first official school-less Saturday. What did I do to relax?  9.30 - Wake up 11.00 - Yoga class 13.00 - Esthaetician appointment 13.40 - Get out of the appointment, drive to the mall to buy a wallet I'd seen a couple of days ago and really wanted. 14.01 - Get to the mall, buy the wallet. 14.10 - Leave the mall, drive to the drugstore. 14.26 - Get to the drugstore. 14.34 - Leave the drugstore. 14.40 - Get home. 15.00 - Leave home to go to the cinema. 15.50 - Movie starts (Kill Bill, what else?). 18.15 - Leave cinema 18.35 - Get home.  Times are approximate, but this really was my schedule for today. And I didn't even have time to get my winter tires changed for summer ones and my oil changed either!  When are the next holidays?...

      Ok, so  Friends  was all teary and stuff. I think it's necessary to close all the chapters that have been opened throughout the past 10 years. Tonight's jokes were pretty funny, I thought. Funnier than most Friends jokes lately. And I won't ruin it for those who haven't seen it yet, but I am very happy with where it's going... Can't wait to see the final next week (although I will be at the spa getting a floatation bath and a massage at the time it will be on... but I'll watch it when I get home).  Also watched the  Will & Grace  final. Don't watch that show every week, but pretty often. I thought the finale was pretty good, especially with Jennifer Lopez's appearance. I'm not a big J.Lo fan, but I thought she was pretty funny and knew how to make fun or herself in a cool way.   So I thought that was a great TV night, despite the Canadiens losing to Tampa Bay for a 4th time (bye bye guys!!!). Or maybe I'm just very very happy with my shopping...

      (Okay, so I was more depressed yesterday than today but still...)  You  know  you know the answer!  It's....  SHOPPING!!!   Yeah baby! Went shopping tonight. Spent a lot of money, but all on things that I needed, and I made intelligent purchases too.  Bought some nice Parasuco jeans. Needed a decent pair, and this one is so pretty and cheap too! Bought two nice tops too... Can be worn with classic pants, or with jeans. One pink, one white.  Then moved on to the shoe store! Bought a pair of black leather sandals, and a pair of black leather shoes. My old shoes  and  my old sandals were so deformed and used that I couldn't wear them anymore without having serious pains in my feet. So that's to say that every day was a painful one for my poor little feet. So I really needed those. And I'm all equiped for the summer now.  And... my favorite piece of all... a nice little XX Mexx red handbag. Love it, love it, love it. I'm trying to find a picture now, but I can't. I just had to buy it. See, I have this credit card with which I get $10 off in a big department store every month. Of course, they do that to bring you into the store, hoping you'll spend more than the $10. Well this month, the $10 is doubled to $20. The bag was $49.99, minue $20... So it really was $29.99 plus taxes. I  had  to buy it right? Cuz it's like making money. Really....  Well anyways, I'm very happy with my purchases, they are things I really really needed. And to top it off, it was a great TV night, which will be the subject of my next post...

      This definitely was an evening full of surprises.  Montreal losing to Tampa Bay (again) while they were winning over them at 30 seconds of the end of the game!  And... certain people doing certain things on 24 (I'm not gonna say so I don't ruin it for people who haven't seen yet).   Well, I guess we can say goodbye to Montreal, wish them a very nice golfing season, and maybe it'll go better next year.  As for 24... are we next Tuesday night yet?

      Sent my paper to the teacher this afternoon. I am now officially finished with school. It's not in my own hands anymore, there's nothing I have to do anymore.   I was able to do a dance of joy for like a minute this afternoon.  Then I collapsed on my chair and was exhausted again.  Tonight is my official lazy day. Came on at 17.45, changed into sweat pants and a t-shirt, had dinner, took a bath with some relaxing essential oils, and now I'm gonna sit my (not so) fat ass on the couch and do nothing for the rest of the evening.   Just because I  can  without feeling guilty about it.

      So last night was my little  "evening in heaven"  at the spa, with a floatation bath and a massage.  All I can say is  oh. my. god!   First experience in both. The floatation bath was great and went by much more quickly than I expected at first. But getting water in your eyes or mouth is  not  nice.   However, the massage was the greatest thing like,  ever !!! It's a bit embarassing at first, to be naked, alone in a room with a perfect stranger, but then you don't care anymore because they're a professional and they're making you feel  sooooo good . Of course, I had to have to pee really really bad 15 minutes before the end, so that broke the whole mood. But otherwise, it was absolutely fantastic. I was totally disorientated when she asked me to turn on my back. And that's when you know it works.  Fantastic night, though emotional. It's like yoga the first time. Afterwards, you want to cry and you don't know why.   Then came home and cried some more, watching the  Friends  finale.   I'm still a bit emotional from all that this morning.

      For the first time in several years, I've been doing nothing all day, and really not feeling guilty about it because I knew I didn't have homework I should be doing.  Sleeping until 10.30, going back to bed again at 11.15 because I was still tired, finally getting up at 12.30, watching a movie I've already seen 3 times or so. All this while enjoying it very much and not feeling guilty about it the slightest bit. It's great!!!  So I watched  The Bridges of Madison County . Girls, isn't it the best love story ever or what?!  So yeah. I spent the afternoon watching a girly movie and loved it...  I feel I'm gonna like not having homework anymore!

      As always, actually. Went to see  Kill Bill, Volume 2  at the cinema again this afternoon. Just to check if it was  that  good. It is.  Tomorrow, we're celebrating my grandmother's 80th birthday, in a fancy restaurant downtown. First of all, I hate fancy restaurants (unless it'd be for a romantic date). Second of all, I hate big family reunions. There is always someone to point out all my defaults and not mention any of my good shots (I'm still waiting for a congratulations from my parents for graduating university) and, most of the time, this comes directly from my father, who uses to most disdainful tone to mention my obsession with Def Leppard for instance (although, as much of a Def Leppard fan as I am, I barely ever listen to them and maybe mention them like once a week or something. It's not as if all I can talk about is DL)to ridicule me. So I am expecting to have a horrible time tomorrow. Every time we have a family gathering like this, I feel like I am 11 years old again and all I do is wrong because well, that's all I can do, right?  Hate it, hate it, hate it. I'm only going because I love my mamie and I know it'll make her and my grandfather happy. I don't see them a lot, as they live almost two hours away from here.  I wish the week-end was over! I know it sounds weird, but I'm really not looking forward to tomorrow...  P.S. Just rented  Master and Commander . Boooooooring. At least the 45 first minutes, as I couldn't bare watching more.

      Ok, so I've been quickly going through my blog archives (to see that some pages don't appear well because some pictures are too big for the main frame), and I saw my post about seeing  Kill Bill Volume 1  for the first time.  Here's a reminder of what I said:   So tonight I was dragged downtown to see Kill Bill Volume I. Violent, but good movie. I don't know, however, if I would say it's the best movie in 10 years.  I was told by various people that it grows on you to become even better. A friend said that 3 or 4 days after seeing it, she was finding it more and more interesting. And well, of course there's Mark who's seen it 4 times now and is completely obsessed with it...  Ask me what I think of it again in a couple of days.    Well, here's the final verdict, after having seen Volume 1 about five times (nothing compared to the number of time  urlLink Senff  has seen it!) and Volume 2 three times (so far, seeing it again on Saturday): - It  does  grow on you. - A  lot . - It  is  the best movie in 10 years. - Hell, it's the best movie  ever . In my opinion.  Last night, I received a present in the mail: the soundtracks for Volume 1 & 2. Listened to them in the car today. Fantastic music for fantastic movies. Officially the best movie (because it has to be seen as one  chef-d'oeuvre ) ever.   Says who? Says  me .

      It's been a while I haven't talked about yoga!  Well, because tonight I would really  need  a yoga class, although the next one is only tomorrow, I will talk about  yesterday 's class, just because I went much further into a pose than I ever did before.   Eka Pada Rajakapotasana  (One-Legged King Pigeon Pose)     Looks tough? Well it  is , too.   Of course, as you can imagine, there are many steps before you can grab your foot behind your head like this. First of all, you work on the legs. You have to be sitting on the floor. It's like doing the split, really. Not difficult for me. My legs are very flexible. I can do the  urlLink Lotus pose  without any problem, for instance.   But then, after having your legs like this, you have to lift up your upper body. Your hips have to keep facing the wall (or whatever is) in fron of you, you can't allow your body to roll on either side either. So you lift up your upper body. That's step 2.  Until yesterday, that's the last step I could go to with still being comfortable. The thing is, by lifting up your upper body, you're creating a backbend. And since I have to steel rods in my back, it doesn't bend much. Difficult one for me.  Step 3 is bending your knee (of course, the one that is behind), grabbing your ankle with your hand, and pulling your ankle towards your back. Until yesterday, I couldn't do it without my upper body falling to the ground, or rolling on either side.   But last night I did it! Very slowly, I'm learning to open my back... which is fused and shouldn't be flexible anymore! Go figure. Of course, I was very happy I could get this far. Evolution in yoga is what makes it so great. Because of course, there is no point in doing something if you do it to the perfection the very first time!  I won't even let this success be over-shadowed by the fact that my sister was able to wrap her inner elbow around her ankle, pull her foot ever closer to her back, lift her free arm, put it behind her head and grab the hand of the arm that was holding the leg! Sounds tiring?! I'm sure it is! But hey, at least I have the consolation of knowing that only two of 24 people in the group were able to do it this far!

      What we've been seeing in the medias about the war in Irak the past couple of days has been so very troubling.   Bush got into this war without the international community's approbation, thinking he was strong enough to handle this all alone and do what he wanted, and he's definitely proving that he's not.   We're seeing the worst attrocities in  both  camps and that shouldn't be surprising... it's war, after all. But it is. Because we're all humans, and no soldier, Iraki or American, deserves to lose his humanity by being walked around naked on a leash while other people are laughing and taking pictures, or beheaded with a simple knife while other people are filming the execution.  I just had to turn off the TV because I couldn't stand hearing the screams and seeing the images of this execution over and over again. I don't need to see or hear it, yet I know it's necessary so that somebody wakes up and makes it stop.  On both sides.   It really is time to stop the madness. Couldn't Bush just stop thinking he's the king of the world and hand the matter over to the UN like he should have in the first place? Is that what he meant when he said last year that it would take just a few weeks and he would liberate Irak?   I don't have any solution to propose; it's not my job. But the situation has degenerated really badly, on both sides, and I think it's time to switch to plan B because plan A is  not working .   Off to try to clear the images of those Iraki prisoners, naked, humiliated by American soldiers of my head... Also off to try to clear the images and the sounds of this American being executed of my head... But I think they'll stay in there forever, just like the images of the those poor people jumping off the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, trying to escape the worst of two deaths.

      So I got up this morning, and it was rainy outside. A bit depressing.   But  it was also denim day (to the benefit of breast cancer) so that I meant I got to wear my jeans to the office... on a Tuesday! Ain't that cool? Or well, it's nothing, but it's enough to put me in a good mood.  When I left home for work, the sun came out and the rain started to dry out. Finally, the sun was totally shining when I got downtown. The air was so fresh from all the rain that had fallen during the night, and the tree leaves are coming out at an impressing speed since the last few days... It felt so good, it really was spring.   How can you not feel good when the day is so beautiful?  All morning, I had tons of energy. Maybe a bit too much! People were like  "You seem so happy today, what's up?!"  all day. But I had no explanation. I just felt good.  Then I realized. I took my homeopathy remedy last night, for the second time, but at a much higher dose than the first time (the first time, my homeopath was just testing to find out if it was the right remedy for me and she didn't want to give me a dose too strong because it can give you really strong emotions the first time you take it). Could be the reason why I felt so good today. Like on a natural high. Totally natural because my remedy (phosphorus, in my case) is actually working on making everything that goes wrong with your body right, by rebalancing it. So if that's a preview of what I should feel like when everything right with my body, then bring along the phosphorus!  I hope tomorrow will be a day as nice as this one...

      9.20 a.m.  I'm still waking up, sipping my bio & fair trade coffee, reading the news -- which is part of my daily routine at work, since my work is so affected by what's going on in the actuality.  The phone rings. It's my boss.  Boss -  Julie, there's an emergency. I'm at the Queen Elizabeth  (the hotel where Yoko Ono and John Lennon had their famous bed-in and wrote Give Peace A Chance) , [our president] is giving a speech in a few minutes and I forgot the speech on my desk.   Me -  Ok?...   Boss -  You have to go get it, jump in a cab and bring it to me. I need it within the next 5 minutes.   I work in the World Trade Centre building, like 10 minutes by foot from the Queen Elizabeth. Maybe even less. But there's no time to walk.  I grab my coat, grab the speech and my purse, and run to the elevator.   The receptionist goes  Where are you going like that? .  Me -  To the Queen Elizabeth! They forgot to bring the speech!   Outside, there's a line up of cabs waiting for customers. But the cab drivers are not actually  in  the cabs! I manage to get the attention of one and go  Quick! I need to be at the Queen Elizabeth in like 5 minutes! .  Poor cab driver was in shock I think. A young lady so stressed out, so early in the morning. Or maybe he was just upset he couldn't just chat with his pals anymore.  Anyways, we got to the hotel on time (although I forgot to ask the driver for a receipt because I was in too much of a hurry). Right on time, actually: the president got there like 30 seconds after me!  My boss told me how much she loved me (!) and I left.   Outside, the cab was waiting for me. I asked him for a receipt, and told him I was going to walk: I needed the fresh air and the walk to calm down.  - End of story. -  Pretty cool, eh?!   And Julie saved the day.  Haha!

      I'm  not  stupid.  There is a reason why I took that spoonful of olive oil: doctor's order. I have to add one to two spoonfuls of olive oil to my diet, every day. (I finally found a doctor who prefers the holistic approach than administering medication right away!)  But yesterday, I didn't eat anything that went with olive oil. So I thought I'd try to just drink it, and see how it tasted. The result came back negative.  Not good.   So, here's my idea:  Help my digestive system work better; send me all your olive oil recipes!  I'm not a good cook, I only have so much imagination when it comes to food...  So submit your recipes to this  urlLink address !

      For the past couple of years now, my parents haven't even been able to spend Christmas with us, their children.  Today, they didn't even bother to show up for dinner (I live with them. Unfortunately.).  So much for trying so hard to buy my mom a nice present she'll love.  I can count the  years  since the last time we went to a restaurant together.  Why bother? If my parents can't care about their children, then I'm not gonna care about my parents either.

      I'm tired. I predict my whole body's gonna hurt like hell tomorrow.  Started this morning with different kinds of meditations, for about an hour. Then worked on some asanas (poses) for the rest of the morning:  urlLink upward-facing dog ,  urlLink headstand , and jumping from  urlLink Uttanasana  into  urlLink Chaturanga Dandasana  and from  urlLink downward-facing dog  into  urlLink Uttanasa . Not to mention numerous sun salutations.   Came home from lunch and I was already exhausted. But of course I was looking forward to going back. So we started the afternoon with some exercises about ourselves: having someone asking us "who are you" for 5 minutes and, each time, having to give a different answer in less than 3 words; writing a "should" list of all things you should be doing (mine was more than a page long); then figuring out what your purpose is in life. And that's when I realize that if there is one thing that I have to do in this life, it's to learn to be happy with the body I was given, feel comfortable in that body and in my head, and learn to not be so hard on myself, work on myself and learn to think about myself and do things for myself. Maybe it sounds selfish, but it's actually a very difficult thing to do. We tend to always do things for other people, to make other people happy, and often forget about ourselves. It's easier to look at others than looking at ourselves and seeing all the crap in our life. So that's my goal in life. At least for now.  After that, we worked on the  urlLink triangle pose , the  urlLink revolved triangle pose , the  urlLink half moon pose , and some other poses as well. We ended with an amazing session of  urlLink yoga nidra , during which I fell asleep, as usual.  I'm exhausted tonight, but I'm looking forward to going back tomorrow, as I am learning like crazy. It's not like we spent 6 hours today practicing. We stop, watch others and learn a lot.   Love it. What an amazing way to spend a week-end (although I'm gonna have another kind of very amazing week-end next week... but that's another story, and I won't talk about it so much)...

      Even if it's  "just stretching"  to some.  I'm too tired to talk about the first evening of my 3-day yoga workshop. I'll just say that it's amazing, and that I did a wonderful handstand, with only someone's fist between my calves as I was pushing on it to hold me up! The feeling is absolutely fantastic when you realize you can do it so perfectly!

      Nowadays, people have new ways of meeting new love interests. People meet on the Internet, on TV reality shows, on radio contests, through newspapers...   Nowadays, people also have new ways of celebrating their love. One of my collegues and office roommates (we share the same office with another girl) met her boyfriend on the Internet about 15 months ago. They lived 10 minutes apart, took the same bus, the same train, worked in the same area, in the same field, often had lunch at the same places, sometimes on the same days, but only with the Internet did they meet for real.  Exactly one year after they meet, he proposed to her. On a TV show. She was a contestant in a game show, she made some joke about asking permission to propose to her boyfriend on the show (the boyfriend wasn't at the taping, he had other things to do that day). The show researchers took her seriously, managed to find the boyfriend, told him that if he wanted to propose to her on TV, he had 2 hours to buy flowers, get a shave, dress nicely and get to the studio. He did. They surprised her, he proposed to her on national TV.   Now, they are planning the wedding. Which means I am also planning it, by association. I mean, I work with the girl, 5 days a week. We share the same office. It's almost as if  I  am getting married, sometimes! I was almost as excited as her when he proposed to her! I was almost as happy as her when she received her ring! I'm so happy about her wedding dress, and the place where she's chosen to have the reception... You know, girls stuff.  Well my friend and collegue, so in love with her man (damn, they are  so  sweet with each other that sometimes it's sickening! It's like,  "Come on! You wake up together in the morning, you meet for coffee break at 10.30, you go for lunch together at noon, and you spend all your nights together!  Some people are trying to have a very long distance relationship here! " ), is also very traditional and romantic. So traditional and romantic that she's cheesy to the extreme, but she doesn't care because she's happy. And good for her!  So, to keep in the line of "Internet meeting" and "TV proposal", she decided to apply on this  Oui je le veux  show (means "Yes I do"). Basically, it's your Quebec version of  A Wedding Story . She thought it would be funny, considering the circumstances, and that it would make a good documentary about their wedding, for them to watch together and show their kids in years from now, or something. The thing is, the show received 500 applications and are only producing 26 shows this year. All couples selected had to get married before September 1st. However, my friend is planning on getting married in October (Indian summer's such a beautiful time!). But their story is so great that the producers decided to make an exception and accept them as well. She found out today.  How cool is that?! I mean, it's something I would  never  do. But  they  want to do it, they're happy about it, and they don't care if it's cheesy because any love  is  cheesy anyway. And if it isn't, it's boring. How crazy is it? Meet on the Internet, propose on TV, get married on TV.   Maybe I'm gonna be on TV too? Maybe they'll want to see the supportive collegues who were with her through all this? I think they should come to our office, so appropriately baptised  "Femme Depot"  because 3 chicks work there and it's full of oestrogen (I keep my tampon box on my desk to make it clear that once you enter the office, you have to talk about make-up, babies, shoes, and menstruations), and we'll tell them the whole story. Because we're all so girly and we think it's such a romantic story!  That's love in the multimedia age for you... and who better to understand it than 3 chicks who work in communications?   Damn, I love my job, and I love working in  Femme Depot ! How many people can really say they get along perfectly with all of their collegues? Once you have that, you never want to leave it...

      Today was an extremely busy day at work. There were some layoffs a couple of days ago, and the announce of a whole direction of services closing in July, and for the communications department, it means re-thinking the whole branding image and re-doing all the communications tools and this, before July. So that's a  LOT  of work. But that's fine because I love my job, and although people losing their jobs because their direction of services is closing  is  sad, it brings us a  very  interesting challenge and it's actually pretty exciting.  But not only am I so busy at work, but I'm also really busy on evenings. Tonight, I was supposed to have dinner with a friend, but she cancelled this morning. Called another friend during the day, and hoped to be able to have coffee with her tonight, but she didn't call back. She must have been busy. So I got the night off today. But tomorrow, I have yoga. Wednesday? Yoga. Nothing on Thursday so far, then, what I've been waiting for so long...   *drum roll*   Yoga seminar, for 3 entire days!    urlLink Hart Lazer  is a teacher from Winnipeg (Canada), who has been travelling around the world, teaching yoga, for years. He's the one giving the seminar at my yoga studio this week-end. Apparently, a week-end with him is a life-changing experience. I am really looking forward to doing yoga for 3 days, learning to push my limits even further and quiet my mind even better.   As I said before, I love my job (I really do!) but am I finding out (and not afraid to admit it) that I am really not made for this kind of stressful, work-orientated, life. I know most people can handle it or at least  pretend  they can handle it. I don't, and I'm not gonna pretend. Instead, I'll just try to find ways to help me deal with it better (i.e. yoga, meditation and a healthy lifestyle), so I can keep on doing the job that I love, despite all the stress it brings me. This workshop should help me get even better in that aspect. I am really looking forward to it.  With a little bit of luck, I'll be able to do one or two more really difficult poses, like this one, at the end of the week-end:   Parivrtta Trikonasana  (Revolved Triangle Pose)    And the good thing is that I have the day off on Monday (Queen's Day), to help me recuperate from this whole week-end of... recuperating!

      Well, brunch with family didn't turn out to be so bad, after all.  Saw two cousins whom I hadn't seen in I'd say about 5 years (and we're a small family, so they're cousins I used to be close with) and that was really nice. It's a bit ridiculous considering we're all from Trois-Rivières, a city about 90 minutes away from Montreal, but we all live in Montreal and have been living here for quite a couple of years, yet we never saw each other before today. But, as one of my aunt said today, the bridges are being built again and I really hope I'll see them again, for a beer at the International Jazz Festival or something like that.  Also met my cousin's girlfriend, and their 6-month old baby. I didn't get to talk much to my cousin's girlfriend because there were so many people there and of course all the attention was on her and the baby, but I'm really hoping to see her again and, who knows, maybe become friends with her. She's about my age (and my height!) and she seems very sweet... I'd like to be friends with her.   And the baby... of course, my uterus turned upside down when I saw her. She's the cutest little thing. Very small (as weightless as a feather), huge blue eyes and she laughs and smiles  all the time . I had never seen her before, she was across the room from me, ended up looking at me and extending her arms at me, smiling and laughing... so of course she ended up in my arms, and it was just so sweet.  (Anyone can hear my uterus sighing right now?)  So it was really nice, actually, I got to see some people that I really care about (cousins I used to be close with) and that I hope I'll see again soon. I might have to make the first steps and actually call them for a coffee or something -- otherwise, it may never happen -- but it's worth it. I'll do it.  Then drove back home, going from one end of the city to the other, only to realize that Montreal is  such  a pretty city (especially in the smaller neighbourhoods), especially at spring, like this, with the trees and the grass  so  green, the lilac trees behind the Place des Arts  so  beautiful and full of flowers, the city so alive on a Sunday afternoon. I only wished that a certain someone had been with me to appreciate all this, because it's that kind of random, momentary instant of happiness that you want to share with someone you love.  Not a bad day, after all...

      I know tomorrow's only Thursday, but for me it's week-end already?  For the first time since Easters, I'll be with Dutchboy for a couple of days, and so that means week-end for me. Of course there'll still be work and all, but it'll still be week-end.  Movie week-end, maybe? Gotta see  Kill Bill Volume 2  for the 5th time. I mean, gotta see it with Mr. Kill Bill Obsessed, right? Then, I want to see  Shrek 2 . Been waiting for this one for long enough already! And there was talk about going to see  The Day After Tomorrow  as well.  Now, I don't like catastrophe movies much.  Armaggeddon  is a Def Leppard song, not a movie. Or well, it's a movie but a pretty sucky one.  Deep Impact ,  Ice Storm , etc. They're all the same.  Independence Day  was a bit good because it was funny. But that's it. I'm willing to give  The Day After Tomorrow  a try but there are no high expectations there. But hey, it'll be fun, so why not?!  Now, the week after that, the movie I've been waiting for since last November is coming out, but that'll be a post of its own later next week...    Also today, read  Yoga vs Yoga  in  urlLink Julie's Lotus Garden .

      I won't give any clues as to what happened for those who haven't seen it yet, but I'll say I give the finale a 10. Lots of action and suspense, just enough emotions.  Great show... not always consistent, sometimes a bit unreal, but always entertaining, and that's why I think   24   has been the best show on TV these past 3 years.   Can't wait for it to come back next January (yeah! we'll have to wait that long!).  What am I gonna do now without  Friends  and without  24 , my two TV highlights of the week?  More yoga?

      Well, a sub-section of this blog was just created:   urlLink Julie's Lotus Garden   I thought I would use this sub-section to talk about my yoga practice, and keep the main blog for all the rest.  Chances are the updates here will be a bit less frequent and maybe shorter. But at the same time, those of you who couldn't care less about yoga won't have to read it, and those of you would care a lot about yoga will get to read more about it. Mostly, it'll give me a place to document my yoga practice; some sort of specialized online journal.  Hope some of you will find some peace in that quiet garden!

      Michelle asked how I got so involved in yoga.  Well, if someone asks me to talk about yoga... I'll be glad to do it!  I tried yoga for the first time in last September. I had been wanting to for a long time, but I didn't know if I would like it, nor if I would even be able to do it. I only knew that I have anxiety troubles that I wanted to learn to deal with (and believe me, at first, even going to yoga class created anxiety for me!), and I wanted to find a soft way to get in shape. I thought yoga would be a good thing to try.  So I called up the yoga studio near my home, just to find out some information. The lady I spoke to was so nice and comforting. She told me she was sure I'd be able to find a kind of yoga for my needs. She said  "You don't adapt to yoga. Yoga adapts to you."  Her voice was so soothing, I was relaxed just by this phone call!  So I reserved my place for a hatha yoga class, which she suggested to me. When I got there on the first night, the manager, Helene (who also happened to be the lady I spoke to on the phone), was there to greet everybody. Then, she stayed for the whole class, right next to me, helping me find alternate positions for the things I wasn't able to do.   I found out later that, when she comes, she leaves as soon as the class starts. So now I know she must have stayed just for me, making sure I was alright.  After that first class, I cried all the way back home, alone in my car. I had never felt anything like this before. For the first time in my life, I felt amazingly good in my body, despite the fact that there were a lot of things that I couldn't do like the others.   That was early September. By late October, I was already taking 2 classes a week.  Now, because of my anxiety problems, I am the kind to chicken out on a lot of things. Not yoga. Never yoga. I never missed a class. When I couldn't be at one, I would make up for it by going at a different class in the same week. Yoga became sacred to me, very quickly. Yoga became my feel-good, alone time. I always look forward to yoga, even when I'm tired or feeling a bit sick and would rather go to bed or something. I know that after yoga, I'll feel better, full of energy. And I always do.  I started attending all the special workshops offered at my yoga studio. "Finding your true self", "Anti-stress workshop", etc. Those are usually like $35 for one afternoon. When I heard about this week-end's workshop, I hesitated for a second because it was more expensive ($225) but then again I so wanted to take it. So I thought the hell with it, I'm offering myself a present because I deserve it. And I'm so glad I did.   As I said in one of yesterday's posts, this week-end was absolutely amazing. It's almost as if I had a revelation: yoga is something I want to do all my life. It's also something I would like to do to make a living. It is so interesting. I mean, it's about exercising, it's about philosophy, it's about biology. You learn about ancient stories, you learn about beliefs, you learn about energy, you learn about the human body, you learn about so many different things...   I love my actual job. I really love what I do. But it's also very stressful, and I don't think it's something I could endure for the next 35 years of my life. I know I'm not made for this kind of life. I don't handle stress well. I get physically ill when I'm too stressed out. And I now know that my goal in life is to learn to feel better about myself, accept my body better and feel better in it, and all that comes with that. I love the place I work at right now. They are so human and so much fun to work with, and it's in an economic/political environment, which I love. But if I had to change jobs, I think I'd go for something totally different, something not in the communications field, something not in an office -- probably something related to yoga or well-being. Because life is made to be enjoyed and there is no point in working for a company that doesn't care for you nor for the work you do for them. Right now, the organization I work for is better than any organization I ever thought I could work for. But I know such great organizations don't exist in large numbers, and I probably never will find such a great place. Then, if I had to change, I don't think I'd stay in the same world.  Yesterday, I found out that my yoga studio will be offering a teacher's training course, with my favorite teacher, and the teacher who was giving the workshop this week-end. So perfect for me because it'll offer me a chance to go deeper into my study of yoga and maybe one day live from it. It'd be amazing.  If you want to do yoga more, then go for it. I think it's a life-changing practice, and for me it's just what I  need right now. For the first time in my life, I am feeling a little bit good in my body and my head, and that's because of yoga. Yoga is more than a sport. It's a discipline, it's a way of life. When you start doing yoga, you start wanting to take care of yourself more, you start wanting to eat right (and if you already eat right, you start wanting to eat even better), you start wanting to treat others better too, and most of all, you start wanting to do all this for the rest of your life. So if you want your life to change, at least on the inside, then go for it. Yoga's the best discovery I ever made.

      It's this time of the year when all the flowers come out, trees become green again, the grass grows long, and everything smells so good.  I used to think that lilacs were nasty flowers. Don't know why. Or well, maybe I do. When I was about 3 years old, we were living in some old house, kinda ugly, and it has a lilac tree growing in the driveway. Like, almost growing out of the asphalt or something. So I guess I thought they were nasty flowers, almost like weed that you had to get rid of, or something.  But I'm finding out that they're the most beautiful flowers! Because they're so simple, they come out just at this time of the year when you  need  to see flowers or you'll go mad and you can just enter a room and, without seeing them,  guess   there are lilacs in the room because they smell so good and so much.  Last year, my parents planted a very small lilac tree in the backyard. This year, it's grown bigger already, and it's given us  one flower . Well this afternoon, I decided that there was no point in letting the single flower in the tree if nobody was going to enjoy it, so I cut it, placed it in a glass of water and I'm taking it to whatever room I'm in, just because its smell gives you the impression of breathing better.   Lilacs are such beautiful flowers...

      So the yoga workshop is over. Already. I'm exhausted, and emotional, and happy.  What an experience. Totally worth the money. I learned so much, and not just about physical poses, but about how the body works, and how our minds work.   As I said in last night's post, it allowed me to find out my way -- which is to work on myself and learn to be happy with the body I've got, and the mind I've got, and not to be so hard on myself and on others. Just that can be the work of a whole lifetime.   Last night, when I came home, I started surfing the web for yoga philosophy classes, or meditation that would be given in Montreal so that I could attend. Because I'd love to become a yoga teacher, but I thought that because of my physical problems, I should go more towards meditation, philosophy or prayanama (deep breathing). Well today, I was practicing in between two of my teachers (the two owners of the studio), and one of them kept telling me how great I was doing and stuff. So I told her how much I loved it and how much I wished I could make a living out of it, as opposed to have a stressful office life (not that I don't like my job, I love it actually, but I am not made for this kind of stressful life). So she said that, actually, her and Hart Lazer (the guy who was giving us the workshop this weekend) would start a 300-hour teacher training program in April 2005. Then she said that people like me, who overcome important problems and everything, make the best teachers. She said I should sign up for the program, if I'm really interested.  How perfect is that?!?! I was exactly looking for that kind of program, and now my teacher (whom I love to work with) will be giving one, at the studio where I practice twice a week!! I am just so happy, you have no idea.  I was going to try a flamenco class at the end of June, see if I like it. But not anymore. I will spend more time and effort on yoga, instead. Read more about it, practice it more, enjoy it's amazing effects more. I don't need a new hobby, I already have the most perfect of all (at least perfect for me). And if one day I can make a living out of teaching other people how to use yoga to feel as good as yoga is making me feel, then I'll be completely satisfied.  Pose of the day was  urlLink bridge pose . Always an amazing feeling when you come out of it, realizing you can actually do it although it looks so hard!

      Just came back from the theater, from seeing  urlLink Harry Potter , of course.  Pure moment of happiness. It's so nice because everyone is starting to know the characters so well (from having read the books or seen the movies or both) and so there's always this sense of familiarity. You see the bond between Hermione and Ron develop (who doesn't want these two to end up together?!), Emma Thompson is hilarious in Professor Trelawney, David Thewlis is such a great Professor Lupin, of course Gary Oldman is amazing in Sirius Black and, my favorite, Alan Rickman in Professor Snape... there just isn't enough of him. Come on, you know you just  have  to say Harry Potter using his cold, snappy accent. Love him.  Loved the whole movie... quite different from the first two ones, as the threat is so much more abstract. They kids are growing up, and it's just a delight to be watching them grow. Now I have to go back and read the books. Especially  The Prisoner of Azkaban . It's the best one. Too bad they couldn't make a movie that lasted 10 hours or something. They had to leave so many things out. It doesn't suck; it's just sad. For 2 h 20 min, I was sitting there, watching the movie with a big smile on my face. I could have taken a lot more.  My wishes for the next one: a lot more of Sirius Black (to see more of Oldman's great acting, which wasn't explored nearly enough in this movie) and Severus Snape (because we've already established that he's my favorite character... with Ron, for whom I would go back to being 15 if I could 'cause he's just the cutest thing...).  See what I mean:      Will have to go back to get some more of this wonderful feeling Harry Potter brings to adults as well as children...

      Today, I decided to do something very nice for myself, because I deserve it and because I love me. The sun was shining so beautifully, for the first time this week, I kinda felt good, we were having fun at the office, a bunch of collegues (including our boss) sitting in our office for almost an hour just talking about everything -- except work.  I had an appointment with a supplier in printing for some stuff I need to have produced, and he came into the office with a bunch of flowers, and gave a few flowers to about any woman he saw. He said he did it just because the weather was so nice and it felt so great.  I thought that was such a good idea and couldn't content myself with the 3 or 4 flowers I received... so after work, a collegue and I walked to a florist shop nearby. She bought some flowers for her grandmother she was going to visit, and I bought myself some flowers as well. Just because I'm nice and I love me.   And I'm really happy with my yellow daisies I bought myself. Why wait until someone gets them for you? You want them, you get them. Because you're worth it.

      Since my phone company are crooks and, as of lately, have been charging me almost $0.55/minute for my calls to the Netherlands (it's not as if I speak to Dutchboy an hour a day, but let's say I call him for 5 minutes a day, that sums up to more than $75 a month!), I decided that they sucked and that I was going to change my phone for a company that offers me calls to the Netherlands at $0.30/minute. That also meant I had to get a new phone (because of course they won't let you keep a phone bought from a competitor!). Which sucks in a way, because it means spending more money, but having a new toy is always fun.  And what fun for me, with my new  urlLink Sony Ericsson Z200 !!! Yes, yes, I am a fashion victim and I fell for this cool model... But I really wanted a flip phone, and this was pretty much the cheapest... All other models were not flip but, most importantly, cheap. As in not resistant at all. Or at least didn't seem like they were.      So now I'm home (from buying the phone and seeing Shrek 2... which is really great, btw!), and I gotta go play with my new toy!

      Slept a lot last night (almost 9 1/2 hours) and woke up feeling better, but of course the sore throat wasn't completely gone and tonight, I am tired (although it's not like I dragged myself from one place to the other all day). Still sore throad, small headache and everything.  I should be going to yoga class tonight. Actually, I have really been looking forward to it, since I didn't do any since last Wednesday (Dutchboy was in town). But I think I'll be reasonable and not go. Just because I would like to go to bed early again, to be able to get through this week without feeling like total shit. It's only logic, no? Remedy for sore throat: lots of sleep, lots of liquids (especially warm ones) and yes, salty water... I'd love to go to yoga, but I'll be a good girl and I'll get some rest.  I'll go back to yoga on Friday and Saturday. At least then, the work week is over and it doesn't matter as much if I don't feel too good. But hopefully, my throat will be better by then.  And with this, I'm off to watch a bit of TV, read a bit and then go to bed before sunset!

      Well, the party's over. Dutchboy has gone back to his Dutchland and it pretty much sucks.  But the good news is that I now have time to blog. Not that I didn't have time over the week-end, I just had other priorities.  It was a nice and cozy week-end, filled with lots of movies.  urlLink The Day After Tomorrow  on Friday,  urlLink Kill Bill Vol. 2  (for a 5th time!) on Saturday. Also saw  urlLink Love Actually  for a second time, and  urlLink Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers  as well as  urlLink Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King .That'll make for a great week-end of cocooning. As if I'd want to do anything else when it's been almost two months since Dutchboy's last visit.  I've linked all those movie titles to Dutchboy's new movie blog:  urlLink ACTION! Senff's movie reviews . Because I pretty much agree with all his reviews on these specific movies. Lord of the Rings, for instance... Tried reading  Bilbo The Hobbit  many years ago, because my sister was so crazy about the Tolkien books. Never got past page 100. Saw the first movie in the cinema when it came out, and although I enjoyed it then, I was never able to watch it again (I can watch movies I like over and over again). I just found it too boring. The second and third movies are entertaining all right, but there are way too many battles, way too much violence, way to much Gollum arguying with himself back and forth. Seriously, that's a 10-hour series they could have easily done in one 3-hour movie. All these different battles are good for litterature, but I don't think they translate well into cinema. They just get boring instead. I'm not saying it's a bad movie. I'm just saying it's too long for nothing.  This week, it's gonna be Shrek 2 and Harry Potter... C-a-n-n-o-t w-a-i-t for Harry Potter! Now that's one Dutchboy and I don't agree on. But Harry Potter rules and no one will make me change my mind. We'll see if I can beat my Kill Bill Vol. 2 record for the number of times I've seen it at the cinema...

      I would have a lot of things to say, but the weather's so nice outside and since I don't have to be at the computer at all this week-end (the only reason I use it nowadays is blog, a few emails and chat with Dutchboy -- and Dutchboy is away for the week-end), I feel like just taking a week-end off, doing nothing but watching TV, cooking (with positive results so far... quite a miracle in my case!) and reading in the sun.   Started reading  urlLink The Clan of the Cave Bear . Should keep me busy for a little while.

      Because people who hate their jobs must get really pissed off by days like the one I just had.  I didn't have one foot through the door this morning that my boss was already telling me to go right away in the vice-president's office... who had a really cool, but really urgent project for me. Work on this like crazy all day.  Crazy , I'm telling you. I'll spare you all the details, but it really was the kind of thing that literally made me breathless because I had to be everywhere at the same time.  But thankfully, I love my job, so I actually really enjoyed my day and I had fun. The only thing that pissed me off a bit is that we had a fire drill at 10.15... Couldn't they have picked a better day?!?   ***  On another note, I can't believe what I'm hearing lately: the Conservative party would consider making abortion - an acquired right here in Canada (I know that some of you are pro-life and I don't want to start a debate because we all know it can get ugly, but I'll just say that I am very strongly pro-choice) -  an issue in the electoral campaign, as well as gay marriage and official bilinguism of the country (they would go against it). Damn, I hate those liberals for what they did with the sponsorship program, but they really are the lesser of two evils... How can it be said that we have a "choice" now when comes to the time to vote for our government? We don't. We have to chose between bad and badder. That's not what I call a choice.

      Thanks to the magic of DVD, I am now in the process of watching -- for oh, about the 25th time -- the greatest French Canadian series of all times,  Les Filles de Caleb .     Yes ladies, this is Roy Dupuis, 15 years ago, back when he was a wonderful secret only known to us, French Canadians...

      Well, I saw Harry Potter for a third time in as many days.  Fun, or pathetic?  Maybe a bit of both.  But frankly, I think it's more fun. Yesterday, I went to see the movie again because I was bored after a whole day alone at home and had to get out to avoid depressing more.  Today, me and the two girls I share my office with - the girls from  Femme Depot  - decided to make it a girls night out and go see it together. I get along so well with my two office roommates/collegues... It was just a lot of fun. And I'm making new friends which are more than office friends since we actually go out outside of office hours, and that's fun.  I'm especially close to one of them, we're very much alike.  Which reminds me that back in November, I saw a card reader who predicted about everything that happened to me so far this year, including that I would meet a dark, brown girl with whom I would have a great friendship... I'm not saying that I believe in anything a card reader would tell me, but it that turns out to be true, she was talking about this collegue.  Gotta love actually having fun at work.

      Nothing special to say about today. It was rather boring.  Since  urlLink Dutchboy  is away more than 25 days a month, my week-ends tend to be boring. The few friends that I have (they're the real ones... I have no time and energy for fake friends whom I don't really care about) all have boyfriends or girlfriends, kids, houses to take care of, etc. So I spend most of my week-ends alone, entertaining myself. Which isn't so bad sometimes.  But today I was home alone all day, doing nothing but watching a TV series I've seen about 25 times already and chatting a bit with Dutchboy. So I went out and saw Harry Potter for a second time. I'm not going to review the movie here, because I already did yesterday. I'll just say that I don't ever get tired of hearing Snape say  "Mister Potter"  in that precious accent...  Despite the good movie, I can say that this was a very boring Sunday.  I'm not complaining or anything. It's just that now that I'm not so busy with school anymore (having graduated), I just feel a bit more lonely at times and, after several years of being separated from my boyfriend, I wish things would change.  Oh well... Gotta be patient.

      First one I'm getting of all week. Since last week-end, at least.  It's nice, but also a bit depressing. I'm not used to being completely alone like this.  Went to yoga this morning. Enjoyed it so much (I really needed it after the crazy week I just had), I would have been able to keep doing it for the whole day. Accomplished quite a couple of things, but if you want to read about it, you have to go  urlLink here .  Came home, watched  Monster . I didn't like it. It was too hard for me, and I didn't think Charlize Theron's acting was good... I thought it was terribly caricatural and definitely too much. And Christina Ricci was almost as scary. But then again, I'm having a lot of trouble with violent movies lately. I used to not really care. Movies are movies anyways. But I've noticed that for a while now, I've been looking away or closing my eyes or even turning off the TV when I saw things I couldn't stand. It's just that it's so much everywhere now. In movies, on the news (images and soundbits of decapitations and stuff), in newspapers and magazines (like Time)... It's more than I can bear. I know violence exists, but I don't need it put under my nose all the time. It's starting to make me sick.  Anyways, after watching the movie, I went to sit outside to read, but I soon came back inside because 1) there was this kid's birthday party in the yard just behind mine and they wouldn't keep screaming (I mean, for like 10 minutes, a man kept going "Quiet! Quiet!" and I wanted to scream "Yeah! QUIET!!!!") and 2) although the sun was bright, the wind was cold and I was shivering. Came back inside and read my cool  urlLink Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)  book. I'm almost finished with it now. Then I have about 23 other books I want to read!  Chatted a bit with Dutchboy, watched  urlLink White Oleander  (I  think  I had seen it before because some bits seemed to remind me of something, but I'm not sure) and now I'm here, writing this. I'll soon be going to bed to read some more and then sleep.  So good night all!

      What a week!  It was absolutely crazy at work, and very educational.   I'm am replacing the PR lady for the 4 weeks she'll be gone on vacation, starting on Monday, and there was  a lot  to do before she left today.   I got into the office at 8 a.m., and left at 6 p.m., with no lunch break (or well, there was a lunch, but it was business.  I will be working a bit on Sunday night because we will have, in Montreal, referendums on city demergers, and at the end of the night, when the results are known, I have to send the press release to all the medias and important people. And throughout the week-end, I have to check my work voice mail for any interview requests with the president, and arrange that with him.   So I'm pretty much on stand-by all week-end. But I don't mind. I'm learning so much and I love my job, I love the people I work with, so I'm not complaining. I'm just a bit tired. Haha!  Consequence of all that, though, is that I missed yoga tonight. Class was a 7 p.m. I could have made it a bit late (I would have had to stop home to change and get my mat), but after such a crazy week, I didn't feel like rushing. So I'll come tomorrow morning instead.   For tonight, I rented 4 movies. Yes,    4   . Rented  urlLink Monster , which I can keep until Sunday, and - since I am in an Alan Rickman mood lately -, I also rented  urlLink Sense & Sensibility , which I had been wanting to see (again) for a while. But since there's this special at the video store, which allows you to rent 3 old movies for 7 days for only $4, I had to get two more movies, of course. So I rented  urlLink White Oleander , which I've never seen, and  urlLink Le battement d'ailes du papillon , a French movie with Audrey Tautou (you might know her from  urlLink Amélie from Montmartre ). On top of that, there is this book that has been keeping me up at night because it's so good that I want to finish. Add to that a bit of yoga and washing my car and my program's complete for the week-end.   Dutchboy decided it was time to  urlLink quit blogging . That's too bad. Like you all, I also enjoyed his blog. But it's also good news for me, kind of: that means I'll receive e-mails from him more often, and that these will be more personalized (as opposed to his blog which was for everyone) and of course a girl always likes such things from her guy. However, I will miss his blog, although I respect his decision. So bye bye Dutchblog!

       urlLink Michael's comment  to my latest blog entry makes me want to write about creativity tonight (since there's nothing else than work and yoga in my life at the moment, anyways).  First of all, I'd like Michael to be sure that I am not attacking his opinion in any way. It just inspired me for my entry of the day and I thought it'd be good to express why I don't agree with the following statement, especially since creativity is the exact reason why I wasn't attracted to the other job that was offered to me last week:    "There has to be more of a creative escape for me. I'm not sure how much creativity goes into what you ladies are doing, but I would certainly be drawing in the margins of my press release!"   To me, communication (my field of expertise) is all about creativity. I consider myself an artist much more than an intellectual, and that's why I refused the other job that was offered to me last week. The new job would have involved a lot of thinking and talking and researching and studying government programs. Very rational, very straightforward. But no creation. Just analysis. And I need the creativity, that's the one thing I need the most.  Writing a letter or a press release may sound boring to some people. But it is anything but easy, and it's all about creativity. You see, a lot of the people who have to write press releases have really boring stuff to report in those releases. Someone who works for a company that makes screwdriver has nothing really exciting to write about, not even with the company comes up with a new electrical screwdriver that can also be a hammer. But the person who has to write the press release to announce the launch of this new electrical screwdriver/hammer, if creative,  can  actually make an event out of it. It's all about picking the right words, putting them in the right order and arranging sentences in a way that is sure to make the reader want to find out more. And  that  takes a lot of creativity. Not a lot of people can do it.  When a journalist calls me requesting information for a report they're doing, and that the next morning I read two or three lines of this journalist's article in one of the main newspapers in Montreal that were actually written by me because taken from my press release, I feel like I've created something. I've contributed to informing the population about a given subject.   When I am given raw information, arrange it to make it attractive, with the right words, and work along with our graphic artist to put it into shape to create something like this:   urlLink       I think I can safely say my work involves a great amount of creativity.   Producing such documents is what I do all day long. I am an artist of words, an artist of the content, much more than an artist of the container. I don't paint, I don't draw, I don't build websites. However, I write the texts for a flier, I come up with the concept, I explain my idea to the graphic artist who realizes it for me. I call the supplier, pick the kind of paper I want, with the kind of finish I want, and the finished product is my vision come true (or sometimes not).   I wrote everything that is found of  urlLink this website , I coordonated everything so that the website was the way I wanted it to be. The webmaster's only job was to tell me what could realistically be done and what couldn't be done, give me his opinion, but I had the final word (this website is not perfect though because of several limitations, but I'm proud of it because it's my first professional website).  There is a very false belief that the only things that involve creation are singing, painting, drawing, etc. Writing is an art too. Let's not forget that 1/3 of the people on this planet can't write or read (if not more). And, of the people who can, no many can actually do it right. I honestly don't know a lot of people who can write correctly. Not well. Just correctly. Without making mistakes. Even in the communications field, these people are rare. To be able to actually make things interesting and exciting to read, I think you really do have to be an artist. The art in writing is not only about writing novels. It's in every piece of paper, every leaflet someone gives you on the street and that you so hastily throw on the sidewalk. Sometimes the art sucks, but it's there.  Of course, when I was a kid, I wanted to be an artist. I wanted to be the next Madonna. I wanted to dance like her, I wanted to sing like her (which I think I actually do because I can't sing! haha!), I wanted to be as brilliant as she is (because she is one of the women I admire the most in the modern world, still to this day). But then I realized that this was a kid's dream and that this was never gonna happen. But I also found out I had other talents, I could create other things. I had a talent with words. I had a talent with languages. And with these two talents, I could create texts that delighted, or interested, or impressed the people who read them.  Every morning, when I come in to work, I sit down and create something. All the time. That's what I do all day. You just have to look well to realize that everything you do actually involves creation.  And with this, I'm going to end my rant... that is for those of you who didn't fall asleep reading this oh so interesting blog entry!

      I've never been so busy at work as lately. The June 20th referendum on city demergers being my big file, I am getting tons of interview requests and preparing for the big day on Sunday: writing the press release, checking who'll be available for the interviews, working on a flier we'll distribute in a day or two... on top of the ton of other work, non-related to the demergers but as important.   So, work. That's what my life is like lately. There'll be a love-in in Westmount on Saturday afternoon: people in favor of the new megacity (which is our position) will gather there, in a borough that strongly wants to demerger, and just tell them that we love them and that we want them to stay united with Montreal. Pretty much like the love-in anglos did for Quebec at the time of the referendum in 1995. I might have to go, to accompany the president. Should be interesting. And on Sunday night, I will have to send off the resume to the newswire and to the medias as soon as the referendum results are known. So looks like I'll pretty much be working both days this week-end, though not all day.  BUT it's fun, and interesting, and I'm learning so much. I can't complain. I really can't. Less than 6 months ago, I would never have thought such a thrilling job would be happening for me. I am really loving it and appreciating it.   I mean, 6 months ago, I was making photocopies, sending faxes, sending off packages and scanning pictures of my boss' kids. I was my boss' slave, pretty much. Doing all the stuff she didn't want to do. Now, I know I am appreciated (I ever got offered another job within the organization, that I declined because although it would have paid more and would have been permanent, it wasn't for me), I work closely with the communications director and the communications VP, I get to talk to very important business people in other organizations every week, I have a daily contact with journalists, I write press releases, answer interview requests, write letters to artists who win prizes or to big company CEOs who make acquisitions to congratulate them (those letters are not signed by me, but they're written by me)... I could go on and on but I mean,  this  is the real thing. This is what I studied for. And I'm totally loving it. I never expected that I would find the perfect job for me in a political and economical world but hey, life's full of surprises. Lately, I breathe, eat and sleep politics (by default, because it's my main dossier), and I'm absolutely loving it!  But to calm me down (as you can tell, I'm on a high), I went to yoga tonight. Really enjoyed it. But that's for another blog...

      Tonight was the Chiefs debate between Paul Martin, Stephen Harper, Jack Layton and Gilles Duceppe in French language in the federal elections campaign.  Interesting debate, maybe not for the reasons you'd think at first. Yeah, those were two boring hours most of the time, because they kept bringing up arguments we already know by heart. But I'm glad I watched, if only to confirm that I will never be able to support the Conservative Party (can't support their war, abortion, gay marriage and bilinguism position. Ever.) and to make me discover a party that I didn't know well: the New Democrats.   First of all, I can't understand much of what Jack Layton says when he speaks French, but I love his accent!! But of course, I'm not stupid enough as to vote for a party because of its leader's accent! But I was glad to discover that the NDP's program is much like the ADQ's program, the ADQ being the party I support on the provincial level.  Until today, I had no idea who I was going to vote for. There is only publicity in my county for the Bloc Québécois (which I refuse to support because I'm not separatist) and the Liberal Party (which I refuse to support anymore because of the sponsorships scandal). But I found out that we also have other candidates (of course you have to go through all the parties' websites to find out, they won't put all this info on one website -- why would they make it so easy for you?!), namely for the Green Party, and the NDP. I was gonna vote for the Green Party, but the NDP might have a program that is closer to reality, while still being in the family/social economy/ecology/quality of life/respect of human rights line. So now I printed both programs and will go through them to figure out who I'm gonna vote for.  I know for certain that neither candidate I vote for will be elected. It'll be liberal or bloc in my county. Probably liberal. But at least I'll give my support to something I believe in.  I'll be curious to see the English debate tomorrow night...   ***  On a totally different note,   Co  urteney   Co  x and David Arquette had a little girl yesterday, named Coco. Took me a minute to realize it (probably) is because of the mother's name, but I find it kinda cute (I know other people will hate it!). Kinda has a nice cachet... Like Coco Chanel...  I don't know those guys (although I feel like I do because I know all of the  Friends  episodes by heart), but after trying so hard for so long and having lost more than one baby before, I can only be happy for them.

      Once again last night, I dreamt of Cooper.  It happens at least twice a week. Very vivid dreams, as if he were still alive. I can still smell that spot on the top of his head that almost smelled like a baby's head, I can still remember the softness of the tip of his ears... Every time, I wake up in shock realizing that he isn't with us anymore.  It's been almost 3 1/2 months since we put him to sleep and I still can't believe we did that. I miss him so much.  Lots of rain this morning. Feels like November. That's really not helping.

      All in all, this was a pretty quiet week-end... even boring.  My sister moved out to her first apartment with her boyfriend last Monday, and my parents leave every week-end of the summer on a camping trip, so I was completely alone all week-end and that pretty much sucked. Talked to no one, except the few times Dutchboy had time to call me from the festival. Pretty long week-end, pretty depressing too. Hell, I wouldn't want to be single and living on my own because I week-end like that every week-end must be horrible.   On top of this, my parents didn't even bother calling to tell me they were not coming home for dinner, so I waited for them for nothing. I think it's a total lack of respect. I mean, I always make a point of calling them if I don't come home because I know they'd worry otherwise. Why can't they do the same for me?   Oh well, I had time to read in the sun a lot, and I really enjoyed that. The Clan of the Cave Bear is turning out to be an excellent book, there are 5 more after this one, and I also have a bunch of other books I've been wanting to read for a while. That's the thing I'm enjoying the most about having finished school, I think: being able to read as much as when I was going to school, but this time only for fun.

      Michael posted more about abortion and guns on his website and, as a woman, I violentely reacted to some of his comments on abortion. My reaction was too long to post on his blog, so I'm doing it here:   I actually get that a lot when I'm discussing this with friends who support abortion. Lest we forget adoption? I mean, rape isn't a compelling enough reason to end the life of the unborn child in my personal opinion, but to some it might be.   Believe me, as a woman, I can only imagine how I'd feel becoming pregnant after a rape and I think I would rather kill myself than having to carry a baby that would remind me for 9 months of the horror in which it was conceived.   And as a woman, the possibility of carrying a baby and giving it away for adoption is another thing I couldn't do. Think of that baby when it grows up, wanting to find his/her mother and, when they do, discovering how they were conceived and how they'd feel. I can only imagine what it would be like and I wouldn't want to impose that on anybody.   I don't think that we must preserve life at any price. A month-old foetus is, in my opinion, much less valuable than the sanity of the carrying mother.    If someone is willing to do this, she should be tried in court for attempting suicide and murder, and thrown into a mental institution.   Guess you have to have a uterus to start imagining the despair of a woman who'd be in that position. Don't be so quick to judge, those cases are most frequent than we think. Letting a woman live with a baby conceived during a rape or incest equals in killing her soul, in my opinion. Is it less important than saving the life of an unwanted baby, who would have no quality of life?   People try to kill themselves all the time, does that mean we should legalize suicide by help of a doctor? As you've stated, people aren't always in the right mind to put themselves in that position, and keeping abortion just so these idiots don't hurt themselves doesn't seem like the best answer to the problem. And if this is a reason for legalizing abortion, then why should people not legalize suicide, and murders. People TRY to kill other people all the time, but I don't think having an institution that kills people more effectively is the key here.   I don't think abortion equals killing people. Yeah, at a certain age, the foetus becomes more of a person and I do think that someone who would murder a woman pregnant with a 7-month old baby should be charged with double murder (At what age to draw the line is another debate in itself.), but a 1 or 2-month old foetus is not a person. It's just a little bean in the uterus of a woman. Don't go thinking that even for a woman who doesn't want that little bean it's not difficult to get rid of it. But it's not a person yet, with a personality, emotions, feelings and consciousness.    And yes, I do think in some cases we should legalize assisted suicide. Hell, we put our dogs and cats to sleep when they suffer too much, but we can't even do that with the people we love?!?! Does that make any sense?! Of course, we should help people who try to kill themselves because they're depressed or something, not give them the rope to go hang themselves. But yes, I do think that assisted suicide should be legal in some cases, with the judgement of the court. And I do think that sympathy murders shouldn't be so hardly punished. We've had many cases of people, in the past years, helping their loved ones to die because they suffered too much. These people consciously put their life aside by doing something they knew was illegal for someone they loved so much they couldn't bare to see suffer. These people did the most difficult thing in the world, which is to kill someone you love because they wanted to do what was best for that person, not for themselves. They had to do it themselves, with their own hands, because no one would do it for them. Imagine how traumatizing that must be. Imagine how much you must love someone to do that for them.   That's a great proof of humanity, I think. Because what distinguishes humans from animals? It's the feelings, the emotions. When there is none of this left, just an empty shell, the form of a body with no more soul it in, Man becomes just another suffering animal. It's not human anymore. We put our pets to sleep when they become too old. Why couldn't we do it for the people we love the most when they have no quality of life at all, when we know it'll never come back? Don't we always say that quality's better than quantity?   Doctors won't let a young woman abort unless she has good reasons. Don't believe that they go do it without question. It's too serious. If they agree to do it, it's because it's the right thing to do.   Same thing with assisted suicide. In the countries where it's allowed, they don't just help anyone who wants to die do it. They only do it when there is nothing else to do. Institutions are not killing people. They're helping people live better, even into death, which is the only certainty of life.   I think my strong positioning on abortion stems mostly from the fact that my mom had me when she was 16 years old.   Your mother and your dad were very young when they had you and they took their responsibilities and made sure you had everything you needed. All my respect goes to them for that, that's the best thing they could do.   Unfortunately, not everyone has the psychologic or material means to do that. How many kids in America have mothers who can hardly provide them with food and clothes and who don't care for them? How many of them don't even have a father?    You know, despite the fact that I was an accident, she wanted me. And I'm glad she did, because had I the ability to speak up way back when in the womb, I would've said "I choose LIFE!!"    Problem is that lots of women do not want the babies they're having. That makes for unhappy, unwanted children. I'm not sure those children who have said "I choose LIFE!!" too if given a chance, knowing how their life would be.  And the truth is, we do not have the ability to speak up in the womb. We do not even have the ability to think. That's something we learn as we come out into the world.   This isn't an issue between a woman and her baby, it's an issue dealing with humans in general.   I don't agree with that. I'm not "humans in general". I'm a woman. And all I can do is make decisions for myself and think about how I would feel in such and such situation. I don't live for humankind. I live only for myself. I do what I believe in, I live my life in the way I think I should live it. My body belongs only to me. And nothing could force me to bring an unwanted baby into this world. Ever. It's very selfish, but my body is the only thing I will own for my entire life and I only have control over it.   So I feel a man has just as much of a right to say what happens.   If the woman is in a couple, yes. But then again, ultimately, it's the woman's choice. The man can storm and leave, but the woman will do only what she wants to do. That's our power, that's our right and no man can take that away from us.  And now this rant is way too long to get into the whole guns issue, and that's a less interesting one anyways... Again, I'll just say that I know a lot of people who own guns know how to use them. Unfortunately, a lot more don't and those are the dangerous ones. Hunting guns are one thing. They're made to hunt and, if needed, you can protect yourself with them. But pistols and other kinds of firearms are made exactly in the purpose of killing human beings (I have yet to see someone hunting with a pistol) and there is no reason that these weapons should be available outside of the army.

      I just wanted to share the fact that I was at a pub tonight, and managed to walk into the men's room while a man was there, doing what he had to do.  I am proud to say that I am not even embarrassed by this and even thought this mistake of mine was funny as hell!  I'm getting much better... not so long ago, I would have been mortified.   But what's the point? I made a mistake, apologized, laughed with the guy, laughed alone while peeing in the ladies room and laughed again with my colleagues back at the table.  Fun was had by all, so why feel bad about it?!

       Warning: Please let's have an  intelligent  and  civil  conversation about this. No  "The Lord says it's wrong..."  because that isn't intelligent, that's emotional. And no  "You suck because..."  because that's not civil. Any disrespectful comments and any reference to god will be deleted. Even this entire post will be, if needed.   Michael posted some comments to my latest post, to which I started writing a reply, in the comments section. But since it's getting pretty long and it's my opinion and my blog anyways, I thought it'd make for good discussion.  So here,  urlLink Michael said :  I'm all for the gay marriage, not for the abortion, and I have nothing against inanimate objects. (Guns.) Just people.   Alright, I respect your opinion. But let me ask:   About abortion - What do you do with a girl who's been raped and became pregnant as a result of that rape?   Would you rather have a woman use a clothes hanger or knitting needles to reach inside her own body and kill her baby? Because that's what women used to do before abortion was legal. And they died from that.  There will always be women who won't want the baby they're pregnant with. They won't even want to bear it. Should we allow them to hurt themselves?  Or should we allow that doctors who decide to help those women have to wear bulletproof vests while mowing their lawn, as was the case before because people actually thought these doctors should die?  There will always be pregnant women who will abort. Legally or not. Why not at least give them the help or the support to do it without becoming a hazard for themselves and help them get through it? We can either pretend we don't know what's going on, pretend we don't see them or hear them, or we can help them. Do we really have a choice?  Now guns - You have nothing against inanimate objects, just people. Once again, I agree with you there.   The problem is that people, in general, are stupid. Man (with a capital M) has a great potential for intelligence. However, man (with a small m) rarely uses it.   Come on, we have to write on plastic bags  "Do not swallow."  because some people were actually stupid enough to swallow plastic bags in the past (why would you wanna do that?).   Should we write  "Do not shoot."  on a shotgun? Of course not, that's what they're made for in the first place. Guns are dangerous in the hands of the wrong people. But how do you know who the "wrong people" are? The wrong people are everybody. Everybody makes bad judgements. It happens. Because we only use an infinitely small part of our huge brains.   The average age of a crowd is 7 years old. In communications, we always write as if we were writing for children. Because even if it's obvious, if you don't specify it, people are going to understand wrong and ask questions.   The sad truth is :  We are stupid.  We are. And we have the sad tendency to destroy our own kind. We are not to be trusted with weapons. We don't even need weapons! Really, what are the odds that a robber actually comes into your house at night, you wake up, you pull the gun from under your pillow and shoot the bastard? It won't happen like that. You'll get into a fight, drop the gun, someone will get hurt and it may not be the bad guy.   The only people who should be trusted with weapons are army people. Yes, the army is important, but not to the point that we should invest in weapons rather than health. Yes, we have to protect our country. But when was the last time we really had to protect our country? Over 100 years ago. We've fought foreign wars since, but never here. The only country that could really take over Canada would be the United-States. And then, what good will it do us that you would have enough weapons to protect us if you're the ones attacking us? And again, will it be Mr. John Doe from Washington who sleeps with a pistol under his pillow who'll come to our rescue? I think not.  Weapons in the hands of the wrong people are dangerous. And fact of the matter is, almost everyone on this planet is "the wrong people" when it comes to handling guns.

      In a week from now, Canadians will have to do their duty: they'll have to go elect the next four years' government.  I've long wondered who I was going to vote for. Here in Quebec, the main parties are the  urlLink Liberal Party , and the  urlLink Bloc Québécois . I've always voted liberal, because I'm not a separatist. Only, this time, there's the whole sponsorship scandal that has been ruining it. I refuse to vote for such a corrupt party.  But then again, all governments are corrupted, to some point. And voting for any other party than the liberals would almost equal giving a vote to the  urlLink Conservative Party , that is pretty dominant in the West of the country. Voting for anything else than the liberals would equal allowing the Conservative Party to win.   Allowing the Conservative Party to win would mean electing a government that is against women's right to abortion. It would mean electing a government that is against gay marriage. It would mean electing a government that would spend billions on army equipments while the last thing we need is yet more guns. It would mean electing a government that is against official bilinguism of the country. It would mean electing a government that would undo right that we have so hardly acquired through the years. It would mean electing that is as retrograde as the Bush government.   I am not going to let that happen. I believe in the right of a woman to abort if she feels she can't have the baby she's pregnant with. I believe in everyone's right to get married - hetero, gay or lesbian. I believe in a weapon-free world. And I have the right to speak French and be served in French by a national company such as Air Canada.   Stephen Harper scares me. I am proud of my government for standing up to Bush last year and deciding not to go to war against Irak. If Harper had been Prime minister at the time, we'd have to answer the same questions as the Bush government now that those mass destruction weapons are nowhere to be found.   I want to keep living the way I do, in one of the most avant-gardiste countries of the world.   I agree, the Liberal government invested a lot of money in suspicious programs. And that's wrong. But that's just money. I'm not saying I'm forgiving them for it. Au contraire, I hold it against them. But I prefer having some of my money invested in the wrong places for the wrong reasons, than to have my rights violated.  On June 28th, I'm going to vote Liberal. Because it's the lesser of two evils.  (Do you think I'd be good in politics?! Haha!)

      I'm a cheater. I cheated.   Ever since I started working for  urlLink Clarins Paris  in August 2002 (I quit there to work for the Board of Trade in last January and that was the best decision I ever made, but that's another story), I have been using Clarins products, which are very high quality. It was easy, since I could get them for much cheaper and sometimes for free.   But now I don't work for Clarins anymore and I'm starting to run out of some products. I can still order Clarins products for cheaper than they are in stores, through friends that I made that still work at Clarins, but it makes me feel bad for using them for that.   So this week I cheated: I went out and bought some  urlLink Biotherm  products. Because they're much cheaper than Clarins, but they're also very cool products, much fresher, much younger (as in the concept) and more attractive to me. I even became a  real customer , by choosing to buy my products in the store that had the gift with purchase! And in that gift with purchase (a cosmetics pouch with a couple of product samples), there was a sample of Source Thérapie, which I just tried on.       OH. MY. GOD.  I think I'll become even more of a customer and go buy it. The Source Thérapie promise:    Pure SPA Concentrate Skin Perfector   A spa-blue, silky gel texture for an incredibly soft and velvety-smooth skin. Source Therapie is a skin perfector which acts on the skin in 2 stages:  - an instant perfecting effect. After 5 seconds, skin is incredibly soft and the complexion more even.  - a long-lasting perfecting effect. After 5 days, skin is perfected, ideally moisturized, soothed and glowing with health.     And hell, it  does  feel like you're applying silk on your face! Of course, the sample is too small to see if the 5-day promise comes true. And so you have to buy the product to see. I'm seriously considering it.  Just thought I'd share my discovery with the shopaholics out there (I'm sure there are some!). And too bad for Clarins. They're too expensive and too high class. Biotherm suits me better, 'cause I'm young and cool.

      I think the definition changes for everyone, every day.  Today, happiness for me is:  - Introducing two teenagers (15 and 16 years old) on a short internship at the Board of Trade to my world of communications. Sharing with them my passion with this crazy world, showing them how to prepare for an interview, watching them interviewing one of the funniest people in the company, and reading their beautiful and naive piece on him afterwards. Seeing them leave at the end of the day with a big smile on their face because they had fun.  - Discovering my  urlLink yoga's studio new and improved website  and offering them my help to correct some of the small spelling mistakes they didn't detect after reading their texts over and over. Just because that's what I'm good at, I like it and I like to do it for them.  - Knowing that my boyfriend will be with me in less than 24 hours and actually enjoying that part of missing him because you know it won't last so long anymore.  - Having a  urlLink Frozen Hot Chocolate  with tons of whipped cream just because it's good.      - Leaving work 1 hour later than usual still in a good mood because  1- I got my new contract, 2- I got a lot done today, and 3- I worked overtime but I don't mind because I love it.  - Listening to the same Whitesnake song I've been stuck on for a week over and over again, singing really loudly in my car.  - Going to yoga, deciding to put my mat at the side of the room that is completely opposite to the door and not having the slightest feeling of anxiety (I tend to get very claustrophobic if there are too many things between me and the door).  - Coming home with this great feeling of being happy and having nothing to complain about.  Because happiness can be that simple...

      Just now, I was watching the news and a terrible news literally made me cry:  A 20-year old man was arrested in Saguenay yesterday for sexually aggressing a 7-year old little girl. The guy was drunk, in the middle of the day, came in this field where 5 friends were playing together, approached the little girl, put his pants down and hers as well... The little friends tried to help the girl, but of course they were too small. The jerk decided to just lift the little girl in his arms and go further away. The friends got the help of someone in a car who had stopped, seeing there was a problem. They called the police, who found the guy in action, abusing the poor little girl.  SEVEN FUCKING YEARS OLD! How is that little girl supposed to spend the rest of her life, now? And what sentence do you think this monster will receive? A couple of years and then he'll be free? After having murdered a little girl in her soul... is that fair? Is that what we call justice?  Monsters like this only deserve to have their balls cut off... And even then. That would be too nice.  This story makes me sick, and it really makes me cry. Imagine the pain of that happening to yourself. Imagine the pain of that happening to your little girl. Imagine the feelings of anger and hate arising. How the fuck are you supposed to deal with that?!   It's too horrible...

      Yesterday, a bunch of people from work were supposed to go have lunch to celebrate my boss' birthday, which was this week-end. Something came up, and we had to postpone until today.  This morning, my colleague and I spent like an hour trying to reach the restaurant we wanted to go to by phone to make a reservation. No answer. We decided we'd just show up and see. Turns out, the whole block had a power failure and they couldn't receive customers.  So we decided to walk to another restaurant. On the way there, we were just having fun, mainly telling stories about times that we tripped and fell and looked crazy (this all started when one of us tripped). We got the a street corner, and another of us fell. Not just fell... She fell  big time . We were in the Old Montreal, where streets are uneven... She just stepped down the sidewalk to cross the street, and she fell flat on her face. She didn't even have time to stop herself with her arms. Her arms stayed on both sides of her body. So the nose and the cheeks took the impact. She got up and her nose was  pissing blood . Not from her nostrils, but the skin on the nose was cut, and it was cut deep.   We didn't have a lot of tissues and she really was bleeding bad... We found a cab and put her and my boss in there... I told my boss where I knew there was a medical clinic nearby and they just left.  I have to say I was amazingly surprised at the reaction of the people around. Guys in a car stopped and put their hazard lights on and gave us a whole box of tissues for our poor friend. Another guy in a suit came out of nowhere with a bottle full of water to wash off the blood. Another one was standing there, offering us to call an ambulance. In the panick of the moment, we didn't have time to thank all of them properly. I know they won't read this, but  thank you .   I was really amazing that in a big city like Montreal, more than 3 people on a street corner cared enough about another human being to get out of their ways and offer their help. Same thing with the cab driver, who wouldn't take any money for the ride...   In 1997, I had a pretty bad car accident. Tons of people witnessed it, but it took 10 minutes before someone actually stopped to help me. And I know that those things happen a lot: people watch, but they don't help, for whatever reason. Today, I was really happy to see how these people offering their help... Really, it was unexpected (as much as the accident!) and it just makes me happy that there are still people who have time to do something good in this world...  Our colleague bled a lot, but her nose isn't broken... She'll probably feel all the pain more tomorrow, when the adrenaline is gone and the headache kicks in, but she was lucky in her badluck... Needless to say, we didn't have much lunch as we were not hungry, but we're very happy to know that she'll be ok and doesn't even need stitches.  If you ever see someone in trouble on the street, stop and offer your help. It'll make you feel good and it'll make them feel better.

      This would be more appropriate for my  urlLink Lotus Garden , and I did post about it there, but I thought this was good enough to post here as well.  If you still doubt the amazing effects of yoga, check out this article:  urlLink Paraplegic becomes an unlikely expert on yoga . This guy not only managed to find back some sensation in his supposedely paralyzed legs, but he found the strength of mind (and, of course, body) to become a teacher and deeply touch his students with his comprehension of yoga. He even founded  urlLink Mind Body Solutions , to reach even more people with yoga, in their workplace, for instance.  That's really something to look up to. Very Rick Allen-ish, for you Def Leppard fans. The guy is paralyzed from the waist down, and not only does he manage to learn yoga, he also teaches it!   Very inspiring...

      Don't seem so shock, I do not mean in any way that Americans are generally bad. I just thought this was a good title for a post and that it would attract attention. You know it does.  What Americans am I talking about?  urlLink American Apparel . Believe it or not, I found out about that clothes company only two weeks ago. Or well, I guess I had heard the name, but never really cared for what they did.   Two weeks ago, my shopaholic colleague Elizabeth introduced them to me, and told me how their yoga pants were cool. Since I'll be starting to practice yoga twice as more (4 classes a week) in July, I thought I needed another outfit. So I thought why not order from American Apparel?  I mean, yeah, it's made in America (as opposed to the clothes I bought before which were made in Canada, and I tend to support the Canadian economy as much as I can), but it's also twice cheaper, they have a great philosophy, they seem to be great corporate citizens, and they recognize Canadian dollars at par, meaning that for them, $1 CDN = $1 US. So if I order pants that are $35 US on the website, they cost me just $35 CDN since I'm in Canada. Pretty cool. I wish  urlLink Victoria's Secret  did that.   So I ordered the  urlLink yoga pants  (in black, of course), and this  urlLink bra-cami, with hidden bralette  for support (not that I have big boobs, but you  do  need support and doing yoga with a bra is not fun and not comfortable).   I received both items less than one week after ordering. Cool. Try them on. They fit perfectly. Very nice. But there's a whole in the yoga pant: the left leg wasn't sown properly. Damn it. I was so looking forward to wearing my new clothes! The cotton feels so good against my skin! But I have to exchange the pants.  Problem is, American Apparel don't have an exchange policy, only a return one. If you want to get another pair of pants, looks like you have to order it again. But then I think, why should I pay for the shipping (they charge you according to the value of the clothes you order, not their weight, so it's expensive for what it is) 3 times (first time, shipping back, then new pants) for a quality control mistake? I'm a bit upset, so I e-mail the company about it.  Well they dealt with me personally, very quickly, the person from L.A. (where the company is based) transferring me rapidly to the person who can help me in Canada (where my clothes were shipped from). This morning I get a phone call from this lady in Canada,  en français s'il vous plait , telling me to just send the pants back, they'll ship me new ones and credit me the shipping. How great is that?!   So the pants I received had a defect, but the company dealt with it, with a great personalized service, and quickly. Doesn't happen too often. Most companies don't have time to help you and be nice about it. I will definitely order from them again. That's what I mean when I say they're good Americans.

      I had great plans for the week-end.  Ok, maybe not so great, but I rented two movies to watch, I had tons of last season's Sopranos episodes to watch, I had a book to finish ( urlLink Blood Canticle: the Vampire Chronicles ) and another one to begin ( urlLink The Valley of Horses ), I wanted to do some yoga...  Well, I didn't do as much yoga as I had planned, I still have one movie to watch, I didn't watch all of the Sopranos episodes (that's the kind of series that when I have the possibility to get to the end as quickly as I can, I just can't wait), I didn't finish my Lestat book yet, and it's 13.35 on Sunday afternoon already. Might as well say the week-end is over.  Or maybe not, but almost! I hate when that happens! What did I do with my time? I didn't even watch TV that much... but hell, what happened? Ok, so I cooked a little, which is a miracle in itself. And I cleaned up after my mess (not a miracle, but when you cook it takes longer... and since I don't cook often, I don't always think about that)... And I did read quite a lot. But I love this book so much, I want to know how it ends! And I loved the one previous to  The Valley of Horses , so I want to read the next one as soon as possible! See how much I suffer?!  Haha... I'm having such a nice problem since I graduated: for the first time since high school, some 8 years ago (wow, I am beginning to feel old sometimes... saw the high school graduation picture of a girl I use to babysit when she was like 9 in the paper yesterday!), I can actually read for fun. And I have so many books I want to read that I'm going crazy because I can't get to them fast enough. How's that? I'd say that's a very nice problem.  So I'll go back to Lestat now... The more I read about him, the more I think that Tom Cruise really was the perfect Lestat in  urlLink Interview with the Vampire . So beautiful, so romantic, so distinguished, so attractive. Can't help but get back to this feeling I had 10 years ago when I read the first Vampire Chronicles books and wanted to be a vampire, every time I read a new Anne Rice book. Anne Rice is such an amazing author. Her descriptions, the romantism and the sensuality in her books are just unbelievable. I wish Lestat would come and make me a vampire now!

      What a crazy week!  My colleague who had that accident Tuesday of last week didn't come back yet. She's been having infection on her nose (where she hurt herself), she has to go to the doctor every day to get the wound cleaned and everything, and she's beginning her summer vacations (4 weeks) on Monday... So basically she's having extended vacations (although I'm sure she mustn't enjoy them as much as she should have!).   As I was the one scheduled to do her work during her vacations, I've started doing it last week, already. And of course it wasn't planned that way, I didn't have the occasion to sit down with her and go over everything that had to be done and the way in which it should be done. So I learned by myself. It's been a bit tiring, a lot stressful, but also extremely interesting.  But I'm glad it's the week-end now. Just came back from yoga class. I have another one tomorrow morning, and tomorrow night I'm going to the  urlLink Montreal Jazz Festival  with a friend. Anybody who's been in Montreal during the Jazz Festival and who likes good music knows how much fun this is (a lot!). The weather should be great, so it'll just be awesome to walk on the street, from one stage to the other, listen and watch great musicians playing jazz or blues music, and dance around. Because that's what people do at the Jazz Fest: the streets are closed and people dance in the middle of the street. That's real summer for Montrealers, that's a real good time.  I just love my city. I really do think it is the most culturally alive city in North America. Some might say that it's New York, with Broadway and everything. But I don't agree. In Montreal, every summer, we have the biggest Jazz Festival in the world. We also have  urlLink Les FrancoFolies de Montréal , a festival celebrating French music from around the world. We also have the  urlLink Just for Laughs Festival , where some great comedians, Canadian and American, where discovered. And that's without talking about the  urlLink Festival International des Nuits d'Afriques , the  urlLink Montreal World Film Festival  and a ton of other ones. Unfortunately, as residents of Montreal, we tend to take those events for granted and too often forget to participate in them. But they really are (part of) what truly makes Montreal the greatest city to live in the summer, and I love my city and the people who make it what it is. And so tomorrow I'll go and enjoy life in what, in my opinion, is the greatest city in North America.   urlLink Ibrahim Ferrer  (from the  urlLink Buena Vista Social Club ) was in town this week, for the Jazz Fest, and I wasn't able to get tickets for his concert. It was completely sold out. This makes me so sad. I absolutely love him, and he is definitely my favorite member of the Buena Vista... He plays regularly at the Jazz Fest, but with him being 77 years old, there is no way of knowing if he'll ever be back here... I hope he will. I so would love to see him.   urlLink

       urlLink Dutchboy  was here for the week-end and so I was in my bubble, on my cloud for the past few days. Not much Internet for me then, there are more important things.  But he left this afternoon so I'm back. With not so many things to say tonight. The last two days have been extremely busy at work, and I've been spending the rest of my time with you-know-who. Until this afternoon, that is. Drove Dutchboy to the airport, came home, and went to yoga. Damn did that feel good. But that's for another blog.  The big news of the week-end, however, is (and I think I can mention it since DB doesn't have a blog anymore) that DB received his answer from Immigration Quebec and he was accepted! Now we have to go through Immigration Canada for the form of things, but that means that it's just a matter of time because what we've been working towards for several years finally happens! Words cannot express how I felt when I learned the news... Of course, it hasn't really sunk in yet and there'll be a lot to do so that he can move here, but the moment is getting closer and closer. Finally!

      I have something fun to mention, if not really interesting.  &nbsp;  After a very moving conversation my yoga teacher tonight, whom I now admire and respect more than ever (see the  urlLink Lotus Garden  for full story), I felt a bit teary and sappy... so I went to the video store and rented a girly movie:  urlLink Chasing Liberty . Then, I stopped by the ice cream parlour to get a chocolate milkshake.  And now I'll go sit down and watch the girly movie because I feel girly and emotional and good because there are good people in this world, despite everything else.

      I've been neglecting this blog a little bit lately, and I apologize.  &nbsp;  Or well, I wouldn't say I'm really neglecting it. It's just that my life revolves so much around yoga lately, especially with this little contract I got, that there isn't really much else going on. So I don't know what to write about in here.  &nbsp;  Those of you who still care to know what's going on in my life, I hope you're also reading my  urlLink Lotus Garden . I think there is actually a lot of interesting stuff happening, but it's at another level and well, I'm happy with that.  &nbsp; I mean, I've never been busier at work, with more responsabilities, and busier in my personal life, with keeping the discipline to practice yoga 4 times a week, and I've never been happier. Because it brings me so much.  &nbsp; Anyways, those of you who are interested in my spiritual evolution, you know where to follow it. For the others, sorry for the less frequent posts. As soon as something more exciting happens on beside what's going on on the mat, I'll let you know!

      It's another busy week. Even busier than usual. I got a little correction and writing contract with my yoga studio. They're launching 3 CDs soon, and so I have to review the booklets for those CDs, and I have to write their press release as well. It's a very cool project and I am extremely happy that I get the chance to be involved in it (just not sure I can talk about it yet, so I'm not giving out too many details), so I don't mind that it means that I work during my lunch breaks and at night as well. Or well, between regular work, my 4 weekly yoga classes and this little contract, I don't have a lot of time left.   But that's cool, 'cause it makes me really happy. The only bad side is that I am neglecting my blog a little bit. But hey, real life comes first!   Meanwhile, I've been able to take care of my passport request today, after postponing it for like 3 months. Unbelievable what a little laziness will do! My passport expired in April, I've been meaning to request a new one since, I filled the form many times but I was just too lazy to go out and get my stupid picture taken... while I perfectly knew there was a photo shop downstairs from work who made passport pictures! I mean, I walk by it every time I go get a coffee! Now  that  lazy. So today I took care of it because I started panicking that I have a vacation at the end of August and I might very well go on a holiday out of the country and well then I might just need my passport, eh?! I hate myself when I procrastinate like that. Really stupid. I mean, I left my office at 12.44 today to get my picture done, at 12.56 I was back upstairs with it! And it took me 3 months to decide to spend 12 minutes of my time to get that done.  Oh well... as long as I have my passport on time. Now if I could only find out where I'm going!

      Ok, so after my big rant about how great the city is and how we enjoy the festivals and everything, I didn't even go to the Jazz Fest! The weather was crap (raining on and off all day) and we didn't want to run the chance that it might rain again, so we went to see a movie instead (Harry Potter on IMAX screen... had to change a bit for my 4th time!). Then I went to my friend's place for the rest of the evening and we just talked and it was really nice.  All afternoon today, I've been glued to the TV, and that's all  urlLink Dutchboy 's fault. See, he's a huge X-Files fan. I like the X-Files, but I'm a wuss and that's not the kind of show that I want to watch when I'm all alone at home, at night. So I just watch it when Dutchboy's around, just so he can protect me in case. Last week-end, we watched a couple of episodes, and he told me, of the 5 seasons we have here, which ones I should watch while he's gone. So I started watching them today. Problem is, each and everyone of them ended with a  To be continued...  So of course, I always had to watch the following episode. It's 20.00 now and I just stopped watching TV! It's all his fault!

      Well, seems like my latest post had a lot of people reacting. Opinions seem to be very different...   I don't feel like getting into the whole debate tonight because I'm too tired of thinking and I just want to sit down and watch a bit of TV (it's been a busy busy, very PMSed week), but I'll just say that, in this case, I think what was said was very innocent and shared by a lot of people, inside the USA and out, it didn't harm anybody and the reaction was way over the top. By escorting out the singer, the management was basically telling the rioting crowd that it was ok to react that way when you don't agree with someone's opinion. Maybe it wasn't wise from that singer to make such a comment on stage. But being an entertainer, you can at least take those risks and then take all the blame if it turns ugly. Something you can't do when you're&nbsp;a PR person representing clients. Very different. When you're your own client, you have no one to report to but to you, and so you can do whatever you like. But she certainly didn't deserve to be escorted out. Especially in a country where people come to so they can have freedom. That's ridiculous.   Besides from that, though week physically. Been having horrible headaches and cramps and stuff... Ladies, you know what I mean. But  urlLink yoga class  really made me feel better tonight, and I just rented   urlLink The Human Stain  , the first DVD of   urlLink Six Feet Under Season 2   and...   urlLink Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights  !!! Guilty, girly pleasure. I can keep the DVDs all week-end, so I'm going to watch a little bit every day, between the yoga practices, the grocery and birthday present shopping and cleaning the house.

      From  urlLink Canoe.ca :     Tuesday, July 20, 2004    Linda Ronstadt jeered in Las Vegas  LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Linda Ronstadt not only got booed, she also got the boot after lauding filmmaker Michael Moore and his new movie, Fahrenheit 9/11, during a performance at the Aladdin hotel-casino.   Before singing Desperado for an encore Saturday night, the 58-year-old singer called Moore a "great American patriot" and "someone who is spreading the truth." She also encouraged everyone to see the documentary about President George W. Bush.   Ronstadt's comments drew loud boos, and some of the 4,500 people in attendance stormed out of the theatre. People also tore down concert posters and tossed cocktails into the air.   "It was a very ugly scene," Aladdin President Bill Timmins told The Associated Press. "She praised him and all of a sudden all bedlam broke loose."   Timmins, who is British and was watching the show, decided Ronstadt had to go -- for good. Timmins said he didn't allow Ronstadt back in her luxury suite and she was escorted off the property.   Ronstadt's antics "spoiled a wonderful evening for our guests and we had to do something about it," Timmins said.   Timmins said it was the first time he'd sent a performer packing.   "As long as I'm here, she's not going to play," Timmins said.   Ronstadt had been booked to play the Aladdin for only one show.   Calls to Ronstadt's manager were not immediately returned.   In an interview with the Las Vegas Review-Journal before the show, Ronstadt said, "I keep hoping that if I'm annoying enough to them, they won't hire me back."   Looks like she got her wish.     Is Las Vegas in that country they call the  "land of the free" ? &nbsp; For&nbsp;the love of god!...

      I was looking for something tonight that got me searching through piles of old magazines and stuff. In there, I found a bunch of enveloppes containing all my old issues of Leppard United. Started going through them all, to find the articles I had written and see if they were any good.   Well, I have to say I was first surprised by their number (I only remembered writing two or three) and their quality (considering how young and naive I was (ahem) and considering I actually learned English in this online (and offline) world of Def Leppard). Back when I used to write for LU, my English wasn't as evolved as it is today (now I like to think that I write almost as well as an English Canadian or an American, and surely better than a lot of them as well!). So I was surprised by the quality of my articles (maybe there was a bit of LU staff i.e. Laurie behind that good English).   Anyways, that got me back to the old times, when I was active on so many mailing lists, emailing with so many DL fans and chatting with them on IRC. That got me back to a time when  urlLink Dutchboy  and I had those long chats without doubting that I could of years later one of us would be planning to move across an ocean to be with the other. He would it on me 'cause he thought I was cute (really! he told me so!), I would hit on him 'cause I thought he was arrogant and I loved it, but we never thought we'd actually even meet. That got me back to a time when I was attending Lep conventions and organizing them (way before any LepCon), to a time when I was attending lots of DL concerts and meeting lots of friends. That was a fun time... most of the time. Of course there were bad times. People badmouthing, people complaining, people being jealous, etc. It's always been like that.&nbsp; But most of the time it was fun. &nbsp; Although I stopped being so active online since the last 3 years or so (being the webmaster's girlfriend got me more critics and enemies, or users,&nbsp;than anything else towards the end), I never stopped being a fan. After seeing all these LU newsletters, I decided to get out all my (autographed and not) pictures, all my ticket stubs, everything that I kept, just for fun. And although I don't talk about DL all the time anymore, although I rarely listen to them now, I'm still the biggest fan there is (yeah, I know, you think the biggest fan is  you , but I'm sorry to tell you you're wrong) and damn do I wish they were on tour right now. It's only been 9 months since the last concert (Vegas), but I need a fix. Watching the videos over and over again, night and day, like I used to do in college, doesn't do it anymore. I need a show. Because I'm such a groupie. &nbsp; Why am I ranting like this? I don't know. I guess sometimes I just wish things online could be as fun as they used to be 7 or 8 years ago. But with years flew by, the Internet became more popular, the community grew bigger, and with it, more bad apples to ruin it for the rest of us, and more newbies to repeat the same questions, the same comments and the same&nbsp;ideas over and over again. I guess you just can't keep going like we used to, posting on 5 mailing lists every day, trying to come up with meaningful reflections and insights. At some point, it becomes impossible. And so this blog is my only involvement remotely related to the DL world for the last year or so. Because here I can talk about whatever I want without people pissing and moaning about it. I'm lucky that none of the trouble-makers have found their way here or bothered with it.  &nbsp; I barely ever talk of DL anymore. I used to talk about them all the time, think about them all the time. You know what it's like, you've been there. They're still my favorite band, they will always be (notice that I say  favorite  -- I do not pretend in any way that they're the  best  band out there). And when I stop and think about it, they've influenced just about everything in my life: my passion for them taught me English (just ask anyone how my English was when I went to my first DL convention in 1997... odds are they'll tell you it was good, but the truth is I had to use my French/English dictionary while I was there!). Because of them and my insights on Malvin's career (watching him work and stuff), I decided to study into PR (although I never seriously dreamt or aimed at becoming their tour manager like so many out there want to) because it seemed so interesting and so much fun. Because of them, I made some (rare) true friends, that to this day I still visit once in a while, although I never really travel to concerts much anymore. Because of them, I found a love so great that nothing can stand against it, not even an ocean. Because of them, my life is pretty damn great!  &nbsp; I guess I was seeing my evolution in all this stuff I was looking at tonight. Now, if only DL could come out with a new album... It would be great to evolve some more! &nbsp;

      For whatever reason, I am overly anxious lately, and as a result, today was a totally crap day. I mean, I have no reason to be so nervous; there's nothing going on! Most people are on holiday, work is slow, and I do tons of yoga.   But a month ago, when I last saw my homeopath, she said things seemed to be doing too well and that it was still too early for my new remedy dose. She said to call her when my symptoms would be back. They're totally back now (I mean, my heart was beating like hell for like an hour before yoga class tonight. Absolutely ridiculous. I got there, told my teacher I was very anxious, she helped me install myself into  urlLink Supta Baddha Konasana  because this pose is very therapeutic and helps relieve stress... After 10 minutes of that and 5 minutes of meditation, my heart was back to normal... And I know, I know, I'm telling this on the wrong blog, but this is appropriate  here .), so I called up my homeopath and I have an appointment on Wednesday.   The only stressful thing is we're receiving Jeb Bush (the other's brother) tomorrow, as well as a delegation of 50 companies from Tampa on a trade mission and for a business luncheon, and we're expecting a lot of medias, but I'm not really involved in the project. I mean, I worked on it and tomorrow I have to welcome the media, but I didn't have to deal with the whole delegation so it's not much to be stressed about. Should be an interesting day, to say the least.   So, went to  urlLink my first Ashtanga class  tonight, now I am finally totally relaxed. Rented DVD 3 of Six Feet Under, so I'm gonna go and watch an episode before I go to bed. Three more nights and Dutchboy will be here! I'm gonna start counting the hours tomorrow...

      Vacation in 3 weeks, and  urlLink Dutchboy  and I are officially going  au pays des Cajuns  for 4 days/3 nights.   Pays des  what?   Cajuns.  You know, this little part in the South of the United States which stayed true to its French roots despite the fact that the English culture took over most of the continent a long time ago already.  Yeah baby, we're going to New Orleans! And I'm so excited about it! I've been wanting to go there for so long! New Orleans, to me, is so many things: it's a French culture (coming from my French Canada, which then evolved into something of it's own, with the fusion of the African American, the American, and the Haïtian cultures), it's a city of history, it's a city of superstitions, it's the city where my favorite fiction author bases her stories... It's just the most attractive American city to me, along with NYC, San Francisco, and Chicago. It's one of the very few American cities I feel like I  have  to visit, and I'm so glad I am finally going to get the chance to.  We found a ridiculously cheap deal that included the return flight and 3 nights in a 4 stars hotel right in the middle of French Quarter for less than C$600. Would be crazy to not take advantage of it! And 4 days is just enough I think... Not too much so you don't get tired of doing touristy things, just enough to get the feeling you're on vacation and visiting a totally new world, and it doesn't cost too much money either. Pretty reasonable. Pretty cool.   Hell, I need that. Last August, I went to Chicago for a week-end with my crazy friends (hey, you have to be to have seen DL live 104 times!)... We drove 10 hours to see DL in Sault-Ste-Marie. Then, in October, I went to Las Vegas. Stayed less than 72 hours there, didn't sleep much, saw DL in the most intimate venue ever. Those two last trips were a lot of fun, but they were not the same as my 3 days in Paris with Dutchboy in last July. You know, 3 days during which you can just go wherever you go, get up and go to bed whenever you want, visit whatever you wish, just walk around and enjoy the freedom of being on vacation. I want that. It's been over a year, and I need it. And I'm going to get it pretty soon! Can't wait!  May also go to NYC in mid-September, just for a week-end... but then again maybe not. We'll see.

      As I witnessed on a Montreal street today:   Absolutely crazy chick dancing in a very stupid way while walking with a friend.  Crazy chick sees slutty girl crossing the street.  Crazy chick almost jumps on slutty girl, yelling:   "-You! I know you!"   Slutty girl goes:   "-Hmm. I'm sorry. I don't know you. But you've probably seen me on television."  BWAHAHAHAHA!!!!  I think that's the stupidest random thing I've ever randomly heard anyone say on the street! I mean, come on, the slutty girl was well, slutty, had very tacky long blond hair, was barely 20 and was obviously doing everything to be noticed. If she's been on TV before, it had to be in a really bad home-made porn movie.  Absolutely hilarious. I wish someone had been there to laugh it off with me.  When it happened, I was coming back from getting a massage, which was quite an adventure in itself. To read about it, go to  urlLink my yoga blog .

      You know, when you wake up in a pissy mood, go to work in a pissy mood, and do everything in a pissy mood? This was one of those days. (God, I just did a research on "pissy" to make sure this expressed my feeling well and didn't mean anything else, and you wouldn't believe the Web sites I found! Ewwww... In this case, please read "pissy" as "very grumpy".)  Of course, not much good came out of it. One of my colleagues, whom I usually like very much, was absolutely getting on my nerves with her extremely childish ways, and just about everything everybody said pissed me off.   Ok well, I'm exaggerating, but barely! On the way back home, cranked Velvet Revolver's album really really loud in the car, and by the way I was back home, I felt much better.  There are just days like that... you can't do anything about them. Just wait until they're over.   P.S. No, I'm not PMS.

      So today, for the first time in 2 weeks, I was actually productive at work!   With half the people being on vacation, of course things are much quieter. The past two weeks were extremely relax... maybe even a bit too much. Didn't get a lot done. But then again, most people I needed to work with were on vacation, so there wasn't much I could do.  But today, our graphic artist was back, which allowed me to launch a production I had been wanting to launch for 2 months! I feel so relieve now that this is underway! And I was also able to see another production that is already underway advance a lot, and in the right direction, so that makes me really happy.  Went out for lunch with colleagues today, to celebrate the return of our graphic artist (she'd only been gone for 2 weeks but hey! any excuse is good to go out, right?!). Had pasta on a terrasse, with a view on  urlLink Cathédrale Notre-Dame  on one side, and the  urlLink Holiday Inn Centre-Ville Montréal in Chinatown  on the other side. The weather was so nice, we then went for a walk in the  urlLink Old Montreal  before returning to the office. God, I love this city!  Went to  urlLink yoga tonight , where I had a great practice and sweat like I've never sweat before. But sweat is good. Very cleansing.

      Another week-end with  urlLink Dutchboy  has come and gone. It's always a bit depressing to come back to my normal life once he's gone. It always feels even more empty than it did before.  I'm not saying my life feels empty, but of course being in a long-distance relationship isn't always easy and you do feel lonely, sometimes. The first night alone after spending quality time together always put emphasis of the loneliness part of the deal.  Well, we saw  urlLink The Village  this week-end.  SPOILER:  Not as scary as I expected it to be, but definitely a good twist at the end... And I have to say I didn't see it coming, even if I run the risk of seeming stupid because according to many of the media I've read over the week-end, the twist is very predictable. I didn't think it was. I wasn't even sure there was going to be one.  We had planned to go see elephants and tigers at the  urlLink Parc Safari  on yesterday, but the sky was absolutely pouring rain - there even was a small tornado just a few km from here - so that was out of the question. We rather had breakfast at the restaurant then went shopping.  So yeah, the week-end went by very quickly and, fortunately, next time, Dutchboy and I get a whole week of vacation together. Had plans of going either to Europe or to Cuba for a vacation, but we've decided it would be wiser, money-wise, to do smaller stuff. Go to the Parc Safari then, probably take the bus for a day or two in NYC... We'll see as it gets closer.  Back to work tomorrow... every day brings me closer to my first week of vacation since Christmas, and I like that!
