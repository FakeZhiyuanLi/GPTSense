      Happy Memorial Day everyone. Regardless of your position on current foreign and domestic situations, take a moment to remember those who died in the service of the United States of America. God bless them and their families. We are forever in their debt.

      Excuse the lack of blogging as of recent. I've been "busy" with school. And by "busy" I mean doing nothing but then suddenly... POOF!... finals week. Not that it's that big of a deal, but on top of it I've got the move coming up, and the SAT (I'm not worried, Mom is), and the Grandparents visiting.  Today I cleaned the kitchen, and I mean cleaned. Stove drip pans were scrubbed, refrigerator and freezer were emptied and scrubbed, and various other things that make it look quite fab if I do say so. Also I've started to shop for a new Mac. My little sage-colored iMac is showing its age of 4 years. I've done a lot with his 450 MHz G3, but Mac OS X 10.3.x is the highest it will probably ever run, and the 20 gig hard disk is filling up.  So, I'm looking at the eMac. It's cheap but powerful. The one I'm looking at is a 1.25 GHz G4 with CD/DVD burner and I'm upgrading the hard disk to 160 GB because I plan on doing some video editing on it. Nothing big, just some home video and projects, plus DVD copies of shows I get from TiVo (when I finally talk Mom into it). It's seems like a big purchase (the Digital Video camera I'll buy later), but all in all the computer will be less than the cost of my iMac. Kinda sad how prices work, isn't it?

      As part of Capital High's attempt to culture the student, once a week we go to a "Fine Arts" class with our History (1st semester) or English (2nd semester) class. Mrs. Snyder's pretty cool. I enjoyed the Jazz and impressionist units, but what I really liked was our most recent, and final project. We were given a list of songs we had listened to in class, and had to pick 3 that we liked. Then we were to pick 3 of our own songs, and make a CD and write 2 paragraphs (too little, really) about why we choose what songs we did. Not being one to waste a CD, I have 16 songs on mine (but only wrote about her 3 and 3 of mine, so I would keep my A in the class). The track list is as follows:     Maple Leaf Rag  – Scott Joplin *     It Had To Be You  – Frank Sinatra *     What A Wonderful World  – Louis Armstrong *     Hallelujah  – Rufus Wainwright    I Am What I Am  – Gloria Gaynor    Supermodel (You Better Work)  – RuPaul    Let's Hear It for the Boy (Factory Main Mix)  – Katty B. & Various Artists    Save The Last Dance For Me  – The Drifters    Flamboyant  – Pet Shop Boys    Crying at the Discotheque (Radio Edit)  – Alcazar    Forever Young (Queer As Folk Mix)  – Temperance    No Time At All  –  Pippin  - Original Broadway Cast    Head Over Heels  – Go-Go's    Dancing Queen  (Dance Mix)  – ABBA    Come Away With Me  – Norah Jones    C'est Ça Le Jazz (All That Jazz)  – Veronique DiCaire    So here is the breakdown. The first 3 (with the asterisk) are from her list. The rest are mine. Nine are from the show  Queer As Folk , 2 are from musicals, one is by Norah Jones ( Come Away With Me , very romantic in that jazzy kinda way), and one is by Rufus Wainwright ( Hallelujah ). So when you break it all down, only 4 of them are not gay in some way. Those would be Norah (I could debate that it could be, but...), and the first 3. The rest are from a musical, or by a gay artist, or from  QaF . If nothing else I had fun putting it together. All are good songs, so check 'em out.

      School is finally winding down, with just 7 more days of attendance left, finals included. Between now and then it's going to be some review and that's it. Granted I've got the SAT to take June 5th, but I'm not all that worried about it. Mom is freaking out enough for me though.  In these last couple weeks, the school finally realized how to properly block web sites from students, so now I can't get to Yahoo! Games, or my friend Joe's journal (granted he needs to go to Blogger), or even the AIM Express service. At least I can still get my e-mail and access Blogger and the other weblogs I read.  So, It's the middle of 3rd period now (no TV show today), and I'm sitting in front of a Windows 98 box passing the time. Why I'm even here today is beyond me; at least I got to sleep in until 7. In English today we got our grades for our papers, our presentation, and the class. I'm happy to report my percentages as 99% for the paper (we talk about them with Ms. Dollison tomorrow), 94% for the presentation, and 94% for the class. So as long as I do well on the final exam I'll have an A in English. Stupid 93%-is-the-lowest-A scale. If this disctrict followed the college (and normal in my opinion) scale I would have an A in allmost every class, and even then I would have a B to show for my 82%-ish grades that will show up as a C on my records. But enough of my complaining.

      I should just let it all go, but I swear, these conservative assholes really wear out my last nerve. It's all fine to have an opinion, but when you say AIDS is Gods punishment to gays and you've got more über conservatives agreeing and using the word "faggot" twice, and using their own little hateful word "homofag" at least twice with still others saying "I like the word homofag", I start to get really offended. All of you who can, go register to vote, and put Kerry in office. If you take away Bush, their so-called "Great Lord and War Hero", maybe they'll fall too.  It makes me sick. Very, very sick. Their views on the world is corrupt (homophobia, racism, religious intolerance) as well as their view on Christianity. They take it all a little to far, in my mind.

      If there is one thing I can't stand, that is conservatives. And I don't mean like the tolerable conservatives (I can't name any, but they're the moderate ones), I mean super freakish "my way and everyone else must burn in Hell" conservatives. Turns out  urlLink a small group of these evil people have formed a blog to get their "opinion" across . They've only got a handful of posts, and all of them in some way hatefully bash liberals or gays. Didn't we learn in debate that insults are the best way to get your point across? No, we didn't? That's what I thought. To top it off, they don't research their point first. They think that the phrase "Under God" was written into the Pledge by the Founding Fathers. Wrong. It was added by a 1954 Congressional Act. You're entitled to you opinion and all, but when you get your facts wrong, and use phrases like " Those liberal scumbags. They should have been the fisrt to be put in the concentration camps." to conclude, I'm sorry, but I'm just not going to even give you an ounce of respect, because based on your writings, you want to get rid of me and everyone else like me. As a matter of fact, you group gays in the same category as terrorists, i.e.: "Bush stood up to those damn Iraqi terrorists that caused Septemeber 11th (along with the homosexuals, of course)". If this is the future of America, then I'm scarred out of my mind.

      In keeping with the adorably cute theme I've had recently (see Sunday's entry on  urlLink Derrick Shore ), I present to you this young man. Randy Harrison, the actor who play's Justin Taylor on  Queer As Folk . I've always thought him hot, but then found a new level of hotness when  urlLink Mark  pointed out these pictures to me of Randy in glasses. In case you haven't caught on, I like a cute boy in glasses. I don't know what it is, but I just find them really, really hot. If you haven't seen Randy's work, you should. It's amazing; but then again the entire cast and show ( Queer As Folk ) is groundbreaking and spectacular.      Randy Harrison        Randy Harrison's recent look (the hair's short(er) again; it was longer for Season 3).

      I'm not saying (or admitting for that matter) that I've got a big ego or anything, but whatever ego I have feels really good after I get positive feedback on my work. Since I  urlLink wrote  and subsequently  urlLink published  my  urlLink research paper  on GLBT rights and inequalities, I've gotten some good feedback on it, including "…congratulations on an excellent paper! It was quite wonderful…" and "With young people like this one, the future is indeed bright for GLBT citizens!".  Thank you to everyone who's read it and commented on it. When I think about it, I have done a lot on this subject this year. Twice for a competitive event (Student Congress), this paper, and later this week (I think; depends on how the class goes) a debate on gay marriage in my Forensic Speaking class. I guess it all relates back to my strange love for the American Government, the Constitution, and my über liberalism.

      All I have to say is: "Oh My God!" and "[J.J.] Abrahms, you're a creative genious"! If you watch Alias and you saw this episode, you know just what I mean. I'm going to be in a state of TV depression until  Alias ,  The West Wing , and  Will & Grace  start again.  On a plus, Queer Eye starts again soon.

           I saw Pippin last night, and words can barely scratch the surface of how amazing it was. The entire ensemble was amazing, the musical direction was exactly what I would expect for this show, and the leading roles were outstanding. Bryan Archer as Pippin was a perfect match. Evie Victorson was perfect as Fastrada, right down the her shining moment in the number "Spread A Little Sunshine", complete with the choreography originally by Bob Fosse himself.  This being the second time I've seen Pippin on stage, as well as listening to the soundtrack, I really enjoyed myself. The first time I saw it was when my Middle School did Pippin as our Spring Musical. I also was part of the "War Is A Science" number during my Musical Theater class that year, so I know the words to a good number of the songs. All in all, it was a great way to spend Saturday night.

      If you go to my school, or any other school that shows "Channel One" each day, then you know Derrick Shore, the young anchor/reporter on the show. Well, he in the top 5 of my "Hot Guys" list. I'm not joking. He acts, he plays piano, he wears glasses, he does TV stuff. In short, he's really, really, really super hot. Not just hot, cute. That's a lethal combo, hot and cute. If I had to sum up the perfect guy that I'd date in a snap, it would be him. Plus, he listens to Janet Jackson, Madonna, and Sarah Brightman; and just last week quoted a line from  Gypsy . If a picture is worth a thousand words, then be warned.      Derrick is on the far right. Seth is on the far left (he's a cutie too), and I can't remember the girls name... she used to work for Channel One, or still does. Obviously I don't pay attention to her.        Derrick again. Isn't he just so cute?!

      Very appropriate title, I think. First off it's the name of a song from  La Cage Aux Folles  (a French play, then French movie, then B'way musical;  The Birdcage  was based off it). The best versions of the song are by Linda Eder on the album "Broadway, My Way" and a more Disco-esque hit by Gloria Gaynor. The song has become an anthem of sorts in the gay community, and rightfully so. Secondly, it's kinda-sorta my little theme. It's very singable and very happy and proud. I listen to it and I feel more happy than I was when I started, even if I was in a horrible "fuck the world" mood or a fantabulous "I just got hit on by cute boys" (I wish!) mood.  Today should be fun. I've got Stephie's graduation cookout followed by the musical  Pippin  at 8. Also Mom gets back in about 22 hours, so I need to get the house all cleaned. She's made an offer on this really nice house I hope we get. Then it's time to pack up all of my junk and get ready to leave. it's coming up fast on me. At least we aren't moving the day after school's over like last year.

      In the past week, my Mom has had more air travel problems then she needs. Her flight to Chicago for her  urlLink dissertation defense  was delayed, then canceled, so she had to take a flight the next day. Not fun. Then yesterday her flight to Chicago (again, this time connecting to KC) was delayed, then canceled. The wonderfully (un) helpful airport people thought it would be fun to put her on a Delta flight to Cincinnati that would connect to Kansas City's Mid Continental Airport. Well, I know to avoid Delta like the plague, since the only airline I've had the best time with is United. Long story short, she made it to KC today just fine. Yes, today. They wouldn't hold the connection flight for even 10 minutes, and so she was suck in Cincinnati for 12 hours at the skanky Cincinnati airport.  I seem to be blogging more lately. This is good. Now I just need to actually get out and do something. But I've got no money, and Gap calls to me like, well, it just calls for me to buy some new jeans, pants, and shirts. It could be the fact that the vast majority of cute guys who work at the mall work there, but I think it's more the couture.

      Just another boring weather-crazy Wednesday in the WVa. Lots and lots of rain this morning with nice temperatures (until you got  inside  the school, then you were freezing your ass off) followed by the damn sun making it hot and humid. I jut can't win in this state.  Today was the last day of classes for the Seniors, so from henceforth I'll be part of the leading class. Not that I'm special or anything among my peers, but it's fun to feel on top. I think that the powers held by Seniors should be transfered to Juniors upon abdication, like getting out for lunch 5 minutes earlier (makes all the difference, trust me). But alas, Mr. Beasley will have none of that going on. At least Physics is fun.  I have the suspicion that Josh skipped school today (and last Friday). Today and Friday he was home when I got home at 3:40. He said Friday was a power problem and today was some teacher promotion. I think it is a load of BS. He cracked more or less about today, but he's set about Friday's events. Whatever. Mom believes the little twit anyway, so I guess it doesn't matter. He thinks he so clever too, but his IM has been logged in since 11:30 this morning on Mom's iBook and he  NEVER  leaves it open unattended, plus it's 11:30 no matter how you slice it. I've only skipped a whole day once Freshman year, but he's in 7th grade and not doing fabulously well (good, but not stellar). He keeps it up he'll be a drop out.

      I know, I know. So many posts in just one day. What can I say, I've got a lot to talk about and no one but the Blogger will listen to me. Just wanted to get one last little post in before the clock tells me its Wednesday and you need to be up in 6 hours (not that I'd listen to it; who listens to a clock!?). Anyhow, I've met to cool people via this blog: Mark and Justin. Both of them are on my "Frequently Read Blog" list, and both are very cool people. Hi guys!  General "Note-To-Self" (from Justin): Look up the book "A Destiny of Souls" by Christopher Rice.

      Yes friends, it is that time again. The time when all of the amazing theatrical talent in New York City comes together to recognize this years great musicals and other theatrical performances. The Tony's air June 6th on CBS.  In nomination news,  Avenue Q  has 6 nods to its name, including Best Actor and Actress (John and Stephanie are AMAZING, and I haven't even seen the show)!       Other shows that are nominated include  The Boy from Oz  and  Wicked . Congratulations to all nominees and I can't wait to see the awards!

      If you know me or read my earlier entries on Kansas City then you would know that I'm moving there and I'm really really super excited to go. Not that America is so gay-friendly right now, but it  is  Kansas after all. Lucky for me its the Kansas City area and not Salina or Hays or Dodge City (you know these places if you're from Kansas); hell I'm doin' fine in West Virginia. The "hope for me in Kansas" isn't really that big of a deal, or all that directly related to me.  Getting to the point, if you watched the Miami season of  The Real World , then you know  urlLink Dan Renzi . I don't remember Miami all that well, and I actually forgot he was gay (I know, I know, how dare I forget such a thing)! As I was reading and clicking about  urlLink Steph & Alek 's blog I came across Dan's blog and started reading it. What can I say, I love reading other people's life. It's really cool, you should try it (err, wait... you are). The point of the story: he's from the KC area and he's really cute. So there are cute boys in KC, you just have to find them first. That's the hard part. You can't just walk up to any guy and hit on 'em; that's how you get your ass kicked in the Midwest.

      It's only Tuesday, but it feels like a Wednesday. I don't really know why. The Seniors have their finals this week, and they're all leaving. Stephie, Mike, Elizabeth, Sara, essentially most of my friends. This means that LiveEye will become anchored by Shane, Camron, and Jerricka. Jerricka is good, Shane is decent, but Camron just can't do it. He needs to learn how to read the script before going live to the whole school. It makes us look bad. This does mean, however, that I will take Logan's job as director for the rest of the year, a job I am looking forward to.

      The one bad thing about WVa in the spring is it rains almost constantly, and if it isn't then it rained recently and is really hot and humid. I know that Kansas and Missouri are really humid too, but they don't always look at the 10 Day [Forecast] and sigh knowing that rain or scattered storms are on the horizon (the storms usually never being anything to even talk about with the cat). Is it so much to ask for a week of mostly sunny, 73 degree weather?  In other news, the Starbucks at the mall is coming along quite well and soon I'll be enjoying my (slightly) over-priced mocha by the waterfall.

      Other than  urlLink Mom finally being "Dr. Mom" , today post-school has been really dull. While waiting for the bus I talked to Tasha, Nikki, and Nikki's mom, and decided that we (Tash, NikNik, and myself) should go see a movie tonight or tomorrow. Obviously tomorrow is when its gonna happen. Mike was supposed to give me a call or stop by after his dentist appointment, but I guess he couldn't talk post-op.  So it's just been me, Josh, and the cat. Nothing good is EVER on TV Fridays since NBC killed  Miss Match  and FOX doesn't know what to do with  Playing It Straight . In the next few hours I'm going to find  something  to do else I go crazy. If I could drive I'd go rent a movie or two (or a whole TV series season on DVD). The day's accomplishments have been few, consisting only of cleaning up my nails (they were not so pretty) and getting a good number of the  Jeopardy!  answers correct.  Miss Davika has reminded me that  Pippin  is playing this and next weekend. It easily ranks as one of my most favorite musicals ever, and they pull it off  soooo  well she says.  L-oving it!

      Well, it has taken 8+ years, but the payoff is finally here! My Mom is in Chicago this weekend to defend her dissertation study. And as of right now, she's  Doctor  Lisa R. Hale. How f-ing cool is that! She's got her Ph.D. and a great job in Kansas City. I'm so proud of her! Go Mom Go!

      As promised, here is the text of the research paper, in Adobe PDF. You'll need  urlLink Adobe Acrobat Reader  (or Preview on Mac OS X) to view it.  A few little footnotes. First of all, this is all my original work. Quotations and paraphrasing is properly cited (as "proper" as the damn school wanted it anyways), with a  Works Cited  page included. Second, don't steal or copy. That's just bad taste. Quote if you like, but please give credit where credit is due (in other words: cite properly). Third, let me know any error you find in wording (like a misspelling that I didn't catch). I'll fix it and republish and give you credit if your ego likes that. :)   urlLink Research Paper (Adobe PDF, 116KB)

      So, its the end of a long day of schooling and I'm on my way home. Not in my car (Sadly, I have a car but I can't drive as of yet... how crazy is that!?) but on the damned bus. Not my usual A/C-equipped bus mind you, but some different one that's all older and clunky. Anyway, the point of this rambling story is a friend of mine, Zack, is sitting across from me, talking to some sophomore girl (who's name escapes me) in the seat in front of me. The subject of their conversation is the recent Iraqi prisoner scandal and the  urlLink recent execution of American Nick Berg . While I knew of both these accounts and am happy to say I stay on top of the news, both of them were oblivious the these incidents until the other night. Frankly, I was appalled. Their reasoning is that the world is full of bad stuff that they would rather not deal with, so they don't watch the news; "ignorance is bliss" they say.  In my opinion, ignorance is not bliss. It's ignorance that gets Bush elected into office and ignorance is the keystone of discrimination throughout history. It saddens me to see how lazy teens are these days. They don't know current events, they don't care about politics, and they don't get involved in the community or a worthy cause. Ask Zack who the  urlLink DNC  Presidential candidates where and he couldn't tell you. (For record, they were John Edwards, Dennis Kucinich, Al Sharpton, Carol Mosley Braun, Wes Clark, Howard Dean, Dick Gephardt, and Joe Leiberman, with John F. Kerry taking the party nomination). I hope these kind of people never vote; they'd walk into a booth and start punching a name.

      I abhor research papers, almost to the point of burning them when I'm finished. I love writing essays, and I even love investigative/research essays and journalism. But when I'm given a you-must-do-this-many-notecards format, I get sick of it. I don't like guidelines placed on my work. I know the point is for kids to be organized and properly cite when writing, but I already do that quite well if I do say so. So 13 pages later (outline and works cited pages included), I'm done. The "recommended length" is 4-6 pages, but I never fit in such ranges. I write a lot, and I write to make a point. I  can  condense my writing, but only in a journalistic way. For a research paper  you need to explain and analyze. Plus, my topic (the freedoms and rights of gays in American government and society) covers Constitutional rights, social issues, and criminal law, and each one of those has 3 supporting instances (i.e.:  Lawrence v. Texas ,  Bowers v. Hardwick , and  Limon v. Kansas  for criminal law).  And now, at 2:19 in the AM the printer has done its work. Good night all, and I'll see you in the morning!

      I got into the whole weblog thing maybe 10 months ago, in June of 2003. Back then I used my little iMac as a server over the broadband connection. Since then I've been blogging off and on, with many changes along the way, all of them I didn't really keep for a long time. Well, today that all changes.  The first foray into the world of blogging was with Blogger before I moved to West Virginia. Back then it wasn't what I wanted. I had aspirations for a really cool blog that  needed  PHP and such. So, like I said, I used my little iMac for that purpose. But now I've come to realize that a short web address, a permanent web address, and the new Blogger are what I need. If you are looking for a new weblog or are thinking of starting, I really suggest Blogger.  So welcome to my new weblog, where I will try more than ever to update at least once a day, if not more.

      I need a new camera, a digital one. I hate having to scan in pictures every time I need them, and when I do they're old and dated because I take forever to finish a roll of film. If I'm using the "instant" Polaroid camera Mom swears by then the images are bad, and I mean bad. So I need a digital camera. But with my mother good luck with that. Love her to death but let go a little and let me live.  OK, I really should be packing, but I don't want to, so that's the main reason behind this, nothing more or less. I'm going to miss my blog so much. And I'm going to miss talking to people online. * sigh *

      This moving thing now officially sucks more than it did. I just want to magically click my heels and *POOF* I'm in Kansas ready to have a life again. I'm going to be cut off from the internet for God knows how long, so I'll talk to everyone when I do rejoin the digital world. Bye!

      Thank you Yahoo Messenger for shutting me off from the service because I don't use your pitiful excuse for a client.  urlLink Fire  is such a better alternative because I can use it for both AIM and Yahoo Messenger. For now I guess I'm keeping the Yahoo-branded messenger open lest I miss an e-mail notification or my friends who use it. Shame on Yahoo, and good luck to the Fire developers on working around this.

      Moving in general sucks big time. But the end result, in my case, has many,  many  positives. One really big problem with moving is the food (or lack of). It's amazingly hard to cook something when all the cookware and utensils are packed (or in the process of) and you're going for a Darwinian refrigerator. Looks like more eggs, cheese, and tortillas for me tonight.

      A short and sweet ode to my very very very fabulously great amazing excellent friend Alycia. She can always help me with stuff even when she can't directly do anything. If I didn't live so far away and was straight (*gasp*, I know) I would so snatch her up. I love you girl. Don't ever change.

      I thought West Virginia was landlocked and didn't get monsoons. Oh, these aren't monsoons, they're just freakishly high winds and a deluge of rain in a short period of time? One and the same in my book. Can I please go back to the midwest where the weather for the day is predictable and not stupid. I hate storms that just turn out to be some rain and the occasional lightening. Where are my severe midwest storms, damn it?!

      Some say yes, I say it's a little strange. But certainly not normal, in terms of the general population's music libraries. But in my case they're all "I Am What I Am", which is like  the  song for gay pride, so I guess that makes it totally acceptable. So all of you proud gay people go and get at least one version of the song. It's great. Oh, and don't mind my silly posts today. I've had a good day that involved lots of Diet Coke.

      Every now and again I discover a new artist (to me or otherwise) on iTunes or via a friend. Today while browsing the new releases on the iTunes Music Store I came across Ryan Cabrera's first wide-release single. The Dallas, Texas singer/songwriter is, I find, quite enjoyable to listen to. Some artists just have that style and voice that you can just play in the background and get caught up on it. It probably doesn't help that he's cute, too. Anyways go check him out and look for his Atlantic Records debut sometime this summer.

      They just happen to live 60 miles from Kansas City in Topeka. Isn't it funny how you can stumble into a guy who's looking for what you are, is adorable, speaks French, and doesn't smoke or do drugs but lives so far away it's not immediately feasible until I can drive? * sigh * Being gay is such hard work.   Update:  I've decided to get my self-esteem level up enough to the point of IM-img him or something. What do I have to loose? But to get myself to that point I'm going to need advice and support of my best friends. Some of you know who you are, others of you may not realize that you are. Essentially this means you Alycia, Justin, Mark, "ShanBaby", and Erika. I figure why not get support on my side and go for it. He's adorable like you can't even imagine, and he's actually looking for a relationship and tired of people looking for random sex. Again, why not try it. He's already on my "Hot List". You people just listed: talk to me and I'll get you a pic.

      I was supposed to hang with Mike today, but he never showed. I waited outside Taylor Books for almost 40 minutes and then decided that he wasn't going to show. I went to the mall alone and got myself a Dasani and  The Hours  by Michael Cunningham. This isn't the first time he's done this, but he is unreachable by normal means since his Mom is a complete whack job and doesn't let him use the phone. Oh well, the mall sucks on Sundays anyhow.

       Gay Dating and My Social Life Thus Far   A not-so-mini essay by Ryan Zachary Hale    What is it with the world today? Why the fuck is it so hard to find a boyfriend? Sure in the middle of West Virginia what can one expect; but can Shawnee, Kansas really be any better? Capital High School only has 1,400 kids, Shawnee Mission North is only 400 more. Is it even possible for there to be a cute/attractive, kind, loving,  available  gay senior? Hell, I'd take a junior. I'd even date from a different school, but how fucking cool would it be if I had a boyfriend at school? It would be like the gay power couple or something, especially if we didn't bother with hiding it. I'm not saying we have to make out in class, but people notice things, right? That's the thing, I don't want to look back on my last, my final, my  senior  year and regret any moment of it. I want to have my  first  boyfriend. I want to go to prom with him. I want to enjoy high school the way you see it on TV, and movies, and just walking around any school in America. Why does gay dating in high school have to be so hard? Straight people are always hooking up with one another and they're everywhere you look. Sure, the whole homophobia and violence around my sexual preference is a problem, but in these bigger schools do we really have to worry about such things?  I'm not trying to sound conceited or anything, but I'm damn cute. Sure, I'm not the most attractive person in the world, but we all can't be models now can we? I'm smart, funny, opinionated, loving, loyal, etc., so why, exactly, does everything seem to just not work? I've come a long way since 3 years ago as the new kid, the incoming freshman, from a middle school of 600 in Suburbia, USA to a high school of 3,200 in Evanston (North Shore/North Side, Chicago). Freshman year I didn't do that well in some classes. I missed work, didn't do projects, and got my first D on a grade report. It really jolted me awake, and I brought every grade up. I didn't have any friends, save for the occasional banter with people in class, and the few friends I had. I'm grateful I knew them. They are all fabulous. Notably the ones I still talk to: Alycia and Taylor: you guys rule. We have to visit sometime; I miss you. As for my other friends, I wish I still talked to them more or even talked to them at all after that first year. I made some more friends Sophomore year for sure, but basically kept the same group.  As I was talking with  urlLink Mark  (Who along with Justin are two people who are always there to talk to, be it superficial or if I've got a problem. They may not be able to do anything directly, but having someone there is just as amazing.) last night, I looked back at my two years at Evanston, and realized how depressing they were until the very, very end. I also remember the people who subconsciously made a difference in my life. I barely remember these people, and I haven't talked to them since my freshman Biology class. Sally, Sophia, and Evan. They were basically the only people I really talked to in that class. They just made me feel so at ease. They were honestly the first group of "gay friends" I ever really knew. Before that I had no idea what these people were like. I thought that what I was feeling was some strange problem or something connected to the fact that I wasn't "cool" or "with the in-crowd" in middle school. Without them knowing, or even myself then, I started to realize who I am now. They were funny, and made me laugh, and were the most genuinely nice people you could meet. Evan especially just made you feel really comfortable. He was cute too. I realized that the first day I walked into the class, and I wish I had been able to accept myself then as I do now. For the longest time I had Sally's email, but I've lost it now. A Google search for her turns up nothing, but a Google search for Evan turns up what college he's going to, and even lists contact info (I'm not stupid enough to put it here). I know it's him, it's an Evanston address, and it says Evanston Township. I should email him just to say hi and see if he even remembers me, just for old times sake. I didn't realize he was a Junior when I was a Freshman, so I would have seen him my Sophomore year at least. Maybe I just don't remember. I feel like a bad friend now, you know? I need to talk to Alycia, and bad, and on the phone. She's the best girlfriend I've got, and she listens so well and would know what to do and even who I'm talking about even if I don't. She's amazing. No, she's fabulously divine. She's the first really-super-good-friend I came out to, and I'm proud of that. I could trust her with my life.  Moving onwards away from E-Town now. My sophomore year was uneventful and basically Freshman year with better classes and cooler classmates... I did make some new friends, like Nathan, and Jess, and Nate (who I really need to talk to again), but other than that the same old thing. Charleston was a new experience. I fit in quickly at Capital, thanks to the cool friends I've made here, and the fact that I was coming from a school almost 3 times it's size and from the big city, so I felt a little cocky about the whole thing. Junior year was great. Good grades, great fabulous friends, did well on the SAT, oh, and came out to others for the first time. I don't know if I would have done the same if I was still at Evanston. The atmosphere there was just so different, but I guess these things happen when we're ready for it. I got to know Mike, who's hilarious in his own quirky way and just has this way about him that you can't help but love. He's great with kids too, so he'll make an amazing teacher. I actually got out and did stuff. Tasha and Nikki were the other part of my trio of good friends here. We'd go see a movie just to check out the cute guys in it, or we'd go and spend a whole day at the mall walking around and having a blast or watching movies until 12:30 AM and having my mom come get me from Kanawha City without telling here where I was.  Despite my great year here in WV, and my amazing friends and experiences in Chicago, I still was never part of that clichéd popular social upper class that everyone yearns to be a part of at some point. I would kill to know the cool people and hang out with them and be in the know. I yearn for the spotlight and celebrity associated with it. You're self image takes shape as a child, and for me middle school was hell. I loved parts of it, but I was one of those kids that wasn't part of the popular group because I didn't play sports or have parents who made a certain amount of money or knew the same people since kindergarten. In a way middle school is more of a bitch than high school ever could be, just because it's so small and cliché. That kind of negativity stuck with me at E-Town, and I'm just now getting over it. Because none of the "cool" kids never even wanted anything from you but a cheap laugh or an answer to the question they couldn't get because they were goofing off in class, I had this isolated anti-social mentality. I've learned to get over that in most situations, but everything comes back to dating. One gets this idea that you should just "know what to do" when it comes to asking a guy out or that nervous first date and first kiss. Well life ain't so easy. In fact it's one of the hardest things to deal with. On top of the problems of normality preceding this sentence, you've got the more current issues to deal with. Today teenagers and early 20-somethings are too focused on the sexual aspects of it all. They don't want that romantic dating of decades past. They just want to find some girl to fuck or some guy to give it up to. I find it disgusting how there is not intimacy behind it all and it has become a game to some people. Not that I don't believe in sexual relationships, but don't fuck someone on the first date, or even the second or third. Wait until you really feel ready and right about it, and not listen to some guy who's gonna sweet-talk you into it by saying he loves you and crap. Some guys will say anything just to get you in bed. And when you do actually decide to do it, don't be stupid. Too many people have diseases these days for you to not use protection. You're saving yourself massive cost, humiliation, and health risks later on. You have so much to live for, so don't waste it on one poor decision.  This became much more than I intended. It was a rant on dating. Then it became a mini-therapy session for me. Then I started ranting about the problems of relationships. And frankly, I don't care. When I get in these moods I just need to vent. And in this case, the parts about me became a therapeutic experience. I may be talking to no one, or the world, but at least I got it out and I don't have to keep it all in my head. It's a good thing and it helps keep me sane.

      No, not the "pop star". My friend from Capital. She's just so funny, and you can't help but follow along when you see something funny she's put in her profile. For example:    "Love [ My response: ] Only when you actually have it. Otherwise you spend every bit of free time wishing you had a charmingly cute boyfriend you could take to the mall and make the single straight girls and all the fags jealous of while at the same time giving a visible "fuck you" to the stupid straight boys of the world.    And that's exactly what I would do with my charming and cute boyfriend. Why? Because I can, and because I'm not going to keep myself and my boy secluded away while the breeders are literally reproducing right in front of me.

       urlLink Andy  provides info and a link to the trailer of the new movie  A Home at the End of the World , based on the novel by Michael Cunningham (author of  The Hours  as well). I've yet to see or read any of his work, but I know people who rave about it. Plus, you have to love an openly gay novelist who writes fabulous novels.

      So I had Mom do my hair last night before  Sex And The City  came on TBS. It may be disgustingly cleaned up for TV, but its still an hour of "great sex". Because it's summer and because it was too long last time, I wanted it short, but still able to style it and not look like I'm going to Boot Camp. She did a good job, yet again, and I like it. I've always liked my hair shorter. It's so soft and easy to manage. I can wake up and apply hair products as needed for the look I want. And as I went around the house today, I noticed that I look alarmingly cute with shorter hair. Even more so with that faux earring thing I've become too attached to. But enough of my talking about myself for one 15 minute block.

        urlLink According to an MSNBC article (via the Associated Press) , Republicans in the U.S. Senate will seek a vote to ban same-sex marriage next month, around July 12th, just a week before the  urlLink DNC  Convention in Boston, Mass. where Sen. John F. Kerry will formally accept the party nomination. Many Republicans admit that they lack the votes to pass such an amendment to the U.S. Constitution, and as such the Democrats charge that the GOP is pushing this as a divisive issue and to rally the conservative base of the GOP. Colorado Republican Sen. Wayne Allard said during a Capital Hill news conference "We don't consider this a divisive issue. Support for this amendment comes from a cross-section of America". Other GOP Senators, such as Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, assert that they "didn't pick this battle... this was thrust upon us [by activist judges and Massachusetts and California]".  Democratic Presidential nominee John Forbes Kerry, Senator from Massachusetts, opposes amending the Constitution to ban gay marriage, and like other Democrats supports the states-rights issue of the ordeal being left up to individual states. Sen. Allard refused to give details on vote counts, but did state that he believes there is "a lot of support" for the issue. Even if the U.S. Senate confirmed such an amendment, it would take a two-thirds vote of both the Senate and House of Representatives followed by three-fourths of the 50 states ratifying the amendment before it would formally become part of the Constitution.  This legislation is among other conservative amendments in Congress that have little hope of passing, such as another proposed forced vote on an anti-flag burning amendment. Polls show that American's don't favor gay marriage, but that they thing the war in Iraq, healthcare, and the economy are more important in this November's elections.   Frankly this is just pre-election crap the GOP is tossing about because they fear losing the election to Kerry, and they have nothing else to offer but rally their freakishly conservative right-wing followers in their favorite past-time: bigotry, discrimination, and homophobia. Frankly these "activist judges" are all serving the good of the people by interpreting the Constitution in the most equal sense. Their job is not to keep America narrow-minded, but to broaden her to be inclusive of everyone. I found it comical that Bush could visit the site of  Brown v. Board of Topeka, Kansas  on the 50th Anniversary of such a landmark even in American equality and call it a "good thing". Were the nine U.S. Supreme Court justices on that case not "activist judges" as well? Didn't they greatly change the institution of American education and help strengthen the Civil Rights movement about a decade later? What's the difference here? Judges are trying to give gay Americans the same rights the rest of the country has. It is interesting to note that Christians, Jews, Muslims, Bhuddists, B'hai, Atheists, Agnostics, etc. can all get married here in the United States, whether the two people involved are of different race or religion, or even have no religion at all, as long as they are still a Man and a Woman. What, exactly, is being protected by discriminating against gay Americans? This can't be a religious issue, because as I said different religions can marry, and atheists can marry. Plus religious doctrine should not and cannot interfere with civil laws. This also can't be a biological issue, since people incapable of having children can wed, and some married people choose not to have children. So really the defense is quite weak, but Americans keep getting pummled with lies from the Republicans and religious whacko's. There is some legislation in Congress now who's purpose is to undo the "damage" of the courts. The religious cable networks have huge misleading infomercials on it, and even contradict the Constitution. The first Amendment says that Congress shall not make any laws with respect to religion, but this legislation specifically mentions the word "God", exactly as I have it (without the quotes) and in the Christian context.  As a postscript, one of the "commentators" for that infomercial was Pat Buchanan. No surprise there, as the best way to make people believe in your crap is to get an über-conservative ass who's all talk and no facts on screen to talk about the evils of homosexuality. Would you really take this man seriously, a man who believes Sen. Joseph McCarthy was "a patriot", Adolf Hitler was "a man of great courage" and that AIDS is "retribution" for the homosexual "war against nature"? So if myself and the rest of the gays are waging a war against nature, why, exactly are we still here? And why have we been here since civilization began? I think it's about time America wages war on intolerance, homophobia and inequality and gets the GOP out of the government.

      I don't like lots of piercings, and I only like them to be on the ear. Anywhere else and it's a little freaky. Girls can get a belly ring if they've got the stomach. Anyway, my point is that I'd only get my ear pierced, and even then only on one side (probably left, just because; or maybe right... damn). Today while rummaging around the house because Mom is at work and Josh is at a friends house until tomorrow, I found some little gold round thing that looks like it came from one of Josh's toys or something of Mom's. Turns out that I can pry it open, sand the edges down with a file, and wear the thing as if I had a little gold earring. Fun stuff. It actually looks pretty cool and no pain or self-mutilation involved! All I have to do know is remember to take it off when Mom's around or the family is near, I don't think any of them would take to well to that. But it is one good way of sneakily coming out to all of them.

      And I did pretty damn good if I do say so. Mom had no idea what good was or even what the SAT is comprised of, so I had to explain the two scores out of 800 and the composite out of 1600. I think she gets it now. So my scores and percentiles are:    Section&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Score&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Percentile   Math&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;610&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;77 Verbal&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;650&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89 Composite&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1260

      (It's 3AM here on the East Coast and I can't sleep. Forgive me for any misspellings and whatnot. I'll fix 'em later, and remove this story killer blurb.)  So I'm enjoying my dinner at the seafood mecca Red Lobster and Mom comments on Josh's grooming and that he needs to start shaving (see prior post on my bitching about Josh... but don't they just grow up so fast?) and I tell him he can have my current electric one because it no longer works for me that well and I want a traditional manual blade and "shaving product" method. Closer shave that way, you know; plus there is some exfoliation something involved... I just pick this up from your friendly hunky-grooming-guru Kyan Douglas. If you don't know who he is then shame on you. So Mom makes a comment along the lines of "Really? Has you boyfriend been complaining?". What!? Is she crazy? Why would she even think I'm dating someone? I've told her I'm not before when she brings this up. I don't leave the house hardly ever now that school's out, and certainly not on Fridays or Saturdays. I don't get phone calls from people and go to my room and talk to them for long periods of time. Plus, she's so on a need-to-know basis. She doesn't tell me who she's dating (if anyone) right off the bat, so why should I. Sure I'm her kid and under 18, but she could be a little less controlling about my personal life. There's a bad story about that I'd rather not get into right now, or possibly never on this blog... feel free to talk with me if you're dying to know. Not to say I don't  want  a boyfriend.. God knows I do, to the point that I get all mopey when I perseverate on it. Hence my signing up for Gay.com in the slight chance some cute boys are on there that feel like talking to me or I actually get the balls to talk to. In any even it was one of those out-of-the-blue and random things my Mom does. Love her for it most of the time (she broke out into singing Barbara earlier), but some times its way to random and just makes me realize how sad I  am  can be.

      So all of you know, I've got a new principal email (I discussed this the other day, but I thought I'd make it more separate). You can get it from  urlLink my profile . Also I've got  urlLink Fire  set up now for my Yahoo! Messenger account in addition to my AIM, so I'll be on both at once now. The Yahoo! ID is the same as my AIM one, so if you use Yahoo! or both like me feel free to contact me and talk and if you're cool enough (and/or cute :D) I'll add you to my Buddy List (that goes for both Yahoo! and AIM).  Also, I've official changed my location to my new home in Shawnee, KS.

      So I went to the eye doctor today, and it turns out my prescription hasn't changed. So in addition to my new ones, I can still keep and use my old (current) ones. Always one to hunt out cute clothes or accesories at bargain prices, I gave Wal-Mart's Vision Center a try. After all, I did get my current ones there (as for my first pair almost 7 years ago, I don't remember how I got them, except for the underlying 'mo in me didn't say "NO FOOL! They're ugly and big and don't match your face!"... 2 years later I corrected the issue. And today I got myself 2 new pairs. The first are normal glasses. The frames are black, and thicker than the wire ones I have now, and only surround half the lens. This picture either is or is 99% the frame I chose:       The other frame is for my new prescription sunglasses, since I'll be driving and such. They look sorta like my current ones, but silver and more round/eliptical (less boxy at the bottom). I don't have a pic of them, but I'll get some of me wearing both pairs as soon as I can using whatever photographic means I have access to.

      Love him to death, but the kid can be such a bitchy little ego-laden 13 year old. He doesn't do his chores when he is supposed to, and when he finally does they're done half-assed. He doesn't give a damn about school, he spends nearly all of his free time with online role playing crap or watching gaming stuff on G4TechTV or crappy anime on Cartoon Network, and he's rude. I can be rude to him sometimes, but that's only because the only way he'll listen to you is if you get in his face and yell. Plus he doesn't do well with self-care. Tonight Mom was dishing out the haircuts and Josh needs his done because he has hair like Shane (Dad) and he's got a birthday sleep-over party tomorrow (thank you God!). But no, he doesn't want it cut. He said it's fine. It isn't. It's all scruffy-in-a-bad-way and he looks like a burn-out punk. And tonight Mom realized that he has no deodorant. So guess what? He gets to have the one I just got tonight at Wal-Mart and I can "make do" with what I've got left 'till we move. Like Mom's gonna have time after we move. Good grief.

      So I'm getting ready to go to sleep, but before I do I check my Yahoo email and then Gay.com just because that's what I do several times a day (to see if I've got new messages or check news and the culture of, as Mom put it, "my people"). So I swear I'm just going to read this interview, and then about this gay rocker, and I do. But no, I can't sleep yet, because iTunes is slow at ripping CDs. I'm not doing that many: a Bree Sharp CD, a Sarah McLachlan CD, a song or two from other McLachlan albums and a Patty Loveless song. Should only take a few minutes, right? Nope. The whole process took slightly more than 30 minutes. That's my one issue with iTunes.

      Unlike yesterday, I feel productive. While yesterday I packed 0 boxes and took a 2.5 hour nap, today I packed 8 boxes (books AND CDs) and took a 2+ mile walk. I'm getting the walking part, but I need to stop eating crap. But the move takes a lot of time and I can't say no to a pie even if I feel disgustingly sick afterwards. Enough excuses though.  My arm actually hurts today where I got my tetanus shot (Just the every-10-years deal; I didn't step on a nail thank God!). I think it's more of a combo of the shot and lifting heavy boxes and flailing my arms about trying to keep the damn bugs away from me along the Blvd. while walking. Tomorrow I get an eye exam and some new glasses so that should be fun. Downside: Have to go to Sam's Club and Wal-Mart. I loathe Wal-Mart with a passion, notably the one here. You get so many people from the "hollers" there that I like to entertain myself with "Mullet Hunting". Unless I find some cute glasses frames there or Mom makes me get some there, I'm definitely looking at some frames at Lenscrafters. Maybe some Armani ones if they've got some small-ish dark non-wire rim frames. I'll know more tomorrow, naturally. I'll post a pic of me in them when I can, if not then definitely the frames or something similar to it. I hate not having a digital camera.  Since I'm moving soon and my email will change, I've changed my email address on the profile to my Yahoo account. I'll be sending out emails to the people who's emails I have, and the rest of y'all can get it from the profile. I'm debating getting another one with the DSL account from SBC for the family, since I don't really want Grandma sending forwards to the family and having mine show up as what it is. Not that I have a problem with it, but it's my family, and that's a little odd.  One last thought before I go to bed. My other grandmother, on Dad's side, called tonight and wanted to know if Josh and I want to go to Utah near the end of July to visit my half brother and sister Tristan and Madison. I haven't seen them in years and they're soooooo cute now, so I feel obligated to go. Part of me wants to go, but part of me doesn't. I don't know if I could take drive out there with Fred smoking the whole way, and then having to be out there for 10 days or something and not talk to my friends, or Blog (maybe an audioBlog or two), or go to the mall, or be the flamboyant homosexual I am. All my clothes would smell like smoke, and so then my room would have the smell for a week, and then school would be starting. I'll probably end up going anyways because it's the brotherly thing to do and I don't want to be a bitch, but there are those negatives. I'll mull it over, but now I need to rip some CDs into iTunes and get some sleep.

      From CNN.com:  urlLink CNN.com - Yahoo e-mail battles�Google's Gmail .  I've heard of Google's Gmail but never used it. I do, however, have a Yahoo account that I use from my Home page as well as Yahoo! Messenger and e-mail. I was quite excited to see that they offer much more space now, more than I've had on any e-mail account I've ever had, even when I was paying for it. In addition to the 100MB of storage, the interface is cleaned up, and I can now send messages up to 10MB. Looks like I've got a new personal e-mail address, a good thing because the move will make my Charter one unusable. I'll probably get an e-mail through SBC DSL just so the family, teachers, and College Board/Colleges have an e-mail address that doesn't proudly use the word "homo". It just isn't very profesional.  Oh, and by the way, if you haven't tried it, the Blogger "BlogThis!" bookmark thingy is very cool. I used it for this. With blogging this easy I'll be doing it day and night, not that I don't now. If you'll excuse me I've got  Blow This! ,  Queer Eye , and  Sex and the City  to watch. Bye now!

      Howdy all. Not much new to report in my life. I've got a physical in the morning, and an optometrist appointment Thursday for my new glasses. I'm thinking something along the same basic size, maybe more of a rim. I was looking at some Armani the other day at Lenscrafters, so I'll see how Mom reacts to designer eyewear. I am a label queen after all. Lets see, it (was) the first full day of my new "I'm going to get my sorry ass in shape" plan and I've kinda broken. Had pizza (from Papa John's no less) for lunch and Bob Evan's for dinner, complete with Peanut Butter Cup Sunday. So I should really walk for close to 2 hours this evening to make up for it, or maybe noon-time and evening if it isn't too hot.  I've got some links for y'all. Check out the most recent issue of  urlLink  Chicago  magazine  for the Top 20 Singles list. A blog acquaintance of mine,  urlLink Jake S. , made the list as one of two openly gay singles in Chicago. Much congrats to Jake for that.  From another blog I read,  urlLink Andy Towle  provides  urlLink this link  that I found particularly hilarious. Also from Andy, some pics of  urlLink Heath Ledger  from the set of  Brokeback Mountain . That's all for now. Keep busy people. Boredom leads to a backyard performance of  West Side Story , or is that just me?

      Madonna knew what she was talking about. Today everything is about image and the outward impression you make on others. From a young age we buy into advertising and media image and society's perfect example of what you should be. Movies and television do the same. Now I've been cynical of this in the past and said that people worry too much about their image and that it doesn't matter, but I have come to the realization that if you're unhappy with who you are, you can do something about it.  And that's just what I'm going to do. I don't feel like I've got the right image for my personality. No, I'm not going to become a woman. Don't worry. But I am doing everything I can to become who I want to be (within reason, of course). The way I see it, I'll be much more happy if I look the way I want, and I'll have more confidence in everyday life. I don't want to be the new kid, the new senior, and the overweight fag next year. A simple "fuck what they say" attitude won't do it. If I'm going to realize my broadcast journalism career I need to be confident. If I'm going to do what I've always wanted and so musical theatre I need to look and feel like I belong up on stage dancing around and having a fabulous time.  So I've got a plan. It's going to take effort on my part, and some definite training to avoid those foods I eat to often. I actually prefer water and Diet Coke anyways, so that's going to be easy. I'm getting out and walking/jogging/running at least once a day for 50-60 minutes, and I'm going to do whatever else I can to take care of what I need to do. Once I do, I'll be so much more fabulous and so much more myself than I am now. Sure, I'll be a lot more gay looking, but that's who I am and want to be. I don't give a damn what anyone else thinks because I'm damn proud of who I am and will be.

I need to change my question. On looking, I've got 346 views (of my profile) already, and I've only been using Blogger since May 2004 (that's two months for the math-impaired). Cool stuff.

      Today was good overall. Woke up, went to First Watch for breakfast/brunch/lunch, saw  The Stepford Wives  and  Raising Hellen , and went to the mall. Not my usual "I went to the mall today!" trip to the mall. I was with my little brother Josh, and my mother. So I couldn't wander around like I normally do and look for cute boys. But that's for the better anyways (see next post). We went to Lenscrafters because Mom needs new glasses and an eye exam, and so do I. So she was looking for some, and found some cute frames. I just looked, but didn't try anything on. She was to busy to give me an opinion on what I liked, and they sales guy had an annoying vibe about him. Not cute either. I think I saw some I like, but I'm probably going to wait until after the move just because that's probably when Mom will calm down enough to schedule an exam. She's talking about getting them Tuesday after I have a fucking physical at 8:30 in the morning. A physical, that I don't even see the point in, except for God knows Kansas will want one and  another  damn TB test, just like WV wanted. Like I'm going to contract TB between states. Anyways, she wants to look at Sam's Club for glasses too. I'm all for Sam's Club, but for glasses? Unless they have some amazingly cute ones, don't count on it Mom. I saw some I liked at the mall, and they were Armani, so that's what I want.  Going away from that long tangent, the movies were good.  The Stepford Wives  was good, and the acting was delivered by big stars (Matt Broderick, Nicole Kidman, Glenn Close, Miss M) who gave good performances. It was a little far-fetched, and the suspense didn't actually happen until the last 20 minutes, but it was good nonetheless.  Raising Hellen  was great. I love Kate Hudson and Joan Cusack anyways, so I'm a little biased. It was one of those movies that you either cry in or get teary. I was the latter, Mom the former. Anyways Josh is being annoying again and actually is forcing me off the computer at, lets see, 12 in the morning.

           Like the other musicals on Broadway this year, this one is amazing. Like the other musicals on Broadway this year, I haven't seen it. But I've seen two numbers performed offstage ( When I Get My Name In Lights  during the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade and  Not the Boy Next Door  on the Tony's), and I've got the soundtrack. Hugh Jackman plays an impressive Peter Allen and pulls off the production very well. Unlike his London performance of  Oklahoma! , he feels natural in this role. Using even more talent, he plays a surpassingly believable (and cute) gay man in the show.

      ... but is it really? I've got nothing interesting that has to be blogged about right-this-second, so one could say life is boring. But it isn't. It's a little dull, but not boring. School's over and done, so that's a plus. I'm going to miss some people, going to be glad to escape others, and probably never going to talk to any of them ever again. That's just the way life works. People move away, or change e-mails, or change and never talk to you again. Say what you will, it always happens.  Other news includes the 10 day celebration of all things queer here in WVa. I had no idea anything was going on because gay pride stuff is never flamboyant. I only know because Mom grabbed a little booklet at  Chef Dan's  the other night before dinner. Some of the stuff looks cool, and I think I saw a poster in the window of  Ellen's Homemade Ice Cream  for what looks like a drag show. If anyone wants to go I'll try to keep the 19th open on my schedule of moving stuff. It's the night of the 19th at the WVSU Capital Center theatre on Summers Street. Tickets are $10 at the door.  So that's what new, and it isn't about me all that much. I guess being inside and packing and hanging out with the grandparents doesn't make for exciting blog life. But I'm having fun, and that's all that matters, right?

       Ronald Reagan, the cheerful crusader who devoted his presidency to winning the Cold War, trying to scale back government and making people believe it was "morning again in America," died Saturday after a long twilight struggle with Alzheimer's disease, a family friend said. He was 93. He died at his home in California, according to the friend, who spoke on condition of anonymity. (©2004  The Washington Post , via AP)  My thoughts and prayers are with the Reagan family. He was an icon of American history and will be missed.

      This weekend I started watching HBO's  Sex And The City . In just one episode I was hooked. I didn't even start at the beginning: I started with Part 1 of Season 6. If you haven't seen it, do so. The writing is briliant, and the cast is fabulous. My favorite of the fabulous four has to be, hands down, Kim Cattrall. She is just so hilarious as Samantha. But I really can't pick a fav because I love 'em all. Time to find Mom's Season 1 tapes somewhere in the mess of other archaic VHS tapes. DVD is just so much better, but alas, the house only this year jumped into the DVD world.

      Maybe you've heard of  urlLink HR 3313 . Maybe you haven't. Either way, I'm gonna break it down as I see/read it. HR 3313 is a House Resolution, introduced by Rep John N. Hostettler, 8th U.S. Congressional District Indiana on October the 16th, 2003. The resolution as brought to the floor of the House and passed on July 22, 2004 reads, in summary:    Marriage Protection Act of 2004 - Amends the Federal judicial code to deny Federal courts jurisdiction to hear or decide any question pertaining to the interpretation of: (1) the provision of the Defense of Marriage Act that provides that no State shall be required to give effect to any marriage between persons of the same sex under the laws of any other State; or (2) this Act.    Let's see what this means. HR 3313, if passed by the U.S. Senate (it won't), would not allow any Federal court to hear or rule on cases questioning or relating to the legality or interpretation of the  urlLink 1996 Defense of Marriage Act (104th Congress) , as well as question H.R. 3313 if it were to become a law. Essentially, the GOP couldn't get their  urlLink marriage amendment passed (House Joint Resolution 56)  passed at all, so they got scared. If they couldn't make a ban on gay marriage legal in the Constitution, they decided that banning judicial review on the DOMA was a good idea. So they get all of their corrupt conservatives selves together and draft a resolution to prevent courts from saying a ban on gay marriage violates the Constitution. Since they KNOW that restricting judicial jurisdiction is a no-no in America, they want to make sure no court can undo what H.R. 3313 would do. Since when can Congress make a law that defies the 1st and 14th Amendment, as well as common since and equality, and not let a court strike it down because it's unconstitutional? Sometimes the GOP makes me laugh. H.R. 3313 will never make it past the Senate. The House passes stuff all the time that never even makes back-page news. Hell, there's been so many amendments to the Constitution proposed in the house, like flag burning, adding something about motor vehicle infractions, etc.

      I got my car (again) today. It was being kept at my Grandma's in Jefferson City, Missouri while I was in WV. Now that I have a place to park it, it's mine. It's a 1991 Mazda 626 LX (or LE or something), manual transmission, champagne color. I can't find a picture online, leading me to think it's not a 1991 model. Either way, it's a nice car that drives well and has room. Now all I have to do is take my first test at the DMV Wednesday and get my Kansas permit, take Drivers Ed starting mid-August, and have my license in October. It's about damn time!

      Right after I bitched about the College Board not sending my AP Exam results, I get them. I'm very pleased to report that I got a  4  on AP United States History (the only exam I took, so it's good I only got one score). For those who don't know, the AP tests are scored in two parts: 0-5 on the Multiple Choice, and then 0-9 on the Essay Portion. It's I-forget-how-many multiple questions and 3 essays: 1 Document Based Question (DBQ), and 2 Free Response. They take the scores and somehow combine them into a 0-5 score. So I did damn well. According to the stuff on the back, it's the equivalent of getting a "B" in a College-level US History class. Yay for me! Someone please remind me to let Mrs. Heath know.

      I've got a bunch of random thoughts from the past month, but I don't have them in front of me right now. I'll post 'em when I get around to it. Basically anything I thought about on my trip or the move that I remembered I wrote in my paper journal, so I need to weed through it and find things to blog about.  On another note, summer is winding down here. I start school mid-August. It seems really early, but I'll get out earlier in the summer, plus I'm a senior so I'm sure I'm done earlier than the underclassmen. Man it's weird to think about school. I'm off to bed.

      The trip out west was really fun, but I'm glad to be home. Astute and regular readers will notice the new name and address. Sorry I didn't put a notification on the old blog. I forgot. Hehe.  The name, "The Life I Lead", I feel is more mature than my old one. If you care, the title comes from a Billy Joel song entitled  Vienna . The line reads: "...too bad, but it's the life you lead, you're so ahead of yourself that you forgot what you need...". So now you know.

      Well all, I'm off on a vacation of sorts. I'm leaving tomorrow morning for a night in Denver; a night in Vernal, Utah; a few days in Salt Lake City; then back to Vernal for a night; and Denver for a couple days. When I get the chance I'll blog all about it or I'll call when possible. Be good without me everyone!

      They don't work, because they where on my iMac and served that way. I'll get them all working again soon, but until then a Google search should find most of the famous people who's picture won't load.

      Before I leave for Colorado, I told Mom I need some new clothes. So yesterday we went to Old Navy, because I love their stuff and they were having a big sale before all the hot new Fall line comes in. Needless to say, I loaded up, and looks damn fabulous if-I-do-say-so myself. My new expanded wardrobe includes:     urlLink The best jeans I have ever owned ! They're hot and make me look hot.    urlLink Some Cargo pants . They're comfy and cute, so I thought why not. (Mine are in Thatch)    urlLink Pair of Khaki shorts , in Blot.   A button-front shirt I can't seem to find online.   Yet another shirt I can't find online. Both of these "mystery shirts" are cute. I swear.   My favorite purchase of the day:  urlLink my first Messenger Bag ! I've wanted one of these for years, and this one is so fabulous.   Other items: vintage-style "D-ring" belt and a tanktop.    All in all it was a very good shopping trip, and I can now go on a trip and start school with some fabulous new clothes.

      Rather than re-tell the whole story of the move, I thought I would quote what my Mom posted to  urlLink MovingScam.com :   Well, I am MOST distressed to report that my cock-eyed optimism about Graebel has gone down the toilet. To catch newcomers up to date – I used this company for a move last year Chicago area to Charleston, WV and it went FABULOUS – everything professional, organized, and promptly and courteously  handled no matter what came up. This year, I hired them for my move from Charleston to the suburbs of Kansas City. If there could be a larger difference than 180 degrees I would endorse it. From the start it had a bit of a different feel, but the salesman was reassuring that Graebel was a standardized company. From earlier messages, I indicated a bit of a “hard core press” from the salesmen in the Kentucky office, but he answered all of my questions and, again, since the last move was handled so well, I felt confident. Graebel has no office in WV, and on the internet if shows up as services by Pennsylvania or Virginia. I even called the Kansas office to inquire estimates for loads coming back west, but the salesmen from Kentucky said his office “must arrange it, as Charleston is in their area” and he even called the KC office back to cancel my inquiry. I did not get a binding estimate, as I basically had the same stuff I had the year before – both the company and I had all the former paperwork so I felt comfortable. We did paperwork by fax, and I thought all was set.   My moving coordinator was supposed to contact me, but I had to call them to check on things (compare to Chicago move, where I received a welcome letter clearly outlining all the upcoming steps within days). They sent someone out to do an estimate anyway (fine....but they seemed confused that I had paperwork already done....and showed up 3 hours earlier than the appointment time as I was on the way to take my parents back to the airport!). The gentleman that did my estimate was actually one of the two guys who had helped my driver unload me the year before, he was very nice and told me he’d likely be helping this time as well. He apologized for the office mix-up on my paperwork/arrangements with the estimate. I called the salesmen to inquire about the estimate and any changes as a result, and he said an in-home estimate wasn’t needed, that was a mistake but no problem, they just had some “miscommunication in the office.” (TIP OF THE ICEBERG).  I still have not heard from the company 5 days before my load date, I call to make sure it is on the books – it is. My moving coordinator calls 2 days before load date to see if I’m  all set (I self pack everything). Yes, I am, and before she hangs up on me I ask her about my driver name/number. She looks it up. (BTW – this is NOT the name of the guy who shows up Saturday, and is again in contrast to my Chicago move, where the driver contacted me several days before and introduced himself, checked in with me, exchanged info, etc.).  So Saturday June 26 arrives. I and my children have been up a good portion of the night ensuring everything is absolutely ready, and we are waiting by the 7:30-8a.m. Time slot. The driver shows up around 9:15. He is from the Houston office. I inquire about helpers, he says two guys are supposed to be there from the Kentucky office. I call my coordinator and he calls his office. Meanwhile, I live in an urban area near where indigent and addicted people hang out. A moving truck attracts this population (sorry, I am being non-PC here, but it is well known in my neighborhood that these are not people to have around your stuff). So I am waiting amidst calls of “hey girlie, need some help moving? I’ll move stuff for some cash.” etc. etc. I say thanks anyway, but I have hired a company, so please give us some room.  The moving coordinator “doesn’t know what happened, 2 guys where supposed to show up and sometimes this happens”. The driver is blaming the Kentucky office, the Kentucky office is blaming the Houston office. Meanwhile, my driver is loading what he can by himself onto the truck. He wants to hire some of the street people and I say no – that is not what I hired the company for. (Graebel strongly states that they have stringent training and only use professionals on all aspects. The year before, I had a new employee, and he was required to be supervised more closely and my driver informed me he was new, etc.). My move coordinator agreed, and told me to not have the driver hire street help. They were supposedly contacting other companies in the area to get help sent out and hopefully loaded that day. Of note, my coordinator kept saying “I’ll call you right back” but hours would pass, and I finally called HER every time.  I went at 1:00 p.m. To pick up food for my driver. When I returned, he had hired one of the street men, who was in my house jerking down the stairs my boxes of belongings on a dolly (none of the fancy “move 2-3 boxes on your back” moves that I’ve always been in awe of every time I’ve hired professional movers). The driver shrugged and said “I had no choice but to hire someone like that, just keep an eye on your stuff.” The moving coordinator then says she will be leaving at 3:00 P.M, but I should feel free to use the “emergency hotline.”  I was of course by this time very unpleased. She said she totally agreed and confessed that in 20+ years of working in the industry she didn’t know what to do about this move. She advised me that my children and I could help load the truck ourselves, and that they could “pay me”.  I informed her that, given we’d been up with moving activities and the end of school, and had a 14 drive ahead of us, and HIRED movers, this was unacceptable. She agreed and endorsed that she would “advocate for whatever I wanted” and asked me what that would be. I told her I was at a loss, because this was obviously not my area. When I asked her what she recommended she said I should ask for a bigger discount for sure, and reimbursement of anything broken even in those boxes would be reasonable given that my move “broke all the conventions they had guidelines for.” She also reassured me she “sat next to the regional vice president and they would make it right.”  The driver was unfriendly – never said thank you from the food and drinks to the substantial tip as the end. I KNOW this was not his fault, and was not about to take it out on him. I also told the move coordinator that any compensation needed to come from the company and not from the driver’s pay, who was also put in a terrible position. She agreed. I certainly would be in a bad mood in the drivers’ position, but he was a bit extreme. Several times he complained about my furniture (some of it IKEA-type – hey! I’ve been a grad student single parent!) A few pieces – which had been moved with no problems or comments before – he said he’d refuse to move unless I signed a waiver. I told him I had never had to do that before. Some other pieces he started breaking down which had not been taken apart on any previous moves. One he insisted I break it down or he wouldn’t take it. I refused and called the hotline. They kept emphasizing “your driver is a professional” [so not the point) and that it is “driver’s discretion to move pressed wood” (then shouldn’t they send me a driver more comfortable with my furniture type – again this had never come up in past moves). After the hotline call it was not mentioned again, and the driver loaded it. Turns out – he told me that “there might not me enough room in the truck!” This was the big emphasis on breaking things down, besides ease of carrying things with the aid of an untrained helper. I was extremely upset – why send a truck that can’t even fit my things???????  This move took TWELVE hours to load 7500 lbs (my last move took 5). We could not clean out apartment and have the walkthrough that day, and obviously could not leave for KS anyway until the next day as we were so warn out from the dragged out stressful process.  The KS end unload on Tuesday the 29th went better, although there was only 1 helper (thankfully a Graebel employee, though) and it still took longer than my last super-efficient move. I had to sign the paperwork before it was weighed because he hadn’t gotten light weight. My move coordinator said she had to put my charge through since they did it COD, but that she would meet with everyone about my situation. My salesman was out on vacation until the next day.  Over a week passes with no word (contrast last year, both driver, coordinator, and national rep checked in with me after the move). I finally leave moving coordinator a voicemail yesterday. She calls me today, saying they had a “long meeting” with my salesman and the regional VP out of Cincinnati. All they are willing to do is send me a check for $150 since “They did what they said they’d do and got me loaded on that day and I didn’t help with any labor. The coordinater told them she didn’t think I’d be satisfied with that, and they said that’s all they were willing to do. She told me she strongly disagreed with the deccison but “had no power.” She suggested I write to the salemean and the VP and gave me the address.  So essentially – I could have paid a couple hundred to the street people to load a U-Pack thing in Charleston, and had relatives in KS unload me (I DO know people on this end to help). Instead, I’ve paid over $3,000 for the most rude, inefficient, stressful, and unprofessional experience of my life.   Here’s some laughable quotes from their booklet:  “When you put most of your worldly possessions in the hands of a mover, it’s nice to know they 'know how and care’. Graebel has the experience and the commitment to live up to every guarantee. We make lots of friends this way.”  “A team of talented people. - Thousands of dedicated Graebel colleagues join in the pursuit of excellence. Stringent recruitment standards, regular training and constant supervision assure your satisfaction. Greabels’ results-oriented professionals are nationally recognized for pioneering a new kind of competence. We’ve made moving the organized, effortless experience it should have been all along.”  You know – I was a VERY happy customer last year, and I’m not that hard to please. Just a couple of those “thousands” of dedicated employees is all I wanted to show up for my move. I do not feel I got that, and know of no other business where such inadequacy in customer satisfaction is dismissed or forgiven.   So all in all it sucked. Worst move I've ever been through, and probably will ever go through. So now you know the story of how my stuff got to Kansas. I've already covered the drive in an phone post, so I'll be back later to share everything I've done since arriving here in fabulous Kansas.

      Thanks to SBC, my DSL service wasn't ready last week. But it works now, a whole day earlier than planned, so I'm happy. There is  way  too much stuff to talk about now, but I will be telling all of my stories from the move later today and tomorrow.

      I'm aware I don't update this that much anymore. Honestly, nothing is happening in my life. This blog isn't going to go away and die or anything, it's just going to receive less updates until my life gets exciting again. I've got a Xanga journal that's a little more updated as of recent; I don't really know why... several possible reasons.

      Yes, you read right. Bored. That's me. Bored out of my mind. My days consist of random house work, that only takes 30 minutes tops to do. After that I'm laying on the couch watching TV or in my room listening to some musicals or here in front of my computer. How sad is that? I'm sick of it. There's so much I want to be doing but I can't for one reason or another. So here I am rambling on and on about some topic that doesn't make any sense. Hell, I'm only posting to kill time. Why is life so crazy sometimes?

      While I don't particularly care for getting up at 6 AM to go the the Dept. of Motor Vehicles, it wasn't that bad. Lines were short, people were nice. In and out within half an hour. Passed the test, of course, and I have my temporary permit. Yay! Test was easy, but then again the last "big" tests I took were the SAT and the AP US History.

      Great song in general as done by Billy Joel. But you haven't lived until you've heard  urlLink Diana Krall  sing it on her  Live in Paris  album. It's fabulous. I could just listen to it over and over and over. Actually, the song is underused. It should be a slow-dance staple. * imagines slow dance to that song with cute boy * Yes, that would be very romantic.   Don't go changing, to try and please me You never let me down before Don't imagine you're too familiar And I don't see you anymore I wouldn't leave you in times of trouble We never could have come this far I took the good times, I'll take the bad times I'll take you just the way you are  Don't go trying some new fashion Don't change the color of your hair You always have my unspoken passion Although I might not seem to care  I don't want clever conversation I never want to work that hard I just want someone that I can talk to I want you just the way you are  I need to know that you will always be The same old someone that I knew What will it take till you believe in me The way that I believe in you  I said I love you, and that's forever And this I promise from the heart I could not love you any better I love you just the way you are

      No, not the movie. I though I'd use it as a title because today in Missouri and Kansas is the 2004 Primary (GOP, I think, but then again Democrats just don't run in Johnson County, KS). All of you in Kansas and Missouri go out and vote (if you're 18). If  I  was voting, I wouldn't know the candidates. If you're in Missouri, vote  NO  on Amendment 2. If you're in KCM, vote for the arena. Don't let STL have all the tourism.

      My mind is a dangerous place. Nothing is "wrong" with it, I don't have any medical conditions, I just have a lot of stuff floating in my head 24/7. Most of it seems trivial to the outside world, but to me it's important. Sorry this is so vague, but it's one of those things you need to write down but can't really delve upon in a public forum. If you're close to me then you probably know this already or I'll tell you. Otherwise you can pass this over and continue on as planned.   Update, 8/3/04 : I'm good now. I just was having one of those moments when you really don't need people bothering you. Mom came home yesterday afternoon after work and we got into one of those arguments. We've worked things over now, and there is some stuff  I  need to work out, but I'm good. Sometimes you just need to be alone and clear your mind.

      Obviously, today is the first day of August. It's also the official start of Mom's job at the Hoglund Brain Imaging Center at the University of Kansas Medical Center. Her first day present at work for orientation is tomorrow. What that means for me is that she's out of my hair. If I had a life I would go drive and hang out with friends. As it stands I don't have any. Actually I strike that statement. I've been talking to Jason who lives in Liberty, MO but who has a bunch of friends in Overland Park. He's nice, funny, gay, single, and to accurately quote Alycia: "is SO cute". It's good to know people in your area with similar interests who know more people in the area with similar interests. One can never have to many gay or gay-friendly friends. Especially in Kansas City. That's all for now. I'll be back with some pictures from the Colorado/Utah trip later.
