Who made the sun shine through. I know who made the moonshine, too. Back where I come from. Blue eyes on a Saturday night, Tan legs in the broad day light. TV's, they were black and white, Back where I come from.  "Could ya, would ya, ain't ya gonna, if I asked you, "Would ya wanna be my baby tonight? "Yeah, I'd take a chance, slow dance, make a little romance. "Honey, it'll be all right. "Girl, you got me wishin' we were huggin' and a kissin', "And a holdin' each other tight. "So could ya, would ya, ain't ya gonna, if I asked you, "Would ya wanna be my baby tonight?"  "Justice is the one thing you should always find. "You got to saddle up your boys, "You got to draw a hard line. "When the gunsmoke settles, we'll sing a victory tune. "We'll all meet back at the local saloon, "We'll raise up our glasses against evil forces, "Singing: 'Whiskey for my men, beer for my horses.'"  All my thoughts seem to settle on the breeze, When I'm lying wrapped up in your arms. The whole world just fades away, and the only thing I hear, Is the beating of your heart.  Someday, I'm gonna be famous, Do I have talent? Well, no. These days you don't really need it, Thanks to reality shows.  Can't wait to date a supermodel, Can't wait to sue my Dad. Can't wait to wreck a Ferrari, On my way to rehab.  Daddy's belt, Mama's drapes,  Standin' tall on the backyard shed lookin' cool, In my superman cape. I told the neighbourhood girls, said: "Hey y'all, watch this!" My fate was a broken arm and my reward: A one day kiss. When Daddy asked me why I did it I made him laugh out loud when I told him: "Cause the chicks dig it."  Here I sit, a nobody with no-one. An' bein' me ain't really all that fun. Leavin' her wasn't very smart. Admittin' I was wrong wouldn't be so hard.  If it was cool to be a fool, I'd be the hippest guy around. If a heartache made you famous, I'd be known from town to town.  If tears were made of pennies, and a cold beer brought her back,  My bank account and self esteem would both be in the black. An' if some Hollywood producer made a movie that was sad, About some guy who lost the best thing he ever had,  Hey, I could be a star, if it was cool to be a fool.   I take off, time to time, with those crazy friends of mine. Head out on steel horses, with wheels, an' we ride. We burn up that road, to old Mexico. Blend in with the desert; just we amigos and we roll.  Could you cry a little, An' lie just a little? Pretend that you're feeling, A little more pain. I gave, now I'm wanting, Something in return,  So cry just a little for me.  She's got her Daddy's money, her Mama's good looks, More laughs than a stack of comic books. A wild imagination, a college education; Add it all up, it's a deadly combination. She's a good Bass fisher, a dynamite kisser, Country as a turnip green. She's got her Daddy's money, her Mama's good looks, And look who's lookin' at me.  Dance every dance an' live each day, As though it's your last, An' tell those that you love how you feel, Before it's too late. Life is right here and now,  We only go around just one time. So embrace 'em, don't waste 'em, For these are the days of our lives.  Every night, it’s the same, I hear you callin’ my name. You’re lyin’ next to me. I give in to your charms; You disappear in my arms; I realize it’s just a dream,   Hey, two plus two is always four, And down is south and up is north, An' thirty-two degrees is freezing cold. You play with fire you wind up burned. The early-bird gets the worm  You and me going fishing in the dark, Lying on our backs and countin' the stars, Where the cool grass grows.  Down by the river in the full moon light, We'll be fallin' in love in the middle of the night, Just movin' slow.  Stayin' the whole night through, Feels so good to be with you.  Hardly ever been kissed, twenty years of innocence, Just what I'm lookin' for. I wanna be the man that's holdin' her hand, When she can't hold it back any more.  Good little girls make some mighty wild women, Been savin' it up since the very beginnin': When they fall in love, they wanna take it to the limit. Good little girls make some mighty wild women.  She's got an MBA and a plush corner office. She's got a "don't mess with me" attitude. She'll close a deal; she don't reveal that she can feel, The loneliness, the emptiness, 'cept when she comes in here   An' she's the product of the "Me" generation. She's got a rock and roll side when you get her agitated. She got the tattoo there on her derriere from a spring break dare, In Panama where love was all she thought she'd ever need. She yells out to the band: "Know any Bruce Springsteen?" Then she jumps up on the bar and she, and she starts to scream.  Little umbrella shaped margaritas; Coconut oil, tannin' senioritas; Now I know how Jimmy Buffet feels.  I'm not gonna sleep  till I touch your face. Baby, not a wink, I could go for days. If you ever needed to see me down on my knees, Take a look at me: Baby, I can't sleep.  Spent forty-eight dollars last night at the county fair, I throwed out my shoulder, but I won her that teddy bear. She's got me saying "Sugar-pie, honey, darlin', and dear", I ain't seen The Braves play a game all year.  I'm gonna get fired, if I don't get some sleep. My long lost buddies say I'm gettin' in too deep.  "I love you this much and I'm waiting on you, "To make up your mind: do you love me too? "However long it takes, I'm never giving up. "No matter what, I love you this much."  I melt every time you look at me that way. It never fails, anytime, any place. This burnin' me is the coolest thing I've ever felt. I melt.  We talk about you dreams and we talk about your schemes; Your high school team and your moisturiser cream. We talk about your Nanna, up in Muncie, Indiana; We talk about your grandma down in Alabama. We talk about your guys of every shape and size; The ones that you despise and the ones you idolise. We talk about your heart, 'bout your brains and your smarts; And your medical charts and when you start.  Jessie James was an outlaw man, He was always breakin' the law. Six guns firing from both his hands: Fastest you ever saw. Did he do it for the money? Or was it for the fame? Finally, somebody asked him: "Jessie, "Why you wanna rob them trains?"  Why the drama? We don't have to drag out the situation. It wasn't you, it wasn't me; sometimes the chemistry don't ignite. There ain't no rings, no mortgage, there ain't any complications. It's just a hyphenated word, get it out, I'm sure I'll be all right.  Look at me, I’m way past pride. Isn’t there some way that we can try, To be us again. An' even if it takes a while, I’ll wait right here until I see that smile, That says we’re us again.   Well, I'll never forget the first time that I heard, That pretty mouth say that dirty word. An' I can't even remember now, What she backed my truck into. But she covered her mouth and her face got red, And she just looked so darn cute. That I couldn't even act like I was mad. Yeah, I live for little moments like that.   I love to love you out loud.  He's so GQ, he could be gay, His pick up line's borderline lame; But he's a pilot an' that's hot.  Sometimes it feels like this world's spinning faster, Than it did in the old days. So, naturally, we have more natural disasters, From the strain of a fast pace. Sunday was the day of rest; Now its one more day for progress. And we can't slow down, 'cause more is best. It's all an endless process.  When I saw you buying Cosmo and a Hot Rod magazine, I said to myself: "Now there's a girl for me." And when I asked you to go for a ride, You stole my heart when you said: "If I can drive." I said: "How 'bout some music." You said: "You got any Merle?" That's when I knew you were my kind of girl.  I learned how to write it when I first started school. Some bully didn't like it; he said it didn't sound too cool. So I had to hit him, and all I said when the blood came: "It's my last name."   High school yearbook on her lap.  Snapshot faces take her back. Class rings and strings of broken hearts.  A single word of "yes" or "no" could've changed her destiny.   He looked at me with knowing eyes, An' took a canvas from a bag there by his side. Picked up a brush an' said to me: "Son, just where in this picture would you like to be?" Well, I said if there's any way you can, Could you paint me back into her arms again?  Passenger side, I slide on in. Vinyl seats soft from the heat of the sun. Chewin' on a Slim Jim, can't stop thinkin' bout him.  If you don't take me to Paris on a lover's getaway, It's all right, it's all right. If I'd rather wear your T-shirt than a sexy negligee, It's all right, it's all right. Every dinner doesn't have to be candlelit.  In the back of that red rag top, She said: "Please don't stop."   Victoria's Secret", well, their stuff's real nice. Oh, but I can buy the same damn thing, On a Wal-Mart shelf, half price. And still look sexy, (Sexy.) Just as sexy, As those models on TV. No, I don't need no designer tag, To make my men want me. You might think I'm trashy: A little too hard core. But in my neck of the woods, I'm just the girl next door.   Hello God, it's me again. 2:00 a.m., Room 304. Visiting hours are over, time for our bedside tug of war. This sleeping child between us may not make it through the night. I'm fighting back the tears as she fights for her life.   We went flyin' down the interstate, Chasin' those Texas plates. Seventeen, we couldn't wait, To see where the road might lead. Not a care in the whole wide world, Just three Oklahoma girls, Wantin' a piece of the Lone Star state, Chasin' those Texas plates.  She had that Honda loaded down, With Abercrombie clothes, An' and fifteen pairs of shoes, An' his American Express. He checked the oil and slammed the hood, Said: "You're good to go." She hugged them both, An'd headed off to the west coast.  Hey baby, is that you? Wow, your hair got so long! Yeah, yeah, I love it, I really do. Norma Jean ain't song we'd sing in the car driving down town. Top down, makin' the rounds, checkin' out the bands on Doheny Avenue. Yeah, life throws you curves but you learn to swerve. Me, I swung and I missed, and the next thing you know, I'm reminiscing: dreamin' on dreams, wishin' on wishes. Like you would be back again.   It's the way you love me, It's a feeling like this. It's centrifugal motion, It's perpetual bliss. It's that pivotal moment, It's, ah, impossible. This kiss, this kiss. Unstoppable. This kiss, this kiss.  This is for all you girls, about thirteen. High School can be so rough; can be so mean. Hold onto, onto your innocence. Stand your ground, when everybody's givin' in.  This one's for the girls.  Put on my blue suede shoes, an' I boarded the plane. Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues in the middle of a pouring rain. W.C. Handy, won't you look down over me? 'Cause I got a first-class ticket and I'm as blue as a boy can be.  Girl, you know, you told me not so long ago, (Not so long ago.) To let it come, then let it pass. And all your troubles and your sorrows, They won't last.  So let me kiss you now, little darling, Beneath this autumn moon. Cold wind, another season, Will be here soon.  At the other side, she was hollerin': "Faster." Took a dirt road, had the radio blastin'. Hit the honky-tonk for a little close dancin'. What was I thinkin'?  Oh, I knew there'd be hell to pay. But that crossed my mind a little too late.  When the sun goes down, we’ll be groovin'. When the sun goes down, be feeling all right. When the sun sinks down, over the water, She thinks Kracker's sexy when the sun goes down.  Ooh, ooh, ooh, mmmm, We’ll be feeling all right. When the sun sinks down, over the water, Uncle Kenny's hotter when the sun goes down.  Now she's strummin' on my six-string, Across her pretty knees. She's stompin' out a rhythm, An' singin' to me, the sweetest song.  Only forgiveness, Will finally end this. There won't be a witness if we both fall. There's never a hero, In a battle of egos. There's never a winner of the quick draw. Hey yaw, Hey yaw!   Well, at nine a.m., out in front of that church, People goin' nuts looking for the groom. Somebody says: "Hey, by the way, where's Connie?" She's run off with that boy to Cancun.  Someday I'm gonna run across your mind, But don't worry, I'll be fine. I'm gonna be alright. While you're sleeping with your pride, Wishing I could hold you tight, I'll be over you and on with my life.

       Dum de de dum, de de dum, de de dum, de de da da. Dum de de dum, de de dum, de de dum, de da da, la la la.   Well, I walk into the room passin' out hundred dollar bills. An' it kills and it thrills like the horns on my Silverado grille. An' I buy the bar a double round of Crown an' everybody's getting down, An' this town ain't never gonna be the same.   'Cause I saddle up my horse an' I ride into the city. I make a lot of noise 'cause the girls, they are so pretty. Ridin' up an' down Broadway on my old stud, Leroy. And the girls say: "Save a horse, ride a cowboy." Everybody says: "Save a horse, ride a cowboy."   Well, I don't give a dang about nothing: I'm singing an' bling-blanging, While the girls are drinkin' long necks down! An' I wouldn't trade ol' Leroy or my Chevrolet for your Escalade, or your freak parade: I'm the only John Wayne left in this town.   An' I saddle up my horse an' I ride into the city. I make a lot of noise 'cause the girls, they are so pretty. Ridin' up an' down Broadway on my old stud, Leroy. And the girls say: "Save a horse, ride a cowboy." Everybody says: "Save a horse, ride a cowboy."   Instrumental break.   "Well, I'm a thoroughbred." That's what she said in the back of my truck bed, As I was gettin' buzzed on suds, out on some back country road. We where flyin' high, fine as wine, Having ourselves a Big and Rich time An' I was going, just about as far as she'd let me go. But her evaluation of my cowboy reputation Had me beggin' for salvation all night long. So I took her out, gigging frogs, Introduced her to my old bird dog An' sang her every Wilie Nelson song I could think of. An' we made love.   An' I saddle up my horse an' I ride into the city. I make a lot of noise 'cause the girls, they are so pretty. Ridin' up an' down Broadway on my old stud, Leroy. And the girls say: "Save a horse, ride a cowboy." Everybody says: "Save a horse, ride a cowboy."   What? What? "Save a horse, ride a cowboy." Everybody says: "Save a horse, ride a cowboy."

       Ploughing these fields in the hot summer sun. An' over by the gate, Lordy, here she comes. With a basket full of chicken, and a big cold jug of sweet tea. I make a little room and she climbs on up. Open up the throttle and stir a little dust. Just look at her face, she ain't a'foolin' me.   She thinks my tractors sexy,  it really turns her on. She's always staring at me, while I'm chugging along. She likes the way it's pulling while we're tilling up the land. She's even kinda crazy, 'bout my farmers tan. She's the only one who really understands what gets me. She thinks my tractors sexy. She thinks my tractors sexy.   We go back and forth till we run out of light, Take it to the barn, put it up for the night. Climb up in the loft, sit and talk with the radio on. She says she's got a dream and I ask what it is. She wants a little farm and a yard full of kids. Then one more teeny, weenie ride before I take her home.   She thinks my tractors sexy,  it really turns her on. She's always staring at me, while I'm chugging along. She likes the way it's pulling while we're tilling up the land. She's even kinda crazy, 'bout my farmers tan. She's the only one who really understands what gets me. She thinks my tractors sexy. She thinks my tractors sexy.   Well she ain't into cars or pick-up trucks, But if it runs like a Deere, man her eyes light up. She thinks my tractors......   She thinks my tractors sexy,  it really turns her on. She's always staring at me, while I'm chugging along. She likes the way it's pulling while we're tilling up the land. She's even kinda crazy, 'bout my farmers tan. She's the only one who really understands what gets me. She thinks my tractors sexy. She thinks my tractors sexy.   She thinks my tractors sexy.
