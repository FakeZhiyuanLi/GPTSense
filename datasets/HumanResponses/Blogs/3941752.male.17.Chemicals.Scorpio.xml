						   Well, well, what am I doing now...This is weird, very very weird. Mr Handoko was never the type who wrote journals, diaries or whatsoever. Perhaps...this is a change after all. Just like what a friend has mentioned before in his e-mail message to me, where he posted his essay topic entitled: Change is itself a constant. I'll talk more about that later. Anyway, as I began reading his e-mail message, a long recollection of my past began to materialize within the hollow(I hadn't been using my brains all this while, so sad) chambers of my small yet too imaginative mind(as I have always been). The past about how I found myself a second homeland, yet this homeland was in fact... better.     Fate has led me to become what I truly were, and what I truly am right now. Although I have always hated Fate(or a less solemn word, Destiny), I realize that I have to appreciate what little or much it has done to me for the very least. The reason is Fate(as I now believe), is the only element that made me experience the horrors and joy of life, and most importantly, the ultimate wisdom. This is after all the hard-earned wisdom, at the price of the pain and humiliation we suffered in the course of life.      What about this change you were talking about in the beginning? Ah, yes. Wisdom is I have said, is an indicator of our change, in terms of spirituality and mentality. The same theory applies here. Humans are born to be selfish in different degrees, and we are always thinking for ourselves. This friend that sent me the essay topic, I really must thank him for letting me realize something about change. Although, honestly, I have never once felt it before, this sense of respect and friendship suddenly radiates a glow of light within my soul that I have never once tasted so vividly before. That is change. In the end, it gave me another piece of wisdom, an advice: Value your friends as you value yourself.     That I know.     http://www.wisdomroad.com/display/1570-364.jpg

						   I gazed upon the interface of my digital watch, and soon my senses came alive to realize that it has indeed been a more than a week since I last posted my opening message on Wisdom. Anyway, this week has been stressful for me, especially from Monday through Wednesday, for they each witnessed the rare moments of diligence in my life as I prepared myself for the battle on Thursday---Chemitry Midterm Exam on Entropy, Free Energy, electrochemistry and complex transition compounds. I must confess that wrestling with the obscure concepts of Chemistry has been challenging, and it just made me happier on thursday as I instantly knew my grade for the chemistry exam to be 90%---barely an A, was I happy. But wait a minute!  "For Christ's Sake, don't get complaisant! Your Finals are next week! Damn it!"  As a matter of fact, they are.  I planned that I was going to revise all my Chemistry concepts this weekend. I planned that I will prepare myself well for this final battle. Too bad, Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II caught my attention and I half-consciously felt my hands reaching out for the joystick. Ten seconds later, I was vigorously punching the buttons. Forgot about chemistry I did. Forgot about Calculus I did.  Holy Lord! Lead me away from temptation!
