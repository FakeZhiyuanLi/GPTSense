      I'm going to be quick with this post...10 minutes before the bus comes. I'm surprised; I finished my work before the bus came. OK, I  almost  finished...I still have Nick Adams to read on the bus. Today is the school picnic which means shortened classes and all. I wonder how the picnic is going to go this year... OK, 5 minutes left... It's a 3-day weekend with the Bake Sale with Kathy, Zack, and Aneleise on Saturday and the Isle of Shoals field trip on Tuesday(OK, make that a 4-day weekend). OK, bus is gonna come any second now...have to go...

      Got to school, walked around with Kathy and Aneleise at the beginning of the day. Went to English next where we discussed some grammar and Hemingway. I think I will like reading the Hemingway stuff. All of his writing is direct...straight to the point with no gimmicks and I don't have be a literary genius to know what I am reading. Got some grammar and reading for homework.  Sophomores had student government speeches so I escaped the wrath of Prob &amp; Stats...for 45 minutes anyway. Student Council members all ran un-opposed so needless to say they've already won. Zack ran for Student Council Vice-President("regime"...LOL), Kathy for Junior Class Secretary("I'm going to crack down..."; druggies: Crack? Where!; haha), and Aneleise for Junior Class Treasurer(two opponents). The rest of math we worked on homework.  Latin was well...digressive. We were talking about Perseus and how an oracle told Acrisius(Perseus' grandfather) that he would be killed by his grandson. I asked whether or not an oracle has ever been proved wrong. By saying that, I threw the class into a heated debate on philosophy. Here's a brief outline of the discussion: Oracle --> predestination/fate --> Is there choice? --> Will we ever know? --> Is there a point in knowing? --> Why do we have to ask why? --> Science VS Religion/Philosophy. The conversation lasted around 50 minutes...ooo I'm good at making the class digress..hehe. In the end we finished correcting our translation homework but we didn't have time for participles. We got the next translation for homework.  I'll describe Gym class in one sentence; we played basketball.  During lunch, Zack, Kathy, and I "collaborated" again on the APUSH stuff...  In APUSH, MacDonald lectured on the 3-4 Industrial Revolutions and the various requirements for an Industrial Revolution. It was interesting but the only thing that is driving me nuts is the exam and journal evaluation on Thursday...:-(.

      Today was a bit more exciting than my regular days. In English, we finished watching Gatsby, outlined Ernest Hemingway's biography, and got a new book written by him to read for tonight. Ford wasn't here today; no idea where he went.  In Prob &amp; Stats we had a test on normal distribution, Z-scores, standard deviation,yadda yadda yadda. It was pretty easy I might add. Good news is that we got homework but it's due Wednesday. The bad news is that we got ANOTHER textbook. Personally, I think my bag is full and heavy enough already thank you very much. Did I mention we're getting Latin books as well tomorrow?  In Latin we looked over our quiz from Friday...97%, w00t. We read some Perseus and got some translation to do for homework. It should be quick.  Gym was okay I guess. It was raining earlier in the day so we didn't do archery. The class decided to play basketball...or shall I say knockout. I think I actually won in a few of the rounds.  Lunch was nonchalant as usual. I rarely talk...I rarely ever talk...I should try and change that. Besides that I checked out the book fair with Zack and Aneleise, but Kathy wouldn't come along :P. Didn't buy any books though.  In APUSH, we took notes the entire block on the treaties made in the 1800s by the USA and how we stole..*cough*..acquired lands from the other countries. Somehow I think I like listening to the lectures. This ironically, only applies to History classes and maybe Science. I think this is because lectures in all of the other subjects are just so boring...Math you have numbers...English you have writing and more writing. We didn't actually get any ACTUAL homework though...I'll get to that...   Afterschool, Zack, Kathy, me and a few others went to the library to "collaborate" on the APUSH stuff due Thursday and might I add it's quite a list... Afterwards, Nick drove Kathy and I home. On the way, Nick had an...interesting CD playing...the Internet(and its uses), racism, etc. Nick is just like that; he's not afraid like most people of confronting those "controversial" topics head-first and taking a side. Don't get me wrong, I think it's perfectly fine to do that; I'm just pointing out most people lack the audacity to do it. Anyways the library and the trip made my day that much better...we should do it again.

      What did I do this weekend? Not much really. My uncle was telling me that his computer was being "slow" and takes too long to boot up. There's about a million things that can make your computer slow so I decided to start from scratch. Besides, his computer is archaic...a AMD K6 450 MHz, 128MB of something resembling SDRAM, 10GB hard drive,...need I continue? I managed to obtain a copy of Windows XP Pro (his copy of Windows XP Home from Dell didn't work), re-format his hard drive, did a "clean" install of Windows, and installed SP2(RC1).   In other news, I began reading Deception Point by Dan Brown that I got off Barnes and Noble. It's a good read so far...maybe a day or two more to finish it. Did I mention I need to start on my homework? Guess not. Grammar and normal distributions...here I come[sarcasm]...

         In English we watched Gatsby again. We actually got close to finishing it but didn't quite make it. A good chunk of the class went on the Canobie Lake field trip. It was for the Physics and Geometry classes (I got jipped last year cause I was first semester). The movie followed the book decently except for a few parts where they added scenes that wasn't in the book. Besides that we got grammar homework....who cares about run-on sentences anyways?     Prob &amp; Stats was painfully non-exciting as usual. Heath went over the homework and gave  us group work. I think my group bombed it and I was trying to keep my eyelids from drooping shut. Got homework, plus test Monday.  Latin we went over homework and did a quiz...is panis (bread) masculine or feminine? I think I made a few mistakes here and there...negligible. No homework :-).  Gym was ok. We've been doing archery. We taped drawings we made of people and shot at them. I was shooting Peter and he was shooting me. Aren't we nice?     MacDonald wasn't there and we had a substitute even though he was there for the two other classes. We did a reading on the Erie Canal and started Lincoln's Inaugural Address. Hate inaugural addresses...they're so freaking long and half of it is gibberish and we're suppose to "analyze" it...  Personal Reminders: -Bake Sale @ Centennial Hall on Saturday the 29th...bring/bake something??? -Math team party afterschool Wednesday the 26th @ Pizza Hut. -APUSH journal and exam Thursday the 27th...readings, unit outlines, stuff...

      Check the time; I definitely have to stop this. It's almost 6AM and I'm still awake doing work. What have I been doing all this time??? I don't know. Sleeping, walking around, not doing anything. I'm officially defined as being nocturnal. Call my house at 3 in the morning, I'll be the first to pick up the phone. Hate this.

      We had a two hour delay today. Managed to get some extra sleep at the expense of some work....bell curves and gerunds/gerundives/passive periphrastics....blah blah blah, whatever. I don't care. Sanity has escaped me at the moment.

      This is my first post on Blogger. I initially signed up for this to see if I can get  urlLink GMail  since I heard Google had been allowing some of their Blogger users to start signing up for GMail accounts. But alas, it did not work. It would be such a waste to not use this now since I have already signed up, and so, welcome to my brand new blog, Mechanical Penciler v0.1.

      Well, a past midnight post; it just goes to show you how my schedule[if I can call it that] is really messed up. Today[technically yesterday] I went to the mall and saw Shrek 2 with Zack and Nick.   We originally planned to watch Fahrenheit 9/11 at Hoyts Portsmouth, but the movie/ documentary  was rated R. Too bad none of us were 17, or else we could have went in. So after that we decided to go to the Newington theater to see what was playing there. We decided upon Shrek 2 albeit Nick saw it already. We decided on the 4:40PM showing, but it was only 3:30 when we arrived there. Meanwhile, we went to the mall and into Fye and the bookstore.   Shrek 2 was good and funny. Cartoons can make good movies even though all you see/hear of the "actors/actresses" are their voices. Afterwards, we went to McDonalds so I could pick up some food for Armond and myself since nobody else was home.

      Since I am posting at 3AM, today is officially Friday. This means the first week of summer has ended. What have I done with it?  I managed to: -Install Fedora Core 2[a Linux distribution] and supposedly experience "dependency hell". -Work at the beach[which you know I hate]. -Have free time for fragging purposes. -Replace Outlook Express with Mozilla Thunderbird 0.7 via Web2Pop.  I haven't been posting as frequently lately, but I promise a more interesting post soon. Perhaps I will include some pictures and such. Any ideas[reasonable ones please, Mr. XQ]?

      I wrote this story for my American Literature H final exam. It was suppose to imitate the writing style of F. Scott Fitzgerald.   The Press Release of America   If all the memories of my father’s teachings were to be forgotten, vanished from the face of existence, there is one thing I could not fail to remember. I asked him for a method in which I could use to judge myself; a method when applied could determine whether one’s action is respectable or dishonorable. 	 “In judging ones self, there not a better method than questioning whether or not you are willing to reveal it to the people. Respectable actions require no vale of concealment while dishonorable ones inevitably do." 	 This was told to me when I was a young boy and from time to time in my life, it seems to me that I have used it many times. However, the recipients of this piece of advice were always people other than myself, and because of this, I have always deducted that the reason it was never applied to myself was that my methods of attaining status and wealth were belonging to the category of respectable and clean. This held true until the period of my life where I met John Rockerbuilt.  The only reason I met him was that I had become jobless and unemployed. The Rockerbuilt Corporation was a giant, and oftentimes the title of corporation seemed almost an understatement in describing its wealth and power. The corporation’s headquarters sat appropriately among the powerhouse of New York City, the stock exchange. The building itself was a towering giant and when I stepped through its doors, the lavish interior engulfed me. As I was approaching the front desk, my eyes were elsewhere, perhaps at the magnificent statues, fountains, and other relics that I could not afford if all my life’s earnings were put into it. 	 My amazement at my lavish surroundings was interrupted by a sudden shattering sound. My wandering eyes had caused me to crash into a man, making him drop a sealed container. I immediately insisted he helping him, but I could not do so; the man grabbed his belongings and dashed out of the building. Being the curious person that I was, I was ready to pursue him to find out the source of the problem. As I was about to follow the man an arm grabbed my own with just enough force to stop me. I turned around to see a man with a shirt and tie. The man was perhaps several years older than I was, and he was quick to explain his action. 	 “That man you were about to follow works with me,” he said. “I’m sorry. I did not realize ---,” I tried to reply. “Don’t worry about it old sport. You are…” “George Carr,” I told him. “Nice meeting you old sport, how about coming to my office?” he asked. “I don’t think ---.” “Nonsense,” he replied and beckoned me to follow him. 	 He brought me up to his office, and again I was dazzled at the even more lavish decorations and ornaments. The man apparently sensed my excitement and was quick to reach his point.  	 “My name is John Rockerbuilt and I would like to offer you a job.” 	 For a moment, I was stunned by his identity and sudden offer, being an opportunist however; I immediately tried to regain my composure.  	 “Why yes…I was just looking for a job, but what kind of job,” I asked. 	 Thus, my business plan came to the beginning of its ephemeral life. Within a week’s time, I was driving in the corporation’s Rolls Royce down the bumpy roads to one of Rockerbuilt’s drug stores. I had no passenger, for the occasional swoosh and sloshing sounds would have given the reason for my long journey away. Be known only to myself, the bottom of the Rolls Royce was a tank very much resembling to gas tank next to it. However, the contents of that second tank were many times more valuable than the gasoline fueling the machine I was driving. I did this on a weekly basis, and needless to say, my salary was a very handsome one. 	 After the many trips, my conscience began to go against myself. Sometimes my thoughts would be interrupted by a single question. 	 “Had I done anything dishonorable?” I oftentimes would think.  Many times over I had to convince myself that the salary I made was a fair and honest one and that there was nothing of dishonor in it. 	 This should have been the time where I would listen to my conscience. I did not. Every morning when I woke up, I told myself it was honest money, honest money… As fate would have it, if I were to try to ignore it, the incident would instead be forced upon me. I had taken so many trips and driven so many times the action of doing so was almost instinctual. However, what was about to happen was not in my daily routine and it would later prove that whatever was not instinctual, would be a disaster.  	 I was driving along the long seemingly endless road with the occasional sloshing of the liquid contents beneath me. Without warning, I heard a noise that broke the monotony of the sloshing sound. This new sound was loud and blaring. I looked into my rear mirror, and much to my horror, a police car was behind mine. I suddenly drew up in my mind of all the actions I could take. My outfitted Rolls Royce had a small lever under the driver’s seat. A lever, which, when pulled would release all the contents beneath me onto the road. I pulled the lever. 	 I heard a click and then a jamming noise, a noise that I knew would be the end of me. I found myself driving back to New York City, back to Rockerbuilt’s office. The second tank underneath the car had been removed, and as if the officer knew of my ultimate fate, he allowed me to drive away with him in possession of the tank of alcohol. When I arrived at Rockerbuilt’s headquarters, a crowd of reporters and people had surrounded the entrance. However, I found it unusual that they all were in a shape resembling a semi-circle and instead of looking up; they were looking down at something on the ground.  I pushed my way through the mob and I clearly was not ready for what I was about to witness. 	 Laid in the center of the crowd was the disfigured body of my employer, John Rockerbuilt. The body itself had in a way exploded as it made contact with the ground and had almost burst open similar to that of a balloon. Blood and flesh was everywhere, but the reporters seemed to show nothing. They were busily taking notes and taking pictures. They gazed at the body with no feeling of remorse or pity, and were only excited on the fact that they will perhaps get a raise or promotion for getting this story. As I eyed them in disgust, I had apparently forgotten that I was not so different from them. 	 Weeks later, I had inherited all of John Rockerbuilt’s vast riches. I had done so for in his will, he named me as his sole heir. Apparently, before John Rockerbuilt decided to jump from his window, he managed to pay the officer that pulled me over enough that he would never speak of the incident again. Exactly why my employer decided to commit suicide I perhaps would never know. I now sit in my chair in the lavish office of my former employer with all the lavish and golden decorations with once I had been bedazzled. I was not happy. For weeks, I questioned why I was not happy, and after much thought, I arrived at my conclusion. The answer laid in what I vowed never to forget from my father. 	 “In judging ones self, there not a better method than questioning whether or not you are willing to reveal it to the people. Respectable actions require no vale of concealment while dishonorable ones inevitably do." “Was my actions dishonorable?” “Do I require a vale of concealment to protect myself?”  This is why I am writing this story. I decided to write a press release telling of this story.   Am willingly releasing this information?  I do not think I am, but nonetheless I am doing so.  Are my actions in need of concealment?  Most definitely it is.   My actions for obtaining wealth were definitely dishonorable. This is the press release about me, as well as that of America, that land of opportunities.

      Well, today is the second to the last day of classes. I'll start off with how I got on the bus... The only people that were home in the morning was my mom, brother, two sisters, and me. Usually, I leave through the front door and someone closes it for me. Reason being, the door will not close from the outside and someone always has to close it from the inside. So this morning, my mom felt lazy and didn't want to close it so I had to get the remote garage opener instead. So I was standing there at the bus stop and the bus comes. I turn around and press the remote, nothing happened. The door would not close and long story made short, my garage was open for anyone to get in for the majority of the morning.  I got to school and sat/walked with Kathy and Aneleise until they decided to ditch[OK, maybe I'm exaggerating this] me on the way to English. In English we went over our grammar stuff and decided to have another party[I think it's for somebody's birthday or just for end-of-the-year] tommorrow. This will probably me our 3rd or 4th party to date. Got grammar homework.  Prob &amp; Stat was nonchalant as usual. Peter and I talked before class during the break.   Me:  She[Heath] criticizes you so much when you ask her questions and so everyone is afraid to ask her any questions.  Peter:  You should really tell her that! Really, I'll pay you $10 if you would tell her that.  Other than that we went over reflecting graphs of functions as well as "even" and "odd" functions. Got homework.  In Latin we went over our homework, reviewed for most of class, and took our Perseus quiz. We got this mock-exam she gave last year which we have to do for homework. I swear I'll be so happy when I won't have to see any Latin for the next two or three months...  Gym was a joke. We cleaned out our lockers and gave Foote the locks albeit I didn't have one. I wasn't at school the first day of trimester three and so I didn't get a lock, less a locker. After he finished that we did absolutely nothing and proceeded to sit or do whatever we wanted for the next 40 minutes.  Lunch was the usual, which meant I didn't talk much and I listened most of the time. Personal note: I should talk and "socialize" more during lunch...  In APUSH, we continued the video from Friday about the Civil War with all the "cheesy" effects. For all practical purposes, that's all we did.

      It's hard to believe but another year of high school has come and gone. I can still remember everything, and it's hard to believe that next year we're all going to be juniors. It only seemed like yesterday I was coming in as a freshman.   Summer is coming fast and I'm not sure I will like it all that much [call me weirdo...I don't care...]. It's not that I like school; it's just because I probably won't get to see so many people over the summer until junior year rolls around in September. Does this mean I actually going to care and miss the people around me now? Wow, I've come a long way...   I probably will be working most of the summer and I will undoubtedly hate it. Something I will probably get to do this summer is get some more hours driving around before I actually decide to take driver's education. Other than that I really don't know what to say...

      Saturday I went over to Zack's house to setup the Cantenna but we lost time when we went to see Harry Potter 3 with Nick and Kate.  When we were driving to Zack's house I had NetStumbler on and I found around 8-10 wireless networks. All of them were not protected except for maybe two. All the others were un-encrypted. Before we could do anything else we decided to go watch Harry Potter 3 with Nick and Kate.  Harry Potter 3 was fairly good but like all the Harry Potter movies it was very long and my sitting so long in the seat was a pain [literally]. All the characters got older and Harry now has a more "dark" theme shall I say. Afterwards we went to Friendly's to eat.

      They say a picture is worth a thousand words so I will let this be a 10,000+ word post. The pictures are from the the so called Isle of Shoals field trip but in reality we decided to go fishing instead because it was too rough out in the Shoals. This trip was rescheduled to Wednesday from Tuesday's cancellation...    We were boarding the ship and Zack was to my right.    Near the front of the ship.    Zack...again.    Mallory holding the bar. The boat at the time was going up, down, up, down,...you get the idea...    Inside the cabin.    Zack was waking up.    Me.    Amy, Nick, and Jenna were feeling queasy.    People fishing on the side of the boat.    It's hard to see but Miles was braiding his hair...

      The Isle of Shoals field trip got cancelled, but I did promise pictures. Therefore, Zack and I snapped a few...ok several pictures during lunch. I don't like taking pictures of myself...I always look funny...    Doritos Chips and Apple Juice.    I was looking at the camera, I swear...    Kathy.    Zack.    Zack and Kathy. Kathy looks creepy in this one...    Kathy and I [self-portrait].    Kathy and I [self-portrait] again.

      This weekend was exciting...I got to drive, but first I'll talk about the Bake Sale first.  All in all, it was fun. I showed up around 7:50AM. Centennial Hall was cold and the wind didn't help. We sold cookies, cupcakes, and such to around 1PM when we then got hot dogs and a burger[yes, I chose burger] and ate at Kathy's house. I originally planned to bring my camera and snap a few photos so I could post them here on the blog but I never got around to using it. I got home[Zack drove] and I finished  Deception Point , overall it was a very good book and I would highly recommend it. That was Saturday.   Sunday I had to work at the beach from 11AM to 1AM. I'm not saying why, but I always hated working down there. That didn't ruin my day however, because I got to drive for the first time. I asked my dad to let me drive in the Shaw's parking lot when we closed but he decided to let me drive home instead. He stopped the car halfway to North Beach and told me to get in and drive home. I was tense at first, and I pushed on the gas a little too hard a few times. I drove down towards Atlantic Avenue[almost hit a cat here], stopped at the light, crossed Route 1, passed Centennial Hall and KS' house, turned left into Winnicut, made several loops[almost turned  another  cat into roadkill] around Winnicut Woods, and went home. The biggest problem that night was turning around corners; I would slow, turn, but I would then stop totally before I hit the gas again.  Today wasn't very exciting besides the fact I got to drive at around midnight again. I drove down to the restaurant, made around 7 right turns around the parking lot, 7 left turns, then down Post Road, turned into some small road[I forget which one], made 5 turns in there, down Post Road again, turned left into Winnicut, turned right into some housing complex[again, I forget the name], turn back into Winnicut Woods, made a few turns, and went home. I think I got turning down, just have to work on it some more. Tomorrow is the field trip which means no homework until Tuesday night :-D. I really want to try and add some photos to this blog. So with that said, I'm bringing my digicam tomorrow...errr...today[it's past midnight] so I can get some pictures on the field trip to the Isle of Shoals.

      I was checking my e-mail and I got one claiming to be from US Bank. It asked me to update my account information by clicking on the link in the e-mail or else my account would be deleted. Already chuckling to myself, I clicked on the link. Too bad I was using Firefox, the url showed up as it should, and wasn't masked by a fake one. Another problem was that I was not an US Bank customer in the first place, and I wouldn't have any account and password information to give anyways. I've included a screenshot below for your viewing pleasure.   urlLink    A screenshot of the e-mail.

      I had a great time today[yesterday if you want to be technical] with Kathy, Zack, and Aneleise. We went to eat at  urlLink Margaritas  in Portsmouth. Zack and I arrived first and we parked in front of Bowl-O-Rama, but we couldn't find Kathy or Aneleise yet. We waited outside for around 10 minutes for them, but when they didn't come, we decided to get seats inside to wait. 3 minutes later they showed up inside, albeit I didn't see them until they sat down[my seat was facing away from the door]. Kathy got a steak and chicken fajita combo[let me tell you, she can eat...], Zack got some sort of taco salad, Aneleise some sort of quesadilla, and I got a spicy Picante Chicken dish. Afterwards, Kathy insisted[as in snatching away my wallet] that they will pay the bill since she forgot my birthday. As a side note, Aneleise's birthday is Monday, and Zack's mom's birthday is Sunday.  We had to stop by  urlLink Pier 1 Imports  for Zack to pick up some gift certificates. Afterwards, we went bowling at Bowl-O-Rama. We bowled 3 games, and our respective names on the scoreboard were Eddy[me], Annie[Aneleise], Zack, and Kathy. I won all 3 games, although I will not mention the consequences of doing so...  The last stop was at Kathy's house. We took two cars to get there; I was in Zack's car, and Kathy's mom drove Kathy and Aneleise. We went inside and I was surprised to find a cake for Aneleise and me. Kathy brought both of us gifts for my belated birthday, and Aneleise's early one. I will abstain from discussing the details concerning the nature of these "gifts" ;-). Aneleise got all sorts of "necessities" in preparation for getting her car and license. We played with some sparklers outside at the expense of some drops of blood. Ironically, we were discussing blood types for one reason or another before we went out. The mosquitoes must have overheard our little conversation, and hence I became the main course if you know what I mean. Besides that, today was all in all...great.
