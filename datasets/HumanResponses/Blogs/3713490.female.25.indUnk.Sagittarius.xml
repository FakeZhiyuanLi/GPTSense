      hmm... i hope this works. i thought the invitation was spam at first...  i got a parking ticket at Western because i'm a student and i used a parking meter. Not because the meter ran out (because it still had 15 minutes on it), mind you, but because the nice parking services person was bored enough to run my license plate (the one i bought 2 weeks ago) through the computer and deduce that i was a student. So, i had to pay $25 plus the $2 i payed for the meter.  Now, the really fun part is that last week i parked my dad's car in a spot reserved for people with stickers (something his car does not have, but i accepted the fact that i would probably get caught) and i got a ticket for $15.  $15 for knowingly parking where i shouldn't, $27 for paying a meter.  i love western.
