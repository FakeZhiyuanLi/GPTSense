      Well, I just came back inside after a little "solicitation" ;P. Okay, pssst, it's a  urlLink secret,   okies? Good, good. Okies, let's see...  Well, I've been feeling very isolated b/c of the whole summer at homeness. Chilling is awesome, but I don't feel that I'm getting out enough nor am I sharing  urlLink my greatest joy  with others enough. So, by and for the  glory of God , I made a little flier presenting the gospel along with a good handful of verses from  urlLink Romans  and printed about twenty or so and folded them in a strategic way and dropped 'em in the mailboxes of some neighbors I didn't know. :D And lemme tell ya, what joy! What a rush!  I heard the calling since early this morning. So I wrote the flier and printed one out. And then I ran the idea by my brother who thought that it was  like Gospel Tracks except less hokey . So, YAY! I had a supporter. And support he did; he sat in the front yard and made sure I was safe. That was cool. What He helped use to hit me was a  urlLink Superchic[k]  song,  So Bright (Stand Up) :    you're bored, gotta wonder if there's more waiting for the dreamlife you thought you had in store trying to feel something you can chase a life thats thriller living on the edge drinking, smoking dream killers coulda been shoulda been woulda been, what might your life have been today  you're not a has been but at your life's end  will you have regrets then, have regrets then?  are you ok with today if tomorrow is the end  live today through the future's lens  don't wanna wish you could rewind and play it again   [chorus] stand up write the soundtrack for your life  it doesn't happen to you you happen to life  stand up, you know you're gonna have to fight  don't wanna lose the will to find your light  stand up, God gave you the gift of life  it doesn't happen to you, you happen to life  stand up, do something with your light  you're a light on a hill, you're meant to shine  so bright so bright so bright so bright  so bright so bright so bright so bright   we're all scared, gotta wonder what's out there  shooting down the ones who did what we wish we dared  everybody's scared to karaoke in the open  afraid we're not as special as what we might be hoping  so we're frozen, haven't chosen just going through the motions  faith and belief, courage overrule emotions  stand up and be counted for something when it's time  decide where you stand, take your hands raise em high  live today through the future's lens  don't wanna wish you could reset and play it again   [chorus]    So, I'm totally pumped!  GOD IS AWESOME  YAHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!! Umm... bare bones... woke up. Ate some weird Meusli "cereal" crap. It tasted good when combined with the awesome breakfast cereal Banana Nut Crunchness... Not plain. That was nasty. And dry. Even  with  milk. YUCK! So, um, I'll have to explain my new-found distaste of it. ^_^;;; That'll be fun. But hey, as a  urlLink wise girl  once said, "Where there are no secrets, there are no lies." Being open and honest with your family tends to be the best way to go. Notice the  tends ... ;P  Where was I? Umm... ate, watched show (Family Feud, Army VS Marines, Marines undoubtedly won... ;D), showered, relaxed, e-mail and stuff, flier create, toenails painted, saw a little of a cheesy soap opera (as part of deal to  get  the toenails painted), started printing, work out, cool down, hand-out, clean-up.   And today at 6:30 I'm going to an  A rea  B ible  S tudy, aka  ABS  because we  urlLink Lake Pointeans  like our acronyms. Yes we do. ^_~ I can say that b/c I am one and have been, like, since fourth grade  at least . But it's not the church, it's the faith, man. All about  urlLink the faith.  Yup yup.   Anyway, I'd better do the clean-up part before I go to that party, I mean, Bible study... umm... just because there is food and swimming (they have a pool! YAY!) involved doesn't make it... okay, it does. :D Unashamed! It'll be awesome though, because God's word is awesome. As is He.   GOD ROX MY SOX!

      Well, this is how it goes, y'all. Here's the down-low. ;) The title is, like, a parody of the saying  World on a String , not to say purity is just on a ring. DON'T GET ANY WEIRD IDEAS, ELIZABETH! ;P Not to single anyone out, but... ^^ Anyway, sleep... I went to bed around tenish last night and woke up around eight. Isn't that  CRAZINESS ? I thought so. Thank goodness! ^_^ No, really.  urlLink Thank goodness, dangit!   Um... let's see... Mom left this morning for grad school, leaving the cutest little note:   Lina & Mike: Good morning! Mommy loves you! I'll be gone all day at the Rockwall PDC & grad school. (sad face) However, you may call Precious if you need anything.  P.S. I'll miss you!   That an... um... I didn't actually end up reading any of the Agony yesterday... and July's coming up, so I'm going to read a WHOLE BUNCH today! Yes, yes I shall! And I know what you're thinking, 'Gosh, Caroline! Procrastination! Tsk tsk!' but that's not the case at all. My main goal is to enjoy myself this summer. Last summer, I didn't. I went to summer school and I finished my summer assignment early, but it was the most un-summer-like-summer of my entire life. Didn't even get to go to  urlLink church camp.  That is a  big deal  for me. So to make a long story short, I started the school year last year burned out and sucked dry. And it was the worst "year" of my life. Almost  died . Okay? So I don't care what you say, I'm never taking summer school and I'm not going to work myself hard this summer at all. Judge all you want, but, baby,  urlLink prepare to be judged.   Let's see. Now that I've scared off, like, half of my audience. ^^;;; Oh well. Um... I was just thinking about my purity ring. I'm thinking of wearing it on my left hand to further remind me of whom I am saving myself fully for. I think I even want to save my  first kiss  for my husband. I mean, not, like, the first kiss be that part in the ceremony "You may now kiss the bride," more like, as a fellow  urlLink barlow girl  said, "When there's a diamond, he gets the smooch :)" =^_^= I want to save as much of myself for my future husband as possible. :D So I don't plan on getting involved in any serious relationship for a  long  time. God's timing is perfect, and, hey, I've got to get to know 'im before I know if he's the one (or  urlLink a prince or a frog  for that matter). ^_^v  Ah... I like that song by Skillet, "You take my rights away..." *listens to it* Ooh!  Invincible ! [^_^] Ya know you just can't kill a man when he's dead. Yup yup.  Ooh! Yesterday, I got to "meet" some of Laura (mai sistah in Christ who lives in Maine?) 's friends from church. Ryan, Katheryn, Jesse... uh... don't remember much else. They were pretty cool. Wow. A youth group where everyone actually -knows- eachother. What a cool thing.  Anyway,  enough with my  unusually  negative babble, I gots to go get a shower or something. ^^

      Um, it's thundering outside and therefore one would expect it to be a  little  cloudy, yeah? It is. So my plan of having bright sunshine waking me up didn't quite work out. But Praise the LORD I slept well for the first time in a long time! YAY!  Had a weird dream where my brother and I were on a trip somewhere and it was  urlLink Halloween  so I was dressed up as Mrs. Linda Muhl (random!) and, like, was wearing a purple shiny fairy's dress (O_o) and had a green pen and all. While we were there this random guy, like, showered me with gifts and said, "Oh,  please  go out with me, Linda!" and that was funny! HA HA! Then I asked him where he lived and he said that he lived in  urlLink Spongebob , Missouri or something like that and I said it just wouldn't work out. But I still got to keep the gifts, I guess? :D    NOTE:  If I find some awesome Christian guy and he asks me out and I met him in Mrs. Muhl's class, that shall be very. scary. Doubt it, but it would be very. scary.  So I got up and had some Banana Nut Crunchness and um... milk *GASP* and I'm not puking up a storm so that's good for a  urlLink lactose-intolerant girlie  like me. And then I got on my PC (apparently) and was on AIM for a bit. Was talking to a friend but then he got all mean or whatever and I needed to get a shower anyway, so I said ttyl! ^_^  Umm... as of late (and probably thanks to that  strange  debutante meeting yesterday) I've really gotten back into the whole nailpolish thing. I mean, the question number three for each occasion in the deb exercise,  What nail polish would be appropriate?  kinda got me to thinking.   So last night I painted my nails on my left hand dark brown and then a few coats of light brown and it somehow turned silver? O_o;; But my other hand... I tried to get my brother to paint it for me, thinking he would do a better job, but... BOY was I  wrong . So that was removed before I went to bed. :)  But I'm looking for pieces of my old huge nail polish collection (I had  urlLink a LOT ); looking for something to match my bathing suit for the ABS (Area Bible Study) I'm going to this Wednesday. It's navy blue with some white stripes and yellow on the top and... I guess you have to see it. ^_^;  But anyway, today is a new day! And I'll probably try to read more of  The Agony  and maybe, if my new glasses come in soon,  urlLink I Kissed Dating Goodbye . That would be awesome! Oh yeah, and  definitely  a work out somewhere in a few hours. If I'm all confused and then work out, everything is so clear and I think so straight and feel so good; it's awesome. But until latah, latah!

      YAY! Praise the LORD! My  urlLink petticoat  came in! For all of you who are wondering why in the world I would want or get a petticoat, it is for my Mesquite Symphony Guild Debutante Cotillion Ball. I get to wear this AWESOME all-white outfit and  urlLink waltz  with my dad (and my date, LORD be willing I should have one) and it's gonna be soooo awesome! What a blessing! Now that the petticoat came in, I have all the required items:     Big white dress   White opera gloves   White ballet slippers   Hose, etc etc etc   White petticoat    Isn't that exicting?! Well, I don't have any hair pieces yet... not have my dress straps been altered to fit, but I have the main items, like, totally down! And that's coolness! I am glad of that. Very. ^_^  Let's see... um... stayed up talking to some friends, as usual, and discovered how I can avoid bringing my entire CD collection downstairs with me to my computer room if I want to hear  urlLink some   urlLink of   urlLink my   urlLink music : windows media player's "copy from a CD" option. Brilliant. Praise God. So along with making backups of every single one of my CD's in CD form, I shall back them all up on my computer as well! Not putting all my eggs in one basket  tends  to be a wise thing.  Mom and Dad went to 3rd Saturday; turns out Mike's flight home from Ohio doesn't actually arrive until 4pm, so we have some time. ^_^ Um... So I just woke up a little bit ago and OH! In case you were wondering why the title of this entry is the title that it is, ( Pyjamas and a Petticoat ) that is because I had to make sure that the petticoat fit properly and, hey, I'm wearing pyjamas. Not usually will I disclose or divulge my current attire, but this was relevent to the message, no? YES.  So that's about all that's going on around here. I'll probably try to read as much of The Agony as possible w/o getting too too carsick and of course read da Bible no matter how carsick I get and OOH! I get to help with Elizabeth's 7/8-year-old class up at the church tonight! I get to do a skit and hang out with the precious little darlings and (more than anything) I get to talk to them about  urlLink JESUS!  Now  that  is about enough to totally make my day.   Yep yep. Soon I shall send this out to all of my family and friends to read. :) Until then, just  urlLink e-mail me, man . ;P

      This morning I woke up (GASP!) and went to the eye-doctor. I got a new prescription; my eyes are very different from eachother. I'm more near-sighted and since my eyes are not aligned on the same "planes," I'm getting some prism in my glasses. They're really cute. I'll post a picture when they're in. Oh, speaking of pictures, this is the easiest way for people to get that I donated 21 inches to  urlLink locks of love  is by picture, so here it is:    So don't mind the little pink me; it's the computer's fault, I'm sure. ;) But yeah, that's my new do and I like it. ^_^  So after the appointment, I delayed lunch for the sake of Mardell's Music Madness sale today only, all CD's ten dollars or less was totally worth it. I totally  stocked up  on great groups like  urlLink Skillet  (of course) and Barlow Girl. Now all I lack of the former group (my favoritism band of all time) is their  Ardent Worship  album. But hey, that's cool. All this earthly stuff ain't going with me when I die anyway. ^_^  Then I came home and vacuumed the upstairs (after my devotional, of course) while listening to Skillet's  Alien Youth  then I did my workout to  Collide  WITH that nice track  Open Wounds  (it's a bonus one when the album was re-released) ;). It was nice; I lifted weights vigorously, jogged for a bit, used the pull-up bar, put weights on my arms and legs and did WHOLE bunch of kicks and punches. It felt GREAT! HOOAH! Praise God! Man, do I sound like a girl who took karate/was in ROTC or what? -_-` Oh well. God made me the way that I am for a reason, which He'll reveal in His time. As said in Falling Up's song:   Father, healer deliver me from broken love Stay hear, closer let me hear your voice of love  Um... right now, I'm listening to Barlow Girl -- Never Alone. [^_^] Mom left for grad school and Dad came home from work. In a bit we're gonna fix some burgers. Oh yeah, I did have lunch, don't worry. I was able to hold on until we got home; I split some nice split pea soup with my mom. :)  So tonight I'll probably try to catch up with some friends whom I met from  urlLink church  camp and whoever else happens to be online. IMing is more convenient than the phone; I can talk to multiple people at once. "Efficient, too," says the engineer's daughter side of me. Well, it is, considering that we have cable internet. *shrugs* So that's about all going on here.   I'm kinda stressing about my first of three summer reading assignments a little now since I haven't had the chance to read much of it today. I mean, until I get my new prescription, I can't stand to read but for 15-20 minutes without feeling seriously carsick. And that's being perfectly still, sitting in a chair in my own home with plenty of  urlLink light   with  my glasses on. Go figure. ;P I'll be okay; the LORD is with me, as always.  Had a slight "identity crisis" earlier. I opened my CD case to pull out  Collide  and in the left pocket was the Skillet CD in all of its punk silver and black sleekness and in the right pocket was the Powerpuff Girls in all of their pink, puffy, girlie splendor. I gasped in revelation; this was me! I am tough like a true cadet (with the body build to prove it) and extremely soft like a squishy, sensitive, sentimental ballerina. *shrugs* God must have a variety in store for my life; never a dull moment, I guess. :) For now, I'm just a mad mix of opposites.

      Hello! Caroline here. I have another blog somewhere else, but, uh, yeah. Dunno why I got one here. Actually I do. Gotcha! ;P Nevermind.

      Hey all. Caroline here to say that conflict (something which she usually does not like at all) has given her a mixed blessing. Isn't that amazing? I thought so.  You see, she and her brother have disagreements a lot and a certain one ws angering her so much that she screamed at him on her livejournal without any sort of  gentleness  or  reverence , certainly not  urlLink seasoned with salt .   Then God spoke to her and she turned around her angry away. What a blessing, hey, hey, hey. Um. Yeah. But aside from that, yesterday was the fourth of July so that meant many things for Caroline...  She woke up and went to  urlLink church.  And in church she was surprised to find us singing "God Bless America" when she does not personally like the song because it sounds like feeble humans trying to command the LORD, the God Almighty to bless America, when He is All-powerful and can do whatever He wants. But at the same time, she figured, it is one of the most religious patriotic songs which she knows of and the church did not want to be unpatriotic, so there ya go.  Then she came home and did her devotional and then went to a big Fourth of July bash at a big country house in Forney w/ her parent's  Adult Bible Fellowship . That was LOADS of fun. Food, prayer, volleyball, basketball (my favorite part), and other stuff. Though I felt a little awkward and lonely there at times, the LORD blessed me with an over-all good time. As the evening went on it got better.  Then I came home and went to bed. I didn't have too much trouble sleeping at all, thank God. And I slept in. Had some breakfast and since I'm starving again, I'm having a little more. That's about it. Any  urlLink questions ? ^_^

      Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiya! BOO-yah! Bettah watch out, Caroline's in Dancing / Battle Mode! Just got finished playing DDR  (AKA Dance Dance Revolution)  for the  second  time today, and I feel grrrrrrrrrrreat! :D  I mean, like, this morning... er... more like late afternoon, I did workout mode for 45 minutes at least. Then after dinner (we went to Martinez's. Yumm... ^_^) I went and practiced driving, and even drove myself home! =-O Yes, yes, I was very shocked as well, but praise God I'm getting better n better! And then I came home a little pumped after the whole "parkway" and "turn lane" incident, lol! Go ahead and  urlLink ask me about it , if ya DARE! ;P  And... umm... I really really really want to go out and DO something with some friends, even if it's just as silly as going to the park or riding bikes or hanging out at  Time for Tea  or  SOMETHING ! You know how that is? I've been stuck in this house for soooooo long just reading and reading and reading and reading THE AGONY and I seem to never be able to read enough! It's frustrating! GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!! I can't StAND SuMMER ReADING AsSIGNMENTS! There's a humungo  urlLink list   urlLink of   urlLink books   urlLink that   urlLink I   urlLink would   urlLink like   urlLink to   urlLink read!  YEESH!  *stares off into space, day dreaming and sighing...* Anyway, as much as I love to devour books on subjects of great worth and enjoyment on my part, I'd better stop this blog and go talk to some friends. Sounds like fun! YAY! So if you want  urlLink talk to me,  lemme know, and please please please please please don't be afraid to  CALL ME!  It's so lonely and boring being the only child! (Well, practically, since my brother just graduated. -_-`) Latah!

      Looks like hardly anyone is here anymore. Not much today. Woke up at ten. Then wasted time, ate, filled out survey, etc etc. Yeah. Haven't read a stinkin' page of LOTR. But Shaina called me and that cheered me up. Gonna go shoe shopping later. But I'd better fix my hair and eat some lunch before my mom comes home. Later.
