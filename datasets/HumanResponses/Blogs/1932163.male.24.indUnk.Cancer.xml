       Concept Description     E-Repute Analysis    The E-Repute Analysis service will analyze automatically an email campaign in 3 stages to track down the email spam solution blocking the bulk mailer.  The first stage focuses mainly on a factor of an email marketing campaign that will provide the relevant information about possible blocking from spam filters. The factor is namely, content of bounce backs received. These emails will be analyzed using the same Bayesian keyword analysis technology used by leading spam filtering companies like Brightmail.  The analysis will assign the campaign probabilities in relation to each email spam filtering solution in our database.   After the 1st stage, we can narrow down our possible leads of the offending email spam solutions using the probabilities assigned. The 2nd stage that comes next will involve testing of the email sent out with the suspected spam solutions. This should effectively confirm the results of our first stage analysis.   The final stage will involve doing a test sending of the email to all known email service providers using the suspected spam solutions. This will allow E-Repute to diagnose all other possible factors causing non delivery status of an email. Some examples of things we will be looking for will be network paths taken by emails, domain bans and other network routing problems associated with email delivery failures.  From these 3 stages, E-Repute will be able track down the spam filters causing email delivery problems and report this to the end user. To handle the large amounts of data we expect to collect and analyze, E-Repute will utilize Oracle for its database and use Unix server farms available from Sun Microsystems for processing.  Note on Bayesian Keyword Analysis: Bayesian keyword analysis simply means by analyzing for suspicious keywords, we can assign a certain probability to the email about its status with various email filtering companies. An example will be that if error code “505” is found in a bounce back, and “505” is found in bounces Hotmail send to reject emails it suspects as spam, this means that the email has a certain probability(of “505”) that it is blocked by Hotmail. To find out the probability needed to assign to each keyword, the E-Repute Data Collection Center (ERDCC) will be used to collect bounce backs from as many email campaigns as possible from customers and using statistical analysis, assign every possible keyword in bounce backs with their correct probabilities in relation to each major spam filter. ERDCC is expected to be tracking data continuously and update the E-Repute Expert system to ensure that structural changes (like standardization of error messages) can be detected and probabilities can be reassigned.  Below is an image of the current anti spam solutions on the market.       Business Model   There will be 3 revenue streams for E-Repute  1)	Subscription fees for the use of our expert systems. The ASP model is feasible here because it is expected that most companies will not want to operate this complex system. For subscribers, all they have to do is to route their emails into our servers for analysis and they can access reports from E-Repute's website. Suggested prices are based on prices that some reputation services like Ironport(www.ironport.com) charges for ensured email delivery. Number of analysis given per month is based on industry practices of sending out at least 1 email per week. (www.clickz.com)       Professional   Advanced   Enterprise    $1500   $7500   $10,000          5 Analysis Per Month   15 Analysis Per Month   Unlimited Number of Campaigns Analysis    $100 for each extra campaign   $50 for each extra campaign  N.A      2)For companies with IT departments capable of hosting and using the E-Repute Analysis servers, there will be revenue streams coming in from actual sales of the servers. In addition, contracts will be drawn up for periodic updates direct from ERDCC for the probabilities values of keywords needed to analyze the emails. Prices are expected to vary for the frequency of updates and processing capability of servers sold.   3) The 3rd revenue stream will come from customers who need to use the service only once or twice. These customers will be charged higher prices than customers in 1).   Costs of developing the system are expected to be in the range of $750,000 ($10 USD/hr for 75,000 man hours) using developers from Russia and India. The equipment itself should be leased until E-Repute has a stable subcriber base to support the maintenance team.    Source of Idea    My current responsibility in my company is to maximize delivery rates of our email campaigns. However, I have a hard time tracking down the various networks and companies that are blocking us using various spam filters. One of my proposed solutions to this was to use content in bounce backs to track these companies down. This was however an extremely tedious job and ultimately I thought of using the same email content analysis technology that major spam filtering companies are using to analyze the bounce backs. This automation will increase the speed we are informed about the delivery status of our emails to various spam filters and allow us to make changes to our email sending process to comply with the spam filters.     Target Market             The primary market for E-Repute will be SMEs with limited resources to do their own analysis. These will include websites like InternetSeer.com, Constant Contact, Wamster and various other companies that depend on email to sell their products. This service should match their needs for quick, cheap and reliable information to act upon for their emailing process. However, as E-Repute gains a larger user base and bigger reputation, it is expected to move up the value chain and position itself to online content providers like ZD-Net, Marketing Sherpa and Gamespot as the solution to use to ensure smooth delivery of emails to their paying subcribers. The final goal is to differentiate ourselves from possible competitors by becoming a premium provider of email delivery analysis for the biggest email advertisers around.(www.senderbase.org for rankings)    Value Proposition    E-Repute should be measured by the increase in conversion rates that result from better email delivery rates. For the cost of investing in E-Repute's service, customers are expected to be able to make rapid informed decisions to tweak their emails or email sending process to remove themselves from spam filters. Such speed will cut down losses from undelivered emails for a current campaign compared to the traditional method where results of a campaign has to be analyzed after the campaign has finished. This means that changes will only be made in the next campaign.    Opportunity Assessment    As the problem of excessive spam on the internet grows, email service providers has turned to spam filtering solution providers that often in their zest to fight spam, blocked out emails from legitimate and responsible bulk mail senders. To compound to this problem for bulk mail senders, the industry for spam filtering solutions is fractured and lacks a single unifying standard in terms of the technology used to filter emails. “False Positive Rate” or the percentage of legitimate and useful bulk mails filtered out wrongly by spam filtering solutions can range from 1% to 25% depending on the technology deployed. With such inconsistent performance from the confusing myriad of technologies used, bulk mailers are often at lost at which spam filter solution provider they should contact when they find their delivery rates of emails dropping. The traditional solution to such problems is often to hire expensive consultants or extra staff to examine the company’s mailing process for possible glitches that is causing spam filters to block the email. The present processes are also slow and out of place on the Internet where conditions can change overnight. E-Repute is a solution that promises to deliver at lower cost, high accuracy and faster speed than any known solution to the problem decreasing delivery rates caused by spam filters. Most importantly, as the rebound in online advertising continues (6.7 billion in 2003 to expected 8 billion in 2005), competition among email marketers and bulk mailers is expected to heat up. This bodes well for E-Repute as we promise as solution that will aid bulk mailers reach their customers inboxes, something which should happen first even before any form of purchase can be made as a result of the email.

      	The idea of the stickiness factor is use messages that stands out from the clutter of messages that people usually receive and allow them to communicate it clearly to the next person. More importantly, the message has to be relevant in the context of many people so that it adheres and propels the person to spread it on.  	For AlphaLife, if rapid market adoption is an objective then a message that appeals more to the positive emotional aspects of owning AlphaLife will be “stickier” than one that tries to expound logically the benefits of Alphalife. This “sticker” emotional appeal will be in the form of messages that promises a better experience outdoors or traveling with the use of AlphaLife. Therefore, with the message, AlphaLife will be the product of talk when people within our target markets think about when they want to make sure that their trips are enjoyable.  	To make the concept stickier, the message that is passed on should have references to certain information sources that interested people (mavens) can gather more data about AlphaLife. A website that gives detailed and clear but without too many technical details about the filtering capabilities of AlphaLife and the high purity of water produced will reinforce their beliefs spurred by the initial emotional message.  	Since AlphaLife is expected to be a durable product, repeated purchases of the product is not expected for until at least 2 years. However, to allow us to continue remind customers about their AlphaLife portable water filters, we plan to have a subscription service for periodic replacements that has to be made to the filters and power source of the water filtration system. Through the subscription service, people will have unlimited usage of the power source and filters that they need conveniently as the items will be sent to them in a package by mail. The package will contain promotional, outdoor-interest stories, travel related tips and other content that will make sure that the image of AlphaLife as the provider of better outdoor/travel experiences stays in their mind.

      	For AlphaLife, the nature of the product requires the consumers to be provided with information about the efficiency of the product. More importantly, consumers has to be assured that water filtered using AlphaLife is safe, potable and probably better than any other filtering process they can bring outdoors. In the market for outdoor retail products, there is little formal advertising done because outdoor product producers often rely on lead users to form the brand image they desire. Therefore, AlphaLife will use a similar strategy to transmit its marketing messages by approaching a Maven(lead user) with in depth knowledge of the outdoors and commands trust among the potential market. The Maven will provide the trustworthy word of mouth review of AlphaLife that will spark the adoption of AlphaLife as the product to use for outdoors water filtration. The roles of Salesmen and Connectors can be filled out with traditional promotional strategies like using the Mavens to endorse AlphaLife on various media channels or sponsoring potential Mavens to use our products for their various outdoor adventures.  Specifically, we are looking for a Maven who holds authority beyond just outdoor adventures because they will make an emotional impact that will have far reaching effects comapared to a impassioned logical appeal to buy AlphaLife. Jim Whittaker, the first American to climb Mount Everest and also a well known activist for peace possess the traits we are looking for in an outdoor product Maven. His knowledge about the outdoors will aid the product R&D and his activities outside of mountaineering will help us reach people who are not considered outdoor adventure enthusiasts. He can be contactable by the information provided here http://www.everestspeakersbureau.com/jimwhittaker.htm   As mentioned, this person will be the Maven because his opinions are likely to be valued importantly by fellow outdoor adventurers who will then spread the word about the equipment he used for outdoor adventures. Similarly, because of his in depth knowledge, he will be able to contribute to the design of our product to ensure that it filters out the different kind of water sources that an outdoor adventurer might encounter.  To enlist him, we have to go beyond normal sponsorships and maybe work out some kind of a deal with him to help him further his peace/environmental activism activities by using our advertising resources to help him. By incorporating a social message into our campaigns with a backing from the Maven, this should have an appeal to a lot of people who will not even consider looking up at information about outdoor products. The execution should be subtle and allow the Maven to grow the image of AlphaLife into socially responsible and well managed company. This will give AlphaLife a brand image that portrays reliability and trustworthiness exactly what we are looking for when we choose water filters.

      Concept Description: TotalGames The product is a gaming engine(Rentrix) that utilizes P2P technology for users to create, play and share games online. Free development tools will be provided for gaming enthusiasts/modders to develop new content and games. For pure gamers, they get free access to the P2P network (GameNet) using a free download of the engine software (Rentrix). Once within the network, they get to play all the games that use the engine from commercial releases to fan produced modifications.   Business Model:  The business model is to give out the engine for free to as many people as possible. More importantly, development tools will be promoted to certain lead users like games modders and leading small independent game design studios. Once the number of game developers and gamers reach the tipping point, this should be a process that feeds on itself as more gamers create demand for more games for developers to work on. The large installed user base of the Rentrix engine will be impossible to ignore for large game publishing companies to ignore. We will expect to procure  license fees for a more robust engine that will allow interested companies to provide larger scale gaming services using the P2P network (GameNet). We will also expect to have a revenue sharing model for the subscription based services provided by commercial companies. Other services provided are market tests which can be conducted by providing interested companies opportunities to release game trials on the GameNet.   Source of Idea:  The inspiration came from the company Valve which developed the 1998 hit game “Half-Life”. Valve adopted an approach that included huge support for game modders(developers) using the game engine for its “Half-Life”game to produce new content. These freely available fan  produced modifications of “Half-Life” kept the game popular for almost 7 years in an industry where an average game has a shelf life of 6 months. Even until now, more mods are coming out for Half-Life and the Half-Life network which supports a list of servers providing online game play for Half-Life and its various mods is registering 100,000 unique users online at anytime of the day.  Target Market:  The target market will be all large gaming companies looking for easy access to a huge base of users who are gaming fans. The companies can push their software using the GameNet and reach out to millions of gamers within days for game trials.    Value Proposition:    Rentrix provides commercial game developers with an engine with a huge installed base to work with. The engine will also be constantly tweaked for performance from feedback of game modders. This means games that run on Rentix will be less bulkier and runs faster.   GameNet is a source of all the lead users for gaming. Releasing games on GameNet means direct access to them and potentially speeding up adoption(P2P sharing) of a game for a company. This reduces costs that might be incurred in traditional marketing campagians makes up a huge part of the costs of producing a game.    GameNet is the place for gamers to look for and share the latest games and their modifications (excluding those that requires a fee).     Opportunity Assessment:  The gaming industry is now almost the same size as the movie industry and it is projected to grow as Internet usage grows and online gaming gets more popular. P2P technology has being proven to be infectious in its adoption if it has products that are free and of value to the users. The game modding scene which is like the cottage industry for amateur game development has grown tremendously as more people jump into the wagon after a home grown mod for “Half-Life”, “Counter-Strike” struck commercial success. The only thing left will be the use of a game engine to tie all these elements to spark a change in the way the gaming industry sells their games. From boxes to downloads online.

      Concept Description: Connectiz The idea is to create an e-commerce site that will allow start ups to look for outsourcing deals in a manner that is not unlike travel sites like Expedia. Performance reviews, prices, portfolios are among the information that will be displayed to allow easy comparision for deal seekers.  Business Model:  There will be 2 revenue streams. One which is a revenue sharing model with the outsourcing companies placing their ads on the website and the other will be membership fees for companies who want premium services like deal broking and payment management.  Source of Idea:  I was looking for outsourcing leads for my company and encountered a lot of problems trying to recommend a good deal to my bosses as it is very hard to compare deals when there is no industry standard and everyone claims that they are the best.  Target Market: The target market will be start-ups and small firms which need services but does not have the time to look for good and affordable alternatives.  Value Proposition:  The website is a one stop exchange for all services that a small company might ever need and give enough non biased information for the company to make a more informed purchase than a mere google search.   Opportunity Assessment:  The small business market is the largest domestic sector and is highly fragmented. An exchange what will allow different small businesses to advertise services or look for services will be a boom as there is no easy way to do such things now.

      Concept Description: Instanet The idea is to make use of all existing WiFi(all standards) devices in the vicinity to form an "instant" network to exchange data. This makes a WiFi hard point capable of extending its service range beyond its broadcast range by tapping on intermediate WiFi devices to connect to devices outside its broadcast range. This can be accomplished by creating software that can automatically configure the WiFi device in question to connect to the appropriate "instant" network in its range. The instant network will serve as intranet when Internet cannot be accessed and users can exchange various types of information(gaming,file exchange, etc.) between each other using applications developed by Instanet.   Business Model:  Usage of the software is by subscription and will cost around $20 USD a month for unlimited usage. This is much cheaper than current WiFi access plans and is targeted at lifestyle users who do not need the kind of service reliability status needed by businessmen.  Source of Idea:  I wanted to use WiFi in Upenn but was frustrated by the lack of access points and the difficulty in configuring my laptop to access the network. So I thought of this idea to make it easy to find and connect to a network that will encourage non techies to join the WiFi revolution  Target Market: The target market as mentioned earlier will be the non tech savvy that nevertheless will benefit most from a simplified and economic way to access real time information online. This can include the educational sector like elementary and high school students who will benefit from this.  Value Proposition:  The software will allow any WiFi user to connect to another WiFi device with minimum fuss and also allow possible access to the internet or a local intranet if there is a connection around. Seamless connection with affordable prices is the VP for the product.  Opportunity Assessment:  WiFi is here and it is to stay. But right now it is simply a technology that is being used extensively by early adopters. It has yet to reach the general public and has not fully extended its capability to change the way we receive information. This is because the WiFi sector has being hindered by a lack of a unifying standard to connect any network and at places outside of access points without charging prohibitive costs on the consumer. And without doubt, there are plans to produce WiFi devices that allow seamless connection between different networks. However, these devices still depend on the availability of the Internet and Instanet intends to make informal intranets as interesting and useful as the Internet.
