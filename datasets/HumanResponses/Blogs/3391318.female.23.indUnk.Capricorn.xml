       Hearing:  The kitten eating tuna  Seeing:  Besides the obvious?  Smelling:  fresh air  Tasting:  Saliva  Feeling:   urlLink     Quote of the moment:  The best thing you've ever done for me is to help me take my life less seriously, it's only life after all.     One good blog deserves another. I went to sleep last night around 3am, so my creative juices have as much flow to them as a ninty year old pus...So here I am, crashed out on the couch,unable to move and lo and behold here comes a biography on Mama Cass...Cass Elliot...Ok! The Mamas and the Papas, you know, California Dreaming... Alltheleavesarebrownandtheskyisgreyblahblahblah... Now, I happen to enjoy the music of Cass Elliot and the rest of the crew but did I want to see a story on a chunky woman who really wanted to get married and have children but because of her looks there were no takers? Yes. And I'll tell you why. Because Cass Elliot did not die choking on a sandwhich. There's a moral there but I'm not telling you what it is.

       urlLink     I'm gunna find my way back home. I'm gunna find my way back to me. So dodge the tide and ride and ride until it simply ceases to be.  - Snippet of mine    Mint Tea... You are Mint Tea! Naturally sweet you have a happy-go-lucky attitude. The world is full of fun and wonder! Although you can be naive at times and quite aloof to your surroundings you know how to have good clean fun! (And sometimes not so clean fun!) Most people see you as cute and very gentle by nature and it is most likely true. You have a great outlook on life and you try not to let things get to you. Go you!    urlLink   What type of Tea are you? {-With Anime Pictures!-}     brought to you by  urlLink quickly    All the wrath of all the Gods cannot shake me from the pedestal that I have claimed as Mine. It took twenty-three years of unfinished work  and unbeaten paths to lead me to the simple conclusion that I'm not gaining anything from keeping my mouth sealed shut. We both worry about what our thoughts will sound like when they actually come out as words. I think everybody does. We worry so much about being judged, about being young, and always knowing what to say. If we all feel like that, or even if only a majority of people feel like that, does that not make us for the most part all equals? All afraid of the same things. Sounding dumb, being ridiculed by our peers.  Let me tell you simply. The time in my life when I was the most happy was the time when I didn't give two shits. I trusted the Universe, Society, and myself. I trusted that I could say and do whatever I needed to and the world would not gasp and crumble around me.  And then, somewhere along the way, I conformed. I decided that it was better to try and figure out the right thing to say versus what was running through my mind. The funny part about conforming is that it makes you the same as everyone else. You not only join the rat race of life, but you also enter into the intellectual rat race.  I refuse to take part in these games anymore. I'm killing my rat and replacing it with something with wings so it can fly if need be.

       urlLink     Right Now:  Were only gonna die from our own arrogance, so we might as well take our time.    So my life is like a second grade soap opera thanks to a little something called cannabis. It's everywhere. Hard to avoid. But once you bump into it, it can be a pleasant experience. And then once it falls into the "wrong" hands, it can be a not so pleasant experience. Case and point. My step father, nice man and all former pot head, recently got his hands on some. Now, up until this point, everything about this scenario is fine, except *gasp* he's married to my mother. My mother. You do not sneak around at weird times and expect someone like my mother to turn a blind eye...oh no. This woman is the Queen of Mountains Out of Molehills Land. So she thinks he is having an affair with another woman and I get to hear about it constantly. The funniest part about this, it that technically, he is! "Honey, meet my newest most favorite girl, Mary Jane."  And like with most affairs, I am just keeping all crossable body parts crossed for the guy that he doesn't get caught. Forgiveness can be a bitch. So this buds for you, my sneaky not so smart friend. May you go down alone on this particular ship:   I smoke two joints in the morning I smoke two joint at night I smoke two joint in the afternoon It makes me feel all right   I smoke two joints in time of peace And two in time of war I smoke two joints before I smoke two joints, And then I smoke two more   Daddy he once told me, "Son, you be hard workin' man" And momma she once told me, "Son, you do the best you can" Then one day I meet a man, He came to me and said, "Hard work good and hard work fine, but first take care of head"   Whoa rock me to the night Ja say

       Hearing:  Birds chirping, distant thunder  Seeing:  Work stuff  Smelling:  fresh air  Tasting:  Almond Cookie  Feeling:   urlLink     Quote of the moment:  And I'll make it to the moon if I have to crawl...      urlLink        urlLink Find your Role-Playing Stereotype  at  urlLink mutedfaith.com .      So my Mom is trying to fix me up with the son of one of her clients. Supposedly he's good looking in a solid average type way and apparently a real go getter, which is already F*ing funny because I am one of -the- biggest procrastinators out there. Beyond that, the last guy my mom tried to fix me up with turned out to be gay. Yes, I have hit the "Whooops, you're gay." button. He was cute and seemed really supportive of my budding massage business but alas, gayer than a man in pink tights on the first day of Spring.           I can remember back, back to when I was a kid and I would come to my mom for social advice. How to handle all the crap that happened on the playground. It never worked. She would give me all the same advice everyone else was getting but just at the wrong time. "Ignore him, he'll stop." Well Jason didn't stop until I kicked his ass one day after English. A knee to the balls and a smack of my Trapper Keeper against his forehead. I still remember the delicious sweaty smack of cheap plastic hitting empty brow. Ahhh.   'Til this day my Mom and I both disagree on this point. She thinks she gives great advice and knows the situations of my life. Wrong. Sad to say that she only thinks she knows me. But all the while she was giving me this advice and I was taking it, I learned to go in the opposite direction with it. Gotta go with what works.    So I find myself now, here, supposedly fixed up with "Mr. Perfect" because we're both so much alike. Well, I can't knock the guy totally because I've never met him. The few facts that I do know, I really don't like too much. Go getter, grounded, has his own house, and doesn't date "bimbos". I can live with the last one to a certain extent but I have a feeling that I might fall into the category of "bimbo" with this one. I like to be silly and laugh and make the world an entire personal joke. Sure, I have a deeper side. It manifests itself in different ways to different people but I relate to other humans through humor and this type of person seems like they have a short supply of it. I think he would look at my sarcasm and my beloved procrastination as bad things. I guess I'm judging because I feel judged. I know the intent behind this romantic shoving that is going on is good and the two doing the shoving are loving mothers but still...can you imagine how awkward it will be to meet this person? "So  you're  the one my mother wants me to marry!" Yeeeesh.

      Hee Haw.      When I was younger my mom used to tell me this story. I think it's one of the only "tales with a moral" I remember from growing up that still so profoundly impacts my life today. The story is simple.    One day, an old man, a young boy, and a donkey were traveling down a dirt road. The old man began to weary before they reached the town so without much thought, he climbed up onto the donkey's back while the young boy led the trio into the nearest town. As they entered the town, a bunch of ladies gathered in one corner eyed the threesome then declared, "Oh, look at that! The poor child has to walk while the adult rides on the back of the donkey. For shame!"    Hearing this, the old man and the young boy switch places, the child now riding the donkey with the man leading. Further into town, they fall prey to more whispers.  "What's this? A strapping young lad riding a donkey while an elderly man is forced to walk? This is not right!"  So again, the pair eye each other and change their methods. This time, both the man and the boy began to ride the donkey through the town. Of course, the townspeople then took pity on the donkey. A poor donkey having to carry the burden of two people. Terrible.  To remedy this, both of them climb off of the donkey,each taking part of the reign and then proceed to walk the donkey.  As they leave the town, a final banter of words follow them.  "Look at this. A perfectly good donkey and neither of those two fools are riding it. The donkey has it easy!"   This is life. People will always find something to pick on you for. No matter how you live your life, slacker to workaholic, student to teacher, Hermit Crab to Social Butterfly...They will find a way to try and take you down. I wouldn't exactly say it is a malicious vibe just built in. People covet stupid things on a daily basis. I, personally, never understood the concept of jealousy. Who wants to have a friend who's not interested in having you? What's the point of getting pissy because someone gets to sleep in every morning and you might have to get up early? To be jealous is a grand waste of time and feeding people who are jealous of you or covet your type of lifestyle is also a waste of time. When are people going to wake up and see that they can have whatever they want? Want to sleep in? Change your hours! Change your job! Roll in late! Don't sit and glare because you feel like you "have to". Want to go on vacation? Save your money! Find someone who will split the cost with you! Take out a loan!         Of course the reality of time does play a factor in all of these things but the lesson is rarely about instant self gratification anyway. I, personally, would have trampled all of those people while riding the donkey with the old man and young boy hanging from the saddle bags. Got something to say, say it. Don't make me open up a can of trample-ass!
