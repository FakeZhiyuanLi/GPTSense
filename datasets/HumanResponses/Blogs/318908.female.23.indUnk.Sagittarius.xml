      I should be motivated and productive now. I just got a job offer from Mathematica and I'm sorta on cloud nine about that.. and yet I continue with the dysfunctional lifestyle. I need to start being accountable and responsible. Well, technically I'm still waiting to hear the details of the job, like when I would start et cetera, so I feel like I'm waiting for that. Waiting is probably the spawn of the devil. I need to realize that every day matters, even if my future is bright!

      Starting a journal  again  in hopes that it won't get discarded in one of my fits of "ugh, my life is either boring or unfit for public consumption".  I threw away my 400+ page high school journal, as well as a box containing twenty or so of the only love letters I've ever received in my life. Why?! I sort of regret this, and will especially regret deleting this journal, as my writing is now somewhat approaching decent quality.   Strangely, another motivation for being here is to move away from having a .plan.  haha, oh wait. The likelihood of  that  ever happening? Close to nil. It's one of my secret goals in life: to have a .plan when I'm 87 years old. Yup. But everyone else is doing this blog thing. I certainly don't crave permanence. I abhor it even. So why am I here? Maybe for the relative publicity.   Anyway, I'm a physicist with a sense of humour who writes best when under great stress. (Unfortunately, I'm currently understressed.)  I graduated from ... oh never mind. I don't want to go through all the introductions again.   I didn't get any valentines today, though a sent a few anti-valentine e-cards. (Is that lame or what?)   Ack! I  have  to get my act together. I have an interview tomorrow (yes, Sunday!) and have to teach a lecture on Tuesday that I haven't even begun to prepare for. I'm a bit frustrated with myself. I also want to go to church and have been invited to lunch with family. I can do this! I seriously need to be in grad school now. *sob* so my life can at least be insane and out of control but productive?  I dunno. Sometimes I just want to have a nine-to-five job that challenges me to think and be creative, but still have time to have a life. I have neither right now, and it sucks enormously. Simple tasks are blown all out of proportion. Gar.

       Oil at $40 a barrel   Oil has become more expensive because of  urlLink instability  in coutries (Kazakhstan, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Venezuela) that are the biggest sources.

       Academia a meat grinder?   Yet another novel genre of item for sale on eBay -- co-authors for academic papers! What is the incentive? William Tozier, offering 40 hours of his time towards publishing a collaborative scientific paper with the winner of the auction, has an Erd&ouml;s number of 4. Can you  imagine  if your worth as a professor hinged on a single number, having to do with your degrees of separation from a great mathematician? This is, according to  urlLink this chronicle article , for real.   What I don't understand is Tozier's idea that academia is uneccesarily elitist. My god, man! That is, like, the definition of academia. Land of the elite. If you can't stand the heat, get out of the fire dude.

       Right wing conspiracy   How much does religion fuel the anti gay-marriage front? Undoubtedly, that is the central argument the right wing  uses  to convince everyone that the sanctity of marriage is in grave danger. But  urlLink Scagliotti argues  that it's merely a ploy to win votes and open wallets.   I got tired of hearing straight progressives call the struggle for my civil rights "identity politics" when the truth was that their own identity as members of the heterosexual majority was being mustered and manipulated to drive American politics to the right.   It's not gay marriage that they so much care about.   They really wanted to roll back environmental laws like Act 250, which had slowed down developers' dreams of paving over the state in asphalt, or repeal educational reforms like Act 60, which for the first time made rich ski towns pay into poor towns' school budgets.

      Nation letter didn't get published, but I did get a personal response to the effect that "It's not about whether Cheney avoided the draft." Oh! I'm sorry ... I guess I was lead astray by the  entire article  being devoted to dragging Cheney through the muck. I was already in agreement with Nichols that the GOP is inconsistent. You can't call a Vietnam vet a hypocrite for becoming an anti-war activist while simultaneously turning a blind eye to those in your own party who avoided the draft.   My point is that his article was poorly written, unless it's some new form of argument (like satire) that I am not aware of. Argument by playing the other side and showing how ridiculous it is? I'd say, go ahead, as long as you are aware of what you're doing. But they say ... if you work too hard at playing the other side, you start to believe it. And Nichols really had done his research. So I decided he was serious in the end, after a moment of wondering, "is this a joke?"  Anyway, I'm going to keep reading and submitting letters to editors (not just the Nation). One day I'll get published. Technically I have been published before. Twice in my life! But that was back in high school and ... um .. I feel as though I am more articulate now so I should keep writing.

       fetchmail   Well, it seems as though I have fetchmail and procmail up and running! Kinda pathetic that it took so much trial and error. I guess I don't have much patience when it comes to doing computer tricks. However, I'm psyched, because this means that I can finally start pruning and sorting my inbox.   4000 messages I have in there now, and not enough quota to put it in folders (at least on the mhc server). I have been downloading messages for over an hour now though, which causes small worry. It's taking more than a second per message, which is way slower than ftp.   I need to figure out how all this UNIX stuff works. What's IMAP and POP3 and TCIP? Do I even care? I'm not that much of a geek, to tell the truth. Hey, evidence the fact that I'm using Blogger, instead of creating my own blog script :-)

       A letter I wrote to the Nation   I am puzzled by  urlLink John Nichols's elaborate criticism of Cheney . I think it goes without saying that in judging others, we are hypocrites. But that is a truism and not worth writing an article about. How can we dare to speculate upon another's reasons for enlisting or avoiding a draft? War is not the only way to serve one's community. I would be the last to say that Cheney's life is somehow more valuable than any of the others from Casper, WY who died, but it is absurd to say that someone died  in his place . I wonder what his daughter would think to hear that she had been born "conveniently" so that her father could avoid the draft. Even if there is a modicum of truth to that, it is merely mud-slinging. We expect as much from candidates entrenched in the political mire, but not from the usually clear-sighted Nation writers.   with respect, Margaret Trias Yale graduate student, Physics

      I've been wanting to read some Frayn for a long time, ever since seeing  Copenhagen , and he  urlLink explains eloquently  why I haven't been able to!     Because the consumer of books or plays, including myself, very reasonably wants to know or have some idea in advance what the book or the play is going to be like. It is the same as buying breakfast cereal: If you buy a packet of cornflakes, you want to be sure it will contain cornflakes and not muesli. It is very irritating if the packet doesn't contain what you expected it to contain. Similarly it is a reasonable demand from the theatergoer or novel reader that he should get a constant product, which is identified by the author's brand name.   And the problem is that he doesn't have a brand name. All his novels and plays are so radically different that I have no idea what I'm going to get. I've been looking in vain for something Copenhagenesque. Why?  For all that I lament over there being nothing new under the sun, I secretly want my favourite authors to write my favourite books twenty times over and publish it with different dust-jackets so I can read it again and pretend that i've broadened my horizons. I guess books are like music that way. Familiar words and phrases, or other "intellectual fingerprints" as he calls them, sound closer to the truth.

      Oh man. I just googled my date for senior prom (back in high school) and he works for NPR. I still count him among the significant somethings, even though we were only together one blissful night. How sad. I loved flirting with him, basked in the attentions. Unfortunately, I really was not comfortable with his physical advances. But the conversations... he was perhaps the most brilliant of any of the boys I've been "with". I would marry him only for the certainty that we'd not be one of those pathetic silent couples with nothing left to say. And I don't think he would hurt a fly.  We parted quickly, as graduation was like the day after prom, or something ridiculous. I only wrote him once during college, and ran into him another time. I was sad that he didn't seem enthralled to see me particularly, and mostly talked with Greer whom I admit, had been friends with him longer than I had.  Maybe for him it really was just physical. Or perhaps he liked me a lot and it hurt him that I rejected him physically?

       Conflict of interest in Medical research   60 percent of U.S. clinical studies are funded by drug and biotech firms:  urlLink NPR report   There isn't much that JAMA (Journal of American Medical Association) can do other than check for reasoning and statistics, and they cannot reject papers solely on the basis of how the research was funded. As a result, some studies may not report data that shows the products of a biotech firm in a negative light.   Shannon Brownlee wrote an  urlLink article for Washington Monthly  about this issue.   Companies routinely delay or prevent the publication of data that show their drugs are ineffective. The majority of studies that found such popular antidepressants as Prozac and Zoloft to be no better than placebos, for instance, never saw print in medical journals, a fact that is coming to light only now that the Food and Drug Administration has launched a reexamination of those drugs.

      Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the Earth. (Beatitudes, Sermon on the Mount)  Some people make me feel small and insignificant. As if walking on the sands of time, I make little to no impression that is not swiftly washed away by the ocean. My laughter doesn't resonate, my thoughts don't penetrate. My being isn't fully existent. I'm not a character, overflowing with charisma and essence. I am inessential, illusory, translucent.  They don't mean harm, I'm sure. They don't mean to squash me like a bug. But they are loud and boisterous. They exude confidence and intelligence through their pores. They are free to dance in nakedness, run wild and create lives of glamour and style.   They have firm identities, and strangers quickly remember them because they are unique and powerful. They have an aura that surrounds them and basks in the spotlight. They are who they are and nothing less.   What does it feel like to be one of those? Some of them are 'popular' but that isn't the only way to be one of them. You have to be extraordinary to a degree. You have to be loved. It isn't all about intelligence, although that is an important key. It's about rising up and existing as an opaque entity. Having a name that suits you. I am in search of my name. I am working to break out of my shell.  Is there really such a poverty in me, of soul? Can I be so empty and forgotten? And if so, what is the reason. Am I closer to God, or farther away. Am I not of this world, am I accursed, or is it just that I'm living on a level. I want to see my real self. I want people to think I'm awesome and fearless.  Calley says that I like to think about things. That's true. And Charis wouldn't keep writing to me if there weren't something that she gained from my being alive and responding to her. Do they see me? Am I in focus for them? The critique I got from the Princeton Review guy was that I needed to work on my "presence" in front of the class. At first I misunderstood, and thought he meant some combination of board-work and projection of my voice. But it's so painfully obvious right now that he meant, by presence, existence. If you are not present, you aren't there. You aren't a figure, a symbol of yourself. You are nothing.  All I can do is pray. That one day I will change, I will fall into my body and my soul. I will create myself out of these shards of thoughts and feelings.

      I might work for Michel Devoret this summer! Or at least June... We shall see, as DeMille hasn't said one way or another whether he has space in lab.  Ugh. I woke up at 11:30 today cuz I was up until two on ICQ. At least I went running so there is a slight chance that I might be exhausted enough by midnight to fall asleep and get back onto regular sleeping patterns by tomorrow. Going out to eat salad and finish this book I'm working on.   Then maybe I'll come home and be productive! Griffiths particles, baby.

      This morning I did a horrible thing: I alphabetized my bookshelf. I had this whole system of thematicised ordering up until now, but for whatever reason, it struck me to do this abominable act. Luckily, I'm moving soon so all my anti-entropic efforts will be lost entirely in a short month. My god. Less than a month and I'm moving to New Haven.  I still don't know about this Ireland thing. Mom, Calley and Tina are ecstatic about it, and so am I. But I wonder if I shouldn't rather get a normal job and study for the quals. It isn't too late! I have to sign the contract for Yale housing by the 10th of May. All these older and wiser people are giving me the thumbs up to do this wild and crazy thing. I don't feel that I've done anything to deserve it. I haven't proven myself to be responsible. That's what makes me feel ill.  I need to not blow off studying physics, I need to get a real job. I've had my fun, even if it wasn't very fun.

      I didn't get out to run until 9:10PM tonight because I was busy packing all day. I should not run at night, but hey. Ran along the Charles to my usual spot -- an outdoor adult play-ground (what do you call it?) which has, among other things, a bar for chin-ups -- and managed six of them! (up from four).  My run was brisk, especially the first half, and I was mentally very alert, as is usual for me at night. Unfortunately I was having back pain and three hours later (now) bending over is extraordinarily painful. I think it might be a combination of PMS muscle tightening that might have caused me to run in a jarring way, the fact that I've been sleeping on a very squishy futon for the past few nights, and moving lots of heavy boxes. Tonight, I think I'll go back to my thirty-year old mattress that is hard as a rock, because it never gave me back pains.   Anyway, the next few days are going to be complete chaos, as I start my new life as a grad student at Yale and move from Boston to New Haven. Here's to hoping I manage to squeeze in a good run every day!   Stats  run: Charles River (5 miles?) time: 50 min

      I think I've been running faster recently, though I'm not sure why. I imagine much of it is psychological, because I certainly haven't had the healthiest lifestyle recently! Yes, I've been getting obscene amounts of sleep (like 9-10 hours) for the past month. But I haven't been eating much nor staying hydrated.   But let me begin properly, since this is a new blog (she says optimistically). I should outline some goals I hope to achieve.    First:  I have been a sporadic runner for five years, averaging about 6 runs per month, but sometimes going for weeks without a run. This is not good. I think it leaves me prone to injury and probably doesn't put me in any better shape than getting no exercise would. I know that running helps me focus mentally throughout the day, and sleep better at night, and I also love the hours of meditation and concentration that running affords. So I would like to become a  serious  runner. I hope that keeping this journal will motivate me not only get out there every day and pound asphalt (or do cross-training, strength work-outs), but to craft my life in a conscious way around my overall physical and mental health.    Second:  I want to become faster (and stronger). On teams in high school and college, I was always one of the slowest, but I've always wondered if there weren't some way to break through and be faster. I know there are natural limitations, but I know plenty of people who seem to have the same body type as me and yet, manage to run faster. I don't know  how  I will accomplish this goal, but I hope to start reading runner's magazine and doing some research. Taking a wild guess though, I think I will have to do more speed training :-)  (duh). That, actually, seems to work marvelously. (At least, it did last summer. I think I managed to break the 8 minute mile a few times..)    Third:  Right now I'm 5'2 and 123lbs. I don't particularly love my figure. I  like  it (and I have gone through phases of really hating it). But I think being somewhere within the 110-115 range would be closer to ideal, because I'm small boned. Besides, any weight I can take off my knees would be a good thing.   Fourth:  Speaking of my knees... I've been thinking about whether running is a good idea, considering that for the past five years, I have rarely been able to run without pain in my knees, due to pronating feet and having essentially no arch. I have been reading so many stories of people who have run with  far  more serious injuries and physical constraints. So hopefully, once I have health coverage (starting in August! Yay!) I will see a professional podiatrist physical therapist whatever you call it, and see about maybe some inserts.. or some other solution. I know there must be one!   Fifth:  I hope to join a running club in New Haven (I'm moving in just a couple of days!) and maybe get some insight into how to have very healthy eating habits. I think, aside from my daily cup of coffee (which I don't need! I'm actually not addicted) and more sweets than neccessary, I'm getting all of the good stuff that I need. Lots of vegetables and fruits, and meat twice a week. But who knows. I picked up mostly good habits from my family, growing up. I tend to just enjoy healthy foods more than crap. I absolutely detest deep-fried anything or insanely sweet desserts. So the point is that I don't  think  about what I eat, because I don't have bad habits to avoid (other than coffee). I'd like to be more conscious of what I consume.   Sixth:  I am a complete glut for distance. If I'm feeling good, it takes all my will power to  stop  running. This means, for one thing, I will very rarely run shorter than 3-4 miles per outing (unless I'm feeling genuinely rotten -- but then I generally won't even attempt to run in the first place!). Anyway, my goal is to first off, learn to compromise. Tell myself, okay -- if you only run three miles today, then you can go to the gym and work off the rest of your energy. The idea being to prevent injury. And secondly, to get to a point where it's  okay  if I run 12 miles, because I'm in shape! I hope to get to a point where I can regularly take 12 or 14 mile runs on Sunday (or Saturday). But that might be pipe dreams. I need to figure out the knee dilemma first.  Whew. I think that's all for tonight, at least as far as introductions.

      I am exhausted and hungry -- so this is going to be extremely terse, because I have to go out for dinner before I lose my head! Long run. Was out for about two hours, the last half hour of which was just walking. I felt like I could go on running forever, until about 1hr 30 mins into it. Fortunately I had already turned back by that point. The only issue was soreness of my quads -- and hence not enough freedom in my stride. But after about two miles that got slightly better.. and then worse.. Well, I spent a lot of time in the sun. Boy am I going to sleep like a log tonight!    stats  7.3mi, 80mins wk#1 = 32.7 wk#2 = 12.0 wk#3 = 26.6

      Ran in the morning for a change. From 8-9 AM. A humid morning turns into a rainy day. I can't believe how sore I am. I guess I did have a light week in terms of running, but I wouldn't think that I could lose anything in only a week? Perhaps it's just cumulative.  Today the hills were a bit rough, because of soreness, but other than that it was quite smoothe. At the very end I got a bit of an adrenalyn kick and was running fast - downhill - not a good thing! But fun. Knees are still there. Even though I haven't been in pain, there are small warning signs, telling me not to look this gift horse in the mouth. Like when I change directions suddenly, or start to run on uneven grass, there is a bit of pain. On level ground though, as long as I'm not too fatigued, everything is fine. Wow. Let's hope this keeps up.   Stats  6.6 mi, 64m, 120.5lb

      Why am I so sore? Otherwise, a good strong run. Especially on the hills. I like that I have been waking up so early these days! Was reasonably hydrated today, but had coffee. Clearly I'm not in the mood for writing tonight.   Stats  6 mi., 60m, 122lb

      It's been a while. Last weekend was the family reunion and I didn't even bring my running shoes. Lazy bum.  Today was  slooooowww  for no particular reason. Lots of inertia. At one point I just sat down for about five minutes, simply because I could, and it seems like precisely what my body wanted to do. Go figure! Otherwise I was feeling strong and flexible, and not in any sort of pain. Why couldn't I up the speed? Who knows.   stats  6.6 miles 1:15 or something ridiculous like that 119 lbs

      Not a bad run. Mosquitos have started! My knees are only slightly aggravated for the first twenty minutes, but after a short stretch, they were perfectly fine. Busy day! I wasn't extremely fast today. Over the weekend I ate a lot of junk. Bah. I lost 2 pounds last week, but I think I managed to gain one of them back. Argh! I wish my weight weren't so volatile (at least in the upward direction!).    Stats  4.7 miles 42 minutes

      Ran to Sebec St. this morning. It was a bright sunshiney day, but not too hot! In fact, there was a cool breeze every so-often. But I definitely got a bit too much sun today because I spent a few hours at the International Festival of Arts in downtown New Haven afterwards. I took a nap in the afternoon out of physical exhaustion. It was quite nice, but as usual (I hate naps) it went on for longer than needed and I wasted many hours of a perfectly lovely afternoon.  But the run itself was great. I can now take hills with great strength. The only weird thing I've noticed is that if I stop to stretch while running it has the paradoxical effect of causing my legs to tighten up, my and knees to hurt. So we're just not going to do that!   Stats  7.3 miles 70 minutes Week #1 = 32.7 miles (weeks go from Fri-Thurs)

      I was feeling so mentally burned out after work today. I was there from 9 to 7pm! Although, granted I took a long-ish lunch "break" wherein I ran around doing errands. Running has cleared my mind somewhat, but this ritual takes two hours out of my day. Not only that, but two hours out of my evening. So on days like today, I am left with only 2.5 or so hours of free time during which to cook and eat dinner (one hour) and check e-mail (30 minutes). So here I am with a grand total of one hour left before bed. Sigh. How do people ever get anything done without never sleeping?  Anyway, the two days off did my body good, I was running fast and all that, up until the point where I stopped to stretch a little. Upon starting up again, my knee was hurting! Ugh. Running is great, but it's medicine. And do I have two spare hours in my day to devote to it?  Solution may be:  reduce mileage!  Duh ...    Stats  6.6 miles 60 mins

      Was especially sore today, and hence did not run very fast. Strange that I  wasn't  sore after my nine-miler! It might be a sign that I should decrease my mileage, but my thinking is that I'll cut back to 3-4 miles during the week, and save the long ones for weekends.   Uh... just checked on mapquest for mileage, and it seems I ran almost five miles?! Is it possible that I was averaging 9 minute miles? My total elapsed time was 45 minutes, but that includes five minutes of walking. Perhaps I underestimate my speed, but I have been assuming 10 minute miles. Hmm... perplexing.  Perhaps tomorrow I'll head to the track.   Stats  4.9 miles 45 mins

      I did some combination of running on the road and the trail. Almost ran up the whole thing, but had to walk for a few minutes, total. Not bad. Was feeling rather energetic today, but even so, by the end my feet were dragging slightly. I attribute this mostly to the fact that I'm not in the best shape yet! That will take another month, if I run consistently and don't get injured, so I am in no hurry. I should be happy that I am even able to do seven miles without excessive walking! Need to be better about drinking water.   Stats  7 miles (estimate) 75 mins

      Half of this run was crappy. I got the idea from the med school website to go up the Hartford Turnpike (that was the nice part!) and come down State St. which is a horrible place to run. It's miles and miles of flat highway (albeit unpopulated by cars) on either side of which are all these exceedingly boring run-down buildings, all of them with a half-abandoned look. It is a no man's land. I even ran past a burnt car that looked, from all evidence, to have been  set on fire . I have to wonder why, and I'm scared to think that it was just for kicks. Like, Hey, dead car, let's burn it. I dunno, I just had a bad feeling about the area. I am not going back.   On a positive note, I found East Rock park and ran along it for a bit. Next time I'm actually going in to the park!  Oh yeah, so I'm going to be sore tomorrow. :-)   Stats  9 miles (estimate) 95 minutes

      My first run in New Haven! I ran up Whitney St to where it crosses Treadwell St and back. Nothing too exciting cuz I don't know where all the good running places are yet. 55 mins. This girl who lives on my floor told me something about the East Rock summit. I might try that tomorrow.  From  urlLink info.med.yale  there are directions for various routes. Must try all of these! They say New Haven can be dangerous, and never to go south of the Med School. Oops.. that's how I got here from Amtrak. Well, I'm not dead yet.  Also did lots of walking, and biked to the grocery store. Yes, overkill on exercise today. I am so hungry and exhausted!

      Feeling much less tight today. I knew a bit of stretching would do it. However. I have decided that the time has come to purchase a new pair of running shoes. I've been having this pain in my heel and arch, and even my ankle on my right foot. It might be an injury due to the gods of running hating me, or it might be that these shoes are shot. So I'm going to pray to the gods of running... and buy new shoes! Maybe next week. Okay... yup. And I'm not going to bother with all the statistics and timing, unless I get serious about timed miles, because frankly i'm not getting much faster in general, and speed is not even the goal here. I hate to say it, but weight loss is. Okay, that' snot happening either... so maybe it's just .. i like running. Bye.

      Hamstrings have been sore, weirdly. I think I need to do a lot more stretching. Anyway, I'm too lazy to write anymore now. Bye.

      Too hot today. Same run as usual it seems I like to get stuck in patterns. Going to try to find myself a running partner. Not only more fun, but safer to run in twos!   stats  4.5 miles 50 mins 120.5 lbs

      Quads are getting ridiculously sore. Got to stretch a lot more, and throughout the day! I sit at my desk all day and then think i can just up and go running... NOT. well, it rained, but I didn't let a little bit of rain stand in the way of getting a run. Yay.    stats  4.2 miles 50 minutes 119.5 lbs. Yay! (can i subtract the weight of my hair?)

      Well come to think of it, I think the run to the track might be slightly more than a mile, so I'm revising that, even though I ran the exact same distance today as yesterday. Whatever, it's not like I need to be accurate to the point five anyway. Today felt good, slightly sore though. At least I went out as the sun was setting, so it wasn't quite so hot. Yay! Track goes fast, I must say.    stats  45 mins 4.2 miles not going to weigh myself until i can see some noticeable improvement.. sigh.

      Oh crap it's been a long time since I last went on a run.. one thing and another, you know how it is. Well, despite all that (guilt guilt guilt) I had a nice run. In part perhaps because I was well rested... and hydrated and all that good stuff. Yup. Oh, by the way, perhaps the heat has something to do with it as well. Darn heat. I haven't been waking up early, like I was before.. lethargy. Let's hope I can run through July without any silliness! Yeeehaw.    Stats  45 mins 4.2 miles track = 2 miles. oh, and i'm sure i've gained back all the weight i lost, and more. rar!!
