      Yay Stars tied with Philadelphia 2-2 after being down 2-0 for most of the game.  I really didn't think they were going to come back like that but then they did.  Very suprising.  Me, Jess and Britty were all at Brittany's house for our reunion party since she was back from Boston and we watched the game.  There was this one part of the game where there was this totally blatant penalty on somebody....i don't remember now.....but yeah and we sat there and yelled and screamed at the TV for seriously 3 mins straight.  And we started throwing stuff.  Jess threw 2 pillows, a pen and a stuffed animal.  I threw one pillow.  and Brittany just hollered and cussed at the tv.  Then finally, the stupid referee called the penalty and we shutup.  And then the last 3 mins of the game and the entire overtime period, me and jess sat there and yelled at the tv.  Jess is like "i've never seen you cuss this much before." and i was like "obviously you've never seen me at a Coppell vs. Jesuit game".  It was pretty funny.  Ok you know what bothers me?  People who come up to me (and sometimes Brittany) and say "Wow you must really like hockey because *they list all these really dumb reasons*.  You must be obsessed."  And i'm like "oook thanks for your concern".  Yes because i watch hockey games, have a fave player, know all the teams and some of their players, watch school hockey, have hockey in my away messages and profiles and me and some friends have dirty jokes that relate to hockey or inside jokes about hockey at all.....i must be obsessed.  Whatever.  I think its dumb that when you have a fave sport or fave something, people have to diss you for it and call you obsessed.  But then when they have a fave something that they really enjoy....they must not be obsessed.  Psh, its incredibly stupid.  It especially irks me when PEOPLE WHO PLAY THE SPORT tell me that i'm obsessed and that i know too much.  And i'm always like, shouldn't you have more passion than me for that sport because YOU FRICKIN PLAY IT????  Argh, anyways.  Yeah, if you wanna call me obsessed with hockey?  Fine, great, whatever.  Because i've got about 20 other friends who are exactly like me so who frickin cares.  lol, now that i've let off some steam........  Yesterday me, Britt and Jess went to the Vista Ridge mall and it was pretty awesome.  i didn't buy anything, i was proud of myself.  We saw the movie "Cheaper by the Dozen" which was a really funny movie.  And we saw the previews for a hockey movie called "Miracle" which is about the 1980 Olympic USA hockey team who beat the Soviets when no one thought they would.  Lots of hot guys are going to be in it, as we've observed from the previews.  We've decided we're going to see it opening day when it comes out in February.  bye now!  Love,  ~~~Taylor~~~

      Yeah so i didn't do anything today....again.  It appears that everyone's AIM was dying today because everytime i was about to IM someone they would sign off randomly and then sign back on and off several times until they gave up and finally signed off for good.  It was annoying.  Stars won last night 4-3 over Columbus after having a 3 goal lead for quite awhile.  We're lucky we still won without having to go into overtime.  its weird but ever since Brittany left for Boston, Mike Modano (her fave player) and the Stars in general have been playing better.  She missed all of Mike's goals and greatness and she missed Clay Aiken perform on the tv at the Carolina game.  I swear if they start sucking again now that she's back, i am so blaming it on her.  LOL you know i love you Britty!!!  Anyways, today i played Bop It and watched the movies "Little Shop of Horrors", "Legend of Sleepy Hollow" (with the man with perfect cheek bones, Johnny Depp), and "Pirates of the Carribbean".  Me and Brittany had the funniest convo today as well:   ChArLiEsN7AnGeL: i love johnny depp too ChArLiEsN7AnGeL: he rocks LiverpoolFCis1: cheek bonnnneeeeeeesssss ChArLiEsN7AnGeL: lol LiverpoolFCis1: yeah so anyways ChArLiEsN7AnGeL: that's so funny tho...to fall in love with a person...all because of their facial structure ChArLiEsN7AnGeL: it's insane what america is coming to LiverpoolFCis1: lol LiverpoolFCis1: almost insane as falling in love with someone all because of their hair length and color eh? ChArLiEsN7AnGeL: haha ChArLiEsN7AnGeL: right what i was going for  We were both thinking of our boys.......for me, my Niko Kapanen and other people.....and for her, Clay Aiken and other people........LOL Britty, you know who i'm talking about for you and me!   Right so, Siru comes back from Finland in 5 days......and then i get my finnish gum!!!!!!!  yaaaaaaaaaaaaay!!!!  I'm not really sure how to spell it, but i think its called "Jiinke".  Ahh i have the last bag she gave me somewhere in my room.  Spearmint goodness all the way.  Tomorrow Britty, me and Jess are all going to a movie or something as a reunion party for Brittany's return from Boston.  its sure to be fun!  Now i'm going to go to bed because i'm tired and i have nothing else to write. Stars play today....or tomorrow.....whatever day this post is put under, on monday the Stars play Philladelphia (second in Eastern conference) and if we can beat them i'm pretty sure we'll go to number 3 in conference.  So pray that we beat them.  Happy Monday to all,  ~~~Taylor~~~

      right, so after me and jess decided to be unbored and go to the mall, we spent the night at her house.  And we stayed up until 3:30 watching at least 6 episodes of Friends (because she has the first and second season on DVD) and then Pirates of the Carribbean.  We missed the hockey game that night but its ok because the Stars won anyways 2-1 over Nashville.  Anyways, we decided to try and sleep.  Well, the ENTIRE NIGHT it sounded like someone was tapping on Jess' window.  So we were getting all scared and we didn't really fall asleep until 4:30 AM.  I don't know how i made it through today because i didn't have any caffeine ALL DAY!!  Which is like a record for me.  On the other hand, Jess drank like 5 Pepsi's seriously and we ate almost an entire bag of chips and container of salsa......all while watching Friends.  I stayed at her house until about 4:30pm watching Friends and talking.  It was depressing.  Me and Jess discovered that we have more in common with the guy characters of Friends than we do with the girl characters.  Scary.  I hope we don't end up like we did today when we're 30 or something.  So nothing really happened today, Brittany gets back from Boston today AND the Stars play Columbus tonight.  I swear, if the Stars don't beat Columbus.....ack i don't even want to think about it. Ttyl  Go Stars!,  ~~~Taylor~~~

      Allo everyone! i hope everyone had a wonderful Christmas Eve and Christmas Day!!!  I know i did!! Let me give you the recap.  December 24: I had spent the night at Brittnee's house the night before so i went home from that on Xmas Eve.  I got absoutely no sleep the night before because Brittnee was tossing and turningg and snoring and then Tori, who was having boyfriend problems at the time, called at 3am.  So on this day, i was literally staying awake because of the Life-Giving Coca-Cola.  We had salmon for Eve dinner which was ewwww and we were supposed to go to our THIRD christmas even service, but we decided to blow it off.  I couldn't fall asleep that night very well either, but when i did it was midnight.  December 25: My brother woke me up bright and early at 4am because of which i was about to kill them.  I tried going back to sleep by watching MTV at 5am and seeing if maybe my brothers would be a little quieter......no, they just had to get louder.  So i went downstairs, drank 2 cokes and started to look at my gifts from 'santa".  And this is what i got total: * A cool picture frame thing * THREE DALLAS STARS TICKETS!!!!!!  Good seats too, santa creatively gave them to me by sticking them in a mini old timey ice skate.  it was awesome * Bop It Extreme 2!!!!  (Nadia- we are SO having a Bop It party now! we need to get that together!) * Tons of Chocolate, gum, sweet tarts..... * awesome clothes from my parents (they did well this year) * pretty cool makeup (i got some liquid eyeliner that i have no freaking idea how to use considering i use pencil.....) * jewelry * books * Dallas Stars hoodie and shirt * Express Yourself (some game that i have no idea how to play) * Streets of Europe Candle Set (from my brother! he obviously knows me really well! it has the streets of London, Paris, Rome, Venice, and Barcelona.  Its really cool looking and they smell really good) * Money and Best Buy Gift Cards * CDs * new CD walkman with a radio tuner on it * Clinique Happy perfume (thank god, i was running out fast) * PIRATES OF THE CARRIBBEAN ON DVD!!!!!! (oh man, i was going to cry if i didn't get that for christmas) * Ferris Bueller's Day Off on DVD (i swear, if any of you people have not seen that movie you should be shot....and then come over to my house to watch it) * The Breakfast Club on DVD (love that movie!) * Sherlock Holmes Collection on DVD * Sleepy Hollow on DVD (with, his Hottness, JOHNNY DEPP!!!!!) * X-Men dvd set * Grease Soundtrack (finally!) * Finding Nemo on DVD * League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (SCORE! Shane West is sooooo hot in this movie!) * NHL Center Ice Package!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And thats all i can remember at the moment...... So this was a pretty good Christmas, it was awesome.  Except for the part where my brother, Dillon, was shooting me with his arrows from his new bow and arrow set.....thank god it was in the garage where we have a bunch of hockey sticks laying around so i just picked one up and hit him over the head with it.  Haha reminds me of a story where me and Brittany were playing hockey at her house.  So we were playing right and then Brittany started kicking my ass.....she was scoring a goal every 10 seconds! And i got really pissed off because so far i had beat her every game that week!  So she checked me against a wall and that was the final straw, i took my hockey stick, hit her in the back and took her down.  She punched me in the shoulder a few times and kicked my shins.  I fell down and then we were both just kinda laying there and then Brittany's like "My back is bleeding really bad, i need to find my parents".  So we told her parents that it was an accident, which it kinda was, they took her to a clinic and she got a few stitches.  I had no idea i hit her that hard! So now we just laugh about it and we have to wait to play hockey again until her parents say her back is perfectly fine.  Anyways, yeah enough with rambling about pointless stories.....i have to run! bye!  Go Stars!,  ~~~Taylor~~~  P.S. - Stars game today against Nashville, i think.......they better win!  And if they don't, i'll just watch my NHL Center Ice Package!!!!

      Today was extremely boring due to the fact that i stayed home all day.  I can't wait until i'll be able to drive, thank god its not too far away.  Today i got Christmas presents from Chuan and Isaac.  Thanks guys!!!  Chuan gave me a decked out in christmas attire teddy bear!!! Its sooo cute!  And Isaac gave me a shower gift basket that has all this really good smelling body spray and lotion etc.  Its awesome.  Guess what? No Stars hockey for approximatley 3 days now that the christmas hockey break is coming.  grrr.....now what am i going to do to entertain myself?  oh well, its all good.  i discovered that my daddy is getting me the NHL Center Ice package thingie for Christmas for sure now!!!  Brittany- that means we get to watch the Dallas, Philadelphia, St. Louis, AND New Jersey games!!!!  It going to be awesome.  So if the Stars are losing....i'll just change the channel and watch a different team.  I win!  Meh, thats all for today! Countdown List: *1 day (basically) until Christmas *3 days until Brittany comes back from Boston *1 day (basically) until i get to watch my Pirates of the Carribbean DVD *1 day until i get to watch every freaking game in the NHL with Brittany (when she comes back) with my NHL center ice package  Merry Christmas,   ~~~Taylor~~~

      Stars win 3-1 tonight!!!  it was awesome!! Everyone played wonderfully, they were stealing pucks left and right, throwing pucks at the goal, working together.....just like the Stars i used to know and love.  My dad started calling Niko a midget mid-game because he's the shortest guy on the team and he's drastically shorter than everyone else.  Then i reminded my dad that he's the same height as Niko and he shouldn't be talking.  So anyways, Niko was awesome and he didn't turn over any pucks or whatever, i was very proud of him.  Dallas has the #3 spot still, hurrah, we're getting slowly better.  On Sunday, me, Sarah and Kristen entertained ourselves by watching Lord of the rings and making fun of it.  it was amusing yet nerdy.  We have discovered that we are the only ones home for Christmas, so thank you so much to everyone who left the state because now we're resorting to nerdy things to do because of boredom, lol.  Hey Brittany, guess what? Your Clay Aiken Dearest performed at the Dallas vs. Carolina game and you were in Boston and you missed it!!!!  And then Ralph and Razor made fun of Clay Aiken!!!  Anyways, today i had to restock my makeup supply since i was running drastically low and then i had to help my mom cart all of her presents to the UPS store to ship to halfway across the country.  Yeah thats right, she sent presents to our archrival hockey team part of the family up in New Jersey.....the Flowers.  Every frickin year they give us a hard time about how much our hockey team sucks and their hockey team rocks because they've won the Cup 3 times and we've only won it once.  Even though i love NJ to death for saving the NHL from being Disney-ified by Anaheim.....i still hate the fact that they have to frickin rub it in our faces EVERY YEAR.  Thank goodness they aren't coming to our house this year so i won't have to hear them ramble while i'm watching the hockey game about EVERYTHING Dallas is doing wrong....argh.  Don't get me wrong, i love my NJ family to death.....but they get annoying when ALL THEY FREAKING TALK ABOUT is how much Dallas sucks and why they think hockey shouldn't even be a sport down here because we're not worthy.  grrrr.  So anyways.....today was VERY boring.  Oh yeah, i got my Christmas present from Brittnee today!!!  She got me a "tape" coin purse to match my "boombox" purse.  It is soooo cool!!  Then she got me the coolest toe ring EVER, which is red and black and cool looking.  THEN she got me pink and blue socks that say "Boys are stupid.  Throw rocks at them."  She thought they were hilarious socks so she got them for me.  Dude, a thing that would be really cool for xmas is one of those things that looks like a puck hit your car and it shattered that part and it looks like its still wedged into the glass.  I've seen things liek that are soccer balls, golf balls and baseballs.  they're pretty darn cool.  2 more days until Christmas....yaay!  and now i have to go!  Go Stars!,  ~~~Taylor~~~

      Awww man, last night me and Brittnee partied it up.  We made a new word on accident called "Shutever".  If you are ever in the situation where you would like to say "Whatever" and "Shutup" at the same time, do what Brittnee does and combine the two to make the word "shutever".  Lol, i dunno what we were on last night....but it was funny.  We got on the subject of which guy has the sexiest/most beautiful hands EVER.  And we had a winner, but we can't tell you who he is because you probably know who he is.  sorry!  You can bet he's a hockey player though, lol.  We decided that the guys who had the most sexiest/beautiful hand on the Dallas Stars was a tie between Niko Kapanen and Jason Arnott.  It was close, very very close.  Which reminds me, Stars lost last night......argh.  I have to hand it to them that we did try, but we just couldn't get that cursed puck into the net.  The Florida Panthers Goalie needs to die.  So now right when we were just getting past our sucky start to the season and we were #3 in division....we lose and now we're #4, thank god only Anaheim had a game to play and win that night.  If we can win against Tampa Bay tonight......which is an extreme maybe....then we'll get our #3 spot back and if san jose loses their game and we win another game, we'll take the #2 spot.  So basically, our success depends on other teams that we aren't playing at the moment losing and us possibly winning.  New Jersey's doing rather well!!  If they win another game they'll be tied with Phillie, provided that Phillie loses or whatever.    Oh yeah so anyways, about me and Brittnee's sleepover thing.  Remember the guy that was 18 that she gave her phone number to that was the Verizon hick guy's brother and she hardly knew him?  Yeah well he called and was all like "Hey you wanna go to a party?".  Brittnee's like "what do i do?" and she tells him that no, she doesn't want to go because she's hanging out with me tonight.  He's all like pressuring her into going or letting him come over to my house to visit or whatever.  And she's running out of excuses to tell him why she can't go this college party thing.  Finally, she says "i can't go because i have no clothes to wear besides my pajamas" and he says to her "you can't wear none of your friend's clothes?" And i'm sitting there thinking, this guy's a bastard and he's waaaay to desperate.  So then Brittnee hands me the phone and i tell the guy straight up "No, you can't come to my house, she can't go to your stupid party, and i don't trust you because your 18, we don't know you period and you go to college with people we don't know." And i was really close to adding that he was a hick too and annoying as hell and that he needs to learn proper english, but Brittnee grabbed the phone from me before i could get that far.  But then he made her give the phone back to me and he asks "She can't wear none of your clothes?".  Oooh man i was sooo close to yelling at him about his article agreement and english pronunnciation, but i just said ;She can't because our styles are different" adn then i handed the phone back to Brittnee.  She told him period that she couldn't go and that was final but then she asked me if he could come over to my house! i was like "hell no, he can't! my parents are going to be home any minute and if your mom finds out she's going to kill you."  So Brittnee told him that he couldn't do that either and she'd talk to him later that night.  He calls TEN MINUTES LATER and asks her if she wanted to go to that party AGAIN.  She said no i can't, call me later tonight ok.  He ended up calling us SIX MORE TIMES THAT NIGHT.  3 of those at 1am, 3am and 4:30am.  WHEN NORMAL PEOPLE SLEEP even after partying.  So yeah, next time he calls, we're going to tell him to Fuck off and leave us alone.  Hope Mr. Hick Boy gets the message.  Yeah so i have to go now, lol love you Brittnee even though you call guys that are 18 and you don't know!  Go Stars!,  ~~~Taylor~~~

      So tonight i hung out with Brittnee because i haven't hung out with her seriously since september, so she's sleeping over tonight.  We're going to discuss all the boys, girls, hockey games, hockey boys, Niko Kapanen, Dallas Stars and pretty much everything that's related to hockey in some way.  it'll be fun and i'm sure we'll have tons of inside jokes and dirty jokes by the end of the night.  Feel free to talk to us online, because i'm sure we'll be bored soon.  Or you could call me on my cell (214-274-9466) to entertain us.  Especially if you're a guy.  Today was an awesome day....i had little parties in practically all my classes, it was fun!  And i did not get mobbed by a mass group of people today, lol Brittany!  Everyone was really happy today and that was good.  So here's the juicy story of the day.  Me and Brittnee were phone cover shopping for my Nokia and we stopped at this verizon phone booth and these guys were all talking to us and telling us how pretty we were blah blah blah......and then the White guy hick asked Brittnee for her phone number and she was like how old are you?  Guess how old he is?  21!!!!!!  And she goes "Hell no!!!  You're too old!!!".  The Black guy that was helping me with my phone started laughing hysterically.  Those guys thought we were 18.  Yet they must've thought Brittnee was prettier than i was because he went straight for her and completely ignored me.  Yet another thing proving how unattractive i am.  Anyways, yeah so then this hick guy's brother called and we decided to talk to him.  I grabbed the phone and started talking to him.  Turns out he's a hick also so i give the phone to Brittnee.  Brittnee gives this 18 yr old guy that she hardly knows her phone number.  And he's all like ok i'll call you later tonight.  I slapped her and told her that her mom was going to kill her.  She was just like whatever.  Yeah so now she's with me now, reading this and critiquing what i say.  lol, now we're going to watch my Niko play some hockey against the Florida Panthers.....yaaaay!!!  ttyl!  Go Niko go Niko go!,  ~~~Taylor~~~

      Yeah so last night Stars won 3-1 over Vancouver.......it was awesome and i was there! Niko was doing pretty good excpet for this one pass that he let get away that could've been potentially dangerous.....oh well.  CHRISTMAS BREAK STARTS TOMORROW AS OF 2:40PM!!!!!  Thank God, i don't think i could've made it through another day.  And that means Christmas is closer! yaaaaaay!  Siru was so happy about her new boyfriend that she said she was going to get me the biggest bag of finnish gum that Finland had to offer...yaaay i'm going to be set now.  Sarah, Nadia and Nathan all gave me their Christmas presents today!!!  Sarah gave me a MAGIC 8 BALL PEN!!!!  Its going to be ordained by god just like my big magic 8 ball, lol.  Nadia gave me a christmas card that she made herself about Bop-It and Hockey sticks......it was really funny.  Not to mention the SUPER AWESOME socks she gave me plus tons of candy!!  Nathan gave me a little angel ornament in the awesome-est gift bag EVER.  Today sucked until the hockey game which was cool.  I got to see Brittnee, who i haven't gotten to hang out with in awhile.  Then i got to see Marlo which was cool because i haven't seen him in awhile.  Aw man at the game tonight, Brittany said some hilarious things: "I would have said.....Soooo.....when do we get to makeout?" Britt: i'm acting like such a retard Me: well actually that's quite normal for you.... Britt: um...ok.... *40 mins later* Me: my shoes aren't as white as they used to be... Britt: kinda like you!!! Me: What the hell is that supposed to mean? "so in theatre....*looks over her shoulder*....we did this"   Yeah so anyways, Cowboys won 4-0 but i must say this was not one of our better games......I wish TJ had been in tonight, Ozowski makes me uneasy about the agme especially after that game with Marcus when we almost lost.  Scary stuff.  hmmmm ok as much as i would love to keep on writing, i did absolutely no hw tonight because of the hockey game so i need to work on it/get sleep. Maybe i'll just do it in french......i dunno  NHL = non-stop hockey love (lol Brittany),  ~~~Taylor~~~

      Ok this morning sucked.  Let's just say it was feminine complications to spare some uncorrupted minds ok? But 3rd-5th period was pretty cool.  I saw Brittany Dearest on KCBY today!!!!!!  If you see her or have her s/n, say congrats to her today!  She was absolutely brilliant, oscar winning performance.  4th period was pretty cool because we did yoga and i was extremely relaxed.  I was almost falling asleep in 5th period.  Now i love my 5th period class, BCIS I, because Mr. Phillips is soooo funny.  We call him "Phil" for short even though he always tells us to call him Mr. Phillips.  And we all made him laugh today, i haven't EVER seen him laugh.  He doesn't have a girlfriend, its so sad! Me and Kate (my buddy in BCIS) have decided to try and set him up.  See, he's kinda a computer nerd.....but he's so nice! We were daring each other to ask him if he goes clubbing today, but we decided against it.....we'll do it tomorrow.   2 MORE DAYS UNTIL CHRISTMAS BREAK!!!! Oh yeah, and the Stars play Vancouver tonight........pray they win! and i get to go to the game! yaaay! They've been playing better, so maybe we have a chance.  I mean, we beat the defending cup champions, New Jersey, 2-0 and everyone thought they were going to kill us.  We snapped their 13 game unbeaten streak right there.  So maybe we'll do the same thing here.  Allison told me today that me and Brittany are freaking crazy for driving all the way to Duncanville to see a hockey game.  She said she would go but she has to babysit.  i told her we're hardcore, lol.  We're not insane, we just like hockey....ALOT.  and we'd drive anywhere to see it for the cheap price of $3.  Coppell Hockey is pretty good hockey and you don't have to pay tons of money to see them AND they always win, sometimes tie.  Unlike the Stars where you have to pay tons of money to see them play and this season, you pay only to see them lose.  Actually.....i pay to go see Niko......but thats not the point.  My plans for New Years' Eve in case you're wondering, partying it down with Brittany at her house while watching the hockey game, eating and hanging out.  I wonder if we get champagne.....Brittany- can we hook that up?? lol.   Ok i'm hungry, tired and i have hw to do before the stars game.....ttyl!  Go Stars!, Niko Rocks,  ~~~Taylor~~~  P.S. - To the Nikettes 02-03 (Sarah, Liz, Jess, and Me): we need to have a Nikettes reunion tour soon.....party down at all the the Nikettes' houses all xmas break or spring break or whatever and then go to Masengill's house (when we figure out how to get there, lol).  Jess still needs a shirt from Spring Break '03 with Sarah, Liz and Me (Jess there in spirit).  Much love to my Nikettes, the Brittanys and everyone else!

      3 MORE DAYS UNTIL CHRISTMAS BREAK!!!!!   God save us all, i am sooooo tired.  I've started blowing everything off already.  Mythology and Bible test tomorrow, meh....i'll study later.  Oh yeah in other news, the committee thing for the trimester-semester switch STILL hasn't frickin voted on the stupid decision.  They were suppsosed to vote on monday for the ultimate decision but said they needed more time and research before they could.  Apparently, they have to have a decision by February or nothing is going to happen next year.  Pray they put it off until after i've graduated.  Which reminds me, Me and Brittnee made up catchy shirt mottos for our junior and senior shirts.  We made it up tonight on the phone.  Here they are for Class of '06 people:  Junior shirt : '06 Your mom (we want it to be white shirt with plain arial writing for the letters)  Senior Shirt : '06 because.....um.....yeah (red shirt with whatever kind of font) ^We thought they were funny and we actually based them off of some of our inside jokes. Also there is the ever popular "Class of '06!!  we have no spirit!!! wooo!" or "Class of '06 sucks dicks", but i don't think the latter will be approved, lol.    Yeah so Mrs. Cox had another bi-polar spasm today.......she needs drugs i'm telling you! Drugs are the answer! at least for her anyways.  Siru is going to get me finnish gum yaaaay! In "finnish lessons" today during french, she said again i suck at pronunnciation.  Well excuse me for all the frickin weird sounds the finnish letters make! Lol, you know i love you Siru if you're reading this.  In aerobics today, Nadia brought the COOLEST burned cd EVER!!!  It had the Vehicle song on it and "Come on Eileen".  it was awesome.  So now i have the stupid vehicle song stuck in my head.    hmmmm hw calls, to sum today up.....it was a pretty darn good day  Niko Rocks, Go Stars!,  ~~~Taylor~~~

      Yeah so....school sucks and it needs to die.  I am so tired but i just have to keep on telling myself that i can make it through these last 4 days before christmas break..... Siru gave me her program today from her little finnish christmas singing service thing and made me read it so i could get better on my pronunnciation.  Jeez, i start to get a headache when she makes me start to read finnish, so i had to take it home to practice with......not that i know what any of it means but i know its about Christ and stuff.  Siru is going to Finland to see her family and she told me that if i want any finnish gum, i have to be extra nice to her and not hurt her for not liking Kyle anymore.  Man, i thought they were going to get married too!  Meh, there's still time.  Speaking of marriage, i've got 12 people and counting plus my parents thinking i'm going to get married to this one guy....why we're thinking about this now, i have no idea because i'm only 15 going on 16.  But yeah, thats whats going on.  One of my old teachers that i'm really good friends with was all telling me about all these stories where people meet the person they're going to marry at 15-16 yrs old.  It happened to her too.  Her husband now was just a summer fling back then and then she moved away and they met back up at college.  Freaky freaky.  And my Niko's fiancee, he's known since they were 14.  Michael Owen's girlfriend/fiancee (its not final yet), he's known her since they were 6 and they grew up together!  So i guess its possible, but i doubt it.  Meh, its fun to joke around about anyways.    This week i've decided to pretty much blow off everything.  Do my homework with the least amount of effort and study for my tests just a little bit the night before then proceed to cram 10 mins before the test.  I have a bad case of senioritis and i've still got a tri and 1/2 to go of this year and then a whole other year to go before i'm a senior.  Juniors and Seniors now tell you that sophmore year sucks......and it kinda does because you're not planning anything for your senior year (ex: motto, shirts, rings) and you have to worry about GPA/rank and all that stuff.  Its kinda like a boring middle year.    Interesting things that happened today: * i talked to my ex-fling Kevin H. for the first time since June (the month where we stopped liking each other because of the whore he fell for, lol) today......it was awkward but nice and i got to tell him what i really think about his now ex-whore-girlfriend.  It was fun. * I discovered just how much i OWN Nathan Lacey, i feel powerful lol * Brittnee was sick at home today! But it was kinda nice because when i got home, i got to talk to her for longer than usual before she's rushing off to dance or whatever....we don't get to talk as often as we like any more because dance has taken over her life again. * Brittnee told me that i have no confidence and thats why i'm afraid to take risks....i dunno if she's right though.....because i did take that risk when i went up to Sam Parnell and asked him if i could take his picture......and that time when i IMed this certain guy all by myself when Brittnee was away in California.....Yeah what now Brittnee, i have confidence just sometimes i have to draw the line, lol!  And now its time to read up on the spark notes for my mythology book for english! byeeeeee!  Go Stars!,  ~~~Taylor~~~

      Don't you hate it when people get on AIM for 10 mins, go on away message right when you're about to say hey and then freaking sign off? It drives me crazy! That happened to me all week! Oh well, i would like to give a shoutout to Liz Whiting that i love her to death and i'm sorry what i said about the shower, lol!!!  Today, i would like to wish great luck to my Dallas Stars as they take on Chicago for the second time consecutively and i hope they win.  Again, today i did absolutely nothing and i listened to burned cd's all day.  Oh yeah, i had to look over my few words in finnish that Siru gave me to learn because she still wants me to be trilingual in finnish.  Meh, i try.  5 MORE DAYS UNTIL CHRISTMAS BREAK!!!! yaaaaay! For Christmas, i'm staying home, with my family, watching my annual tradition christmas movies such as "A Muppet's Christmas Carol" and "A Diva's Christmas Carol" and then i'm watching the hockey games all Christmas Break.  Don't forget New Year's Eve where i will be partying it down with my friends while watching Dallas go against Montreal.  I have tickets to that game too, but i don't know if me or my parents are going.  I took this quiz today that was how pure you are....i'm 86% pure! woooo!  Then i took this Pregnancy quiz thing......it says i'm going to have 4 kids after i get married, over my dead body i will!  Then i took a slut test that said i was 45% slut.....which i don't really understand but whatever.  Oh yeah, in other news, the forces in Iraq found Saddam Hussein.....whoop-de-doo, now we can waste more money putting him on trial and prolonging this "war" in iraq.  oh joy.    Go Stars!,  ~~~Taylor~~~  P.S.- Me and Brittany are going to be in the hockey section of the yearbook!!!!!  because we were cheering!!! we have quotes and everything!!  yaaaay! our work has paid off, hurrah.

      Hmmm lets see today i did absolutely nothing.....and it felt good.  I had almost no homework to work on, i had nowhere to go, i didn't really want to do anything and i just sat at home.  I sat at home and slept, talked on the phone a little bit, talked online a little bit and ate.  It was good.  Yeah, today was my dad's bday dinner....it was boring and i had to eat enchiladas (blech!).  And BRITTNEE was impossible to get a hold of to tell her something IMPORTANT, but yeah whatever.  Isn't today somebody's birthday?? i keep on feeling like i'm forgetting someone's birthday but i can't remember whose it was.....well if it was your birthday today, December 13th, then tell me and i'm terribly sorry i forgot.  And then i'll send you a bday email card thing and wish you the best of bdays, :)    Omg, i am soooo tired.  I want school to end right now or i want to skip a grade and be a senior wth literally no homework.  I still have to semi-study for that stupid BCIS test.  BCIS is a computer class for those that didn't know.  I swear that class has made me start to hate computer...but then without computers there's alot of things i would be without.    Ok and now, i am going to go eat some of my dad's birthday cake and then go to sleep, no partying tonight.  ~~~Taylor~~~

Oh man it was nerve-racking for almost the entire 60 mins.......jeez i almost had a heart attack.  And my Niko played so well!!!!  All the Stars played fabulously!!!  Now if only we can keep this winning up, we'll be out of last place in no time!!!   Oh man after we scored, i almost blew out my speakers by blasting out the "Ole Ole" song.  And then after we won, i played "We are the Champions" really loudly.  It was fun!!  It reminded me of the last World Cup when i did that.  yeah so anyways......i have extreme happinness right now or in other words, i'm high on hockey!!!  lol, almost like when Brittnee is high on her "lariette designer drugs" (LOL Brittnee!!)  Go Stars! Niko Rocks,  ~~~Taylor~~~

      hmmmm yeah so today i get to go to the Stars game vs. Chicago.....gee i wonder how bad we're going to lose tonight??  2-0? 3-0? anybody want to start taking bets? Oh yeah! today in English we got to help these little first graders with their letters to Santa!!!!  It was soooo cute!  Elizabeth had this little Finnish Kid named Leevi.....he was sooo adorable! He spoke perfect formal english and he plays hockey, he was so cute! Here's how our conversation went: Me: Hey Leevi! Are you finnish? Leevi: No Me: hmmm...ok are you from Finland? Leevi: Yes, i am from Finland.  I am from *random finnish city that i didn't understand* Me: Oh thats nice and you play hockey? Leevi: Yes i play hockey. Me and my friends, i mean, my friends and I play on a hockey team together. Me: Oh do you play for a mini-mite team? Leevi: No, i play hockey on a team with my friends and I Me: um...ook....are you going to play for the NHL? Leevi: No, i play hockey Me: No, but are you going to play professionally in the National Hockey League? Leevi: No, i play hockey. Me: hmmmm ok ~~~~~~ AND then! i discovered that my little first grader girl that was with me had a crush on this finnish kid, Leevi!!  She kept on whispering in my ear about how he's finnish and plays hockey and how she thought he was sooo cute.  of course, it seemed that Leevi was oblivious to the whole thing.  She's a girl after my own heart (lol Nadia and Kendra)!!!  it was so adorable, the little girl reminded me of myself when i was that age.  Oh yes, in other news, Me, Kendra and Nadia planned our weddings in aerobics today....but it appeared that we mostly planned mine.  Nadia is going to have an 80's wedding, how frickin' cool is that! And Kendra is going to have an Asian wedding....even though she's not asian.  And i, evidently, am going to get married on an ice rink to a hockey player.  I'm going to have Dallas Stars colors, ice skates on everyone's feet, jerseys on me and my husband to trade before we do the kiss-the-bride bit and the reception is even better.  You have to remember that this is mostly spawned from Kendra and Nadia's brains with just a little help from me.  The reception is going to be at a hotel with dancing etc and then we're going to have a big Plasma TV to watch the hockey game on, if there is one on that date.  Coasters for drinks will be hockey pucks and everyone who comes gets a complimentary hockey puck.  There will be 3 different cakes: one that looks like a hockey stick, one that's the finnish flag (since Kendra says i'm obviously going to marry a finnish hockey player because of my niko-liking tastes), and one that is a big wedding cake with a little woman hockey player and a man hockey player on top.  Kendra also said today that if i don't marry a finnish hockey player, i'm letting everyone down and crushing everyone's dreams or something.  Hmmm, i'll try my best not to ruin everything lol.  Nadia said she's not coming to my wedding if i don't marry a finnish hockey player thats like Niko or whatever lol.  I got to get to work on that, lol.  Yeah so thats all i can remember from our wild planning of weddings today but it was really really funny especially when we've still got about 10 years before we have to worry.  Oh yeah and i almost forgot, apparently i'm going to drive away from my wedding on a Zamboni that says Just Married.  I came up with that one a while ago with Brittany, but we just revisited it.    Actually today was kinda boring besides aerobics....oh yeah! 4-1 win for Coppell over Flower Mound! At one point we had FIVE FREAKING PLAYERS in the Penalty Box! And alot of our key players too!  It was crap, it all started when Adam Havens ran into this other guy upon which it looked like an accident and then all of the sudden in about 5 mins, one by one, 4 more people were added in.  Me and Brittnee were freaking out.  But what's sad is that we almost scored a goal on them when they had 3 more players than us.  And FM's one goal, i have to give them props...it was a beautiful goal.  Maybe if ozowski wasn't so busy trying to do the freaking splits to save the puck, they wouldn't have scored.  Oh well, we get TJ back next week anyways and then we can start kicking major ass again.  yaaaaay! Go Coppell all the way, let's win State second time straight!!!!  Niko Rocks,  ~~~Taylor~~~

      THE BEST THING EVER from Brittany's Profile:  TOP 10 REASONS TO DATE A HOCKEY PLAYER: 1.They carry big sticks  2.They always wear protection 3.They have good hands 4.They have good stamina 5.They're used to scoring 6.They find holes and every way to put it in 7.They love to go hard 8.They always do good under pressure 9.They love to hit from behind 10.They always like warm-ups  ^^ Those are my top ten reasons, lol  Yeah so the Stars lose to Pheonix 2-1 last night and now i can say officially that WE ARE SCREWED.  We might as well turn in our skates for the rest of the season because its obvious we're not going to get any better.  I mean seriously, if we cannot beat one of the worst teams in the league, i would say we're screwed major.  Although i am VERY proud of my Niko Kapanen, he was playing absolutely brilliant.  He was doing better than any other person on his line except Jere Lehtinen, who is just great all the time.  Shane Doan, the SUPER HOT captain of Pheonix, scored the first goal! He's only 23!  Hmmmm...yeah....so until the Stars are number 3 in the division, i want New Jersey to win the cup!  Coppell is doing great as usual, kicking ass all over the place. I want to go to the game tonight but i don't think i have anyone to go with so who knows.  Also its at freaking 9:30 and i'm kinda tired.   SIX MORE DAYS UNTIL CHRISTMAS BREAK!!!!! And guess who has all their Christmas Shopping done?!?!?!  I do!!!! Let's see.....i get to go to the Stars game this Friday......but i'm sure we'll lose that one too.  I've decided that i'm only going to go to Stars games to support my Niko Kapanen.  He needs support.  I might get out of it somehow by telling my mom i have a hockey party to go to this Friday....Britt and Jess? are we getting together or no? My house or what?......ok gtg bye!  Stars suck, Niko rocks!  ~~~Taylor~~~

      8 MORE DAYS UNTIL CHRISTMAS BREAK!!!! I have to keep on telling myself i can do this.  *tear* i didn't see everyone i usualy see today because there's a freaking flu epidemic going around and people are dropping like flies.  Its almost like the black plague except.....not.  Yeah so anyways, today was boring like most other days except for thursdays because thats hockey night for coppell and ESPN/NHL.  I went to French Club today because my mom wants me to get "involved" so i can go to college.  It turns out that all we do is eat french cookies for 30 mins with all our buddies and talk.  Totally works for me.  Hmmm Roberta gave me a hard time about the freaking Stars losing to the freaking Ducks.....i decided to enlighten her on how Dallas snapped NJ's 13-game winning streak....I still love you Ro!  Oh yes and me, Ro, and Britt decided today that we're going to work for Nokia....or at least i am.  They get all these great holidays, benefits and AWESOME cell phones according to my research.  Yeah so we have assessed that if we move to Finland to work for Nokia we will have perfect bodies, perfect hair, perfect skin and perfect cell phone plans for the rest of our lives.  Does anyone realize that 9:30 hockey games really are VERY late.....i'm always really tired when i get home from one.  oh well, gotta represent (lol sarah).  Mr. Dutton has also decided that i am going to grow up, marry a hockey player and be the only wife in their special team press box suite that is yelling/cussing at the players including my husband to do better.  Oh yeah, which reminds me, the Dallas Stars as of monday are going on some 2 day team bonding trip thing with wives included......i hope the wives lay down the law saying "alright look boys, either you start winning games or you don't get any until you do. and you won't get anything good until you win the stanley cup either".   Thats what i would do and i think Brittany (@Chili's) last night said she would do too.  Hey, you gotta get them going somehow and if taking away privileges (lol) is the only way to do it, then oh well.  Which also reminds me, my Daddy is getting me the NHL Center Ice TV Package thing in which you can watch ALL the games in the NHL!!!!!!  1000 games a week is what the ad said!!!!  I told him i NEEDED to see a winning team due to the Stars recent....um....problems.  He said he understood and he'd think about it which pretty much means its....a....CHRISTMAS PRESENT!!!  yaaaaaaay!  Alright, hw calls and i need to sleep tonight!   F cubed (lol jess and brit), JHAA Member since....um....i can't remember (lol brit), Niko Rocks!,  ~~~Taylor~~~

      HA! i just learned how to login and find stuff. I feel special.  hmmm ok now its time to put a little more about me.  My fave hockey player: Niko Kapanen  Fave NHL Team: Dallas Stars (but they're losing my faith...)  Fave Local Hockey Team: Coppell Cowboys all the way!!!  State Champs 02-03!!!!  Friends: Sarah, Brittany, Brittnee, Nadia, Kendra, Kristen, Taylor S., Taylor K., Jessica, Roberta, Ingrid, Nathaniel, Adam G., Chuan, Adam (freshman), Sarah (freshman), Brittany (freshman), Haley, Jessi, Niki, Elizabeth P., LIZ (The Great One), Harper, Baynham, Garza, Grace, Grace in Seattle, Brooke, Greg, Steph, Sarah C., Lauren, Esmi.........aaah i can't think of anymore but if i forgot you i'm terribly sorry, i'm tired because of school and hockey : )  Most hated player of mine in NHL: ummm....probably the Ricci guy from L.A. Kings, he need to get plastic surgery and donate parts of his nose to Michael Jackson.....and then maybe Jean-Sabastien Giguere only because he got lucky in playoffs last year  The team that needs to die: Last year it was Anaheim but this year it appears its going to be Boston or L.A.  My Fave countries in the whole world: England, Finland (for their HOT hockey players, Jess would agree lol), Germany (only for their chocolate) aaaand......probably Australia  My fave sports: Hockey (duh), Soccer, Rugby, and.....i think thats it  Official Saviours of the NHL: New Jersey Devils for their brilliant win against Anaheim and stopping the NHL from being Disney-ized : )  Fave subject: English or French.....maybe History or Geography  Hated subject: Math needs to die  Last real boyfriend: gee.....i can't remember lol  hmmmm i dunno i think thats it.....and now i have to figure out how to link this whole thing to my profile.  if you're reading this, you know i figured it out.

He's had one for a really long time and it looks like so much fun, so i decided to follow in the Great Day's footsteps and create my own.  So anyways.......nothing terribly interesting happened today.  Mrs. Cox went through another one of her bipolar spasms...i'm serious that lady needs to get on some serious drugs to fix herself.  The Stars suck at the moment because they are at the bottom of their division and NJ rocks because i think they're leading their division or they're number 2.  I dunno whatever.  Hmmm i have nothing else to put here.....i'll put something else when i remember

      OH MAN!!!  FRIDAY NIGHT WAS THE BEST NIGHT EVER!!!  Besides getting out of school like....5 hrs early......Me, Brittany and Jessica went to our first NHL game together and it was Brittany's very FIRST NHL game.  We made these awesome signs but we didn't get on the jumbotron because i think the camera people were lazy.  Here's what our signs consisted of: * Eat More Sharks * Don't Touch Him, He's Finnish! (me and Jess' sign) * Mo, score a goal for me, its my 1st game (Britty's sign) * What now San Jose What now?! * Go Stars! (the generic one) * NHL: Nonstop Hockey Love They were awesome signs.  Very colorful.  My personal fave was the 'Don't touch him he's finnish" one, but Niko was scratched that game so i didn't really get to hold it up for anyone except for Jere.  Oh well.  I would just like to blame Tippett for messing up our night.  First, he sends Antti Miettinen (Jessica's boy) back to frickin Utah AND THEN he scratches Niko.  The only person that was really there was Mike Modano, but i guess that was important since it was Britty's first game.  Then Brittany and Jessica came over to spend the night and we watched the last of the Colorado vs. Anaheim game (in which Anaheim won in overtime) and Paul Kariya is soooo cute!  He's so little and tiny and he skates so fast! Now that he's not on Anaheim, i can think he's cute.  Why couldn't i think he was cute last year? Well if you take a look at my note to Sarah Casey in her yearbook, you'll know why.  I was boycotting the Mighty Ducks and everything Disney with Brittany last year during playoffs.  I secretly thought Kariya was cute, but if i told that to Brittany, she would kill me.  So i waited until he was traded and now i can like him! lol, that was my random story of the day.  Anyways, Brittany's friend called at 2am while we were sleeping and thats why i felt really tired today.  I haven't really done much of anything today except watch movies.    Sports update: Coppell plays Marcus at next game.  And i'm really scared because 4 players (Drinkwater, Habibi, Wszolek, Kukla) are suspended for the next 3 games after that stellar fight against Jesuit people after the loss.  I will never forget that fight.  Especially the part where T.J. came in and was just ripping the guy apart as it seemed.  Dallas also plays Pheonix tonight at 8pm.  Scared about that too, i don't think we've ever beaten them yet.  I dunno i can't remember.  Yeah, so, represent.    I think i'm going to go eat now.....  Go Stars!, ~~~Taylor~~~

      Yesterday was like a terrible nightmare.  Here are the reasons why:  1) My fave teacher in the whole wide world, Mr. Masengill, was falsely accused by this stupid freshman girl that he pressured her into having sexual contact with him.  Its complete bullshit we all know it, but there's nothing we can really do about it.  Some people organized a rally at the police station.  That was pretty cool.  We had signs and we got free mountain dews for standing out there for awhile.  I was glad to discover how many people support Masengill.  But i was still depressed that this whole arresting thing even happened.  2) Coppell loses to Jesuit 3-2.  I sniffled on the way out of the game.  I cried when i got home.  The whole day had been a shitty day and when they lost, i lost it.  It sucked.  And the worst part is that we had a 2-0 lead for almost an entire period.  And then the last 7 mins or so, we cracked.  T.J cracked.  We fell apart.  Jeez, the jeering of those stupid Jesuit people is still ringing in my ears.  I really just wanted to wake up this morning and have us still win the game and Masengill is not in legal trouble.  It was sooo sad.  Man, i can't wait until i can drive.  I will so be staying after next time to kick some Jesuit ass.    There are other reasons why i'm incredibly depressed this week, but i don't feel like typing them out.  Stars play San Jose tonight and me, britty and jess are going to the game.  If they don't win, this week has officially been a shitty week.  Gotta go.  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      Dallas plays Ottawa tonight, represent and watch it.....i think its at 7.  Today was a pretty fun day.  Tom and Jess' first day as a couple.....and i already screwed it up lol.  Not really, i just slipped and said something i shouldn't have.  I was trying to convince Jess that she NEEDS to go to the Jesuit vs. Coppell game and Tom was there too.  Well, usually i use the "hot guy" speech on Jess to make her go and i forgot for a SPLIT SECOND that she was newly un-single so i said "Do you know how many hot guy----yeah nevermind, i'm leaving now".  I was sooo embarassed because i forgot!  I need to call her and apologize.  Oh man what if i do that to her after she's a newlywed, lol! jk, Jess i'm sorry! *tear* i wish i had a boyfriend.  I have a few options, but i'm not going to push it or anything.....i like to be friends with guys before i just run off and date them.  Tom and Jess look so happy together!  I'm so happy for them.  Tom is a cool guy, so i completely approve of this relationship.  Also, in my computer class today, me and Kate were trying to convince Mr. Phillips to get highlights in his hair and then let us give him a makeover to go clubbing in.....in exchange for a 100 on a test, lol.  He was all like "I'd rather appear conservative in the workplace" and i said that being conservative is boring.  Liberal with your clothing and hair all the way!  lol, jk.    Blonde kid with no fashion sense update: Me and Lauren didn't see him in the lunch line today, but we saw him at his table.  ugly brown fleece jacket again.  argh.  We thought he was wearing beige tennis shoes (ew!) today, but upon closer inspection, they were normal light brown, which did match what he was wearing.  He was wearing a bright red shirt with yellow lettering that brought out the color in his pale skin.  Now if only he didn't have that jacket, he would've had a wonderful outfit.....he needs a jean jacket.  oh well.  2 days until Stars game!!!  AND WE MIGHT GET PASSES TO MEET THEM!!!!!!  AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!  Because Jess' Dad is all friends with somebody's wife on the team and Andy Moog and some other people....so he's got the hook-up-izzle.  Omg, if i meet Niko Kapanen, my life is complete.  well besides the going to college and getting married and having a family bit.  but yeah!!!  And yeah meeting Mike Modano would be cool too.....but thats kinda Britt's dream, lol.  aaaaah i'm sooo excited!  I've decided that the song by Don Henley called "All She Wants to do is Dance" is so my song.  Go Stars!, ~~~Taylor~~~

      So i had a math test and a BCIS (my computer class) test today.  I think i did ok on them.  Stars play Ottawa tomorrow night, hope they do well.  2 more days until the SJ stars game!!!!!  And 1 more day until the Coppell vs. Jesuit game!!!!  This week has been so awesome!!!!  On Friday, Jess and Britty are coming over and we're going to make signs for our stars game against SJ (i got those tickets for christmas).  Here are our ideas: * "Don't touch me i'm Finnish! Kapanen and Miettinen are #1!"  * "MMK: Modano, Miettinen and Kapanen all the way"  * some sign in finnish for Niko and Antti, we need a finn to help us with that! * "Whats that cheer we like to hear!? Go Dallas Go Dallas Go!" * "What now SJ what now?" And we had others.....but i can't remember them right now :)   Blonde kid with no fashion sense update: Today he wore a very nice normal blue shirt with white lettering on it with jeans and white tennis shoes.......but still wore the ugly jacket.  I approve of everything he was wearing except the jacket, at least he was matching today.  lol, i don't know whats going to entertain me and Lauren at lunch after the tri is over......this guy is so much fun to people-watch!  he also walks very weird.....i can't put my finger on it, but he reminds me of someone........hmm i'm sure i'll get it before the end of the tri.    And now its time for the friend story of the week!  Jessica VanRiper  Lets see........i met her 2nd tri of freshman year in Masengill's class.  She sat behind me.  When i walked in and i didn't really know anyone except for Sarah and Felipe, i turned around and started talking to her.  She thought i was crazy when she first met me because the first thing i said to her was "Hi my name is Taylor and i like this boy....." and then proceeded to tell her my entire life story.  Jess was like "ok really, i don't know you, why are you talking to me" and kinda weirded out by the whole telling-her-my-life-story thing.  But we continued to talk and we did a project together on Chile.  She came to my house and we became pretty good friends.  In this Chile project, we went clubbing in Santiago, made Jess get really drunk so she threw up on Pepito (our "tour guide"), made me fall in love with Pepito, made Jess fall in love with Pepito's brother, then made us switch lovers, then we went shopping......yeah it was an interesting and twisted project.  We found out later that Mr. Masengill made it to the "clubbing slide" and then stopped reading and gave us a 94.  And i'd always stop at her locker before 3rd period and talk to her and Brittany Pleau (who is now one of my other best friends) before we went to our geography class.  Eventually i had to be moved because i was turning around and talking to her and Liz so much.  But me and Brittany became really good friends and then in turn Jess became one of my best friends.  Now me, her and Brittany are always hanging out together, watching hockey games, having hockey sleepovers, attempting to make a movie but then going to sleep before hand, playing lunar golf ramdomly.......generally everything!  Jess has always been there for me and she's a great person and i'm really happy that she's one of my good friends!  Did i mention that she is REALLY funny when she yells? Yeah, you guys should see it some time! lol, love ya Jess!!!  She's also always there to give me advice on guys etc.  Jess rocks forever! :)  Ok guys, procrastination is wearing off and i need to do my homework!  Love you all!, ~~~Taylor~~~

      hey Dallas ties with Detroit 2-2......totally works for me!  Now we just have to pray that Minnesota can beat L.A. tonight......that would help ever so much.   My Niko was doing pretty well.......i just wish he would get more aggressive and slam people into the glass and stop with the i'm-just-going-to-hook-you-because-i-don't-want-to-touch-you thing.  Yeah.....its ok though, i still love him!!!  Oh man, you guys should see Brittany when Mike does something wrong or the other team scores a goal......she falls on her knees and yells, its soooooo funny! LOL Britt, i just had to say it, but you know i love you!!!!!  Its ok, i did that at Metroplex Championship and State last year for hockey.  Every time Southlake scored a goal, it was like someone stabbed me.  Very much like when Dallas played Detroit and lost 6-2.  So i completely understand your pain.    Raise your glasses to the Stars, for they haven't lost in their last 3 games (i think, don't take my word on that)!  Cheers, ~~~Taylor~~~

      Stars play Detroit tonight.....*prays*.....oh man it would be soooo freakin cool if we beat them, but i'm not going to get my hopes up.  Nothing really happened at school today.  Me and Lauren made jokes about small feet and guys.  it was really amusing.  We also thought of the most perfect all male cast for a movie.  There were alot of winners.  More news on the short pale blonde kid, contrary to what we thought at lunch we later discovered that he was NOT WEARING white socks with slip on sandals.  But he was wearing the ugly jacket AND a dirty white shirt.  But his jeans were nice.  I hope a braver girl than i chooses to tell this kid the problems with his wardrobe......but until then Me and Lauren will discuss his clothing flaws, lol!   Can't wait until the Coppell vs. Jesuit game, it'll be awesome!!!!  Emily (my friend from the Stars games) is coming and this time she'll have to represent for Coppell!   She bet me $100 bucks the other day that i would marry a Niko Kapanen look-alike on an ice rink and name my first kid Niko.  It was really funny.  hmmm i really have nothing else to say...  4 days until the stars game with Britty and Jess AND 3 days until the Coppell vs. Jesuit game!!!!!!!!  Whats that cheer we like to hear? Go Niko go Niko go! (or you could put Dallas in there.....whatever.)  Cheers, ~~~Taylor~~~

      Yeah so last night, the Stars won 3-2 over St. Louis....what now st. louis what now!?!?!?!  I didn't actually watch the game because i was at the movies with Brittany, but i heard it was awesome.  Me and Brittany went to go see Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King at 7:40pm last night.....which meant that frickin long movie thats 3hrs and 30 mins long.....didn't let out until 11:15.  Its ok, i had fun making fun of the movie the entire time....Brittany didn't like that though lol.  Ok the part where Frodo is standing on the cliff thing and is getting ready to drop the ring......yeah that was waaaaay too long of a scene.  He needed to just drop it and be done with it.  But nooooo, this is Lord of the Rings where we have to take 15 minutes to watch a stupid little annoying hobbit sit there and look all evil while comtemplating to drop the stupid ring in or not AND then decide not to AND then get his finger bitten off by another stupid ugly used-to-be hobbit when it could've been SO MUCH EASIER to just shove Frodo off the cliff and end the movie.  yeah.  If only a woman had been a part of the Fellowship of the Ring in the books/movies, the journey to the stupid mountain to destroy the ring would've gone sooo much faster and easier (lol Sarah and Kristen).  Haha oh yeah and after the movie when Brittany was going to call her parents and see who won the Stars game......her buttons on her cell except for one of the pointer buttons and zero DIED.  So we spazzed on the phone because we HAD to know who won the game!  It was amusing.  Oh man, do you know what kind of freaky people are at the mall at 11:30????  Scary people....people with no color coordination.....freaky pot smoking high skateboarder poser people.....*shiver*.  OMG there were all these little 6th graders at the mall at 11:30!!!!  I wasn't even allowed to go to the mall alone in the DAYTIME until i was about 13-14!!!  I would never let my children that were middle schoolers go to the mall past 9, ever.  Its just too dangerous.  I remember thinking that i would let my kids do that when my mom wouldn't let me go to the mall alone......but now i realized that she was right all along and that i wouldn't let my kids do that....darnit! why does she always have to be right about those things!    I also went to church this morning at VRBC, there was this lady with this really ugly pink and blue plaid dress thing on....ew.  The colors were correct for her skin color, but the plaid with the selected colors were ugly.  oh well.  During church, me and this hot guy (he looked hot from far away at least) were....ummm.....how do you put this......catching each others eye?  And we did that for most of the singing parts of the service.  And then i when i got up close, he wasn't really that good looking.  He was actually kinda...ew.....its ok though, he wasn't really my type anyways.  After church, i went to Krispy Kreme with Sarah, Kristen, Kendra and the gang.  We turned in our bulletins from church and got a free donut, it was awesome.  Then we went to Fazoli's and ate alot of italian food......and talked about a funny movie we should make in which someone flirts with the picture of the boy on the coke fountain machine and freaks everyone in the restaurant out and then tape your phone number to the machine.  Don't try to understand, it was funny at the time.    I looked for jobs today and i found 2 online applications.  One for AMC Theatres and one at the Dr. Pepper Star Center in wherever.  I thought about working at Starbucks but i dunno if i could deal with the smell of coffee for that long of periods at a time.  if you have any ideas of where i could possibly work.....please let me know.  Alright, gotta go......4 MORE DAYS UNTIL THE STARS GAME WITH BRITTY AND JESS!!!! YAAAAY!!!  Go Stars!, ~~~Taylor~~~

      STARS WIN 2-0 OVER ST. LOUIS!!!!!!!!!!!!! Miracle of God, i swear. The Stars were nearly perfect and Marty Turco was absolutely perfect and........ NIKO GOT AN ASSIST ON AARON DOWNEY'S GOAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Osgood was not on his game tonight, i'm telling you.   And Niko got in the penalty box for high-sticking double minor!!!!  Thats my boy!!!! He's actually been getting in the box alot this season, he must be getting caught for all that hooking/high-sticking he doesn't normally get caught for, lol.  Thats my Niko!  This is a great night for partying and celebration.  Now me and Brittany are going to go play NHL 99 and win a Stanley Cup.  Rejoice, for the Stars have won against a team they had no chance against!  Go Stars! ~~~Taylor~~~

      yay, Stars play St. Louis tonight......gee i hope we don't lose :( Today was Renaissance lunch.  It was awesome, me and Lauren went to Quizno's.  Very good sandwiches.  Except the lady making a sandwich was being a bitch to everyone, but i guess since hte place was packed and she was kinda stressed, she had a reason.  I swear, there's this guy that works there that i see everytime i go......i swear he looks exactly like Phillippe Boucher.  Except Phillippe might be a tad bit taller.  And this guy's italian or something.  i saw the short blonde kid today, i approve of his yellow shirt and jeans.  jeez, i feel bad that i don't even know this kid and Lauren and I critique his color choice and clothes everyday.  I have discovered that C lunch is the BEST lunch to people watch in.  Seriously, i think out of all the lunches, we have the most interesting and unique people to watch.    It ends up that i'm going to Brittany's house tonight because i made plans with her a few days ago that we would watch this game because she loves St. Louis and Keith Tkachuk and all that......but then again we always watch the hockey games together, its kinda assumed.    Have fun this weekend you guys, ~~~Taylor~~~

      I hope you all enjoyed the friend story of the week, lol!  Wednesday, nothing happened so i'm not even going to talk about it.  Well actually something did happen, but its not like major or anything.  There was this kinda pale-ish blonde kid right and he's shorter than me.  He's kinda cute but he just has some clothing issues that I CAN'T EVER GET PAST.  So that pretty much means that he doesn't qualify as one of the few, the proud, the elite boys to have a relationship with.  Ok lets start with the first issue.  He wears the SAME FREAKING JACKET everyday.  It drives me crazy.  And its light brown, which if you know anything about me, you know that i do NOT like brown.  I have this urge to tell him that he needs to wash the freaking jacket every once and awhile.  Its also fleece which is easy to get dirty.  But thats not even the half of it.  HE WEARS BABY BLUE.  Normally i would not have a problem with this color, but this kid has to light of a skin color for this color.  Pastels make him appear to be washed out and sick looking.  It doesn't look good on him.  Ok next problem.  He wears white socks with slide sandals.  you know those sandals that are those adidas slides things that you can just put your foot right into?  He wears white socks with those.  AND his sandals didn't match a thing he was wearing.  honestly, if you're going to wear sandals in the winter, DON'T wear socks with them.  or you could just be smart and wear closed toe shoes.  but nooooo, he's weird and has to have bad fashion sense.  He walked past me and i was about to scream that a)his shoes didn't match his outfit, b) he was wearing white socks with sandals and c) what the hell was he doing wearing sandals anyways?  I guess i can't really talk, since i've worn sandals this winter, but they were dressy so i didn't have a choice.  Sorry, i know this whole paragraph sounded incredibly vain and spaztic, but seriously, when you can't match things, it bothers me.  Especially when it comes to matching colors to your skin color.   Nathan stole my purse and Lauren told me that i gave him the look of death right then.  i guess i didn't notice.  Nathan was all like "i have learned 2 things today.  Don't ever wear beige or colors that look bad on you because it bothers Taylor AND don't EVER EVER EVER steal her purse....if you value your balls, you will follow this."  It was really funny.  Not that i would ever purposely hurt a guy for wearing beige or colors that look bad on him, but if you steal my purse.....i swear its all over for you lol.  Sports Update: Stars lost on Tuesday to Edmonton 3-0, first shutout EVER for Edmonton against Dallas AND we gave up in the 3rd which was sad.  You can't say they didn't play well though.  Coppell plays Mansfield tonight in Duncanville and me and Brittany are coming along for the road trip! Starts at 6;30, come represent.  And now i have to run, hurrah for 3 4-day weeks in a row! one week until me, Brittany and Jess go to the Stars game!!!!  Look for us on tv, we're going to get on that jumbotron if it kills us. :)  Love,  ~~~Taylor~~~

      So on Monday, me, Brittany and Jessica went to Vista Ridge Mall and played Lunar Golf for about an hour.  It was fun.  Brittany had the golf thing going on and was making all these hole in ones and then me and Jess were all playing hockey with our golf balls until they got into the hole.  I made mine skip out of the mini golf thing several times.  The lady there was sooo mean to us, she cheated us out of 2 more games and made us pay more for our glowy necklaces.  Argh.  Then there was this REALLY WEIRD guy at the fajita place that was all hitting on me and Jess.  it was weird.  I thought the reason he talked really slow and had a weird accent was because he was foreign......no it turns out he's from Arkansas.  I should've known.    Sports update: Stars win over Vancouver (a frickin 9:30 game) 3-2.  It was awesome, Niko and Antti rocked the house.  I watched some of the Colorado game before the Stars game and Paul Kariya was sooo cute! He's so little!!!  Now its time for the friend story of the week!  Sarah Casey  Yeah so we met over the internet because she was a friend of my friend, Haniya.  She was also dating Harper Weaver at the time which i thought was REALLY ODD.  We always talked about Harper etc and for the longest time i thought she was a year younger than i was.  i remember this one time, Harper wanted to send her flowers while she was on vacation in washington or something......and i spent hours researching and helping harper.....and then he got her a TEDDY BEAR!!!  Oh well, good times.  Me and Sarah officially met at the PSAT (we're such nerds!) where i was so tired from staying up until like 4am at a friend's house, that i was completely out of it.  I remember it was our break during the PSAT and i was staring at the school song on the opposite wall.  Then i started asking myself and Sarah, if our school was really on a lofty hilltop.  Sarah thought that this was just the funniest thing ever.  lalalala we became good friends.  We ended up having geography together second tri which was like the best tri EVER.  We had sooo many jokes in that class and most of them were rather inappropriate.  if i tried to list them all, it would take weeks.  Most of them were about Finland, Masengill, Hockey, newsboys.......and generally everything else.  Can i just say D lunch 2nd tri!?!?!  i can just say that Sarah was the person that cheered me up when things got really down.....usually with something really dumb that would make me laugh.  She was also sort of the voice of reason whenever my pessimistic side came out.  I love Sarah to death and she's always been there for me when i needed her most and she always listens to my dramatic and embarassing stories.  Baptist-palooza!!!! LOL!!!  We always joke around about who we're going to marry which generally ends up in insanity......yeah.  i love my Captain Casey!!!!!!!    Go Stars....even though we're losing as i write this.....  Love,  ~~~Taylor~~~

      Last night, Stars beat Calgary 3-2.  I feel really bad though because after the second perod when after we were doing so well and we started losing because Calgary was up 2-1.....i didn't watch the 3rd period and i went to sleep.  And then they went off and won.  Oh well.  Stars play Vancouver on Monday, so that should be interesting to watch considering they're losing to teams they shouldn't be...*cough sanjose cough*.....but yeah anyways.  Niko was doing great!!!!  Oh man last night was awesome.  They put Niko on the tv before commercial then they showed my FAVORITE COMMERCIAL of all time (the Coors Light Wingman commercial) and then when they came back to the game Niko was on the TV again!!!  It doesn't get much better than that folks.  I officially love ESPN and Fox Sports Net.  Mike Modano did rather well considering his "groin injury" from his "strenuous" skating.  whatever, he did alright.  I know i don't talk about football often.....more like never....but here we go.  The New England Patriots and their EXTREMELY HOT quarterback, Tom Brady, (oh god save me, i think a football player is hot) are going to the Super Bowl.  That report was made especially for Brittany Pleau, being the proud half Bostonian and half Canadian that she is.    I didn't really do anything today.....except watch my mom book our vacation over spring break to Williamsburg, Virginia.  oh joy.  Brittany says its an awesome place but i'm just mad about how my mom picked that option over the MUCH COOLER options we had.  Lets see our options were: Finland, Norway, Sweden, England, Ibiza, Spain, Minnesota, New York, New Jersey, France, the Carribbean......and she picks frickin VIRGINIA.  aaaaaaaagh! oh well, whatever.  At least there's no hot guys in Virginia, lol.  i might be going to hang out at someone's house tonight, but i dunno......ttyl  Love,  ~~~Taylor~~~

      Yeah so on Thursday, the Stars lost 4-1, just as i expected.  Niko did really well though!!!!  He was on ESPN for 2 whole minutes because he almost scored a goal!!! And then they were all talking about how great he was.....it was awesome.  i was so proud of him!!!  And his hair looked beautiful and blonde as usual.  Except now i'm confused on the colors of his eyes.  Me and Brittany debated on this before we left for the Coppell Hockey game.  They're supposed to be blue but i think they're actually more of a grey or blue-grey.  And when they did a close up on his face, they were grey but from far away they look blue.  So confusing.  Meh, Stars still suck but Niko rocks.  yay.  Tonight we play Calgary and i think we'll win this one, but lose our next 6 and then win our next 3.  Those are my predictions.  Go Stars.  Coppell played Highland park also on Thursday and i have to admit it was a much more intense game than i expected.  Last year, Coppell would beat HP 6-2 every game.  And now all of the sudden HP had a chance.  They got close, but we were one step ahead of them.  Cowboys played pretty well, there were a few passing problems and a few unfair penalties from the refs.....but thats the usual.  Some brilliant hits from Ashcon, Jimmy M., and Adam Havens.  At least i think it was them.  I don't really know because Brittnee's so tall and she was in my way for most of the night, lol its ok Brittnee i still love you!  My friend from HP, Emily, who i know from the Stars games, came and we had alot of fun.  She really hit it off with Brittany and Jess because all 4 of us are hockey fanatics and all.  George Lesner had to be the gay bastard he is and make fun of Emily because she was from Highland Park.  he was just saying crap to her and it really got on my nerves.  But its ok, the Brittanys, Jessica and I got onto his case about it and he shutup.  Agh, how much i hate him and his gay un-color coordinated clothes.  Susan was also getting on my nerves because she kept on giving me her "dissapproving looks" when i was cheering for the team.  And Emily Drinkwater was being more loud than i was and was flicking off everything that walked.....mad props to Emily D., her antics were very amusing.  AAgh, if you don't like hockey and you don't like people cheering/supporting the team, then don't frickin come.....we don't want you there anyways.    After the hockey game, i went to Brittany's house with Jess and we spent the night.  It was fun and we actually went to bed rather early (2am) considering that we usually go to bed at like 4am.  And i didn't sleep past 12 for once, i got up at around 9:30 - 10.  Weird.  Then we laid on Brittany's bed for about 2 hours singing really loud to All-American Rejects and other songs that were on the cd.  We went to PetsMart and bought stuff for Britty's horse and then we went to Souper Salad to eat healthy.  Then we decided to come to my house and watch Coupling, this absolutely brilliant British comedy that i have on DVD.  We talked to people that were online for about an hour and then we watched the entire first season and half of the second before we passed out on the floor from sleep.  i don't even remember half of the jokes we made, i think i got amnesia from........i don't remember.  But yeah, they were funny when we made them.  Brittany had to leave at the crack of dawn (9am) and Jess and I decided to lay there for about an hour and not be able to understand each other's english.  After Jess went home (after playing about 30 rounds of BopIt, lol), i went to another friend's house and worked on/finished a project.  Yay, now i'm homework free.  Oh yeah, me, Jess, and Britty decided that we're going to do a rotation of houses this weekend.  Our last stop is Jess'.  That's the one where we take pictures.  And then ONE MORE WEEK UNTIL OUR STARS GAME TOGETHER!!!!!  We've already decided that the day we go (which lucky for us is the day we get out for an AC/DEC competition, which my dear Sarah Casey will be performing in, GO SARAH!!!!!) we're going to come to my house, make signs before the game, and then they'll sleepover.  yay.    I'm tired of writing, ttyl!  Go Niko and maybe the Stars, ~~~Taylor~~~

      Nothing really happened today......it was pretty blah.  4 day weekend!!!!!!  YAAAAY!!!  Saturday, i have to work on this stupid phrase project.....argh, i hate projects.  I have to go to my partner's house at 11am!!!  I love my partner, but i don't like the 11am part.....oh well, i'll live.  Today, my pen ran out of ink and i had to bring my Magic 8 Ball pen to school and in all of my classes we were asking it life questions.....it was amusing.  Adam Hartwick, in Geometry, was SO FUNNY!!!!  The kid acted like he was on drugs but it was hilarious.  He was making up magic tricks and showing them to us and i have no idea why it was so funny but it was.  He was bugging the hell out of me and Cheryl and we told him that we liked him better asleep, but he just kept on annoying us.  he's usually REALLY quiet, but i guess today he decided to be outgoing.  i don't know how his girlfriend puts up with him.    Tonight is a hockey game at 9:30 vs. Highland Park.  Yay.  Here's the group that's going: Me, Brittany, Brittnee, Jess (if she's not babysitting), Emily (friend from the stars games), and Lauren (if her parents will let her).  You should all come, its bound to be fun!  Stars also play tonight against Colorado.  Personally, i think we're going to lose.  But ya know, the Stars always seem to find ways to surprised me when i seriously think their screwed, so who knows.  Game time for that is 8pm on ESPN.  That means i get to watch the Stars possibly work themselves into a pit for about a period and a 1/2.  Oh well, i must support Niko because he doesn't really have anyone else.....except for maybe his fiancee.....who nobody, especially me, cares about.  Brittany - we need to sick the Canadian Mafia on her immediatley, lol!  Happy 4-day Hockey/Hangout Weekend!  Cheers, ~~~Taylor~~~

      ok i forgot, i wanted to put one last thing in.......i've decided to copy Nadia and put in a friend story of the week/whenever i decide to update.  Sorry Nadia!!!  But your idea was such a good one!!!!!  I'll just say that this is copyright Nadia Kudsi 2004.  Ok here we go!   Brittnee McCutchin   (Freshman Year) When i first saw Brittnee, i thought she was a complete bitch/slut.  I knew she was in my Biology class and i remember this one time where i asked her a question and she totally blew me off.  At this point, i decided she was a popular bitch person.  Well this one time, i think we were in this group for some skit in Drama and we had to work together.  She was talking about this guy that she thought was the hottest guy she'd ever seen.  I asked her who it was and she said she had no idea.  Well, she described him and i figured out that it was this guy who was an ok attractive person that had been stalking me since the second week of school.  She said that he knew he was a hockey player though.  And i was like "OMG that is so totally my stalker".  She thought this was really funny and we became friends.  As the tri went on, i told her who i had a crush on and she finally saw him one day and gave her approval.  We discovered through reliable sources that this kid that she liked so much was canadian and throughout this passage we will refer to him as "Randy Andy" (LOL Brittnee!!!!).  We called him Randy Andy because he checked out every and i mean EVERY girl that crossed his path.  Well horny doesn't really rhyme with anything and so we adopted the brit word for it called Randy and rhymed it with Andy.  Anyways, we discovered that the guy i liked (who will be referred to as Maraccas....LOL again Brittnee!!) and she liked were good friends and therefore in time we became BEST FRIENDS.  We also both discovered that we thought Niko Kapanen (finnish guy on Dallas Stars) and Brenden Morrow(Canadian guy on Dallas Stars), people from Canada and Finland, were hot.  So began our friendship and the Finland-Canada obsession, LOL Britt!  We did literally everything together, but at that time she wasn't in dance anymore.  We went to the last half of the hockey season for Coppell which was about 12-15 games to support my hockey player and the team (because i liked hockey and brittnee liked the hot guys, lol JK britt love ya!)and for Brittnee, to hopefully see Randy Andy.  We went to one JV Black game to see Brittnee's Randy Andy and it was free so i didn't have a problem with it.  We became part of "The Original 10" which we refer to ourselves and the other 8 students that came to the games before Coppell won State and all.  We were there when Coppell acquired their first ever loss at Metroplex and when they won State.  I swear we banged on the glass so hard, that our hands were bruised and we yelled so much that our voices were gone for 2 days.  Blah blah blah blah time went on and we still had our crushes.  And she was always there for me, giving me advice, telling me to shutup when i was overreacting and calming me down after she told me to shutup.  She helped me overanalyze things to endth degree and we had and will continue to have good times together.  Oh man we have so many dirty jokes about our boys, its not even funny!  She was still there for me after what happened last summer and was there for me after what carried on throughout the year.  She was there for me on my dates, was even at my house for one of them LOL!!!   She always makes me feel better and whenever i needed her most, she's always there to bring me out of my stupidity and depression, lol.  So that is the story of how me and Brittnee met and became best friends.  Just think, if it hadn't been for those guys that we liked so much we would have never been best friends!!!   And thats the friend story of the week.....Brittnee McCutchin.....I LOVE YOU BRITTNEE!!!! LOL, remember the finnish chicken and the canadian cow, the Lariette designer drugs, shortness, IMing, 2010 Winter Olympics Vancouver, hand in the pocket......and all the really funny jokes we had!!!  Good times!!!

      Yesterday nothing really happened.....EXCEPT THE STARS WON OVER SJ!!!!!  That was soooo awesome!!!  3-0 win over San Jose.....they made them look like a terrible team.  it was funny, everyone i told today had the same reaction to the Stars' win.  i'd say "Stars won 3-0 last night" and they'd say "Really? Who'd they play?" and i'd say "San Jose" and they'd be all surprised and say "WHAT!?!?!  WE BEAT THEM!?!?!"  It was amusing.  Yes, the Stars actually won and did not lose the win in overtime or just flat out lose.  Niko was rocking the house and so was everyone else!!!  Rob DiMaio had to leave with an ankle sprain in early 2nd period and i dunno if he's going to be back for tomorrow's game.  It was greatness.    Today during lunch, Me and Lauren....well actually it was more like me......were all talking about/staring at this attractive blonde guy a person in line behind us.....it was fun.  he was the same guy that i saw when i accidently walked into my 3rd period class when it was mentor period.  That whole mentor accident was embarassing...but yeah anyways.  I made eye contact a few times with this guy.....but meh, he's short and no offense to short guys but i like tall-ness.  And his hair is wavy blonde and not straight blonde like Niko's....so yeah, kinda turn-off-ish.  Then we discovered that this girl that is the blah girlfriend of this guy that we think is really hot.....lives across from Lauren!!!!!!  So now we made up plans of some how to catch her hot boyfriend on tape, LOL jk! We're probably not really going to do that, but it was really amusing at the time to joke around about.  Oh guess what!!!!!  I may not be going to Lubbock anymore!!!!!!!!!!  YAAAAAAAAY!!!!  Thank you God!!!!  I REALLY did not want to go!  Coppell plays Highland Park tomorrow at 9:30.....bound to be a win because we ALWAYS beat them.  The Brittanys and my friend Emily (from the Platinum Club seats at the Stars game) are all coming!!!!  It'll be tons of fun!!!  if you want to go but don't have anyone to really go with, call me/IM me and you can sit with us!!!  Can i just say that the coverage for the Coppell vs. Duncanville game was TERRIBLE.  Brittany, i know you warned me, but i didn't think it was going to be that bad!!!  And to any Coppell Hockey players that might be reading this, seriously guys, step it up.  Every night, especially against people like Duncanville, it should be 9-0.  I know you guys have it in you, lets go!   Wish you all the best over your 4-day weekend, ~~~Taylor~~~

      Lalalalala nothing really happened today.  I had some of my theories disproved and then i made up a new one.  Right so me and Brittany had this theory that all finnish people have perfect skin and zero acne......and every finnish person that we've seen/met.....which is a grand total of 6 including the one finn that disproved our theory, has met these requirements.  So we see this new finn and he's got just a slight bit of acne....he's not terribly bad looking but....yeah.   So this guy kills our theory of all finns have perfect skin.  So we don't like this person very much, lol.  I'm not going to say his name etc to protect his innocence.  Yeah but then we made a new theory that out of the 6 finns we've met only one had non-perfect skin, so therefore 1 out of every 6 finns must have non-perfect skin and yet therefore again, our theory still lives.  We were happy.  We made this up while eating at Quizno's after school today.    If you haven't heard already, i'm supposed to go to Lubbock, TX on Friday and come back on Sunday/Monday.  RANDOMLY.  There is absolutely no reason to go to Lubbock this 4 day weekend except for the fact that my parents want to see their Alma Mater University again and they want me to see it too.  They said i could bring a friend, but no one is able to go because they're busy.  I'm not even going to Texas Tech or any Texas School for that matter so why should i go see this school.  I think they're just worried i'm going to leave the country or Texas, so they think by showing me the Tech campus, its somehow going to make me want to stay in this state.  No, thats ok, really, i'll go to Michigan thanks.  Or New York.  And then i'll transfer to somewhere in Europe for gosh sakes.  But i'm not staying here.  Here's the good news though, my dad is thinking about cancelling the trip!!!  YAAAY!!  Thank god, i don't want to go at all!   And i'm pretty sure we're not going now, but who knows.  I hope my mom will just get over it and not fight it.  Whatever.  Stars game tomorrow against San Jose.  Eeek.  We need to win this game really bad.  I mean, really bad.  As of right now, Pheonix is beating us by one point (i think, if they haven't won) and SJ is beating us by about 6.   If we can get past Pheonix....i think we'll be ok.  We're number 9 right now.  i hope and pray they'll make it through.  if we don't make it in the playoffs this year, i think i'll cry and i'll be crushed.  And there are very few people that can comfort me at that point.  Brittnee knows, with experience from when Coppell lost to Southlake Carroll at Metroplex 5-1.  Oh man, i cried at that game.  Brittnee was threatening to take me home and i told her i didn't care and blah blah blah.  My dad and the other Brittany know with experience of when the Stars lost to Anaheim last year in the playoffs.  Yeah.....you don't want to know, its bad.  Please please please please let them win.  Oh yeah, and i haven't heard anything or whatever, but i'm hoping that Niko will make it into the youngstars game at the all-star weekend....he's still in his first 3 years of contract, so i think he can still qualify.    Right so, i'm going to go to bed and i wish you all the best of luck of getting through  this week before the 4-day weekend.  Oh yeah, and tomorrow is Orlando Bloom's birthday.  He'll be 27, so wish him the best 27th birthday silently in your head or tell everyone about it.  I declare Orlando's bday as Official Worship/Drool-Over-Orlando-Bloom Day.  So participate.  Cheers.  17 more days until me, Britty and Jess go to our first Stars game together!  Love,  ~~~Taylor~~~

      Right so last night, me and Brittany watched "Coupling" and talked about problems.  She was kinda having fights with her parents so she came over to sort it out and also hang out avec moi!  We made some really really interesting jokes.....but it was amusing.  Another update in sports!  Coppell Hockey beats Duncanville 5-0.  OMG the Duncanville moms were frickin crazy!!!!!  They were like screaming everytime one of the Duncanville players got within 3 ft of the puck!!!!  Psycho hockey moms, very scary.  Coppell could've played better though, i was kind of dissappointed in them.  Duncanville's defense was really solid though, but their goalie sucked so it didn't do them much good.  Duncanville had some hot guys on their team too!  Of course that was on Thursday while there was also a Stars game going on which i believe we won 2-1......Ilya Kovalchuk was scaring the hell out of me because i thought he was going to tie it up any second.  Stars did pretty good in that game.  I also went to the Stars game today against Colorado at freaking NOON!!!  No one plays hockey at noon!!!  I don't even get up at that hour!  Anyways, i went and the stars kinda sucked the first 2 period of the game and we scored a goal that got taken away for 'Goalie Interference".....which was SO NOT!!!  The goalie got himself tied up with his own players and one of ours and then Guerin went around and scored and then they didn't count it and put him int he box for Goalie Interference.  I'm sorry, but it is not our fault that the Colorado goalie is that stupid to get himself tied up with his own players plus one of the Stars.  So yeah.....the refs officially made it onto my hit list at that moment.  I felt so much extreme hate for them at that moment, it wasn't even funny.  Oh but it gets worse my friends.  Then they started calling penalties on people WHO WEREN'T EVEN CLOSE TO THE PERSON THEY SUPPOSEDLY DID SOMETHING TO!!!  They called one for just skating by one of those Colorado people it seemed like.  It was terrible, i wonder how much the refs were paid.  They kept on calling slashing when nothing happened.  I think the Stars are lucky though that Teemu Selanne was hurt and didn't come back after second period.....he would've scored some serious goals with Milan Hejduk, Peter Forsberg, Tanguay and Paul Kariya (my personal fave Av, I couldn't like him last year because he played for Anaheim and me and Britty were boycotting Anaheim/Disney during playoffs).  But in the 3rd period i think we finally decided to get our asses in gear and we scored 2 goals.  So we didn't go down without a fight.  OMG but Tippett pulled Turco with 2 mins and 30 secs left!!!  Me, Emily and Lauren (the girls that are my friends that sit next to us) were freaking out like "What the hell are you doing!!! You're not supposed to do that until the final minute!!!".   I swear those 2 shots at the goal when Turco wasn't there......Miracles of God.......The first one was a little bit of a long shot but it got close.  The second one though.....omg.......it was going straight for the middle of the back of the net.....and then all of the sudden it did this little movement where it decided to go left.......and it missed the goal by literally AN INCH.  It was absolutely nerve-racking.  Me and Emily started freaking out and hugging because God had just saved the Stars from an even more embarassing loss.  If you saw on the TV or live......you will agree that it was a Miracle of God.  Anyways, we still lost and there were alot of penalties that should've been called on Colorado but never got called.  Stupid refs.....reminds me of the Coppell vs. Southlake Carroll game in Frisco this year.  That reminds me, Southlake Carroll has lost THREE TIMES this season so far....they must've lost alot of awesome players last year due to graduation etc.  Last year they were undefeated until they lost to Clear Lake in Semifinals for State which completely sucked for them but was good for us.   Omg at the stars game also, there were these stupid guys that sat in front of us and made fun of me, Emily and Lauren and their friends that were with them.  Lauren spazzed on them by asking if they were Stars fans and then when they didn't answer she was like "Yeah thats what i thought".  They were so ugly too!  They were slightly overweight and completely undeniably american.....and painfully ignorant of hockey.  I finally was like "Hey! Shut the Hell up or go home!" and then i wanted to whisper under my breath "Go eat some nachos or something...overweight bastards" but then the Stars scored so i was distracted.  Sorry, i know but i was really mad.  Emily thought it was really really funny.  They were saying they were going to "beat the fucking shit" out of us anyways so we did have to kinda defend ourselves.  Emily was all like "Jerkoffs, don't come to the games anymore.  We didn't come here to listen to you mock everyone".  Yeah....i almost hope they come back so i can yell at them and stuff.  Thats all i got, bye now!  Much Love,  ~~~Taylor~~~  P.S - Niko rocked at the stars game today, yaaay!  And he was on the cover of the program thing!  Hurrah!

      meh french test tomorrow.....i can study in the morning.  Today went by pretty fast.  Have you ever had that feeling of how you REALLY wanted to talk to someone like right then, but then they weren't online and there was no way you could reach them by phone?  Yeah i had that feeling today.  It sucked.  Coppell plays tomorrow and Dallas plays Atlanta tomorrow.  Joy.  I hope Niko scores a goal when i come home.  That would be great.  It would totally brighten my next couple days.  I get my late christmas present from Nathaniel tomorrow!!!!!  Yaaaaaaaaaay!!!!  I think its a cd of some sort, but i dunno!  I'm excited.  Hmmm lets see what else can i talk about......Oh yeah! My 13 yr old 7th grade brother started shaving his face today.  I dunno why, its not like there was any hair to shave......but whatever, its his face and skin.    Je ne veux pas travailler, Je ne veux pas dejeuner, Je veux que l'oublier, Et puis, Je fuis. ^ part of our song we have to learn in french...don't know if i put all the words in though....  Happy Hockey Thursday to all!,  ~~~Taylor~~~

      Today i decided that i just don't like school.  I don't want to go and i don't want to study and i don't want to do homework.  Not that i really study or do my homework at home anyways.  I like school only because i get to see all of my friends and we get to do stupid things in front of everyone and we don't care.  Meh, i have a Bible test tomorrow in English......French sounds like the perfect time to study for that.  Coppell Hockey starts back up again this Thursday where we play Duncanville at 6:30 in Valley Ranch.  Bound to be fun, at least they can win games and not tie at the last second like the DALLAS STARS can.  Dallas plays Atlanta on Thursday at 7:30 or something.  Meh, who really cares because i'm sure we'll have the win until the last 30 seconds of the game and then we'll tie.  So no point in watching until the last minute of the game.    Monday was boring, Today was boring.  As long as school is going on, everyday is boring.  Except the afternoon/early evening when i talked to Brittany on the phone.  We had this huge debate over whether Clay Aiken was gay or not and all the proof we both had of our opinions.  Then that turned into this huge "Would you pick this guy over Mike Modano" debate in which Brittany would give me Mike and another choice and expect me not to pick Mike.  Well i picked Mike against Clay, Ashton and some other guys.  And the she tried matching up Prince William, Andy Roddick and some other really hot guys up to Mike.  At some points, it was really quite unfair to Mike, especially when the Prince William vs. Mike thing came up.  Everyone knows that any girl would pick Prince William over Mike because A) He's the hottest guy ever much less the fact that he's a ROYAL hot guy, B) He's rich, C) he's blonde, D) he had the coolest mom ever and E) He's Prince William for gosh sakes! and he's internationally loved.  If Prince William died tomorrow, the world would literally stop and every girl would cry her eyes out.  You thought the world stopped when Princess Diana died?  It only stopped for a few hours.  If Prince William died, the world would stop for a few days (LOL Brittany, that was a great debate).  That's my opinion anyways.  So that was the fun thing of the evening.  Also, Brittany revealed something that made me freak out, but its ok now.  I would also like to say to Taylor Kubic that i am now mad at him for more than what he said to me today and the game thing, so if he values his life he will apologize fairly quickly.  Ok and now i'm going to go.  bye!  Best of luck to your first week back at school,  ~~~Taylor~~~

      I swear the Stars are revolutionaries for losing the win when they've had it for most of the game.  TWENTY ONE FRICKING SECONDS!!!!!!!  Those stupid L.A. people had a goal.  First we score the beginning goal, then L.A. scores before 1st period is over.  THEN we score another goal and we hold the win for almost the rest of the game.  UNTIL the last 30 SECONDS!!!!!  at 21 seconds left in the game, the L.A. people score and it was a terrible goal that i personally think Marty could've blocked.  Oh man, you should've seen the players on the bench's faces.  Niko looked like he was about to kill someone, Zubie almost broke his stick, Mattie looked like he was trying to convince himself it was all a bad dream, and Jere looked like he was about to cross the ice and hit Marty over the head.  I would've hit Marty, probably yelled at him alot too.  I'm sorry, but at this moment in time i think Marty Turco sucks at life.  And of course that game ended 2-2 in overtime.  Well, at least we played better than we did on Friday where the under-30 team called Pheonix kicked our asses major 6-0.  I was at that game too but i left early.  I weep for the Stars.  So i haven't really done much of anything for the past 2 days except eat, sleep and watch hockey.  Oh and i did homework for a little while, but i've decided i'll just finish it in French 1st period.  Wish you all the best of luck trying to get up for school tomorrow,  ~~~Taylor~~~

      Despite Brittany being just a tad bit sick, we had a great New Years' Eve.  She came over and we watched the Dallas vs. Montreal game.....that game pissed me off, i swear.  It was one FRICKIN MINUTE until we won and got a shutout......ONE MINUTE.  And that goal was a terrible goal, it was so easy for Marty to block.   AAAAAAAGGGGHHHH!!!!!!  Oh well, yet another TIE for us.  At least we didn't lose.  So the game ended 1-1.  After that, me and Brittany watched the MTV New Years Eve Party which was kinda boring for a little while....until they had this free style battle of champions thing.  One guy was named "Reign Man" and the other guy was named "Wreckonize", and they were all battling for the world title or something.  Anyways, "Reign Man" was kinda funny but a little mean and so was "Wreckonize" but then in the end, "Reign Man" was really mean because he started rapping about how W's father left.  It was awful!  So me and Britt went to MTV.com and voted for "Wreckonize" 20 times.  And he ended up winning so we were happy.  Then we watched the ball drop and we toasted with Coca-Cola.  We then decided to tape ourselves getting ready for 12 o' clock.  We were REALLY dumb.  We weren't even drinking alcohol and we were acting like we were drunk.  So when the clock stroke 12, i broke out the sparkling grape juice.....oh man don't drink too much of that stuff, it wires you.  We were spilling it everywhere and i was chugging the last bit of the bottle.  And we have this all on tape.  AND we were dancing.  Then we went outside and popped poppers and mini firework things.  And then we toasted to the Pacific coast.  Then we drank some more sparkling stuff and we went upstairs to watch my favorite british comedy that i now have on DVD, Coupling.  If you have never seen Coupling....omg you need to see it.  It enlightens you on the differences between boys and girls.  Its hilarious.  Yeah so anyways, today, i'm probably going to do nothing and then eat black eyed peas for good luck.  Love you all, hope you had a great 2003 and an even better 2004!  Happy New Year,  ~~~Taylor~~~

      Discipleship Now was awesome, our host family was sooooo cool!  I had to leave early because i got sick with sinus infection or something.  Road Rally was awesome, i discovered that the mighty Minivan can do anything.  The sophomores were the last group to finish the race.....while everyone else finished around 12:30 we finished at 1:45!!!!!  represent, the night was still young!  then we went to sleep and said some things we couldn't remember.  Here are some quotes from that incident:  Kendra and Kristen: *talking about something* Me: Ok guys thats great now go to sleep     ^ i don't remember saying that!  Me: you guys its after 8:30 Kendra: no its 8:15 Me: no you guys seriously, its after 8:30 i swear Kristen: no! its only 8:15! Me: noooooo i'm telling you.... Kendra: do you have a clock up there or something? ^ lol you kinda had to be there  anyways, the speaker was pretty good....although he was VERY blunt and i didn't agree with some of the things he said, he was pretty funny.  Also, for our service project, we took out 6th graders to dinner and hung out with them for a little while.  Wow, 6th grade girls are obnoxious....i don't ever remember being like that.....i dunno, anyways, they talked about their boyfriends and blah blah blah.  I talked about my 5th and 6th grade relationships to them and how kinda retarded they were.  I don't understand, these 6th grade girls all have these boyfriends and they're all kissing on them and stuf......and then i have no one!!!!  what is wrong with this picture!!!???  haha oh well.  In me and Mary's car, we listened to the Spice World cd by....yes, the one and only....Spice Girls.  They vaguely remembered them while me and Mary sang along to the entire cd.  I will still openly admit that i love the Spice Girls and if they ever have a reunion tour, i am so going to that!  lol anyways, here are some other jokes from Dnow:  Me: and then he's all like "so have you found any new guys" in the lunchline in front of all these people! and..... Mary: you should've said "no i haven't, have you found any new guys? because the girl your dating sure does look like one!" Me: haha then i was all like "no, i think i need to go to a new state or country because Coppell has no selection" and then he says "oh yeah well i know somewhere you could go....blah blah blah and the guy blah blah blah" and then i'm like "Yeah well we're friends now so there..." Nadia: oh yeah! you should've said "oh! we have a relationship because we're friends with benefits now!" Mary: wow nadia! its getting a little steamy up in here! see, i have all these great comebacks that i never get to use ^ all of us on my ex-crush that was on the retreat  Nadia: he obviously said that because he needed a little self-confidence boost before he went to bed.... Me: yeah so he could fly solo.... Nadia: HAHA ^haha girl talk  "I invented this new device called a B.R.A. or Breast Retaining Appliance" ~ Kendra  Kendra: *puts arm over nose* look, i'm David Day!  Sports Update: so stars won on friday 3-1 over Minnesota,  Coppell won 5-2 over Grapevine and i discovered what bitches some of those hockey sluts are.  Allison was being so mean to every slut that walked by, it was sooo funny.  She was on a roll on saying stuff behind their back or loudly enough so they could hear it.  Then she decided to tell us sex stories she had heard about the hockey players......did i want to know? not really.  I refuse to believe some of them because i like pretending that some of the really cute ones that i have absolutely no chance with aren't the manwhores that she described that use girls and get girlfriends to keep around just for sex.  ugh and then she told us this stitches story....yeah i'm going to have nightmares for awhile.  Stars play Edmonton today at 2pm in which i am going to that game because my mom can't find anyone else to go with......even though i'm sick, she's given me some medicine and told me to go anyways. not that i don't want to go or anything, i just don't really feel up to it. its ok, i'll get to see my Emily and Lauren and we'll all have a good time drooling over our fave players like we always do.    Alright i gotta rest up now since i need to make myself better for the game.  hurrah for the new and last tri, ~~~Taylor~~~

      Aerobics and BCIS exams were easy.  Go teachers! Grades that i've found out so far: French: 97!!!  who's bilingual now!?!?!  (LOL Siru! "We're bilingual now! oh wait...you're trilingual because you speak finnish....") Geometry: 90 and a 91 for the tri!!!! now if i can just get an A in english and not let that exam screw me over, i'll be ok.   BCIS: high A for sure Aerobics: low A, high B because i refused to study  I leave for Discipleship Now this weekend with Sarah and the gang.  Its going to be extreme......i can't wait to do the Road Rally!!!  I'm sure we'll come back with tons of nasty and hilarious jokes about everything.    haha Brittany, i decided to archive our famous song about the NHL:  The Hockey Rocks Song by Taylor and Brittany Tune: Ontario Sucks by the Arrogant Worms  I love the ice smell and the 3 blue lines too, I love the drunk fans that act like they're at a zoo, the ticket prices are high, the ice is clean,  the seats are cushony, and the waiters are lean. And the players are smart and the referees are dumb, and some of the ice rinks look like a slum, the cokes are diluted, and the coaches are dorks. Some teams are really bad, like up in New York Because Hockeeeeeeeeee-eeeee-eeey rocks! "Yup actually i think i love everything about hockey." "Yup me too." I love the puck and the hockey sticks, the skates, the pads and the arena's nice bricks. The jerseys rock, the playoffs rock and the Cup plain rocks and the game plain rocks... I took a trip to Canada to visit Lord Stanley. He introduced me to my fave players and made me happy as a bee. I went to see the Mighty Ducks  and hit Giguere in the head with a puck! I mean, i dunno how it happened but i was using colorful langauge at the time... And Anaheim sucks! Hockeeeeeeeee-eeeeeeee-eeeey rocks! "yup, now that i think really think about it, i think i hate every gosh darn team in the NHL." "But not Dallas!" "Oh yeah, definitley not Dallas! You got your Niko, your Mo, your Brenden and Jere...." I hate Anaheim because they're supposed to suck and Detroit's jerseys are ghet-to. Calgary's team has not hott guys and Vancouver only has one hott goalie. Edmonton plays dirty and it makes me mad, Hockey rocks, Hockey rocks. Montreal's jerseys have too many letters on them, isn't that frenchie?? The Maple Leafs are boring anf their players are old and as for Saskatchewan.....they don't have one! "I mean, even Manitoba has a minor league team....." But Dallaaaaaaaaas is number one! and Anaheim suckssssssssssss!  ^ haha good times in Algebra 1, freshman year, third tri Britt!  You guys have to realize how incredibly BORED we were in that class....ah, the best of our brilliance came out of that class sometimes!  lol, alright gotta go finish packing.  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

Math: again, painfully easy  Tomorrow's predictions: Aerobics: there shouldn't even be a freaking exam for this class BCIS: excel part will be a little challenging, power point will be easy  Right so, i should be studying before i go represent at the hockey game tonight.....but i'm not.  Oh well.  Coppell vs. Grapevine tonight at 8pm.....take a break from studying and come support.    I just need to tell all the people in my classes that i'll miss after this tri:  French: i'll miss you Peteria, Xena, Kendra, Siru, Alex, Kate, Ani, J-P, Kristen, JoBeth, Jessi!!!!

      THE TAKS MUST DIE!!!!!!!!!!!! Those stories were SO STUPID.  They didn't even make freaking sense!!!!  Here is a critique of each of the stories:  "Sunny Days and Sunny Nights" alright first of all, this story had no flow.  the author was constantly going from past to present to future....AAAAHHH STAY IN ONE TENSE!!!!!  She's all like "i went on this date with Alan and then i went on a date with John but thennnnn i realized how much i want Sunny but my dad is all like.....".  ok....what?  If Sunny asked you to marry him and then he goes into the Navy for a little while.....and then you date other guys while he's gone?!?!?!?!  Isn't that considered adultery in an indirect way!?!?!  Did Sunny know about these little rendez-vous?  This story really did have potential but then it just got crappy.  Was the fried chicken symbolic? I could kinda relate to the author's story, but not really.  Plus, the Sunny guy was really REALLY corny.  No offense, but what guy is just like "Hey lets name our kids!"....none that i know of in contemporary american society.....not even really in the entire world.  I dunno about you guys, but a surfer dude does not sound appealing to marry.....even if he's been in the navy and especially if his name is HAROLD.  I liked the blonde hair part but not the surfer and always tanned part or the california part.  I think that Alan guy had the right idea with "pale is in" because i'm pale, i've never been tanned and i'll never be tanned.....so this is why i go for pale blonde people who like the cold......and this is where the hockey-ness comes in because its cold.....surfing is ok but its not my fave thing in then entire freaking world.  yeah ok i'm going on a tangent here, next critique  "Newcomers to a Uncertain World"  Ok, the title had nothing to do with the freaking story and the entire story was just a bunch of random little paragraphs.  it starts out with this girl talking about how her 4-year old son realizes while he's drawing his own name that the letters of his mother's name are also located inside his name. Does anyone else find it weird that this lady's son calls his mother by her first name and not by like....i dunno...."MOM"!?!?!?  Then she goes on to talk about how she hated her name for the longest time until she was sitting in her best friend's sister's car and she looks at some neon green sign and is like "hey actually, my name rocks".  Then she goes to this restaurant in San Antonio meets this guy who she decides is her future husband and just so happens that her friend that she's with knows this guy and introduces them.  Then she starts rhyming things with this guy's last name, Nye.  then she goes off on a tangent about how all the Nye's in America get together and talk.  Now honestly, what people do that if they don't know each other.   Then she's like "hey lets have a dinner party in which all the Nyes in San Antonio come over and we'll hang out and become the best of friends".  Yeah so then all these Nyes and people that she DOESN'T KNOW and for all she knows could be STALKERS or AXE MURDERERS come over for dinner.  The end.  I dunno about y'all but if i got some random invitation from some lady that i don't know, i'd be just a tad bit frightened as to how she acquired my address and name.  Ugh that story had no point and the worst diction and grammar i've ever seen!  TOO MANY COMMAS!!!!!!!!!!  Ok and i am done now. Thank god the English TAKS is over.  I don't know if i could've taken another pointless story with no flow again.  Nothing really happened today because i was in TAKS.  Me, Brittany and Jessica went to Quizno's and talked about relationships and first kisses.  It turns out i have had my first kiss, i just didn't count it on accident! yay! next on the agenda is to get a boyfriend and from the looks of things, its not going to happen very soon.  Anyways, Jessica was counting how many people she's made out with and she kept on getting mad because she couldn't remember one of her 7.  I was like shutup, i've got zero on my list and then i quoted our fave show by saying "go me, i'm an impregnable fortress" (don't ask) and then Brittany shouts "haha! I'M FULL OF SPERM!!!!" (she was also quoting our fave show).....the guy who was working at Quizno's was sooooo confused.  It was soooo funny.  Then we went to Starbucks to "study" in which we just talked to these other people most of the time.  I had a near death experience by choking on my coke because jess or britty or something made me laugh.  I couldn't breathe i swear and i had everyone in the Starbucks watching me to see if i'd die or not.  Then every 5 secs after that, Jess would ask me if i was dying.  It was very scary.    Hmm i think i'll procrastinate studying just a little longer.....  Best of Luck on exams!!!, ~~~Taylor~~~

      Today i had to go home after 3rd period because i felt so sick.  The only reason i went to school today was because i had a math test.  I also feel slightly depressed but i think its because i'm sick.  The math test was easy.  yay.  ok i'm going to eat and then go to sleep now  Cheers, ~~~Taylor~~~

      The weekend recap:  Friday: i made an oscar winning movie called "The Nationality Rangers" and i watched the "prom video" Saturday: i saw "Miracle" for my third time with Sarah, Nadia, and Kendra.  It was awesome!!  We did this running commentary on the facial expressions of the people in the movie, it was amusing.  For example: "that coach's eyebrows just scream communism" or "i am communist [by the way i look at you!]".  Kendra now officially claims Jimmy Craig, Nadia with Mac and Sarah with Dave Silk aka Silky.  I still got Rizzo and Brittany still has OC.  lol, going to that movie was so much fun, we have to see it again Sarah!!! Sunday: I saw "Miracle" with Brittany for what will be my 4th time because Brittany wants to catch up with me on how many times we've both seen Miracle.....lol!  I will beat you Brittany! the competition is on!!  Sports Update: Dallas beat Anaheim 4-0 tonight, brilliant play throughout the entire game.  my Niko was kickin ass!!!!  Coppell plays Grapevine this week at 6:30, i think.  I realize its finals week, but you guys, come out and support.  Look what happened when we didn't go to Euless?  They lost.....badly.   So please, let them all know that we're still here for them, even though they sucked last game......i'm going, who's with me?  My Finals Schedule:  Thursday: French 3 PreAp (i'm going to miss you Siru, Alex, Xena, Katie, Jessi!), English 2 PreAP (i'm going to miss you Cameron, Niki, Boah, Charlie, Kevin, Adam, Dana, Elizabeth!), Geometry (i'm going to miss you Cheryl, Rachel, Rajha!)  Friday: Aerobics (i'm going to miss all you guys!) and BCIS (i'm going to miss you Kate, Nathan, Luther, Matt, Freshman in the back corner!!!!)  Alright, gotta go!  Best of Luck in finals, ~~~Taylor~~~

      Oh man, i just got back from making a movie with Kendra, Kristen, and Nadia called "The Nationality Rangers".  It was sooooo funny.  Basically we're people from different cultural backgrounds who joined together to defeat the Evil Chairman and his Evil Teapot.  I was the Finnish girl Wayne Gretzky, Kendra was the German Keg Drinker, Nadia was the ghetto Bronx girl and Kristen was the Ultra Smiley Spanish person.  I was also the voice of the evil chairman.  If i tried to explain it to you, you wouldn't understand, so i'm not going to waste my time.  you just have to watch it.  We also watched this video of our whole group going to prom and it was acted out in the form of barbies.  I went to prom with a guy that lost his leg in a freak hockey accident, LOL  DALLAS WINS OVER COLORADO 5-1!!!!!!!!  WHAT WERE THE ODDS OF THAT!?!?!?!  My mom told me that my Niko did so good tonight (i didn't watch it because i was making a movie) and i'm so proud of him!!!  WHATS THAT CHEER WE LIKE TO HEAR? GO DALLAS GO DALLAS GO!!!!!  Wow this made the whole day seem alot less crappy.  Alright, sleepy time now.  "I will defeat you with my hockey stick of justice and my icy puck of truth!!!" (lol kendra, nadia and kristen!!!)  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      I GOT AN ASSIST TODAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  SO AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   i played hard and i only fell down like 3 times.  i didn't really knock anyone over today like i did yesterday but it was cool still because MY TEAM WON 6-5!!!!!  WITH A GOAL IN THE LAST 15 SECS!!!!!  Thats right, we rock.  Actually i fell down once pretty hard and landed on my chin, i was afraid i lost a tooth for a sec.  I had to count my teeth, lol.  But they were all there and as i was getting up all the guys started FREAKING OUT like "OMG are you ok!?!?!?!" and i'm like "I'm frickin fine get out of my way, lets play." Still annoying that they did that everytime.  And they kept on going "Are you ok sweetie?" or "are you hurt babe?" or "sorry about that" every time they checked me or ran into me or if i just frickin slipped!!!  aaaaaghhhh when i am playing hockey, I AM NOT A FRAGILE LITTLE GIRL THAT IS GOING TO CRY!!!!  I feel no pain, i just get up and keep on going.  This is the partial reason why my knees are so messed up from the past couple days.  This whole week was pretty awesome.  Sometime next weekend, i'm going to go to the ice rink and practice crossovers etc.    Sports update: Coppell lost to Keller 9-1.......i'm not going to say anymore.  Dallas plays Colorado tonight, $5 they lose 4-2.  At least i get to see my Paul Kariya and Niko Kapanen on the screen at the same time.    Alright, i'm done here, i need to go put ice on my knee and i'm going to kendra's house soon!  Have a good weekend!, ~~~Taylor~~~

      today in aerobics, we played hockey again and i met this really hot guy from Spain named Julio....yeah he can skate and play really well.  i was on an all guys team. And my knee is still really REALLY messed up. In fact its so bad that i have to wrap it in ace bandages to keep it cushioned and kinda semi-straight because its so bruised it hurts to bend it.  But, like a trooper, i still skated/played on it, i just wore a kneepad over that one knee.  Our team lost 5-1.  did i mention that our team yesterday won 5-2? Eek. Omg there was this stupid kid that could NOT skate.....and i'm serious, the kid didn't know how....but he seemed to think he could so he played.  He kept on getting in the way and falling all over the place.  Actually a few times, he was in my way of getting the puck, so i pushed him/knocked him over so i could get it to my hot Spanish teammate.  AND i dropped my stick one time and this kid, Diego (i think), was running off with the puck so i went after him and took him down!!!  And he's 6ft tall and all buff!!!  I was proud of myself.  Ugh but it was so annoying, everytime i tripped or fell or ran into someone, all the guys were like "Oh are you ok!?!?!" and come over and try to help me up....even guys that weren't on my team! i just pushed them out of the way and yelled at them to stay after the puck and not worry about me.  its like they thought i was all delicate/fragile and that i was going to break or something or cry.  Um, hello, but i'm playing on a badly bruised knee thats killing me and you think i'm fragile??!?!?!?  Argh, oh well.  It was kinda nice when i ran into the hot guy and he held my hand to keep us from both falling and spoke in his nice spanish accent "Terribly sorry, will you be alright?".  *sigh* oh well, i don't think i really have a chance with him.  My yelling at people and cussing probably scared him and he probably is extemely intimidated by me.  Also maybe my tolerance for pain (i was being hit every 5 secs by guys and bopped in the face with sticks etc.) will intimidate him also.  Meh, no big deal.  Argh, now every muscle in my body hurts and i have so many bruises and scraped....but i look so athletic and rebellious now!!!  I look like a hockey player!!!....somewhat, lol.   Sports Update: apparently the Stars won last night 4-3 over L.A.....amazing!  Britt said they did really good after the first period.  Coppell plays Keller tonight in Euless, go go Coppell Cowboys!!  I know you guys will kick ass!!!!  I will not be able to attend *tear* but i'll definitley be there next week!  Friend Story of the week!!!:  Lauren Caldwell  Haha this one is a good one.  Lauren was this girl in my PreAp Biology B class with Mrs. Terry.  She was quiet and i never really noticed she was there because i guess she never talked lol.  After the first couple weeks, i noticed that whenever me and Brittnee would make jokes about "our boys" or whenever i said something stupid, Lauren would always laugh at me.  I can't remember what it was but she was laughing at me again and this is pretty much how we introduced each other.  I walked up to her when we had free time this one day and said "Hi, my name is Taylor and i've noticed that you've been laughing at me every time i say something funny.  I think thats awesome and all, but whats your name?".  Seriously, me and Lauren talked about this and we think thats about how it went.  So after that, Mrs. Terry made us lab partners (i think it was because she was trying to separate me and Brittnee, lol, but whatever it worked for me) and we had to disect worms.  Well, as a child, i was scarred for life by watching this one Goosebumps episode (early 90's represent) where this kid disected worms and stuff and eventually this big mama worm came and took him away and treated him just like he had treated the worms.  *shiver* scary stuff.  So now, Lauren is all poking at the worm and i'm freaking out while she does it....and then comes my famous line...."DON'T SCREW WITH THE WORMS MAN!!!!!!".  When i said that, i had to reveal my entire fear of worms to the class.  Oh yes and after that every dissection project was quicly followed by "don't screw with the crawfish man!!!" or "don't screw with the squids man!!".  Lol, don't forget the crawfish Angie and Lauren!!!  Then there was the part where we dissected a crawfish and i'm yelling at Angie not to screw with the crawfish and then she pulled the freaking claw off and Lauren and me are freaking out screaming "YOU SCREWED WITH THE CRAWFISH MAN!!!!!".  yeah, good times.  Even after biology, me and Lauren were still tight.  She was always there to help me with my guy problems and listen to my rants.  She is one of the funniest people i know and i know she'll always be one of my good friends!  Now we brave the perils of lunch together and stalk the blonde kid with no fashion sense!!!!  Good times, i love you forever Lauren!!!!  ** Next week is so Liz Whiting, the Great One  Gotta go!  Love,  ~~~Taylor~~~

      Hey everybody, whats crackulatin'??  Nothing has really happened this week except in Aerobics.   First day of skating.  It was awesome.  I picked up crossovers really fast and i can skate pretty well.   Second Day of skating: worked on skating backwards, Kendra helped me.  I'm getting there slowly.  Also i picked up my left crossover pretty fast considering that right is my best one.  3 Today's Skating (third day): SO FRICKIN AWESOME!!!!!!!!  First i was doing really well with the warm up skate and i didn't hve any problems with crossovers.  Still couldn't skate backwards.  But i found out that i can go really fast and do crossovers, yay for me.  The coolest part of the day, WE PLAYED HOCKEY.  And i wasn't that bad, considering that i've never really played with people my age(except Brittany), especially 6ft guys and i've only played with my brothers.  I was center for a little while and i almost scored a goal but then this stupid guy knocked me down.  So this kid that knocked me down, a freshman who thinks he's all big and bad at hockey, is all skating like he's all that and a bag of chips.....so i had this grudge against him for the rest of the game and i kinda went after him.  I took my stick and kinda hit him and he was all like "hey! you can't do that" and i was like "Do you see any refs?" and i skated off.  After that it was kinda like a rivalry.  I decided i needed a break to catch my breath so i wanted the next shift to go on, which was these 3 guys.  I'm like "Hey! Hey Guys!" because i don't know their names.  They weren't listening to me and it pissed me off, so i threw my stick down on the gym floor and said "HEY LISTEN TO ME!!!  GET UP GET ON THE ICE!!!!  NOWWWW!!!!!" and i threw my stick into the stomach of one of those guys and skated off, cussing.  The guy was all like "Ok! i'm going!".  Mrs. Brinkman was all laughing at me and was like "Are you ok?" and i'm like "I'm fine, i'm just really competitive".  She said she couldn't tell lol.  Then these stupid guys forget that there is now NO GOALIE to keep the other team from taking the win, at the time we're beating them 1-0.  So i have to take the goalie spot because no one else will.  So i run out there and realize i have no stick and there's that stupid freshman coming up fast.  It was almost like a movie because Nadia's all like "Mercer!" and throws me the stick, which i catch.  And this guy is coming and he tries to poke it over the line and it doesn't go, so i dive and place my stick in the way so the ball doesn't go over and make this WICKED AWESOME save with my legs flying in the air, just like Marty Turco.  Then this stupid freshman pushes the ball in but moves the post, which we all know is illegal and makes the goal invalid.  And he's all like "Yes i scored a goal!" and i'm like "Hell no you didn't!".  He protests and says that he did and i'm like "You moved the frickin' post and if you've ever watched hockey in your life, you know that makes the goal not count so therefore you did not frickin score a goal."  He continued to protest and so i chewed him out until he gave up and said it wasn't a goal.  Mrs. Brinkman was all like "You tell him!".  It was amusing.  I let in one goal and i started hitting my stick and banging it all over the place.......why? because it was that stupid freshman that scored on me!!!!!  Oh well, i made some other saves, but my first one was the best.  I've never played goalie in my life, but i wasn't bad at it.  I was all slashing with my stick at every player's legs that wasn't on my team, so awesome.  Oh man, but i totally screwed over my knees.....they're black and blue with scrapes all over.  I didn't have any pads to really dive with but i had to protect my goal!!!!  Thinking about pain wasn't an option!!!  So now i have to wrap my knee, take some Motrin and wear kneepads while looking like a nerd because we're playing outside and if i mess up my knee anymore, i'll probably dislocate it or something.  Hopefully, i'll be able play tomorrow.   Blonde Kid with no fashion sense update: HE GOT A NEW JACKET!!!!!!!!  AND IT LOOKS GOOD ON HIM!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Its a nice blue jacket and it matched his white shirt and everything was matching and was the correct color for his skincolor.....i was so proud of him.....and then Brittany pointed out that he was wearing white socks with blue slide on sandals!!!!!!  HE WAS SO CLOSE!!!!!  At least his sandals matched his outfit, you have to give him props for that.  Keep on Blonde kid, one day, your day of perfect fashion will come.    Ok thats it, new friend story tomorrow probably!  I am a hockey player!!!!! (lol britt, kendra, nadia), ~~~Taylor~~~

      Hey kids! guess what, i did my homework at home and i studied hard for a test for the first time in my life, go figure.  Nothing really happened today.....or the day before that.....or the day before that.......oh well, right now life is boring because exams are coming up or whatever  Sports Update: Stars lost on Valentine's day to Pheonix (i love Shane Doan he is sooo hot and i think he got an assist!) 3-2, Stars lost to the frickin Anaheim Ducks 3-1.  Wow this sucks.  Coppell plays Keller in Euless at 9 frickin 30 pm.....and i can't go *tear*, i really wanted to see us kick Keller's ass too.  oh well, i'll just hear about it later.    Blonde Kid with no Fashion sense: He returns!!!!!  yaaaay!!!  i loved his shirt today, made his eyes stand out, very nice choice for him.  I'm afraid the ugly jacket still lives too because he wore it today.  ok but his shoes did not match his shirt!!!  They were light beige (aaaah i hate beige!) and he's wearing BLUE.  Ok....no.   If you're wearing something brown/beige (*shiver*) then its ok to wear beige shoes, but not when you're wearing blue!  aaaaagh!!!  His shoes didn't even match his jacket!  Lauren wasn't here today, so i had to critique this kid all by myself.  Lauren, if you're sick get better!!!!  Nathan was making fun of me because me and Lauren always "stalk" this kid at lunch.  Kendra finally saw the blonde kid today and we've been looking for half a week, she said he looks like he's clueless to everything.  Nadia still has to see him though!   lalalalala i have no homework........and can i just say that Marlon Brando (the actual actor, Sarah lol) is REALLY FREAKING HOT in the movie we're watching in English, Julius Caesar.  I mean seriously, the boy is fine.  Too bad that movie was made in the early 50's and he's like.....70 years old now.....*tear* oh well, me, Boah and Niki have fun drooling over him.  There's this one part of the movie where he has no shirt on....so hot! lol, ok i'll stop now....  Best of Luck to all getting through this week....i know i'll need it.  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      oh man last night at Jessica's was hilarious.  we had to be on drugs we didn't know about i swear.   we were laughing and saying things that were so incredibly stupid and made absolutely no sense!  it was soo much fun!!!  AND IT SNOWED TODAY!!!!!!!  THIS IS THE BEST DAY EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!  and it wasn't crappy snow that doesn't stick or whatever or is really slushie ice......it was serious snow that was coming down like crazy!!!!  i've never seen this kind of snow EVER in my entire life!!!  I made huge snowballs and parts of a snowman.  Then i had a million snowball fights!  I made the biggest snowball ever with Brittany, it was soooo awesome!  it came down for a really long time!  me, Jess and Britt met up with Sarah and Nadia and we took these 2 little 8 yr old boys down!  we threw all these snowballs!!!  aaah it was so cool!  i tried to play soccer while waiting on jess to come out, but it didn't work out.  I got so much snow down my coat!  This is officially the best day of the year so far.  Stars play Pheonix tonight at 7:30, thank god there's hockey on valentines' day.  Otherwise i'd be sitting at home feeling sorry for myself and wishing there were some really hot guy around to keep me company.  AND i have girl scout cookies also!  I've decided that my Valentine this year will be Niko Kapanen, since i don't really have one.  Brittany's going to come over and watch the game/hockey movies with me tonight while Jess babysits and possibly comes over also.  Cookies + Hockey + hockey movies + friends = awesome day!  Happy Valentines' Day!!!!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      oh man, i am going to kill my geometry class (except cheryl, rachel and the girl that sits next to rachel) because they are all soooooo annoying and they always piss Mrs. Cox off just to be pissing her off.  And then she won't answer questions on hw or anything.  argh.  Sports update: Dallas tied 4-4 last night with NY Islanders.  Brilliant game, i got up early this morning and watched the highlights on NHL.com.  The goal that made us tie by Bill Guerin with 6.2 secs left in the regulation....absolutely brilliant.  Coppell beat Flower Mound 4-1, awesome game.  I also went to the Lariette show thing and the dancing was sooooo awesome!!!  Brittnee McCutchin (one of my best friends!!!) did her solo and she was sooooooo good!!!!  I was so proud of her!!  Her dress was beautiful and her dance was great.  Sarah Gautille, captain of the Lariettes, was also awesome.  It'll be a sad day when she graduates and leaves the Lariettes.  She's the one that brings it all together.    I won an award today from Liz Whiting!!!!!!  I was the recipient of the great "Finland and Hockey Award", lol.  I made an "acceptance speech" and everything.  THANK YOU LIZ FOR THE AWARD!!!!! I LOVE YOU FOREVER!!!!! lol,  good times  And here are my plans for the weekend:   Friday:  1. go see Miracle for my third time (maybe), 2. go to Jess' house and spend the night  Saturday:  1. go to rental store and rent hockey movies (ie Slapshot, Mighty Ducks), 2. go back to my house, 3. Britty and Jess come over, 4. Watch Stars game, 5. watch hockey movies  Sunday:  1. church (blech! i don't want to go, i'll be tired!), 2. rest/hw  And for the 5th year in a row, Valentine's Day will suck......oh well, i'll live just like i did last year and the year before that and the year before....  Go Date-less and Boyfriend-less people!!!!  Represent!!!!  Cheers, ~~~Taylor~~~

      nothing happened today......zero.  Except that we got this really gay homework in geometry that made absolutely no sense.  oh well, its not like i'll really complete it all the way.  Oh yeah and today in BCIS, i lost the ability to read and understand english.  Yeah thats right, the language i'm thinking of majoring in when i go to college, i forgot to understand.  So i gave up and turned off my comp.    I'm worried about the blonde kid with no fashion sense! i haven't seen him for 2 days, i wonder if he's sick! aaaah there's nothing to do in lunch if he's not there to critique!  oh well, i hope he gets better.  I MADE A 103 ON MY POLYGONS/AREA GEOMETRY TEST!!!!!!!!!!  what now geometry what now?  i seriously had no idea what i was doing on that test and then all of the sudden i make a 93 and then i get the bonus right, which i totally made up that answer, and get 10 more points!!!!  it was so awesome!!!!  Ugh i am so MAD at my freshman buddy, Adam Hartwick, though because he showed absolutely NO WORK and he copied off of one of his friends and got a 107.  I worked on that test and he didn't and then he gets the better grade.  oh well, it'll bite him in the ass in the end.    My plans for tomorrow.  Hockey game against Flower Mound 6:30 to around 7:15/20 and then to the Lariette show thing (that actually starts at 7 but i'm going to be late) to support my friend Brittnee and watch her solo dance thing for her competition.  Probably not going to do any hw i have that night and i'll probably do it all in french.  yay for blow off classes.    Now its time for the friend story of the week:  Nadia Kudsi  hmmm i don't remember the exact day we met, but it was through Sarah.  I think the first time we ever hung out was at this party Sarah had and we played this game called Encore.  Encore is this extremely torturous game where this card gives you a topic and you have to think of a song with that topic in it and then sing at least 8 words of that song to prove it.  Well me and Nadia were going at it because the topic was....trees or something and we were throwing songs back and forth....until i finally threw "Ontario Sucks" by the Arrogant Worms back at her and she was beat.  We became friends after that.  She was there when i used my "vast" knowledge of Five Iron Frenzy's "Oh Canada" against Sarah when the topic was "guys with a name starting with a consonant".  lol remember "did we say that william shatner is a native citizen...."  good times!  I always thought Nadia was this really REALLY funny person! Everything that comes out of her mouth is hilarious!  She always thought that it was really funny that i have a liking for international men, especially one's from Finland like Niko etc., and that i loved hockey.  We also watched "On the Line" aka that terrible movie that Lance Bass of N'Sync was in together.  It was the greatest movie ever.  She also got to see my famous John Travolta dance at that party.  Since we had some of the same friends (ie Sarah, Kendra, Kristen etc) we went to alot of the same parties.  She invited me to her 16th costume party-birthday-extravaganza and thats where the friendship became super solid.  Lots of pictures were taken, i found out that i'm in Nadia's scrapbook (which is quite an honor since she is the world champion scrapbooker!) and i ended up spending the night, all and all a great party.  And that night, the BopIt obsession began for me and Nadia.  Nadia got this BopIt pen for her bday from somebody and i asked her if i could play with it.  We should've never opened it.  I started the game and i twisted it but that stupid pen said i lost.  You know what i mean, it says "Twist it!" and you twist it but then it says "Oh you lost!".  Taylor Stewart was also there and her and Nadia laughed at me as i said "Damn you BopIt Damn youuuuuuuu!".  We just thought that was the funniest thing ever.  Then finally, i won that stupid game!!!  And then the famous phrase that everyone uses now, "What now ______ what now!?!?!' was coined.  All from me saying "What now Bop It what now!?!?!  what now bitch!!!" while doing a victory dance.  lalala on went on that night, while me and Nadia "bonded" by staying up until 2am playing that stupid BopIt pen and messing each other up while we were trying to win.  So we became really good friends and i started going to VRBC, so we got to see each other alot.  We went on Fall Retreat this year together (along with sarah, kendra etc) and we played BopIt for the entire 3 days as well eating gummie bears.  She witnessed me eating a pound and a half of gummie bears by myself!  She's always been there for me when i have to rant about my guy problems and she's always the one making me smile and be positive when things seem to go horribly wrong.  She always listens to my crazy hockey rants and my analyzations of every game.  She also was up with me at the crack of dawn to listen to me give her the play by play of the USA vs. Finland and the USA vs. Canada games in the World Jr. Hockey cup!!  Did i mention that she thought it was funny when i told her that i cried at a Coppell game when we lost???  lol, i love you Nadia!!!!  Peace out homeslice lol!!!!  World Jr. Hockey cup at 10am, lol, go finland and canada!!!!  "I'm not a girl, i'm a pretty man!", Cheerleader Demon = Mercer  The end.  Cheers, ~~~Taylor~~~

      Hmmmm.....school.......boring.......not worth my time...... So i'm all emotionally and physically preparing myself for 4th period where i was under the impression that we were supposed to run a mile.  So i'm getting all ready to run a straight mile and not stop and then Mrs. Brinkman is all like "oh we're not running today, its too cold".  what!?!??!!?!  Its not cold!  Its only 40 degrees! Its colder at the Valley Ranch ice rink when you're sitting in the stands at a game!  (lol Britt! we're hard core! "after spending as much time at that rink as we do, we feel no cold, we feel no pain, we just see hockey and rejoice")  lol we got our height and weight taken today!!!  I'm 5'5 and 108lbs!!!!  I GAINED 8 LBS!!!!!  WOOHOO!!!!  Maybe thats the muscle i've been building......i can only hope.  Because i used to be 100....hmm interesting.    Yeah i kinda had problems with Brittnee today, she wants me to go to her lariette thing but i'm kinda iffy on that.  I really don't want to sit by myself for 2 hrs.  And i kinda already had plans before that to go to the hockey game.  But i feel bad because i want to support Brittnee.  I mean her thing starts at 7 and she only wants me to come for the last 30 mins......but i dunno if the game is going to get out before her thing starts.  I know the game will end between 7:15 and 7:30 and her act is the second to last or something.....but i dunno, i'm sure i'll work it out.  Brittnee said whether i go or not she's not going to do something stupid like end our friendship or something.  I dunno.....my mom said she's help me work it out where i could go to both so it'll be ok.    Blonde Kid with no fashion sense update: ok i hope i don't have lunch with this kid next tri because if i see that jacket one more time.........aaaah!!!!!  I didn't get to see what shirt he was wearing today, but $10 its one that doesn't match his skin color.  Kendra and Nadia wanted to see what this kid looked like so i told them that they could see him after 4th period because he usually passes us when we're walkng up the stairs.  But then he didn't come today!!!  Kendra was pointing at every short guy that walked past us saying "is that him?" and i was like no its not, you'll know when its him trust me.  Oh well, we'll try again tomorrow guys lol.    hmmmm ok i guess i'll go work on hw now (aka i'll go call and talk to people about their day)  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~  P.S- Coppell actually plays Flower Mound this week at 6:30 and the keller game is the week after this week.  *crosses fingers* i hope we win because FM just recently beat Jesuit!!!!!

      Today was funny.  All of my classes were boring until we got to 4th and 5th period.  4th period Aerobics, we had fitness testing which was extremely amusing.  5th period BCIS, i finished my project a day early and then sat there and listened to music the entire time.  It was cool.  Mr. Phillips was really funny because he couldn't figure out how to put on my headphones to listen to my recording.  It was great.  And me and Kate made jokes about orgies in the back of the computer room.  Thats what happens when you're really super bored in BCIS.    Blonde Kid with no fashion sense update: four words - die ugly jacket die.  I've decided that i'm going to go see Miracle for my third time, sometime this week.  Lauren said if me and Brittany go on Valentine's day, people will think we're lesbians.  I thought that was really funny.  Maybe we could attract guys that way......lol britt are you up for it? it'll be one of the best performances of our careers.  oh yeah, i decided that the whole incident with those Flower Mound wrestler guys was the ABSOLUTE WORST performance of my career....EVER.  Jess and Britt won't let me live it down....and jess wasn't even frickin there! lol, oh well.    Me, Jess and Britt went to Quizno's today and i told Tom (Jess' bf) that he flat out couldn't come.  i knew he was thinking about asking and i cut him off.  There were so many hot guys that came into Quizno's today!!!  And we're sitting there trying to talk about girl stuff and all these guys keep walking in!  We said alot of stupid things and made alot of funny jokes.  My personal fave was the one about the popup spam in our brains when Britt said the word "penetrate".  "i need spybot for my brain!!!!", lol britt!  good times you guys.  oh yeah and we discovered how much Jess owns Tom.  Its great!  gotta go study for geometry now.....yeah, like thats actually going to happen.....  Love,  ~~~Taylor~~~

      Types of Fighting  by me and Jess * If you fight like Niko Kapanen, you throw a punch, don't get caught and act like nothing happened * If you fight like Mike Modano, you get 2mins in the box and the other guy gets 5 * If you fight like Aaron Downey, its 5 mins for everyone, including the unconscious guy ^ this is what happens when you watch the super bowl and hate football, LOL Jess ~~~ just archiving that old joke from the super bowl ~~~  Oh yes and Brittany would like me to tell everyone that i will share Mac and Johnson with Jess since she didn't go with us on Miracle's opening day to lay claim on her own boys.  But Rizzo is mine and OC is Brittany's.  Thank you that will be all.  haha oh yeah i forgot to include this one part of the story where me and Brittany exaggerated our one hockey game that we played at her house.  So i'm all like "i'm going to kick your ass next time we play" because Britty's all saying "mean" stuff about me and she started all saying "Bring it!!!! I'm not afraid of pain!!!!".  That was really funny and i forgot to write it.  Sorry, lol.  That was one of the really funny parts to the night.  ok i'm really done now, ~~~Taylor~~~

      I think today has been the best day all week.  I saw "Miracle" for the second time today.  I almost wanted to cry it was so awesome.  When i see that movie, it reminds me of when Coppell won state.  And the end of the movie where they're all on the pedestal and putting their hands in the air saying that they're number one.  it was so awesome.  Jess went with me and Britt today and she really liked it also.  Sarah was supposed to go with us, but since we went to the early showing (which i didn't know that we were going to do until Britty called me at the crack of dawn aka 10:30am), she couldn't go because she was still at church.  No big deal, i'll go to that movie again.  Alright to all the other girls out there, me and brittany saw the movie opening day, so we've already got claims on the players.  And they go as this:  Me: Rizzo (aka Mike Eruzione), Mac (aka Robbie McClanahan)and Johnson (aka Mark Johnson) Brittany: OC (aka Jack O'Clanahan) Jessica: i think she said she liked Jimmy (Jim Craig) the goalie....  so just take note and all lol.  yeah so today was a great day.  And then after the movie, i went and watched the last part of the all-star game.  it was alright, kinda boring though.  West lost to East 6-4.  Stars play NY Islanders on Wednesday and i think we have tickets to that game and Coppell plays Keller in Euless at 9 frickin 30 pm.  I don't think i'll be able to go to that game because a) its in Euless at 9:30 and b) i've got Brittnee's competition thing to go to because i'm her moral support and she's one of my best friends.    Yeah so, best of luck to all of you for a good week.  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      OMG. "Miracle" IS THE BEST FRICKIN MOVIE.....EVER.  Me and Brittany think it tops Pirates of the Carribbean and thats saying alot considering that we saw that movie like 4 times each in theatres.  It was soooo awesome.  you felt like you were really in the game.  There was this one part where the Commie Russia dude knocked over the USA goalie and scored a goal and then Me and Britt started yelling goalie interference at the screen.  Then we remembered that we're not really at a game and they didn't have that penalty back in the 80's.  oops.  it was sooooo awesome.  And that movie is full of hot guys!!!  Every hockey player in that movie was incredibly hot and they all had really nice bodies.  Me and Britt were crying/sniffling at every emotional part of the movie.  I mean seriously, the guys behind us must've thought we were chronic depressive because we were all like "that was so beautiful" *sniffle*.  lol, we had to do an eye liner check after the movie.  Oh yes and here comes the part of the evening that i'm sure Brittany will rub into my face for the rest of the year or everytime Coppell plays Flower Mound.  Let me just set the scene for you.  There were these mediocre-looking guys right behind us and i was like "hey for the hell of it, lets chat them up".  So, me being the stupid person i am, said "hey do you play for Flower Mound?" (they had FM letter jackets on, class of '05 if anyone wanted to know) and i'm thinking that they would assume i'm talking about hockey.  And here goes the rest of the convo: them: yeah we play for FM me: you play on the varsity hockey team?  (i told you i was dumb) them: no we wrestle me: (i didn't hear them ok!) what? you play basketball? them: no we're in wrestling me: ooh you play wrestling! great.... and then me and Britt practically ran out of there!  oh man but here comes the best part of the evening besides the movie.  There was this hot guy standing next to us while we were waiting to be picked up (month and 1/2 until i can drive! thank god!) who we KNEW this time was a hockey player because his sweatshirt had "Jaguar Hockey" on it and his number was on the sleeve (#96 if anyone knows him).  So i really wanted to chat him up also, but i was too scared.  Finally i caught his eye and he smiled at me, but i was still too scared to talk to him.  Britt took my cell phone because i was about to chew the antenna off, a habit i developed last Coppell Hockey season during playoffs and state.   I grabbed her hand that had my phone it it and i was like "you don't give me my phone back i swear, i'll give you stitches like last time".  Now this got that boy's attention.  Now some back history on the reason i said that.  Last time me and Britt actually weren't very busy, we decided to play hockey.  So we got our skates on and started to play.  She was beating me by like 3 points (i think the score at the time was 6-3)  and then she said something that pissed me off and i don't even remember what it was.  So i hit her with my hockey stick and she had to get stitches on her back.  She hit me back with her hockey stick and i got a cut across my face.  Her cut was slightly worse though, lol.  (haha Nadia, we talked about this in aerobics, i can't play hockey because id get so pissed off so much that i'd rack up more penalty minutes than the entire team combined) Anyways back to the story.  So we revisited that entire experience and even improved/elaborated/exaggerated just a tad.  That guy was watching us and smiling right up until he had to leave.  I think he thought it was funny that people such as us, who don't look the type to play hockey much less get into a scrap, were threatening to beat each other up.  I especially loved the part of the whole thing where Brittany's like "You can't stand to lose!!  You love to win and you're a sore loser! i had to go easy on you because you were losing so bad!" and then i said "you did not! i played just as hard as you did.....bitch!" and then she's like "i'm going to get beat up real bad next time we play aren't i?", i said hell yeah you are.  Man, i think our little "show" was not so abnoxious to get everyone's attention which is not what we wanted but not too little exaggerated to get the guy's attention.  lol, good times Britt that was fun!  Britt also spent the night last night which was fun.  We had Jack in the Box for dinner and contemplated all of the reasons why my Niko hasn't tied the knot yet with his fiance, Liisa.  Ok lemme just give you the back history here.  Niko has known this girl since early childhood and officially has been dating her for 7 years, living together for 4 of those years.  They have been engaged for exactly one year as of today.  Ok and here's something else, most couples have started planning their wedding by now and at least have a date for when its going to happen.  No, not Niko, he hasn't got a date or anything.  How do i know this?  I have connections.  So me and Britt think maybe he's having second thoughts.  yaaaaay! He doesn't need a fiance!  I don't know about you guys but if i had been dating the SAME GUY for more than 4 years, i'd be like "ok so are you going to marry me or what?".  I dunno, maybe Liisa doesn't have anyone to go back to.  Maybe she's clingy?  lol, who knows?  Yeah so then we were online and we saw Tom's (Jess' boyfriend) profile that said "I love ya Jessica".  THEY'VE ONLY BEEN DATING FOR A WEEK AND A HALF!!!!! And thats really weird because most of the time guys are the last people to ever say "i love you".  And the fact that he spelled it L-O-V-E rather than L-U-V.   Scary stuff.  Whats really bad is that Tom is driving Jess crazy and there's an 85% chance that she's going to break up with him on Monday.  Reasons why: too clingy, too touchy feely, ALWAYS FRICKIN THERE, never really gives he space, never really gives her friend/leave me alone i'm talking to my girls time, knows where all her classes are, she has to hide from him to get time to herself and he has 7 tardies in the last 2 weeks because he waits until jess goes to class before he goes to his class.  Jess is starting to hope that he gets 3 more tardies so he'll get an ISS and she won't have to see him for awhile.  Yeah, so that didn't last very long.  Oh well.  Me and Britt also watched Zoolander, brilliant movie.  gotta go, everyone see "Miracle" this weekend, i promise you'll love it!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      YAAAAAAAAAAAY!!!!!!!  "MIRACLE" COMES OUT TODAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Me and Brittany are going to see it!!!!  aw, man just think of the plethora of hot guys and hockey teams that are going to be there!!!!  eeeeee i'm so excited!!!!  I hope we're the only girls in the theatre, that way there's no competition lol.  not that i'd really hook up with any of them or anything......but if there was any boring parts in the movie (which i'm sure there wouldn't be), there would be eye candy to pay attention to.  aaaaaaaahhhhh t-minus 1hr and 20 mins until me and britt go!!!!    Blonde kid with no fashion sense update (i swear this should be a column in a magazine): aaaaaahhhh the stupid jacket!!!!!  maybe i should set fire to it while he's looking the other way.  today was embarassing when i was inspecting him by myself (because Lauren was at Gold Renaissance) and he looked at me and gave me this look like "aha i know you're checking me out!" when i WASN'T!  i'm inspecting his clothing so i can tell Lauren and then we can write a report about it.  great.  now he's going to be "thinking i'm checking him out" everytime we're in the same lunch line together.  stupid blonde kid! i am not checking you out! i am telling other people about your poor color coordination so in effect they can fix their clothing problems!!!    Sports update: NHL All star break this weekend.  Watch the YoungStars game on Saturday to check out all the under 25 players and then watch the All Star game to....well....watch the all stars.  Coppell tied with Marcus 3-3.  Michael Ozowski sucks and i want T.J back.  We would've won, had TJ been in goal.  I don't like Ozowski, i don't like the way he plays and i certainly don't want him in my frickin' team's goal.  aaaaagh.  But you know what, its ok.  Because i found out that Jesuit LOST to Flower Mound 3-2!!!  What losers!!! haha.  anyways.....yeah.......only 2 more games until we get TJ back and we can have better wins.  thank god.  lalalalala anyways, i really have nothing to write because all i can think about is hockey because of the NHL All star break AND i'm going to see Miracle tonight!!!!!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      hey everyone, i was completely off today again.  today has just been a freaking off week.  and i'm depressed.  again.  i don't know why but i'm sure i can guess.    anyways, Coppell Hockey plays Marcus tonight at 8pm in the Valley Ranch rink.  Come and represent.  oh god of high school hockey please let us win.  maybe if we get more fans, then they'll win.  *crosses fingers*  Blonde Kid with no fashion sense update: he wore yellow and it was a nice color for him. Made his hair look slightly less terrible, but not by alot.  i didn't get a chance to see his shoes but i can bet $10 that they were the socks with sandals thing again.  and he wore the......you guessed it.....the ugly tan jacket.    Today in aerobics we had to do this "Sweating to the Oldies with Richard Simmons" movie thing.  IT WAS SO FLIPPIN FUNNY.  it was brilliant.  SIZZLE!!  lol nadia and kendra.  it was like spirit fingers extreme.  i swear Richard Simmons is SO FREAKING GAY.  I mean the boy is infiltrated with estrogen.  lol, yeah that was the amusing part of my day.  hmmmmm....i would write more about the gayness of the movie but i'm kinda tired right now and i have to do homework.  lemme just say one last thing: that movie was the most LSD-induced workout video i've ever seen.  thank you for your time.  Go Coppell! *prays* ~~~Taylor~~~

      omg i had chronic ADD extreme today i swear.  i could not concentrate on ANYTHING.  my mind was messed up and i felt like i couldn't remember anything i had done over the past few days when i knew that i could remember somehow when i thought about it.  it seemed like the more i thought about things, the more i couldn't remember them.  scary stuff.    i finished my paper on how society and civilization can be destroyed by fear....it probably sucks and is completely disorganized, but whatever.  somehow i concentrated on that and finished it.  weird.  i got an 81 on a french test which wouldn't bother me so much usually but since we have only 2 grades in french right now, so i have an 89.  i haven't had an average lower than 96 in french since i frickin started learning it.  i guess i can raise it with this vocab test thats coming up, but i can't NOT make lower than a 96, i gotta keep my high A streak going.    really bored tonight, nothing to do except watch hockey and talk online.  if New Jersey is playing tonight, i think i'll watch my Patrik Elias play.  Maybe he'll score a few goals, lol.  Coppell vs. Marcus this week at 8pm, god save us i hope we win.  I'm really worried because 4 of our top players are suspended.  Hopefully some of our top scorers like Josh or Adam will pull us through by just scoring a hell of alot of goals.  come represent, maybe it'll help them win if you come.    11 days until valentines day and for the 5th year in a row, it will suck.  terribly.  i mean, i know i shouldn't care about boyfriends and i don't particularly need one according to a variety of people and i know none of the relationships that get the valentines' day cheer won't last very long.......but i still really wish that i could have a guy and get a little v-day present from him.  meh, better throw those hopes into the closet because its not going to happen.  i'm sure me and britt will hang out, watch hockey and throw candy at the valentines' day commercials on v-day lol.  lalalallalala.....Sarah pointed out to me that its ok because she doesn't have a date either....and then we talked about how this friend of ours kinda rubs it into our faces that "blah blah relationship blah i have one".  oh well, its all good.  Gotta go!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      Hey i actually did my homework at home today!  I am soooo proud of myself!  except i have to do my grammar homework during french because i accidently brought my vocab book home instead.  No big deal, its just subordinate and independent clauses.  Hmmm, i have just discovered that i have absolutely no motivation for school anymore, unless its writing papers for English but other than that, i have no desire to do homework.  Right now, i have to write a paper on how fear destroys civilization and society.....its bound to be fun because i've read books on that.  The only thing i hate about writing papers for english is because they're all like "use/quote textual evidence" and i would much rather just give my opinion and examples.  Oh well.  lalalala....i am soooo bored right now you have no idea.  Super Bowl Sunday.  Oh man, if i could've taped Brittany when New England and Carolina tied......jeez it was funny yet scary at the same time.  Lol, love ya Britt you know i do!  I mean, i've seen her get mad at hockey games but never this pissed off.....especially at stupid football.  Me and Jessica were all freaking out when they tied too....not because we actually cared but because we knew that if they didn't win a) Britt would go into mental breakdown extreme, b) we would all die, c) we would have to hear about it for the next 3 weeks......oh god, there'd be hell to pay.  Thank god for that Patriots kicker dude, he is now officially the saviour of the Super Bowl for the Patriots and Brittany alike.  I mean if they lost or had to go into overtime.....i don't know how much longer we could've made it.  I ate so much food though, i felt sick.  oh yeah! also after the Patriots won the game, we went all around Britt's neighborhood screaming about how New England had won.  It was fun.  Then we went to Tom's house (Jessica's boyfriend) and talked to him for awhile.  I swear that kid.....if Jess won't tell him, i will.....he needs to learn that you (the guy) put your arm around the waist and NOT the shoulder unless you're giving a hug.  And he walked around like that with Jess.  it would've bothered me but maybe it didn't bother her.  I hope he's not reading this....that would really suck.  Sorry Tom! You know i love you and you and Jess are perfect for each other!  Yeah and then when we went back to Tom's house to drop Tom off, we were all kinda standing there in this awkward moment.....and then finally me and Britt got the hint, and left Jess and Tom to each other.  LOL, while me and Britt were walking away, i was like "should we turn around?" and she was like "No!' but then we turned around anyways and we saw them kiss! it was so cute yet so funny!  Jess figured out that we saw them and we had to run for our lives down the street because she didn't want us to turn around lol.  Finally she got over it and we just sang that song that goes like "Jessica and Tom sitting in a tree....K-I-S-S-I-N-G, first comes the dating, then comes the marriage then comes the baby in the baby carriage!.....".  lol, i haven't sung (verb conjugation?)that song in sooo long!  Blonde kid with no fashion sense update: oh man its been so long since me and Lauren have seen him!  ok despite the fact that he wore the ugly jacket and a white shirt etc......he lopped off all his hair!!!  one day he has longish wavy hair and the next day he just cuts it all off and short!  He looks terrible.  I mean, seriously, i weep for him.  Lauren says it looks terrible also.  I hope his hair gets a speedy recovery, lol.  I think he dyes his hair also.  Because he top is really light blonde and towards the bottom, its sorta dirty blonde.  And it doesn't look natural either.    Now its time for the friend story of the week!  Brittany Pleau  Lets see, the first time i ever met her was that one time when i stopped in the hall to talk to Jessica before Masengill's class that tri.  She seemed nice, just like Jessica.  And i wouldn't really talk to her until 3rd tri though.  We ended up having PreAP English 1 and Algebra together.  We would talk alot because we both thought Sam Parnell (the guy on KCBY) was the hottest thing since jelly sandals of the 90's.  And she gave me the website for the brilliant movie making group called the Broken Crayons, in which Sam was their leader.  THEN we discovered that we both like hockey.  and that my friends is what started it all.  We talked so much that we had to be separated.  Even then, we talked about hockey from across the room.  We talked all through English as well as Algebra.  We became pretty good friends.  We went ice skating together this one time, which was pretty awesome except i fell 3 times (once in front of this hockey player! eek! who was really nice about it and said he fell all the time, but it was still embarassing).  Then i spent the night at her house and met her parents, who are super awesome.  Her mom is canadian and her dad is bostonian, which made them really funny.  We spent more and more time together, watching hockey games, talking about hockey, planning weddings to hockey players (lol the just married zamboni!), talking about guys, giving each other advice......generally everything that best friends do!  We have really REALLY funny jokes, but if we told you, we'd probably have to kill you.  Soon i found out that her and Jessica were best friends and in turn Jess became one of my best friends.  We attempted to make a Jackass movie which we never got around to.....but now we've got bigger things to worry about.  She always is there to give me advice on generally everything and sits there and listens to my crazy theories and rants about annoying people.  We sit around and plan who we should sick the Canadian Mafia on (lol!!!) and make every dirty joke possible about hockey.  Brittany's an awesome person and she's hilarious and i love her to death! i know she'll always be one of my really good friends and best hockey buddy ever!!!  rock on Brittany, part of the coppell hockey second season 75!  oh yeah, also when she comes over she always has to leave early to tend to her horse.....but thats cool we love her anyways!  did i mention what she does when Mike Modano gets so much as touched by another player?  she goes into cardiac arrest!! lol, i still love you britt!!!  rick on Canada rick on!!!, tie theory (just made today!), finnish people theory, european theory, hockey player theory, "lets drop the gloves and go barehanded!", "you don't wear clothes to play tennis!", "just do it, Instant message!".....lol and all the great times we've had!  ^^ yay for friend stories  Alright my mom is yelling at me to go clean my room or something along those lines or just get off the comp so i will talk to you all later!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      Yay its the SuperBowl day, the day where all the great commercials come on!  This is where the famous Coors Light "Here's to Love Songs" commercial came out, one of my fave commercials besides the Wingman commercial.  Oh yeah, and 2 really good football teams play to figure out who's champion.  Since i don't know all that much about football, i'm just going to cheer for the Patriots because a) they're Britt's fave team and b) if i don't Britt will kill me.  So yeah, go Patriots!  After i eat some of my parents' party food, i'm going to Brittany's house to "watch" the game.  Its bound to be one hell of a party.   OMG STARS WIN LAST NIGHT OVER PHEONIX!!!!!  5-4 BABY!!!  And my Niko got an assist AND he hit someone really hard!!!!  And Brendan Morrow (he's sooo adorable!) got a hat trick!!!!!  It was sooo awesome!!!!  Oh yeah and my fave (and the hottest) player on Pheonix, Shane Doan, scored a goal also.  It was great.  We didn't have to go into overtime or anything.  But it always seemed like everytime Dallas got an insurance goal on Pheonix, Pheonix scored and put it back to a one goal lead.  Crazy!  My Niko looked sooooo adorable when after he helped Brendan get a goal and they were all hitting each other's heads/male bonding.  He looked so happy!  and you know whats even better? San Jose lost in overtime, which makes us only 3 pts away from taking them over!!!  But LA beat Edmonton in overtime, which sucks but thats ok!  hmmmm....i went to church today, it was cool.  I had to apologize to my friend Jake Ross because on Tuesday or something i accidently called him Kyle....randomly! he said it was no big deal or anything, but i felt really bad.  But its ok, he forgave me, lol!  lalalalala i think i'm going to enjoy my NEW NHL CENTER ICE PACKAGE!!!!   The package that allows me to watch EVERY FREAKING GAME IN THE NHL.  Its awesome.  gotta go!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      today was alright, really slow.  I hated the fact that my face felt all nasty all day even though people told me that it looked normal.....i dunno, i think its the climate change.    I found Mr. Masengill's room today! Now i can skip class and visit him!  Did i mention that yesterday me and my mom were rebels and we went out for brunch after my dentist appointment?  I got cheese fries, it rocked.  I missed first and second period!!  Oh man, have you ever had that feeling that you miss someone alot but they're like, right there in front of you.  All of the sudden its like you weren't as close as you used to be and you missed that?  Maybe this is a repercussion of school and tiredness and thats why everyone's acting so different.    PLAYOFFS START TODAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GO COWBOYS, SECOND TITLE LETS DO THIS!!!!!!  19 days until my birthday!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      today sucked. alot. the end.  Sports Update: Coppell takes on Flower Mound (psh like they have a chance when they've only won like...2 games and we just beat them 8-0 a few days ago) for the beginning of the section playoffs en route to state.  Come, represent and watch hockey.  It'll be fun.  Dallas plays Edmonton on Wednesday at 8pm (i think) without Marty Turco for the 3rd time, one more game and then he's back.  $5 we lose in overtime 3-2.  Britt says because we're at home, things might change....i dunno, but i'm a pretty faithless person when it comes to sports by nature not to mention pessimistic but whatever.  Go Stars and Go Cowboys.  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      hmmmm....today is boring.  I had to work on my stupid message board project for Dixon, i only need one more post and then i'm done!  Now i have to work on World History hw....oh joy.  in case some of you lovely people don't know, i'm taking the AP World History exam on May 5th.  Why? Because i signed up for it and my mom and mr. Dixon were like "Take it or die".  Oh but here's the fun part.  I haven't actually taken the AP World History class so i honestly have no idea what i'm doing.  Sarah said she'll help me and my mom is going to buy me this CD rom so i know what i'm doing.  Will i pass? i doubt it, but i might as well try.    This Friday, the movie that i've been waiting 3 weeks to see, "The Prince and Me" with Julia Stiles and this other guy comes out!!!!  I can't wait to see it! Because a) the Prince guy is hot, b) the Prince guy looks like Prince William, c) the Prince guy is hot.  Oh yeah, and its a chick flick where the girl becomes a princess (or has the option to become a princess) with the Prince of Denmark!  Which we all know could never reeeeally happen, but thats cool whatever.  What i find amusing about this movie though is that the Prince guy is the Prince of Denmark, but has a British accent when he is in fact.....danish.  Interesting.  Sarah says maybe he learned how to speak English in England.  I think there was a secret war where England took over Denmark kinda like the Secret War in Canada and i call this war....the Anglo-Danish War (lol Sarah).  Or maybe mr. dixon's "Britain rules the world by proxy" speech is true.  I dunno, the Prince guy is still hot and i'm still going to see it despite its....ahem...lingual/nationalistic/socio-geographic flaws.    alright i need to do hw now.  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      so yesterday me, Jess and Britty went to Quizno's and hung out for about 2 hrs.  Then Carol Lacey showed up and we hung out with her before we had to leave.  At quizno's, we debated if "farm" could be a verb or a noun.  We also said lots of really funny stuff, all of which were so funny that i can't remember about half of it.  Then they came over to my house and we watched Blind Date shows, Degrassi and Radio Free Roscoe.  Then we sat up in my room until 2 am, acting really drunk though we had had no alcohol and we ate a few hangover drops, mint balls, muffins with drinking coke at the same time.  Jess fell off the bed randomly which was really really funny.  Tons of fun, all around.  Today i haven't really done much of anything, i'll probably just watch hockey like i always do.  Dallas plays Vancouver tonight at 8pm.....i'll probably be at someone elses house for the game like britts or jess' but i dunno for sure yet.  Marty Turco is suspended so i hope we'll make it through.    Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      damn straight, my favorite pansies in the entire freaking world....the dallas stars....came back from a 2-0 deficit to tie it up at 3-3 and then win it all 4-3 in overtime!  Bill Guerin scored the overtime AGAIN for the millionth time in a row.  It was tight! My Niko played a good game and so did Mike Modano.  Then me and Brittany started talking about groins and calling the teams other flower names besides pansies....because we wanted to, thats why.    Coppell kicked Flower Mound's butt 8-0 because we rock like that.  FM was playing alright at the start, but then they gave up and let us score 8 goals.  Way to suck FM!!!!  And you know what the best part about this whole thing is that we play them in the first game of the playoffs!?!?!  Like they have a chance!!!   Haha, this'll be great.  And we'll either play Jesuit or Marcus in the next game.  Then we'll go on to be state champions.....i hope we don't win metroplex though, because then thats a bad omen as to how we'll win state.  EX: Southlake Carroll.    School was boring, AGAIN.  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      so detroit didn't beat freaking San Jose......shame on you red wings!  This means that Dallas has to work twice as hard tonight, not that i would expect any less :)  We play Edmonton tonight at 9 freaking o clock....but i have no hw tonight so it doesn't matter how late i stay up.  Lindsay Kazi tried to convince me today that i really am pretty and all that.....meh, if i was that pretty, i would have a boyfriend.  The end.    gooooooo dallas!

      crap we have a freaking research paper in PreAp english 2.......argh, its not like its hard, its just time consuming.  school was cool today.....i finished an IPC project in an hour, i finished a lab......yeah and french went by really fast.    Sports Update: Coppell beats Marcus 5-2!!!!!  rock on, but for awhile there it was a close game.  Marcus was doing well, they were really playing hard and utilizing good defense.....it was tied for about a period....then we scored 3 goals and it was over.  It was fun!  My feet turned purple from the cold...i wore sandals, but i honestly don't feel the cold anymore.  Deines (from Marcus) didn't do anything funny tonight such as banging on the glass of the penalty box.  Dallas plays Edmonton tomorrow night at freaking 9pm!!  Watch that game, its bound to be full of awesome stuff.  We're one point from overtaking San Jose, pray that Detroit beats them tonight!   Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      school was boring......but i got a 98 (I think, dixon couldn't remember) on my first PreAp History test which means that i (and haniya) destroyed the curve for the class!!!  Go us, we rock niya!!!  lol, i'm really proud of myself, i don't think i really studied for that test very well.  Maybe i don't need to study just like i didn't study in masengill's class!!  Take that Charlie Mitchell! I don't have to work in this class!!!  lol, ok we're good there...  Blonde Kid with no fashion sense update: Alright i think he's doing good now, he's started hanging out with that broad again.  At least he's stopped with the socks and sandals bit.  I've decided that broad he hangs out with....looks like a horse.  I'm sorry!  But she does!!  She wears far too much eye liner and powder and her face is shaped weird.  Anyways, the blonde kid's jeans were cute today and his shirt looked nice.  His arms looked skinny today.....or have his arms always been skinny?  I dunno, that one white shirt he wore made him look like he had tons of muscle.  Or maybe that was a figment of my imagination and i was wishing that he had tons of muscle.  I dunno.  Sports Update: REMEMBER Coppell vs. Marcus tomorrow at 7:30pm!  Double hockey week don't forget!! Then on Thursday we meet up with Flower Mound at 8!!  Stars play Calgary tonight and i know we'll take them down!  Your team is sooooo going down Steven Danby!    Gotta go!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      so Britty, Jess and I went out to the movies when i had been 2 hrs fresh off the plane.....we saw Starsky and Hutch and returned Jess' pants to American Eagle.  Owen Wilson is sooooooooooo adorable!!!!  I love him and his beautiful hair!!!  He was sooo sweet in that movie and generally every movie he's in!  Then they came over to spend the night and we had tons of fun while they got addicted to the Hangover Drops i got them while in Virginia.  Then today we walked to Quizno's for lunch and then went to the grocery store to read bridal/gossip magazines and look at the makeup aisle.  We soon discovered that the Tom Thumb was having some sort of cakewalk and if your number was picked then you got a free cake!  We decided to win this contest because we really wanted a cake.  So we had to wait 30 mins to play again and we passed this hot guy (that i didn't see right then! even though jess and britt knew he was there) and he was sticking toothpicks in these tomato slices......and i look over him and say "mmmmm tomatoes"....i honestly did not even see the guy!  Then it turns out that he's really cute and he looks over at us when i say that.  He probably thought i was checking him out when i honestly just wanted to eat a freaking yummy tomato!!  So yeah when we came back around after getting our makeup/magazines, he was all grinning at us and he told us numbers to stand on so we could win.  Then we missed the second round because Jess wouldn't listen to me.....so we ran all the way down the aisles to get there and we missed it.  Of course Kenneth, the tomato boy, was laughing at us.  So we asked him if we could eat the tomatoes and he let us have a bunch!  Then we walked back and decided we should probably buy our stuff before people start asking us to leave.  So we got all this gum because school starts tomorrow...about 12 packs.  Yes, there was a freaking hot guy as the cashier, just our luck! So he rings it all up and the three of us are trying to figure out how we're going to divide it up and pay for it.....and then all of the sudden the cashier, Kayden (what an adorable name!), starts pressing all these buttons and taking off all this money!  We're like what the heck are you doing!?!?!  We hand him our money ($24.01) and he says "No actually its $20.01" and we're like how did that happen?  He says "oh you know...*shrugs and grins*" He used his discount to take off money for us!!!  And its not like we didn't have enough money to pay!!  It was soooo sweet of him.  So we decided to give our numbers to these 2 guys because they completely earned it.  So we write a note to Kenneth with our numbers on it and leave it on his table with his tomatoes.  And we started to not give our numbers to Kayden.  So we "left" and i thought what if Kenneth doesn't see our note and some other creepy guy takes it!  So i went in there and asked him if he has seen our "eyeliner that we dropped".  He went around and looked for it with me even though it didn't exist!!!  Well i tried to lead him to the table, but i couldn't so i just picked up the note and handed it to him and said "this is for you, we weren't sure if you would find it there on the table....seeya".  He grinned and said "thanks!".  Then Brittany and Jess took FOREVER to get the number sheet to Kayden!  But eventually Jess walked up to him when he was leaving his NICE CAR and said "here!" and he was like "*grin* thanks!".  so that was a fun day!  Oh yeah and we didn't want Kayden to know that we walked to Tom Thumb, so we walked up to this random car and started acting like we were going to get in until he went in to the store before we started the walk back to my house to eat our german chocolate cake that we finally won in the cakewalk!  so awesome!!  We also came up with "Taking one for the team" points in which you must do something that benefits everyone like giving the phone numbers of everyone to a hot guy or carrying stuff a cake or giving a dollar to someone/being a good citizen.  Currently me and Jess are tied for the lead with 2 pts and Britty has 1.5 pts.    Sports Update: Stars have been kickin ass winning both their games against Vancouver (3-0) and St. Louis (3-1).  Who knows if my Niko played because i wasn't here to see those games, but if he was playing i'm sure he did well.  Stars play Calgary tomorrow at 8pm, we better win that game!  Here's the big story of the night!!!  My Coppell Hockey boys totally kicked ass in their Colorado Tourney...5-0-0 with spectacular wins over every team....so this must mean that every team sucks and we're the best in the region!!!  I think this says alot about our chances of winning state.  Do we go to nationals now?  Alright now its time for the wins:   First game: Coppell vs. Skyview Falcons (Montana)  Final score: 9-0 W First period score: 4-0 (4pts: Trey Snow - 1; Jimmy Hunter- 1; Ashcon Habibi - 2) Second period: 5-0 (1pt: Josh Heimbach -1) Third period: 9-0 (4pts: Josh Heimbach - 1, Trey Snow - 3) Notes: wow Montana hockey must suck.....and we only had 2 penalties the entire game and Montana had zero!  We outshot them 44 to 16 and this means that T.J. was brilliant between those pipes.  Trey Snow got a hat trick plus one goal.     Second game: Coppell vs. Taos Ice Tigers (New Mexico)  Final Score: 4-1 W First Period: 2-1 (2 pts: Josh Heimbach - 1; Adam Havens - 1) Second Period: 2-1 (no goals) Third Period: 4-1 (2 pts: Trey Snow - 1; Josh Heimbach - 1) Notes: TONS of penalties in this game! obviously this NM team was better at kicking ass than they were scoring goals.  lots of roughing, interference calls!  one misconduct for Jimmy Hunter.  We outshot them 27 to 11. Drinkwater was the star once again as goalie. 1 PPG for Taos and 2 for Coppell.   Third Game: Coppell vs. Desert Vista Thunder (Arizona)  Final Score: 8-3 W First Period: 2-1 (2 pts: Trey Snow -1, Jimmy Meyer - 1) Second period: 5-1 (3 pts: Trey Snow - 2, Mark Gillings - 1) Third Period: 8-3 (3 pts: Trey Snow - 2, Jimmy Meyer - 1) Notes: Not many penalties this game, 3 for Arizona and zero for Coppell.  Another Hat trick plus 2 more goals for Trey Snow, one goal short of getting 2 hat tricks in one game!!  This kid was rocking the ice rink!  At least this team kinda put up a fight against us by putting points up on the scoreboard. Ozowski played this game which is probably why 3 goals actually got in. One power play goal for Coppell in this game. Outshot them 61 to 24.   Fourth Game: Coppell vs. Monarch Hockey Club (Colorado)  Final Score: 1-0 W First Period: 0-0 Second Period: 0-0 Third Period: 1-0 (1 pt: Trey Snow at 3:08 into the third) Notes: It appears that this game was the one and only challenging game for Coppell of the entire tourney.  No goals in the first and second and then in the third Trey Snow saves the day by scoring a goal on a probably rare scoring chance with assists from Josh Heimbach and Ashcon Habibi.  3 penalties for Coppell and 1 for Colorado, probably a smart hockey low key game.  We outshot them 32 to 19 and the only goal was not a PPG.  Drinkwater was also the goalie for this game.     Fifth game: Coppell vs. Jackson Hole Beavers (Wyoming....wow i wouldn't want to play on this team)  Final Score: 3-2 W First Period: 2-1 (2 pts: Trey Snow) Second Period: 2-1 (no new goals) Third Period: 3-2 (1pt: Brandon Kukla - his first of the tourney) Notes: seems like this was a pretty tight game.  It got close at times....and it says on the site that it went into to OT but thats not what the game summary reflects.  Anyways, even though these people were from  Wyoming  and were called the  Beavers , it obviously didn't stop their play.  The penalty count was pretty average, most of them being the norm for Coppell.  Again we outshot them 33 to 18 and Drinkwater was also in goal.  Those goals had better been wicked awesome or there was a problem with Drinkwater.  1 PPG for Coppell and 0 for Wyoming.   ~~~ All in all, i think they did rather well throughout this entire tourney! Now Coppell has double games this week due to the rescheduling of the Marcus game that was supposed to occur on the Thursday of Spring Break!  We play Marcus on Tuesday at 7:30pm and Flower Mound on Thursday at 8.  Then we start playoff season!!!!!!  yaaaaay!!!  alright i gotta go!  Best of luck in starting school after spring break, ~~~Taylor~~~

In other news, i saw this really hot lacrosse player when i got off the metro.....and we made eye contact and all that and i winked at him.  Of course he grins and is all showing off with his lacrosse stick thing after that! it was so much fun!!!!  hehehe, the metro totally rocks!  gotta go!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      5th day of spring break: DC totally rocks!!! oh man, everything is so cool here!!!  i rode the train in the METRO!!!!  it was sooo tight!!  i fell into this really hot guy who caught me and all.....oh yeah, it was a good day.    We watched "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" today as well as Monday, but my brothers said the really funny things when we watched it on monday.  Here we go:  girl in the movie: no i don't want to live in a world without love or beauty or truth! i want to live and love with you Miles! Miles, i want to have your children! guy: i know i know, i want our children too.... dillon: if some girl said "i want to have your children" to me, i think i'd run away garik: for real, thats just another way for her to tie that miles guy down. don't do it Miles!!! run away!  or this one where the characters were taking amphetamines to stay awake...  guy in movie: here take this, it'll keep you awake! garik: yeah lets pop the speed baby and get crazy! where da club at!  where all my bawlers at!?  That whole thing was really really funny.  I love my brothers, they're awesome! and they're only 10 and 13...they pick it all up from me i guess, lol.  I went to the International Spy Museum and the National Museum of Natural History....they were awesome!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      4th day of spring break: 3 more days!!!! DC is pretty tight, its a big city and its cool.  Thank goodness we won't be staying in Williamsburg for much longer, i don't know if i can take much more of that.  My mom wants to tour Thomas Jefferson's house on friday on our way back to williamsburg....i don't know if i can tour one more house and listen to them ramble about the wallpaper.  Hopefully she'll be too tired and abandon the idea.  I think tomorrow we're visiting the Smithsonian museum or whatever.  That'll be cool.    Sports Update: OMG so pissed off! So the stars are leading for most of the game and we get to the last 5 mins 3-0 and we're about to shut them out......and then SJ scores 3 goals and we tie in OT.  ARGH!!!!  Mo was better so i know Britt was happy, i'm glad his bruise on his foot healed up quick.  I can't believe we tied!!!  Argh!  So now we're 3 pts behind SJ.  Coppell plays Marcus 8pm in Valley Ranch this thursday!!!  See you guys!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      Third Day of Springs Break:  4 more days until i get home!  thank god!  we go to DC tomorrow, i hope its more interesting than Williamsburg!  I watched "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" yesterday....it was hysterical!  I was laughing for most of the movie! yeah so, please god make my feet stop hurting from all the traipsing through old houses my mom made my family go through today.....it was so evil you guys, you have no idea.  EVERY HOUSE WE WENT IN, the people were like "This is a replica of the original wallpaper" or "this chair is original" or whatever.  It got soooo old after awhile.    Stars won 4-0 over Chicago....i think that was the team.....well they won so who cares!  Mike Modano, Britt's future husband broke his ankle or something, so we hope he gets better.  Next game is vs. San Jose, who we definitley need to take down.  Good luck yet again to my Coppell Boys in Colorado, i know you'll kick ass!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      alright finished the 2nd day of spring break yesterday.....yeah it was interesting. The College of William and Mary was pretty nice, there were alot of old buildings and literally no one walking around.  The historical district had some cool stuff like a place where you could buy handmade colonial soap.  I bought a shirt and some pants from the College of W&M store and then got some gifts for people from the Cheese Store.  No, the gifts i got were not cheese.  They had Ritter Sport chocolate at this one store!!!!  I bought a few bars because that is THE BEST chocolate EVER.  mmmmm minty ritter sport, i can't wait until marni sends me more from germany.  They also have these things called "Hangover Drops" which i hear from the locals that really work when you encounter a hangover.  I actually bought a box, just in case, lol.  Not that i'll use it often or anything..... :)  Yeah my mom already signed us up for these activities in the historical district.  I'm sure it'll be interesting at some parts but painfully boring in others.  I can't wait until we get to DC, it'll be tight with the Smithsonian and all.    alright i gotta go!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~  P.S.- good luck to my coppell cowboys at their colorado tourney!

      First Day of Spring Break: Beginning in Virginia All i can say: TOO MANY TREES I think they need to clip it back a little bit! Actually, so far, it hasn't been that bad here.  Except my mom has been annoying, but thats normal for her.  I think this vacation won't be a total flop.  There are just other places i wish i could be for spring break....if you know me, you know what i'm talking about and specific activities i would be participating in, lol!  nothing bad, just more entertaining than Virginia with my family.  While i'm here i get to visit colleges, which is cool.  I need to start looking around anyways.    Yeah now i got gotta go because i'm actually supposed to be looking at Virginia colleges' websites right now.  You guys be safe over Spring Break!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~  P.S.- i come back this saturday and thats when we party, lol :)

      yeah so i'm writing this as my last will and testament before i go to Virginia for spring break with my family.  Why don't i really want to go?  because there's nothing in Virginia.  95% of the people i've told "yeah i'm going to virginia for spring break" have said "what the hell is in Virginia?".  NOTHING is in Virginia is the bottom line.  You ever wonder why the colonists from Jamestown had kids and then those kids went to go settle out west?  Because they realized NOTHING WAS FREAKING IN VIRGINIA.  So they went to California, lol, and realized they could create stuff like DisneyLand and Rodeo Drive and it would be so much super cooler than Virginia.  Thats the history cliffnotes by Taylor, thank you for your time.  My dad is bringing his laptop so i can have communication with the rest of the world and keep you updated on my boredom status.  Thank god for that, but no promise i'll actually be able to talk much since my freaking mom will probably monitor me and all this.  We could've gone anywhere in the world........Finland, Norway, England, Ibiza, Brazil......but she picks Virginia.  Do i care about American history?  to a point, but i find world history so much more interesting.  I think i'll be bringing tons of books to read/music to listen to and homework to keep myself occupied.    In other news, i got a 1040 on my PSAT.  Go me!  I rock!  So techinically, as of now, i could get into a junior college!  Just think how much better my scores will be after i take Algebra II!!!!    Sports Update: Coppell kicks the hell out of Jesuit 6-1!!!!!!!!!  It was so awesome and we were 7 players short.  It was brilliant and i'm very proud of my boys.  Dallas also tied 2-2 with Philadelphia, which means we're 3 points away from overtaking San Jose!!!  We will catch up, i know we will.  Coppell plays Marcus over Spring Break which i'm going to miss because i'll be in freaking virginia.  Tell me how it goes you guys, so i'll know how my boys are doing!  I'm sure it'll be a win.  Good luck to the cowboys at their tourney in Colorado!!  Kick those yankees' asses!!    Blonde Kid with no fashion sense: he wore the ugly jacket.  i think his relationship with that broad is over.  lol that reminds me of something funny that happened lunch.  i was telling taylor stewart all about this kid that me and lauren stalked and i was like "yeah he's been hanging out with this total broad" and she's like "Broad?".  I had to explain to her that a broad is a slut, particularly a hockey whore.  Taylor says "So wait, hockey players have their own private prostitution group?".  LOL!!!  I was like "yeah generally".  hehe, good times.  alright, i need to go pack for my death trip.  i can only pray that there will be hot guys to keep my mind busy while i learn about good old american history......  Be safe on spring break!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      oh man, for about all of 3rd and 4th period, i was so unbelievably angry at Mr. Dixon it was even funny.  Why? because he told me that my shirt wasn't passing dress code when it was! My entire class was even like "what the hell? your shirt does pass dress code".  Maxanne, this girl in my class, said "if your shirt is low cut then mine is super low cut".  He said that my shirt was too low cut and my midriff was showing when in reality the shirt i was wearing was one of the few that doesn't show my midriff at least a little bit and it was not low cut.  So he gave me one of those stupid dress code passes to go the office with.  I went to Mrs. Springer and told her what happened and how my shirt did pass and the 2 APs that were with her agreed that it did etc....and she sent me with a note that said my shirt was ok and i had to sit in Mrs. Phillips office for the 5 mins left in the period.  I was sooo mad though because he embarassed me in front of the entire class.  I swear he is such a child and it bothers me.  Its one thing to act funny and kid around but you should know when to act serious and say something to a student privatley depending on the topic.  There were better ways he could've handled it.  And there were some people in my class that were not passing dress code period, but he picks on me! I think he seriously hates me and he underestimates my intelligence.  I think that he thinks i'm just another one of those stupid bimbo girls that don't know a thing about history and could care less which is not true about me at all.  I was the 4th girl he had sent all day.    Yeah so i have 2 tests and 2 quizzes tomorrow......should i study? yeah. am i studying? no.  Coppell vs Jesuit tonight, 9:30pm, *prays*  One more day and then spring break! ~~~Taylor~~~

      jeez i haven't updated since monday.........sorry kids, it was an accident.  i told you guys i have unconscious selective chronic amnesia, lol!   yeah so that double hw thing from monday.....i was supposed to turn it in today but i forgot and i'm hoping that Dixon forgot and we can just turn it in tomorrow.  Because if not, its a zero that i have to work extra hard to fix my grade for.  I mean, i still have the rest of the tri, but still.....i don't want it to screw over my grade!  The first test is tomorrow and i'm pretty sure i'll do well on it.  The material is pretty easy and i did the review, i feel pretty confident in it.  oh yeah i got an message on dixon's message board from Farhan.....he says there's probably no way i can turn it in now and that i'm screwed.  Gee thanks Farhan, lol.  He's not even in my class though, so i'm still going to attempt to turn it in.  And if Mr. Dixon says its still a zero, then its my fault and i'll just have to make sure in the future that i remember to turn stuff in.  Besides, its only one daily grade out of all the other 100s i've gotten and will get.    Sports Update: yeah so Dallas lost 4-0 to the crappiest team in the entire NHL with a whopping 35 points (which is approx. 17 wins and 1 tie), the Pittsburgh Penguins.  It was sad.  I mean seriously, it takes an effort to lose to Pittsburgh.  Did anyone see the replay of that Todd Bertuzzi of Vancouver hit to Steven Moore of Colorado?!?!  It broke Moore's neck!!!  It was so deliberate and Bertuzzi should be suspended for the rest of the season.  I heard on the national news (surprising that it even made national news) that they're taking it to criminal court and he might be charged with assault and battery!  I hope he is, i never really liked him anyways.  The entire scrap was entirely uncalled for because Moore wasn't doing anything!  oh yeah, Coppell plays Jesuit at 9:30pm.........we're going to be down 7 players.  i'm scared already.  I don't know if we're going to win.  Honestly, if we win, it'll be a miracle.  I just hope that if we lose it won't be that bad.    please please please let the cowboys win tomorrow!!  *prays*, ~~~Taylor~~~

      hmmm nothing happened today.  I was a little pissed off that i didn't check the stupid blackboard.com thing to see my hw for history and now i have to do double history hw.  argh.  I had fun rubbing it into Steven Danby's face today about that Calgary vs. Dallas game he went to on Friday and that Calgary lost terribly in, 5-1.  But Calgary beat Colorado yesterday, 7-1, so they can't be sucking that bad.  Colorado plays Vancouver tonight, anyone want to take bets on how bad they'll lose?  Dallas plays Pittsburgh tomorrow....ha, like they should even try to lose, it would take an effort to lose to pittsburgh.    Blonde Kid with no fashion sense update: hurrah! my column has been revived!!!  Lately, the kid has been doing well with this clothing....maybe this new broad that he's been hanging out with has changed his style.  So far everything has matched and he's even been wearing BELTS which is completely revolutionary for him, considering he did NOT wear those last tri.  The sandals with socks and even the ugly tan jacket has left his wardrobe lately.  Amazing what a girl can do to a guy in a few short weeks.  Even though i don't approve of the relationship, even if its friends, that he has with this broad......its better for him in the sense of his wardrobe, lol  yay i get to help Lindsay with her newspaper article on hockey!!!  i get to be quoted and i get to help her write it!!! And i'm not even in newspaper!!!  This is awesome.......i get quoted in the newspaper for hockey, then i get to be in the yearbook for hockey when it comes out!!!  lol, i'm sure my picture will be really stupid when its in the yearbook, i probably look like i'm going insane or something....  gotta go!

      haha i forgot to update on my saturday night.  it was interesting, very interesting.  i would just like to say that i survived Austin driving me home.  it was scary but i made it.  i had a great time with Ingrid and Ro and the gang!  we played volleyball and then we ate hot pockets.  oh yeah and then we walked around in circles for awhile.  a great quote from Austin: "What the point of asses if they can't be looked at?!?!".  Nice, Austin.  sorry, i didn't feel like using caps in this paragraph.  Me and my mom were rebels today.  We told me dad that we were going out to get makeup and milk when we really went out for dinner.  It was fun.  We bonded and all that and my dad had no idea.  We were so rebellious!  I wore a skirt today because my wicked awesome bruises from playing goalie with no pads last month are gone now.  *tear* i loved those bruises so much!  Stars won today 4-0 over San Jose!!!!  yaaaaaay!!!!  We got 2 goals in the first 8 mins of the first period and SJ didn't get their first shot on goal until after 10-12 mins.  We beat them down!!!!  It was tight.  In other news, Colorado has lost every game since February 16th.  Haha you suck Colorado!!!  except Paul Kariya, because he's adorable.  They lost 7-1 to Calgary today and Vancouver is 1 point from taking them over.  Yeah, so today was an awesome day.  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      lalalalala......i went to church this morning and i actually had the mental strength to put on eye liner this morning.  Thats amazing!  yeah and vote for Jake Ross on Nadia's poll called "Who's the sexiest man alive?"  because Jake is my buddy and he's awesome, lol.  I drove today and did fine but my mom swears i almost killed some people including ourselves.  I swear i had complete control of the car.  We weren't going to die.    Sports Update: Dallas plays San Jose today and if we win, we're 2 points (one win) away from taking SJ down.  It's on now.  Coppell plays Jesuit this week, which is a game you definitley want to go to because its the last one and it'll be extreme.  The only problem is that its at 9:30pm......but you should try to come anyways.  I'm more than likely going to go and i'm going to kidnap Brittany if her parents don't let her go.  And then Brittnee the Lariette is probably going too because its later at night.  Allison will more than likely go if she doesn't have a soccer game.  I'll be missing the Coppell vs. Marcus game over spring break, but we're going to win that one for sure so its all cool.    hmmmm i should probably be studying and rereading the chapter for world history.....but i think i'll wait and do it later.....after the hockey game....and maybe later after that....

      PSAT needs to die.....yes it wasn't the real SAT as i accidently said yesterday.  I thought most of it was pretty easy except for a few math problems.  My score prediction: 1100 and under.  And here is the brilliant part of my day: I GOT ALL A'S ON MY REPORT CARD!!!!! FOR 6WKS AND TRI!!!!!  This is something i haven't done since......well so long that i can't remember.  I've always been pretty much an A-B student because of stupid math.  Who has gold renaissance? i have gold renaissance!  its awesome, made the whole day alot better.    Dude, everyone is getting married lately.  I've been invited to 2 weddings in the past month.  Lisa (the secretary at my dad's office and one of my friends when i worked there) and Clark (her boyfriend of about 2 years and fiance) are getting married on April 10th.  I'm possibly missing the City Semi-finals for her wedding, but i might be able to go considering that her church is literally right next door to the Frisco DPSC.  Vivian (another friend from my dad's office) and Brad (her high school sweetheart from when she went to Coppell High School back in 90-something) are getting married on July 24th.  its crazy, i'm going to be broke!  oh well, its cool.  Just in case any of you kids were wondering, i've got the playoff schedule for the remainder of the Coppell Hockey season.....in which if we go to State, we might take it all home for the second time in a row on my birthday!!!! April 18th in case you wanted to know.  Alright here's how the rest of the season goes:  Regular Season: * vs. Jesuit - Valley Ranch DPSC, 9:30pm, 3/11  * vs. Marcus - Valley Ranch, 8pm, 3/18  * vs. Flower Mound - Valley Ranch, 8pm, 3/25  Playoff Season (here's where it counts): * Section Semi-Finals: 3/30, Valley Ranch, 7pm  * Section Finals: 4/6, Valley Ranch, 8:30pm (i predict Jesuit) * Section Championship: 4/8, Valley Ranch, 7pm  * City Semi-Finals: 4/10, Frisco DPSC, 3pm  * Metroplex 3rd place: 4/13, 7pm, Frisco  * Metroplex Championship: 4/13, 8:30pm Frisco  * State Championship: April 16th-18th in Frisco, there are no times yet.  Pretty much its like quarterfinals on the 16th, semis on the 17th and the big game on the 18th which is where one team will take it all home, hopefully Coppell ****Remember, whether we win metroplex or not, we still go to state....i almost hope that we don't because Southlake did that and look where they ended up.  Alright and now its time for friend story of the week: the late edition:   Liz Whiting, the Great One  I met Liz in second tri, third period of Masengill's PreAp geography class freshman year.  I had recently broke it off with most of my friends from west because i didn't really like the way they were treating me, so i was kinda still vulnerable and a little intimidated by people which is not normal for me.  Liz sat behind me and i noticed that she was rather loud like me.  I would always turn around to talk to Jessica and Liz would always say something "mean" to me and make me turn back around.  I didn't realize this was the way her sense of humor worked so i thought she was this really bitchy girl.  Slowly but surely though, we became pretty close friends in that class.  Me and her had so many inside jokes together from lunch that every time somebody said something, it was one of our jokes and we'd laugh for several minutes uncontrollably.  Our famous one was the "working-the-nightshift-and seducing-niko-kapanen-for-dallas-stars-tickets-and-access-to-their-locker-rooms" running joke which still lives on today.  It all started when me and Sarah were joking around about seducing Prince William to take out Prince Charles so Wills could be King....long story, don't ask.  Then we told Liz and it quickly evolved into what would happen if we seduced Niko for dallas stars tickets and access to the locker rooms and then it got corrupted even more when we started talking about seducing coppell hockey players for access to their locker rooms.  it was really really funny and we'd laugh at everything that reminded us of it and masengill would always ask us if we were on crack....which sometimes i wonder if unknowingly we were.  We also formed "The Nikettes" which were the fanclub of Niko.....when actually i was the only one that really knew what he looked like.  Liz and I also had the best moment of glory EVER for anyone in that high school at lunch.  We danced in the store at lunch.  Yes, thats right, the song "Working at the Car Wash" came on and we started disco dancing with our sweet tarts and rollos in front of EVERYONE.  even some hot guys.  That was our famous moment at lunch, after that they never played the song again in the store but people remembered us for that.  Me and Liz never did a project together or anything for that class....we just sat around at lunch and made dirty jokes like the nightshift one, puberty stricken black guy, what happens when a guy crosses his legs (illustrated by isaac), "convincing" isaac to show us his package (that was so liz, not me lol) and so on and so forth.  When me and Liz get together, leave the room if you get grossed out too easily.  Alright so on with the story.  Over Spring Break last year, Liz, me and Sarah all came over to my house and stayed up for 36 hours in a row.  It was our acheivement of the night.  Me and Liz took coke bottles and walked around my neighbourhood and to Chuan's house acting like we were drunk.  We toasted to everything that walked.  Chuan wasn't there so we came back to my house and made our "Whats Kapanen?" shirts in honor of our second tri together.  "Whats Kapanen" is another one of our famous jokes along with coffee!, el liz-o, el duane-o, WHM club, we own finland, we love the 80's etc.  So our shirts were all painted and we had to finish them that night because Sarah had to leave at the crack of dawn (aka 10pm) the next morning.  We finished our shirts, took a 30 MINUTE power nap and then walked the mile to McDonalds from my house at 7:30 to get some food.  We almost got run over twice and we felt sick eating all that food on the way back.  People, again, probably thought we were drunk or had hangovers because we looked like it.  We also knew that Randy Andy aka Andrew Gabel lived in my neighbourhood somewhere so we went up and down the streets singing "Oh Canada" at the top of our lungs.  Thats how tight me and Liz are, we do stupid things together and tell everyone how stupid we were.  We also "wrapped" Masengill's house when his baby was born....that was fun.  I love Liz, my nirvana lol, to death and i don't know what i'd do without her!  She brought out the extreme stupidity and inner drunkiness in me and now we're always really really incompetent together.  She is the Great One and i love her forever!!!  remember the freshman year Liz, it will never die, lol!  Alright kids, girl scout cookies call my name and i must eat them.  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      hmmm.......i haven't really updated this in a record 4 days!!!!  scary, my classes were so boring that they made me uncontrollably tired and i didn't update! sorry!  Here's an update of the week:  Tuesday: boring!  mr. fleming continues to review how to make nametags FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK!!! Wednesday: boring and then i went over to Britt's house for the hockey game which the stars won 4-1 i think.....although with my chronic amnesia i can't really remember....i watched this making of the movie Miracle show and then the SportsCentury: Jim Craig.....it was fun Thursday: boring and then i went to the Coppell Hockey game vs. LD Bell......yeah Haley, i would just like to say that we DID kick you guys' asses 9-1!!!!  I told you we would!  Ah man, LD Bell had the most ghetto-looking hockey jerseys i think i've ever seen from a high school hockey team....they looked like they popped out of the 80's!!!  lol, yeah it was a pretty good game.  The most beautiful goal of the game was by Ashcon Habibi.....and it was so beautiful that i can't eve describe it, you just had to be there to see it.    And today, i am going to a hockey-jessica's puppy party at Jessica's house.  I can't sleep over because i have the freaking SAT tomorrow.....DIE SAT!!!!  I swear, it interferes with my life.  And i'm just going to get below a 1000 like i always do because i suck at math.  Of course, they have to start the SAT at the crack of dawn which for me....is 8:00.  And then it freaking runs until 12.  i hate it with a passion and i can't wait until i just get into freaking college and i don't have to worry about it anymore.    because of the SAT and church this means i will get absolutely no sleeping late this weekend.......oh joy  Now i must run and i'll write up a friend story of the week on Liz Whiting, the Great one and post it on here when i get a chance.  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      Kendra informed me that i forgot an inside joke from Disciple Now that was very funny: "Do you snore? you should wear a jockstrap." said by, the one and only, Kendra!  First day of the Tri is always boring.  Thank god this is the last tri of the year, i don't know how much i could take.  I've decided that this tri, i'm not going to procrastinate and put things off as much as i did last tri.  I'm going to work so i can feel satisfied with myself.....no, actually, i just want all A's.    Lunch is awesome this tri because me and Brittnee have lunch together for the first time EVER!!!!!  yaaaaaaaaaaay!!!!!  And Lauren, Nathaniel, Taylor (stewart), Lindsay, and Katie all have my lunch!!!!  its going to be a party lunch for sure.  Here's the best part.  THE BLONDE KID WITH NO FASHION SENSE IS IN MY LUNCH!!!!!  yaaaaaaaaaay!!!!  So that article of my blog lives on and i know you all enjoy it, lol.  Today he wore my favorite blue shirt with the white letters on it that looks soooo good on him.  Why is this my favorite? C'mon, the kid only wears 5 shirts a week and they're the same every week, so i can have a favorite.  Of course he had to ruin it with the ugly tan jacket, but thats cool.  Tomorrow me and Lauren are going to the store to inspect who all is in our lunch.    I met this girl named Rachna in my BCIS class this tri, she's really funny.  But she'll never replace my Kate McAdams!!!!  Kaler, Ashley and Hayem are in my class also.  Its the great reunion of Kaler and Taylor!!!!!  It'll be so awesome, we'll reminisce on all the good times in PreAp biology last year!  Mr. Allen doesn't like us already because we talk across the room.  Oh well.  It'll be an awesome class.  lalalalalalala i have nothing else to write.......because nothing really happened today  Best of luck with the new tri, ~~~Taylor~~~

      wow i haven't updated in 4 days!!!  sorry but TAKS has totally drained any possible energy from me because i was taking practice tests and studying so i'd remember everything since the stupid TAKS people feel the need to ask questions about stuff from years ago.  I felt like such a terribly american while taking the social studies TAKS test because i couldn't remember very much of basic american history without tons of thought.  Math TAKS wasn't that bad, but Science TAKS was freaking hard.  OMG i didn't remember anything, i guessed on half the questions.......hello TAKS Remedial!!!!    Sports Update: San Jose failed to sweep Colorado last night, which was dissappointing.  They went through a scoreless game and then Colorado scored 5 mins into OT.  My pick for cup finals, Tampa Bay, plays tonight and i hope Vincent LeCavalier (my fave on their team right now) scores a few goals like usual!!!  Martin St. Louis is cool too, he's so short!!!  Hopefully Tampa Bay will complete their sweep over Montreal (who deserves it because Boston SO outplayed them last round but due to a stupid game 7, lost out).    In other news, on Monday, i met my buddy, Jimmy, face to face for the first time ever.  It was cool, despite the fact that he already knew what i looked like etc.  What's weird is that now that i've met him, i never see him anymore!  oh well, its cool whatever  gotta go!

      alright so the recap since last time i updated......  Thursday: nothing it was sooooo boring!!!  there was no coppell game to watch, it was so depressing....  Friday: i went ice skating with Jessi and co.  It was fun but the ice was terrible!!!  I swear, there were canyons in the ice.  I told Taylor Kubic that if i ever dated him, it would be like incest because he's so much like my brother.....he thought that was funny.  All in all, a good night. Nathalie also told me that there's a possibility that Coppell might still have the chance at a state title....she heard it from mark gillings and i dunno how reliable he is as a source.....but basically she told me that Plano Wesst cheated in a way because they were playing a guy that had been suspended for grades...and apparently he scored 2 of plano west's goals in the game where they played us.  Since they cheated they should have to forfeit all the games in which he played where he was supposed to be suspended and in other words all those games, including games at state, would be counted as losses.  In other words, they can't have won state because they'd have to forfeit it.  Apparently, according to Mark whom Nathalie heard from, this whole ordeal is under review by the league and they might either make us play Clear Lake for the title or make Clear Lake automatic champion.....although that might mess up who gets 2nd or 3rd place at state.....i dunno its confusing. But that would be so awesome if that happened!    Saturday: i had my sweet 16 party!!!  it was fun! we hung out, watched movies and swapped stories!! we partied hard, lol!  we had this dancing circle etc and me and mary were trying to teach people how to freak dance....except it wasn't really working lol.  But we will help you!!!  You kids will go clubbing with us when we're 18!!! I got like 5 awesome purses, 2 cool cds, a "hockey" blanket, and some other stuff, it was tizite  and today, i drove to walmart and kohl's by myself......it was jam-packed with action  gotta go!

      OMG!!!!  YESTERDAY WAS THE BEST DAY EVER!!!!!! Alright so Brittnee and me and everyone else who was there for her party were at the mall.  We were doing this video scavenger hunt and stuff and now i will give you the play by play of how i met 2 of the Dallas Stars!!!:  Brittnee: hey look cute guys, lets go talk to them and ask them to do something stupid! Everyone: ok! Brittnee: *walks up to guys* Hey its my birthday blah blah blah...... Me: Hey wait a minute! You're Antti Miettinen!!! Antti: *smiles* Yeah i am. Me: You play for the Dallas Stars! Antti: Yes, i do. Me: Omg, my friend thinks you're so awesome!  You're her fave hockey player! Antti: Oh thats cool Me: *turns to guy thats grinning at me* And you're Mattias Tjarnqvist! Mattias: *smiles* I am. Me: Wow this is so awesome! You guys are both so great! Everyone else: Who are these people!!?! Me: *explains who they are* Antti: So you're a hockey fan? Me: Yeah Everyone: don't even get her started.... Me: *turns to Mattias* Can i shake your hand? Mattias: Yeah sure....*gives me this weak handshake but smiles anyways* Me: *turns to Antti* Can i shake your hand too? Antti: Sure, of course! *shakes my hand with strong handshake and smiles* Me: *thinking "omg you're so hot..."* Other guys with Antti and Mattias: ok we have to go..... Antti: bye! Mattias: *waves*  Brittnee got all pissed off/irritated because she said that i scared them away except i don't think she heard me when i tried to tell her that a) they don't speak english, b) they're foreign and c) they're shy and those are most of the reasons why they wouldn't do what she wanted them to do on camera.  She also didn't really hear me when i tried to tell her that they were developing players and they weren't famous or anything.  I'm just a huge stars fan and thats how i know who they are.  So while Britt was all irritated or whatever, everyone else told me to forget it because it wasn't that big of a deal.  So whatever, i got to meet 2 Dallas Stars that were really hot!!!  So i got my license yesterday too.  I've been driving all over the place now!!  Its so awesome.  I've had my license for not even 2 days now and i've:  * done 4 illegal U-turns * went at least 20 mph over the speed limit (Its Jessica's fault because she's bad at lying! lol) * Backed into a mailbox (Nadia, who put that mailbox right by your house!?!  Thats a stupid place for a mailbox!  thank god that my dad has that spare tire on that back or the car would've been screwed!) * broken at least 10 traffic laws  oh yes, so much fun having your license......aah the memories already.  Now Nathaniel wants me to give him a ride so he can see how good i am at driving.....except he's probably going to make fun of me then entire time for backing into that mailbox within my first hour of having my license and speeding really bad within the first 2 hrs.  And then he'll probably purposely run me into a mailbox JUST so he can laugh at me.  Lol jk, Nathaniel would never do that.  Yeah so my reasearch paper is finished!!!  Thank god!!!  Now i can finally NOT do hw period.  Gotta go!   Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      ITS MY 16TH BIRTHDAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Finally i can frickin drive and i can be happy with my independence.  Too bad that state was not won on my birthday this year, i've shed my tears (against my will) and i'll move on.  We got 4th place because we lost 3-2 in overtime.  It sucked.  I would just like to say that i am a dedicated coppell hockey fan because i went to the 8 in the frickin AM game to watch my boys' final game.  They played like shit, but i don't blame them for doing so.  I'll be ok though, i just want my boys to know that i love them and that they're awesome and we had a good season this year despite the loss of state.  So the agenda for today is: 1. buy brittnee's bday present 2. go to brittnee's birthday party in which supposedly something is going to happen to me because my birthday is first lol 3. tell my boys that they're still awesome even thought they lost.....i hope they don't get too drunk tonight.....  After the game, my mommy took me and Brittnee out to breakfast and she comforted us because we were all bummed that Coppell lost.  So it was cool.    Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      yeah......coppell lost 4-2 to Plano West.  and whats amusing here is that literally 4 days ago we beat the 3-0.  What pisses me off is that Marlo said that we wouldn't win state again and then we don't.  aaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrghhhhhhh!!!!!   it was shit.  we played like shit and i knew this would happen.  We win regionals, win metroplex but then we don't win state because we got too cocky.  I told them so! no one ever listens to me!!!  We're reliving what southlake carroll went through last year!!!  I told them "winning metroplex is the kiss of death, southlake wins it and everyone thinks they're going to win state and then they don't!  i'm worried, i don't want us to win!".  Then Josh and Jimmy say "oh no, have faith, we'll do fine, we'll win".  or not.  So no we're off to third place game tomorrow, oh joy.  4 words to my boys: I TOLD YOU SO.  They did this to themselves.  They partied the night before and then they were running on like no sleep blah blah blah.......my boys let me down, and i weep for them.  Despite the fact that we won't win state on my birthday now, at least i'm still turning 16 and i'll be able to drive.  thank god. Now i can go have fun and comfort myself for Coppell's loss.  Oh yeah Dallas lost their series, not a surprise.  I actually didn't watch the game.  I didn't feel like it.  New Jersey also lost their series, the same way Dallas did.  So its alright.  Now i'm cheering for Boston or Tampa Bay, just because they're awesome and they have hott guys.  I would just like to say that i will miss my Niko Kapanen and my Patrik Elias, i hope their summer will be alright.    tomorrow is my birthday!!!!!!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      as i sit here, sarah is dancing with my star pillow.....she's turning it into a rapper......yeah, we're acting pretty high right now lol......  We were talking to Nathaniel and then he died or something.....then we talked to some david kid that sarah knows....and then he signed off and then we talked to other people i don't know.....but yeah then they all signed off too so here we are planning to make a music video and we're waiting for the camera to charge.  Hockey game was awesome.  We won 4-1.  Although our passing could've been a little better and Michael's stick was short....yeah it was funny.  We went partied after that at Boston's where i got free ice cream for my birthday from my fave and official waiter, Kenny.  We talked about how his gf totally embarassed him and he told us funny stories.  He said some pretty funny stuff that i have quoted.....see the profile for details.  Lol then we made up this thing called "Anti Dating Points", Sarah was the winner aka loser.  it was funny.  After we partied at Boston's, we went to Sarah's house to pick up her stuff.....Britty couldn't join us because she had to clean her room etc. *tear*  We got "drunk" in the new bathroom of Sarah's house with her mom while we swapped stories.  It was great. Then my brother and his friend hung out in the car while this happened.  So then we got back in the car and went home.  Sarah laid on my bed and fell in love with my star pillow......and decided to make it freak dance to songs on the radio.  We decided to make a movie about it but got distracted.  hey Nathaniel's talking again and he thinks me and Sarah are high/drunk.  go us, acheived life goal.    so the cam is probably charged now, and we can go.  If any of what we just wrote makes absolutely no sense.....its because we are so mentally drained from laughing at our stupidity that we can't think straight.  its like being high on life.  gotta go!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~  P.s- Sarah says we're high on hockey....the non stop hockey love

      school was boring today.........you know what i should just stop talking about school because everyday i say like the same thing.  I've decided that i will rely solely on my photographic memory for the rest of the tri (which is only 6 more weeks!!!!) and not study or really do my homework.  I told this freshman girl in my BCIS class who was freaking out about gpa's etc that if i really did all of my work with my best effort and full potential then i would probably be in the top 10% or so......but i'm not because i don't care enough to waste my time trying.  I told her since she was Asian, she can do anything and she thought that was really funny.  She was like "omg i can't do Ap blah blah blah" and i was like "You're Asian, you can make it in the top 10% without thinking."  Yeah, so no more work for taylor......except in PreAp history and then after this research paper is done, no more work in PreAp english.  hurrah!  so i'm still in the predicament of my best friend planning her birthday party on my birthday......and then my mom told me i was having a family dinner for my birthday on that day anyways.....so yeah.    TOMORROW IS FIRST DAY OF STATE HOCKEY TOURNEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Tomorrow at 5:45pm we play the Woodlands......we're going to have to leave school quick!  Its going to be soooooooo awesome!!!  I love my boys and i know they won't let me down!!!  Oh yeah and Stars lost in double OT in Game 4.  Yeah and that stupid Marek Svatos of Colorado just got a frickin lucky shot!!!  grrrr..   So now the stars are pretty much screwed and it appears that this series will turn out just like the Anaheim series last year.  oh joy.  that means my Niko will either be traded or i won't see him for a good 4-5 months.    oh yeah and Emily wants me to make a sign to bring to state that says "Kiss Taylor, Its her birthday".......but i don't think thats such a good idea.  lol.  don't want anyone getting any ideas.....  3 more days man.....and then i can drive!!!!!!!!!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      COPPELL COWBOYS ARE METROPLEX CHAMPIONS!!!!!!!!  BEAT PLANO WEST 3-0!!!!!!  GOOOOOOO COWBOYS!!! of course, i was there with Britty, Ashley and Lindsay because we love our boys. :) That, so far, is the only good thing of my week.  Besides the fact that i got extremely angry at Jimmy for calling me a puck bunny (when he knows fully well that i'm not) and then he claims that he was "just kidding", one of my best friends (or does she remember that?  maybe that was erased when she became a lariette also) plans her 16th birthday party on my 16th birthday which is the 18th of April.  Then she insults my love for hockey by saying that if i want to go to the hockey game that sunday (which is MY birthday so i can do whatever the hell i want) then its "whatever".  At this point, i almost don't want to go to her party nor do i have to because its MY BIRTHDAY and i can do whatever i want.  Ashley was kinda trying to calm me down by saying that it was possible that she forgot, but then aren't we best friends?  shouldn't she remember??!?!!  I mean even if she moved her entire part etc (which she wouldn't but whatever) the pain would still be there that she forgot my birthday.  And this is has been going on all year, where ever since she's become a lariette, she's been bitchy to me and to other people, insulted my interests, told me what i can and cannot do etc etc.  I dunno but i'm getting the feeling that lariettes corrupts people.  aaaaaaggggghhhhhh i am so unbelievably angry right now, its not even funny.  yeah so Stars play Game 4 tonight and they better frickin win or the entire week is lost.  until friday which is opening state day!!!  but yeah, whatever.    Besides my incredible anger towards 2 people, i miss some people a whole whole lot.  Like i see them or talk to them often, but i miss them sooo much.  its weird.  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      ok i know i know, i haven't updated in awhile but i've been a foreign country.......actually it was arkansas.  whatever.  it sucked, but thats ok.  Sports Update: Coppell beat Carrolton/FB 3-0 amazingly.  We had poor puck movement and could hardly hold onto it.  But we won it anyways, so oh well.  Coppell goes onto play Plano West for Metroplex Champion at 8:30pm in Frisco.  I would list out the state schedule for you kids, but its too confusing so i figure i should wait until after the results for Metro.  Stars lost AGAIN to Colorado.....after we scored the first goal too.  They lost 5-2.  So now Colorado leads the series 2-0 and the stars still think they can win.....lol thats funny.  So now the only reason i'm watching is to see my Niko's final games of the season and possibly as a Dallas Star since it is probably inevitable that they will trade alot of people if we don't make it far.  Dallas plays Game 3 tonight at 7pm on Espn....anyone want to pull bets?  6 days until my birthday and i can drive!!!!!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      OMG last night was the BEST NIGHT EVER!!!!! Why? BECAUSE MY NIKO KAPANEN SCORED THE ONLY GOAL FOR DALLAS LAST NIGHT!!!  HE TOTALLY OWNS COLORADO!!!!!! yeah, i know, stars lost 3-1.....but now who frickin cares? my niko scored a goal and we could lose the entire series now and i'd still be happy.  i think we all kinda knew we were screwed from the beginning.  Anyways, what now mr. VanRiper, my Niko does not suck! Brittany thinks that the reason Niko only scores on Colorado is to piss off Riku Hahl, his best friend who plays for the Avs.  Thats actually not a bad theory, lol.  Mike Modano was kicking butt a little bit too, he got in mini fights, which is abnormal for him. Basically, if we lose on Friday, its over and we should just play with an open net because we're not coming back.  *does victory dance* but my niko still scored!!!  school was pretty cool today.  I have this project for IPC where i basically have to copy down the entire periodic table.....sounds like fun.  Oh yes and friday through sunday i'll be in Arkansas visiting family that hates me.  oh joy!  I'll miss City Finals which determines whether we go to Metro 3rd or Metro Champs game.  its cool though, the day we go back to school its metro game in frisco!    Tonight, Coppell marches on for their 2nd state cup playing Carrolton/FB for the section championship and for a place in state.  i would also like inform the masses that the common misconception that "if we don't win metroplex, we don't go to state" is NOT TRUE.  if we win tonight's game, then we'll go to state no matter what.  period.  Metro doesn't matter at that point.  thank you for your time.  gotta go, i need a nap before the game.  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      oh man i need to get back on track of updating this more!!! i've been so busy i haven't had time!!!  lemme give you an update.....  Monday: did absolutely nothing.....i guess you could say i mentally prepared myself for the jesuit game the following night  Tuesday: Coppell vs. Jesuit game.  I swear, by far, the best game of the season.  It was soooo intense and i prayed for about half of the game.  Everytime Jesuit tied it up, i started praying that they wouldn't score the next goal.  It was like pong (my fave allegory of all time, lol).....we scored, they scored, we scored, they scored, we scored.  It ended 3-2.  in that game, i said aaaaaalot of stuff i shouldn't have said.  My mouth just ran and i couldn't control it.  Every time the puck went to T.J.'s end i crossed my fingers.  I hated the refs though, they didn't let us have one of our goals.  I can't remember who all scored exactly but i definitley know that Trey Snow and Jimmy Meyer did.  Thank you god that there was only 2:30 left in the game.  I was soooo scared that we weren't going to pull it off because had we lost this game, it would've ended our season.  I love my boys and they did really well!!!!   If they can get past jesuit, they can win state again!!!    And today, i didn't do anything again.  I've got senioritis early, so i don't feel like doing anything EVER for the rest of the year.  i figure if i just half way do everything and keep low A's, i'll be fine.  Sports Update: Coppell beat Jesuit 3-2 in a close match on Tuesday night with goals from leading scorer, Trey Snow, and at least one from Jimmy Meyer.  A tight game for the cowboys as the go on the march to defend their state title and play like the regional champs that they are.  Dallas takes on Colorado tonight at 9pm who will be without Paul Kariya and several other players.  This is opening night for the Stanley Cup Run and other games going on tonight are the Calgary-Vancouver, Montreal-Boston, and Detroit-Nashville.  This is the first game of the quarterfinal series and us Dallas fans can only hope the best for them.  *prays* maybe they'll win.  alright, kids, i gtg!  oh please god let the stars win tonight and maybe possibly the entire series.  and let Coppell win state.  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      right so i didn't do much of anything this weekend.  I slept and watched movies, it was awesome.    Friday: i watched a stars game that we lost to Minnesota 4-2 because my parents wouldn't let me go anywhere.  Saturday: I slept really late and i ate junk food.  I wanted to go see "The Prince and Me" but nobody could go cause everyone's broke.  So i went to Lindsay's house and we watched "The Shining".  It was a freaking scary movie, i couldn't sleep very well that night.  It reminded me alot of Ghost Ship.  The Ring is still the scariest movie i've ever seen.  There were the twins in the shining that were really freaky and then the elevators let out this wave of blood....it was pretty nasty.  Luckily, in the end, the mom and boy got away from the crazy dad and it was a pseudo-happy ending.  There were some really funny parts in that movie though!  Like when the kid's second personality started talking, he talked with his finger.  We though something lived in his finger!!  Or when the mom ran away from stuff, she ran really weird.  Then there was this one part where the mom was running up the stairs looking for her son and she looks into this one room  and there's this guy dressed up in a MOUSE SUIT (like the guy who is the spoof character of Chewbacca in Space Balls) giving oral sex to Lloyd, the ghost bartender!!!!!!  That was soooo random and LSD-induced.....it had absolutely nothing to do with the story.  Oh but not to mention the part where the crazy dad is making out with this random COMPLETELY NAKED woman he finds in the bathroom and then he looks up and she's all moldy and DEAD!!!  And then she chases him out of the room, STILL COMPLETELY NAKED with her boobs hanging down by her waist.......omg it was soo disgusting.  I am seriously scarred for life.  So yeah i didn't sleep too well that night.  Sunday: I went out to lunch at the Deliman's grill with the family and as i was walking out i saw ADAM HAVENS walking in.  Not that he took a glance my way or anything, but he looked sooooo hot.  I love his hair, he shouldn't ever cut it.  Yeah so after that exciting bit, i went to the stars game in which i saw Emily and Lauren and their family.  It was out last stars game together before Lauren goes to college! *tear*  So we yelled and everything and totally made foold of ourselves.  They were mad that they didn't get to see my hockey team last game, lol you guys missed out!  During the intermission, i was buying ice cream with Em and Lauren and then this random guy comes and taps me on the shoulder.  I was wearing my Niko Kapanen Jersey and he asks "Now, out of all of the guys on team why did you choose to wear Kapanen's jersey?".  I said "Because i think he's cute?", i was really freaked out by this guy but he chuckled at me.  And i decided to make myself not look like such a puck bunny by saying "well he's also a really good player and i've liked him for awhile....he's my favorite!".  Em and Lauren also helped out by adding that i'm obsessed with him and i'm in love with his hair.  Thanks guys.  This guy thought that was funny and he says "Well, i'm in marketing for the stars and i just noticed your jersey and thought i'd ask about it......not many people wear this jersey and we're just trying to figure out what the fans want".  I told him that i'm probably the only person outside of Finland who wears his jersey and he thought that was funny.  He asked me if i liked Niko's hair etc and i said "yeah i love it and if you could pass on the message to him, tell him to never ever cut it all off".  lol he said ok he would try!  yaay, life is complete.  btw, stars won today 5-2 over Chicago.  lol, fun weekend eh? too bad that my 4-day weekend is completely taken up because we're going to visit family that hates me.  oh joy.  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      wow i haven't written since tuesday!  i guess i've just been sooo tired that i didn't have time.    I went to the Stars game on Wednesday vs. Edmonton.  It sucked because we lost 3-1, but the entire Coppell Hockey team was there so i spied on them most of the game after the stars were down 2-1.  It was fun, lol.  How did i find them? During the intermission i was looking for the lady that throws the nextel/ups shirts things so i could maybe catch one and then i saw TJ Drinkwater practically falling out of his seat trying to get one.  of course, he's the easiest to find because he's soo much drastically taller than everyone else, and then i quickly realized that the entire team was there.  I was in the section above them, lol.  Oh yeah, the game was crap because the ref sucked MAJOR.  I probably said ALOT of things i shouldn't have said and that probably made me look very un-ladylike.....but screw it, i was at a hockey game.  I pulled bets with the guys behind me on how bad the stars were going to lose that night and won 20 bucks.  That was awesome!  They were laughing at me the entire game for spying on the team, so i decided to use my "psychic abilties" and make them lose money lol.    In other news, Coppell plays Jesuit in what will be possibly the most important game of the season at 7pm in Valley Ranch.  This will be the final showdown between these 2 teams and will ultimately decide who will make it to section championships and who will go to state.  Jesuit's record this season is 14-7-3 while Coppell's record is 19-3-2.  Coppell currently has no players suspended while Jesuit has one, Clayton Collie, who has been suspended since March 18th.  haha, i sounded like a sportscaster just then.  I know my boys will kick ass like they always do, but i know this'll be a hard game for them and they better play well and play hard.  I expect all the jesuit people will turn out for this game as well as the coppell people!  It'll be an awesome game and you don't want to miss it!  They better show that they're regional champs and don't let anyone forget it!  Total Sleep Hours this week - 12 hrs  Today i had renaissance and i went to Local Diner again and had cheese fries, they were good.  Last night, i visited my fave graduated student in the entire world....Victor!!! He works at Kelly's and we caught up for a little bit.  He still hasn't started college and he swears that by the time i come back to visit him, he'll have started classes.  I swear, he better or i'm so going to hurt him.  Also on Wednesday, my official waiter at Boston's, Kenny, and i caught up also.  I visited with him and he's in college doing well.....i also found out he had a girlfriend! he never told me that! He asked me if i was jealous and i was like yes Kenny, i'm jealous of your girlfriend.  lol, good times.    Everyone listen to the song "Come On" by Ben Jelen........its soooooo awesome  gotta go!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

He was so hott in his interview....oh man. He played it off like "oh there was alot of emotion..." but Captain Subtext would say "yeah...i just wanted to kick his ass".  hehe, good times.  No hockey night can be followed without me saying some stupid things....lol Britty knows what i'm talking about :)  Today i went to the mall with Sarah and we partied it up.  We saw Shrek 2, it was awesome.  I bought these shoes that are plastic and see through!!!  They're SO AWESOME!!!    yay for good days!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      yes, i know, i posted 3 times yesterday.....i'm a nerd oh well.  So last night at Sarah's, we messed around watching flash videos online and talking to various people.  Then when i got home at 11, i talked to people also.  All in all, a very exciting night lol.  Is it just me or has the fact thats it summer not really sunken in yet? Am i the only one that feels like we're still in Freshman year? I mean, seriously, its like i woke up one morning for my very first day of high school, then i blinked, 2 years went by and now i'm a junior. Where'd all the time go!?!?!  alright, my muffins that i am cooking are done....  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      so i'm at sarah's house and we're talking about the legal definition of stalking...  and this one goes to Michael Buckley:  yo Michael, whats up? since you evidently read my online diary, i've decided to write a note to you!  i would like to tell you the legal definition of stalking, according to my legal counsel (lol sarah) aka Mr. Casey.  The legal definition of stalking is that it cannot occur in a public place....ex: me seeing adam havens shirtless at a sand volleyball court.  lol, he chose to be shirtless in a public place, so therefore i am not stalking him.  thank you for your time.  oh and the house thing, that event took place was with 10 other girls, yeah so we're all stalking him.....go figure.  Oh yeah and since you like to believe that i hate you, its not technically hate per se.  its more like i don't enjoy your talking about me and things you don't know much about concerning me.  Personally, i think that you should stay in your own business, but thats just me. But i don't hate you, so stop telling people that....thanks.  You're probably a nice person, but you've tainted that of what i could've thought of you by talking about things you don't know very much about. Again, thank you for your time.  partying it up with sarah now!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      LAST DAY OF SCHOOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!! so exciting.....i got an 86 on ipc and 94 on preap english, no word yet on preap world history! i predict low A on preap french and  high A/100 on BCIS  today was sad.....i'm going to miss everyone so much.....  Tampa Bay won last night 4-1, now the series is tied up! I rubbed it into Steven Danby's face today and he told me that the only reason i'm going for Tampa is because Vincent Lecavalier is hott.  I could not deny this, its true.  Hey but thats what i do after Dallas gets eliminated, find a team with the hottest guys and cheer for them all the way. its not my fault that dallas can't win lol.  ok so yesterday on the pre-game thing, they showed these black and white picture of Vinny and they interviewed him!!!  He is sooooo hott, he has really nice arm muscles and his hair is adorable.  Martin St. Louis is soooo adorable!!!  Big brown eyes and he's sooo short!!  Reminds me so much of David Ciminelli.....i swear they look like they could be related and they play with the same style also.  In other news, my dear Niko Kapanen made it onto Team Finland for the World Cup of Hockey '04.  It was very exciting! He's also playing with Jere Lehtinen and Riku Hahl, his best friend!! I can't wait until August, they're airing all the games on ESPN!!!  Blonde Kid with no fashion sense update: this is the last one kids, because now he's graduating or whatever.  He ended the year with a good note, he wore a matching outfit.  Yay for him, i wish him the best of luck with color coordination in college lol. Lauren, i think we have done our job, he finally got the message lol.  alright, i gotta go get ready to party it up with the gang at Kendra's!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      alright, first day of exams......exams were pretty easy i thought, i predict an A on English and History and a high B on IPC.  yaaay! one more half day and then i'm out of freaking school and i'm a junior!!!!  Today, after exams, i went out with Jessi to what was supposed to be a movie, but then turned into lunch with Robbie and some of his friends at La Madeleine.  I got this half rotisserie chicken thing with a mini caesar salad.....except the chicken WAS SOOO BIG!!!  I did finish it all though, i'm such a beast.  Me and Jessi then went from lunch to my house to talk about guys and life, it was very exciting.  Alright so today i was reading this conversation that i saved between me and a guy friend because it was really hilariously funny and i just came to this realization after rereading it all.  There was this one part where he was asking me why i didn't like thongs etc etc (looong story, don't ask, its kinda an inside joke) and then i was like "so what is it for you, boxers or breifs?" and then he asked this question that looked like "would you like more?" (meaning thongs) but because of his poor spelling, it wasn't saying that at all!!!  He was asking "what would i like more [on him: boxers or breifs]?" and i misunderstood the question!!!!  i'm soooooo stupid!!!  so he probably thought it was weird for me replying "sure why not?" because that was not the right answer to the question!  grrr, i'm so dumb!!!  But i dunno, i guess it worked out, because even when i asked him to clear it up to see if i read the question right, he never corrected me or restated it, so maybe that was what he was trying to ask.  Because shortly after that question, he asked me what color do i have the most of (even though he knows that i don't own much of that style of underwear because i HATE it) and then we jokes around some more.  Why i chose to put this in my blog, i have no idea, maybe because i wanted to advertise my stupidity in that conversation.  i should be studying for french, but i don't really feel like it......i will later though, i promise...  or not.  gotta go!

      yaaaaay! our last monday of school!!!!!   and i'm doing absolutely nothing in any of my classes....and it feels good  Cup Finals start tomorrow, its going to be freaking exciting!  I agree with NHL.com, Tampa Bay needs to stop relying on their goalie so much same with Calgary.  Masengill wants me to get Britty to hook us up with World Cup of Hockey tickets....although i tried to explain to him that i don't think its going to happen....  Senior Awards were today!!!  While everyone else found it boring, i found it very entertaining and borderline depressing.  I mean, a) i'm watching all my senior friends get recognized and i'm seeing my boys for one last time, b) in roughly a year, we'll all be doing the same thing!!! Oh and Jimmy got recognized for DECA, very very proud of him!!!  Cavanaugh (John, if you don't call him by his last name like i do) also got recognized for something, although i don't remember what.  haha me and Sarah are going for the "blanket award" lol!  Jessica broke up with her boyfriend today.  They went out for a month and a half and he never kissed her and barely held her hand.  So not totally right for Jess.  She broke up with him because she started liking another guy and she felt that it wasn't right to continue to go out with Kurt while she liked this other guy.  Makes perfect sense to me!  But Kurt YELLED AT HER!!?!?!  Seriously, if you saw this kid, you would be like "whoa, he has the capacity to yell at people?  really!?!".  And he was all telling Jess that people were going to hate her for breaking up with him.  um.....not really considering that alot of people such as me, Britty and Stewie were telling her to go out with this new kid anyways.  Psh, way to be mature Kurt.  Speaking of maturity, there are alot of people i've noticed lately that really REALLY need to grow up and get some balls.  Not going to say any names, but they just need to eventually and i wish them the best of luck in trying to do so.    only 4 more days.....  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      yay for good weekends, here's how it went down:  Friday Night: i saw Shrek 2 and it was the best frickin movie ever.....it was sooooo funny, everyone should see it.  Saturday: I was at Nathan's party all day and it was awesome.  I got sunburned and i went tubing.  While tubing, Nathaniel and Madison both lost their pants or almost lost their pants twice and Sarah Cacetta lost hers once.  I never lost mine and i only fell off the tube twice.  Tubing was soooo intense.  I also got sunburned and my legs are slightly (note that word, slightly!) darker now.....its very exciting!!!  Oh yes and i officially declared Nathan my man slave, that was fun.  AND i slapped Taylor Kubic because....well....i honestly don't remember, but i've wanted to do that for a long time.  Oh and Nathaniel made me give up my chair because he gave me a hard time about being "chivalrous" well him and nathan both did.  Nathan got 2 yellow shirts for his bday, lol yay for yellow shirt day.  All and all a great day because i overcame my fear of lakes AND boats.  Nathaniel, you have to stop calling me a pansy because i'm not afraid anymore.    Sunday: i went to this graduation party of this girl thats my cousin that i didn't know existed.  it was....um....interesting.  First, the girl and her family were kinda....southern, to put it lightly.  I mean they had guns in their house for crying out loud.  So i sit there, by myself, staring at the guns while various people come by me and tell me how much i've grown and i just smile and nod because i have NO FRICKIN IDEA who the hell they are.  Thank god we left after 30 mins.  then i came home, slept.....got up 30 mins later and went to play vball with ash and linds and the gang.  it was fun.  school tommorrow...... :(  gotta go!  ~~~Taylor~~~

      yaaaay i've been accepted into AcDec!!!  hurrah! but i'm changing into AP world history....noooo!  So today was unbelievably boring.  My mom has been freaking out for the past couple days, saying that i'm blowing off stuff blah blah blah....even though i have ALL A'S!!!  jeez, she drives me up the frickin wall sometimes!  She's all like "OMG you have an 89 in BCIS!!!  *gasp!* you got an 81 on a grammar test and now you've gone from a middle A to a low A!!!!"  a) she knows i suck at grammar, she's always known that and for some reason she all of the sudden feels that i should be acing that test, b) BCIS is a blow off class and therefore, i should give no effort, c) i have all freaking A's and i think she needs to get off my case!!!  She's acting like i've got all B's or i'm failing or something!!!  Alright, yeah, i have been blowing off studying for tests and crap like that for several weeks now......but i'm still getting A's and making good grades, so i say screw it.  i mean, who honestly studies for BCIS!?!  She also wants me to announce when i have a stupid test.....hmmm....no.  seriously, i can't wait until this year is over.  She also wants me to take summer classes.....yeah how about not.  I want to relax this summer, apart from my super easy babysitting job.  and i can drive, so i can do whatever the hell i want.  anyways, in other news.....Nathan's birthday was yesterday....i think thats what he told me.....i dunno, my unconscious selective chronic amnesia has kicked in and i can't remember.  But his party is tomorrow and i'm going, yay.  Nathaniel said he's going to force me to get in a boat because he knows i'm scared of boats and paranoid of them sinking.  He also knows that i don't like lakes.  Yet he's pressuring me into it by calling me a pansy....which i hate.  I can bet $5 that he'll get every other guy at the party in on it too and they'll all be forcing me into boats.  oh joy.  it'll be fun though.  So Tampa Bay lost in freaking OT to Philly.  They were a minute 30 from literally taking it all home.....but noooooooo, they have to let a goal go in from Primeau!!  And then in the last MINUTE 30 of OT, philly scores another goal!!!!  grrr, tampa shoulda had it!!!  You let me down Vinny!!!!  lol, he still looked hott. Game 7 in Tampa Bay on Saturday.......please god let tampa win!! i don't want to see Vinny and Martin cry!!  alright...time to watch Degrassi and Radio Free Roscoe (my fave Canadian Soap Operas!!)  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      school was fun today......french was unbelievably long! Mentor was cool today, we had a half-frozen cake for them that said "Congratulations Seniors 2004", it was cool.  I really got to talk to them and i never really had before, it was fun to see them one last time.  There are no juniors in my my mentor class, so us sophomores get to play Seniors for 2 years, tight isn't it?  ok so since Katie has to tell Michael Buckley EVERYTHING, she had to tell him about how we saw Adam Havens shirtless at sand volleyball or that one time at Brittnee's party that we went to his house "accidently" to make him sing happy birthday to her.  So apparently, today, Michael told Adam Havens that I, Taylor Mercer, stalk him because i went to his house (which i did that with 10 other girls!!!) and that i went to go see him at sand volleyball with Lindsay when i honestly had NO IDEA that he was going to be there.  Katie failed to mention these facts to Michael and therefore Adam thinks i stalk him.  Oh joy.  But he did ask if i was hott, lol.  Brittnee and Katie don't think that Michael really told Adam anything and that Michael made this whole freaking thing up just to scare us and me.  I don't even know Michael much less talk to him!!!!!  AAAAAGGGHHH!!!!  I hate him soooo much, he spreads rumours about people to other people and he doesn't even know what the hell he's talking about!!!!  grrr, he needs to get off my hockey team.  blah blah blah.....nothing else really happened today....  stewie - are we getting everyone together on friday night or saturday night?  we need to plan that ASAP!  AND we need to figure out who's house: yours or mine?  alright i'm going to watch my new Miracle dvd now...  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      school was fun today, alot of people signed my yearbook!!!  We (Me, Nathaniel, Katie and Lindsay) also came up with "Manual Car Dance" today at lunch.....ask me to do it for you and i will because its funny!  I also remembered Lindsay's slogan for my life story.....'So Many Hockey Players, So Little Time!: The Taylor Mercer Story'......LOL its soo true!!!  By the way, i bought Miracle today and with that dvd, i got this other cool documentary dvd on the real 1980 hockey team, its pretty cool!  I also got the Miracle soundstrack which is AWESOME!!!  Everyone needs to watch the outtakes on their Miracle dvd, they're so funny!!  Dave Silk's outtake is the best!    Today i had more things to tell my Senior buddies before they graduate like: * telling Katie that she's the funniest person i've ever met * Telling Jimmy that i absolutely love his voice and i'm going to miss him soo much! (I revealed to him yesterday that i had a crush on him this year for 2 months and he admitted that he thought i was attractive!:-D!!!!) * telling Kevin that his shoes didn't match his outfit on our date that we went on earlier in the year that kinda....died lol * telling Kevin that i'm going to miss him terribly!  Things i still need to tell my senior buddies: * Tom - that i'm going to miss him and he the funniest guy i've ever met * Cavanaugh (John) - that i love him forever and thanks for not rubbing it too bad that the stars didn't make it past the first round or the fact that we sucked this year * Josh - alright so me and him aren't tight or anything, but he needs to know that i had a crush on him last year for about a month  soooo....i'm just watching Vinny kick the ass of the Philly Flyers....haha your team sucks Britty!!!!

      wow today was fun.....except for the part where i had to go to the dentist and i swear they got my high on that nitrus laughing gas stuff!  Anyways, today i got lots of people to sign my yearbook, it was exciting!  I was "annoyed" at Nathaniel today at lunch because i had to beg him for TEN MINUTES to sign my yearbook and then he runs off and asks Lindsay if he can sign hers!!  What is that!?!  Lol, not really, i just gave him a hard time about it.  Otherwise, school was great yay.  Last night, me and Lindsay made an acronym for Adam Havens because we saw him shirtless (but i don't remember them all so bear with me): A - admirable D - desirable A - (?) M - man i want your body  H - HOTT A - almost no one is cuter V - vivacious hair (don't ask lol) E - eww you have a girlfriend N - no one beats your gorgeous smile S - smile is sooo cute!   ^haha isn't it great?!?  we should make one for every hott guy! it was so much fun!  Alright so at the dentist, i had to get these fillings and stuff and i swear they got me high on laughing gas.  I was seriously immobilized for 10 minutes, i felt like my body was 100 lbs heavier than usual.  I couldn't think straight and i was drifting in and out of what the dentist lady was telling me about my teeth, i kept on having random memories come to my head and i couldn't remember anything the lady had told me.  AND when i got up, i fell over and my head felt like it was swimming.  It was not a good feeling.    this year is almost over and it feels like it started yesterday......i feel like just a week ago i was a freshman and now all of the sudden i'm a junior!  gotta go!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      so around 4:30 today, i decide to go play sand volleyball with Lindsay, Caroline, Ashley, Julie etc etc etc.  It was fun and we got to see Adam Havens and Jimmy Meyer play volleyball without their shirts.....wow wasn't that a treat right before they graduate and never see them again.  Gary and Katie kept on teasing me everytime i missed the ball, saying very loudly that i was "distracted", which i'll admit it...i was!  Their bodies were so perfect and sculpted and omg i'll never forget that day.  They were sweaty and hot and rolling around in the sand.....oh man, best day of this year i would think.  Too bad they're graduating and i won't get to stare at them for another year.  Anyways, back to the actual volleyball part of this story.  Me and Ashley spent most of the time trying to hit the ball and then running into each other, then getting distracted by the hott guys, then falling into the sand, then making the occasional good hit, hugging and celebrating, get distracted and start the cycle all over again.  After the hott guys left though, we started playing better....but then we were all too tired to do anything and we left.  It was all and all a good time, we should do it again next weekend.    Oh yeah and when i went to Quizno's to get dinner.....the guy who works there knew exactly what i was going to order!!!  with all my extra stuff and everything!!!  it was exciting, i guess i go there too much lol!   Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      lalalalalalalla today is a boring day.....i have nothing to do.....  i finished my history project in 30 mins....it sucks, but i know i'll get a hundred anyways.    Me and Nathaniel had an interesting conversation about underwear today, it was amusing.  We both hate thong-ish underwear, yay. Our conversation ended up in me telling him for the millionth billionth time that i forgive him, oh well.  At church, me and Mary talked about her excursion to Scarborough Faire, sounded like tons of fun.  She said i should go for the hott guys....hmm this gives me ideas.    Jessi went to Flower Mound prom last night, i hope she had fun!  Robbie, you better have made it fun for her!!  This reminds me of that time when me, charlie and jessi decided that we should go "prom-ing" together....except we'd be really broke, but ya know.  Also this reminds me of my Pre-Prom pact with Jake Ross, in which if i do not get a date to prom from my grade, i take Jake to prom.  lol, we're already planning on it.  Anyways, Jessi promised me pictures tomorrow.    8 more days of hearing Matt McGary's annoying absolutely infernal noise of a voice....i dunno if me and the rest of my English class can make it.  i would like to take this time to say good bye to the people in my classes this tri, like i've done every tri:   English:  the entire class....even matt mcgary!!  i love you all, you all crack me up!!!!    IPC:   Haggerty and all the guys....you all rock my world :)  World History:  my side of the room!!!  Jen, Katie, Jacob, Cam, Matt L., Jeff (sea world LOL!), Nathan, Sean, Yoon, Ryan, Kyle, Luke, Carrie, Maxanne, Melody, Scott.....i love all you kids! see you in AP US history!!  French:  all you kids, i don't really have to say bye to because i'll see you in AP French 4!!!  I love you Ani, Amy, Audrey, Michelle, Rusty, JoBeth, Anna, Kristen, Bevon, Danielle, Kyle, Meghan, Floria, Peteria, the Lariette girl that sits next to Floria (lol sorry i never found out your name) and the girl that sits behind Ani (i never knew your name either! lol!)!!  Good times!!  Ani, remember our plan to elope and freak out your parents lol!  Amy, remember the social doughnut!!!  BCIS:  oh man, i love all you guys!!  i love you Kaler, Inci (white man's turntable! wikka wikka! lol!), Ashley, Megan, Rachna, Hayeon (one of my fave fishes, going all the way back to 2nd tri baby!), Steven, that fish kid that always stared at me (i have no idea what your name is, but you were cute!) and Mr. Allen (you crack me up!).  and a special good bye to my boys, the hockey players i started out my high school career with and the ones i've watched play for 2 years almost....all those senior hockey players that are leaving, i'm going to miss all your playing styles terribly!!  good luck in all that you do and you all better be in college hockey!  it was fun being at State twice with y'all and watching you win it for the first time!! me, brittnee, brittany, lindsay and ashley will miss you all terribly!!!  I'll miss you the most Jimmy Hunter, you're a sweet kid and a good player and i'll never forget you!  gotta go, i'm hungry!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      i ended up going to Vivace show anyways.....it was so awesome!!!  I was there with the gang and then we went and partied it up, it was fun.  The funny thing was that the sound guy didn't show up, so they were kinda having technical difficulties and Nathaniel had to do alot of it by himself.  it was still pretty good.  Nathaniel's choir was pretty awesome with their Chicago medley! After the show, Kendra and Kristen took me to Dairy Queen but before we went there we had to deal with this dog that she's dog sitting.  The dog would not go to the restroom and it kept on getting under all the porch furniture which was annoying because we couldn't really get him.  Dairy Queen was fun, except i don't really remember much of it and i don't know why.  All i know is that i had fries and Kendra and Kristen had mint chocolate ice cream.  Oh yeah at the vivace show, they had an act where these Indian girls came on and did a dance, it was soooo cool.  Taylor said it was dacing like that, that made her wish she had a culture.  I feel the same way.  Kristen said American culture is "hey lets all be sluts or something!" (i don't really remember actually, but it was pretty funny).    Ani said that me and him should elope when we're both legal just because we want to use the Drive Through Marriage Chapel in Las Vegas.  He knows that his Indian parents would totally freak out if he married a white girl, especially eloped with one, so thats why we're going to do it.  Its going to be awesome lol!  Of course, we probably won't actually go through with this unless we're on something.....haha but when me and Ani get together, you never know lol.  Darn the trash people, they woke me up this morning.  Me and Taylor Stewart decided that we should both be in Vivace because we can dance really well.....but the only problem is that we can't sing.  Maybe they'll just let us be a part of the hip hop troupe thing.  alright i'm going to go eat something and drink some caffeine......i think over the past month, my caffeine intake has slowly increased and i had worked so hard to try and get off that addiction! agh!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      so today got better than yesterday.....  me and Nathaniel got into an "argument" if you will last night because he did something to me that wasn't the greatest......but ya know what? he's still one of my best friends and i'm not going to let this one thing ruin a friendship full of memories.  Like i said, Nathaniel Zastrow, you're stuck with me forever and ever and there's nothing you can do about it lol.  so we made up today and we're cool now.....even though he won't stop apologizing and he says that he won't stop apologizing for what he did until the end of time.....i dunno how long i can take that for, lol. Jimmy was really nice about the whole thing when i was really angry/sad and i told him all about it.....he told me alot of things that made me laugh and feel better lol.    Vivace show tonight....i was supposed to go with Jessi but i decided not to.....i'm kinda tired and want to just hang out at home.  This week sucked the life out of me for now...  Tampa Bay kicked ass last night.....Vincent Lecavalier scored a goal! It was exciting. maaan he's one hot quebecois canadian! I signed him over to Brittany on certain conditions, one of which was promising not to get pregnant with his children (LOL Britty!!!).  But i get to have rights to say he's mine on every holiday except Christmas and New Years.  I kinda did owe Britt after she gave me Patrik Elias at last year's Cup Finals.  And I also got Paul Kariya last year too after he was traded to Colorado.  So she did kinda deserve Vinny.  haha, this is sad....we're handing over these players that a) are taken or b) married and c) we have absolutely no chance with, like we own them or something lol.  me and britt are crazy.  oh yeah, Brittnee told me that Jimmy Meyer and Jenna whatsherface got back together.....interesting considering that he cheated on her several times (according to various sources) with several different girls.  haha that reminds me, today in french, we gossipped about the entire hockey team....it was amusing, i'm going to miss them all so much :)  In BCIS, me and rachna made a power point about my life in 10 minutes.....thats how bored we are in that class....  OH!!  MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE WHOLE DAY!!!  Today, in Brittany's KCBY class, she got to HUG THE GREAT SAM PARNELL!!!  AAAAAAHHHHH!!!!!!!  So exciting, i wish i was in KCBY!!  AND he remembered her!!!  She said he's really grown and gotten really hott now.....woooow....maybe i need to go to TCU lol  alright, i'm hungry (shutup rachna lol)  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      haha yearbook looking was fun today!!  kcby was hilarious, i can't believe that guy said the chorus to get low straight out!!!    I'm going to miss some of the seniors sooo much!!!!  All of my boys (the seniors of the hockey team) are leaving in about a week!!!!!  Gosh i'm going to miss them!!  Me and Sarah want to hatch a plan to fail all the seniors we want to stay....but people we don't care about can go on....like the hockey players' girlfriends lol.  jk, we're not doing anything.  Anyways, this year has been quite the ride and i'm going to miss all of class of 04 and everyone thats going to TAMS!!!!  haha today at lunch, me, taylor and nathaniel saw this guy all lifting his shirt up to scratch himself or whatever and he was wearing red boxers with white snowflakes!!!!  it was so funny.  Nathaniel was all like "mercer what would you do if i did that?", i told him i would point and laugh at him.  haha not really, i wouldn't laugh that hard.  Oh yeah and nathaniel, if you're reading this, what was so funny about me not really wearing makeup next year or the year after that lol!?!?!  You give me this grin when i said i might do that and what was that all about!?!  jk, just giving you a hard time.  so yeah.....school was boring.....except for the part where i ran all the way to the auditorium with all these seniors that were also running to get my yearbook.....that wore me out because its hard to run in my skirt without it coming up!  Speaking of skirts coming up, mine almost did in front of this guy after school when i was walking outside!!!  And he noticed and he was all like "whoa that was close, haha".  omg SO EMBARASSING.  anyways....yeah  gotta go!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~  p.s- wish me luck as i do something incredibly reckless and stupid tonight....something that could possibly screw me over emotionally for the rest of my life.

      right so today was soooooo incredibly boring.....and i really needed to talk to this particular person about something but i couldn't because it was kinda in public....and then when i finally did talk to this person, i don't think i went the right way about telling this person what i needed to tell them.  so, yeah, screwed myself over in that department.  Me and Nathaniel had a bit of a fun time at lunch because i embarassed the heck out of both of us: Katie: I've almost done the splits twice today because of these shoes! Nathaniel: i don't think i've ever done the splits before... Me: Don't do it, its bad for your sex! Everyone: *looks at me in confusion* Me: omg.....GENDER!!  I meant GENDER!!!! And then everyone proceeded to laugh at me hysterically for 10 mins straight.....especially Nathaniel because of our various inside jokes lol.... We also discussed Spenser blowing out the tires to his car because he hit the curb while trying to kiss Lindsay....haha i am so telling that story to my kids.  She doesn't know where she is right now with Spenser because of that kiss....i've been there, done that...i feel your pain lindsay! During the story, Nathaniel also elbowed me because we have an inside joke about this too....except i couldn't look at him because i didn't want to burst out laughing and make lindsay think i was making fun of her when its not even about her.  haha....but Taylor told me the whole Nathaniel-doing-the-splits-hurts-his-sex thing is going to follow me for the rest of my high school career....oh joy, lol.  Tampa Bay lost last night 6-2....Vinny looked like he was about to cry, it was so cute!!! he's so hott!!!  Me and Niko are sooo on a break until next season.  Brittany and I also worked out a system as to how one of us will own Vinny.  Tampa Bay better win or i might end up sharing or losing Vinny!!!!!  aaaaahhhhh!!!  Btw, in case anyone hasn't noticed already, Martin St. Louis is like the older version of our dear David Ciminelli of Coppell!!!  Lets look at the similarities: they're both short, fast, good players, score alot of goals, have brown eyes with brown shaggy-ish hair and they're so cute!  And the beard thing that they both have at the moment makes them look alike too.  Its crazy!!!!  I swear, look at two recent pictures of them together and you will see the light  gotta go!

      yay for my 100th post!!!!  alright so here's the update since the blogger website was updating its software or whatever..  Saturday: I went to Jessi's church dance, it was fun.  Although i felt like i was being hit on by every guy there that was my age, but thats ok.  There are alot of creepy guys there, but the guys that jessi hangs out with are cool.  I got to hang out with Robbie(Jessi's boyfriend) and really talk with him and then i met his best friend, Peter, who is one cool kid. There was this one kid named Ryan who was kinda.....imposing in a sense.  He got annoying after awhile.  There was this really hott blonde guy that Robbie brought with him but he had to leave to attend to his girlfriend :/ its cool though, whatever, he was still hott.    Sunday: i hung out and did the mothers day thing.  it was alright, but my family gets annoying after 10 consecutive hours of having to hang out with them....thank god there was a hockey game on and i had an excuse not to hang out with them for 3 hours.  lalala time for school!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

Team Finland lost in OT to Team Canada......that means they have to play the bronze medal game at the World Championships *tear*  My poor Niko!!!!!!  He was supposed to win the Gold!!!!!!  oh well its cool, i still love him!!!!   I also went out to dinner with Nathaniel to talk about everything since his breakup.......we really needed to talk, it was important and all.    Tampa Bay vs. Philly tomorrow at 2pm!!!!!  PHILLY IS GOING DOWN BRITTANY!!!!!  VINNY, NIKKI AND MARTIN WILL TAKE THE FLYERS DOWN!!!!!!!!!  Everyone needs to remember this: ChArLiEsN7AnGeL: this is the moment of my life...where i officially chose Drake over Mike...for a number of reasons...1) Drake is 17...not 33 2) Drake can play the guitar 3) Drake can actually sing 4) No offense to Mike or anything...but i think Drake has more personality than Mike...5) Although Mike DOES play hockey which makes him SO much more of a man...Drake is guarnteed to not get his face ruined by flying pucks...high sticks and illegal boarding 6) and 6...Drake has his own TV show...and he's funny....there i am done...this is a HUGE turning point in my life...BUT Mike will always be my baby...and i will love him forever and ever, he's just gonna have to share me with my younger companion...that's all...as Mike gets older...i'll need someone to keep up with me...and i think Drake is a perfect match...and the first child that i have with Drake..i will name Michael Thomas Bell in honor of my first love ^Brittany has given up Mike ladies, feel free to take him.....but i would strongly advise you not to because Brittany has installed an anarchy in coppell.....and she'll murder you, but if you're brave...go for it!  Schedule for my weekend:  Saturday: 2pm to 3 - hockey game Tampa Bay vs. Philadelphia                  around 3 - project time for history with Jen, Katie and Carrie!                  8pm to 11:30pm - Tearing up the Dance floor with Jessi at her church dance!

      Team Finland update at World Championship:  WE'RE GOING TO QUARTERFINALS BABY!!!!  And we're playing Canada!!!  Nadia, we're gonna whip the ass of your Team Canada!!!  People ask me why i'm cheering for Team Finland instead of Team USA and this is my answer:  my Niko Kapanen (aka future husband) is playing for that team and the USA has no chance in this Championship.....its not like they were going to the Gold Medal round or whatever.  Oh yeah, Niko's got 2 goals and 1 assist on the sheet so far, hopefully he'll score some more!!!    Alright so i need to update for the past 4 days.....  Sunday: i studied with Sarah for the AP World History Exam.....it was superfun! not really, but we joked around alot.  She made me awesome notecards.   Monday: hmmm....i watched hockey Tuesday: STUDY PARTY AT CHUAN'S HOUSE!!!! It was fun, we got alot of studying done for the AP test.  While me and Taylor ate Oreo's and Chips and joked around, Chuan and some other people were hardcore freaking out about this test.  Around 9, all the guys went upstairs and played ping pong while me, Mary, Taylor and Stephanie tried to continue to study.  Then we got on the topic of hott seniors such as Adam Havens, TJ Drinkwater and Jordan Roach while drinking coca-cola and we started to discuss how the class of 2006 got totally gypped on hott guys.  We all agreed the the class of 2004 has the hottest guys ever.  Chuan and Sunny tried to make us get all offended by talking loudly about how the class of 2006 got gypped on hott girls.....but we told them that their statements didn't bother us because we already know we're hott.  Then we started to claim guys for our Pre-Prom-Pacts, i was going to claim Chuan as my third pact but Mary got him first last year.  So now i'm secondary pact owner, if Mary gets a date, then all rights to Chuan pass to me.  Taylor got tertiary pact.  Anyways, then we decided to teach Chuan how to dance which scared Chuan to death.  We searched madly through his house for a radio and when we found one, it was IN CHINESE!!!!  So we had to mess around with it until we figured it out.  Then we found another one and it was still IN CHINESE. But we finally got our music and we were all dancing.  The funny part is that the guys were too involved with their computer game to even care!!!  Taylor was like "You know you're a nerd when you've got 4 hott girls dancing in your room, but you'd rather play your computer game instead of watch".  It was fun fun fun.  And today was the dreaded AP World History test.  Lemme put it this way, it SUCKED.  bad.  and when i say bad, i mean really bad.  The multiple choice questions were hard and the essays.....omg, i completely BSed the last 2!  I had no idea what i was freaking talking about.  I used what little knowledge i had and then elaborated and made things up.  So yeah, i'm probably going to fail.  I know i at least got a one!! Jokes from the test: * Corbin "giving birth before the essays" * Lauren: *hugs me* it'll be ok Taylor, i'm sure you did fine.....    Me: *collapses into Lauren* Lauren, when i'm in your arms, i feel safe.....its like when i stand next to you i feel safe, hehe    Lauren: HAHAHA, its my pleasure * what the hell is this!?! * "Hold me Kendra!" * oh yeah, i got sick! * "hmm maybe if i fake a faint, they'll let me out of the test...." * Taylor Connection.......haha am i getting smarter yet? Anyways.....so it sucked but maybe if i make a good grade and they realized that i never took the class, they'll let me into college better!  yay!  alright.....Cinco de Mayo Party now!!!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      wow i completely forgot to put this little bit of information in my blog that Thursday, April 29th was...... MY NIKO KAPANEN'S 26TH BIRTHDAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!!!!!!! It was all very exciting because i had just discovered that he's playing for Team Finland in the World Championship and he had already scored a goal on that day!!!  yay for one of my most fave finns!  Alright so here's the update:  Friday: 12 HOUR NINTENDO-A-THON!!!!!!!  Me, Lindsay, Katy and Caroline (primarily) but with other people too played for 12 hrs.  Lindsay made it the full 12, i made it to about 9, and Caroline made it 8.....Katy i think made it to 10.  We played a million games of Mario Kart 64 and about half a million games of Mario Party 2.  We also played this one big game of Super Smash Brothers where i DEFEATED Spenser Samms and that game is supposed to be the game that he is the master of and i BEAT HIM!!!!  Nathaniel told him that he lost all honor because he lost to a girl.  muhahaha.  Then I played Nathaniel at Mario Kart and whipped his ass twice in a row.  He was all saying that it wouldn't happen again blah blah had he not had to leave early.  psh whatever.  it was a neck and neck game the first one and then i almost lapped him the second time.  The first game of Mario Party i won because i actually tried just like everyone else, but the next game i wasn't even paying attention too, i was just pushing buttons basically....i won it!!!  it was crazy.  I finally fell asleep at 3 or 4am....so maybe that was 9 hrs... i dunno but it was fun!  Saturday:  Lindsay drove me home and then i went right back upstairs and fell asleep.....and slept until about 2:15pm....and here i am.....and i'm probably not going to do anything else all day.  Tomorrow i go to Local Diner with Nathaniel because i need to talk to him about stuff.  It'll be tons of fun.  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      so i did the job thing today.....boring, but i made $60!  afterwards, i went over to Nadia's house and we watched Dane Bond (by the famous Broken Crayons)!  so much fun!  Then we went to Sonic in the manual car!!!  i drove everywhere in the manual car!!!  we had a few bumps to deal with when it came to stop signs and i made a really loud screeching noise in the sonic parking lot.....but we made it alive!   Last night, Brittany made me come with her to the Hockey Shop because she was scared to go by herself (we won't mention the various theories as to why, lol jk Britty!)....we had fun walking around looking at sticks.  She went there to try and get the Stanley Cup Finals 2004 on DVD for our Vincent Lecavalier party this friday....but they didn't have it!  So she's going to try and order it online.  Then we went to Chick-fil-a, where i saw my buddy Tom Pierce and i said hi to him and stuff (he's manager of the Chick-fil-a!).  We ate there and then Britt took me home.  alright, dinner time, i'm out  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      yay me and kubic finally got a chance to hang out!  last night, we went and saw Harry Potter 3.....oh man Daniel Radcliffe is a beautiful boy.  Of course, Kubic made fun of me for most of the movie by saying Emma Watson (Hermione) is really hott as well.  Then after the movie, i announced that i was hungry and he was like "here let me buy you something!"  He runs ahead to the snack bar and i told my friend Allison (who was working that night) not to sell him anything!  Allison was confused.  I guess you had to kinda be there.  Then we went to Steak and Shake and joked around/talked.  Our server, who was a senior obviously, recognized Kubic as the older Kubic's (who is a senior) little brother.  When we left, i took a wrong turn and we almost ended up on the highway and i freaked out.  Kubic helped me get off the highway and everything was ok.  Then i took him home and he's like "hey here's my house! want a tour?!".  So i went in, met his parents, saw his ping pong table (thats pretty much the only room in his house that i saw) and then i called my dad and i had to go home.  Truly delightful night.  hmmm i dunno what i'm doing today....probably watching Miracle for the millionth time but with english subtitles like Brittany did so i can understand what everyone's saying in the movie.  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      hmmm didn't do much of anything today...  so, for the millionth time, me and kubic are going to go try to see a movie....of course, as i write, we are still waiting to see if his parents are going to call him back and say that they're cool with it. we're going to try and see harry potter tonight, but i dunno if its going to happen.  i figure that if he hasn't called/IMed me by 4:45pm then i'm going to call him.  stewie pointed out that the reason he hasn't said anything yet is because he's a guy and they're not organized like that.  i forget that sometimes lol.    so if i do go to a movie tonight, then thats what i did today.  if i don't, then i stayed home and watched a movie.  NHL cba thing sucks, its not looking too good for a season next year.  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      yes! sustinence! i finished all 5 harry potter books in a week!!  thats 7 days yo!!!  last night, at 11:47pm, i finished the 5th book and i was like tearing up at the end.  Why did Sirius have to die!?!  He was like my fave character besides Ron and of course, Harry.  Because he was freaking funny!  And of course, it didn't help that Fred and George didn't have funny comments for the last 8 chapters of the book either.  grrr, oh well, maybe Sirius will somehow return from the dead in book 6, i hope so.  Anyways, i read pretty much the whole day yesterday.  My parents and dillon went birthday party for my mom's best friend's son (who is 11 mind you) and came back completely tipsy.  I'm serious.  They came home at around 2am or so and they were like really really tipsy.  According to Dillon, all the parents ended up like that.  This kid's party was a barbeque cook out swim party thing and he's only 11 and the kids are upstairs playing video games, while the parents are downstairs "dancing" to 80's music and downing alcoholic beverages.  My dad said i should be thankful i did not have to watch my mother attempt to dance.  Lets just say that i got my famous (lol everyone who has ever seen me really dance) dancing genes from my father, because my mother can't dance to save her life.  Anyways, i don't want my mom to know that i can freak dance, it would be too much for her and she'd probably have a heart attack after giving me a lecture on the morals of dancing.  Its probably a blessing in disguise that i didn't go to this party.  So while my parents were at this wild party that my dad described as "frat party" status, me and Britt stayed online late discussing Daniel Radcliffe and comparing him to various other hott guys and we also found out that his fave video game is NHL Hockey!!!!  Its a miracle in itself that he even knows what hockey is considering that he's british, unfortunatley his fave team is the Pheonix Coyotes.  oh well.  it was fun, me and britt have alot in common with this kid.  so....probably not doing anything else today either.  Sarah leaves for NY tomorrow, it'll be sad not talking to her for a whole week.   Oh yes, and yesterday morning, i watched the NHL entry draft.  I must say that the Draft Class of '04 is loads better than past years.  The boys from the Czech Republic are alot cuter this year as well as the Finns.  Holy crap but the russians were AWFUL!!!  Alexei Ovechkin (#1 player overall) is the ugliest hockey player i have ever seen enter the NHL by far.  I mean seriously.  Can i just say that i hope the kid wasn't born like that and hockey turned him that way?  He needs plastic surgery really really bad.  But of course, the cutest boy of all, my personal favorite, was Lauri Tukanen.  Yes, you guessed it, he's finnish.  He was soooo adorable!  He doesn't have the hockey hair, but its all good, we can work on that.  He was drafted by the L.A. Kings.  Yeah so his name sounds like a girl's name, who cares he's hott.  Overall, the Class of '04 had a pretty good selection of hott guys.  I definitley nominate the Czech Republic as having the best boy selection though this year and the Russians having the absolute worst selection.    i'm out!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      hallo!    Yesterday i read pretty much all day and cleaned my bookshelf.  It was slightly amusing.  Then i went over to Brittnee's house and spent the night.  We watched the movie, Love Actually, which was a really awesome movie.  There was one story in it though (because it was about 10 separate stories all connected by a single theme) about these people being stand-ins for a movie and they were naked for most of the movie....it was kinda gross.  Other than that, it was really cute.  Alan Rickman was in it too and he's the same guy who plays Professor Snape in the Harry Potter movies!!!  His character in Love Actually was a loving dad who kinda had an affair thing.....but i was laughing at it mostly because its hard to picture him any different from Snape especially when his character in Love Actually is the polar opposite from that of Harry Potter.  Colin Firth was sooooo adorable in that movie!!!  I got attached to him ever since i saw Bridget Jones' Diary.  Yeah so me and Brittnee caught up and it was cool.  I drove the Tracker there and back, it was exciting....besides the fact that i stalled 4 times on coppell road when i had to stop to wait for this person to turn on the way home....i was about to cry in that car.  And my dad's all like you need to practice more....but i'm kinda scared to tell the truth.  I don't want to stall anymore, its a scary feeling.    Today i just read some more/ate.  Nothing really exciting. I was supposed to go to this Birthday party for a family friend, but my parents told me that i was no longer required to attend about 30 mins ago. So now i'm sitting here, writing about my retarded life in this online journal thing.    ugh the tracker is frustrating.  but i still got to learn it.  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      alright a quick update.....  Wednesday: I went to see "The Terminal" with Jessi and some of her friends.  Great movie, everyone should see it.  Then after that, me and Jessi went to Quizno's where she was amazed that the people that worked there knew who i was and how i wanted my sandwich made.  lol, i told her that i literally live at Quizno's!  Then i went home, packed my bags, and went over to Stewie's house.  We made smores!!!  I discovered that Smores are very hard to eat and rather messy.....Stewie thought it was very funny that i didn't know how to eat one or really make one.  I spent the night and we (me, stewie and nadia) watched movies and "The End of the World" flash movie/Andrew Serb's movie about his failure to wrap Nathaniel's house.  Nate Blackwell was in that movie and i've known that kid since Kindergarten, he cracks me up....how did i know that he was going to be making movies about wrapping people's houses later in life lol?   Thursday: I left Stewie's house rather early in the morning, shortly after Nadia because Stewie had ballet stuff.  I did absolutely nothing on this day.  There was a really hott guy that came to my door selling coupons or something....naturally i looked terrible and had no makeup on.  Oh well, i think he was about 20 anyways.  I talked to Masengill on the phone for awhile and got caught up with him.  Turns out he played in this messageboard vs. messageboard hockey game thing for the Dallas Stars message boards or whatever....and his team won!  Now its a fad amongst other NHL team's messageboards that is sweeping across the continent.  Awesome huh!?  Then i talked to Brittany for a good long while considering that i haven't really gotten to talk to her since her work has taken over her life and her computer's internet had been temporarily jacked.  We decided that we needed Harry Potter posters because Daniel Radcliffe is really hott.  Oh yeah! I also discovered that Daniel Radcliffe is like Brittany's Male Counterpart!  Seriously.  The kid likes all the same music as Brittany and he says things just like Brittany.  Read these quotes off this website that i found him saying and if you know Brittany, you know that she would totally say something like this:  * After being cast as Harry Potter: "I think I'm a tiny bit like Harry 'cos I'd like to have an owl. Yeah, that's the tiny bit, actually." * "I don't know. People tell me I look mournful. They say, "Cheer up, Dan, it's not that bad!" Sometimes I just look into space, which freaks people out. If I was ever required to do anything other than look haunted, I could. I'm a happy person. Though I don't, like, dot my "I's" with hearts or anything - that would be too happy." * "I'm not much of a cake person." * "I was in the bath at the time, and my dad came running in and said, 'Guess who they want to play Harry Potter!?' and I started to cry. It was probably the best moment of my life." * "I'm not clumsy, I'm just accident prone." ( * On considering himself as a heartthrob: "Personally I can't see it, but if other people can, fine. Cool!"  See, i told you, Britt and Daniel Radcliffe aka Harry Potter should get married.  He's due to turn 15 in a month, so its not like she's robbing the cradle or anything.  And i know he's not a hockey player but ya know....it'll work.  lol, Britt agrees also.  So yeah, today, if me and Britt don't go get our posters, i think i'm just going to hang out inside and read.  Its all rainy today and all....perfect day to read.  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      woohoo 150 posts!!!!  celebration!  So i'll just give a quick update over the past 2 days! Monday: absolutely nothing, i finished the second and third Harry Potter books and then i watched Miracle for like the millionth time this summer....i bet i can recite that movie now  Tuesday (which is today):  First i went to work but then i went home early because the kid i babysit went to a swim party thingie.  I got halfway through the 4th Harry Potter book....looks like i'll finish all 5 before thursday at this rate!  Then Kendra called and wanted to know if i wanted to go to the mall with her and Nadia, of course i said yes! We had fun there and then we went to Nadia's house to chill.  I watched a movie that Stewie and Nadia made about y2k....they were so little and so cute!  Then we decided to make a movie about what happened after y2k if it really happened!!!  It was awesome.  Me and Nadia played ourselves in '99 (with Spice Girls playing in the background of course) and we were freaking out about our Windows 98 not working after the clock struck midnight.  Kendra was the Microsoft computer nerd telling us we were all going to die.  She also played the Chinese freaking out about y2k and calling President Clinton about it (you have to remember that this is in 1999 and he was still president).  I guess our movie was very politically incorrect lol.  So it was basically a movie where me and Nadia were trying to get Windows XP so our computer wouldn't die and the world would be saved.....Best Buy had run out (where i did my screaming and wailing about how Kendra the computer nerd needs to give me Windows XP) so we decided to break into Bill Gates' house and steal Windows XP.  We used the priceless Ask Jeeves thing (courtesy of Broken Crayons' The Potato) where we asked it "How do i hack into Bill Gates' house to get Windows XP" or something like that.  I made up the Mission Impossible theme music!  Well we didn't succeed and the world ended, it was an awesome movie.  So after Nadia took me home, i read some more Harry Potter and then Stewie/Nadia called me asking me for ideas to cure their boredom.  I decided that we should all go for a sonic run! We did, we ate and we talked.  It was alot of fun! I almost went over to Stewie's house for the night, but my dad said i couldn't because he didn't want to pick me up at 8am (stewie had ballet).  So we made plans for tomorrow night instead!  it'll be tons of fun i'm sure.    Jessi- i got your messages!!!  i know, i haven't seen you all summer and i miss you sooooooo much!!! Where the heck did you go!?!!  anyways, we have to hang out soon!  alright, and i'm up to read some more and then sleep or something like that.  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      HARRY POTTER 3 IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!!! (saw it on Friday night with Britty) Daniel Radcliffe aka Harry Potter is so hott now!!!  I know i still kinda feel like i'm robbing the cradle because he only about to turn 15, but thats ok, he's got the most beautiful raven black hair i've ever seen.  And his eyes are bautiful, i hope they're not contacts.  Everyone knows as well as i do that i usually go for blondes, but this kid is one of the few exceptions.  Sorry Kubic that we didn't get to go see it together, but i'll gladly go see it with you again!  Alright so Saturday, i had this family dinner but Ash, Gary, Julie and Kubic all saved me by asking me to come over with them to Gary's house and watching a movie.  It was fun, even though we didn't actually watch a movie.  After finishing the movie at Gary's house, we went over to Ash's house and played volleyball.  Me, Kubic and Gary attempted at soccer, but it didn't work out because a) i'm used to playing a goalie in hockey (lol Nadia and Kendra, my fellow 2004 Varsity PE hockey champions!) and b)we didn't exactly have an official goal and we didn't know where we were supposed to kick the ball.  Plus, Kubic is alot bigger than i am, so he probably could've taken me if he hadn't been scared that he was going to lose to me lol.  We got eaten alive by mosquitoes and then we went home.  Kubic said he might take of work Thursday so we can finally hang out because we never get to.  Then me, Ash, Gary and Julie went up to Steak and Shake to visit Lindsay.  Of course, i called my dad at 10:05 and he's like "you have to be home at 10:30", so i made Gary eat really super fast so i could get home in time after taking him home.  Then when i get home, it turns out that my parents didn't care!  What!?!?  Oh well.  Oh yes, i have decided, that in my extreme boredom, i am going to try to read all FIVE Harry Potter books in a week.  I started this on Saturday so i have until this Saturday to finish.  I already finished the first book on Saturday and i started the second book today.  Anybody want to make any bets on if i can do it?   Today, i didn't do much of anything.  I haven't slept in 2 days and i don't know why.  Sarah thinks it might be because i've got things on my mind or i'm stressed about something.....but if i've got things on my mind, why don't i know what they are!?!  I guess i should think about stuff.....one of today's events will have me thinking i'm sure.    hmm, i think i'm going to go back to reading!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      aaah everything's so confusing!!!  alright so i made plans with Britty and Jess kinda earlier in the week but then Kendra wants me to come to her "Tommy Boy" party, but i tell her i kinda have other plans.  Well then i thought those plans kinda got diminished because Jess couldn't make it and Britt was having problems with her car brakes or whatever....so then i was going to go to Kendra's party BUT then i called my mom and she's like "no you have to babysit dillon" and i'm like agh way to tell me in advance!!!!  So i tell Kendra i can't make it and i'm really sorry.  Then Britty IMs me and is like hey we're still on with plans, i just can't spend the night like the original plan!  Then my mom is like fine whatever, you don't have to babysit.  and i still can't make it to Kenny's party and i feel really bad.  I'm really sorry everyone!!!!!!    Kubic, we can't ice skate/see a movie saturday because i have fathers day plans....sorry!  aagh way to many things to think about!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      yesterday i did absolutely nothing until me and sarah both discovered we were doing nothing and planned something.  We got about half the gang together and we attacked Quizno's.  I acquired the title of Dine-Out Queen from Sarah because almost every restaurant i go to, i have an official waiter or someone who knows what i get everytime lol.  For example, the Quizno's guy (i don't know his name lol!) knows what i get the Beef and Cheddar sandwich, extra cheese, mustard only, no tomato or mayonaise, lettuce and spices; Kenny knows that i get a coke with an individual sized pepperoni pizza (he's been my waiter since he started his job at Boston's, a whole year now!); Victor knows i get a coke with cheese fries (but thats partially because we were in a class together my freshman year).  lol i know, i'm retarded.  Anyways, so we ate there and were stupid for awhile and then we decided to go to the dollar movie theatre.  We saw Ella Enchanted, oh man the Prince Char guy is sooo cute!!!  Other than that, the movie was pretty good, our group were like the only people laughing....it was amusing.  Then we dropped Sarah off and we went back to the quiznos parking lot so i could get my car, but before we all left we sat in Kendra's car, drinking Peach Fitness water and chatted about our love lives.  Kendra found it the perfect time to make fun of how i go for blonde finnish hockey players with longish blonde hair, lol!  Shawn was describing her cousin and Kendra's like "oh is he finnish?  does he play hockey?  does he have longish blonde hair?  if so, mercer will love him!", i was just like shutup kenny.  hehe anyways fun stuff.  already, just like last year, i am starting to feel the emptiness that is the lack of hockey in my life.  I hate summer!  well actually, i like summer just minus the no-hockey part.  Why can't they have a summer hockey season just like they have a fall baseball thing!?  i'm out!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      hmm today is thursday right?  oh how i wish there were some coppell hockey game to go to tonight.  i am SO FREAKING BORED at this moment in time.  Britt is still at her babysitting job and Jess is out hanging with Jordan and his posse or something before Jordan leaves to go wakeboarding or something like that.  I think i will go out in the manual car later and do something.  i dunno, it depends if i actually want to move from the computer.  I read up on the CBA thingie for the NHL and their economic/political problems......in my opinion we're screwed and we're probably not going to get a season next year because the little superstar hockey players like Mike Modano and Sergei Fedorov don't want to give up some of their precious money in order to save the game they love most.  Same with owners of the clubs too, they don't want to fork over some money either.  I learned this off of Step by Step today at my babysitting job, that the fans are the ones who make up the sport and without us there would be no NHL.  From what i read, if both sides would just make salary cuts and make sacrifices (but namely if the players would just make financial sacrifices such as shaving off a few million dollars from their salaries and paychecks) then we wouldn't be having this problem.  I dunno, i just pray that this season wasn't the last.  alright well, i'm out because i have nothing more to say.  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      alright so today, i found out that i have to start paying for my own insurance.  it sucks.  i might have to get a second job to help pay for it.  oh well, i guess the real world has come to find me and now i've got to really start paying for stuff.  job was boring today and i slept through it.  the kid i babysit also gave me ice cream. yummy.  i went to go visit Taylor Kubic today at his new job at the Tom Thumb on Beltline and MacArthur just like he asked.  He said it gets really boring up there, so since i was on that side of town today, i decided to say hi.  I went in there once and looked through every aisle because he said that he stocked shelves etc, but i couldn't find him.  So i looked at Father's Day cards and bought a pack of gum so i wouldn't look retarded.  Then i went to the hair salon nearby and bought my dad this awesome smelling shampoo stuff....i think its the brand he really likes.  Then i decided to go back to the Tom Thumb and just ask where Kubic was.  So i go to the Customer Service and ask if he's working today, this random guy nearby that i assume works there was like "Yeah, he's upstairs, i can go get him to come down for a minute".  oh man then i felt reeeeeeeally stupid.  Now i look like i'm Kubic's a) girlfriend or b) stalker.  Not what i wanted at all.  I thought about running away, but then i thought that might be kinda mean.  So i waited and read the back of a Motrin box.  Then Kubic came down and he was like "Mercer! what are you doing here!?"  I was like "ummmm.....i told you i'd come visit you?"  He couldn't really talk because he was in training at that moment and i had no idea.  oops.  So then i was like well let me know about if we're going to do something wednesday night and he's like ok i'll ask my mom if i can drive tomorrow night blah blah blah.  i can't believe he asks me to do something but then he hasn't even really planned it or told his parents yet....oh well, typical guy i guess lol.  So then i left Tom Thumb feeling really stupid and embarassed that i called Kubic out of his training (that i had no idea about) just to be like "hey whats up".  grrr, oh well.  Alright about this wednesday night thing.  I was talking to Kubic the other day and i was like "you know what? we're friends but we never hang out together outside of parties of mutual friends that we're invited to" and he was like "I know, its sad, we should hang out sometime this week".  First we decide to go ice skating but then we went to the movie idea.  So this will be the first time outside of the cotillion days, school and mutual parties that he and I will have hung out.  crazy huh?  wow i am soooooo bored, i wish someone had a survey in their blog that i could steal so i would have something to do  dinner time!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      so yesterday, me and Nadia went to the 86:12 concert and then we crashed their party!!!  Mrs. DeLoach said we could!!!!  It was fun, Jake taught me what "snuggle time" was according to the people who went on the mission trip.  I think i'm liking that lol.  Everyone in the whole hot tub decided to have mission trip snuggle time.....i don't think i've ever been that close to people i don't know in my entire life.  The last time i hugged someone i didn't know was when Coppell won State freshman year.  Oh man did Jordan Roach look hot!!!!  He's really really sculpted because he plays soccer i suppose.  I got to talk to him and tell him that i hoped to see him at the World Cup someday, he didn't think he was that good...psh whatever.    Song of the Day: "Penny and Me" by Hanson (yes, the girly boys are back.....but they've grown up, become more masculine and really hott....especially the one named Taylor!)

We play them again next Sunday and then we move on to the 2nd stage of qualifying rounds.  European qualifying rounds don't start until August 18th and i dunno if they're even going to be on our tv and i can't watch them if the  World Cup of Hockey is on at the same time! aaah so many games to watch and such short time!!  all my 86:12 kids are back from their retreat.....you kids rest up, i don't need you all getting sick!!  we still have the rest of the summer before camp to party!!!  Haley - have fun in Gulf Shores!!!!   Tell me how the waves are since i won't be there this year....first time we won't be chillin together at camp *tear*!!!  Sarah wants me to go to her choir show tonight.....but i dunno if i can make it! i'll try though!  and the babysitting wasn't that bad, but i have decided that i don't want kids for a looong time lol.  i made $40!!  alright i'm out!

      so last night, me and Jess were going to do something, but then she had to cancel because her parents said no. So i called Nadia and we decided to go party.  On our way to chili's, i blew right through a stop sign because i was pointing out Mormons on bikes on the corner to Nadia because i don't think i've ever seen mormons on bikes before.  Nadia even told me about the stop sign before we got there.  We went to Chili's and ate, then we went to Grapevine Mills to walk around.  It took us 10 mins to find a parking space!!!!!!  Also, on our way to Grapevine Mills, this bastard of a guy who obviously has a coroporate job, almost ran me off the freaking bridge!!!  I was changing lanes and i looked behind me and signaled etc etc and at the moment that guy was way behind me.  Well, he decided to change lanes right when i was changing lanes and he also decided to speed up like crazy!!!  So he's all honking at me like i did something wrong when i didn't!!!  I'm like what the hell get off the frickin road if you don't know how to frickin drive!  Sorry, my road rage lol.  So after we got to the mall, we walked around for an hour and didn't buy anything.  I think we just had fun driving around coppell.  So then we decided to go to Sonic for Cherry Limeades.  On our way there, we stopped at stop lights and had "dance breaks".  We were jamming to 90's dance music!!!  So we're in the car dancing the time away and this lady 2 lanes down was laughing at us and she gave us the thumbs up.  It was awesome.  So we went to Sonic, got our drinks and sat there for awhile.  Then the song, "Move Bitch, Get out the way" by Ludacris came on and we decided that was the theme song for my dad's land rover.  Then i took Nadia home and i went to sleep.  Today is....BRITTANY'S 16TH BIRTHDAY!!!!!!!!!!!  SO WISH HER HAPPY BIRTHDAY IF YOU GET THE CHANCE!!!!!!!!!  today, my Aunt Patty decided to dump her 3 adorable yet oftentimes annoying kids on me tonight, so i can't go do anything.  I can't even celebrate Britt's bday by running over and hugging her to death!!!  Its ok, at least my uncle will pay me.  I hate this though, she does this all the time to me because she knows my mom won't let me say no because she's a family member.  Lets see....i'll be watching them from about 5 to 10/11 because of my uncle's 20 year reunion....3 kids under the age of 10....thats about $6.50 an hour....so roughly 36-40 dollars tonight.  Awesome!  oh yeah, if you haven't seen harry potter 3 or you don't mind seeing it again, lemme know because i haven't seen it yet!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      alright finally, the blogger thingie is working with me and its letting me login, here's the update:  Wednesday: more partying about the Cup, i watched the parade on CNN at the babysitting job, Brad Richards looked really hott.  I came home, took another shower and got ready to go on the hunt for a Vincent Lecavalier stick for Britty's birthday.  So i go on the hunt and discover that the Vinny stick that i originally saw was on clearance and is now gone.  The people at Oshman's were absolutely no help because they don't know anything about hockey.  So then i went to The Hockey Shop and discover that Vinny's new stick, a replica of the one he used in the playoffs, a Vector something (i can't remember the numbers after Vector but its the best of the best stick on the market right now) was $150!!!!!!!!!  I don't have that kinda money so i decided to buy Britt a Vincent Lecavalier poster.  Later, Nadia came over and we partied it up/talked about stuff, it was awesome.    Thursday: Job, got paid $60 for this week yay.  I went back to The Hockey Shop, discovered that they couldn't order me a Vinny poster so i decided that i'd buy Britty something SO MUCH COOLER!!!  Its this thing where it lists all the division of the NHL and has a bracket for playoffs and you can track the teams throughout the season/playoffs with the little magnets with the team emblem on it!!!!  its so cool, i want one!!  So after i watched the NHL Awards 2004 (instead of the 2004 MTV movie awards), i drove over to Britty house at 9:30pm to give her my present.  She loved it along with the Tampa Bay stickers that i got her for her car/bedroom door.  We hung it up and figured out (without using the computer!) who all made it to playoffs and who beat who to be in which part of the bracket.  it only took us 10 mins!!!  So that was cool.  I heard the MTV movie awards were kinda stupid this year, so i dunno if i'm going to watch the encore.  Now its friday and i think me and Jess are going to do something as soon as she finished her chores since everyone is either working or on vacation/at a summer camp thing.  Me and Jess decided that we're not going to make the same mistake we made over Christmas Break when no one was home and we both thought the other was busy and didn't call so we were both at home, really bored and alone lol.  gotta go!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      the Cup Finals party at Britty's house was freaking awesome!!!!!  The decorations she made/bought for Tampa Bay were so awesome!!!  TAMPA BAY WON THE CUP BABY 2-1!!!!!!!!! Nat totally called the winner and the score.  Intense game, reminded me of State in Freshman year where me and Brittnee were having nervous breakdowns during the game.  Vinny and Marty looked adorable as usual and Nikki gave a stellar goaltending performance.  It was so nice that they weren't just another Cinderella story, this was their first time ever to get past the first round of playoffs and they went all the way to win the cup.  Dave Andreychuk finally got his Cup.  Alright so after we watched most of the celebration, we went in Nat's car to run around and scream at cars that Tampa had won.  If we screamed at your car, i'm sorry lol.  We came into contact with these middle schoolers and they were all chasing the car with their bikes and Barney was yelling "fuck you" at them....that was amusing.  Then we painted our cars with Tampa Bay stuff in celebration and we decided to have a celebration sleepover.  Jess' parents freaked out and wouldn't let her spend the night, but we still had fun even though we missed her!  We went for a candy run at like midnight and went off roading in the parking lot of middle school north.  Then we swam, stayed up until 3am and played Truth or Dare with Barney.  Oh yeah and did i mention that Barney ate like half my cake by himself....yeah he did lol  So after my wild Cup Finals night, i went to babysitting and slept while the kid played video games.  It was fun.  I get to come in late this whole week, its exciting.  alright so i think i'm going to go sleep/watch tv....i'm so tired  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

Its going to be a 20 minute brownie cake and its going to be yummy.  I'm going to hunt around for blue icing and write "go lightning!" on it. Go Lightning!!! Win the Cup and save us from Canadian/Iginla-ization!!!!  gosh i miss soooooo many people now that the summer has started....there are some people i don't get to talk to anymore and it makes me sad!!!  alright....stop, its cake making time! (hehe nadia)  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      oh man, today was the best day ever!!!!!  So me, Britty, Jess and Britty's cousin went to six flags and it was soooo much fun!  I rode the Titan for the first time ever and it was sooo intense!  i was sooo scared because it was so frickin high....i went into hysterics halfway through the ride and grabbed onto Barney/Daniel's (britty's cousin) arm and wouldn't let go.  he was like "aah let go!" and i was like "aah i can't!!!".  lol.  Thanks again britty for taking me!!!  Then afterwards, we swam in Britty's pool and played pool basketball.  I guess i took on the role of defense subconsciously because i was rushing after the ball and fighting Barney for it.  In fact, he did a few flips while i was holding onto him trying to get the ball.  Totally intense.  Of course, our team of 3 totally beat Barney's one man team down.  Then we had a war for this raft float thing.  I took Barney down 3 or 4 times using my body weight and Britty and Jess also took him down quite a few times!!!  Of course, we won the raft and Barney wouldn't admit that we won the raft or basketball...psh such a guy lol.  Jess had to leave early and i chilled at Britty's house for a few hours either watching her make signs for our wicked awesome Tampa Bay Cup Finals party or watching Degrassi with Barney.  Her signs for the party are sooooo awesome!!!  And she's going to try and get balloons and streamers etc etc!!!  Its going to be tight.  I still can hardly believe that we pulled a Game 7.....Martin St. Louis is a god.    Tomorrow....our fair hockey season ends and the stupid NHL politics take over, possibly deciding whether our 04-05 season will happen or not.....please pray that we get a season and that Tampa Bay will win the Cup.   Oh yeah! and David Ciminelli is coming back to play for our 04-05 Coppell Cowboys!!!  yaaay!  alright i gotta go....i'm soo freaking tired!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      so this morning, i took the real SAT....and i just want to let everyone know that i think its a hell of alot easier than the frickin PSAT.  Seriously, the math was easy as well as the reading parts.  SATs make me hungry, my stomach was eating itself during it!!!    I also got my TAKS grades and report card today.  The frickin TAKS people gave me a 2 on my essay!?!?!?!  what the hell it was sooo not a 2!!!  Then again, i was just writing crap down, so i guess its what i get.  I got "Commended Performance" or whatever on Social Studies and Science...so i guess thats pretty cool! I think i should get scholarships for that or something.  Social Studies, i got all the questions right and on the Science TAKS, i got 50/55.  English TAKS, i was above average but not commended because i got 52/57 plus writing grade.  Math TAKS, i was the tiniest bit away from commended performance (surprisingly) and i got 43/56 on that....i think their grading is messed up.  I suppose i can expect to do pretty well on those TAKS tests my junior year!  No remedial for Mercer!!!!!!  Anyways, Report card stuff now.  I GOT ALL FREAKING A'S!!!!!!  After i finish this entry, i'm going to go calculate my GPA for the tri and average it with all my other GPA things from this year!  So i get Gold Renaissance AGAIN.  Thats twice in a row, its exciting.  You know, i like this A's thing, i think i'm going to try and acheive those more often.  All A's on my exams too except for IPC (86, thanks to gay Mr. Fleming).  Totally awesomeness.  Now all i need is my AP World History grade (which you all know that i didn't take the class for) and my SAT score, hopefully they're good grades :/  Oh man, Game 6 of Cup Finals tonight.....scary man.  I'm sitting on the edge of my seat and we still got 4 hrs until the game starts!  Let me give you the run down if you haven't been keeping up: Game 1: Flames win 4-1 Game 2: Lightning win 4-1 Game 3: Flames win 3-0 Game 4: Lightning win 1-0 Game 5: Flames win 3-2 in OT (as called by Barney, Britty's cousin, in which Britty lost a dollar in the bet they made) Game 6: game in Calgary, Tampa must win if they have any hopes of winning the cup Game 7: back in Tampa, we pray that we get a Game 7  so basically, if Tampa doesn't win tonight, it sucks because that means Vinny and Marty get no cup and i know from observation that if they don't win it, they're seriously going to cry.  And me and Britty will cry too just because we've gotten attached to these boys since Dallas got eliminated.  Pray that they pull a game 7 and this isn't just another Cinderella story.  i think me, britty and jess are getting together to watch the game tonight, but i dunno.  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      guess what!?!  i'm writing from my own comp because....   MY INTERNET LIVES!!!!!!!!!!!   so now that the comcast people have fixed it, i can go back to my normal everyday life.  yay.  harry potter comes out today and i want to go see it really REALLY badly.  i dunno if thats going to happen now....but i have a car so its all cool!  yeah, thats right, i have a car! its actually my parents, but i use it more than they do.  Its a manual car that i learned how to drive, an 80-something tracker.  Its red and old.  Very nostalgic.  I want to name it, but i have no idea. Kubic thinks i should name it Niko, but its too much of a hard core awesome car to name it Niko.  So i gotta find a different name fast.  gotta go!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      alright so i'm at Britt's house updating this parceque mon internet is broken because the comcast people are gay.  aaaaahhhh!!!  i'm going to die!  not really, i'm just really bored now.  so Tampa Bay lost in OT to Calgary....and it sucked because we soooo dominated the 3rd period and OT!!!  Vinny kinda forgot how to play hockey sometimes and screwed up some scoring opportunities....but thats ok we still love him! Now we have to complete this win/lose alterated series thing and win in Calgary for Game 6 in order to pull a Game 7.  Pray for the Lightning, i'm too scared to give a prediction.  :/  job is boring, but i got paid $75 this week.  Oh yeah so at the hockey party with Jess and Britt, i met Britt's canadian cousin. He's really hott and really funny.  He's one cool kid.  Except he doesn't watch/like hockey!!!!  *gasp!* thats the only weird part. he and i make fun of each other's accents, lol, its tons of fun.  pray that when i get home today, my internet is working :)  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      woohoo! Lightning won last night 1-0 and now the series is tied up at 2-2!!!  I can't believe we pulled that off, it was a miracle of god.  and the stupid finn, Ville Nieminen, boarded our dear Vincent Lecavalier and now he has a gash in his beatiful head. *tear* Now his hair will be messed up!!!  So Ville Nieminen is officially on Brittany and I's hitlists. On my hitlist, i made him second to Todd Marchant, the guy who hit Niko really hard last season.  He's probably top on Britt's hitlist.  There are several things that are evil in life and here are the top 3: a) manual cars, b) ovens and c) Ville Nieminen/Jarome Iginla.  alright so anyways, Lightning won and the next game is on Thursday on ABC at 7pm. Emily seems to think that the Flames are going to win....psh whatever! Speaking of the Flames, my brother said the funniest thing yesterday about them!!  Here's how it went down:   *me and Dillon are watching the game*   Dillon:  which team do we want to win?  Me:  Tampa Bay, the ones in blue and white  Dillon:  oh....are we playing the Soviets!?!  Me:   *laughs hysterically*  Dillon, that was in the movie Miracle, the Soviet Union doesn't exist anymore...  Dillon:  But the other team's jerseys are red and have big C's on them!!!  Doesn't that mean that they're communist?  They look like they're the soviets!  Me:   *laughs even harder*  The Soviet Union fell at least 15 years ago, it doesn't exist! Thats why we have all those annoying little countries with their hard-to-pronounce capitals to remember! The team in the red is the Calgary Flames and they're from Canada....and they're not communist!  Dillon:  well they look communist..... *walks away*  ^ man i love Dillon, he cracks me up  so anyways, family came over....but i didn't really talk to them, i was watching the game.  We ate hamburgers for memorial day and stuff like that.  Ro wanted me to come hang out, but i couldn't because my mom wanted me to hang out at home with family....even though i didn't really talk to them.  way to go mom.  gotta go.....oh wait....and do nothing.  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      alright, i'm going to attempt to remember what i've done for the past couple days.....  Monday - First Day of AcDec camp and Mary's party!&nbsp; Mary's birthday party was awesome!&nbsp; Michael Buckley and I resolved our differences, lol, it turns out that he didn't really tell Adam Havens that i was stalking him but rather that he had a whole bunch of girls that think he's hott and came to his house at a birthday party and when Adam asked Michael if any of them were cute, my name was the first that popped into Buckley's head to tell him.&nbsp; So its not all bad right?&nbsp; Buckley said that i shouldn't even bother coming to the hockey games this year for Coppell because we lost like half our team.&nbsp; I dunno, i think i'll still go if school doesn't conflict.&nbsp; yeah so then afterwards, i went to Nadia's house to check out her camp pictures and then i ended up spending the night.&nbsp; We watched "Spice World", just so we could relive our childhoods.&nbsp; That movie was sooo funny and retarded at the same time, i think i'm going to ask for it for christmas just so i can have it.&nbsp; We also watched our usual show, Forensic Files.&nbsp; We crashed around 1am because i was sooo tired.  Tuesday: Second day of AcDec camp!&nbsp; It was hilarious because when we were playing this game thingie on introducing people, Sirisha introduced Kristen Berry as "This is Kristen Berry, she likes to get married and have lots of kids".&nbsp; LOL!!&nbsp; And of course everyone gave me a hard time because they  claim  i look like Lindsay Lohan, Sitara didn't help.&nbsp; I gave Sitara a hard time because she didn't know that Wayne Gretzky, the Great One and the Messiah of Hockey, was a hockey player.&nbsp; Then me, sarah and steph went to the dollar movie theatre for 50 cent Tuesday and saw "Mean Girls".&nbsp; That movie was pretty racy (sp?) for a pre-teen movie!!!&nbsp; I mean every other word is "bitch", "slut" or "whore"!&nbsp; I mean i still liked it and thought it was funny, but holy crap!&nbsp; Oh yeah and they're all talking about being half-virgins and virgins and non-virgins or dykes or whatever!&nbsp; i'm looking around me and pretty much everyone in there is either an adult or around the ages of 7-12!!!&nbsp; So i dunno, maybe that movie was more meant for high school kids not middle school kinda like it was advertised.&nbsp; I then came home and my Coupling Season 3 dvd and my new Dashboard Confessional cd came in, so i watched/listened to them for the rest of the day.&nbsp; oh yeah and Connor (the guy from the wedding) called and we're going to do something eventually....he said maybe on wednesday.  Today!:&nbsp; Last Day of AcDec camp!&nbsp; After our workshop thing, alot of us went to 7 Salsas and cracked each other up.&nbsp; We had a dance party in the bathroom to Latino music, it was awesome.&nbsp; Connor and I are supposed to go do something this afternoon/tonight but who knows, he's supposed to call me.  I have work Thursday and Friday and on friday i will have money!!!&nbsp; So that means i get gasoline for danny (the el car-o!)!!!!  Oh yes and just to spread the word:&nbsp; everyone remember that bitch of a freshman that accused masengill of indencency with a child?&nbsp; well, she's at it again because apparently there is this 2 year period in which she can refile the charges after masengill is let off.&nbsp; Why we have this in our judicial system, i have no idea, but its there and she refiled.&nbsp; Jess and I have a theory about why she's doing this: 1) if she didn't refile the charges, she has the possibility of being charged with purgery (i think thats what its called, but in other words, she's charged for lying) and 2) she's refiling in the summer so there's a small chance that anyone will really find out about it and he can't get as much support, not to mention the fact that all the seniors are leaving pretty much as of next week and they were our biggest supporters.&nbsp; Of course, this is our own speculation.&nbsp; There is also rumour going around that she really did make it all up and she told someone.&nbsp; If you were a witness to her saying that or you've heard that from someone else that's friends with her, please tell me.&nbsp; His trial before the Grand Jury is August 3rd, and i'm going to get more info on how we can help him.&nbsp; There is also rumour of a rally at an unnamed location, but no idea if thats actually going to happen.&nbsp; Please write more letters if possible, if you have the address, if not, email me at  urlLink merc_o@lycos.com  and i'll get it to you.

      oh man, the wedding i went to last night was SO AWESOME!!!!   Here's the story: i got a little taste of prom day early as i had to get my hair all done pretty and get a manicure and pedicure.&nbsp; the asian ladies at the salon were hilarious.&nbsp; they thought i was awesome because i love asian stuff too!&nbsp; anyways, alright Vivian looked beautiful and glowing of course and Brad was really funny as always.&nbsp; The wedding was beautiful as was the church and it was a short service thing.&nbsp; So when everyone was clearing out to send the bride and groom onto reception (in a party bus!)&nbsp;with bubbles and all, i saw this really cute guy who had longish light brown hair and green eyes.&nbsp; I decided that he would be the one i would pick up tonight.&nbsp; Haha, well that didn't happen because of something else.&nbsp; We go to the wedding and we ate blah blah blah.....and then they started playing "Hey Ya" and i decided to go dance.&nbsp; I met this guy named Connor, a guy who had just graduated from high school and was going to SMU.&nbsp; He lives in Coppell but he went to Cistercian high school.&nbsp; Anyways, we danced and hung out the entire night with some other people like Emily, Brad's sister, and Scott, this kid from Jesuit.&nbsp; So i gave him my phone numbers and he said he'd call me ASAP so we could hang out.&nbsp; He's sooo nice.&nbsp; He got my drinks and everything!&nbsp; And get this, this is the weirdest part of the night!&nbsp; I went out there for the bouquet toss and caught the bouquet!!!&nbsp; But then Connor went out there for the garter toss and he CAUGHT the garter!!!!&nbsp; Haha, after that both our parents were acting like we were both getting married.&nbsp; So that was pretty cool.&nbsp; And because it was a wedding, my parents let me drink alcoholic beverages that night.&nbsp; I had 2 wine spritzers, 1 and 1/2 bottles of Corona with lime (Connor got me those), 1 glass of champagne, half a glass of wine and half a bottle of bud light.&nbsp; Oh yes and a few sips of Vodka-tonic.&nbsp; That definitley surpasses my last alcohol count lol.&nbsp; I was a little off balance, but so were my parents so it was ok.&nbsp; Anyways, i wasn't nearly as wasted or even close to it as some of the other people at that wedding.&nbsp; Brad, the groom, was stone drunk and Vivian was tipsy.&nbsp; And this one guy was so drunk, he went up on stage and sang "I Believe I Can Fly" at the top of his lungs lol.&nbsp; That was the funniest thing i had seen in a long time.&nbsp; Then this other guy went up there and tried to make a speech, but i dunno what he was saying, he was too drunk.&nbsp; The bridesmaids were all drunk too, including Amanda and Brad's sister who is 15, Emily.&nbsp; I would just like to say that i drank pretty responsibly unlike other people.&nbsp; So pretty much everyone at reception was drunk except the flower girl and ring boy.&nbsp; It was very amusing though.&nbsp; So anyways, to get more to the point, i made the hook-up at my friend's wedding, in Carol's words, so i guess thats good.&nbsp;   This morning i went to church and told everyone what happened at the wedding and Carol was so excited that she kissed me on both cheeks and told me that i could borrow her clothes etc etc and everyone said i had to give the whole story after the date.&nbsp; Then after church, we went to celebrate my brother, Garik's, birthday.   And here we are.   There's a Camp Memories party tonight that i'm going to, that should be fun.   Love,  ~~~Taylor~~~

      woohoo sarah's party was awesome!!!&nbsp; the after party was even better!!! lol i broke curfew laws because the after party went so long.&nbsp; it was sooo rebellious.&nbsp; anyways, so it was funny.&nbsp; we jammed to the classic songs of the 90's like "Baby got back" and Spice Girls songs and Destiny's Child songs lol.&nbsp; so awesome.&nbsp; me, nadia and mary still knew every word!&nbsp; this reminds me, i didn't get to talk to chuan at all at that party!&nbsp; i think i'll run over to his house today and say hi because i never got to talk to him after he gave me that hug and we knocked over the glass cup!&nbsp; anyways, matt miller is sooo funny!&nbsp; so is david day.&nbsp; they were members of the after party as well.&nbsp; i hoped sarah liked my international birthday basket with the NUTELLA!!!!&nbsp; we popped that can open and i ate some toast with it....mmmmm.&nbsp;  &nbsp; alright so when i got home, i discovered that my screwed over knees from being broomball goalie.....got even more swollen after jake ross flipped me over his back as i tried to prove to him that me and my mighty 100lbs body could take him down.....which evidently didn't work.&nbsp; I had to take 3 motrin and ice down my knee for awhile.&nbsp; i'm really hoping that these swelling knees and bruises, as wicked awesome as they are, will go away before my friend's wedding.&nbsp; i dunno if Vivian's hott cousins will go for the banged up knees with a pretty dress look. &nbsp; so i tried to sign up for scholarships today.....didn't work &nbsp; monday, i leave for church camp with the gang!&nbsp; woop woop!&nbsp; its going to be exciting, i'm sure.&nbsp; so hopefully i get to hang out with jessica and brittany (maybe, she might be gone aaaall day to six flags with some of her barn friends) on sunday because they're both leaving on thursday while i'm gone and i won't get to see them for a whole week and a half or more!!!&nbsp; Jessica is leaving for Oklahoma to visit some friends and Brittany is off to Canada.&nbsp; Britt - if you buy me some canadian candy, i swear i'll pay you back :)&nbsp;  &nbsp; alright, i haven't slept well in 4 days for some reason....lets see if the running total increases to 5 tonight!&nbsp; cheers &nbsp; Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

       alright i forgot to write some things in yesterday's entry......    &nbsp;  did i mention that on tuesday with Lauren, we saw this REALLY SCARY looking movie preview!?!&nbsp; Alright maybe its not that scary, but it looked very creepy blair witch-esque.&nbsp; Its this movie called "Open Water" and apparently its about these 2 divers/snorkelers people that were left behind in the middle of the ocean by their boat.&nbsp; And you get to watch from their point of view what happens to them with sharks and a bunch of other crap.&nbsp; There was this one part where you're watching the girl in the movie have a mental breakdown and then all of the sudden this shark fin goes menacingly by!&nbsp; I guess you had to be there, but me and Lauren freaked out!!&nbsp; We were the only people in theatre screaming lol.&nbsp; It was scary!    &nbsp;  Oh yes and i think it was tuesday or wednesday that Roberta was so kind as to send me someone's elaborate photo album of distubing pictures of people i know.&nbsp; Actually, they weren't that disturbing, they were funny, its just that i had a major crush on one of the individuals in the pictures and it was quite odd to all of the sudden to see that guy in that light....if you saw the pictures you'd know what i was saying......yeah, just ask me, i'll tell you the story.    &nbsp;  so i didn't really do anything today......Britt was at work, everyone else was at the Relient K concert at Six Flags and Ashley had puffy cheeks&nbsp;from her wisdom teeth removal and stayed at home.&nbsp; So i stayed at home and watched I Love the 90's all day.&nbsp; So far i think '97 episode was the best.    &nbsp;  Blogger changed their posting thing so now i can change my font and font color!!!&nbsp; which is what i'm going to attempt to do in this entry.    &nbsp;  And my mom wasted an ENTIRE BOTTLE of Raspberry Smirnoff Ice tonight.&nbsp; ENTIRE BOTTLE!!!&nbsp; Thats like my fave alcoholic beverage in the entire world and SHE POURED IT DOWN THE FRICKIN DRAIN!!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; All because she didn't like it!!!!&nbsp; See, at my parent's parties (New Years, Christmas, etc etc etc), since i'm older now, i get to have one of those tiny-ish bottles of that or i get half or whatever......and occasionally my mom will let me share one with her because she can't finish one by herself.&nbsp; Well she was all like "I don't like this raspberry stuff!&nbsp; take a sip!" and i told her i've had some before at one of her parties and she let me have like 3 swigs/sips/whatever and then she took it away from me and started to pour it!!!&nbsp; it was painful to watch lol.&nbsp; sorry to be ranting about my mom's wastefulness, but thats about the most exciting thing that happened today.    &nbsp;  $80 from work today! woop woop!    &nbsp;  alright i'm out.    &nbsp;  Love,   ~~~Taylor~~~

      alright update time for the past couple days!!!  Sunday: i went to a swim party with the gang  Monday: I LOVE THE 90'S NIGHT!!!! I went over to Nadia's house around 7:45pm to watch the first 2 episodes of I love the 90's....90 and 91!  It was pretty awesome.    Tuesday: work, then me and Lauren's last hurrah before she moves to Atlanta.  We tried on prom dresses and messed around.  Then we saw King Arthur....i would advise everyone who does not want to either die of boredom or laugh hysterically at stupid parts or yell at the desecration of the king arthur story not to see it.  Its 2 hrs of me and Lauren's lives we can't get back.  Then we went back to my house and said our goodbyes....I LOVE YOU LAUREN AND I CAN'T WAIT TO VISIT YOU IN ATLANTA!!!  haha everytime i go to visit her, i'm going to be singing that rap song "Welcome to Atlanta" by Jermaine Dupri and that other guy lol.   Wednesday: work, taped I love the 90's and then BROOMBALL!!!!  Everyone remember the last time i played goalie in hockey and my knees were black and blue and i couldn't bend them? And remember how i had to wear an Ace bandage on my left knee because it hurt so bad to bend/touch anything?  Yup, it happened again when i played goalie in broomball....except this time its my right knee that has to wear the bandage and my butt is badly bruised too so it hurts to get up. I made some goos saves, but i let in 2 goals (i think) and one of those was the tying goal.  Our team lost but we played the better game, we had a 3-0 lead for an HOUR AND A HALF and then they scored a goal and then in the last 15 mins they came back.  Luckily their winning goal was not scored on me, i couldn't bend my knees anymore, so i took myself out.  They scored on darrell instead.  We still rocked.   woohoo i get paid tomorrow! yes! money!  hmmm it seems like everyone is going to that relient k concert tomorrow....i didn't have enough money to go *tear*....  alright i'm out, my knees are killing me.  I hope they turn out as gruesome as last time!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      hmmm ok, i'm going to try and conquer my unconscious selective chronic amnesia and remember what i've done for the past 2 days....  Wednesday: work, hung out, discovered that my Lauren Caldwell is moving to frickin Atlanta, Georgia and i didn't know about it....we're going to hang out before she leaves.  oh yes and my mom decided to be cleaning nazi. Thursday: went over to Nadia's house and spent the night with her and Stewie.  We watched the "Sunday Night Sex Show" and if you've never seen it, its basically this Canadian show where this really old Canadian woman gets on and gives advice about sex to Canadians.  And they're all from Toronto or Kitchener, Ontario with the occasional appearance of someone from Vancouver, B.C.  Its pretty funny.  Stewie fell asleep first, as is tradition lol, and me and Nadia were delirious until like 2-3am.  At those hours of the night, we tried to figure out if the word "bitchin" could be used as an adverb.  We could not figure it out, but we did have a good laugh over that stupid word.  For some reason everything we said was hysterical.  Don't ask. Friday: is today.  and my friend from Highland Park, Emily, is coming over to hang out.  We haven't seen each other since the end of the Dallas Stars' regular season (we have platinum club season tickets together, we sit next to each other every game) and we have loads to catch up on.  Bound to be a fun night.  haha i told Nadia i had this dream that i met Daniel Radcliffe aka Harry Potter in a Laundromat.  We then proceded to make funny jokes about hooking up in a Laundromat.  I don't remember too much of it, because we were delirious, but i remember that she said things like "What kind of detergent do you use? thats sexy!".  lol good times.  i'm out, i need food.  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      ok so after i wrote that last entry, i literally went upstairs and talked to people on the phone.....and eventually me and sarah were like "lets do something" and then we went to see Spiderman 2.  It was a good movie, although it got kinda slow and me and sarah kinda started making fun of it after awhile.  hehe.  Britty - i know we were supposed to go see Spidey2 together this week, but i'll gladly go see it again with you, James Franco is soooo hott and Tobey isn't bad either.    Anyways, after the movie, me and Sarah went to Chili's to eat dinner.  I ate a $15 dinner which consisted of a full fajita plate, a drink and a plate of fries....which i ate most of.  I've never been so hungry in my life.  I think its the visitation of the little red friend.  Sarah wanted me to hang out for a little bit, but as i had been out of the house all day, i figured i needed to get home and make sure everything's cool.  It was and i read movie parodies...it was fun.  Then, since i hadn't seen Nathaniel in roughly 4 weeks, i decided to make a sonic run with him.  We hung out and we ended up meeting Ash, Brittnee, Caroline, and Kate dearest at sonic.  We all acted retarded before i had to get nathaniel and myself home before 11.  And now here we are.  All of these events.....took place by driving the manual car. what now gear shifting menace!?!!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      alright quick update before i go to bed....me and britt stayed up until like 4am or so and i had to wake up 8am to go see my bro in the parade.  Fireworks show was alright, except for the part with flaming particles (not kidding, totally serious) falling onto the audience's heads.  A few fell on my mom and one went down her pants and burned a hole in her shorts.  Also, a piece of one of the fireworks apparently landed in her chair also.  After the fireworks show, i went over to Brittany's house for what was supposed to be our big Vincent Lecavalier party because his replay on Leno was supposed to be that night.  How about not.  So we watched the outtakes and other stuff on the 2nd cd of the Miracle dvd and we watched Britt's Vincent Lecavalier slideshow that she made herself.  That slideshow was awesome!!!!  Just as great if not better than the Stanley Cup slideshow.  Then at about 1:30am or so, we decided to watch Miracle.  Of course, watching this took FOREVER, because me and Britt kept on pausing and rewinding at parts we liked.  We also had a competition of who's new fave Miracle character (Me = Silky, Britt = Johnson) was "in focus" in the camera more.  Silky so won, hehe britt.  Britt said that "muffled" shots didn't count....lol whatever the hell that meant.  Anyways we had alot of fun watching the movie and laughing and making stupid jokes/comments.  hehe "My Miracle soundtrack makes me want to kick some Commie butt..." good times.  Then the next day i had to get up super early because my mom was picking me up to go to the Independence Day parade because my brother, Dillon, was in it.  4 hrs of sleep baby!!!    After the parade, me and my family went out to brunch with our other family friends.  It would've been great if i hadn't been assigned to babysitting duty at the restaurant and my mom wasn't being such a bitch about everything.  Thankfully my dad bailed me out and let me drive his car home early after i had finished my meal.    Then, after doing my AcDec reading, i was so bored i decided to go to WalMart.  I looked around WalMart, checked on cd prices, etc etc....i looked for a cheap Harry Potter poster but the one with Danny looking really hott....but i couldn't find the one i wanted.  Then i came home after going to sonic and went all over the net looking for cheap posters.  I finally remembered where i got my Ferri Bueller's Day Off poster really cheap and i found my HP poster at the place called www.stage-fright.com!!!  only $17!!!!  Everyone should go to that site, they have really cool stuff there.  Anyways, i didn't buy it yet because i decided that i would buy my MIRACLE POSTER first since at AllPosters.com, they were having a free shipping and handling weekend.  So i got my Miracle poster for $20!!!  yaaaay!!!  i've already got a space planned for it.    After that, i drove my brothers to blockbuster, came home, ate dinner aaaaaaand here we are.  Since i have only had 4 hrs of sleep, i'm going to go now....and my mom is being retarded and trying to read over my shoulder, so i need to go.  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      hmmmm yesterday i didn't do anything.....and it felt good  Oh yeah has anyone noticed that the people who own Wild 100 have gotten taken over again?  Wild 100.3 fm is now 100.3 Jack fm.  What the hell?!  thats the stupidest name for a radio station EVER.  So yeah, no more Fitz radio programe, no more Billy the Kid or Special Ed (maaan i'm going to miss Billy, he was sooo funny) or Michelle the Lesbian (they called her that even though she wasn't a lesbian).....Jack Fm sucks!  Well i guess its kinda good because there are absolutely NO commercials.  But their slogan is "don't call us and tell us what to play, we play what we want, when we want".  and i was like wow, that sucks, no more requesting songs.  And they play alot of 70's and 80's music as well as early 90's and unless you're a nerd like me who loves nostalgic songs from those time periods, you're not gonna like it.  Sorry to say it doesn't look like its going away any time soon.   tonight i have to go to this stupid fireworks show with my family which is going to be boring....bringing the cds baby!  I absolutely hate fireworks.....but this is largely because i am afraid of fire and because i have seen a million fireworks shows and to be honest they're all the same.  but its mostly because i hate fire.  If you've ever been in a science class with me, you know that there are 2 things that i won't do: dissect things (don't screw with the worms man!!  lol Lauren, pre ap biology freshman year, how i miss it) and light matches/bunsen burners.  Devon took the liberty in IPC first tri of lighting matches and blowing them out (so there was no way i would catch on fire) and throwing them at me just to watch me run to the other side of the classroom freaking out.  He thought this was very funny. Although he felt bad when i almost burned him with a match trying to light one.  after the fireworks, i'm going over to Britt's house for our Vincent Lecavalier party.  woot  gotta go!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

      alright basically, i can't remember anything i did this week except for hanging out with Britty/spending the night at her house on tuesday, schedule pickup on wednesday and shopping for school stuff today.  oh and on a more interesting note, me and britt had extremely amusing conversations at around 2am on tuesday night, but i think no one would understand them if i wrote them down.  tomorrow is the insanity that is tax free weekend and my mother is dragging me into that lot of people in that mall.....oh joy  hope i survive!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~

Then i went to GIG at Mrs. Ferguson's house with the gang.  friday: hmm....i stayed home and hung out.  i can't remember if i finished my coupling season 3 dvd tonight or the night before....but it was good!  patrick and sally finally admitted they loved each other, steve and susan are having a baby and jane....well....she is kinda alone and so is jeff.  but it was such a great season finalle!  now i just have to wait until season 4 is on dvd!   saturday: me and connor went on our first date (at least i think it was a date?).  we saw "The Village" (greatest movie ever by the way, not scary at all and its not meant to be).  it was fun, we should go out again sometime i think and he agreed.   today: hmmm probably not going to do anything  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
