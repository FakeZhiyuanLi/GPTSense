                Yes so I have changed my blog name to Blogger Nation.  And I do realize that it was once my blog name.  But after reading the adventures of Ben Worley and his blog, I realized: we are a blogger nation.  Also, as Whitney Huff pointed out the other day when I told her to visit my blog, she said, "Seems like everyone has a blog now-a-days."  I don't think she said now-a-days...  But something like that.  Look for more insightful blogs in the near future.  And tell me if the little icons are moving, and if they are, tell me if they are annoying.    Clint

        Exhaust Pipe   You know those days where you feel like taking a nap and not doing anything for the rest of the day, but you can't because you have other priorities.  That's me right about now.  I have some homework to do, but my brain has been completely fried from the exhaustion that is high school.  I want to do it, but I can never remember what that one subject is that I know I have homework, but I just can't remember.  Man that's frustrating...  Luckily it's not a Wednesday, I usually get really stressed then because I have to do everything before church, and they start so freakin' early now-a-days.  I'm going to leave now, hopefully I'll search my backpack and realize that I don't have that much Homework, and then I can sit down, clear my brain and do my bible study...  And then turn right around and watch Friends, Will and Grace, and E.R.  Yep, I'm a sinner.  Clinton

        Ah...  Love.             So the girl I thought was the one for me, and I would spend the rest of my life with...  Isn't.  I was going to ask her to the homecoming stuff on Friday, I was walking towards her and I found her new "interest" she was hanging all over him.  I immediately kept walking, then when I arrived home later that day I realized I was sick of this.  I had been waiting for two years, and I had been heartbroken everytime she got a new boyfriend.  And I hated going through all this crap.  And I know you're gonna say well if it was true love you would have waited.  Well, I thought that also, so I went to the dance after the game that night and I realized, I didn't need her.  I was always comparing other girls to her.  I didn't need to do that anymore.  I didn't need her.  It felt great to finally get that weight off my shoulders and not be afraid to talk to another girl now.  Wow, He works in mysterious ways...  Actually more weird than mysterious.  Clint

       The Pirates Life for Me             The other day I was looking for the jolly roger symbol so I could put it on me blog, and I stubbled across this website that is one big competition.  There are different teams that you can join and you make your own webpage, it's really cool because it has a pirate theme to it!  And as most of you know, if I was born in earlier centuries I'd be a pirate, cause I love pirates.  It's veird I know.  Anyways, I requested to be on one of the teams and now I'm waiting for a reply, so  hopefully I will have a website with pirate stuff, I'll have a link on this webpage for it.    ARGH!

       Gods and Yawns   I went to get my haircut today, and before we went home I asked me papa if we could rent a movie.  I ended up getting Gods and Generals cause I was waiting for it to come out.  I started it pretty much right when I got home, cause I thought you know 4 hours long.  SOOOOO glad I didn't go to the theatre.  Oh my gosh boring.  I've only watched an hour of it and there has been one battle and it made absolutely no sense, they talk to fast and they never explain enough about who is who.  So I'm not even going to finish it.  Hope somebody gets this today, cause I wanna do something tonight.    Clint

       Fun Night   So we lost our own homecoming game, but....   Well there is no but to that, we lost our homecoming game.  Next year we will have people actually coming home now.  I got home after the game and thought you know what screw it, so I got dressed and went to the dance.  And if you have ever wondered where all the hormones and erections go at our school, it is there.  There were teachers there and they were keeping an eye out, but they didn't do anything of course.  And good Lord, I haven't seen that kinda of stuff... pretty much ever, yeah I never went to the woodland dances so I had no clue about what goes on.  HOLY CRAP it was actually disturbing.  Oh well, I'll most likely go to the next one anyways.  Clint P.S. No I did not dance.

       Wallflowers   I've read about thirty pages of the perks of being a wallflower and I actually do like it, it's about a 15 year old kid writing letters to someone anonymous to the reader.  It's basically about his discoveries of teenage life and what goes on, you might think it a little...  provocative (right word?) but it really does give a good perspective about a 15 year old boy who is discovering himself.  So far I aprove.  Clint

       Patience is a virtue, but I don't have time for it.  Man, love is a beautiful thing, but dang waiting for it takes forever...  There's a girl, and I'm not so sure the girl likes me...  But i've liked her since I met her many years ago.  Over the years I have gotten to know her and realized that it wasn't the looks I was in love with, it was  her .  Her mind, the way she thought, the way she looked at things.  I think I then realized that real love was from the neck up.  And man she's awesome, I'm crazy about her!  I use to think that I would get over her in a few weeks but that didn't happen.  Usually if it's lust you tell someone you like her and the feeling kind of leaves...  But I've shared it with a bunch of people and I still can't get her out of my head.  Don't ask me if you don't know who I'm talkin about I'm not sure I wanna tell anyone else, cause if I need help with what I should do, I don't what them to "know" you know?  Anyways, see yeah at church if you're goin' if you're not you're weird, unless you have an excuse then you're ok.  Clint

       Thought of the Day        You know what's wrong with the world today.  Everyone is so caught up in themselves that they don't see how they are treating others.  Seriously, people wonder why gothic people dress the way they do, it's because they've judged them so much, that they feel worthless.  Others dress that way because it's a form of self expression.  I was in Hot Topic the other day, and my mom walked in and I was lookin' at shirts (almost bought one actually) and as we walked out my mom said,"that place gives the creeps."  The number one thing I loath with everything I have is when other people judge people before they even learn there name.  Most of those people in there are the most down to earth people you could ever meet!  They're fun, smart, and good kids.  Others just don't take the time to get to know them and don't realize how brilliant they truly are.  There are always rumors goin' around schools no doubt, and a lot of people avoid those people that were in the rumor becuase of what they have heard, most of the time it isn't true but somtimes it is, sure it was a mistake that they made but that doesn't make it right to: continue the rumor, stay away from them because of the rumor, or just plain and simple judge them because of it!  Gah!  I'm a little angry right now and I've said quite a bit already, so I'm gonna go.  Hopefully I have made a point.  Clint

       Friday the 31st.   Well, today was an eventful day.  I was picked up after school by the gracious Debo Morris and was allowed to attend their activities at the Mckrell's house.  We had a lot of fun, and I am exhausted from playing with the tons of little children and their dogs.  So right now I am at my sister's house, she's at another apartment at a party, so I'm probably going to be alone for a while.  I have some issues to blog about concerning school...  again...  but that can wait for another day.  Can I some candy, Clint

       I don't procrasinate candy...  That count?   Seriously, does the madness ever end?  I have been waiting for the weekend for so long.  I think in my preparation for the weekend I have completely neglected work.  I barely ever do homework...  This is NOT a good habit I have come to find.  I'm even procrastinating packing, I have to pack for this weekend cause I'm staying with my sister, which she is not happy about, and I haven't even done that!  Huh boy.    Now I'm me this time, Clint

       "Slowly breaking through the day light."   This morning as I got ready for school (or satan's shagpad if you will) I heard on the radio that the gospel of John has been made into a film.  No, it's not The Passion by Mel Gibson.  It's actually entitled The Gospel of John.  It sounds very good, it comes out November 7th, and I already have decided I want to see it opening day, so if anyone else wishes to join me, ring me up.  And The Passion does not yet have a release date I think, I'm not sure.  But when that comes out, I'm all over it.  Let it be, Clint

       "In my place, in my place."   Okay, now I can really get into the subject of me hating high school and popularity.  Because it's really starting to bother me, usually it doesn't but after a few days of not having a good friend to talk to except for one, it starts to get to you.  I hate high school because it is one big contest to see who can be more popular, more beautiful, and more wild.  I basically have no good friends becuase the moment I try to talk to them and they see someone more poular, I'm invisible.  I think that I didn't really realize what "be individual" meant until now.  I've finally found my true place, I don't have friends at that school because I'm trying to be someone I'm not.  And I can either choose to be that someone who isn't me, or be what I really am.  And if there are other people like that along the journey, then I'll have a friend.  I'm finally free!  Free from the shackles of my peers; I feel awesome now.  I've also realized how great God can be in the worst moments of your life.  I think He works His greatest then, I don't know the exact quote from C.S. Lewis, but God was definately yelling at me.  I realized when I was in the worst state, what life is really all about.  It's not about popularity, it's not about sex, it's not about being invited to a party and getting wasted; it's about Him, and spreading His greatness.  When I felt like I was all alone, He was screaming, "NONE OF THIS MATTERS!  Quit cryin' you sissy and live your life!"    I still want advice, Clint

       "I can't stand to fly, I'm not that naive."   I hate high school at the moment, thought I would share that, I don't really have time to go into why, but I hate it.  And don't tell me to cherish while I can or any of that crap.  I cherish it, just not the people in the school.  And I still need a home...  Will you be my home?  Not in the hiz-ouse cause I don't have one, Clint

       The Price is Life!   Welcome back to The Price is Life!  The game that crucifies you when you are judged or not cool.  Let's go to our first contestant coming from a live feed in Ravenwood High School.  He is out the hallways hoping to socialize.  He's starting to aproach a group of guys.  OH NO!  He can't find a gap in the circle, man if he doesn't find a spot quick he is going to be judged and won't have anyone to talk to for at least the next hour.  And now it appears the bell has rung so he's heading for his class, oh no!  He's talking to the teacher like she's a normal human being.  That's major negative tallying on his score sheet.  I can see his entire high school popularity going right down the drain.  That's all the time we have for now, join us tomorrow as we watch another contestant try to talk to a girl he has no chance with!  Until then, don't talk to strangers or losers!  Hating Popularity, Clint

       Disease.   I suffer from a disease called, "Procrastination insomnia".  For those of you who are not familiar with it.  The subject procrastinates all homework the entire day and then waits until he/she is tired and ready to sleep to do the work.  The subject realizes the situation and instead of staying up and doing the work, he/she stays up anyways listening to music, or blogging.  If the subjects decides to ignore this work, it follows him/her to the next day causing stress and late or bad grades in the class.  Further more, this disease has caused great grief and sorrow to the carrier.    An antidote is in the works, Clint

       "Love, love, love"...  For The Beatles.   My mom went out and finally bought the album "1".  The greatest hits/number one charters for The Beatles.  And I can't stop listening to it, they are addictive.  Even the cheesey 1962 songs that everyone loved are awesome.  I just wanted to share that.  Wiping away the tears, Clint

       Interesting...  Very interesting.   I meant to talk about this yesterday, but I didn't.  In Sunday school we were talking about judging others, and how we should just except them for who they are.  I know it's cheesey but the outcome was interesting.  One of the kids said look at David Ramos!  It's kind of hard to be nice to him.  Now David was not in the class, but his friend was.  And a few of the kids continued about how he wears eye liner and wears his sisters gym shorts.  Granted a little weird but...  The friend raised his hand and said that David just doesn't like to be judged and he's really not weird he's a cool guy.  And then suddenly the air changed completely, the room was filled with, "Yeah he's a cool guy, yeah."  I thought to myself, wow this is depressing.  We automatically think that the person isn't around so we can talk about them, but we never think about who else is around us and if they might be hurt.  It wasn't David who was hurt, it was his friend.  And most likely his friend told David that they were talking about him, and now David probably won't return...  Sorry I'm just a little teed about that.  Pondering about human habits, Clint

       Pardon the Interruption............  Please.   I wanted to clear one thing up about the entry about this girl I'm crazy about.  I don't just sit around all day thinking about her.  I do sit down and think about her.  But not all day.  I hope people that read my blog don't think that all I ever do is sit and blog.  It seems I'm sending that message to a lot of people.  I do go out and do things, and I do "socialize", and for the love of God I am individual!  It seems that "Be individual" is a phrase that people like to use around here.  I AM INDIVIDUAL.  The next person that says be individual to me will be drop kicked and then have their arms broken in eight ways and have their fingers sent to every closest relative!  Go ahead say it...  I DARE YAH.    Friendly announcement from, Clint Alwahab

       Enter the Blog.   Not much to blog about today.  The Brazil team got back today though, that's cool.  I got presents :-D.  I also got my Enter the Matrix game back from Darrel G.  and I have already loaded it on my computer and I'm half way through it in one day.  I'm proud to be a loser.  I watched the first four hours of 24, and was blown away, I love it.  I've got to watch the rest before Tuesday cause the new season premieres.  And on Wednesday The OC finally makes its return, it was delayed cause of baseball, but now it's back.  That's one of my favorite shows.  If you haven't watched it, watch it, I've said this before but you can totally see Brentwood in that show.  Anyways, I learned how to play smoke on the water on geetar.  Not much to it though.  I'm gonna go cause this is the most worthless blog, I just felt like I should talk about my day.  Catchin' it on the flip side, Clint (That sounds weird)

       Seriously, honestly, really.   Lately I haven't been able to get Her out of my mind.  I'm doing the usual complete chicken thing and referring to the love of my life as "Her".  But whenever I am watching t.v. or even just sitting there I'm thinking about Her.  I think what if She were here, or this would be 80 trillion (yes trillion) times better if She were here.  I stay up all night thinking about Her, not in a perverted or "sensual" way, just what life would be like with Her around.  I'm absolutely crazy about Her!  Advice is needed, even though it has been given a million times.  One peice of advice I know I'll hear is: there are others girls out there...  (But they aren't like her.)  Truly, cruely, brutally, Clint

       No feeling in my legs.   Man, I didn't even spend the night in the church and I am exhausted from the 24 hours for Him event.  It was very tiring but I loved it.  I love dealing with the little kids, they're a lot of fun.  The day consisted of getting up at 7, eating breakfast at the church, helping a leader teach 3rd graders.  Big worship was when I folded bags to serve chic-fil-a lunch.  Then I helped Jon Merryman move a giant toaster and cereal box upstairs to the children's ministry area...  We had to carry the giant box...  Not cool.  Then big group and rec and coloring paper bags for room in the inn.  Then clean up during small groups...  All in all it was a long day.  And I heard that the sleeping part was a BLAST.  Sam Wey only got an hour of sleep.  There was projectile throwing up, hyper little boys that smelled like feet and odorized sweat.  But all of that was so much fun, I loved it.    Massaging the bruises, Clint

       "It's been a bad day."   Man, Friday's aren't suppose to be this gruesome.  Are they?  This entire school day has been a bomb site.  The explosion went off the minute I started third period.  Hunger struck at the most inconvenient time, and sleep overcame me in fifth.  After school I had to go help my dad with this floor, and I was suppose to go to the church tonight tp help with the 24 hours for Him kids thing.  I called Jon and told him about my day, and if I could just come in tomorrow morning, he said yes thankfully.  So now what I am going to do is make a grilled cheese sandwich, listen to some Pete Yorn and Coldplay, and rest.  Have a good day, I'm going to try to make mine better.  It was good in the begining, Clint

       Finally, I bought a CD.   You have no idea how many years it's been since I have bought a CD with my own money.  I went to Target with intentions of buying either The Matrix Reloaded CD because music rocks booty, or David Crowder cause Seth won't link me.  Well Seth, I'm sorry, I searched the entire CD area with the greatest intent and they did not have it what so ever.  But I think you will be proud to hear that I bought Pete Yorn in it's replacement.  There was a big trial about what CD to buy.  I had either, Jonny Lang, Rufus Wainewright, Reloaded, Dave Matthews, or Petey.  They didn't have any REM unfortunately.  So I went with Pete "The Master" Yorn.  I'll keep the reciept just in case you feel like linking me Seth.  I might blog tomorrow, I'm not sure, because I have to get ready for the 24 hours for Him weekend with the little ones.  I've got some energy storing to do.    It was good in the beggining, Clinton

       Can't catch a break.   Okay, so I finally get the first disc of 24.  But I remember today that I won't be home until Saturday night!  I'm suppose to help the kids ministry with their 24 hours 4 Him weekend.  So, if you want to come to the church at 10:00 at night on Friday and watch it with me on the big screen tell me.  Otherwise.  You know what screw it.  I've just decided, if you wanna watch it Friday night, come to the church we'll pop it in.  If not, I'm just gonna watch it.

       The Beauty of a Movie.   I had an interesting conversation with my good friend Arley last night at church.  We were talking about the Matrix movies and she said she doesn't like them.  She said she didn't like them becuase they were too popular and too hard to understand.  I said that I think the very first time you see it, you have to pay attention very closely, and then after you watch it the first time, go back and enjoy the beauty of the film.  I personally think the car chase scene was brilliant.  I loved the entire Merovingian and Twins part of the movie.  And the Seraph and the Key maker.  Granted everyone, everywhere has seen them, but if you can understand them and you can enjoy the film more than others, you are the only one that has  really   seen it.  I thoughtI would share that because I like the movies, and my t.v. is fried from watching it all night.  Literally, if you watch it too much it starts to flicker, so I have to wait a few hours to finish Reloaded.    Feedback is mandatory, Clint

       Teenagers!   This story has made my day.  I know by the end of it, you will think me cruel and cold hearted.  Every Friday night, large masses of teenagers from all over Brentwood swarm to the local movie theatre.  Of course Wednesday being a Friday for us, half of my grade was planning to go see Chainsaw Massacre because, well it was a complete popularity thing.  And when it comes to popularity contests I hate them.  Not because I lose but because the popular kids annoy the piss out of me.  And so this morning I was talking to one of the girls that went to see it, only to find out they couldn't get in!  Finally the movie theatre system worked!  This huge group of kids bought the tickets with a parental present, so of course they had to sell them the tickets.  But the parent left before they went into the theatre!  As we all know the laws of the Cinema Constitution, no child under 17 can get into an R rated movie without a parent or gaurdian with them, THE PARENT ALSO HAS TO ENTER THE FILM WITH THEM.  So the buzz of popularity was humming louder then ever as they made their way to the entrance.  Only to find out that they can't get in!  Oh, I laughed so hard this morning when I heard this.  I'm sure a lot of you think me a weirdo now, I am.  But I like it that way.  The cruel and cold-hearted, Clintonious Maximus Alwahabious

       I'm an idiot.   Yesterday I published an entry entitled "What are you thinking?"  And I only reread it today after realizing how much I screwed up.  First I want to say I am sorry for saying the stuff how I did.  I didn't mean to call our church arrogant snobs.  I meant it to areas of people.  But I'm not going to continue what I said becuase I think I'm a moron who doesn't know what he's saying.  If I offended any of you, I'm sorry.  If you haven't read it.  Don't, because I'm deleting the entry.  Trying to find myself, Clint

       Good golly, miss Molly.   My head throbs with pain from the tortures of the day.  Don't get me wrong church was awesome, especially the little Seth Worley and New Guy guitar duet.  But honestly, I can't remember what I did 20 minutes ago, my brain shot.  I'm gonna bring a sleeping bag into my living room and watch a bunch of movies and listen to The Beatles and Wings.  Thanks to everyone who totally rejected the idea of going to see a movie, or go get coffee.  Which is pretty much everyone.  Oh well, when I get my mini cooper you'll all be weeping.  Hey look I can make sock puppets without the sock, Clint

       "I am inveenceeble!"   My parents have had this record player ever since records were invinted, and the speakers that go with are about as valueable as the sex scene in The Matrix Reloaded.  Being the technical wizard I am, I used my stereo system I have in my room to rewire the speakers, and vwa-la.  It's sounds as clear as a gentle breeze in the Appalachin Mountains.  You like my similie?  I do.  Now I can listen to Wings  At the Speed of Sound   with great ease and pleasure.  Thought I would share that, seeing as I have no meaningful subject to put on my blog right now.  Technically I do have a meaningful subject, but I don't have time to go into it.  Tomorrow, I'll blog all day, cause I'm not going anywhere, and all I'll do tomorrow is watch The Sharon Osbourne Show.  Don't laugh, it's an awesome show, she's a cool woman.........................  Seth if you say one word, I will break your knees.  In a friendly way of course.  Well, I just realized how much I have just rambled and that I need to go.

       T.G.I.W?   Ah, the glorious day that we can stay up late and fart like we don't care: Wednesday?  It's rather nice to have a week where your teachers are going to take up Monday's homework Friday.  It's rather nice to not have to worry about doing homework before going to church because you will get home late.  It's even nicer to go out for coffee and a movie after church, which I plan to do.  But I was perturbed to see my sister, whom I have bugged forever to read my blog, is reading Seth's blog  and  putting up comments!  Oh well, I'm not gonna whine about that when it's no big deal.  Amber, if you are reading this email me if mom has sent you any emails lately, cause we haven't gotten any.  Well, I'm gonna go listen to some old vinyl Wings and Beatles records.  Have a great day, I know I am.  Chewing a guitar pick, Clint P.S. I have decided that when I get older I will invent the flavored guitar pick, don't think about doing it though, I've patented it....  Not really.

       The Tennessee Job   So after my mom watched The Italian Job, she fell in love with the Mini Cooper.  Typical.  My dad and I had liked them before the entire nation knew what they were.  And we are starting to like them SO much, that we are planning on buying one!  And when I turn sixteen, it becomes mine.  Now don't think of me as a richy richy kid, trust me, I'm not.  I live in a log house in the middle of the woods.  (Just wanted to make that clear)  But of course being the good teenage child that I am, I went to  urlLink miniusa.com  and found the address for the Nashville dealership. :-D  Entrigueing jealousy, Clint

       Well fellas   Okay, Netflix is failing in the get things in the mail in time to watch them on Wednesday night subject.  I just looked at our account and they shipped the first disc of 24 today.  The estimated arrival is Friday.  So people who were planning on coming over and watching it, which is Darrel, and maybe Seth.  We will have to delay the viewing until either Friday or Saturday.  But if you like, we could go see a movie.  Not Kill Bill though.........................  Um, Sethers you said a while back that Chainsaw Massacre isn't a true story, it is.....  isn't it..............  Unwanted awakening from my nap, Clint

       Counting sheep...  And crows.   My sister left her Counting Crows cd Hard Candy when she went to college, and she said she didn't care, so naturally I have taken it and plan to never return it.  I've been listening to it, and I'm really starting to like it.  And for the past 5 months I have been trying to find the cd that has Big Yellow Taxi, the Crows version.  Being the retard that I am, I never looked on Hard Candy.  It's a hidden track, and I never caught on.  Oh well, the only thing that annoys me about the song is that they hid it so well that it's like two minutes after the track 13 song, so I wait for 2 minutes to hear it.  Just my observations.  Oh yeah, is their lead singer a pothead?  Yes, no?  Perhaps so?  Headed for Napville, Clint

I didn't watch the clock at all so it felt like right when I sat down, it was time for the next period.  Oh what a day!  And I got my homework finished in my car while my dad bought dinner at Costco!  So fast day, no homework, and I got my new backpack finally!  Oh ah feela likea singin'!  (He says in the Fat Bastard accent.)  Anyways, let me know if you want to watch disc one of 24 season 1 after church Wednesday night, 'cause we're watchin it!

As I read this person's blog I found out that the person is a christian and lives in Singapore!  I said hello on one of the comment buttons and since they were talking about missions I talked about my mom in being in Brazil.  Go to the blog it's very cool,  urlLink The Great Leap of Faith.

       That's my Daddy.   My dad is old.  And usually all old men do is watch t.v. and listen to talk radio.  So naturally my dad is watching t.v. right now.  And naturally it's a PBS sepcial on hippos.  That's right hippos.  And as I walking in the kitchen to get something to eat, I saw that some bird was landing on a hippo's nose and the hippo didn't like that.  And my dad said, "Clint, look at this, the bird is sitting on the hippo's nose."  And I stood there for a minute watching my dad sit there eating his "nightly" ice cream, and laughing at this hippo.  Then I realized how much of a little kid my dad can be.  It's kind of freakin' me out.  Thought I would share, Clint

        Back to the Basics.    Tomorrow is just another Monday, no different from any other.  Get up, go to school, leave school, have school at home, go to sleep, and repeat.  Luckily we have yet another break this week because of a teacher in service day.  Sorry Wayne.  And 24 should arrive by then.  I talked to Darrel and he said he would come over and watch it Wednesday night after church.  Sounds like a good plan, so we're stickin' with it.  For those of you that would like to watch Season 1 disc one of 24 come to my house after church Wednesday.  Email me and I'll give you directions.  I hope you are enjoying the sounds of Enya right now.  Just in case you can't hear the music Jay, I figured out how to put music on my website.  And I have a little scrolly thing.  I got the info on how to put it on there from one of the people in Singapore that I have a link to, click Yueheng.  Anyways, I had better go do some homework, I've procrastinated enough this weekend.    Clint

       "You'll Never Stop the Real Napster."   My good friend Darrel Girardier (did I spell it right?) told me a few weeks ago that Napster will soon be starting back up.  Naturally I had to see for myself and sure enough, Napster starts back up October 29th.  If you register before they open you can get 5 free tracks.  Albums are only $9.95 and single tracks are $.99.  Very excited about the arrival as you should be too.  Thought I would share that, and now I have a link to Napster.    Clint

      Seth I think the thing that kills me is that I reply to your blogs in my spare time.  My life doesn't revolve around the internet and blogging.

       Dying to live, but just living to die.   Lately I find myself on the internet a lot, blogging.  And I usually read Seth Worley's blog everyday.  Pretty much every time he posts something I put something on the comment button, whether it be helpful or just stupid silly.  The other day he said I comment to much, and that everytime I think about blogging I should think of something I could do with real people.  I said that I had to have friends in order to do that.  And sure I have friends, but the friends I have I don't really consider to be the best of friends.  (That's not directed towards anyone in particular)  So then he said I was complaining, I wasn't complaining I was stating the obvious truth.  Trust me Seth I have tried to think of stuff I could be doing with real people, I call those dreams.  I don't have friends like that, and if I do, they aren't around.  Now, right now I'm complaining, and you know what I don't care if it annoys you or not.  You have made me feel wothless.  Don't email me to apologize or anything I just wanted to say that.  Thanks for the self-esteem boost, Clint

       Bloggedy, blog, blog.   Well folks, the first disc of 24 Season 1 did not arrive today.  Sorry to break your heart, but the fest will not begin today.  Actually no one has replied about the fest at all, so as far as I know...  It's just me, thanks for the self-esteem boost.  Anyways, all Ravenwood students recieved report cards today!  And I am glad to announce that are A's and B's.  The ones I reeeally want to brag about are Spanish and geography.  Geography is a 99, I repeat a ninety-nine.  Español is a 97, thank you very much.  Props to Jay Strother for getting the fall retreat forms out only a week late, I got mine today.  I still need some suggestions for easy geetar songs, I'm learnin Amazing Grace at the moment.  I've been told that worship songs are usually the easiest, but of course when I go to look for some new songs, my mind goes blank and I can't remember any song whatsoever.

       Much ablog about nothing.   I'm not going to go to the football game despite my week long plans.  I was starting to get sick of waisting my money, losing my voice, and being looked at as stupid freshmen that won't shut up.  So I'm stayin' home and doing nothing.  Basically.  I'm probably going to watch The Matrix and The Matrix Reloaded just because I can.  And if you play the guitar I need help on finding some simple songs that will help get me off my feet.  I've already learned Seven Nation Army, 'cause it is very simple.  But I need some more songs that aren't to complicated.  See yeah Sunday hopefully.  15 and wanting to fly, Clint P.S. Aaron, I'm going to start sending my blog to Jay, sorry dude.

       El Music es Bueno.   I started playing my guitar today with the help of mxtabs.com and thetabworld.com.  So far I can play the main part of Seven Nation Army by The White Stripes, and the opening of Blackbird but it's rough.  I'm having trouble with Blackbird because I don't my tabs are right.  I also found one of my favorite songs of all time, Glorious #1 by Remy Zero.  So if you play guitar and know any of things songs...  Help me the next time you see me.  Adios.  the next Elvis Costello, Clint

       Just another Science, Spanish, and Geography.   Today I think was the first time this entire year that I have had homework in every subject except for English.  Just my luck, only half of it makes sense.  The science was pretty much a breeze, but the fact that we have a quiz in that class tomorrow is what worries me.  Spanish only made partial sense to me, we just got these new verbs today and we have this worksheet that is rather complicated...  I would go into detail about what is on it, but it would be blabber to most of you.  Geography isn't too bad seeing as I have a 99 in the class, but today he assigned this section that isn't actually a section.  Ita maken no sense.  (Say that last sentence in a Chinese accent. ;))  Then there is the almighty and unwielding math.  Everyday, math homework hits me hard in the stomach.  Hopefully it won't be too complicated but I didn't bring it home cause I have directed study before that class.  So that's what my homework life looks like right about now.  I have however finished science and bits and pieces of spanish, but don't even think I'm going to do that geography.  I bid you farewell; in case I don't see you anymore today, good afternoon, good evening, and good night.  Thinking of happier places, Clint

       Got my swimmin trunks on!   I was just talking to a friend from school, and she said, "I really don't want to go back to school tomorrow."  I replied, "Yeah none of us do."  She said, "I'm ready for summer."  And there is where I realized how quickly our moods can change...  Nine weeks ago I was dieing to get back in school and start getting back to the norm.  Now the norm is the last thing I want to get back to.  Call it irony, but I call it mood swings.    Just a thought, Clint

       Blah blah blog blah.   I bought The Matrix Reloaded today.  I know a lot of ye fellow readers will say,"Why waist your money?"  To tell you the truth I enjoyed Reloaded very much, there were parts of the movie I felt were unnessecary or boring, but I still thought it worth my money.  Today didn't consist of much because of the rain.  I was going to take Tyler Torti's advice (see comment button from entry Bland Beyond Recognition.) and get out of the house and do something, but there was a misscomunication between myself and my mom.  I was planning on going to Rec. World and go to the batting cages to practice for tryouts.  But the rain and time held me back.  Perhaps another day, perhaps another time.  I also discovered that my mom ordered the first DVD of 24 season 1 and it should be here this week...  I'm thinking either watch it on Saturday or next week's Thursday because we don't have school.  Let me know if you wanna watch it with me.    Livin' the high life, Clint P.S. Rent Enter the Matrix, it's one of the best games ever.

       How did I get here?   Once again I find myself at the computer.  Blogging once again about love.  She has now read my blog, but I don't know if she read what I want her to read.  I'm so crazy about her.  I don't want to say anymore just because I will ramble and people will get sick of me.  Not much to do right now, other than sleep...  But I don't feel like sleeping...  Maybe a movie will be watched...  Maybe a book will be read...  Maybe I will shut the crap up and go to bed!    Have you ever wanted something you can't have...  Something that you felt like you had to have, or otherwise you wouldn't be able to go on...  Not like when you were a kid and you HAD to have candy or a toy...  That's how I am with this girl...  Who I might as well come out and say who it is, but the wuss inside of me won't let me.  Ah jeez, i'm rambling again.  I'd better go...  If I blog about love within the next 48 hours, and I'm not going out with Her then next time you see me, punch me in the stomach...  HARD.  Need sleepy, Clint

       Bland beyond recognition.   I feel so boring, and weird.  After having the little comment button discussion with Seth about living in our blogs, I realized: I'm boring.  Everyone that blogs makes like two entries a day, today this will be my fifth and I'll most likely blog again.  Everybody always blogs about how there day was and all the stuff they did...  All I ever do, is watch movies and clean the porch to make money to watch more movies...  Maybe it's just the fall break effect.  Help me get out of this house!  I need to go do something tomorrow!  I think through this blog I'm trying to be somebody I'm not, maybe I should tone it down a notch on the blogging.  15 and wanting a friend, Clint

       Italia.   The other night I watched the Italian Job at Kyle's, and I have to say I enjoyed it.  Of course it had that whole Ocean's Eleven effect going on, but I still liked it.  The final chase had some unrealisticness to it, but always worth a good laugh.  Before my mom got home I requested that she rent Scarface, her arguement was that she was already renting two movies, and we didn't need another.  She told me that they didn't have 24 so she rented Hollywood Homicide.  I asked, uh what happened to Scarface? She replied oh I forgot about that.  So now I will be sitting through two eyeball burning hours of Josh Hartnett and the dull Harrison Ford.  Don't get me wrong I love Harrison Ford, but in this he's supposed to be"funny".  I have never seen him do comedy, and the previews didn't make it look any better.  Same with Tom Cruise, that's another story, I have to go unpack from two nights ago.

       Hold up.   Well, my mom got back from Hollywood Video and said that they don't carry the 24 episodes.  Not sure why but they dont'.  So unless someone has it on DVD, it's cancelled.  Sorry to break your heart, course I'm pretty sure no one was planning on coming anyways.  I'm very optimistic about myself can't you tell.  But tomorrow, fo sho I will be watching The Matrix movies.  see yeah later  Yay I have a comment button, Clint

       Reloading Revolutions   I just remembered that The Matrix Reloaded comes out tomorrow on DVD.  So along with the 24 fest, we can pop in either both Matrices or just reloaded.  But in November, without a doubt I'm gonna watch both movies before the third.  Just a random thought that popped up.   See yeah, Clint

       Home grown and all alone?   Not much to do today, course I'm sitting by my phone for at least one call about the 24 thing.  I believe it shall be moved to Tuesday, because it was kind of short notice.  I read Seth's blog about living in his blog, I was relieved to hear this because I'm the same way, I'm not sure if it's because of the fact that I don't have neighbors, or because people don't listen to me.  I'm not sure, but I'm glad I'm not alone.  I think I have found the blog as my escape route to a hurt free zone; if I'm mad I blog, if I'm sad I blog.  Even if I took a whiz I would blog about it.  Not really.  E-mail me, IM me, whatever you wish, just lemme know what the deal is.   Not alone, Clint

       Appreciation for the Music.   Lately I found myself delving into CD's with a passion.  I've become dependent on music to take me away, away from the trials and tribulations that I face in school and at home.  The albums I find the most world lifting are: Parachutes and A Rush...  by Colplay, On and On by Jack Johnson, and for some great rock out music By the Way from my homedawgs The Red Hot Chili Peppers.  Most people I talk to have either never heard of Jack Johnson, or have heard of him but don't like him.  Some say all his music is just to slow, I thought that also when I first heard it, but I explored the "inner core", if you will, of the CD, and found some of the best pieces of music ever.  Coldplay is a gimme, everybody likes Coldplay except for those few who are all about the Sean Paul and Beyonce song.  Now most would say oh Red Hot Chili Peppers, they are sooo pot heads.  Most likely true, but I love their music, it's some of the greatest vocals and song intros you will ever let your ears indulge in.  That's just my thought on the beauty of music.  I'm also posting a lot of blogs 'cause one of my friends said I was talking about the girl too much.    Coldplay take me away, Clint

       A Day in the Life of ClInT.   It's Sunday night in the boonies, which means there is absolutely nothing to do.  I was going to watch The Red Sox and the Yanks play but it was cancelled cause of rain.  So they put on this disturbing but relatively close to the truth movie called Varsity Blues.  I didn't like it, I don't know why but I don't like the idea of a movie all about a varsity prep football team, just kind of annoys me.  Then nine o'clock rolled around and I flipped the ole tele to The Lyon's Den.  Once again I didn't find that much interest in it.  I'm not sure why, I think it was because I couldn't really concentrate on what was going on cause I was thinking about a lot of other stuff.  I decided that early tomorrow I'm going to get up go to Hollywood Video (props to Brian Waters) and rent the first season of 24.  I never watched it when it first came on, then the second season rolled around and thought, there might be something good to this show.  Now I'm starting to see the third season previews and am now saying crap I better get goin'.  So tomorrow I will be starting the first season, call me if you wanna come over and watch it with me, God knows I need the company.  Anyways, The OC makes its repremiere on Wednesday October the 29th.  I'm a little teed about that because I have church on Wednesdays.  That's the same with Smallville, they moved it to Wednesdays this year.  Oh well, I'll just tape 'em.  So I'm gonna go, not sure what to do though, not a lot to do in the middle of the woods at 9:30, other than go out in the woods and pee your pants cause it's so freaky.  Life's to short to kill yourself, Clint

       Killing Me Softly with Her Words.   I wanna be the girl who made him change his ways & give his all..the 1 he thinks bout when he says no 2 just "1 more beer" (but the 1 he knows he can call if he drinks 1 too many). I wanna be the girl he loves w/o make-up, wearing pjs & a pony-tail. I wanna be the girl he knows he can count on being there...the 1 who he cries 2..the girl when he sees in pjs, is wearing his shirt & holding his teddy bear. I wanna be the girl he never falls out of love with.. the 1 he loves more than yesterday & less than tomorrow, I wanna be the girl that he looks at & says 2 his friends..." THATS HER!"  This can't get worse.  I'm the person that loves her when she thinks she's not pretty, I love her when she's in a bad mood, I love her all the time.  She's one of the only people I consider a resort to talk to, about my troubles about life.  And she can't see it cause she likes this Patrick guy.  GAH!  Advice por favor.  Flippin' out, Clint

      You know, there are those few times when you are 15 that you feel like a 10 year-old.  Seth this isn't anything personal, but I hate it when people say, you can't go see that you're too young.  Granted it's true, but it still annoys the crap out of me.  I don't know, I think I'm babbling...  Hey let me know what you are doing halloween cause my rentals are goin to be in Charleston, and at the moment I don't have anywhere to stay...  But what are you doin?  'Cause last year I didn't do anything and I was bored.    Writersblock612@aol.com, Clint

       Lost in the vertigo of love.   Wow, I feel totally swept off of my feet.  A few days ago I said love sucks, but when you see the beauty of it, it is seriously awesome.  I sat by the love of my life today in church (If you haven't figured out who she is, we haven't met, or you are just stupid.) and just sitting by her made me the happiest I have been in a long time.  I never knew a person's presents could so awe-inspiring.  So I as we came to the end of the service and the prayer, I just sat there and thanked God for bringing her into my life, even though she is just my friend, I thanked Him so much for her.    And I just realized, if one person, one tiny sinner in this world can be so amazing and have a powerful presence think of what Jesus was like, think of standing next to him think how awesome that would have been.  So today I think I learned a little bit more about God and His power, and love and its power.  Wow, life can be awesome sometimes.  Sweet dreams are made of this. Clint (I actually used that lyric and it made sense!)

      Do you ever feel like you've missed your shot?  Missed a chance to do something good?  That's how I feel, I knew I shouldn't have gotten back into this track, the "track" is the girl I am in love with, as I explained in an earlier blog, she's back in my life.  And she's all about this new kid; I've never met him, and don't plan on it.  But she had this in one of her away messages: If you love someone that means you have a good heart.  If someone loves you thats flattering.  If you love someone and they love you back thats special.   After reading that I was ready to beat myself to a pulp.  She's never talked about love like this.  She likes this guy...  And it's killing me.  Don't worry, she never reads my blog so there's no worry, but if she is reading it...  Now she knows how I feel about her.  I'm in love with her.  15 and still dreaming, Clint

       R is for Violence.   Usually my mom isn't to restricting on violent movies, or movies with language like a sailor.  But today she said that I can't see Kill Bill or Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  Granted it probably was a good call because of the unbelievable goryness.  I know I will most likely sound like a pompus teenager when all is said.  But she's let me watch so many other movies that were just as violent.  Braveheart, Saving Private Ryan, The Patriot, The Matrix, The Matrix Reloaded, Scream, and a few more I can't think of.  I'm starting to wonder what the difference is going to be between them...  I have heard that Kill Bill is pretty dang violent, but my parents have never had a beef against violent movies, they didn't like make it a habit to avoid all violent movies.  But Chainsaw Massacre?  Are you kidding me?!  It's another cheesey teenybopper slasher.  AND a remake!  Allthough, my mom might not like the fact that it actually happened, but she hasn't metioned that so I won't either.  So I'm looking at the listings for movies, marking out all the rated R's and have come down to: Intolerable Cruelty (cha-ching he says in a dull voice) Spy Kids, Out of Time, The Rundown, Duplex, Luther (what?), Secondhand Lions, Fighting Temptations, Dickie Roberts, and that's it...  There are 3 that actually look good to me.  Out of Time, Duplex, and the Rundown I know I know it's the Rock but... you know, cheesey come cheesey go.  (I just made that up)  And all votes are leaning towards Out of Time, the new Denzel W. movie, it looks good, but I'd rather see Kill Bill.  :-D  15 and waiting for next year, Clint

       Totally Missed It.   We got home last night from T.G.I. Friday's and American Eagle, and I immediately got on the computer.  (dir) After a while, my parents went upstairs to go to sleep.  I got offline, and watched the ole tele.  I found on FOX 17, that the cubsters and the marlins were goin into overtime...  I thought yes now I can stay up for the whole thing!  I found myself 4 hours later asleep and drooling watching Thrid Rock From the Sun.  I had totally missed the game, fox news, fox friday football update after the news, and seinfeld....   I thouhgt, hmm, maybe I should go to sleep.  So I watched the rest of TRFS, and went to bed.  That's what last night looked like and I thought I would share.    Clint P.S. Who won?

        Love Bites...  Hard.   Wow, you're fellow blogging friend Clint Alwahab, has just hopped on the infamous roller coaster of death known as "Love".  After a few weeks of thinking that I was finally over the girl I was crazy about, I realized, it ain't that easy.  And I talked to a good friend of mine who knows the person, and she said that you can't just be crazily in love with someone for two freakin years, and then turn around one day and say you're over her.  So right now I'm in a state of stagnation, and utterly confused about where this will all go.  I keep wondering everyday, staying up till midnight, wondering what could happen if I did this, or that...  IT'S CRIZAZZY! (I used the word crizazzy becuase there is no other word to describe it.)  If any of the fellows have a piece of advise other than get over her, tell me.  Writersblock612@aol.com  Clint

       Is it blurry to anyone else?   Wow, good game RHS Froshies, fo sho.  14-7, we actually beat Brentwood...  Next year man, it's gonna be a revolution.  Today has been a very long day to me.  Got to school just in time, like 7:24, we start at 7:30...  And my first class is on the other side of the building.  Then there was, of course, the long and painfully drawn out day that is high school.  Then I had to rush home, change for the game, go to this job site cause me papa had to finish up this floor.  Then I went straight to the game, stood up for an hour and a half, taped the game, then waited for a good 30 minutes for me mama y me papa to come and pick me up.  So today has been a tiring day...  That's why my vision is just a wee bit blurred.  I'm gonna go listen to one of the ultimate stress relieving CD's On and On, from the Jack Johnson collection.    Have a scrumpcious day,   Clint

Which means we have to use AOL.  Which means my parents use the retarded parental blocking.  Which means it blocks EVERYTHING...  By everything I mean even Seth Worley's blog!

       A Revelation   I hate it when you are in a conversation with someone, and they say something totally against what you think...  But you say 'yeah' just to respond, and they say shut up be individual...  But when you  do   try to be individual they tell you to be quiet...  That seriously annoys the crap out of me.  I don't know...  That happened to me tonight, and I thought I would share that.  Oh yeah, I was kind of thinking about buying the infamous "Jesus is my homeboy" t-shirt/trucker hat; Darrel asked me though...  Why would you buy it?  And some other people said they thought it was kind of...  You know, not "right" like it was "degrading" Jesus...  I don't think it does...  Actually I just thought this...  I think Jesus wants us to look at Him how we want...  For some people it might be easier for them to think of Him as their "homeboy".  So no, I don't think it would be wrong to buy the shirt...  I'd rather have the hat though.  Anyways, just my thoughts of the day.  E-mail me, whatever...  I am still unable to figure out the comment thing so.    Clint P.S. I didn't start reading JP cause Seth talked about the CD...  Just wanted to clear that up.

      For those of you who are not in my English 1 honors class, let me explain.  The blog below this entry and this entry as well, are part of a visual aid I am using for my English 1 honors oral presentation.  If you are in my English 1 honors class...  I am right in front of you, so be quite.    The Big Snow                  The wiper blades of the gray mini-van continued to wipe off the melting snow that landed on the windshield.  My friend, Kyle, and I talked while my mom drove us home.  Looking out the windows we saw a long line of cars already building up from a car accident.  Coming to an agreement to take another path, we turned off the ice covered only to find ourselves in another long line of hot metal boxes.     	The first hour had passed us by and we had only moved two feet, if we had stayed on the first road we would have been home by now.  Kyle decided that he and I should walk up the road and see what was wrong.  Against my mom’s opinion we got out, immediately we felt the cold snowy wind freeze every bone in our bodies.  Walking along the crunchy snow we saw all the disgruntled faces of drivers and passengers, and then we found the front-of-the-line car driverless and turned off.

        The Perfect Storm   I compared my story to The Perfect Storm, because they were both about a fight against weather.  They lost important stuff on the boat, such as an antenna, where as Kyle and I lost the lead driver.  Of course, both the stories had their differences, like they died, and we didn't.

       Jurassic Park   Ever since the movie came out I have been wanting to read Jurassic Park.  Last year I finally got my chance and read Jurassic Park for my English class.  Naturally I fell in love with it, becuase it's Michael Crichton, and I read like a maniac and finished it like 4 weeks before the due date.  And in class we would read little sections and I loved re-reading them, never ever got sick of it.  So I've deicided to re-read Jurassic Park and be reinspired to write.  Oh yeah, I've started a novel, it's a about a pirate ship naturally.  Expect it to be published... never...  But you can read it!   Clint P.S. JP was my first Michael Crichton novel; so it,of course, is my absolute favorite Crichton.

        Stop Judging   Another group of people that I have found that people judge and basically reject, is the gothic group.  And I have a prime example of this.  I won't use actual names, and if that person wishes me to remove the following conversation I shall do so.  I was over at this person's house, let's call him/her Joey, and we were watching the VMA's.  And the Christian/consecutive (sp?) band Evanescence came out to introduce the next category.  Joey and I had begun to be interested in Evan. because they were touring with both 50 cent and Snoop Dogg.  Evanescence approaches their music with a sort of gothic feel to it.  Joey wasn't completely aware of this and as the band walked out in their black pants and dress.  Joey said,"What the heck, I thought they were a christian band." I replied,"They are..." Joey: But why are they dressed like that?  Me: Appearance shouldn't matter should it? Joey didn't reply and I didn't want to get into the conversation because it was midnight and we were both tired.  But I realized that to a lot of people think a christian is a suit and tie, nice clothes, no piercing type of person.    Not all christians are!  That's what makes our religion cool, we have all kinds of people who believe Jesus is out savior.  And we shouldn't think differently whatsoever because of their appearance.  As far as my research goes, Evanescence and P.O.D are the only Christian bands to be published as consecutive and be able to make big sales, and they are the only bands since I have been alive to travel with Ozfest, and the 50 Cent tour.  How awesome is that?!  We have missionaries everywhere and we don't even know it, because we percieve them to be gothic, but the gothic and the rapper fans listen to this music and get the message that is in it!    But that's the problem with our society, we are blinded by judgement, when we don't even have to right to judge one another.  We get so caught up in ourselves that we look at others that aren't like us or don't think like us and we say no you're no good I don't like you.  And that's why we have such a diverse community, and when I say diverse, it's not in a good way.  People have killed themselves because of the way they were judged and shunned (sp?) from the community.  The Columbine shooting was caused becuase of the way people tormented those boys and the way they looked for relieve, they looked for comfort in pain, and eventually in death.  And as christians we have to be excepting of  everyone .   Look at our youth ministers, what if Amy-Jo didn't like one of the girls that came to Sunday school.  All she ever did was torment her or completely ignore her.  That girl would feel like a piece of crap and would never come back toour church again, and would percieve (right word?) the christian community as mean and cruel.  If Aaron Bryant, God bless 'em ;), didn't like one of the kids that came through our door and tackled him and made fun of him everytime he saw him, that kid would be headed out the door never EVER to come back.  Now think about that in terms of your school, of your workplace.  Those places are our church, they are our mission field.  We have to be kind to everyone that comes through those doors.    That's what I think about goths and judgement in its self.  PLEASE tell me what you think or correct me where needed.  Writersblock612@aol.com still no comment button sorry.  Word, Clint

      Already, I have had a deep conversation with a good friend about the homosexuality issue, thought I would post it.  But he/she already asked to be anonymous, and out of respect I will change any names that came up in disscussion.  Writersblock612 [4:18 PM]:  www.clintonious.blogspot.com     Writersblock612 [4:18 PM]:  she's good to go      * [4:21 PM]:  interesting, how do you respond to those who know they're in sin and continue to choose to do so?  that's willful disobedience.   Writersblock612 [4:26 PM]:  that would take time, i can remember Someone I know was doing that, back in the summer, he was goin places with kids that had been to our church like once, and they curse and all that kind of stuff, and whenever they would do they he would say hey dude, why you gotta be talkin like that,and they would correct themselves and I could tell he was taking his time and slowly bringing them closer to Christ...      * [4:27 PM]:  yes but they are showing a desire to better themselves.  What about those who say there is nothing wrong with homosexuality, it is something that should be openly embraced, even if the Bible speaks against it.     Writersblock612 [4:29 PM]:  hmmm, I guess my reply would be, we should still embrace them with the love we embrace a heterosexual person with and except what they think but still bring them to Christ because what matters in the end is whether they except Christ or not...      * [4:30 PM]:  ok, I agree but...(give me a second to type it)     * [4:32 PM]:  You said you knew some homosexuals that are Christian.  If they're Christian, they are under the direction of God and jesus (the whole Lord and Master thing).  God says homosexuality is a sin.  If they, the gay Christian, are not willing to give up homosexuality or seek help, how do you address that.  Yes you love them but at what point do you have to go to "tough" love?     Writersblock612 [4:33 PM]:  hmmmm, thinking....      * [4:34 PM]:  it's a tough issue. the great issue of love the sinner, hate the sin     Writersblock612 [4:36 PM]:  probably, the tough love would have to come in when you have established a great friendship and when you know and he/she knows that they can take the heat and listen....   it will take time, of course, because this isn't an ordinary person who has most likely tried the "God thing" and it "failed" on them, you have to establish the trust of the friend and the trust of God... it think that made sense      * [4:37 PM]:  but does someone who isn't willing to admit they have a sin issue ever get to the point where they're willing to listen?    Auto response from Writersblock612 [4:37 PM]:	brb     Writersblock612 [4:38 PM]:  oooh, so true... hold gotta consentrate      Writersblock612 [4:39 PM]:  I guess that would on depend on the person, to answer that question you would have to be in that issue, you would have be living out this discussion basically...  So, it comes down to the sunday school answer, It's in God's hands... wow      *[4:41 PM]:  and you know the scary thing, God has given us free will to live as we like.  WE can chose to screw ourselves up and God will let us.  Scary...     Writersblock612 [4:41 PM]:  very     Thanks for the thoughts * keep it real, Clint

        El Topico Uno    Okay, so yesterday I said that I will be starting discussions on what I seem to be dealing with in my life.  Today I decided to adress homosexuality and goths...  Kind of a mix, but I thought about how people judge them right away.  So here we go!  I have found that homosexuals (whom I will refer to as gays 'cause it's easier to type :)) are normal.  I have met a few gay people in my life, and they are funny, smart, and good people...  Now some of them are christians, and a lot of them are not.  That is true.  But the ones that have decided to follow Jesus, and say that He is there one and only, should not be ignored or kicked out of the church.  Of course I'm not saying that the ones who aren't christian should be mauled and beaten in the streets.  But when they do come to the church door and want to learn, our arms should be wide open, in truth we have no right whatsoever to judge them and say you're gay get lost.    I was making notes last night about what I wanted to say, and I found the kicker, I found the glitch in the matrix.  Some people would reply to me, "Well they shouldn't make that decision or that  sin ."  But then why do you make the decision or the SIN to watch a football game before reading your bible?  Why do you curse?  Why do you not listen to your parents?  Those were sins last time I checked.  Yes the decision they make to conduct in homosexual acts is a sin, but so is swearing and so many other things that we do in our daily lives...  Any difference?  Please correct me if I am wrong, but no sin is worse than the other according to the bible.  I want to make one last point, and it's not as signifigant as the others I have made.  One of my all time favorite actors is the late Richard Harris.  I loved The Count of Monte Cristo, I loved Gladiator, and I think he made Harry Potter good.  He's gay.  Sir Ian McCellan, (X-Men, LOTR) he's gay also.  Dame Judy Dinch, she was M in the latest James Bond movies.  She's a homosexual.  All the great actors that we loved, are gay.  But I didn't know that when I saw X-Men, I didn't know that when I watched the Count of Monte Cristo.  They were cool people, and when I found out I said oh well I still like them despite that.  In my ignorance I excepted those people.  Why  those  people?  Because they were famous, I liked their movies, I liked their acting.  But when we meet someone, and we already know that the person is gay.  They aren't "cool" they aren't "normal"...  What is normal?  I'm going to stop here cause I don't want to say to much.  I'll cover goths tomorrow.  If a comment button isn't at the bottom of this blog...  I couldn't figure it out, if it is PLEASE put what you think or correct me if I have messed up.  If it ain't there, email me, I want to know what you think cause I'm still trying to see what other people think and what our religion thinks...

        Dinner and Jesus   Today is Wednesday, meaning we have church...  And as you know they serve food before activities.  It's not heavenly food, no no no.  But it's worth spending your time and your parents money.  And you could possibly eat with Aaron Bryant, that's right my friend the one and only church linebacker.  You can tell I'm bored can't you.  Food serves at 5.  Clint

      I've decided that I would like to adress a lot of issues that are going on in my life right now, through the blog.  I have made a list of what I'm going through right now and I'm going to start talking about them soon.  So here they are:  Girls (love or lust) Popularity/judging High School  Homosexuals/Goths/Other Religions Reading me Bible TEMPTATIONS Making Prayer a Habit Understanding My Purpose Getting up in the Morning Not Stressing Cursing Keeping Christian Image  Those are the subjects I will be adressing fairly soon, I'm going to search through the Bible and ask what other people think before I write about it though, cause I don't want to sound stupid.  Keep it real homies, if anybody actually reads this......  Check the blog daily.

You know, look like everybody." -Nightcrawler "Because we shouldn't have to." - Mystique.  I like this conversation because it says that we shouldn't have to be like everybody.  We should be ourselves and not be judged or ridiculed.  Please give your opinion.

       Irony beyond all reason!   I blogged just a little about this once before, my tv tends to flicker and die every now and then.  And by every now and then I mean daily.  So Friday my papa and myself are watching the ole tele while my mom shopped.  As we watched an episode of 24 the tv flickered and died.  So we sat there for a little bit giving Ferdenand (the tv) a rest.  Finally my dad said, "Maybe we should get a new tv".  I had desperately been waiting to change the living room cause it is boring as crap.  And now was the shot.  So when my mom returned from her rather unsuccesful shopping spree we all got in the car, and headed into town just like the clampets.  After going to a few tv places such as H.H. Gregg and Circuit City (actually that's all we went to) we found a cough cough 700 dollar flat screen 27 inch HDTV monstrasety of a tv.  On top of the new tv which I have lovingly named Fat Bastard, we bought a rather cheap home theater system with dvd.  Surprisingly the surround system aint too shabby, especially since we put in THX cables to boost the woofer 8 million times.    What's scary about this story is my dad.  A while back we went to look for a new head and foot board for my bed...  We ended up buying a bed frame, a matress, a bed side table, a new gigantor dresser, 2 new couches for the den, and 2 new recliners for the den also.  As you can tell, when you let the little ones roam they don't just roam...  They stomp.  So we went to buy a simple tv, and ended up with stereos "loud enough to blow the clothes off of women."  Naturally my dad and I woke up at 7:30 this morning to test out the system without waking anyone.  We've already watched the loudest scenes from The Matrix Reloaded, Pearl Harbor, and all of Star Wars Episode Two.  And on deck is The Lord of the Rings The Fellowship.  The irony from the story is, the night before the big holiday madness my dad told my mom not to "Spend out the Visa."  Then the next day my mom spends barely any money and my dad buys Regal Cinemas.   Hope you laughed at this as much as I did, Clint

       Let's give them something to blog about.   Well, Thanksgiving was very enjoyable.  That's all I can say, but our fridge already smells like turkey and pumpkin pie.  Which by the way everyone loved the pumpkin pie (I made it).  And now I sit at my computer home alone because my mom and sister got up at the unbearable 5 o'clock to go shopping.  And my dad is already back to work at a job site (He's a carpenter).  I should have added Finding Nemo to my movie list but it was unexpected.  I have to say it was a very good movie.  The Pixar Animation writers are brilliant people because they look at life and make it funny from every aspect.  (I used Seth's word: brilliant)  I also finished Daddy Day Care, and I have to recommend it.  I don't care what you say, you will watch it, and trust me you will laugh.  It's definetly designed for kids with the physical comedy, but Eddy Murphy is able to slip in the older people humor.    Lately I found myself wanting to talk seriously about stuff on this blog, and I can never think of anything worth blogging about.  So I've decided that I won't blog as much, even after my fast.  But still check up daily becuase I will still be switching the movie and music and stuff like that.    I'm going to put a quick prayer request up however.  Megan Greene's sister, Dana, and Dana's boyfriend Zach have been "missing" since Wednesday 2 o'clock.  So please pray for them and the entire family right now, and if you have heard anything contact either the Greene's or me and I will talk to the Greene's.   Prayers do so much, Clint

       Complicating the Simplicity.   I found myself comtemplating over what to blog about yesterday.  I was going to do the cheesey happy thanksgiving thing, which I ended up doing on the other blog.  So I didn't blog.  Today all I shall blog about is my sidebar.  As you can hopefully tell it has had some remodeling.  The CD's are stackable!  And my movie watching list has expanded too a small country.  The best thing about break is number 1: the food and number 2: the massive movie fests.  Yes I realize that Daddy Day Care is up there, but my mom rented the movies, and they were already out of Bruce Almighty.  Timeline and The Missing I think I will be seeing today or Friday, not completely sure though.  But if one of those two sounds enjoyable call me, maybe we can go together.............  Anyways, I thought you might want to know that my bible study has finally become a bible study.  Meaning I actually do it, and it's coming along great.  As are the grades.  Hopefully I will have another short story soon, I used a lot of my thinking juice for the extra credit story though.  I only wish I could show you my photography and my artwork, but I don't have a capable server.  If I know you, come up to me and I'll show you I usually have them in my backpack.  X-2 X-men United is calling now, so I'm going to go watch it.   "If I were a fool to think at all." Clint

       "Oh take me back to the stars"   I finally saw Elf last night after two weeks of deliberation of whether to see it or not.  The begining was hilarious but towards the end it got cheesier and cheesier.  The thing I enjoyed about the movie however was the previews.  This winter and spring is bringing a slew of great movies.  The two that I think will be good that I saw in Elf were Shrek 2, and the live action produced by Universal Peter Pan.  It's not by disney which means it will be ultimately awesome.  It's got the same actor from The Patriot and the father of Draco Malfoy in Harry Potter.  He is a fantastic actor and the whole cast is british meaning it will be awesome.  And even more intriguing about the movie is that they played Coldplay during the preview.  That was what determined that I'm going to go see it.  I hope you enjoy my Christmas wish list, and for the time being I am out.  I probably won't blog until Wednesday or Thursday.  Maybe Tuesday if making a pumpkin pie doesn't take up my after school hours.    "Home, where I wanted to go." Clint

       Breakfast.   Yes, I am aware that I am blogging, and yes I am aware that I blogged yesterday.  Yesterday was only of convenience to me because I was writing that article for English.  Now today I blog because I have finished all of my homework for the weekend and...  I have a few things to talk about.  The topic I'm going to adress on this blog is what I've read in my bible.  I haven't done much, but I have definetly found my favorite verse in the bible.  "'Come follow me,' Jesus said, 'and I will make you fishers of men.'  At once they left their nets and followed him." Matthew chapter 4 verses 19 and 20.  I think this shows how beautiful Jesus was, I think it shows the teeny tiny little taste the disciples got of God.  Immidietly they left their nets and followed him.  They didn't stop and pack up they didn't say goodbye to their family...  They just followed him, I think that shows how awe striking God is.    Just what I've learned this week, not much, but it's a lot to me.  Go to my other blog to see what I gave Master and Commander The Far Side of the World.  Hope the rest of your week is enjoyable.

       Muse.com's Big Fall Out.   Chicago- Jack Bernhart, president of Muse.com, yesterday announced the company's bankruptcy due to the return of Napster, many board members' resignation, and debts called in by the company's bank.  On the steps of Muse.com's headquarters Bernhart told the press, "Every board member was aware of the return of Napster, and they all knew that this quarter would be slow.  For some reason, some still saw it a threat and the rest followed there lead."  The first member to resign was James Calahan, a well respected business member that is known to resign right before a company's fall out.  He was afraid that the next quarter would not pick up the slack of the present one, which only made half of a million dollars; the total projection for the quarter was 3 million.   No comments were given by the bankers at Investor's Bank of Chicago.  The bank had been with Muse.com since the company began.  On December 12 the bank informed Bernhart that all the debts were being called in, a sum of 24 million dollars according to back records.  The company did not have the money to repay the bank all the remaining board members resigned leaving the company to Bernhart.                                                                          -Clint Alwahab   (I'm sorry but I wanted to get a preview out, this is a newspaper article about it, that I'm turning in for English)

       "I need a holiday."   After recieving the latest progress report from school I have decided that a break is needed.  I'm going to follow the foot steps of Patty (and Jesus) and take a sabbaticol from blogging.  I think I will only blog on Thanksgiving and Christmas break and maybe then I will be ready to blog again.  I'm going to work on school, my photography and art life, my writing, and most importantly my walk with God because it seems to be eating itself.  I hope you won't miss me too much.  You will probably still see me commenting on Seth's and other blogs, but for now I do not blog.  And who knows maybe by the time I get back my mystery readers Elvis Costello and Herbert will start commenting again.  (hint hint)   If you wanna talk...  Don't type. Clint

       Inspiration.   So Seth has put the motion back into my step and has caused me to take many "photographic" pictures.  I should have them up and running, but like I have said before: dial-up and yahoo as a server.  If you haven't looked at the pictures good ole Seth took at retreat, now is the time to do so.  They are fantastic, www.awakeland.blogspot.com.  Go now.  Other than that there isn't much to talk about.  Somebody start a conversation on the comment, unlike others I enjoy seeing people talk back and forth.  "Breakin' all the ground" Clint

       If I ever talk about love.  Shoot me.  I'm a loser.  I thought I liked this girl I thought she was the one.  And now everything is gone.  I'm a big loser. I don't  know what happened but...  No more feelings.  Thanks for all the advice although it all went to waste.  Moving on...  Hopefully within the end of this week I will be able to publish the first draft of  American Werewolves .  If you haven't heard of me little short story, it's about a big dot com business that goes under.  I hope you will like it, and I want advice on every aspect of it.  I'm gonna go work on my math cause I might be failing soon.  (Amber if you read that, don't tell mom or dad or I kill you.)  "Nobody said it was easy." Clint

       Dreads that lock.   Our speaker at the retreat was a guy named Chris Brookes (Chris if I got your last name wrong I am sooooo sorry)  But I had met him a few years ago at another church camp, I helped him with the sound.  Now not to sound racist...  cause I'm not...  He's white, and he has dreadlocks.  Obviously they are the sweetest looking piece of artistry in hair ever.  So I went up to him and asked him how he makes the dreads.  So he told me how to make them, and now hopefully I will have dreadlocks in a few months, but my mom is still thinking about what to say.  So if she says yes...  And so when I got back I was talking to one of my friends, I won't say her name, and I said that I might be getting dreads and she actually got mad at me.  She is still on the internet right now, I was talking to he like thirty minutes ago and she hasn't said a word to me.  So if I do get dreads, don't hate me...  Thanks.    iBoooooook, Clint

       Back to Normalcy.   Well, I'm back from Brentwood Baptist's 2003 Fall Retreat, and look I'm blogging.  Many things have I learned, like God is my friend and I can talk to him about anything and He's still ready to listen.  I learned that adult leaders that just got back from Iraq like to dress the kids up in his room in full camo.  Strange but sadly true.  And lastly I learned that Initiation into the Brentwood Baptist High School Guys cabin is pretty disturbing cough-hazing-cough.  But anyways, I'm back in action and plan on not being such a retard and addictive blogger.  And I now officialy envy Seth Worley of every possesion of his, I want an iBook desperately.

       "And now it is time for you to go."   Well the 2003 fall retreat for Brentwood Baptist Church starts officialy at 6 o'clock tonight.  And I most likely will not blog till Sunday, unless Seth brings his computer which I doubt.  Hope you miss me, but not too terribly.  I have a few things to blog about, but I have to go pack and I need to sit on the subject a little bit to see if it is true.    "I call you up...  You pick up." Clint P.S. I finally drew some cool stuff but I can't show it on the internet cause I don't have a server.  Hopefully soon you can see it in person.

          "Here comes the Spider-man!   Well I was just browsing around art.com and found the new movie posters for Spiderman 2.  And evidentally they aren't selling that great because they are already 18% off.  The reason I was browsing around art.com was to talk about winter, because I love the winter time.  Not because I get presents around this time, that's no longer a big deal.  But just winter, I love it, I love it because this is the time where you can sit in your house with a huge mug of hot chocolate and watch old movies that bring back memories of a much simpler time. And it also reminds me of friendship because every year I am always looking forward to the fall retreat, I've been waiting since spring for this weekend.  It's kind of a stress reliever and it's also just a time to get together with friends and just go nuts, and duke it out with the cabin next door.  Christmas is a big deal to me, but not for the presents like I said a few sentences up, I like Christmas because that's the time when almost my entire family gets together and we just mess around and joke and do all the stuff and normal family would do.  Now I get the feeling I'm rambling, but if you wish me to continue...  I won't.   urlLink My Private Nation,  Clint

       "Life is for living"   As I got out of school two hours early today I asked myself how the shortest day we can have in school can be the longest.  Obviously it's because everyone in the entire school is aware of the leaving early and they are also aware of the time every thirty seconds.  If I had a nickel...  I'm not even gonna finish that joke.    Me mum and I paid a little visit to the Goodwill store today.  I got some great t-shirts for this weekend, very excited.  That sentence made me sound like a total rich prick I know, but if you go on retreat maybe you'll understand....    One last thing, I need some tips on how to make 150 dollars by christmas, cause my mom said that if i pay for half of the ipod that i could get one.  Ebay, picture selling, and dancing on the streets painted in silver like a robot are my top three.  I NEED MORE SUGGESTIONS.  "All will be revealed my friend." Clint

       Sugar infested blood stream.   Well, we finally finished filming all the conan stuff for the weekend retreat.  Before I went however I stopped by Starbucks to have a little pep.  I bought a VENTI mocha frap.  Holy lord I could feel the sugar seeping through my bloodstream.  And then afterwards, I stopped by the gas station on Concord and bought MORE mocha frap.  I am literally shaking because of all the sugar, I'm gonna be in intensive care in a few hours if it doesn't stop.    WOOOOOOOOO  SUUUGGGAAARRRR, Clint

        I'm sorry, how much?  Well, lately I have really been wanting to get an iPod because you can now download from a windows.  But I went to the Mac online store and found out that the cheapest one is 300 buckos.  I told my dad that I would like one for Christmas, then I found the price told him and he said, well maybe in a year when you are 16, get a job and have some money you can do what you want.  Word of encouragement I have to say.  Oh well, maybe the cheap immitation will suffice, or maybe some serious bargoning would be better.  Broke and begining to realize it, Clint

       Waisting life.   I know this is an issue that will most likely haunt me for the rest of my life and will never leave the "Table of Problems".  People my age, people I have classes with and are younger than me actually, are getting waisted every weekend.  And here comes the encore of, "It gets worse," and "It'll happen".  But these kids just got into high school for God's sake!  Every Monday there is a new story of how waisted they got, and all the stuff they, "Don't remember" because they were, "Sooo  waisted".  It seems that most the people that I'm hanging around with, either in class or lunch, are all drinking regularly.  This has been going on since the third or fourth week of school and I guess today I just couldn't take anymore.  I've realized: Either I change the people around me or they change me.  I can make the choice, but it's extremely difficult to do that when they're bragging about the night before.  And I think the thing that knees me in the crotch is that a lot of the people that were talking about their "wasted weekend" today, will be going to Young Life tonight.  If that doesn't bother you, then we need to talk.  Comments.  "I wanna live in a world where making friends would be easy." Clint

        "You could run a red light."   I was looking at Jonny Lang's website the other day and saw that he's appearing on the Late Show on Monday the 10th of November.  If you've never heard of Jonny Lang you need to go out and by all of his CD's right now.  He's is one of the greatest artists around, I think.  But I am completely stoked about the appearance.  He's going to be singing "Red Light", granted it's not the best of his music but it will still be good.  I am sooo taping it.  You should tape it too, Clint

       SHE'D A HOE!   Personally I think Britney Spears is a very whorish woman.  She's just never expressed it because she started this good little girl image back when she was 18 and now everyone is  sooo  shocked to see her do all this stuff.  That is basically the essence of Hollywood: sex, money, and getting attention.  (Except Tyler, you're okay ;))  I have a theory, it's pretty simple really: Hollywood is high school with money.  And if you don't make headlines you lose everything.    Thought I'd share, Clint

       A new aspect on life, because of a movie!   I saw The Matrix Revolutions tonight, and my life has been flipped around because of it.  I would go into detail but I would give away the movie...

       Ironic Priority.   Well, today when I was sitting in my English taking a stupid quiz I thought how much my priorities have changed from last year to this year.  It used to be I would do homework when I got home and my life would be ruled by the computer or tele.  (Insert British accent when saying tele)  This year however is totally different.  Usually my homework takes much longer and I actually have to concentrate because of either pop quizes or because I know exams are ready to hit me with a Louisville Slugger in a month.  And today is not a good homework day.  I have a Spanish project due tomorrow, which is going good I'm almost done.  I have Science which I partially understand, math, geography, and English.  So basically every subject.  And the irony is I know I need to do this stuff and I've realized what is more important, and I'm here blogging, and I'm about to go see The Matrix Revolutions...  Irony beyond acceptance.  "Nobody said it was easy", Clint  (Any and all quotes in today's entry provided by Coldplay.)

       The Choices We Make   "I can't change where I'm from, but I can change where I'm going."                                                    -Ryan from "The OC"  Yes I know I am now Captain Cheese because I quoted from The OC, but I really like it.  I think this quote is saying that we can't really change the mistakes we made (aka sins) in our past, but we can change what we do next.  We have learned from those old mistakes and now we can decifer (word?) what is right and what isn't.  I thought I would share that.    More randomness: I have tickets for Matrix Revolutions for tomorrow!  So excited baby.  I read the newspaper article about it and it said that the original Oracle, Gloria Foster, died in 2001!  That's why it's a new Oracle.  (Random thought)  Danja!  Danja!, Clint

       If you don't like random blogs, don't read this.   I don't really have any "serious" issues to talk/complain about today.  So I'll do a little advertising for my first short story which I hope to publish.  It's most likely going to be called  American Werewolves  .  No it's not about werewolves that's a cover up title.  It will be about America falling into another depression, but we will basically live it like the first time because it's a generation that doesn't tend to listen.  I hope to start the rough draft today and most likely by the end of the month it will be publish ready/copyrighted.  Oh yeah my house smells like roach killer, my dad got a little bug happy and spray basically the entire house, including my room.  So I can't enter my room for a few hours because the toxic wasteland smell will take me to Happy Land where things float.    My eyes are watering, Clint

       America Reloaded?   I was reading the newspaper the other day,  (Not really, I just saw the article lying on the ground)  and The Tennessean's (Our newspaper for those of you in Singapore who are confused) Faith and Values section did an article on The Matrix Reloaded.  As most of you know I am a fanatic of the Matrix, and I love finding meaningful stuff in movies.  I liked the body of the article, but at the bottom of the article they had a box with quotes from the movie.  The quotes were obviously just picked because they sounded good.  Some of them had a little bit of a good point but they left out some really meaningful quotes.  This one I kind of like: The Kid, "I want to join the Nebuchadnezzer.  The more I think about it, the more I think it's meant to be.  You know, it's fate.  I mean, you're the reason I'm here Neo."  Neo, "I told you kid, you found me.  I didn't find you."  The Kid, "I know, but you got me out.  You saved me."  Neo, "You saved yourself."  I kind of like that cause it points out that we find God in our lives.  But at the end when Neo says, "You saved yourself." it kind of takes away the fact the Jesus saved us...  You know.  There are other quotes but I want to get opinions on this.   "Watch me now", Clint

       Urnedbay DC-ay.   Well, today was another eventful day, after church my sister and I came back to my house so I could change so we could go play in Crockett Park.  We ended up staying for about two hours taking a nap.  None the less we kept our goals and went to the park with some friends.  We played a short game of football then went to Raina's cause it got dark at 5.  So Raina and I went to her house, and she urnedbay a dc-ay for me.  (That's code so the Fed's don't have anything against me.)  So as I type I am soothing my knee to the graceful Norah Jones.  Yeah, I'm soothing my knee because I landed on it at the ice rink the other night, full force collision.  And then tonight as I tried to catch the touchdown pass I landed on it again only to miss the pass.  So now both my knees are messed up, I think I need surgery on one of them.  I feel like it's nine o'clock at night cause it's so freakin dark, my body thinks it's time for bed.  But it's not so I'm gonna go watch the extended Lord of the Rings.  In case I don't see you anymore today, good afternoon, good evening, and good night.    Just the same hard candy, Clint

       I don't do windows.   Well, tonight my sister had a preteen event.  It was ice skating.  Of course I had to go because I had been sittin' around all day.  So I went, and I have to say, I had fun.  Turns out I'm pretty good at it. I used hockey skates none of that sissy figure skate stuff.  So I'm a little tired, but I'm still goin.  I could probably go on till 3, I did last night.  So now I'm rambling, and boring you.  Adios muchachos.  Skating: the man's sport, Clint

       She loves you, no no no.   That title has nothing to do with what I'm about to write I just thought it was cool.  Who knows, maybe I will need to you use it in the future.......  But for now I want to talk again about this whole high school popularity thing.  I hate my directed study, I have these three guys in my class that are pretty much the most popular frosh in the school.  One is the starting QB for the frosh team and will be starting next year without a doubt.  The other is this kid who is funny, but a complete [Radio Edit].  So anyways they think they're all high and mighty, and then OF COURSE one of the hottest girls in the school is in our class also.  And all the guys treat her like meat.  And she takes it all.  But we have the coolest teacher ever for our directed study, and she has been letting us watch movies!  Any movie that I can bring in, seriously, of course we don't put in R's cause some of the kids had a problem with it.  But yesterday we were watching The Lord of the Rings The Fellowship of the Ring.  (I was inspired by Jay)  And we were sitting they're and I was able to pick out who I had heard talking a movie, I'm serious.  These freakin' kids would not shut up.  I even yelled at a few of them like I had some authority over them.  Before we started the movie my teacher said that we wouldn't be able to watch anymore movies except for special occasions.  And after seeing these rodents in action I don't want to bring anymore movies.  But if I do I'm going to bring something like The Right Stuff or The Count of Monte Cristo, cause they've never seen them before, and they won't talk.  Also, I realized in that class how much people don't appreciate movies. Seriosuly, these kids would not stop talking, they wouldn't stop asking questions such as, "What's that", "What's he gonna do", "What does that mean"...  SHUT UP AND FIND OUT!  I'm gonna go before I do any more damage, tell me if you wish me to continue.  It's been a hard days night, Clint

It's a long list I know but they are goals I hope to fill.  Predictions for this new year will be publised tomorrow.  Have fun tonight, don't get to waisted.  I know I won't.........

       What do you think Mr. Ebert?  Well, after much deliberation I have finally made my favorite movies of 2003 list.  5. X-2 X-Men United 4. Identity 3. Peter Pan 2. Pirates of the Caribbean 1. Lord of the Rings The Return of the King  Now please keep in mind I never saw 21 Grams, 28 Days Later, Kill Bill, Cold Mountain, The Last Samurai, The Missing and a few others I can't think of.  Coming in at ranks sixth and seventh were Finding Nemo(7) and The Matrix sequels(6).  I hope this list satisfies someone, I'm not entirely happy with it because I missed out on so many movies.

I have made a band that does not exist.  I totally just made that up.  Except for the band art stuff.  I have designed cover art for a band which shall be named, "Augustine".  This band does not have any members, yet.  Nor does it have any music or music sheets.  But this band will exist one day, and I hope that they will use my work.

      There are always those things that will remain 'college founded'.  Meaning every kid that went to college from this generation will know what homestarrunner.com is for the rest of their lives.  My sister and her friend have been 'homestarrunner-atized'.  They listen to Guster and quote Strong Bad every time we get in the car.  There are more little habits that I would only know about because of my college sister, but it would take too long to explain.  I find it interesting that going away from home can change a person so much, but yet bring us a little closer....  Now I'm babbling so I'm going to leave on that note.

         "Who Am I?" by Dietrich Bonhoeffer  Who am I? They often tell me I would step from my cell's confinement calmly, cheerfully, firmly, like a squire from his country-house.  who am I? They often tell me I would talk to my captors freely and friendly and clearly, as though it were mine to command.  who am I? They often tell me I would bear the days of misfortune steadily, smilingly, proudly, like on accustomed to win.  am I then really all that men tell of? or am I only what I know of myself, restless and longing and sick, like a bird in a cage, struggling for breath, as though hands were compressing my throat, yearning for colours, for flowers, for the voices of birds, thirsting for words of kindness, for neighborliness, trembling with anger at despotisms and petty humiliation, tossing in expectation of great events, powerlessly trembling for friends at an infinite distance, weary and empty at praying, at thinking, at making, faint, and ready to say farewell to it all?  who am I? This or the other? am I one person today, and tomorrow another? am I both at once? A hypocrite before others, and before myself a contemptibly woebegone weakling? or is something within me still like a beaten army, fleeing in disorder from victory already achieved?  who am I? They mock me, these lonely questions of mine. whoever I am, thou knowest, o God, I am thine.    Can you relate to what he's saying?  How would you put these same thoughts in your own words?   Yes, sometimes I do wonder who I truly am, and how I will find myself.  I've figured out that finding yourself does not really require searching.  You are who you are when you are doing what you like and live out life how you see it and not how others see it.  And no matter what people say or do to you, you are still yourself.  I hope this is the right kind of response you were looking for.  This was in my devotional book, and I thought I would talk about it cause I liked the subject.  However, I did not completely understand that poem, so if I messed up or missed some key ingrediant please comment and correct me.  Also tell me what you think.

      I have been highly anticipating the release of Peter Pan, mainly because it was one of my favorite disney stories.  So I went to go see it with my seven year old cousin and five year old other cousin and family.  And having the little kids with us watching one of the coolest origanaly disney movies now awesome movie made it ten times better than it was.  I recommend this to all who have ever watched the original cartoon, and try and get little children that cackle when they laugh to go with you.

      Okay, well on the six hour drive to Easley, South Caronlina I made a list of things I would like to talk about.  Some are more serious things, others are completely pointless.  I'm going to go ahead and get the totally pointless ones out of the way and save the better ones for another day.   1. Imitation of Life by R.E.M. is one of my favorite songs. 2. Coldplay rocks in concert, and I hope to get tickets for this year. 3. Coldplay is working on a new album, but no release date has been announced. 4. More pictures are on the way.  That's about it, the more important stuff, and predictions and new year's resolutions are coming soon.  Glad to be back home away from my strange family and glad to be back in the blogging world.

I'm not going to qoute any scripture mainly because I don't know any scripture for Christmas that would really get a point across and isn't the basic baby Jesus story.  So hope you've had a great Christmas and I hope the happiness of it lasts all year.

Also the time of year when Steve Gatlin reveals himself for this one-time-only Christmas song.  And, of course, the once a year chorus of little babies howling during the best Christmas songs.  And evidentally Jesus aint too 'alive' in me this year because right when I lit my candle during the vigil it burned out...  Very depressing if you think about it.  We laugh at all this, but I think deep down, we wouldn't be able to live with out the glorious Christmas Eve Service.

        Floating Heads  I took this back in November, I found the self-timer button and got a little trigger happy and this is what I ended up with.  There's not much else to say about this picture, it's just... there.  Those that are signed up for my e-blog have seen this before, if you are not signed up for my e-blog click the picture of me praying and e-mail me.  Maybe now in the near future I can bring other pictures I have taken, but for the time being this is the only one.  Tell me what you think.

       My Christmas Blog Wish  My only blogger world Christmas wish is this: those that entitle themselves on the comment button as 'Annonymous' or 'Elvis Costello', stop it and reveal yourself.  Don't hide behind a shell.  And I know someone out there is gonna give me that crap about it not mattering if I know people's true identity.  Don't pull that on me, I don't tolerate bullcrap.  That is my Christmas wish, and in extends until the end of time, or at least until the end of this blog.  And those in the future that decide to name themselves as 'Annonymous' or some other celebrity name, don't.

      Hope you like what I've done with the sidebar.  If I don't have a picture for your blog, maybe seth will take a picture of you and I can use it for a picture since I don't have a server.  Tell me what you think of it.  (If you don't know who it is, steady your mouse on the picture and it will say like the other pictures do)

      Young Man [Shot from outside a diner window looking at a booth inside, Young Man sits on one side another man sits opposite]: I had a dream the other night about my childhood. Man on other side of table [Same Shot, man looks interested]: Really?  What happened in it? Young Man [Forward shot, eye level with character, background other people in tables being served by waitresses]: Well, it started off when I was, I don't know, nine or ten.  I was in Sunday school and the teacher was talking about Heaven and that we would be praising God forever.  She told us this stuff like we were five year olds, I didn't like it.  So I stopped going to Sunday school- Man cuts off youth: In your dream you mean? Youth [Shot from table top (camera resting on table) coffee cup on right side of screen youth taking up the left side, youth is stirring coffee with a plastic stirrer]: Yeah, well no, I stopped going to church when I was about that age also, but I don't remember this happening. Youth continues [Forward shot as before, youth continues to look at coffee-NO EYE CONTACT]: Anyways, I stopped going and then I flashed forward to the first time I got beat up, I definitly remember that.[eyes widen then back to normal-still no eye contact]  Then, all my friends I ever had walked up to me and starting telling me everything I ever did wrong.  Now that never happened, but for some reason it bothered me, I felt like I was being judged by everyone I thought didn't care what I did wrong.  Then I woke up crying, and for the first time in a long time.  I prayed.   [Young man looks up at the man across the table] Man [Forward shot]: Well I've got a few verses to help you, then maybe you can start going to our youth program at our church.  But let's get to the verses first. [Camera slowly moves away from the man as he says this, shot goes through window and audio and video begin to fade as he finishes his second sentence]  This was totally just improv-ed right here and now, it was partially inspired by D's blog entry from October.  It was origanly in novel form but I decided a movie script would be a better decription of the shots.  Tell me what you think, I think it's kinda weird, but I totally made it up as I went so I figured it would be.

       Ah, the element of surprise  My aunt's Christmas presents arrived today in the mail, I was the only one home so I decided to open the box to put the presents under the tree.  I'll leave this to someone else next time.  I opened the box to find my gift on top, in a little bag, and the tissue had fallen out of the bag somewhere along the trip from Columbia, South Carolina to Brentwood.  I pulled out the bag only to let the gift fall out of the bag and discover my delima.  So for Christmas here's what I know I'm getting: The Two Towers extended edition with statue, Finding Nemo, and Van Morrison 'What's Wrong with this Picture?'.  I already knew about the other two because my mother is the easiest person to break.  Thought I would share.

      As I surfed the blogger world looking at Seth's, Ash's, Sam's, D's, Arley's, Kyle's, Kyle Oz's, Ben's, Ben Worley's, Tyler's, and finally my own I realized HOLY CRAP THAT'S A LOT OF BLOGS.  In just our little 'group' of friends in Tennessee and those in Waco we probably make up about 1% of blogger.com.  All the Vandergriff children have blogs, and they are awesome.  Two out of the three Worley's have one, though I think Ben has forgotten what a blog is.   urlLink Arley  rocks the creative blog with her thought provoking statements.   urlLink Little Tyler  hopped on the blogging wagon after I introduced it to him.   urlLink Tyler  has had his for a while talking about his adventures in Hollywood.  And the list goes on!  I'm not even go further, but if I didn't mention you in the blog, I did in my heart.............

        It was  bad  Okay  Let me give an official review for The Two Towers.  If you don't want to read this, don't.  The Two Towers had many good aspects to it, I noticed there was more poetic sayings in this than the other two.  The Return covered more of the musical aspect, and The Fellowship just rocked.  But The Two Towers seemed to put off this feeling as of just having to fill a void and make people say, "Dude that battle was tite".  I don't think Peter Jackson approached this film with the right attitude.   Some parts of the movie, I thought, were beautifully crafted and well put together, where as others were just there to take up time and make the girls say, "Oh I like her dress".  Also as I said Jackson edited out scenes from all three movies that were actually rather nessecary.  Then he puts those scenes on the Extended DVD so people will buy them and he can make thousands more money.  So in conclusion I hate and love this movie just as Gollum hates and loves the Ring.  (I know that was gay, but I had to say it)  Please by all means tell me what you thought, or tell me to stop talking about Lord of the Rings.

        She's growin on me  This movie is increasingly growing on me.  I know I said I didn't really like it, but I've watched it for only the third time and I have to say it's getting better.  Kind of like a CD, I've just got to get use to it.  One thing I dislike however is Peter Jackson trastic editing of vital scenes from the film and putting them on the extended DVD.  I watched the preview for the extended edition on the regular DVD and he talked about a scene that was 'a key connection that linked the Two Towers and The Return'.  I thought to myself, if it's so important why take it out?  Not everyone is going to buy the extended DVD.  That's pretty much the only thing I am disapproving of for The Two Towers.  Maybe a little disapproval of the romance crap, but yeah.

      I have an extremely bad habit of staying up till the wee hours of the morning watching retarded, pointless tv shows.  Last night at 1:30 Elimidate came on.  If you aren't familiar with it, it's about these 4 people competing for one person of the opposite sex.  So basically it's a bunch of whores giving lap dances to the lucky guy.  Then another episode came on, and I felt compelled to watch it.  This is what happens at 2 in the morning, you want to go away but you can't because either you are a weirdo who likes elimidate or you just watched a scary movie and can't it out of your head.  So I stayed up until around 2:30 and then I went upstairs read my book and finally settled down around 3.  DON'T EVER DO THAT.  P.S.  I'm not the weirdo...  I had just watched Identity again. P.P.S. I know the Norma Jean link is weird but I couldn't think of anything to say.

       Oogan, you rock  I don't know if you have ever read  urlLink Amber Oogan's  blog, but I just wanted to shine the spotlight on her for a little bit.  Amber is going through an extremely rough period right now, and the only way I would have ever known about it is through her blog.  What I found so amazing is that she is so open about her problems and is aware that she has them.  I would never be able to do that, I'm to big of a pussy to ever openly tell people about stuff like that.  (sorry for the language Jay)  I've found new courage, and hope, in Amber Oogan, you rock Amber and I'm right behind you every step of the way.  Everyone please pray for her.    Ooganator rules, Clint P.S. I made a few changes to the sidebar (new link to Norma Jean who I have finally found out the true identity of).

      I found myself walking around church today almost asking people, "Are you my Elvis Costello?"  Of course I realized how weird this would sound to be asked that, especially if the person had never read my blog.  So I will ask it here, though it will not help...  Are you my Elvis Costello?

       Exercise?  What's that?  Whatever happened to the good old days when kids played with action figures, and used their imagination to create little worlds of Batman and an ape from the Planet of the Apes movie fighting together against Megatron?  Now-a-days it's the X-Box or the PS2 that does the creative thinking.  At least kids actually ran around when they played with action figures, I found myself playing a video game for hours only moving my fingers and my head to see if my mom would bring me some more food.  Seems our next generation of America will be fat and blind from staring at a T.V. or a computer for so long.  Help this next generation by destroying all video games and make the kids run laps around their own houses.  Just a thought, Clint

        WoW  I rented this movie today, just finished it about an hour ago, and I love it.  This movie was so cool.  I'm not going to give a review or anything because I have to watch it again, and I don't want to reveal anything.  Go check it out, or buy it...  Now.

       In review of chapter 2 (That's a rhyme and I'm no mime)  "Why did you let me keep it?  Why didn't you make me throw it away, or, or destroy it?" -Frodo "Let you?  Make you?" said the Wizard.  "Haven't you been listening to all that I have said?  You are not thinking of what you are saying.  But as for throwing it away, it was obviously wrong.  These Rings have a way of being found.  In evil hands it might have done great evil.  Worst of alll, it might have fallen into the hands of the Enemy.  Indeed it certainly would; for this is the One, and he is exerting all his power to find it or draw it to himself." -Gandalf ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ "No.  But I suppose one could hammer it or melt it." -Frodo "Try!" said Gandalf.  "Try now!" Frodo drew the Ring out of his pocket again and looked at it.  It now appeared plain and smooth, without mark or device that he could see.  The gold looked very fair and pure, and Frodo thought how rich and beautiful was its colour, how perfect was its roundness.  It was an admirable thing and altogether precious.  When he took it out he had intended to fling it from him into the very hottest part of the fire.  But he found now that he could not do so, not without a great struggle.  This is from the second chapter of The Fellowship of the Ring.  I found that the ring, in this case, represents sin.  And when we want to, or are told to, throw it away and never look at it again, we can't.  It's so hard, it's a struggle that will last for a long time.  And then when we do think about throwing it aside other people hear about our sins and they use it for 'evil'.  They'll spread it around and make it come back and haunt you until finally you give into temptation and fall back into the 'sin routine'.  I said the struggle will last for a long time, but it will not last forever.  Just as our young hobbit has come to find.    Scanning for more substance, Clint

        Fellowshipping with the Ring  I know I just wrote a movie review for The Return of the King, but I realized I liked writing a movie review so much that I'm writing one about The Fellowship of the Ring.  I stated in the last review how much I loved The Fellowship.  Allow me to restate it.  It was  awesome .   The film started off peaceful and happy, and as the movie progressed it slowly turned into something bigger than what the characters could handle, but there was no turning back.  The peacefulness that was at the begining brought you closer to the characters and made you actually care about them.  Then slowly as the danger increased so did your worry for them.  Any film that can capture the audience and make there heart pound as fast as the character's heart appears to be is a wonderful film.   This movie was also good because it introduced a new era in film making.  It has changed the way Hollywood looks at book-movies and has left an imprint on this generation.  The music is timed perfectly with this film.  Again back to the happiness in The Shire, the music is simple and comforting.  But when the enemy arrives it is hard, loud brass instruments that make you fear what lurks around the corner.  This film has shed a new light on filming making and script writing to me and I think it will have a lasting impact.  Please give feedback on what you thought of the film, and what I have said.  My Two Cents, Clint

       Free at last!  Finally, the week of torchure is over!  And I made a ninety-five on my algebra exam!  So happy to be out for Christmas and everything in between.  And so the movie saga begins.  As you can see from the sidebar I am already watching quite a few films.  I decided to go with The Fellowship of the Ring for reading because I only got two votes for the book, and I left that book at school on accident.  A new little category is on the sidebar as you can now see, 'Mom's Choice' will bring you information on the latest movies my mom has ordered from Netflix.com.  This is her only way to rent the cheesy and stupid movies that she wants to see because I do not permit them to be rented in front of me, so they arrive in the mail.  Anger Management was a terrible movie, I'm sorry if you liked it but I severely disapproved of it.  So naturally my mom ordered it!    Well, I'm going to go watch the Extended Edition of The Fellowship, and eat some Campbell's Soup.  Man it's great having no school.  Infinitly, Clint

       Hey you're special!  But not for that reason!   Um, what is it that makes people feel so special or overruling when they knew about something before it became big?  Seriously, I've gotten a lot of criticism before about doing something after it made hollywood (or whatever).  Like Lord of the Rings, I had no idea what it was before the movie, but now I like the books more...  Some people still argue about them knowing about it before I did.  Who gives a frick?!  I don't know maybe I'm just rambling.  Please comment on my rambling I'm feeling kind of lonely not having any comments lately, especially when I asked for advice from people I look up to and I still have no comments.

        The King has returned  As you know I saw The Lord of the Rings The Return of the King yesterday.  Before I get started on the review I want to point out, as Seth has, those who are so dedicated to these films and books please do NOT clap in the middle of the movie when it is most inappropriate.  Thank you.  Now to the movie!  I saw the first movie the weekend it premiered and fell in love with it, just as others have.  But unlike others I was able to contain my lust for the books and calm myself for the next movies.  And I was also able to find actual values in both the books and movies, unlike others.  The Fellowship of the Ring, in my mind's eye, was a beautifully, well put together film that was not credited enough come award time.  The Two Towers was not good as its predasesor because it seemed to me that they were aiming for more 'attraction' to the viewer by going into a love story that didn't exist in the book, and there was too much comedy.  Not good.  The Return of the King I found to be a beautiful movie that included enough story from the book to make it a good movie.  And they even left out a big chunk of it!  The war scenes were delicately coreographed with the computer animation, and the computer animation was even difficult to tell apart.  The music was timed perfectly with all the scenes which I was approve of greatly, because without music a film is cut at the knees.   Gollum's character is delivered so procisely perfect that even I was blown away.  The only thing I have to gripe about, is the prolonged scenes of standing on an edge and not making a desicion, and the slow motion happiness where everyone is smiling but it's slow motion.  Not good aspect to a film.  Other than that the film is now one of my favorites.  I hope you will witness the beauty soon.  New movie critic, Clint

      Well, quite a trick Amber Alwahab pulled today, quite a trick.  She said she would be arriving home for Christmas on the 19th...  Her birthday is the 18th and this pissed my mother off a good bit.  Well, when we arrive from The Lord of the Rings movie we see her car in the driveway and lo and behold she came home!  So now she's here and we are happy.  And hopefully tomorrow or Friday I will tell you what I thought of the 'Return' because it would take too long to do right now, and I have a sister to talk to.  Have a good one, don't forget to vote on the book, and pornography is now NOT a reader's selection.  Thank you.

       Straight Jacket of Consciousness   I could never think the way  urlLink Arley Hinson  thinks, and for that I am eternally envious.  As  urlLink D  put it: "Arley is one of the funniest, most insane, creative, and selfless people I know. Whatever you do, don't try to make too much sense of what she is saying, Arley has a unique style of being thought provoking and random at the same time and that's why i love her"    She is so random, but yet so thought provoking and lesson learning that it's amazing.  I only wish that one day I will be able to have at least a day in her mind.  I think I don't think like her because from 6th grade through the beginning of this year I have been striving for the 'perfection' that the media and the peers at my school want.  I think it began the first time the people in my class were having a party in 6th grade.  I saw the girl giving the kid across from me and invitation, and I thought alright I get one next...  She never gave me one.  And from then on up to 8th grade I was always tweaking my look and trying to look as 'cool' as possible, and so because of those long years of being conscious of everything I do, I turned into this weirdo that worries about everything he says, does, and gives the appearance of to others.  And I hate it, I'm trapped in this 'straight jacket' of consciousness and I'm no Houdini.  I don't want to be conscious, by conscious I mean aware of my imperfections and care about them, I want to be unconscious.  So hopefully through time and patience and a little help from those I look up to (Seth, Arley, Darren, Patty) I can unloose the straight jacket, and be myself.

       265 questions and I'm still standin'   Day One is over.  I was a little worried about my Wellness (aka P.E.) exam, but it turned out okay.  Geography, no worries, I've had a 97 all year.  Tomorrow, though, I have the feeling is going to be my D-Day.  I have Spanish 2 and science (just to brag: honors science) tomorrow, and it doesn't look pretty.  Spanish I know about 3/4 of it, but it's the listening and making up 27 sentences in spanish with different verbs and subjects that worries me.  And science...  Well Hitler is our teacher, so it doesn't look good at all.  I know the problems that we have to work out and stuff, but the vocab is the real blow to the crotch.  On top of that I have had a migrain since we started the first exam this morning, and I used up pretty much all my brain cells today.  Yet again the only thing getting me through this week is The Return of the King and I gots me a ticket.  (that could me two different things...  Church ministers I want a report on the two different meanings to that saying on my desk tomorrow morning!  Pronto!)        I better go.........  The Nazis are coming!  The Nazis are coming!

       A New Hope   Well, I finally got to analyze what happened yesterday and put it into words.  And I have to say it was a good experience.  I'm sure I have a lot of you on the edge of your seat dying to find out what happened.  And I'll tell you.  I went to jail.  Jay asked a few people to go and visit this guy and let him tell his story and what has happened to him.  So I went.  This guy's story is amazing, it took so much for him to see God right in front of his face.  But when he did see Him, he knew it was God.  And hopefully he will be able to get out of prison a little early, because he has shown that he has changed ways.  There was so much hope in this guy, and so much trust in God and he is just  a baby in Christ.  That's so amazing that he is putting all his trust in God and just waiting to get out.  The Chaplan asked him if he could sum it up in one sentence what would it be.  "Find God before He finds you." The inmate said.  And I think that's awesome because he learned that if God has to find you first, He's going to stick it to you and even send you to jail.    I just felt the need to share, give feedback if you please. Clint

      "exams suck. (but theoretically speaking, they dont actually suck, as it is more a force of being pushed in rather than sucked due to pascal's law, which states that the pressure of a fluid or final exam spreads evenly throughout the container or your mind proving that such highly influential test such as exams dont actually suck, but instead realy realy blow )"  Way to put it into words brad.

       Is anyone else constipated?   Sorry about the title...  I just felt randomness was nessecary.  And actually the only reason I am blogging today is because my dad is at the room in the inn program and my backpack is in the car.  DANGIT!  So until he arrives home, I can't study for the exam I am going to fail.  Oh well, it was a lost cause anyway.  I would blog about what happened today, but I would have to include names and I'd rather (was asked not to) not use names.   I will however rub it in that I got my Lord of the Rings ticket for Wednesday 4:00.  Other than that there isn't much to say, hopefully I will be able to live through tomorrow, blog you then.

       The awe of the Story  I was thinking about this today while Mike was talking. (it was hard to pay attention today)  I think it's really cool how one story (The story of Jesus) can effect the time of year.  I mean, December: Christmas, celebration of Christ's birth.  Easter: only a few months later, the Celebration/ kind of mourning of Christ's death.  I started to drift and wondered what it would be like if the Birth and the Death occured in the same month.  What if Jesus was born in June and died in June also...  Age differences of course, but what would that be like?  One week we would get a whole lotta presents, and then the next week the easter bunny gives chocolate!  What a mixed up society we would have...  December break would be Chonoka (sp?) break...  or Kwanza break... and summer break could be called Chreaster break!!!  From now on my summer break is called Chreaster break... and Christmas break.... well.....  it can stay Christmas break.  Oh yeah, I sincerely love the idea of  urlLink Seth  and his family's tree being a twig instead of the conventional tree...  Wish I had thought of that....  oh well....  Clint

          A Dark Era is Over   Well, after almost a year of searching and fighting for Saddam Hussein, he has finally been captured.   Found in a 'spider hole' on a farm in Adwar, Saddam gave up rather easily even though he was manned with two AK47's and another military weapon.  I'm sure you know the rest of the story but I wanted to share the good news and mark it on my blog.

         Creativity   Creativity has actually become a new vocabulary word to me believe it or not.  Ever since I began to read the book 'Orbiting the Giant Hairball' I have seen what I like to do (writing, drawing, photography) as 'creativity' not art.  Because creativity lives inside all of us, we just don't think it does because the way the picture looks in reality isn't what we had in mind.  You're not bad at drawing, you're awesome.  There is no bad, there is no good.  Because what truly comes down to good and bad is judging...  And judgment on the art piece isn't decided by just the outcome of the picture, but by what the judger thinks of the person.  You are creative only if you want to be, and I really and truly hope you want to be.    And that's that, Clint

      I have the feeling that this week will be one of the longest weeks of the school year.  The only thing that is giving some incintive to make it to Wednesday is The Return of the King.  I believe I'm purchasing the tickets tomorrow, Fandango style.  And then Thursday and Friday have their perks.  Only one exam Thursday because I have directed study for 3 hours allowing me to catch up on my studies that I missed on Wednesday, and Friday...  Well....  Friday is the glorious, holy matrimonial day that the dear sweet Lord granted we pathetic humans to indulge in.  And then after that it's Christmas!  Man these things sneak up on you!  November felt like two days long and then WHAM!  Merry Christmas, eat some cake!

       Arley Barley   urlLink Arley  seems to put everything in the right words.  Her latest blog is about her boyfriend, and that's what I've finally come to realize that I want........  a boyfriend? NO.  LOVE.  I want to be stupid with Her, not the her I have spoken of before, but Her.  The one that will be.  I want to goof off with Her and we both have fun.  I want to go crazy and drive off somewhere and we both have the time of our lives.  I want to be serious when we want to be and we both listen to one another.  I want to be able to draw something, and She not have one problem with how ugly the drawing is.  Or how ugly I am.  When shall this beauty reveal herself?  Only God will say, but I hope it's soon.  Arley you rock, Clint

       Scrutinizing my psyche  Today has been a whirl-wind of subconscious thinking and enlightenment to my brain.  (Thanks thesaurus.com)  I have been thinking about so much stuff unintentionally that if I blogged about it all, it would take a very long time to read all of it.  The stuff I have been thinking about has just come up in my brain and I started thinking about it, I didn't care, I just started talking.......  To myself.  Maybe over the next few days I will be able to inform you of my opinions on life, art, creativity, and individuality.  However for now, I am going to go take care of the crick in my neck.  And then sit down, try to study, lose my sanity in the studies and decide to draw or finish my book.  I would ask you to join me, but losing my sanity is kind of a one person thing.  Have you met Lisa my invisible girlfriend? Clint P.S. My replacement for the word obsessed: engrossed or captivated.

       At the epitome of age envy   I dislike age limits on concerts.   urlLink 3rd and Lindsley  had Jump Little Children perform live last night.  I desperately wanted to go and see them, but it was an 18 or older show.  This was also going to level out the playing field between my sister and I because she got to see them in Charleston.  And now the one time they have a band I want to see and it is general admission I can't go because it is on a Sunday.  DANGIT!  Sister Hazel cometh and Sister Hazel playeth, but Clint does not see-eth.  So I've decided that a boot legging of the concert is neccesary.  Don't worry,  urlLink Lightning 100  is playing them on the radio when they perform, so I will just push the record button and presto I have the concert.  That's pretty much the only upside to this story...  The major downfall is I have exams this week...  And I can't study because studying is impossible for me.  I can't just read a textbook and soak up all the knowledge, I have to interact I have to have something to relate it too, that's why math tests are usually pretty easy, cause I'm working the whole time......  Strange......  The calm before the Storm, Clint

       True Talent  A talent is not something that comes up to you one day and says hey I'm you talent.  You have to find it...  When you do find the talent, if you start to lose patience with it or leave it hanging, it's not your talent.  It's not your talent if your best friend can do it.  It's your best friend's talent, but not yours.  So once you find a talent, stick to it, and love it then it is your talent.  I like to think my talent is 'Creativity'.  It may not sound like a talent to you, but playing football isn't a talent to me, it's just running around carrying a pig to a piece of grass to me.    I just started typing whatever came to mind, and that's what it was.  I think I'm going to start doing that more often.  (typing whatever comes to mind)

      Well, I have been inspired by this book.  "Orbiting the Giant Hairball" by Gordon Mackenzie, it may sound like a strange book, but it is unargueably one of the best books a person could ever have the oppurtunity to read.   urlLink Seth  recommended it to me, and God bless him for all eternity for doing so.  If you are an artist or wish to be one, this IS the book to read.  Not reading it is NOT an option.  Now that the inspiration is in place, and the creative juices have begun to leak from the confines of my brain I believe some drawing is neccesary.  As well as some planning for artistic Christmas gifts.  Lift off in 10... 9... Clint

         For the love...  Just tell me!   Um, so I am suppose to have Great Expectations finished by....  right now.....  I have an essay due this Thursday on it, and I have only been able to read twenty pages of it because it is so insanely complicated, and the book was due back at the library today.  What I  did  read was pretty interesting I actually enjoyed the parts I read, but time was my limit...  Hints the weird Salvador Dali picture four entries down.  So if any of you have read this book, and would like to tell me how it goes and what happens BE MY GUEST.  I might try and read it again over Christmas vacation but I have other books on the list.    Of course, I just found out that my mom has owned the book this entire time, so I'm going to get a little bit more reading in before the report.  Oh well.  DANGIT, Clint

       Burger King Missionary.   After church on Sunday my father and I went a little money saver eating at Burger King.  We met a young girl that goes to Overton High by the name of Sajita.  She came over to my dad to talk to him because he spoke arabic to her when we made our order.  My dad tends to do that when he sees someone that is arabic.  It may sound rude or cheesey but the outcome was pheonominal.  We began to talk about Christianity and Islam, and my dad told his testimony in a short "summary" (if you will).  Sajita is muslim and we talked about our religion and she sounded VERY interested in our religion.  And as we got in the car after the very intriguing conversation, my dad said, "The only thing holding this girl back is her father.  If she didn't haven't her Muslim father there holding her back, she would come to the Lord in a heartbeat."  I thought that was so cool that we could witness to these people  at BURGER KING!  Dad's cool points went up by a billion, Clint

      If you strive for perfection you will get knocked down, but learning from the skid marks is the only way to know whether or not you're going to fall down again.   After what good ole Herby said on the comment button from the entry below, I came up with my own little quote.  I also thought up: Strive for perfection, but learn from the skid marks.  I'm not completely sure which one sounds better, but give me your thoughts.... please....

We should be so well balanced and symmetrical, that nothing which could ever happen could throw us off our center, so that no matter what misfortune should overtake us, there would still be a whole magnificent man or woman left after being stripped of everything else." - Orison Swett Marden

I'm sure a few of you have thought, oh he just hasn't changed it.  Trust me, it's there for a purpose.  All week I have been astounded at the sounds that can be put together by one man.  This is album is so amazingly fantastic that I now command you to purchase this CD immediatly.  It's somewhere around 15 dollars at The Family Christian Bookstore (for those who live in Tennessee).    Please buy it, Clint

       DeGoditizing in Progress.   I've been "deGoditized" by the corporate drones of America.  Big words I know.  Let me make it easy: the whole no Christmas or God in school is starting to take over...  Whenever I see anything to do with God in school, I think is that allowed?  Is that right?  Should that be allowed?  I'm really starting to get sick of it too.  Of course it's allowed!  But the America thinks it isn't.  Luckily I'm not restricted like our teachers, but it's really annoying me that they can't express their religion or even TALK about it!  Example: in our "candy room" at school the mothers of students work there.  And the other day as I purchased my candy, the mother that helped me slipped me a candy cane and said, "Merry Christmas".  The thing I should have done was say, "Thank you, merry Christmas to you too!"  but instead I was caught by surprise didn't know what to say and simply walked out THINKING, "Is she allowed to do that?"  Later I realized what I had said and got very mad at my very retarded and deGoditized brain.  Give feedback please, I want to know what you think.  Trying to be myself, Clint

As movie crazy as I am, I have not made a favorites list.  These are not in any particular order that woudl be too hard, so here goes:  The Lord of the Rings The Fellowship of the Ring The Sting (Robert Redford) Ocean's Eleven (2001) What Dreams May Come (Robin Williams) The Matrix Reloaded Jurassic Park  The Good the Bad the Ugly Pirates of the Caribbean The Right Stuff  The Count of Monte Cristo  There you have it, the top ten... for the time being...  no doubt that list will be changing very soon.

If you wish to see my photography and other projects I'm doing I'm going to start emailing them.  Pretty much every email address I have right are already on the list.  All you need to do to join is click the button on the sidebar entitled "Sign up here to see my photography" (something like that) and put your name in the title of the email and tell me that you wanna join, and you will soon recieve art, photography, and written pieces that I have done.  Sounds cheesey but I really want to show off my art work.  Being myself, Clint

       Myself...  At last.   I've finally found myself.  I'm that kid who stands in the corner when everyone is talking and doesn't care.  I'm the kid who makes friends with the kids that are like him...  They aren't cool because no one is "cool" because none of us really know what "cool" is.  I've finally found out what love is.  Love is two way.  Someone loves somebody, and that somebody loves them back.  And that someone and the somebody become love.  I've finally found out that money doesn't really matter.  You shouldn't decide your future and your job on how much money you will make.  You should decide what to do by what you WANT to do, but still be aware that the future is only told by God.  The picture under the words "Myself" describes me so much I think.  So the picture will stay, and so will I.  Finding Myself, Clint

       Did I just say that?   I was talking to my friend who is really down in the dumps right now.  She was explaining to me how she sees all her friends have "lovers" and how she wanted to be in love too.  And this actually came out of me...  I have no clue where but it happened, "but don't let love get in the way... trust me if you keep thinking that you need somebody to love... you're gonna die sad depressed and loverless... love doesn't just hit you... it comes when it comes... you can't look for love... it looks for you".

      "I think God made me the way he did because anything else just wouldn't suffice."                                                                          -Myself  		American Werewolves.  	Jack Bernhart sat in the back of his limousine in a car garage in west Chicago.  He was waiting for someone, an investor in his dot com business.  Jack saw a black Mercedes race up to the limousine.  James Calahan stepped out of the car and opened the door next to Bernhart.  Calahan sat opposite Jack with a look of sorrowful guilt.    	Calahan spoke first, "I want out Jack.  I've seen barely any production the last few months." 	"What the hell are you talking about?  We made over four million dollars last quarter." 	"Yeah, last quarter.  We're already half way through this quarter and we were lucky to make half a million,' Calahan replied quickly and defensively.   	"Jim you can't do this to me.  All the board member knew this would happen.  I mean Napster just came back for God’s sake.  Every teenager in the world downloaded from them," Bernhart began to sound frightened. 	"I will be turning in my resignation first thing tomorrow morning." Calahan got out of the limo and bent down and said, "Jack, I’m sorry." 	Bernhart shut the door with extra force almost clipping Calahan's nose.  He pushed the intercom above him and said, "Frank, take me home." 	Bernhart sat at the end of a long table in the center of the room.  Every chair on each side of Jack was filled by old, balding men with pens in their hands and a manila folder in front of them.  Except for one chair on Jack's right, it was unmanned. 	"Well, there's no avoiding this, gentlemen.  James Calahan turned in his resignation form this morning," Jack said hoping to move on without question. 	"Why?" asked a board member on Jack's left. 	"Well, he thought the business was going nowhere because of the latest production.  Of course we all knew that production would be a little slower, what with Napster and all." He said this with a slight laugh but it quickly trailed. 	Silence now swept the board room.  Bernhart looked around worried that others were thinking the same as Jim.  He quickly said, "I was looking at the latest re—"  	"I will-a resign too," a small Japanese man interrupted. 	"I'm sorry?" Jack said looking up from his paper. 	"Meesta Calahan was right, I want out too," the Japanese man said calmly. 	"Please Mr. Matsui, don't do anything rash." Jack pleaded. 	"Rash?  Rash?!" Mr. Matsui's voice was rising. 	Mr. Matsui got up quickly, collected all his things, and briskly walked out of the room shouting obscenities in Japanese.  Jack picked up the telephone and asked his assistant to stop Mr. Matsui.   	"Um, meeting adjourned," Bernhart told the members. 	Jack's assistant said she could not stop Mr. Matsui, and he had left.  Jack walked over to the large sign on the wall with the words, "Muse.com" and slammed his head against it many times. 			----------------------------------   	Jack arrived at work the next day to find that three more investors had resigned.  Panic was overcoming his entire body like cud zoo on a tree.  If anymore investors were lost his company would go under. 	The telephone on his desk screamed, interrupting the silence.  Jack picked up after the second ear-piercing ring. 	"Mr. Bernhart," a small voice sounded in the receiver. 	"Speaking," Jack said slowly. 	"I'm calling from Investors Bank of Chicago.  We would like to have a word with you as soon as possible.  Is there a specific time that would be okay sir?" asked the tiny voice. 	"Give me an hour," Bernhart said suspecting the worst. 	"All right sir, we'll see you in an hour," the voice said. 	Bernhart slowly placed the receiver down on its hook as he heard the dial tone sound.  He knew this wasn't good, the bank never called him.  In fact, he was lucky if he could reach them on the phone. 	Jack entered Investors Bank of Chicago one hour later, and was told by the receptionist to go to room B201.  Bernhart found the door in a long corridor of bland wooden doors.  B201 was special, however, it had the words CUSTOMER SERVICE AND TERMINATION written on the door. 			------------------------------ 	 	Jack rode back to his office in his limousine.  He was completely speechless, he looked as if his brain had been fried, and all he knew was to give a blank stare.  He was going to have to sell his house; he would have to buy a cheap used car.  He would have to tell the board members.  That was what scared him most.  He was going to stand before these money-hungry, blood-sucking, investors and tell them the company is bankrupt.   	Bernhart began to shake, and he couldn't stop.  This wasn't the kind of shaking like his AA days, he was having a seizure.  As he realized this, he had a sharp knife-like pain in his mouth, he had bitten his tongue.  He began to feel the blood running out of his mouth.  Then Bernhart started to see a white cloud cover his vision and he passed out. 			-------------------------------				                               Bernhart woke to the sound of a heart monitor beeping to the beat of his heart.  He had woken up earlier only to find that one board member remained on staff, and he had visited to say he was resigning also.  How could his life end up like this? 	Jack arrived home to find a stack of bills in the mail.  It seemed as if everyone in the world realized he owed them money and they wanted it now. Suicide was interrupting all his thoughts.  He couldn't finish a sentence without suicide creeping up.  The doctor said if he had not collapsed the way he did, he would have choked on his own blood.  He was beginning to wish he had fallen the other way. 	 	Suicide was inevitable now, it was all he could think about.  Bernhart went into the bathroom and began to run hot water in the bath tub.  He then walked to the kitchen and grabbed a cutting knife.  Jack stripped down to nothing; still holding the knife he entered the tub full of hot water.  Bernhart raised the knife to his left wrist, right as he pressed the blade to his skin the doorbell rang.     				Clint Alwahab	  That's my official first short story.  Hope you liked it, give me feedback on what you think.

        Nightswimming  Nightswimming deserves a quiet night. The photograph on the dashboard,  taken years ago, turned around backwards so the windshield shows. Every streetlight reveals the picture in reverse. Still, it's so much clearer. I forgot my shirt at the water's edge. The moon is low tonight.   Nightswimming  deserves a quiet night. I'm not sure all these people understand. It's not like years ago, The fear of getting caught, of recklessness and water. They cannot see me naked. These things, they go away, replaced by everyday.   Nightswimming,  remembering that night. September's coming soon. I'm pining for the moon. And what if there were two Side by side in orbit Around the fairest sun? That bright, tight forever drum could not describe  nightswimming.   You, I thought I knew you. You I cannot judge. You, I thought you knew me, this one laughing quietly  underneath my breath. Nightswimming.   The photograph reflects, every streetlight a reminder. Nightswimming deserves a quiet  night, deserves a quiet night.  I mentioned this song when I blogged about  A Rush... , allow me to rephrase: it's amazing.  I am learning it on piano at the moment, and it is so amazingly good, it's just a few lines of notes but it makes the song sooo awesome.  If you haven't picked up Automatic for the People or The Best of R.E.M. now is the time to do so, and go straight to  Nightswimming  when you get it.  If you don't cry when you hear it you obviously do not have a soul.

      Finally reality hit me today.  I don't want to actually pay money to just keep a website up.  Unless it is for my job, which I don't have, or I am getting payed to pay for it, which I am not.  So the url voting is now obsolete.  Sorry.....

       High Fidelity  Lately I have become more interested in non-fictional stories by down to earth writers who know what the ugly high school was like.  So from the recent hails of grattitude from Seth Worley, I have decided to read High Fidelity.  After this I will be viewing the film....  I'm not very far into it, but I already enjoy his writing and his outlook on the topic: sex and dating.  I will update you on what I think of it as I progress through it.

      If you do not have something productive or intellegent to say on the comment button, do not say it.  There are some people out there that have different opinions than I do, they read this blog evidentally, and post comments that are neither beneficial to their opinion nor to the world.  So I will repeat: If you have nothing good to say, don't say it.

      Okay, well here's the deal everyone.  I have found another online company worthy enough to replace the blogspot blog.  Once I conjur up the money I will be purchasing a domain without a .blogspot or a .whatever...  So what I need you, the reader, to decide is the name.  Here's what we got so far, and if any of you Matt Genitempo and friends comment I will hunt down your family and slaughter them in the night:  thelavalamp.com pinklavalamp.com [or other cool color] thepinkrobot.com pinkrobot.com clintoniousproductions.com themindofanamericanpsycho.com monarchy.com americanmonarch.com waitingtobetamed.com wordsofinsanity.com americanwerewolf.com  That's all I have for now, if you have a suggestion please say it, but say which one you like of this group as well.  Keep in my mind the page will still say Clintonious Productions, this is simply the url.  P.S. I will be adding more as time passes by.

       Corny Thought? Probably...  But Cool?  Definitly  I'm really enjoying the recent sermons that Mike Glenn, BBC pastor, has been giving.  I'm so glad we are getting serious with the sermons and addressing specific issues.  A few weeks ago he talked about worship.  Jay, our youth minister, also talked about worshipping that same day.  One thing that stuck in my mind was what Jay said.  He said that worship is whatever you want to make it, and that there are different forms of worship.  I like that because I am re-assured that when my ADHD kicks in during worship, it's okay because I can worship the way I want later on.  I can come home and start drawing on my dry erase board and if I put my heart in it, I can give it to God.  I could go out and shoot (photographs) for two hours and worship the whole time, and the pictures could be a form of worship too.  Rather corny blog I know, but this is kind of a lift me off into 'serious blogging' mode.  If you want the silly, crazy side of Clint Alwahab there is a way to get your fix.  I have an 'e-blog', I made it up myself actually.  I started it before I knew how to reduce picture size and before I knew AOL was a server.  I send my digital photographs pretty much weekly, sometimes more, and you get to know how it was made, what it means to me, and you get to listen to me make stupid jokes.  What more could you ask for?  You can sign up by clicking in the 'links' section under 'blogs', 'E-Blog Sign Up'.  Simply put your name as the subject of the e-mail, tell me you would like to be put on the list and sha-bham! you're in.  (Yeah, I used the word sha-bham, sorry.)

         A Few Steps Further  I've decided not to blog...  as much.  Due to the fact that I am a selfish, unfunny blogger.  I think after a certain amount of blogging you get very self-righteous about yourself and get away from blogging about the important stuff.  The important stuff is what I really want to blog about.  The solution: don't blog so much, and if I do, I will treat it like an exam essay.  From now on I am going to write my blog entries on paper first, just as I am doing now, and then blog it.  I will still add some comedic blog entries but not as often.  In all seriousness, I have come to a big decision in my life.  (Hard to believe a fifteen year-old is having to make life decisions I know but...)  I have two paths to choose from, I can not go into detail about one of the paths becuase it is an extremely bad one that I have been walking down a long long time, the other is my 'faith walk'.  And so, in beefing up the blog and making it sensical I will hopefully move a few steps further along the path I chose.  I will try to bring you thoughts from: my bible study, movies, books, music, and even my own thoughts.  So, the serious side of Clint Alwahab steps up to the plate...  I hope.

       Reminiscence of Happiness, then Brought Back to Reality.   Well today wasn't all that great of a day.  I know, we got out of school early and I could be in English right now, but I don't care.  I am grateful to be out but it's not like my day has been deemed the most wonderful day of the year or anything.  No today is bad because of two things.   1.  I don't have any good films to view and I can not go see Lost in Translation because a woman takes off her clothes in it.  (My mom is okay with rated R violence but even little sex jokes are unforgivable. Granted this is somewhat worse, but I have seen boobs before, it's not like they are foreign to me.)   2.  My flower has died.  That picture is a picture of this flower that I found in my yard the other day.  It stood out so much among the dead/somewhat living grass that was swarming it's distinctive colors so I took a picture of it.  I thought it was so amazing that in the cold, drizzly January this little flower found life and brought warmth to the area.  This will sound extremely corny, but when I look at this picture I can actually feel spring, I can see the trees warm and vibrant and my dog chasing rabbits in our backyard.  So I came to really liking this flower, and as I saw the large snow flakes fall outside my third period science class I thought about this little flower.  I arrived home and found it dead, rinkled and shriveled into a blackened yellow spot among the frozen white and dead green.  So that was my day, and plus the classes I did manage to go to, gave homework.  Ah well, at least I've got.........  I don't even know.  Something else that I have felt since the end of school yesterday: I want to be free, I'm already sick of high school and I have 3 more years ahead.  I want to get a job right out of high school that will involve my talents and my abilities, go to night classes at Watkins and actually have three hours in my day where I can sit at a desk and think of what to write, or draw, or photograph next.  I want those three hours to be silent, no sound of parents listening to everything I do, asking what I'm doing, asking if I have finished my homework, no sound of the television blasting because my dad is in hearing impaired denial, no sound of a nasty baked chicken and white rice with green beans dinner cooking,  Nothing .  I want to be able to sit down and just sit there without having to worry about this homework that makes no sense to me whatsoever, I want to be able to go out and take pictures without a time limit, I don't want to be confined to an office cubicle and have to type meaningless crap into a computer for $5.50 an hour.  Does anyone have a thought or advice that I can use?

        Finally! a  good  mystery/cop film  First I would like to address the comments issue.  I'm not sure if there is some kind of mess up and my lovely readers can not see the comment button, but believe me, it's there.  And it is waiting for some intellegence, even useless comedy at this moment.  I really wanted feedback on the last two posts.  And I'm actually starting to get pissed off, shame on me for doing so but I am.  Okay, moving on.  I finally saw  Mystic River  this afternoon.  I had planned on going on the weekend but my throat was a red apple.  I went with my mom, yes my mom, and we both agreed it was very good.  I was told by some it was a wait-for-DVD film.  I didn't think so, I like mystery/cop movies, and this was both.  The only mystery/cop fix that I get now-a-days is from Law and Order and I'm really getting sick of it.  That show now basically consists of corny one-liners that aren't even delivered well, and pompus suspects that always have there lawyer so they can't ask questions, which gives them the one hour time slot.  But I also love story plots involving the mafia or a mafia type group and cast members who actually look like they are in the mafia (Sean Penn).  Clint Eastwood did a surprisingly good job of directing, I'm glad he actually approached this with cinematography in mind as well as the story.  The cast was, of course, very good too with actors such as: Laurence Fishbourn, Kevin Bacon, Tim Robbins, Sean Penn, and that lady that was in that other movie.  I can't remember her name......  Anyways, I highly recommend it, go see it in theaters while you can, but if you can't make it by then it's okay the DVD is coming soon.  If someone doesn't comment I'm gonna blow something up.  Like your head.

         Well, I have finally created two  Clintonious Productions  logos.  I have yet to make a film, but I consider my artwork a 'Clintonious Production'.  A website for Clintonious Productions will hopefully be up soon, I have to find the money in order to establish the domain registration and monthly fee, right now I have eight bucks.  Don't count on the website being here soon, but once it is up believe you me, you will know.  Enjoy the pictures.

         Talking and Walking  [Helicopter has just crashed into a building, Neo has saved Trinity and Morpheous] Morpheous: Do you believe it now Trinity?  Neo: Morpheous, the Oracle...  She told me--  Morpheous: She told you exactly what you needed to hear, that's all.  Neo sooner or later you are going to realize, just as I did, there is a difference between knowing the path, and walking it.  I love this excerpt from The Matrix.  It gets the point across that you can change fate and make the decisions for yourself.  I don't believe in fate, the only 'fate' that I believe in would have to be God, because He still has final judgement.  But you still make decisions, you can plan out your life and think ahead all you want but when you end up facing the problem you can still decide which way to go.  I'm not sure this completely made since, mainly because it is the second time I have had to type it because my internet is stupid.  But please tell me what you think, I tried to start conversations on the last two entries and you guys did a great job of talking back.  That was sarcasm to extremeties by the way.

      Well, my plans to see the encore presentation of  Mystic River  could not hold, due to the fact that my voice sounds like I have been chain-smoking for the past thirty years.  I was really anticipating this film because I love Sean Penn and it's directing by a guy named Clint, what more can you ask?  So now I will sit at home, read, watch movies, and blog.  A lot of entries will probably come out today, so bear with me, hopefully not all of them will be completely unnessecary.

       Deja Vu Tormenting  Have you ever had one of those days where it seems like you've seen it before?  Deja vu has been tormenting me all day.  Quite a few times today during school I stopped and said, 'wait I've been here before'.  The scene was set-up just how I had seen it before.  But I couldn't remember where or when I saw this.  Maybe in a dream, maybe a friend told me, maybe I'm just crazy.  But today has been weird so I shall sleep now, and maybe tomorrow will not haunt me like today.

      I just finished Out of Time, and I have to say it was pleasently good.  I didn't think it would be that great because of the Denzel Washington factor but it turned out to be a good flick.  It's a good mystery/don't know what's next kind of films.  I would recommend it to anyone who has patience and doesn't get annoyed by high tension.

      I hate the feeling of having to be included in something when it is truly none of your bussiness.  I felt like that a lot today and I hate it when I do that, because I make cheap and redundant efforts to try and get myself involved.  Then I feel as if I am annoying everyone in the room with my attempts to be 'in on it'.  Those are the times when I want to go home and do stuff on my own just so I can go to the person the next day and say, 'Look what  I  did.'  Then I realize how even more annoying that could be, and  then  I really hate myself for being such a nomadic retard.  (Nomadic was most likely not the best word use, but that was the first thing that came to my mind...)

       Girl Dies After Possible Exorcism  By HARRY R. WEBER, AP  ATLANTA (Jan. 20) - A husband and wife have been charged with murdering a 6-year-old girl whose back was broken in what police said may have been an exorcism gone wrong.  The couple was arrested Monday after being spotted on the street naked in the freezing cold along with two other children.     Police said the dead girl, whose body was discovered in a motel room, had been strangled and stabbed, and her back was broken. An autopsy was planned.  Based on what the adults told authorities, investigators believe ''they were involved possibly in a ritual of some sort,'' police spokesman John Quigley said. ''It may have had something to do with undemonizing the child in some manner.''  Christopher Carey, 29, and Valerie Carey, 27, were charged with murder late Monday, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported in Tuesday editions. They initially were charged with cruelty to children, public indecency and obstruction of police and were taken to a psychiatric ward. They were later moved to a jail.  Police learned of the death around 12:30 a.m. when the unidentified man and woman were seen walking naked down a city street with two children, a 2-year-old boy and a 7-year-old girl, Quigley said.  The 7-year-old provided investigators with information that led them to the motel, where they found the girl's body.  The two adults had apparently been living there for some time, possibly through assistance from a church, Quigley said.   01/20/04 11:32 EST   Found this interesting....

       You said I'm gonna buy this place and burn it down, I'm gonna put it six feet underground, You said I'm gonna buy this place and watch it fall, Stand here beside me baby in the crumbling walls,  Oh I'm gonna buy this place and start a fire, Stand here until I fill all your hearts desires, Because I'm gonna buy this place and see it burn, And do back the things it did to you in return  You said I'm gonna buy a gun and start a war, If you can tell me something worth fighting for, Oh and I'm gonna buy this place is what I said, Blame it upon a rush of blood to the head  Honey, all the movements you're starting to make, See me crumble and fall on my face, And I know the mistakes that I've made, See it all disappear without a trace, And they call as they beckon you on, They say start as you need to go on, Start as you need to go on, Start as you need to go on    Said I'm gonna buy this place and see it go, Stand here beside me baby, watch the orange glow, Some'll laugh and some just sit and cry, You just sit down there and you wonder why,  So I'm gonna buy a gun and start a war, If you can tell me something worth fighting for, I'm gonna buy this place is what I said, Blame it upon a rush of blood to the head, Oh to the head  Coz' honey, all the movements you're starting to make, See me crumble and fall on my face, And I know the mistakes that I've made, See it all disappear without a trace, And they call as they beckon you on, They say start as you need to go on, As you need to go on As you need to go on  So meet me by the bridge, Meet me by the lane, When am I gonna see that pretty face again, Oh meet me on the road, Meet me where I said, Blame it all upon a rush of blood to the head   This song is absolutely my favorite song of all time, Nightswimming is right up there with it.  Tell me what you think of it, do you like it?  do you hate it? did you actually read it?

       What are you thinking?  I'm seriously learning stuff from this Sunday school class that I don't think they were aiming for, but it's still good stuff.  A lot people (guys) don't think like I do.  Let me explain: today one of the things in Charlie's (our sunday school teach) handbook was about the Rolling Stone issue about the greatest 500 albums of all time.  (Strange? yes)  The question was what would you're favorite album of all time be and why?  I never really found out the point to this question because of the respsonse to what I said.  I initially said Coldplay Live 2003, Charlie nagged at me because it just came out and that couldn't possibly be my favorite.  So I wimped out and restated my answer.  I said Goodbye Yellow Brick Road by Elton John and Abbey Road by The Beatles.  The second is so cliche it hurts I know, but I had too.  But everyone, even Charlie mind you, died out laughing at my response.  Why?  Because I said one of my favorite albums of all time was by a homosexual.  And in a judgemental chorus they all reigned upon me with statements like, 'He's gay!' and 'Dude....'.  I was pretty much ready to clock everyone of them in the face at that point.  Course I later thought about this and realized how much bullshit homosexuals have to go through.  (Pardon my French)  I mean if they could get that much judgement from a friggin' church group think what the streets of New York or even Nashville are like.  You know there are sometimes when I love the world and other times when I just look at it and say what are you talking about?!

       In America   I called  urlLink Seth  today and asked if he wanted to go see a movie, agreeing on terms of it not being R we decided it was either Along Came Polly or In America.   urlLink Arley  and Katy came along too, they were the initial deciders, and luckily they chose In America.  I did not really want to see Along Came Polly because I wanted to see something serious, and it looks retarded.  So we saw In America.  We weren't completely sure of the plot and I'm sure you are not either.  So I'll give you the run down: an Irish family moves to New York City, they live in a crappy and dangerous apartment complex.  Luckily they meet an incredibly cool person that is an artist and adds serious cool art to the movie.  You watch the failures and succeses of this family through the eyes of one of the two little girls and her 'camcorder'.  I would have to give this film two thumbs up, there were only a few times I was confused but they made since in the end or I was just stupid enough to actually be confused.  I think the Green Hills Cinema is the only place playing it so hurry hurry hurry!

        urlLink Jet  made their debut into society with the recent release of  Get Born .  Get Born is a mix of old rock and new lyrics.  The guitar solos are amzingly good, and the vocals are even cooler.  What has given them their claim to fame that will cause them to be remembered for a long time is the song 'Are You Gonna be My Girl'.  The song was first played on the iPod commercial with the dancing people and then they did studio performances with AOL and The OC played them not too long ago.  If you have not picked up this album I would highly recommend it, I didn't think it would be that good, but it is very well done for an indie band's first album.  It's only eight bucks at Wal*Mart ;).

      Here a good topic that I blogged about a long long time ago in a galaxy right here.  It was on the topic of judging, keep in mind this is a true story.  Monday, October 27, 2003   Interesting... Very interesting.  I meant to talk about this yesterday, but I didn't. In Sunday school we were talking about judging others, and how we should just except them for who they are. I know it's cheesey but the outcome was interesting. One of the kids said look at David  Privacy Edit ! It's kind of hard to be nice to him. Now David was not in the class, but his friend was. And a few of the kids continued about how he wears eye liner and wears his sisters gym shorts. Granted a little weird but... The friend raised his hand and said that David just doesn't like to be judged and he's really not weird he's a cool guy. And then suddenly the air changed completely, the room was filled with, "Yeah he's a cool guy, yeah." I thought to myself, wow this is depressing. We automatically think that the person isn't around so we can talk about them, but we never think about who else is around us and if they might be hurt. It wasn't David who was hurt, it was his friend. And most likely his friend told David that they were talking about him, and now David probably won't return... Sorry I'm just a little teed about that.  Pondering about human habits, Clint   Seth Worley made a great comment   man, that is something to be teed about. most christians in a youth sunday school class are usually both "all theory and no action" (love and preach verbally ONLY) and "conformist to the max" (one minute wearing abercrombie the next minute calling it preppie). actually, you'll find that some people don't ever leave that end of the pool. just preach with your self, man. Seth  I think for quite sometime I was in the conformist category.  But I've made it past that (I think) and started to be who I am, but staying on the side lines so that when instances like what happened in Sunday school come along, I won't be involved and end up screwing things up.   P.S. I have not seen David at Sunday school ever since.

      Why does it have be this way?  Why does life have to be this  complicated .  Why is it that out of all happiness there has to come pain?  Even at the happiest times, pain has to creep up.  It doesn't say anything until the happiness has died down.  Then it pounces and makes you feel like such a terrible piece of flesh.  Tonight we had a surprise birthday party, and after everything was said and done.  The pain (a person) came up and revealed the problem.  Making me feel terrible.  Why does it have to be this way?

       Today's been rough  I hate appearances.  I hate having to worry about what my shirt says or what my shoes look like.  I hate that I still have this reaction of judging, I've grown with it so much that I do it without even thinking.  And then I tell others not to judge, but then I turn around and do the same thing.  I hate having to worry about what others will think of me.  I hate not being able to sit at a table of all girls at lunch and not worry about what others are saying.  I hate the feeling of 'all eyes are on me'.  I hate being so self-concious about my appearance...  Today's been rough.

      Well, after much deliberation I have come to a conclusion.  I can not pick just one favorite movie of all time.  So here are the ones I chose: The Sting, Jurassic Park, and Big Fish.  The Sting because it is the greatest con movie of all time and it was probably the first good one.  Jurassic Park because I grew up with it and have loved dinosaurs ever since.  And Big Fish because it has lit a new candle for me in the cinemagraphic/ good writing/directing department.  Tell me what you think.

       I wrote a letter to all the birds of the world today:  Dear Bird(s),  I envy you for all the typical reasons.  You fly about the skies without a care in the world.  Though you are not the smartest creatures on earth, I find that to be an advantage.  You do not have the worry of hatred that the world's people produce so well.  Instead, you fly around a big blue air bubble and dive for worms and fish.  I find flying to be the absolute most beautiful and graceful action the Lord bestowed upon the earth.  Thank you dear birds for being who you are, and reading my letter.  Sincerely, Clint Alwahab

       The Latest Rolling Stone  You may have noticed that my description says, 'Picking up the latest rolling stone'.  I revised my own entry about the latest issue from Rolling Stone, and realized the poetic sense in that phrase.  I'm picking up the latest rolling stone and stopping it from getting away.  Away from somewhere bad?  Or away from somewhere good?  Only the stone would know by continuing its roll.  But if I was to let it roll and it roll into the bad, what would I do with myself?  I would have let this stone, this 'lost soul' roll away into darkness.  Though I cannot fully comprehend what I have just said because it is late and I have another head ache I want to point that out.  Perhaps you can translate my babblings and put them into lamen's terms.

       Me, really?  I find it hard to believe that people actually appreciate me for my 'talents' or 'gifts'.  I put those words in parenthases because I do not like to think that I have talents because then I become too confindent of myself and too much self-confindence (in my mind) can kill you.  But I still find it weird that people would like what I say and actually  talk  about me.  I've never really been accepted like that, and if I have been talked about, it's not good.  So I think it's a little weird that people see value in me, because I...  Don't.  I mean I do see value in myself but not enough to be considered cool, or 'a good guy', or even 'normal'.  Although I do not believe in normalcy and acceptance, I think it's wrong to consider someone 'not normal' when we truly do not know what normal is.  But it's still heart warming to know that somewhere out there in the cold world that will eat you alive, I am looked at with appreciation.

      I don't usually get into football games so much as to where I am screaming and yelling and talking to the players on a first-name basis while sitting at home.  Don't get me wrong I love the game, but I don't see how people can be so concerned about something so trivial and, in the grand scheme, not important.  My dad yells like a maniac at the T.V. and it actually annoys me, I don't know why.  He yells at the screen as if he is talking to Steve McNair calling him 'Mac'.  And he talks with disappointment about all these other coaches that have 'foul mouths' and when the game comes around he uses equivalents to those same words.  My father is a hypocrite when it comes to matters such as these.  And that kind of ruins the game for me.  So tonight was not a very enjoyable night, please by all means give opinions if you feel the urge.

       Quite enjoyable, but I say nothing  I saw Big Fish today.  I won't give a review because I don't want my stupid opinion to interfere with your viewing of the movie and you like it but be held back by my judgements.  So I will say that I need to see it again.  Not because it was confusing, well...  To me the movie was confusing, but only because nothing has stuck in my head this week, my brain is completely gone.  A combination of many things led up to the destruction of my brain, but that would take to long to go into and hey I don't have the brain to talk about it.  And plus I have decided that I will no longer think about movies until I have seen them.  I anticipate movies way too much.  Lately the films I have gone to see haven't lived up to my great expectations and I have been let down.  So no longer will I anticipate a movie.

      I started to think about time during fourth period Spanish today.  I thought about how long we think a week is and how bored we get in just one hour and then I thought about how long a year can take and how much longer I have until I get out of hell (Ravenwood High).  I went even further into my mind and began to block everything around me out and just kept thinking.  I don't neccesarily remember all the things that went through my head but there were some strange thoughts.  I then realized my physical location and went slowly back into the everyday routine of life.  Man when does spring break get here?

      Sorry I didn't blog yesterday, I didn't really have anything that wasn't entirely selfish or about me so I didn't blog.  Today however I picked up the latest Rolling Stone at the 'mafia run' Publix.(Did I tell you I think Publix is run by the mafia?)  There are some very good articles in it, the main is about Dave Matthews, and good side articles about Toby Keith, the Bushes, and some cursed island.  Pick it up if you get the chance.  I'll go into detail about the mafia and Publix thing another time.

      Well, with the begining of the third nine weeks of my freshman year comes assignments.  And my English teacher has given the oppurtunity once again for free writing extra credit.  American Werewolves was used for extra credit in that class, you can read it in either the month of November or October (can't remember).  Anyways, I just wanted to let you know that I'm starting on another free write short story, the final draft is due in March and I believe I will wait to show the blogger world and give the final.  Cause the American Werewolves that was published on this blog was not the final.  If you have any starting ideas or random words that I can start something off of I will dry erase board it and see what happens.  Oh yeah, my infamously cool directed study teacher is no longer my teacher, the prinicipals redid all the schedules due to complaints of no work being done in the classes.  I think we were the cause for that, because we watched movies, threw bouncy balls around and did other stuff I don't want to say cause I think Mrs. Gregg reads this.  Be the miracle people.

      Well my hunt for the basic black Chuck Taylors was unsuccesful.  I went to Show Carnival where my friend found hers and the only size they had was the gigantor 11.5.  DSW wasn't helpful either, all they had were navy ones.  I was just looking for the basic black to start off my Chuck Taylor shoes wearing.  I was however succesful in finding a nice dry erase board and every color of dry erase marker imaginable.  If you wish to see what it looked like go to seth's blog and look at the pictures in his entry about Re:Volt.  I have the same one.  Do any of my fellow Nashvillians know where to find some good Chuck Taylors?  Please help!

         Enhance creative thinking.   Well this Monday I will be ordering this giant dry erase board for my bedroom.  Why you ask?  I've found this year during school and at church that everyone needs a dry erase board, preferably extremely big (classroom big).  During directed study at school my teacher allows me to (thankfully) draw on the boards and just do whatever on them.  And when Wednesday nights at BBC still existed  urlLink Arley Barley  and I would draw and/or write totally random stuff.  And I found that doing this helped express emotions and just get all those creative extras that don't look good on paper out of your head and make room for more creative thinking.  And plus if you screw up, all you have to do is swipe it off with a rag or heck even your head and it's gone.  I'm ordering it Monday because I don't like ordering on the weekends because businesses only ship on weekdays and it seems longer if you order it on a weekend.  Maybe sometime in the near future I can share some of my 'Dry Erase Insights'.  Be the miracle, watch the Titans.

Man I was hoping for at least one more album from them.  I really am going to miss this gifted band that saw music in a totally different light.  If you have not heard of them, go out and buy one of their albums you will not regret it.

       I've got to say, these dreadlocks that I plan on getting had better be worth the wait.  I have to grow my hair out to rather long extents considering I have curly hair.  I at least need to get it down to my chin and right now my bangs are about half-way past my eye-balls.  Now don't think that my hair is looking shaggy or anything, no no.  Remember my hair is very curly so it all scrunges up on my head to look like a loofah.  But my problem is when I sleep the hair on my sides and back of my head get very very flat and the hair on top of my head stays the same.  So I look like a flash back to the comedian Sim-bad's glorious days.  Does anyone have a solution?  I don't think there is one other than keep taking showers.  P.S. I pulled a Seth and explored the google image data base by typing in curly hair, and this is what I found.

        I’ve seen the silence grow between us And not to make this sound so hard But all my troubles and my justice fades on such cold steel I made up that story to change your mind I could have been somebody else But now I’m me this time.  Slowly but surely I have come to realize that this describes me so perfectly since I've 'gotten over' the girl I used to like.  I used to put on a show, and try to show her stuff to impress her (What guy doesn't do that) and I wouldn't really be myself around her.  Now I can truly say that I am myself around her and that I do not like her.  Thanks Pete Yorn.

      Well my dad just got off the phone with our family in Iraq.  This is big news because we have tried for a very long time to connect with them and have been unsuccesful (phone wise).  Maybe this is a sign of the new year, perhaps the war in Iraq will go faster (unlike what I said in my predictions).  And maybe we can even go over there...  Not this year but in the years to come.

       What does the crystal ball say?  Okay so I have a few predictions for this new year, and here they are: Coldplay's new album will sell like crazy and I will most likely not get it in time unless I keep up with the website.  The Music world will be pretty good all together, movies will seem so much better this year than last year's downfall, and many good movies will premier despite the end of two of the biggest sagas of our generation.  The war in Iraq will move along, but most likely not faster.  If Bush does not end the war and improve the economy (or improve the economy while the war goes on) he will most likely not be re-elected.  Pete Yorn will come to Nashville and I will not miss him this time, James Taylor will come to Nashville and I will not miss him, and Dave Matthews will come to Nashville and I will probably consider going but decide I don't want to.    Those are my predictions and if you read this far, I'm proud of you.

      "What Gibson has provided for me, for the first time in my life, is a visceral idea of what the Passion consisted of. That his film is superficial in terms of the surrounding message -- that we get only a few passing references to the teachings of Jesus -- is, I suppose, not the point." -From Roger Ebert's review of  The Passion of the Christ .

        What I thought of  The Passion   There are not many words to describe how good of a film this is, although, I am not completely turning my life around because of it.  The story was very accurate to the Scripture, some quotes were given to other characters but that is not something that would bother me.  I read a few reviews on  urlLink Rotten Tomatoes  before I began this entry, one disapproving reviewer said:  It's as if Gibson is measuring God's love by the amount of blood he shows on the screen.    My reply to this comment would have to be: First, this only covers the last twelve hours of Christ's life.  The only thing really left in those twelve hours  is  bloodshed.  Second, wouldn't you consider someone that shed that much blood to be a loving person?  Honestly, how many of your friends have suffered and died like that for you?  If at all?  Another reviewer:  If Jesus actually received the amount of punishment dished out in this film, he would have been dead three times over before arriving at Calvary.   My dad actually mentioned this as we rode home, he said that if He was any other man He would have died before the twentieth lashing.  I almost said, 'But He went on because He knew this [the crucifixion] had to happen'.  (But I didn't say anything.)  So I tell you now, put all your media speculation and your doubt behind you and actually go see this film.  Not because everyone is talking about it, or because you are a Christian (meaning you have to see it); rather: see it with a ready heart and mind, and see it because  you  want to, not because I just told you.   Don't read this if you have  not  seen the film  The ending was without a doubt one of the best endings to a movie, ever.  Instead of continuing on with the story and going into the resurrection and the doubt of Thomas, the Stone was simply rolled away, Jesus's clothes collapsed on the cold stone, and Jesus walked out.  And as He walked out you got a quick glimpse of his hand and the hole that was left from the nail.  Why is this the best ending of all time?  Because the non-believers of the audience that have never heard the story will say, 'Wait, what happens next?'  And that's when they can explore the bible and hopefully come to know God.  And for the believers out there that  do  know the story, the film can still mean a lot to them.  P.S. I did not weep during this movie, the only time tears were brought to my eyes was afterwards when I realized how real, and accurate this portrayal was. P.S.S. Please do not think me as another one of those Christians who will watch this film, be 'in God' for a month and then be back to my same old self.  This movie did affect me, but not to the extent of not knowing how typical I could sound. (Did that make sense?)

       This one's for you Megan    Well today was a very good day.  When I arrived home from a very nice car ride, I got outside and started shooting up the place...  Pictures, that is.  Megan Greene has been pushing me lately to take more pictures and to let her see them.  Well Megan there is a lot more of where these two pictures came from.  (don't forget the new pictures in the corners.)  I went outside, and as most of you know I live in the middle of the woods so I have the world at my trigger finger.  A long  long  time ago this guy that use to live in a shack close to our backyard showed me this spring about three minutes from my house.  With the weather raining down joy and happiness I went there first, a long the way I took lots of pictures and then took a few at the actual spring.  The one at the top is my dog getting out of the spring, and the one below is the paw print he left behind when he was shaking off the water onto me.  Hope you enjoy.

       My Preaching Moment  Gerry House, the ultimate morning radio show host, made a great point today.  He said that he had read a letter to the editor in The Tennessean, our Nashville newspaper, that said that all the homosexuals should just be sent to Massachusetts so they can get married and live there.  As you probably know this really pissed me off because I hate discrimination like that.  As the hour progressed he talked about how the lottery people are really starting to annoy him.  And then he said, 'I think we should just ship them all off to Tunica so they can live out their lives there'.  At first I found this funny because he tends to randomly say things, but he continued on this rant throughout the news and what-not and I realized what he was trying to do.  He was making the point that people are supporting the lottery and it's not 'immoral' like homosexuality is, but the gays should still be shipped off like the Jews in the Halocaust!  Finally a moron called in and said, 'Gerry you are kind of sounding hypocritical when you say that sending the gays to Mass. is wrong but sending gamblers to Tunica is right.'  Gerry replied, 'Well that's my opinion and I'm entitled to it.'  The guy hung up and I desperately wanted to go up to that guy and tell him how much of a fool he made himself sound.    This is a big moment in 'Hypocritical Movements'.  (As I like to call it.)  People that found the Janet Jackson 'Half-boob' Show (get it?) offensive are still sitting around watching television shows such as: Will and Grace, Scrubs, The OC, Friends, and even ER.  (Now don't get me wrong, not everyone that found the boob offensive are still or never were watching these shows)  Just those few shows are enough to make Jesus go ape on your butt!  But people still watch them...  As Mike Glenn, BBC pastor, pointed out by asking the congregation one Sunday, 'How many of you bought lottery tickets?'.  Wow I was seriously waiting for half of the congregation to sink in their pews.  That is such a great point, you say stuff about morals, but then you turn around and do just the equivalent of those actions.  And last time I checked, every sin is the same as the other (correct me if I'm wrong), so what is the difference between conducting in homosexual acts and gambling?  Or cursing and murder?  Sure to us those sound totally different.  Why do they sound different?  I'll tell you: because our country is driven by sex.  (Again not saying  everyone  is, but the majority of our country is.)  Gambling: isn't bad, it's just a little fun, cursing: eh that's nothin' everybody does it.  But murder: whoa buddy that's pushin' it.  You see what I'm finally trying to say is, we aren't running on God's morals...  We are running on  our  morals.  I hope that all of this has made since because it is a  very  serious issue with our humanity at this time, and I hope we can do something about it.  (Please don't ridicule me in the future when I talk about a Friends episode or a movie, because that is a terribly bad arguement and we are all, and always be, like that.)

        Im gonna fight em off A seven nation army couldnt hold me back Theyre gonna rip it off Taking their time right behind my back And Im talking to myself at night  Because I cant forget Back and forth through my mind Behind a cigarette And the message coming from my eyes Says leave it alone Dont want to hear about it Every single ones got a story to tell Everyone knows about it From the Queen of England to the hounds of hell And if I catch it coming back my way Im gonna serve it to you And that aint what you want to hear, But thats what Ill do And the feeling coming from my bones Says find a home Im going to Wichita Far from this opera for evermore Im gonna work the straw Make the sweat drip out of every pore And Im bleeding, and Im bleeding, and Im bleeding Right before the lord All the words are gonna bleed from me and I will think No more And the stains coming from my blood  Tell me go back home  This is another one of my favorite songs.  It's one of my favorites not just because of the bass line and incredible drums, but because it is so extremely poetic.  I love the way it gives you different aspects, example: He's not just smoking a cigarette, he's 'behind a cigarette'.  That's just extremely cool to me...  not that he is smoking but the way it is worded...

      Sometimes I really hate having to make decisions. I know, I know: decisions are a part of life... But sometimes I just wish I was commanded to do something, so the big sissy that I am doesn't show up for the vote.... Damnit. I guess I should listen to this unknown wiseman:  "Good decisions come from experience, and experience comes from bad decisions."   -Unknown

      It's that time of day. Everything you have ever heard, thought, saw, and breathed in is creaking in the attic. Ready to strike when you aren't looking. Waiting for you to turn your back, then it takes your courage. Every little sound is an escaped convict. Every shadow a monster teasing your mind. The dog barks with panic, the gate squeaks in the wind, and the fear is out tonight. Running from home to home to torment the little children who hoped to stay up just a few more hours but now regret their foolish wishes.  And for me, it's worse...  Because no one can hear me scream.

      It's a bitter sweet symphony. More to the mind than the body. More to the body than the mind. Lives, living out their lives of life loving lives. Go home and sit before a sheet of paper. Write out your life, How you want it, How it will be, How it won't be. The message from my mind says leave it alone. And I'm bleeding, All the words are going to bleed from me and I will think no more.  (I just ripped this out of my mind, somewhat from music that I am searching around for right now...  If it doesn't make sense, forgive me I speak weird stuff late at night.)

      'I think owning your burden is half the battle.'  -JD from  Scrubs   In this scene he is talking about guest star Michael J. Fox's OCD problem and the three guys (JD being one of them) trying to deal with their problems.  Fox's character has shown up and taken the hostpital by storm and out done the three doctors.  One by one they all come to him to tell them how they feel, JD found Fox first washing his hands hours after a surgery that he had performed.  Then JD finally realized that everyone has problems (Even the biggest hot shots around) and that dealing with them is something we all have to do.  This is a little corny but I always seem to find some hidden meaning among the inuendos on  Scrubs , and I thought I would share.

      I was just sitting here, browsing the blogger community and rested my head on my jacket sleeve.  I then smelt something rather interesting...  I continued the trail and discovered the smell was Caramel Macchiato from Starbucks which I had spilled on my sleeve a good two weeks ago, now I am craving some coffee from Starbucks...  God bless that coffee shop.

      I'm not going to go in depth about the Grammys, mainly because I don't want you to fall asleep.  As  urlLink Seth  said, the only reason to watch the grammys was for The White Stripes and The Black Eyed Peas.  I only agree with half of this however.  I thought The White Stripes did a fanominal job, Jack White knows how to rock the house and how to dress like Harley Quinn.  However, I despise The Black Eyed Peas, I really do not like them.  Sure they sing about how America is hurt and down and not doing good.  But I'm sorry, I've heard these type of statements all the time, about how these people (not to be stereotypical) grew up in the Bronx and they know what the hard life is like.  They said the CIA were terrorists in the song!  (Correct me if I am wrong)  Seth, I'm sorry buddy but I did not like The Peas's performance, nor the Justin Timberlake performance with an entire choir for back up singers.  The performances I did enjoy were: The White Stripes, Beyonce (Because she is extremely beautiful), Sara McClaughclin (sp?), Outkast (both performances), George Clinton, Robert Randolph and the Family Band, and the Beatles tribute with Dave Matthews (forget Vince and Sting).  But the one I most enjoyed was the one that almost brought tears: the tribute to Warren Zevon.  I love that song and Warren, and that really made my day.  A quick 'shout-out': I've been asked many times by this young (haha) lady since she learned of my blog, to be mentioned on it.  Eve Sarret you rock the house, long live the Eve.

      Top five things that are bothering the crap out of me at the moment:  (I am in no-way looking for pity, I just want to see if others are bothered by these things, or agree...)   1.  Musical incompetence-  People who are so devoted to rap and synthesized music that they find songs such as Bitter Sweet Symphony 'gay' or 'retarded'.  2.  Microsoft Word screwing up and closing out without saving my writings which I was working on, and are not recoverable.  3.  Rolling Stone's complete anti-Bush bashing.  4.  Keyboards contributing to number two.  5.  Annonymous commenting- whether mean or helpful, it's just plain annoying.

      There is something reassuring and self-satisfieing about re-wiring your computer.  I don't know why but for some reason, I feel better, maybe even cleaner, now that I have re-wired and re-arranged my Dell desktop computer...  But in the process of hooking up the wires it felt weird because I had no access whatsoever to the outside at that moment in time.  I was just a guy at his house in the middle of the woods, drilling a hole in a cabinet to make more room for his computer.  I wasn't Writersblock612@aol.com, I wasn't the founder of Complicated Simplicity or American Monarch, and I definitly wasn't some online junkie...  It was kind of weird...  And then I turned it back on and felt better....

       October Football and Vanilla Coke  Have you ever listened to a song and are suddenly brought back to a time from your past?  I'm listening to the Red Hot Chili Peppers's  By the Way  album at the moment and I have suddenly been lurched back to an October Friday night at a Ravenwood High football game.  I had listened to this album so much that I actually became sick of it, but at this moment in time I was still obsessed with it and had every song stuck in my head, all playing at the same time.  This is such a weird feeling, my thoughts, opinions, and even lusts have changed since then.  I'm brought back to new friendships that went down the hole a few weeks later, and times of sucky directed studies, and vanilla coke.  Vanilla Coke?  Yeah well, you see our high school's football jerseys are the exact colors of Vanilla Coke, so it is now a permenant memory, strange but true.  And now the song is over, another track is bringing other memories not as clear as the last, so I'm going to go find a different album because this one is freakin' me out.  Google search for: 'Vanilla Coke'

        So, One Time, in Mexico..  I just finished  Once Upon a Time in Mexico , and I know I say this about all movies but it was very good.  Though I've never seen  Desperado  nor  El Mariachi  I felt like I knew what was going on because they managed to explain everything in the two hour span.  Antonio Banderas delivered excellently and, of course, made me feel like pumping iron.  Johnny Depp, without a doubt, out did himself with this film.  His wit and his extreme coolness was so present in this movie I wanted to become a CIA agent.  Although Salma Hayek did not have a big role in this film she still proved herself a great actress and that she is way past her  Austin Powers  days.  The other cast members such as Cheech Marin, Willam Dafoe, and that other guy were tramendous and only added to this film.  If you have not seen it yet, go to blockbuster, get it, pop some popcorn (kettle corn if you're weird) and sit back and enjoy.  Tell me what you thought of it if you saw it.

       Rainbow? Yes. Purple? Yes. Girlfriend? No.  I think I'm starting to give the appearance of a homosexual.  Seriously, I think people at school think I am gay.  The reasons, of course, are trivial and stupid reasons but I think they still kind of get a message across, that I don't want going across.  Example 1(Stupid reason, but people think it): The fact that I wear purple shirts a lot, and wear a  rainbow  WWJD bracelet.  Yeah, I know what you are saying, it's a frickin' WWJD bracelet, some how the people manage to ignore that completely and still find the words to say to me that it is a rainbow bracelet.  The purple shirt thing is another stupid attempt to criticize gays, I've been told hey you are wearing a purple shirt...  I say, yep...  And then they walk away thinking to themselves the words they weren't willing to say.  I know that's judging and I have no evidence that they were thinking that, but come on people, you've heard that purple was the 'gay color' since 3rd grade, or at least since the telletubbies went national.  Example 2:  A few girls at school are trying to hook me up with this girl, whom I have never met by the way, and I have told them ever since they started up that I don't care and I do not want a girlfriend.  They have questioned me, why not?  I say, I simply just don't want one at the moment.  Especially when I am a freshman, 'cause they (girlfriends) are still in that state of "call every twenty minutes to see 'what's up' and sit there for another twenty in silence on the phone".  Example 3: I'm a paranoid loser who worries about his image all the time and think I am giving off that appearance of a homosexual, which I hope I am not.....  Am I?

Am I ever not just some freshman who doesn't know what he's talking about? Will anyone  ever  hear me out?

        I waited and waited and waited for God. At last He looked, finally He listened. He lifted me out of the ditch, pulled me from deep mud. He stood me up on a solid rock to make sure I wouldn't slip. He taught me how to sing the latest God-song, a praise-song to our God. More and more people are seeing this: they enter the mystery, abandoning themselves to God.  Psalms 40:1-3

       As I sit here eating my Goldfish and sipping on an orange flavored Capri Sun I wonder how some peoples' minds really and truly work.  I wonder if they are just putting on a show or if the little gerbil running the wheel really talks like that. Here's why I wonder this: Now that spring has sprung and the ground is showing signs of life, and rabbits are  really  showing life, a good three-fourths of the school body (at any school) starts to procrastinate to new levels and disobey rules.  Dr. Pam Vaden (Dr. meaning Darth) has learned this from past experience and has wisely re-enforced the rules to stricter limits.  Well that three-fourths of the student body that had been bending the rules all year now are beginning to be angered because they are no longer aloud to leave the classroom.  So of course, a lot of these people have decided to 'protest' these 'new rules' by leaving first period and joining in the gymnasium of life (I call it that) to 'rebel'.  When I first heard this 'brilliant' plan I thought: that's just great, my first period class  is  gym.  So I've got a front row seat to the very first Ravenwood Uprising.  In directed study, however, some of the people planning The Apocalypse began taunt our teacher by asking the idiotic question: What would you do if we all just got up and left right now?  For some reason students think that if you rebel in large numbers they won't have to face the consequences; they see a Haitian rebellion and think 'Yeah, that should work'.  I tuned out before I heard my teacher's response because I knew the 'rebels' would continue their argument.    So by the end of school I am preparing myself for The Next Morning, actually excited about this beyond stupid idea.  But of course, rumors don't travel far without a rat, and Darth found out.  She made 'an address to the Nation' through the intercom and informed all rebels and miscreants that their extracurricular activity rights would be evoked, including prom which just so happens to be this weekend, and In School Suspicion will be forced upon all seen there.  No doubt as I left my seventh period class I still heard the die-hard patriots saying they would still be attending The Apocalypse.  I'll be looking for them tomorrow morning :)

      Well it's official my mom has no taste in movies whatsoever.  I was browsing through her  urlLink Netflix  status queue and found: The Sum of All Fears, Gone in 60 Seconds, Under the Tuscan Sun, and What a Girl Wants.  It gets worse my friends: Uptown Girls, Secondhand Lions, Radio, and The In-Laws!  A lot of the other ones are old classic movies that are so lulling I consider movie time at home my nap time.  The only good stuff that is on there is The Office and Almost Famous.  I forced her to put The Office on there because the list was so depressing.  Hopefully soon I can clean up the list and get the good stuff on there...  Things like Daddy and Them have got to go.

Only until one knows what it really is should it be used.

       The Why's of the Week   Well it has been a long and boring week and the weekend hasn't improved it whatsoever.  Why?  Because ever since I have heard of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind I have been exceptionally excited about it.  But of course, it's rated R...  Seems that every quality movie out there now-a-days is R.  I'm starting to lose hope and interest in films because of this.  So here are reviews of the past week and a half of things I have viewed, listened to, and read.  Please try and put up with it as long as possible.   Why Norah's new album is good     Norah Jones, as you probably know, released her second album only a few weeks ago.  I purchased it last week and began listening to it profusely.  Like The Empire Strikes Back this album has made such a comeback it should be recorded in time.  Well, maybe it's not  that  good, but still worth an hour of your time.  I would give it four out of five stars.   Why  Lost in Translation  is so freakin' good     Lost in Translation was released in the fall and was not very well heard of.  I actually like it that way.  The first opinion I heard was that of my former directed study teacher saying it was, ' very  good'.  So over time I heard a little bit more of the film, though not a lot.  It left theatres for a while and then returned for an encore.   urlLink Seth Worley  viewed it then giving it the highest of praises.  By now I knew I had to see this no matter the FCC's restrictions.  So finally after months of convencing and sweet talking my mom ordered it off of  urlLink Netflix  and we watched it.  I hadn't realized that it was just two people hanging out, but once I reviewed it and watched it a second time, I realized how good of a film it was and great the writing was.  If you haven't watched it yet, I highly recommend it.  Five out of five stars.   Why  Slaughterhouse-Five  is strangely great     Kurt Vonnegut's controversal story of the Dresden bombing and the adventures of one 'time-traveling' man is now one of my favorites.  This book is nothing like I have ever read before.  It oddly provocative but still well written.  He tells the story of a man named Billy Pilgrim, who, supposedly, can travel through time and see his life in the future and sometimes of the past.  Among the places we visit in his time travels is Dresden which was the scene for a massive American bombing in World War 2.  Billy Pilgrim also believes (no one else does) he was abducted by Tralfamadorians, natives of the planet Tralfamadore, where he was put on display in a zoo and 'mated' with a famous movie star.  The story continues on weaving in and out of time travels, leaving you in complete vertigo of his location at the end of the book.  Even through all the confusion Vonnegut is still able to deliver a great moral message.  If you enjoy reading and have a strong stomach I would recommend this to you.  Five out of Five stars.  So that's that...  Hope you enjoyed all my nonsence.

      Once again I am making my feeble attempts to reach a creative genius point.  I'm starting the 'E-Blog' back up again.  If you don't know what this is, I'll tell you: A long long time ago I started a newsletter that featured a picture of my doing.  I wanted to get my art out to the world and be noticed.  If you would like to recieve these photographs you can start by emailing me at: Clintoniousss@aol.com....  That is Clintonious with three S's.  The only requirements I have are that you put Sign Me Up as the subject, and that in the e-mail you state your   REAL   name.  None of that anonymous crap, if you give me an anonymous name you will be exiled and stoned.  P.S. I'm considering changing my blog name, approval?

       Foolish Fear   It's that time of day. Everything you have ever heard, Saw, Thought, And breathed in is creaking in the attic. Ready to strike when you aren't looking. Waiting for you to turn your back, Then It takes your courage. Every little sound is an escaped convict. Every shadow, a monster teasing your mind. The dog barks with panic, The gate squeaks in terror, And  Fear  is out tonight. Running from home to home to torment little children who hoped to stay up just a few more hours, But now regret their foolish wishes.  But with the subtle awakening of morn  Fear  is no longer a quandary. The panicked souls of night no longer have to fear the night before. The only fear they have is the  Fear  of tonight.

      I wish I had the time, capacity, and friends to make a film.  It doesn't even have to be a huge production, even a music video would be fine.

      Don't you just love the mediocre attempts  Hanson  makes to get air time on the radio again?  Now their hair doesn't match (Last time they were all short, before: all long), one of them is married, and the little brother has hit puberty...  'Bout dang time...  Who knows maybe they have a better shot now that they have help from  O.C.  star Samaire Armstrong...  But who knows, maybe that won't help at all seeing as they suck.......

         What's a blog without another movie review?  These movies are good because the Wachowski brothers knew what they were doing.  If they were written or directed by anyone else they would be just more corny movies shown on the Sci-Fi channel at two in the morning.  But the Wachowskis knew what they wanted and they made it happen.  The writing is phenomenal, amongst the mind blowing action scenes, characters are developed and become either friend or foe.  The Wachowskis didn't just concern themselves with the script in front of them, they kept the next movie in mind making sure they linked logically.  I think these films wouldn't be that great if they had just been written by one Wachowski, together they were able to collaborate and decide what should and shouldn't be in the film.  The directing couldn't be done by anyone else, period.  They invented a totally new screenshot (camera panning around the entire scene) and were able to pull off some of the biggest stunts Hollywood has ever seen, both real and CGI.  The brothers were able to communicate with their actors and their crew and were able to produce a masterpiece.  Character development was actually a big part to these films, I thought.  My favorite character is without a doubt: Morpheus.   He has such strong faith in Neo that he should be an example to us all.  Not to believe in a guy called Neo, but believe in God and have complete faith in Him and do whatever it takes to make him first priority.  He gives up everything for Neo, and even risks his own neck (in every film).  Plus, he gots da moves.......  yo...  He's just a cool character that Laurence Fishbourne pulled off wonderfully.  To top off this masterpiece of a trilogy, all three films have wonderful hidden messages we all could use.  I found the most substance in The Matrix Reloaded, one of the messages I found is right below this entry.  There are so many hidden messages I can't go through them all, but I can give a couple.   Kid: I want to join the Nebuchadnezzar. I know Morpheus hasn't filled the other crew positions except for you, Link. I'm sure he has his reasons, but the more I think about it, the more I think it's meant to be. You know, it's fate. I mean, you're the reason I'm here, Neo. Neo: I told you, Kid, you found me, I didn't find you. Kid: I know, but you got me out! You saved me! Neo: You saved yourself. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Smith: I killed you, Mister Anderson, I watched you die... With a certain satisfaction, I might add, and then something happened. Something that I knew was impossible, but it happened anyway. You destroyed me, Mister Anderson. Afterward, I knew the rules, I understood what I was supposed to do but I didn't. I couldn't. I was compelled to stay, compelled to disobey. And now here I stand because of you, Mister Anderson, because of you I'm no longer an agent of the system, because of you I've changed - I'm unplugged - a new man, so to speak, like you, apparently free. Neo: Congratulations. Smith: Thank you. But as you well know, appearances can be deceiving, which brings me back to the reason why we're here. We're not here because we're free, we're here because we're not free. There's no escaping reason, no denying purpose - because as we both know, without purpose, we would not exist. Smith 2: It is purpose that created us, Smith 3: Purpose that connects us, Smith 4: Purpose that pulls us, Smith 5: That guides us, Smith 6: That drives us, Smith 7: It is purpose that defines, Smith 8: Purpose that binds us.  Smith: We're here because of you, Mister Anderson, we're here to take from you what you tried to take from us. Purpose.   And finally, these movies are just plain awesome...  Tell me what you think.

        Morpheus: Commander, we need a presence inside the Matrix to await contact from the Oracle. Lock: I don't want to hear that shit! I don't care about Oracles or prophecies or Messiahs. I care about one thing: stopping that army from destroying this city, and to do that I need soldiers to obey my orders. Morpheus: With all due respect, Commander, there is only one way to save our city. Lock: How? Morpheus: Neo. Lock: Goddamnit, Morpheus! Not everyone believes what you believe! Morpheus: My beliefs do not require them to.  I love this film so much.  It has so many hidden meanings, Jay just needs to play it for Lifegroups one night.

       Solsbury Hill  Climbing up on Solsbury Hill I could see the city light Wind was blowing, time stood still Eagle flew out of the night He was something to observe Came in close, I heard a voice Standing stretching every nerve Had to listen had no choice I did not believe the information [I] just had to trust imagination My heart going boom boom boom "Son," he said "Grab your things, I've come to take you home."  To keepin' silence I resigned My friends would think I was a nut Turning water into wine Open doors would soon be shut So I went from day to day Tho' my life was in a rut "Till I thought of what I'd say Which connection I should cut I was feeling part of the scenery I walked right out of the machinery My heart going boom boom boom "Hey" he said "Grab your things I've come to take you home."    When illusion spin her net I'm never where I want to be And liberty she pirouette When I think that I am free Watched by empty silhouettes Who close their eyes but still can see No on taught them etiquette I will show another me Today I don't need a replacement I'll tell them what the smile on my face meant My heart going boom boom boom "Hey" I said "You can keep my things, they've come to take me home."

         Note: You may not want to read this if you have not seen this film, or found it offensive or dirty, because I loved it.  This movie is another great love story.  I've become kind of mushy for love stories...  But hey, it's still very good.  Cameron Crowe did a fantastic job of writing this screenplay, he truly captured what it is like to love, to hate, and to be utterly confused.  Penelope Cruz plays Sofia Serrena, an intellegent, beautiful woman whom Tom Cruise's character, David Aames, falls head over heels for.  The only problem is David has another lover, whom he can not get rid of.  Julie Gianni is a somewhat desperate/insane woman who will not leave David because she believes she and David are soul mates.  Julie finally comes to suspect something between David and Sofia...  So what does she do?  She does what every desperate lover does, she drives her car off a bridge with David and herself inside.  Julie dies and David is finally free from her insanity, and he and Sofia can be together without any worries.  Or can they?   Love  is so well captured in this film it hurts.  It's not just the fact that the characters are in love, but  you  are in love with the characters.  Penelope Cruz is now one of my favorite actresses because of her performance in this film.  She is so amazing, her character is almost too good to be true, so you really start to feel like David Aames feels...  You can't get enough of her.   Hate , oh man, the hate you have towards Julie Gianni (Cameron Diaz) is so strong you want to shoot your television.  She always shows up right when you don't want her to, she's like Janice from Friends, she's the recurring person you want to see least, only she is twenty times more dillusional.  She shows up and all hell breaks loose, mainly because it seems impossible because she is dead...  But she's still there, David can't get away from her.  He can run as far as he possibly can, and she'll still be there, that's why you hate her so much.    'What the heck is going on?'  is the number one question I asked myself during this movie.  How can Julie show up here?  But how, she's dead?  What does that mean?  I thought they were there?  Who's that guy?  Which one is Sofia and which one is Julie?!  were just a few others.  My favorite scene of both confusion, and hatred is near the end, David and Sofia are 'makin babies' and suddenly Sofia turns into Julie!  David has no clue how but she did, and he continues to make love to her but he is screaming with anger and trying to figure out what is going on, while Julie is having the best time of her life.  (The music totally completes this scene, it's Todd Rundgren's  Can We Still be Friends? .  Listen to it and you'll understand.  It makes the scene humorous at first and then deadly.)  Finally David grabs a pillow and smothers Julie, he's going to get rid of her once and for all...  But once she stops moving, he discovers the mole between her breasts that belonged to Sofia.  He doesn't even move the pillow away, he just runs...  He runs away.  This scene combines everything, it brings love, utter confusion, hate, and even fear to the table.  It may sound really dirty, but it is one of the best love stories I have ever watched.  Please tell me what you thought, did you like it, did you find it dirty and offensive, do you find me dirty and offensive?  Comment it.

       Well, the North Poll is working rather nicely, but I am regreting putting 'Random Crap' as one of the options because it is number one so far...  But I don't think I have everyone's opinion on this thing...  So to make it fair, I'm giving you a little taste of all your options.  Here is a story I once posted on my blog, but it was a rough and it was pretty bad...  This is it finished and turned in for extra credit...  It's not very good...  Please vote once, I know if you vote twice.   American Werewolves.   Jack Bernhart sat in the back of his limousine in a car garage in west Chicago.  He was waiting for someone, an investor in his dot com business.  Jack saw a black Mercedes race up to the limousine.  James Calahan stepped out of the car and opened the door next to Bernhart.  Calahan sat opposite Jack with a look of sorrowful guilt.   Calahan spoke first, 'I want out, Jack.  I've seen barely any production the last few months.' 'What the hell are you talking about?  We made over four million dollars last quarter.' 'Yeah, last quarter.  We're already six weeks through this quarter, and we were lucky to make half a million,' Calahan replied quickly and defensively.   'Jim, you can't do this to me.  All the board members knew this would happen.  I mean Napster just came back for God's sake.  Every teenager in the world downloaded from them,' Bernhart began to sound frightened. 'I will be turning in my resignation first thing tomorrow morning.' Calahan got out of the limo, bent down and said, 'Jack, I'm sorry.' Bernhart shut the door with extra force, almost clipping Calahan's nose.  He pushed the intercom above him and said, 'Frank, take me home.' Bernhart sat at the end of a long table in the center of the room.  Every chair on either side of Jack was filled by old, balding men with pens in their hands and a manila folder in front of them, except for one chair on Jack's right, it was left empty. 'Well, there's no avoiding this, gentlemen.  James Calahan turned in his resignation this morning,' Jack said, hoping to move on without question. 'Why?' asked a board member on Jack's left. 'Well, he thought the business was going nowhere because of the latest production figures.  Of course, we all knew that production would be a little slower, what with Napster and all.' He said this with a slight laugh, but it quickly trailed. Silence now swept the board room.  Bernhart looked around worried that others were thinking the same as Jim.  He quickly said, 'I was looking at the latest re-'  'I will-a resign too,' a small Japanese man interrupted. 'I'm sorry?' Jack said looking up from his paper. 'Meesta Calahan was right, I want out too,' the Japanese man said calmly. 'Please Mr. Matsui, don't do anything rash.' Jack pleaded. 'Rash?  Rash?!' Mr. Matsui's voice was rising. Mr. Matsui got up quickly, collected all his things, and briskly walked out of the room shouting obscenities in Japanese.  Jack picked up the telephone and asked his assistant to stop Mr. Matsui.   'Um, meeting adjourned,' Bernhart told the members. Jack's assistant said she could not stop Mr. Matsui, and he had left.  Jack walked over to the large sign on the wall with the words, 'Muse.com' and slammed his head against it many times. 			----------------------------------  Jack arrived at work the next day to find that three more investors had resigned.  Panic was overcoming his entire body like kudzu on a tree.  If anymore investors were lost his company would go under. The telephone on his desk screamed, interrupting the silence.  Jack picked up after the second ring. 'Mr. Bernhart,' a small voice sounded in the receiver. 'Speaking,' Jack said slowly. 'I'm calling from Investors Bank of Chicago.  We would like to have a word with you as soon as possible.  Is there a specific time that would be okay sir?' asked the tiny voice. 'Give me an hour,' Bernhart said suspecting the worst. 'All right, sir, we'll see you in an hour,' the voice said. Bernhart slowly placed the receiver down on its hook as he heard the dial tone sound.  He knew this wasn't good, the bank never called him.  In fact, he was lucky if he could reach them on the phone. Jack entered Investors Bank of Chicago one hour later, and was told by the receptionist to go to room B201.  Bernhart found the door in a long corridor of bland wooden doors.  B201 was special, however, it had the words CUSTOMER SERVICES written on the door. 			------------------------------	 Jack rode back to his office in his limousine.  He was completely speechless, he looked as if his brain had been fried, and all he knew was to give a blank stare.  He was going to have to sell his house; he would have to buy a cheap used car.  He would have to tell the board members.  That was what scared him most.  He was going to stand before these money-hungry, blood-sucking, investors and tell them the company was bankrupt.    Bernhart began to shake, and he couldn't stop.  This wasn't the kind of shaking like his AA days; he was having a seizure.  As he realized this, he had a sharp knife-like pain in his mouth, he had bitten his tongue.  He began to feel the blood running out of his mouth.  Then Bernhart started to see nothing but a white cloud, and he passed out. 			-------------------------------				 Bernhart woke to the sound of a monitor beeping to the beat of his heart.  He had woken up earlier only to find that one board member remained on staff, and he had visited to say he was resigning also.  How could his life end up like this?  Jack arrived home to find a stack of bills in the mail.  It seemed as if everyone in the world realized he owed them money and they wanted it now. The reaper was interrupting all his thoughts.  He couldn't finish a sentence without suicide slowly creeping up.  The doctor said if he had not collapsed the way he did, he would have choked on his own blood.  He was beginning to wish he had fallen the other way. 	 Escape was inevitable now, it was all he could think about.  Bernhart went into the bathroom and began to run hot water in the bath tub.  He then walked to the kitchen and grabbed a cutting knife.  Jack stripped down to nothing; still holding the knife he entered the tub full of hot water.  Bernhart raised the knife to his left wrist.  Right as he pressed the blade to his skin, the doorbell rang.

        Solsbury Hill     With every drawing there is a story; and I love drawing, and I love telling stories.  A long time ago I drew the picture on the left one sunday morning right before church service.  I declared it to be a volcano exlpoding over two cities, and the eye represents evil.  (I like abstract art)  So I went for a few weeks with that drawing, all alone without a mate on righty (the right shoe).  So then today I finally decided to give lefty a righty...  The shoe on the right is a picture of the same volcano after the explosion, everything is calm a peaceful, even the cities lie happily in peace.  The sun is rising and shining onto the peace and making everything new again.  It was later on today that I began to realize how phylisophical this was.  I came up with the phrase:  Out of all bad things comes good .  I began to really like this phrase because I have been needing this sort of spiritual boost at this point in my life because of troubles that have been plaguing me.  So I began saying it over and over.  And eventually I drew something for this story (other than the shoe pictures).     This is a 'chinese' symbol I uh...  Made up...  It means that very phrase.  A few hours ago I came to realize that the lines are in exact quantity to the words in my phrase...  The three top lines are: Out of all...  The line right below the third line is 'bad', the line connected to it is 'things'.  Connected to 'things' is 'comes' and at the bottom is 'good'.  This phrase is desperately helping me through my struggles right now.  Pretty cool that phylosophy and spiritual strength can come from a picture you didn't even know you were drawing when you did it.   I'm going to conjur up a story to go with the pictures; fictional, of course, just for kicks.  The title of this entry is called Salsbury Hill, because that is the name of the volcano and it is my favorite song by Peter Gabriel.  The symbol is now embedded in sharpie on my left, lower wrist.  I have affectionately named the symbol  Mae Tao .  Please enjoy the photographs, and look for a story soon enough.

        I had a dream last night...  What's weird is, I've never had a dream like this before, I think I actually learned something from this dream, almost like in the bible whenever someone had a dream, it actually benefited to their life.  You know?  Finding love has become another rising issue with me, so I actually dreamed about love...  Let me explain:  I don't necessarily remember how this dream began, because it's not as clear as some dreams, but there was a girl... duh...  And it was a girl that in real life annoys the living piss out of me, but in this dream I started to have a normal conversation with her and got to know her a little better.  I don't remember what we talked about or that kind of stuff, but the thing that my mind was able to remember was me talking to myself...  I was watching her talking to other people and just being herself, and I remember thinking to myself, 'My God, she is beautiful...' and something to that extent...  But what's weird is I was thinking this, and the fact that others didn't think she was pretty or smart didn't matter to me...  She was beautiful because of her personality...  This is going to sound stupid, and mushy, and cheesy, but I think I'm actually beginning to understand what a real love is...  I think this dream has helped me discern love from lust quite a bit...  Vanilla Sky really helped me to understand this dream too...  If you've seen Vanilla Sky I think you might understand what I mean.

        In this film we are taken through Joel Barish's memories of his former girlfriend Clementine.  He is having these memories erased from his mind because he is so broken hearted.  Once Joel begins the erasing he visits every single memory he ever had of Clementine, he sees the good memories and the bad ones.  Soon, as Joel begins to see more and more good memories he begins to realize he doesn't want them to go, and that he still needs Clementine.  As I have said before this film is beautiful...  In every aspect.  The characters are so in depth and down to earth.  You get to know the characters so well, and as time goes on you begin to love them so much you also feel like Joel, you don't want the memories to go.  Love for a character is vital in writing and screening a film and Eternal Sunshine mastered that.  The cinematography is so bloody brilliant, it blows my mind away.  As Joel and Clem run from the eraser they hide in old memories or already deleted memories.  When they are hiding in deleted memories the only light is that of the camera, it's the only guiding light.  When hiding in old memories, we visit Joel's past and see him as a baby, a toddler, and even a teenager.  It's so amazing how the different aspects and opinions of the younger Joels are delivered.  Jim Carrey once again did a perfect performance, but the acting I found best in was Elijah Wood and Kate Winslet.  Kate played Clem and did a spectacular job of delivering her character and really making you like her, she was funny, and serious, and beautiful, and annoying, and everything a real person is.  Elijah did a great job too; he really captured the creepy guy you don't like but still feel bad for.  And surprisingly, Kirsten Dunst did a good job too.  I wasn't expecting much from her, but she wasn't half bad.  All in all, this movie is my number one favorite movie of all time...  As of now.  Five out of five stars.

       New Stuff Galore  Well, I sat down today at the computer to just do a few things and ended up changing a lot around and sitting at the computer longer than neccesary.  If you will be so kind as to look around at my hard work.  North Poll:  A new polling system I have set up, will most likely be updated every week or so.  New pictures:  Check the corners.  A Search Engine:  I put up a little search button thing, but I don't think it works.  In the Spotlight:  A new thing at the very bottom of the page, it will have different websites most likely every month.  New Productions label, and links set up better:  Just check the sidebar.

      Instruments I would currently like to learn how to play: Banjo Harmonica Guitar Steel Drums Piano  I also want to learn how to read music, and then write music and perform in front of some form of an audience, whether it be at school or church...  That is my big dream as of now.  Oh and I want to be able to train my voice so I can sing.

      Well with spring break comes a natural bending of the rules.  As you can imagine I have done so.  I finally saw Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind tonight, and I loved it.  Every aspect of it was amazing.  I love that it was dark and only the camera's flashlight showed a path when they were running from the eraser.  I love the characters, I love the story, I love the cinematography.  I loved everything.  Witness it now.

      Well I am now sitting at my sister's computer in Charleston, South Carolina.  It is disturbingly quiet because Amber is taking a 'nap' (at 9:30 at night) and her roommates are studying.  So I'm getting the full of affect of college...  I guess...  I finally had buffalo wings for the first time in my life today...  I must say they are rather delightful.  My mom just called and was being mom...  Well there isn't much more to talk about.  Tomorrow I get to get up bright and early at 5:20 to go out on the water with Amber and take pictures of them rowing and whatnot.  I'll update you, and maybe even show a few pictures.  Be the miracle.

        High Atop Tree Vesuvius               I took a trip to the past a few weeks ago and climbed up into my old treehouse.  As I assessed the tree from the ground floor I saw many once sturdy boards of wood had rotted only hanging onto the tree by a nail.  So I decided to name the treehouse: Tree Vesuvius, after the great volcano that covered Pompeii and Herculaem, because I have no clue when this tree will fall right under my feet.  (Optimistic, eh?)  Anyways, I attempted to climb the rickety ladder made of rope and wood blocks with great confidence figuring that my childhood troubles with this ladder were long gone and I had nothing to worry about.  After I got down from half up I attended battle scars of scraped elbows and a bruised chest, then I finally went to my father for the trusty ole metal ladder.  When I arrived at the top, I discovered the floor was layered with leaves, sticks and a few thorny branches.  I got back down to earth and grabbed a broom, a lawn chair, my book, paper, and writing stick and climbed Tree Vesuvius once more.  After I had showered the ground floor with its native twigs and branches I set up my lawn chair very carefully and slowly, due to the fact that a few boards that were my floor moved when I walked.  Then I sat there for a good ten minutes just thinking, you would be amazed how much you can think about when there isn't a radio or a television blasting your ears.  So I wrote, I read, and I just rested.  Strange how an event from so long ago can change today.

      Oh wow, I have not been this exhausted in quite a long time.  One way to NOT start off your day is run a mile in gym class for first period.  And then carry on your day which consists of poorly taken science tests and research for essays in English topped off with a math class leaving you with fifty-two math problems, half of which you don't understand, for a test the next day.  Spring Break better be awesome or I'm going to be pissed.

      I'll be on the road in a few hours and I still have things to do at home so I'll be brief...  The sinus problem has grown: I now have a canal for a nose, an apple for a throat, and a painfully frozen tundra for a chest.  The only really good thing about being sick is you get a lot of reading done, of course, if you don't like to read being sick is horrible...  I will not have access to a computer over the next few days so don't expect a bloggin'...  And hey, if you are a faithful reader (which none of you are) spread the word about my url change because I don't think too many people knew about it...  Blog ya Sunday.

      Evidentally my sinuses have it in for me.  It seems that every time I plan on going out of town, or am already in the process of being out of town my sinuses react to something and I feel like total shit.  Seriously, when we went to Aruba for vacation this summer (Yeah, Aruba) I got a massive double ear infection near the end of the week and when we flew home I basically went deaf, it took two days for my ears to go back to normal.  I got the 'sniffles' before we went to a Braves game in September and my throat started to hurt over Christmas break...  And now the day before I head to Florida for a wedding my entire head becomes a snot ball.  I think my sinuses and I should go on Dr. Phil and work out our problems.

        I really wish J.R.R. Tolkien had written an individual book about either Gandalf or King Theoden.  Gandalf is probably my favorite character in this trilogy because he seems to have a whole other life that no one knows about until someone pops up and starts talking about it.  I like the fact that in the film version of  The Return  he takes on this fatherly, almost godly, position and everyone listens to what he has to say.  I also like King Theoden because he is smart and brave enough to take the enemy head on and still die with courage.  I think Tolkien would have been a cool guy to sit down and have coffee with just because he is so smart, and there is so much going on inside his head that no one ever knew about.  No matter how geeky or cliche I'm going to sound, I'm going to say it...  I love these books.

        The Lord of the Endings  The Return of the Clapping  You know, this is a great movie and all...  But it could have ended like four times.  The main scene that was definitely not needed at the end was the 'good times with Gandalf' scene (As  urlLink Seth  and I so kindly named it).  It was too much slow motion, too much cheesy-ness, and way too much Gandalf...  They also could have edited out the scene when Frodo finishes the book 'cause they talk about it later as he leaves for the Grey Havens, so why keep the bladder bursting audience there for an extra unecessary minute?  I think the thing that really bothers me though is that when I watch this movie I can still hear the audience from December clapping at every scene and laughing at every not-so-funny moment.  God that was a terrible experience.  Tell me what you thought of this movie, did you like it, dislike it?  Did you cry?  (Admit it you weenie)

The movie, not Jesus...  I have also been meaning to introduce a new link category that I put up a while ago...  It's called  Films Past, Present, and Future ...  It's basically links to all different kinds of movies I have enjoyed or am looking forward to that have good web designs.  The coolest web design available in my links area right now would have to be  urlLink Vanilla Sky's  website, check it out...  I'll be adding more websites as the summer progresses.

      I viewed two comedies tonight, and pretty much only enjoyed one of them.  First, I went to see  Shrek 2  with my sister and friends...  I did not really enjoy it...  Sure it had it's high points, and Antonio Banderas is good in it, but all together I wasn't ecstatic when I came out of the theatre.  Then, I saw  Stuck on You ...  At first I was expecting nothing more than a morally degrading Farelly brothers film, but it turned out to be pretty decent.  It wasn't offensive like I thought it would be, and the jokes were better than I had expected...  Please, tell me what you thought of either one of these...  I would like to know.

Worked on a new feature coming to an improved clintalwahab.com called The Gollum Award.   I vanquished my roachy enemy and smote his ruin upon the mountain side.   And finally, I went streaking in Hong Kong! (I highly recommend it, Hong Kong is beautiful this time of the year.)

       Well, I might get in trouble for this, or be told to not get so personal on the blog...  But I'm going to because, guess what...  It's my blog.  So I applied for a job at Best Buy last Thursday, but have still not heard from them.  Yesterday, my dad landed a big job that is going to be very 'profitable'.  (My dad's a carpenter)  So today he asked me if I wanted to help him with the job and make a nice little hole in the wall of money.  (Actually I think of it as a hole in the wall, not him)  Now ever since I could lift a crow bar I have been working with him, and so I said sure why not...  But lately I have been having troubles with my work schedule and he has woken me up the day of the job telling me to hurry up, and I was completely unprepared for the job...  So I made it clear to him that I want to know ahead of time, and no surprises this time.  (I kind of sounded like a footbal player signing a contract)  Then, something strange happened...  I went back to the computer screen, and then he starting saying something along the lines of, 'I mean, it's better than lockin' yourself up with some big business like what you applied for'.  He was trying to lure me into working for him for good!  I quickly retorted, 'Yeah but Best Buy is where I want to work'.  Ever since I began working with him I have never enjoyed it, I have been waiting so long for a job so that I can just get away from the house so that when he needs a furniture lifter I'm not around to be tricked into doing it.  Don't get me wrong, I've tried to tell him, 'No I don't want to work for you anymore', but I can't argue with him because of other reasons we shall not get into in this post.  And then, he said it...  I've come to learn that my dad doesn't know when to stop talking when someone is pissed off at him.  'I can't believe you.  Some people would give anything to have the kind of relationship you and I have.'  (He then mumbled on to himself...)  WHAT FUCKING RELATIONSHIP?!  I  hate  working with him, he doesn't treat me fairly, sometimes makes up stuff about already paying me, and he doesn't listen to me what-so-ever!  If someone would pay to have the relationship my father and I have, I would be sold in a heartbeat.  I just thought I would share this and get some anger off of my chest...  And if I get one bloody comment about writing in a personal journal, I will track that person down and kill them.  P.S. No, my dad is not dipping in that picture.

         Wayne, You're Awesome  So I went to church tonight thinking it would be a 'classic' Wednesday night like we use to have.  But I found it was soo much better.  Wayne Baldwin, one of my greatest adult friends in life, and whom I consider family, came to church with a little surprise for me.  He walked in a showed me a humungous pack of papers bound together and wrapped in a plastic bag.  I looked at it and saw what you see up top.  It was an original Lord of the Rings The Return of the King movie script printed off for a cast member.  This aint no cheap immitation!  I began to read it later and became so intranced with it...  It's so cool to think that the thing I am reading was read by Peter Jackson or Phillipa Boyens.  It's also extremely encouraging for someone who is trying to write a script.  Thanks Wayne, you are awesome.  Here are two other shots I took:

I have my wellness exam tomorrow, wellness is the sophisticated term for gym class.  And I think this is actually going to be my hardest exam.  We spend a few weeks in the classroom every semester and that's where they get their exam material from...  And lemme tell ya, it's tough stuff.  I took my science exam today which I was rather worried about, but when I started it I found it was the second to easiest exam all week.  AND I got an eighty-fa-reakin'-seven on my Spanish exam!  That's better than my mid!  What a week my friends, what a week.

         I finally came up with a semi-decent script the other day.  I stayed up until about 1:30 on Saturday writing and developing the characters.  Writing can be so relieving because you can make the characters just how you want them, and you can love them.  One thing that is  not  relieveing is eating at Subway after church on Sunday and trying to sit down and write something decent.  Who knew Subway would be so bloody crowded?  And with the annoying type of people too?  The crowd consisted of mothers with their little daughters who think they are queens of the universe and order veggie subs.  My favorite thing about those type of kids, though, is when they try and tell the guy what they want they talk into the glass that seperates them from the food making table, and think that the guy can actually hear them.  I got a good laugh out of that one...  At least Subway is good for a picture and paragraph on a blog.  Have a good day, I'm going to go study now.

It was such a large group of ants that I just  had  to take a picture of it...  Hope you can see them, if you're bored look for the waldo ant, he should have a little red-striped shirt and a toboggan on.

         T.V. Depression  The begining of summer has become a depressing one.  Friends and Frasier are gone, The O.C. was depressing, and now Jimmy Fallon is leaving Saturday Night Live.  He definitely had the best going out skit though.  Why is it that every good SNL actor leaves at the peak of their career to go off and do other things?  Why?!

I remember it well Taxied out of a storm To watch you perform And my ships were sailing  I remember it well I was stood in your line And your mouth, your mouth, your mouth...  I want you here tonight I want you here 'Cause I can't believe what I found I want you here tonight I want you here Nothing is taking me down, down, down...  Except you my love. Except you my love...  Come all ye lost Dive into moss I hope that my sanity covers the cost To remove the stain of my love Paper mache?  Come all ye reborn Blow off my horn I'm driving real hard This is love, this is porn God will forgive me But I, I whip myself with scorn, scorn  I wanna hear what you have to say about me Hear if you're gonna live without me I wanna hear what you want I remember December And I wanna hear what you have to say about me Hear if you're gonna live without me I wanna hear what you want What the hell do you want?

        T-Roy  Okay, so I saw it.  There are many things to go over about this movie, so please bear with me.   How I Did It   So today once my mom picked me up from school I mentioned going to see a movie.  We always go right after school so we don't have to deal with the teenager crowd.  She asked if I wanted to see Troy, naturally I took advantage of the situation given my restrictions.  (My mom has banned me from all rated R movies because I saw Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind when she told me not to.)  I said ah heck why not!  So we get our seats, and she finally figures out that it's rated R.  She was rather mad at herself because she had broken her own rule.  I mentioned that at least I was in your presence when I watched it and I not out at one in the morning sneaking out to see a movie (not particularly this one).  So we stayed.   The Movie   I will have to admit, this film wasn't terribly horrible.  I've always had a certain fascination with Greek mythology, so that helped a good bit.  But, here is the downslide/disclaimer: this is not a character movie, this is strictly action, blood, and some sex.  There are cheesy lines and there are definitely inexcusable crap parts that would never happen in real life.   The acting is pretty good, though there wasn't a whole lot.  Sean Bean, my English icon, was in it so I was satisfied with the cast.  The fight scenes were...  Gladiatorical...(I'll leave it at that)  And the women were freakin' hot.   My Discovery   With this film I have finally discovered that there really isn't a single movie that I see that I don't like.  I think I like all kinds of films because I think that if I limit myself to just a specific type of film I will become too absorbed in that one type and become highly close minded.  So I like all kinds of movies, and I liked this movie.  If you can put up with lots of dirty scowls, rather bloody battles, and a little female backside and Brad Pitt's naked outline, then you will like this movie.  Oh yeah, pee like a mad-man before you go 'cause it's pretty long.   The Music   The music in this movie was total crap...  I'm sorry but it was.  Wolfgang Peterson really seems to have a fascination with women belting at the top of there lungs...  And they aren't even words it's just belting...  Much like Gladiator's music, hmmm.   The Previews   This film actually had good previews, unlike Van Helsing.  Catwoman, The Terminal, The Day After Tomorrow, and a teaser for Ocean's Twelve.  Catwoman looks half good, I'm not a huge fan of Halle Berry.  The Terminal looks incredibly awesome because it's directed by Speilberg, and starring Tom Hanks and Catherine-Zeta Jones.  I absolutely love Catherine-Zeta Jones, ever since I saw her in Intolerable Cruelty I have been sold.  I had heard of Ocean's Tweleve quite some time ago and was  very  skeptical...  But I found out that the plot is in England, and my future wife, Catherine-Zeta, is in it!  And finally, The Day After Tomorrow, this is another one of my guilty pleasures.  It looks like a complete action movie, but it looks like a good action movie.  Tell me what you think.

        Changes  So alot has changed since the begining of my freshmen year in high school.  I started off pretty confident about myself, then I became depressed because I was really having trouble figuring out who I really was, then life dragged along for a few weeks, and here I am today with opportunities awaiting me at every corner.  And I've noticed I have become a lot more popular, I had been seeking that for so long, trying to be like everyone else, and then I start doing my own thing and I'm actually talked to in the hallways.  The opportunities thing is quite strange also...  Lately I have had people (mainly teachers and authorative figures) come to me and tell me I should start getting into this or that...  Some of these things I have considered and some I have never thought of.  Example 1: my geography teacher (also the band teacher) was signing off my paper for my AP class that I'm taking next year and he asked why I wasn't going to be in band...  I sort of looked around thinking, 'What the hell?'  I have no musical training whatsoever and here he is asking me why I'm not in band!  Example 2: the great Wayne Baldwin also took a look at my schedule for next year and he asked why I'm not doing any media or electronic classes...  And once again I found myself thinking, 'What?!'  Sure I help with the sound and media at the church and have been pretty much since Jay began working there, but I'm not an electronics person!  Am I?  There are just so many opportunities that I have found waiting for me...  I've also find some extra help with my photography with an old friend from my personal art lesson days.  I actually get to go to a wedding and help photograph it!  And then there is my drawing and my writing...  And I'll hopefully be able to make some serious films this coming summer with our mission trip to Chicago...  Everything is just all starting to become an option in my life...  This is so strange.  Also, I have a lot more friends than I did at the begining of the year, and they are actually good friends whom I can talk to in seriousness.  I've found a better refuge at my church due to Life Groups; I've grown to know a specific group of guys and they have become really good friends...  That's especially cool to me 'cause there were a few I, frankly, didn't like one bit...  And now that my first year in high school is coming to a close, I'm looking back and thinking that even through the worst times, it was a good year and I'm glad it happened just the way it did.

      I just finished applying online for a job at Best Buy.  It was the only thing left basically.  I went to Barnes and Noble, Suncoast, Waldenbooks, and Borders and found out they either only hire 18 and up or already have positions filled.  Hopefully Best Buy will like me.  I'll inform you later.

       Uh, so what's the big deal about Prince?  Suddenly he has become the pop sensation he once was...  Rolling Stone has even dedicated their cover page to him, and trust me if I didn't get the mag in the mail I would not buy it...  The only music I ever liked from this guy was the music he did in Batman (Possibly the greatest comic book movie ever).  I'm sorry if you like Prince, but dang man...  I'd rather listen to Beyonce...  At least she's hot.

      Okay I swear this is the last time I change my template.  First I tried the basic skin, thought it looked bad, then I got all abstract and found out that it doesn't compute with macs...  So then I changed it to this, but couldn't understand the coding so I went to another form of abstract and thought it looked bad... So finally I came back to this, figured out the coding and here we are...  The sad thing is the last three steps happened today...

         Hahaha... Wait this is cool.  Well I saw Van Helsing tonight because I have to admit, I have been looking forward to this movie.  It's one of those guilty pleasures.  When it comes down to 'yes' and 'no', I'll have to say 'YES'.  It's a total action flick, but if you are going to go action, go with Van Helsing.  Sure it's ruled by CGI, but it has the utmost classics evils: The Werewolf, Frankenstein, Egor, Dracula, and the brides of Dracula!  How cool can you get?!  Plus Hugh Jackman knows how to do action flicks.  There are the corny lines every now and then, and there are the impossible jumps from buildings.  But hey, you're watching an action flick by the same director as The Mummy, what'd you expect?  So, in conclusion my final rating for this film would have to be a four out of five...  And I command you to see it now.

      Oh my dear Lord, I have never watched a better episode of The O.C.  I am actually depressed now because of what happened.  Josh Schwartz really does a great job of developing characters and relating them to the viewer. (a high school loser like myself (not self-pity))  The thing that made this episode so powerful was the ending...  It finally wasn't your typical teeny-bopper show, it was cinemagraphic and personal.  They had Rufus Wainewright's  Alleilua  playing which, if you've heard it you would understand, made it tremendously deep.  Well, I had better go to sleep before this sinks in too much and I get emo about it...  Yeah, I'm weird, I'm aware...

      A poem by one of my friends in my English class (edited by me, cause it sounded awkward (no offense)):  The weathered old man lay in the corner, Overlooked by many bystanders, With tears streaking down on the sidewalk, And filled with regret the old man sighed. He then fully realized that he would need another job If he wanted more crack-cocaine.

So to those who haven't seen it and don't want to know the 'surprise' at the end, don't read my review.  To the lost emo soul I say to you:  boo-frickin'-hoo .  P.S.

       Just got back from  Spiderman 2 .  It was definitely better than the first one.  The action scenes were incredible, the cinematography was decent, but the dialogue...  Man oh man, they need to work on their dialogue...  There were so many corny lines, some lines I actually laughed out loud or giggled because it was so incredibly cheesey.  Either way, it's still good because it's a comic legend and they did a great job of living up to the name.  They already set up third though.  Harry Osbourne will become the Green Goblin, and the astronaut (MJ's boy toy) will go into space and bring back Venom.  Most excited about that.  Oh yeah, don't take the kiddies to see this, it's pretty violent.  The first action scene with Doc Ock actually scared me, it was so violent and 'war-like'.  If the kid is under 13, don't take 'em.

      So, this  urlLink Habbo  thing has gotten more and more fun, and more and more serious.  First, I had some furniture stolen from me in an unfair trade...  (Long story)  Then I decided to change rooms cause I didn't like the set up.  My new room is called The James Effect.  Yes it is named after the book of James.  I call it the 'effect' because what he says is so impactful and really sticks to you and makes you think.  And now I'm going to pull an Andrew Jones and use it as a tool for devotionals, discussion groups, and totally hanging out.  If you are not a habbo, now is the time to become one...  It's awesome.  The James Effect room will be re-furnished in the next week, once I get more money.

      So I'm still on the 'Camp High'.  The 'Camp High' is that ultra urge to read the bible and pray that you have after a week of camp.  So during my camp high I read the first half of the first chapter of James.  I had heard some good stuff about the book of James, so I decided to give it a shot.  It's pretty cool so far, he knows how to tell it like it is, and say what is right and what is wrong.  Of course, I hope to go beyond this camp high and make it a life style, that's why I have you (the reader), my personal journal, and candles to set the mood.  So as of right now you guys are my giant, internet accountability partner.

        Viva La Revolucion   Just a few pictures from camp...  I had such a bloody good time, both spiritually and relationship wise, we have formed a little group of crazy hooligans who I think will one day rule the camps, mission trips, and most importantly the Late Nite.   Amy-Jo was the leader on my bus both to and from.   Garret took a little nap on the way home, he's also the best bosom buddy a man could ask for.   We caught Troy bowman lurking around our cabin uninvited so we decided to tie him up and spray girly perfume on him.  (One of the highlights of the week)   Darrel paid a visit with the Girardier child, Diesel.   Danny Poole, the ultimate cabin leader.   Justin Landis...  Need I say more?   Lots of huddling.   Greg was our speaker and is now one of my favorite people, I really wished he lived in Nashville.   The hammock was our spot for yelling at the girls cabin right next to us, they sat out there for three hours one day yelling non stop at them.  Seriously, non stop screaming.   We had nightly gatherings in the living room for stories and bubble gum jokes from Matthew and Justin.   Cam...  I'm working on uploading videos right now...  I'll post them later though.

I'll blog on either Friday or Saturday, I'll have pictures and journal notes for posting when I get back.  P.S. First person to guess what the picture is correctly wins...

      Lately I haven't been able to get to sleep until about three in the morning just because I've gotten use to staying up or I had caffeine at ten.  So, I'll read my book for a while, finish a chapter, and click on the television.  NBC really has it together, even at three in the morning they are showing primetime shows.  Last night I watched Dr. Phil, you know at three thirty in the morning he doesn't seem like such a hick.  The other night I watched a two month old Tonight Show (Still bad even when dreary eyed) and a week old Conan episode.  I wish ABC would get their act together like that and show more Friends episodes like they do at 10:35 and 11:05. (For those of you who don't live in Nashville, our local ABC station shows old episodes of Friends, I'm not sure if all of ABC does, but we do.)  Of course, if they did that I would be up all night and never sleep again...  Maybe I should just go to sleep and not worry about what's on at three, but what fun is that?

      My mom went to South Carolina this week to visit family and won't return until tomorrow.  One new thing she will be returning with is a new car.  My grandfather is a car dealer so every time we visit we go to see him at work, and usually we browse the lot.  Well this time my mom browsed and found something...  And bought it today.  It's a mini-van of course (They're good for traveling).  What's awesome about this mini-van though is that it has a DVD player, XML satelite radio, 6 disc cd player, and leather seats.  So until I take driver's ed, which won't be until the fall, I get to cruise around in the pimped out soccer mom's van.  It's not too bad though cause I've gotten use to driving a mini-van and don't mind it anymore.  And plus, leather seats dude.

Celebrity Crush- Christina Aguilera, some think of her as a whore, I like to think of her as Christina Alwahab. Music- Train, I listened to them a lot when I was young so I've grown to like them. Entertainment- Computer games, that's my only form of video game entertainment so I prefer playing on the computer instead of PS2. Clothes- American Eagle khaki shorts and jeans, think what you may, but they are comfortable.

      Yesterday my mom called from work and told me that she printed off two coupons for Borders, one for a book and one for a CD.  We went to see  The Stepford Wives  later that night, but had to hang around for a little bit because we had to wait for the next showing.  So she said why don't we just go to Borders now?  Sure, I like getting presents early!  I only ended up picking out a CD, we're going back today for the other stuff.  I picked Muse's  Absolution  and with my own money I bought the discounted to ten dollars  Good News for People Who Love Bad News  by Modest Mouse.  I actually really like the Modest Mouse album, there are a few songs that they had to be on something when they wrote them though (The Devil's Workday).  My mom said that I could also pick out a movie since I am such a movie drone.  So I was looking around having now clue which one I could get that wasn't R and then...   I found it.  Them would probably be the better word.  The Widescreen Edition of the Indiana Jones Collection with an extra DVD of special features.  My mom looked at it and said she wants to look for it somewhere else (Cheaper).  So I'm pretty sure I'm getting that for my birthday!  I'm going to show a picture of the cake later, you have no idea how cool it is.  All I can say is Spiderman.  Now, onto  The Stepford Wives .  I'm sure by now all of you know the plot of this movie and most of you probably think it looks stupid.  Originally this movie was a thriller and then the person who decided to re-do this obviously saw it as a very humorous film.  And they did a great job of making this a very funny film.  The ending was sort of strange but it was still a good summer flick.  Not much more than that...  Of course, there are Faith Hill and Nicole Kidman walking around and looking incredibly gorgeous...  That's a plus.

          Boy, George...  I just finished  Star Wars Episode II  and discovered that I  still  don't like this movie.  Oh sure, it has a lot more action than  Episode I  but the acting is still so blatantly bad.  Ewan McGregor was good but he had still some extremely corny lines.  But I'm not going to blame to poorness of this film on the actors, no no.  I blame it on Lucas.  He's gotten a little too CGI happy with 1 and 2, and now he is paying for it.  There is just way too much CGI in this film.  The originals were incredible because everything was real.  We look back now and kind of laugh at it, but the truth is that that is amazing that everything was a model or make up and then they made it look real on screen.  But with 1 and 2, instead of using mini models and actually getting creative with the making of the film, Lucas has made everything CGI.  Don't get me wrong I'm all for CGI, but there  is  a limit and I think he crossed it when he made 'bom-bad' Jar Jar Binks.  I just hope that Lucas won't screw up the next one because I'm actually looking forward to this one.

      So in trying to sink back into the Word I started looking around all the books of the bible looking specifically at chapter six verse twelve.  Why?  Well that's my birthday and I thought it would be cool if I found something meaningful...  Turns out I found some meaningful ones and some not-so meaningful ones.  Meaningful   We do not want you to become lazy, but to imitate those who through faith and patience inherit what has been promised.  Hebrews 6:12  Being expected of something has always motivated me for some reason.   Fight the good fight of faith.  Take hold of the eternal life to which you were called when you made your good confession in the presence of many witnesses. 1 Timothy 6:12  That's basically telling me what I need to do with my christian life if I want to live it true...  And you can't get more meaningful than that.   Not-so Meaningful   A scoundrel and a villain, who goes about with a corrupt mouth.  Proverbs 6:12  Well I've cursed before but scoundrel?  Lighten up man.   He that is far away will die of plague, and he that is near will fall by the sword, and he that survives and is spared will die of famine.  Ezekiel 6:12  I like to think that I have happy times ahead.  Not plagues, or famine, or a bloody death.   Those who want to make a good impression outwardly are trying to compel you to be circumcised.  The only reason they do this is to avoid being persecuted for the cross of Christ.  Galatians 6:12  You know, if somone starts talking to me about getting circumcised I'll have to remind them of the second part of Ezekiel 6:12, 'and he that is [a little too] near will fall by the sword [of Clint Alwahab]'.  Okay so maybe I didn't find a whole lot of meaningful verses, but I found a couple.

        Ssh, God's Speaking  Well it has taken me a long time to finally figure this out but I've finally found how God speaks to me.   urlLink Seth  had spoken of how God speaks to him through fortune cookies a while back, and it got me thinking about how God is telling me He's still around.  And the other day it was revealed to me.  I'm a sarcastic person, and I make a lot of jokes that only I would get or take a long time to explain.  God is too.  The other day my mom and I had to drive to Franklin to get vacuum bags (Yeah, apparently they don't sell them any where else).  So as I sat in the car I watched through the window as the vacuum salesman (What a job) started to show my mom the new and latest vacuum.  She stood there for a while, asked a few questions, you know just to be nice.  But the vacuum salesman would not let her leave without letting her check out all the new accessories and gadgets, and right at that moment lightning struck behind me and reflected in the window right where the salesman was standing.  You may not find this humorous but I find it really funny cause at that moment I was starting to think that all salesmen are minions of Satan and obviously God put a little spin on the joke with some lightning. Another way I know He's watching out is all the crazy things I see on Concord Road.  I see all the weird yet funny stuff on that last bit of Concord Road as you are about to turn onto Franklin.  I once saw a Brentwood Cop pulling over a Krispy Kreme Doughnuts van.  I saw a garbage truck with the phrase 'Don't litter!  Recycle!' on the side of his doors cut off someone and then spill two empty water barrels used in offices onto the road.  And then, of course, there are the cows that live in the pasture next to the road.  I swear these cows are possesed, they do the weirdest things.  I once saw one chasing a car, of course he was behind his fence but he still just ran along side of the car.  I also saw a cop pull over a person on the cow's side of the road and cow just walked right up to them and stared at them, looking back and forth as if he was the cops back up. So as I just explained, God makes me laugh, and that's how He speaks to me and lets me know that He's still up there watching.  I would encourage you find how God is talking to you cause it's a lot of fun when you figure it out.

       Days That Are Over   Sondre Lerche   One hundred thousand cars have passed this house The celebration starts with laughter  Can it be that we're not clean? The days have turned to haze Tell me how we should have lied To keep away this space To keep from snowing in Keep from lingering Keep our worlds apart  When it comes to letting go Let the quicksand flow When I write it in the sand There is something wrong  Days that are over Will not continue to last If you try to construct the past  I leave the heat on to leave a trace Of all the things the air was filled with  All the words I never knew And all the words I know Now they all come out too late for you to realize Satisfy my luck This director's cut Doesn't spare an inch  I have never seen this place and no surrounding walls As the party turns to dust They all understand  Days that are over Will not continue to last If you try to construct the past

       Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas  This caught my inner-thoughts for some reason, it seemed kind of meangingful but I don't know why now...   History is hard to know, because of all the hired bullshit, but even without being sure of 'history' it seems entirely reasonable to think that every now and then the energy of a whole generation comes to a head in a long fine flash, for reasons that nobody really understands at the time- and which never explain, in retrospect, what actually happened.   After re-reading and re-reading I can't really explain what it means...  Maybe that's because I read it late at night and wasn't fully aware, maybe it's because I'm listening to music as I read this, maybe it's becuase it was written by a druggy, or maybe it's because I am a complete moron...  Can someone please explain it?

       Oh my goodness, I do not like shopping for clothes.  Especially at Holister, the fitting rooms are one giant room...  I feel dirty trying on clothes in there.  I was able to make up for it, however, by purchasing  Two Way Monologue  by  Sondre Lerche  and the self titled album by  Franz Ferdinand .  I decided to hold off on the  Slipknot  just for safety's sake, and I wanted some extra money to buy posters at the movie theatre this Friday, they are selling them again!  I've also been meaning to show this for a while but have never gotten around to it.  I've started to do collages with photographs from magazines and my own art...  Here's one, it's not my favorite.  I guess you could consider it a tribute to music, but I just ended up having musicians in all of the photos...  I have two others that I will show later that I am more proud of.  Tell me what you think of this one.

Hopefully I will be able to see  The Stepford Wives  original movie tomorrow and give a review...  Don't expect too much blogging from me for the next few days because I have really been drawing a blank on what to write...  I'm trying to conserve some of writing also because I hope to do some good writing soon.

      As you can tell from the newly designed sidebar I am listening to music like crazy.  I realize that I am listening to Korn, but I'm experimenting right now, and I think I won't like it.  But I plan to buy the new Slipknot album not matter what.  I have heard a rather encouraging review about it in Rolling Stone, they said some of the songs have a 'Beatle-esque' sound to them...  So I thought I would give it a try.   I've made two new categories on the side bar as well.   Listening- Vinyl  and  Soon to Own ...  Please enjoy.

        Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban   Holy mother, this was awesome.  Everything about it was awesome...  I'm not even going to go into detail because it was so fa-reakin' (Sorry Seth, no other way of explaining it) awesome.  The new director did a superb job of 'growing up' this series.  He went beyond the basics of the school and of witchcraft and added more spark to it, and he made the characters real and believable.  He actually got cinemagraphic with it which Chris Columbus, I think, failed to do.  This was so cool.  Although...  I think it should be categorized in the 'cult films' section.  Once you have people clap during your movie and dress up in character for your movie, then you knwo you have a cult film.  Much like  Lord of the Rings .  I guess the word I would use to describe this movie is...   Culty-filmtabulous-de-awesomeness .  Yep, that's the word.

        The Day After Tomorrow I'll Be Snoozin'  That spark or that pull that I had spoken of that made me want to see this, that made me feel like there was something more to this film was a total crock.  This movie sucked...  Period.  There was no dialogue, it was just a typical Armageddon movie.  The cast consisted of people who I looked at and said, 'Wait I've seen you somewhere' so I worried about who the cheesy actors were during the whole film.  The only good actor in this was Ian Holm (Bilbo).    It was so typical because, 1. The main character was related to a weather expert who knew what this storm could do. 2. The father of the main character decides to go save his son. 3. There is a girl. 4. It was so extremely corny.  Every line was just cheese after cheese...  I would say this is a total action flick, but it's not even that really...  It's just one of Roland Emmerich's other ways of showing us how we can all die...  I also think that Roland Emmerich and the other person who wrote this are against Bush because at the end they had the president, who didn't care about the environment at all, talk about using up natural resources too much and then he apologized to his country for messing up...  It was so obvious that they wanted that president to portray Bush it hurt...  Anyways, this movie was crap...  Total crap, don't waste your money.  At least I have Harry Potter to help me recover from this.

      Man, sleeping till noon is such a satisfying feeling.  I was suppose to help my dad today, but the lady decided she wanted to leave her stairs how they were (carpeted) so I got to stay home.  Sure it was a missed shot at sixty more bucks, but who cares I got to sleep in!  I did not get to see  The Day After Tomorrow  last night because my mom didn't really think everything through and didn't realize that if we go to a seven o'clock showing, she will get out past her bedtime.  (She gets up at 4 on days she has to work (She's a nurse at Vanderbilt Children's Hostpital))  So she said that tonight we will go once she gets off work.  And then on Friday it's Harry Potter day, my mom  did  manage to get those tickets and I think they are for the first showing.  (Totally stoked)  As you can tell I am preparing myself for the Harry Potter invasion, much like I will be doing when Spiderman 2 comes out and when any other sequel or remake comes out.  Since I haven't done it yet I'm going to give a list of all the movies I am looking forward to...  Here goes:  The Terminal Spiderman 2 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Stepford Wives Garden State Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow Collaterol I, Robot (kinda)  The Village The Bourne Supremacy   I would have said  Coffee and Cigarettes  but I'm trying to not get too hyped about it because I know it will be R and my mom is weird about R movies...  Also, if you look at the side bar you will see that I am listening to Pink Floyd...  I'm experimenting with music right now and trying to collide all types of genres to see what I get...  I can't figure out which Zeppelin album to buy though, so perhaps some classic rock fans out there could guide me?

      Oh geez, I've had to work with my dad for the past two days and it is soo exhausting...  We had to tear up a bathroom ceramic floor, rip up carpet from a stairwell, then sand every bit of the stairs so that we can stain them in a few days.  The only thing that is good about working with my dad is I make 10 bucks an hour...  Right now I'm at 90 bucks and tomorrow I should make another 60...  As nice as the pay is, I'm definitely going to have to find some other job because I'm going insane.  I most likely won't though...  Oh geez...  I'm going to see  The Day After Tomorrow  tonight and I am buying my  Harry Potter  tickets in advance for Friday.  Woo hoo!  I'll give a review of  TDAT  later tonight.

      I think I need to get out of this Lord of the Rings rift.  Mainly because everytime a tire screeched on the highway while we were driving or I heard someone scream I immediately thought 'Nazgul'.  And then when I talk about stuff from The Lord of the Rings I refer to them in their elvish or some other form other than regular English name...  Yep, me and Tolkien definitely need some off time.

      Well, I greatly apologize for the mess up over the weekend.  For some reason my server likes to say that I have used up too much space I haven't done a thing...  Oh well...  The wedding was great, I had a lot of fun and was able to get a few good photos in black and white.  Here are a few:           The rest I won't show because they are of people you don't know...  Other than that not much has happened, just been taking pills to get rid of my allergies and sitting around and finishing my book.  Please note the new header picture, I took that at the wedding after the ceremony...  There were two doves flirtin' on the fountain and i crept up close enough to get them right as they were flying away...  Same with the new comment picture...  Please tell me what you think.

        Life Outside 'The Bubble'    As most of you know I was extremely nervous two weeks ago about the mission trip to Chicago that I took last week.  I had spoken with interns and prepared myself as much as possible, but I don't think I could have prepared myself enough for such an incredible experience.  This was my first out of state mission trip, and it was a doozy.  We left Friday and arrived in Chicago on Saturday.  Saturday consisted of unpacking, opening celebration, and finding our crew.  Sunday was a get to know your crew day.  We were grouped with another church from Oxford, Mississippi and we worked with Armitage Baptist, one of the largest churches in Chicago.  Sunday was the day we went to a park and played sports...  And invented sports.  (Quarball)   Then all the planning and preperation that we had done since June came to use on Monday.  That's when the culture shock happened.  Monday was a slow day for our team because we only had three kids that spoke minimal English and their mother who only spoke Spanish.  Day two, what an incredible leap of faith.  We went from three kids to 41, including parents.  That was when I really saw God starting to move.  I got to know some really cool, whacky kids and got to see what kind of life these kids grow up in.  They grow up in such a different life style.  Gangs hang out on their streets, homeless people sleep on their doorsteps, and some are even abused.  There was one girl that I fear is an abused child.  She was the sweetest girl, but was so scared and cautious.  Her mother was very strict and very mean.  As her mother left she yelled at her on how to sit properly.  She really touched my heart because that was when I realized what kind of city we were dealing with, this wasn't your momma's mission trip, this was real and it was serious.  Tuesday night was the night that we had nothing planned so our group went downtown.  We then split up into smaller groups so that we could go where we pleased.  Dave, Seth, and Grant were in my group.  We decided to eat dinner at The Cheesecake Factory.  We didn't leave their until 8:45 and we had to be back at the subway at 9:30.  We didn't have time to go to Virgin Records, which was what I had been looking forward to for quite some time, I was rather pissed and was rather exhausted so I retired for the night at 10:30.  Lights out was at eleven.   We had a smaller number of kids on Wednesday, mainly because some were going to a birthday party or doctor's appointment.  So it was somewhat of a recovery day for some because quite a few were still tired.  We got to get to know more kids though which was awesome.  Some kids that came Tuesday brought a friend or an older brother so that was good.  Then Thursday was our emotional farewell.  I am extremely proud of Chandler Kellog because he was not afraid to talk to kids and ended up bringing a young man to Christ.  One of the ministers from Armitage visited our site because his kids were there and he ended up talking to Chandler, Matt, and I and we prayed with Matt and he accepted Christ as his savior.  Chandler is a great example of ministering because he was not afraid to talk to Matt and talk about the bible whilst playing football or what not.   This was all together an incredible experience.  The worship time that we had at night was good only because we were able to reflect on the day and really see what God was doing and that made worship such an uplifting time for me.  I didn't neccesarily like the speaker but I still enjoyed his rather basic sermons.  I learned more stuff from myself and from prayer.  As I said before, Wednesday night was the cry night.  Our group went up on the roof of the circular dormitory that we stayed in and shared all that God was doing.  I ended up talking to God really in depth and just thanking Him for so much stuff.  I began to cry when I realized how perfect His plan was.  I realized that everything that went on this week was perfect and happened exactly how it needed to.  Nothing should have changed.  I realized that our church on every block town needs to be like that because we then go out to the unchurched cities and minister to them because we know Christ, but they don't.  And if we weren't the expensive churched out town that we are there wouldn't be anyone to go out to Chicago.  That's when I began to breakdown.  I didn't care who was around me anymore, I didn't care how typical christian it was.  Everyone needs a good cry and a good hug.  I thank  urlLink Karyn  for being there for me and praying for me.  She was the shoulder I needed, she didn't ask questions she just knew that I needed someone to cry on.  It's amazing how God moves.   So, in conclusion: God is amazing.  I don't think there is anyway to denie the existence of God after such an incredible experience such as that.  If you did not go on this mission trip, and go to BBC, I encourage you to think and pray about it and prepare yourself to go on the next one.  If we don't go to Chicago though I will have to beat Jay...  In the name of Christ of course.  Until next time.

        Sooo much to blog about.  But not the time for it.  I'm still somewhat tired, I have millions of clothes to wash, and I don't have pictures yet.  I wish I had taken the digital camera so I could have pictures right now but oh well.  I only took two rolls of film because that's all I had so I'm going to put a lot of  urlLink Seth's  pics up too because all of his are freakin' incredible.  This week really has changed a lot in me.  Not like the usual ways, I actually learned something new that I hadn't heard before and some of it I was able to figure out on my own.  I love this group of people that went and I hope God moved with them as much as He did with me.  P.S. Chicago's climate needs to move to Tennessee. P.P.S. That's a preview of Seth's glorious pictures. P.P.P.S. That is Ricky in the pic, he was one of my favorite kids because he was so insanely hyper.

      Once again blogging from Chicago, but on Seth's mac.  This week has been incredible.  Everything about it.  The week started off really slow and pesimistic but it gradually got better and better.  I've gotten to know some people really well and grown stronger in friendships with people I already knew.  The other night was the breaking point.  We, as a church group, met together on the roof and it was the crying fest.  Yes, I cried...  but I've realized that it is neccesary.  I realized that this week is a blessing and we are doing nothing but glorifying God.  I really think that we need to come back here for the next few years because this is the place, this is the place for witnessing and spreading God.  Got to go now, most of us are leaving for the mother of all thrift stores.  A few of us went yesterday and discovered that Chicago is thrift city.  So basically the whole group is going to a bigger store to get some mad clothes.  Catch you later.  Home is so close now.  P.S. Lots to blog later.

      Blogging from the iBook laptop of Darrel Girardier in The Windy City.  The past few days have been really great.  The first night we stopped after about eight hours of Grey Hounding and stayed in Amy-Jo's home town of Chatham.  I'm rather surprised that our host home was not mad at us because we made so much noise.  I can't count how many times we ran in the wall or squirmed on the floor as Kyle credit carded us.  Then the next day we headed out to Chicago.  We stopped for lunch just about an hour out of Chicago and I got my first taste of some deep-dish/ real tomato pizza.  The first whole day we were there was sort of a settle down, figure out what we're doing, and get to know the other churches.  This is the first time I actually unpacked my bag when we arrived and organized all of my clothes.  The other church that was teamed up with us went to a park with our church and we meshed and got to know one another.  That day was the most laughable because Darren, Seth, myself, Brian and a few others invented a new game called Quarball.  See Seth's blog for the team photo and details.  Finally today we got to do mission work.  I'm working with little kids...  Right now our camp is very small...  about three people small.  Today was a very slow day, we got to meet Eduardo the two year old balogna eating child, Oscar the accidental grabber in tag, and Jasmine...  Their sister.  Luckily we met a few older guys that knew the city and knew Christ.  At first they looked like extreme hooligans, but Dave was the brave one and took a few people over and gave them some of our extra snacks.  We discovered that they are the nicest people in Chicago.  Seriously, I can't wait to play flag football tomorrow with them.  We played Piggy today.  In Piggy you use a giant softball that is really soft and someone hits it out to the people in the field and whoever catches it is the batter.  It's a fun game, and it really brought us closer to them.  God is working, but He's working slowly.  The family of three doesn't really speak that much English, nor the mother, so there is a barrier, but I have the feeling God will take us where we need to be.  Please continue to pray for me and all of us.  I'm going to go assess the damage of the loud crash I just heard, see you later.

      Final preperations have begun for the trip tomorrow.  I'm quite nervous, but my beloved intern friends tell me it's natural, so that sooths me somewhat.  I'm hoping for a lot of things this week but I'm not sure how this week will play out.  I fear I'm going to have to take charge with our group because I'm pretty much the only guy in our Day Camp/Rec. group, and I think the girls are going to ask me to be the person that explains the games and what not.  It doesn't sound like much, but I have terrible stage fright.  Granted this is no stage but I still have to be a big example.  I hope I'm making sense.  There is a lot more to say but I don't know how to say it so I'm going to depart.  I probably will not blog again.  I give my best wishes to Sam who gets married on Saturday to her high school sweetheart, and I apologize a million times for not being able to make it.  Pray for those two and pray for us in Chicago.

        Just saw the tv preview for  urlLink  Garden State   and I have become even more excited.  This is one of those films that you have to see no matter what is standing in your way.  Even though it's rated R I am going to try my hardest to see it.  Zach Braff is awesome.  That is all.

       Watch the people scatter Watch them run for the hills Run for another day Run for a happier life Survival is the key Survival is never in death Death is never another step Death is always the end The end to life The end to everything Everything is never after life Everything is always right here, right now. "There is always a beginning There is always an end" We never realize death is part of life, Until we are forced to say it at the funeral.   I have been racking my brain for the past few days to find a creative spot.  Finally I produced something, whether it makes sense or not I don't know.  Let me know what you think of it  P.S. I decided I need a different rapper/poet name...  It's just not workin' for me.

      After watching every episode of 'I Love the 90's' I have found a butt-load of albums that I want to buy now.  The only problem is, I'm dirt poor.  I already had a list before I watched 'I Love' and so now the list has doubled...  Maybe ye readers can help me in deciding which ones I should purchase first...   90's:   Run D.M.C. -  Founders of rap, I'm interested in seeing how different rap was back then.  And plus I think Darryl McDaniels is actually a giant teddy bear on the inside.  Fiona Apple -  She may be a complete weirdo, but what I heard sounded really good.  Oasis -  Everyone hailed them on  90's , sorta...  Jane's Addiction -  Saw them on an old episode of SNL and became interested and then investigated and now I'm even more interested.  Alanis Morsette -  I'm not sure if I spelled it right but she is awesome.  I was too young to get the concept of purchasing CD's when she was a hit though.   04's:   The Roots -  Saw them perform with Toots and the Maytol on SNL and was interested and then saw a music video on VH1 once and thought they sounded good.  The Cure -  I've always liked them and when I heard about their latest album I was most excited.  Too bad I won't be here when they perform.  Wilco -  Need I say more?  Ben Kweller - I was doubting him, but saw him on Conan the other night and  really  liked him.  The Polyphonic Spree -  I had planned on buying their new album the day it came out but I was still in Hilton Head so I didn't get around to it.  I've heard this album is longer and better. (And not in a dirty, perverted way.)   Let's see  how many  more   times I  can  use  the  bold  and  italics buttons!    Tell me  which ones I should  get fi  rst  on the  comment bu  tton  of life.

       Movie Review...  If you don't like it, don't read it.  Well, I saw  I, Robot  tonight.  I think they tried to go deep, and try and answer the questions of purpose, but it's hard to take a robot questioning his purpose seriously.  I wish I could find a picture of my favorite scene because it was so  Dead Man Walking .  It's definitely a good action flick, that's all I have to say.  P.S. Was anyone else rooting for the robots at one point or another?

      Tonight has been quite an adventure.  At about five  urlLink Kyle  asked me to come over and having been annoyed from 1:30 to 4:30 because the same girl called me literally non stop.  You think I'm exagerating but I'm not, I would tell her off and she would call back.  So I immediately accepted Kyle's invitation and went to his house.  We then proceeded over to the great Matthew Reese's house and then continued to play in the park and play with road kill.  Randolph the Rabbit Road Kill was completely desecrated.  We had fireworks a-plenty and matches a-plenty.  I won't go into details because it is so vulgur but I will say that it was plastered to the concrete when we were finished.  Now I am still at Kyle's and am about to go take a shower and watch  Revolutions .  Good night.

        I found my name.  3k-elenfant and I came up with a few names and we decided this is the best one:  Ami?r .  It's pronounced Uhmeer.  Amir is my middle name and I played around with it and found Am I in there so I put a question mark in there.  Sort of like Black Eyed Peas's Will.I.Am, but oh well.

      After reading all the interns' blogs about their adventures in Starbucks, Borders, and everywhere else cool, I've decided that I definitely need to get out more.  I think that might help get some of the issues off my mind.  (The annoying girls that I will  NEVER  date)  I also decided as I laid in my bed last night that I need a new nickname.  You know how all the cool rappers or all the poets on  Def Poetry  have seriously cool names and can use that name in their song or poem and sound even cooler cause it just flows right off the tongue?  I want one of those names.  At the moment I can't think of any good ones but I'll get back to you with a list.  If you have any  clean  and  wholesome  suggestions by all means, suggest away.

      Good grief, I have so many books I want to read right now.  I wish I could read them all at once.  And having to read stupid school books about hell and the halocaust are not my favorites but are number one on my list.  Books I want to read right now:  Dracula Frankenstein The Bourne Identity The Invisible Man Harry Potter 4 and 5 (re-read) The Two Towers (re-read) About a Boy (Sorry Bethany, I never got to it)  If only I had magical powers that allowed me to read eight books at one time.  I'm sure that pops up somewhere in Harry Potter.

       Summer is always great, the best time is the first full week of just sitting around and sleeping 'til twelve.  But soon enough the sitting and the staying up becomes tiring.  In some ways I am ready for school.  In lots of other ways I am not.  This year is going to be a lot harder than the last.  Mainly because I am taking English history AP and English 2 honors.  This year is going to be a  lot  of writing.  Plus I'm an idiot and didn't take driver's ed. this summer so I'm going to have to take it during the semester meaning I won't get home until six for two weeks.  The only thing I'm looking forward to is the inspiration.  I find a lot of my poetry and photographs pertaining to school and work related activities.  So in a sense school will be nice.  I believe I have begun to ramble so I will depart now.

      As I said before I had free HBO, Starz and Encore all week at the 'resort' we stayed at.  The films I watched were:  Blade 2 ** Eyes Wide Shut **1/2 Phone Booth *** How To Deal *** 28 Days Later **** Open Range **** Buffalo Soldiers *** Re-watched The Memoirs of an Invisible Man ****  Sorry Seth, I totally stole your star rating thing.  I might have left out one movie but I'll get to it.  I missed a few that I really wished I had seen: Frida, The Good Girl, and Punch Drunk Love.  I'll give reviews of these films over the next few days, so if you haven't seen any, go see 'em or don't read my reviews.

       For some reason I have been angry for the past few days.&nbsp; I'm not sure if it sleep deprevation, pesky people calling my home, or just the fact that I have lost my sanity but I am angry at lots of things and people.&nbsp; Some of them I have no reason to be mad at and some I have perfectly good reasons, either way I fear I will take it out on the wrong person soon.&nbsp; Later tonight I will be premiering the new Complicated Simplicity look. &nbsp;(Maybe I'm mad cause I'm such a blogging loser)&nbsp; I was going to wait until August 15th but school anxiety and nuisancy has already begun the attack and I need to fight back.&nbsp; But for the time being I have to help my dad fill pot holes in our drive way and then sleep some of this anger off. &nbsp; That reminds me of something else, all week I have been having really disturbing dreams.&nbsp; I don't know why but I have had lots of dreams of death and destruction.&nbsp; The only dreams I can remember are of planes exploding in mid air and falling into the ocean, family members being killed, and lots of other disturbing images that have haunted me in my childhood.&nbsp; What's really disturbing is the plane explosion dream was subtle,&nbsp;my family and I were sitting on the beach and a bi-plane was flying over the ocean with a banner on the back of it and suddenly the engine blew up and the plane went sailing into the ocean&nbsp;and we sat there as if it was normal and then went on as if nothing had happened.&nbsp; Maybe this is stage one of insanity.

       The Normal Paragraph (TV-PG)  I'm feeling completely out of the loop after looking at all the updated blogs and info that I haven't heard about.&nbsp; Oh well, hopefully life will return to normal extremely soon because I'm sick of the beach.&nbsp; I never really enjoy family vacations because it always ends up being just me and my parents.&nbsp; Raina couldn't go this year, and Amber had to leave mid-week because she had to work so it was just me and the old people for the rest of the week.&nbsp; My self esteem was completely shot on Thursday for many different reasons, and by the time Saturday came I was thanking the sweet Lord Jesus for such a thing as 'home'.&nbsp; I took&nbsp;two&nbsp;rolls of photographs and&nbsp;maybe three&nbsp;shots on the&nbsp;digital camera so it might be a few days before I can get pictures up. &nbsp;  The Anger Paragraph (TV-14)  The&nbsp;main thing that&nbsp;helped me keep my sanity this whole week was  I Love the 90's  and free HBO, STARZ, and ENCORE.&nbsp; I watched movies every night that I&nbsp;had been wanting to see, and yes...&nbsp; I made reviews for all of them, so those who don't like my reviews, blog,&nbsp;or&nbsp;my life shut up and fucking deal with it.&nbsp; (Terribly sorry for the&nbsp;profanity but some people&nbsp;really know how to bug me)&nbsp; And to those little&nbsp;eighth graders that continue to call my home, stop it now.&nbsp; I am desperately serious, the first time it was funny but now you are&nbsp;pests.&nbsp; Just get it through your heads&nbsp;that there will never be a time that we will date or most likely even talk to each other so start calling somone your own&nbsp;age. &nbsp; There was something else that was on my mind that I wanted to talk about but it has left me and I am running on fumes right now so I believe I will go sleep.

      I leave for vacation in a few minutes so I thought I would inform you that I will not be blogging until next Saturday or Sunday.  I bought a telephoto lens for 75 bucks from my art mentor yesterday so I should have some pretty good shots when I come back.  I'll put them on a disc when I get them printed and show them here.

      So I leave for vacation on Friday and since my parents ended up buying the mini van with a DVD player in it I have been planning on buying new movies for viewing all week.  And finally after about three, maybe four, months of sweet talking, bribing, and coaxing I finally bought  The Matrix Revolutions .  For those of you that don't know my mother banned all R rated movies that we did not own from being watched by me back in April because I saw the glorious  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind  when she said not to.  (Yeah yeah, 'what a rebel')  And so finally tonight when we drove to Hollywood Video to return the ga-jillion movies we rented (Seriously, putting them in the drop box was like waiting at the DMV, no quick action walk by-drop in motion.) I walked over to the used DVD's section and purchased  The Matrix Revolutions  and the brilliant  Minority Report .  Oh what a glorious day.  Buying movies with your own money is so satisfying.

        Weenies who haven't seen Frankenstein look away  For some reason I have found a sudden interest in classic horror films such as Dracula, Frankenstein, The Wolf Man etc.  I think I will be watching more and more and give reviews on them as time goes by.  I watched  Frankenstein  today and it definitely takes the cake on bad endings.  I didn't have a problem with the Monster dieing or anything, but the scene after that is what bothered me.  The Baron is taking care of his son and then all the maids feel the sudden urge to bring him wine.  Instead of the Baron giving the wine to Frankenstein he drinks it and starts to flirt around with the maids.  I definitely didn't like that ending, but everything else was good.  I  really  like that The Monster is trying to be human, my favorite scene is when he is throwing flowers in the water and then throws the girl in.    This was the first time I ever saw the actual movie Frankenstein so I never knew the exact tale.  I had always grown up thinking that Frankenstein's assistant was named Egor and that The Monster killed Frankenstein.  Once again I am going to have to investigate into the real story...  That's another book on the 'To-Read' list, it seems to be getting longer and longer.

        10 Things I Love About Dracula   I watched  10 Things I Hate About You  and the original  Dracula  today.  I have always heard good stuff about  10 Things  ever since it came out when I was a wee lad, so I decided to find out for myself.  It was cliche, but it was good.  The ending was beyond predictable, but that didn't bother me.  I love how in depth they got with the clicks (sp?) of high school and the social status of people.  I really liked Heathe Ledger's character because he was the weird transfer kid who everyone is afraid of but he's actually a really nice guy.     Weenies who complain about me ruining movies look away.  Then I got in the way back machine and watched the original  Dracula .  Surprisingly I enjoyed it quite a bit.  It was interesting to see how far we have come in films.  Since this was made just after sound was put into movies the scenes were very quiet.  No music had been put into it.  Luckily when they decided to restore it and put it on DVD they hired a composer to make pieces for the film.  About half-way through the film without the music I realized I was about to go to sleep and my mom already had.  So I put it on the musical version and it was even better.  I've always enjoyed the old horror film stories of Dracula and company (Frankenstein, The Wolf Man, Mummy, etc) so I was really getting into it.  The best performance was definitely the actor who played Rainsfeild, he reminded me so much of Gollum.  He really knew how to catch the light in his eyes to make him look like a raging psycho.  I really want to study up on Dracula and Van Helsing now because at the end John asks Van Helsing if he was coming and Van Helsing replied, 'No, I think I'll stay a while'.  And then in the movie  Van Helsing  there was some unknown past between Dracula and Van Helsing.  I think I'm going to have to investigate.

      Well now I feel really artistic.  I got home today and recieved an email from a guy in Australia who has a website of submitted photographs from mainly Australian photographers.  He emailed me asking if I would like to submit any of my work with a small paragraph explaining what it is and means to me.  He said that they are trying to go global and get people of all races and he wants my help...  This has  really  uplifted my spirits.   urlLink Here  is the site.

      I plugged the old computer in the other night and finally realized how freaking slow computers were in 1998.  So, today I started clearing out the harddrive by deleting programs and written works that were no longer needed.  I discovered that I might have been the cause of the computer to be so slow because I had trillions of random little pieces of work that were absolutely worthless.  I found a wordpad document that didn't have anything in it except a font size of 72.  All I can gather is I opened a program, changed the font, and saved it and it costed us 52 Kilobytes...  There were a few things I found rather funny or worth saving, though.  I found a few poems, some extremely bad and some I like.  Here's a bad one:  Night  Night is when people sleep and those people's breath reap    	 Night is when you can hear an owl and a policeman on his nightly prowl  Night is when the children look under there bed, to make sure there is no monster named Uncle Ted.   These are copied word for word by the way, so the words that don't really seem to make sense, made sense when I was in the 6th grade and trying to rhyme.   Tom 	 Tom the Turkey is his name				 he thinks thanksgiving is a game The hunters go out and search, While Tom hides out in the church.   This one I had to path up some because the file was corrupted, but it's close enough for you to get the idea.  And finally, I found this very very  very  strange story (Remember, the typos are included):   The Easter Bunny, and the Chow-Chow.  "Get your white fur off my territory, rabbit." Said the big dog.  "Chewy, it's me, the Easter Bunny!" The huge fluffy rabbit stated in disbelief.  	 "You're a fraud, you smell funny this year!  You're a fake, I can't tell."  The chow growled loudly.  "Yeah well you don't smell so good yourself." Stated the Easter Bunny.    Chewy started getting up to eat this big rabbit, but the Easter Bunny body slammed the mean dog, and the dog let the Easter Bunny pass, and everyone received toys and candy.  Except the dog.  He received nothing but a bad head ache.   I'm not sure if I was still trying to get over my dog attack around Easter, but I obviously was not a fan of Chow-Chows...  I'll post the ones that I like later.

      I can feel August slowly begining its attack.  We just started July and I'm already dreading August 15th...  August 15th is when the sequel to  Clint Alwahab and the Sorcerer Vaden  starts.  It's going to be a long one too, it doesn't end until May.  Look for  The High School Strikes Back  on August 15th.

      I knew that one day I would have to start shoving off tele-marketers and telling them I don't want any, but I never thought that I would have to start now.  Marvel Comics has now called me twice about the same thing...  I have subscriptions to about three comics and so they send me all kinds of other stuff.  A few weeks ago I received the 'Premiere Edition' of the 'Very First' Marvel shopping catalog.  And nooow I have Marvel people calling me and asking me how I liked the magazine, if I liked anything, what my favorite superheros are and what not...  The first time I thought it was one of my buddies calling me and trying to trick me because immediately the person asked me what my favorite Marvel character was...  I sat there for a minute thinking, 'What kind of a question is that to start a conversation?'  And right before I recieved the second call about the same magazine some random girl pulls up my drive-way (Which is hard to believe because I live in the boonies) and asks where my parents are.  At first I found this extremely scary being home alone with the rain about to start pouring, and then I saw that she was kinda pretty and so I calmed down...  She left when I told her they weren't here, I called my dad and he said that she was a book saleswoman...  Who on God's green earth still sells books door to door other than the old man who has done it his whole life and people buy for courtesy?!  Man, tele-marketing and door to door selling need to be banned from the world so we can all live in peace.

      The Camp High is completely gone and I'm finding it extremely hard to voluntarily read my bible.  I've slowly slipped back into old habits that I said I was cutting.  This is harder than I thought it would be.  It's reeaally hard to not blow some people out of the water with a slew of mean comebacks and strong curse words right now, cause there are quite a few I would like to lay it down on.  I think the fact that I'm in my house all the time and not out socializing or working or doing  something  is causing me to go back into the hole that I was trying to climb out of.  I need to get out of this house.  It's not only the going back to sin thing, but the getting fat and lazy thing...  Seriously, I lost weight last week at camp, and this week I'm gaining it all back with Flips and cookies.  Where's the Chuck Norris Total Gym when you need it?

       Just when I think I'm out they pull me back in.  Seriously if I get another call from a girl that I don't want calling my house there will be such an onslaught of dirty words and voodoo cursings it will make Satan cry.  It may sound a little selfish but my patience for this person dried up a long time ago.  This person, whom we will now name  Lucifer , called me at 9:30 this morning yelling, 'Ha-ha wake up!'.  It's genius and diabolical, but not cool on the recieving end.  So I tell  Lucifer  to never call my house ever again and quickly hang up shaking off the bad mental vibe that  Lucifer  gives off.  Hopefully now that she has had her fun she will stop and I can stop blasting about people noone except the interns at church know.  Peace be upon the rest of the world, I'm going to go listen to some anger music and watch horror films.

          Did you pull this out of your butt?   Spoiler warning: don't read this if you haven't seen the film.   The Village  started off pretty nicely, it had a good, steady plot and was developing the characters nicely.  But once they decided to send Ivy out of the village it started to look a little messy.  And then came the one liner that killed it for me.  "We have the magic rocks, we will be safe!"  Will you smash them up and smoke them later?  I thought it was really good up until she left the village, they could have stayed in the village and totally not gotten into the whole living in modern times but not really thing.  They could have made these monsters real and not costumes under the floorboard.  It could have been a totally different world that we never knew about but instead it had to be modern day and they just couldn't know about it.  It could have been a fight with the monsters but also a fight for Lucius to live because he has been stabbed.  I LOVED Adrien Brody's character, I thought he was awesome and he should have stabbed Lucius.  But having to leave the village, the monsters not being real, the elders being normal people, and magic rocks was just crap.  If M. Night had introduced the 'magic rocks' earlier that line wouldn't have hurt so much but they popped up out of no where and caused that one line to really hit you in the gut.  Some didn't like the monster costume but I saw no problem with it, I liked it.  It's really creepin' me out right now because I'm sitting downstairs in my wooden house in the middle of the woods writing this.  I liked Ivy, I didn't really have a problem with her being able to look people right in the face because she sort of explained that...  I think that Shyamalan got a little caught up in the  Signs  fame and rushed this script so he could get another film out there.  I think he should go into hiding for three years and come back with an incredible script that just holding causes everyone to sod their pants on the spot.  That's what I would do.  Hey, at least the score was good...

         Red Letter Day   The day came. We thought we could get away, But there is no escape from Red Letter Day. We feared it from day one. It sat in the back of our minds But they lined us up and prepared to say, 'Welcome to Red Letter Day'.   Today was get your schedule, books and locker day, aka Red Letter Day.  How depressing does that sound?  It's sounds like we're being shipped off to Aushwitz.  School has pretty much officially begun...  The board is set, the pieces are moving.  P.S. The digital camera is back from it's Brazilian adventure! P.P.S. I got that sweet chess set from Brazil!

      This week is going to be read your butt off week.  Last week of freedom and I have to read about hell.  Then I get to use the book as a guide when I go back next Monday.  Mom gets back from Rio tomorrow, Raina leaves for Boston for the next two years on Monday and Amber is living it up in Charleston, seriously awesome shag-pad style.  I'm really going to miss Raina, she was my relief and my hang out sister for the past two and a half years and now she's leaving for Boston to start a new chapter in her life.  And I have the feeling she's either going to meet a 'special someone' up there, or like it so much that she stays.  This is going to be a tough year.  What really blows my mind is that when she's done with grad. school up there, I will be freaking eighteen.  In just two bloody years I'll be eighteen!  All the older folks reading this are thinking how simple minded I am but for me it's a mind job right now.  Eighteen is that age that you always dreamed about as a kid, you know?  It's that age that every cool person was at when you looked up to them.  This year is going to be interesting.  And I think The Polyphonic Spree's new album is my soundtrack...  That is all.

      I just explored  urlLink The Polyphonic Spree's  website and it is now my favorite website of all time.  It is seriously the best designed website I have ever seen.

             I'm really starting to think  urlLink Darrel  should have been in  The Matrix  trilogy.  Seriously, can't you just see him reaching behind his back to 'stretch' and then what the crap! he's got a sabre, run!

      It is now 4:30 in the freaking morning.  And I'm not tired at all.  I'm watching 'The Early Today'...  I didn't even know this show exists.  Seriously my eyes don't even feel that heavy.  Man, going back to sleeping at 9:30 and waking up at 6 is going to be a serious pain in the butt this year.  I haven't even done anything useful since I've been up.  I wrote a little bit at one, became dissatisfied with it and have been surfing the internet or watching TV ever since.  Crap, I'm starting to get hungry too.  Man, I was hoping to get up tomorrow morning...  Now I'm lucky if I'm going to get up tomorrow afternoon.  The worst thing about being up this early is there's nothing to do.  Especially when you have to be quiet because of family members and you don't have cable.  The only thing I  can  do right now is read, and I'm not really in a reading mood, you know?  I guess I'll go get some pita bread and start reading The Inferno...  I have the feelnig it will be alot like this because being up at 4:30 is hell.  (And you make really bad jokes at 4 in the morning too)

      I watched an old episode of The O.C. yesterday.  I have to admit, I am excited about its return.  I  did  find a few corny lines in it, but what's a teeny bop show without 'em?

        I don't get it.  Why is everyone so fascinated in finding out if Jesus was married?  I just watched the ABC special called 'Jesus, Mary, and Da Vinci'.  The name made me laugh but the topic seems silly to me.  I think everyone is looking for a flaw in Christ so that they can claim Christianity hypocritical.  I don't know enough about the whole 'secret gospels' or secret society of Zion or whatever they called it to argue, but it seems stupid to me to try and prove Christ to be false.  They haven't found facts that he was and what they use as facts aren't complete.  They found old 'gospels' from  other disciples and even Mary.  There was one verse in one of the gospels saying that Jesus would kiss Mary on the---. And there is a hole where it says where he would kiss her.  Dan Brown and others of course are completely convinced that it says 'mouth'.  But they have no clue becuase the word is completely obliterated.  Some people confuse me.

      So evidentally that last entry was total crap because right after I blogged that I wrote an entire episode for my mini series.   And  I just finished an early draft of a short film.  Maybe it's my creative juice-reader that's broken.

      My creativity is now a shriveled up piece of brain.  I have used up all of my creative juices for probably the next two days.  I wrote another episode of my mini series and tried two write a new episode but was completely dissatisfied.  I love writing, but I hate it when I use up my writing cells.  I'm out of writing cells for the day, if not the week.  BLAH BLAH BLAH, BANG.

      I don't think I'll have my pictures from vacation or the mission trip for a while.  My dad just asked me if I wanted to help him today to make some money so I can pay for my pictures.  He specified that the money would be for my pictures.  I said no just because I had other things planned today and I hate it when he pulls a job on me the day it's happening.  Something else to do today is call places and find out when they are hiring for the fall.  I definitely need a job this year.

        Out of all the summer camp pictures from this year, this is definitely my favorite one.  That is the perfect example of what went on every night in our cabin.  Matthew stood on tables and Justin screamed...  Constantly.

      I tried to round up some people to go see  The Bourne Supremacy , but I failed miserably.  I watched The Bourne Identity today and the alternate begining and end.  I am so happy that they edited out both the begining and ending.  The original script is what the movie is now, but before they released it 9/11 happened.  So they wanted to change it around to where everything that happened was just a flashback.  I am so grateful that they did not do that because that would have totally taken away the 'real world' factor and would have made it a stupid/typical action film.

        Late Spring Cleaning  Since I have not developed my photos from vacation and the mission trip, and my mom has the digital camera in Brazil I decided to show some oldies.  I ended up re-organizing my entie My Picture's section of my computer.  In the process I found some really cool ones I never published.  Here are some.                   There you have it.

        I went over to Seth's today to help with Suburban Tumbleweed and ended up having a really good time.  I wasn't really needed for the sound so I didn't have anything to do except help with costumes and script holding...  But then dear Seth treated us all to a trip to Starbucks and gave me a pound of coffee.  Quite excited about opening that puppy up tomorrow.  I also got his pictures from Chicago so now I can publish his insanely beautiful photographs.  I'm going to go watch The Bourne Identity now, in preperation for The Bourne Supremacy.

        Devote yourselves to prayer, being watchful and thankful.  And pray for us, too, that God may proclaim the mystery of Christ, for which I am in chains.  Pray that I may proclaim it clearly, as I should. | Colossians 4:2-4
