						   Well, I have made my decision about going to the hospital. I will call them on June 1st and tell them I need to come in. I want to try to get through this weekend and Memorial Day. William graduates Friday and I want to be there for that. Jim's parents will be here this weekend. We are supposed to go out to dinner Friday before graduation and then to the mall on Saturday so Jim's mom can buy Sara a Bed in a Bag. I also wanted to drive up to Kalkaska and put some flowers on my father's grave since no one ever does. I hate living 2 1/2 hours away. I can't just run to the cemetery and take care of it.    As you can see I am still not sleeping. I went to bed around 11:30pm and was up before 1:00am. It is now 4:30am. I even took two sleeping pills and it has done nothing for me. The voices seem really loud right now. They are saying, "Come on...do it...you know you want to. It would be so easy. Can't you see that everyone would be better without you? You will be at peace". It sort of reminds me of the angel on one shoulder and the devil on the other. Here I am in between the two of them as they are bickering back and forth telling me what would be better. Jim is sleeping on the couch. He told me that if I do go to the hospital he will probably spend most of the nights sleeping on the couch and not our bed.    I am still really angry at dipshit and our son for not informing me last Saturday that they were in an accident. This is about the third or forth time my son has been injured in some way and I was never told until days……sometimes weeks later. I am just his mother. Guess I am not that important. That is what my ex and his family thinks. I was just the carrier for “their” child. Yes I said “their” child because my son’s Omi (German grandma) thinks she is my son’s mother. Hell she has been taking care of him more then my ex ever has. This is just another reason I feel like a failure. The court fucked up yes…but I still blame myself. The guilt kills me. Voices say, “You are so stupid. You always make the wrong decisions. Go for it, give yourself peace.” STOP IT STOP IT STOP IT!!!! GO AWAY!!! STOP TALKING TO ME!!! I WANT THEM TO STOP TALKING!!! Why can’t anyone else hear them? They seem to be screaming. Is this real or is this a dream? Am I really awake or is this a nightmare? It is hard to tell the difference sometimes. The voices say, “Oh come on now….you know this is real. Stop trying to ignore us.”    I need to go.

						   Will I ever be normal? I doubt it. Whatever normal is. Will I always be depressed, anxious, agitated and a worry wart? I am surprised my stomach isn’t full of ulcers. Thank you mother for passing down your worries to me. I am becoming my mother. My mind is always going, thinking….worrying. I have been thinking of someone I shouldn’t be thinking of. I don’t want to admit it. I am home alone with my thoughts. I am thinking about going back to the hospital for awhile. I am starting to hear voices. I didn’t want to tell Jim because I know it would worry him. I am a little scared since I had an uncle with schizophrenia. Jim had mentioned that he had played yahoo pool with a woman that was a bipolar schizophrenic. He was laughing about it and said that when she told him he was like….”Ok….let me get the hell out of here”. How could I tell him my fears? Would he pull away from me and think I am also a freak? When I go to bed and close my eyes I hear these voices telling me to just end it. That is why I probably haven’t been sleeping well. I want to just run in an open field or stand at the top of a mountain and just scream over and over. I think I need the help again. I should be seeing a therapist but I haven’t been. I am sure Jim knows there are things on my mind. I haven’t been myself, whatever that is. I am trying to hang on until June 19th. William’s graduation party is supposed to be that day, we think. I can’t think straight. My thoughts and ideas are in my head one minute and gone the next and I don’t even remember what I was thinking about. The paranoia is getting worse. I am afraid to look outside. I think someone will see me. I want to hide in a cave and stay there in the dark. I don’t want any bad thoughts or things to touch me. Many times I wish I could start my life over. So many things I would do differently. Different choices might have different outcomes. The two things in my life that I would not change are my son Michael and my husband Jim. Those are the only two things in my life that are good. They are the two things that keep me going every day when it would be so easy to just pull the trigger, unscrew the caps and use the knife. I have to keep telling myself that I will get through this day and survive. I am so tired though. Tired of my life being one big struggle. I want to be normal, whatever normal is.  I have my own little world, but it's okay - they know me here. ~Author Unknown
