       urlLink High-Stakes Gambling Invades Private Schools   Wow. Filipinos do love gambling. Anyway, this is bad news when kids who do not even have jobs rake in six-figures debts. I think, as minor myself, they are just looking for thrills that, in someways, they feel they can handle. Gambling can become an addiction and kids, unconciously or conciously, what to experience some high. If your lucky, great! Got some extra cash! If your jinxed, shit! What in the world are you going to do next?  I think the authorities should attack the gambling organizations head-on and not just resort on passive tactics like banning cellphones on schools. If they banned phones, the organization would just keep on going and try to maintain their "business" some other way. And also, it's not just a battle of organizations but also a battle of propaganda. The authorities should be more vocal and active in stomping these groups that take advantage of helpless youths who know no better.

       urlLink De Venecia's Reign is Challenged   Ok, I take back what I said that politics is a melodrama. It'sa freaking basketball game with strategies, game plays, teams, and star palyers. And what's up with all these party changes.  Mga balimbing a pucha!  I guess power can give you friends, friends without loyalty.

       urlLink PJI :: National : Gloria agenda doomed if population program amiss   Now that this mention it, the President didn't mention population! She should have! Having a high rate of population growth, the government should take care of this. I mean, just look at all those children in the schools and streets, would they have jobs when they grow up? the nation is already struggling to give jobs to the millions who do not have one today, what about the future work force? That ten million in the next six years would become far too few to satisfy the growing population.  On the note about the Church and other religious organizations preventing the passing of a bill is just a bunch of bull. What would they do, excommunicate the crongressmen? Come on. Division of Church and State. And the State should be more powerful and we should tremble on its great power. But no. We see it as a play thing, a source of entertainment. A real melodrama.

      Just heard the SONA earlier. Didn't really "watched" it. (I was playing a PC game.) And most of the things she said is what one would expect from the President of the Republic of the Philippines. The call for unity and the fight against corruption. It is a typical speech, which lasted for 40 minutes, but I kinda liked it because she was very concrete, most of the time.   There are many things that she addressed that are out of the ordinary or needs to taken note of. First, she actually said something more concrete on how to fight corruption, like stream-lining the offices and agencies.   Second, she still defended her decision on the hostage crisis if Angelo de la Cruz. She reiterated, however,&nbsp;that she did not pull the humanitarian force out of Iraq because she did not support the US anymore but because she need to protect the people. She still believes and supports the fight against terrorism. I hear you but does that really change the fact that the Philippines pull-out? No.  Third is her continued call for privitization of the ailing NAPOCOR. This has become a real pain for the government who has been paying for the debts and mistakes of this f*cked up corporation. Privitization has been very slow but that is what the President said in her speech. In many ways, I agree with this one.  Fourth, she acknowledges the big budget deficit and has stated her plans to cut down. What she said her here is kind of vague but at least she took notice of the growing problem. She did before but promised little on how to deal with it. Now she has a goal of at least 100 billion pesos as budget and wants the budget to be as high as 180 billion in the coming year. That's a lot of money.   Lastly, She stated her plans for the very talked about government change, which got load roars and cheers. She got a standing ovation&nbsp;just for saying "change of government." She was actually was laughing as the audience&nbsp;clapped and applauded. For the first time, in a very long time, a President actually had the guts to say "change of government" without getting boos. Heck, she actually said it. If such an idea was said say, ten ago, it would crazy. But then again, she does have a majority in both houses of the Congress.  She also thanked the Congress for the accomplishments that she has made thanks to them though there was very little to mention. Some bills here, some bills there. Anyway, that was my impression. She also mentiond some about paying your taxes, *cough* big corporations *cough*. Oh wait, she&nbsp;DID mention big corporations but said it so softly I almost did't hear it. Anyway, this was on of the things she wanted to emphasize that the people do along with being proud of the nation and on being Filipino.   Well, I just hope that for next years, she can keep her promises so that we would have a nation.

      Angelo de la Cruz has returned and the fucking media is not giving him a break. Let the man go home with his family, OK? He'll talk when he wants to talk. He has already been forced to talk on camera, don't choke the poor guy.   Anyway, I have come to a realization on why the government so fervently tried to pursuade the hostage takers. But first, I would like to&nbsp;admit that all this would not have happened if Angelo de la Cruz did not go to Iraq. That is a big might but I would like to see it that way. But why did he go thier in the first place? The answer, there is no job for him here that would sustain his family. And why is there no job for him here? Because of the low credability of the country for investment. And why do we have low credability? Because the government screw up, most of the time. Sure, we have local businesses here (own mostly Chinese-Filipinos and Filipinos with Spanish ancestry) but they are not enough to sustain the people and are mostly based on the urban center known as the NCR. This forces the people to find work on other countries. Ultimately, the government is to blame and I think this is how the government feels. They can't keep the people to stay here that is why they just try to keep them safe on those far-off lands. They already feel concious about their shortcomings so they try to be superheroes to either hide where they failed or, just plainly, try to do the right thing.That's what I think anyway.

      The government is experiencing a backlash of sorts for its decision to pull out of Iraq. I can't blame them to be disappointed. And dealing with terrorists is bad. The government should not have done that. Oh well.  &nbsp; It's just that its hard for the government to alienate a great majority of Filipinos. We feel for Angelo de la Cruz since most of us have OFW's as relatives. If the Coalition forces has just done a better job of curbing the insurgency, all these kidnappings and innocent killings won't happen in the first place. But who can blame them for not doing a good job since they are undermanned and outnumbered in a foreign and unknown culture. That is just my opinion.

      The Philippines is going to pull out its contingent "as soon as possible." The hostage takers then promised to release de la Cruz today. What does this mean? The Philippines gave in to the demands. Spineless move, maybe. But one thing is for sure, there is one Filipino that is NOT dead in Iraq.   This makes a very interesting scenario, the insurgent hostage takers only wanted the soldiers out of the country but what about the Filipino workers? Would the government lift the travel ban on Iraq? Would the insurgents leave the other Filipino workers alone? On the answer to the two questions, I personally think that the answer would be yes on both. Iraq really needs the labor and service that the OFW's of the Philippines provides, especially medical services. And I don't think that the insurgents, and Iraqis general, do not hate Filipinos. The insurgents have so far been very lenient and negotiable with the government. They don't want to kill a Filipino, they just want to weaken the Coalition forces in Iraq. Hopefully, this event would all be over.

       Senator Drilon  and  Senator Villar  are both going to share the Senate Presidential Seat. Power sharing for the Senate Presidency, I don't get it. Why would someone share power? If you are doing a good job, there is no reason to share it with someone else. If the other senators trust you with that position, why compromise with someone else? What's up with that? If you lost the seat because the other senators don't want you to be there anymore, no hard feelings. if you feel that the other person can do better job than let him have it. It's just so confusing. Things could be simpler that way. They make it so complicated.

      Before the hostage crisis, this was the talk of the country. Should we or shouldn't we change the constitution? There has been a resounding  yes  in the Congress and Senate when the President made the call for change. This comes to no suprise since the governement's coalition has the majority in both houses. But there has been stounch opposition to the change.  Senator Drilon  and  Senator Lacson  question's the timing of the change and suggests that the Congress must implement change on the financial situation of the government. I certainly believe them at this point.   The deficit is gargantuan and the tax collection is pathetic. And they want to ride on rough waters with a faulty boat. I really believe that the majority must heed the call of these two senators.  But I do support the change and hopefully it would happen within the next four years. Now another question arises, how will we change the government? Do we become parliamentary or federal? I really don't know what these form could do but these are what I have heard. With a parliamentary form, it would work pretty well with the current multi-party system. While a federal form decentralizes the government and focuses on the local/regional areas that need most of the development. Though they sound really good, we still do not know whether such forms could for us Filipinos.

      The government is in a tight spot. It is torn on its support for the US led Coalition in Iraq and to the Filipino people. Ever since the Angelo de la Cruz was taken hostage, it is trying to do its very best to help de la Cruz, keep safe the Filipinos in Iraq and support the US all in the same time. And they seem that they are having a tough time. Rumors has it that the Philippine contingent won't be continuing its stint in Iraq to appease the Iraqi insurgents. But the government has already denied the demands of the insurgents for an early withdrawal. But of course, the government is not saying anything else. There is currently a total media blackout and the people only has promises from a government that is not known to keep them.

      Hi. I'm Mitch. I'm a nobody who has far too much time in his hands. I would like to talk about Filipino politics and policies. Don't ask me why. I just want. I'm just an ordinary person. I get my info on the news and stuff. But politics touches our lives in our everyday living that it's hard not to take notice of those who call themselves "leaders" of the nation.

       urlLink CNN.com - Arroyo to men: Stop kissing me - Aug 11, 2004   It's weird that CNN would make news article on their website like this one. I mean, come on. I thought this would some nice local news but an international one? Well, it was live anyway.

       urlLink PJI :: National : New tax measures a matter of national survival   I don't know but aren't they supposed to fix the tax collection problem first before imposing new tax laws. We should have to admit that the BIR is one of the most corrupt agencies. I would like to agree with Senator Ralph Recto when he said that we should fix the problem of the BIR since that is the obvious case here. Only a small percentage of the of the GDP was collected in the year 2004, around 9 percent. (My facts are inaccurate) This either shows that the tax collection is not catching up with the growth or the added money (investment0 flowing around the country does not flow through the government. The latter is the reason for imposing taxes. But stream-lining the agencies and tax collection and eliminating corruption should be one of the primary focuses of the government to ensure better budget management.
