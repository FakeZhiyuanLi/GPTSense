      I feel so special that Zach would want me to be a guest blogger.  I'm not a screenwriter, though, so hopefully I won't disappoint.  I kind of liked the idea of our Round Robin script.  Zach, where did it go?

      Listen, do you think I really care what you think?* This is not the place to argue about the definition of "ironic". Talk to my wife, the former editor, I'm sure she cares. Besides, she's wicked skillful with a belt. Me, I'm about to kick ass and take names. I would've fucked you in the ass Saturday, I'll fuck you in the ass next Wednesday instead! Besides, you're all over the line.        Until next time, waste your time with  urlLink this .   Shea Stadium the Radium E M D squared, got kicked out of the Palladium, you think that I cared?   *Note: If I really wanted to start a discussion, do I care that you care? Or do you care that I care? Or do I care that you care that I care? Or do you care that I care that you care? Do I really care? Do you really care? Do we both care but don't care to show it? Did you realize that I have typed care so many times, I'm now questioning whether I misspelled it? Who cares? It's just another four letter word.

      With a title inspired by Carissa's 80's post, I am ready to enjoy this weekend. The stress of studying for a  urlLink test  has passed, and, despite one night of drunken debauchery last week (that included a cigarette!), I still feel the need to kick back and rest on my laurels (and my ass) for a weekend. So, thanks to my lovely wife, I'm staying at the Biltmore Resort this weekend.   This week felt so long, that I thought Wednesday was Friday. This week felt so long, especially after working just three days last week. Yet, here I find myself, at work on Friday afternoon, trying to find little things to do to stay busy instead of leaving early.      Screw it. I'm out. Rock and Roll.

      Lately, Phoenix has been getting me down. I have been telling friends and family that the city has been sucking the soul out of me, which is a legitimate fear I have. I mean, seriously, compare this:      to this:      No comparison, right? Okay, maybe I chose that first picture to illustrate a point, and maybe there are some things I really like about Phoenix (like March), but I'm really beginning to think that there's not much more in this town than what I've seen. And it doesn't help the fact that most of the people I knew in college couldn't wait to hightail it out of here.   I've long talked about moving to Chicago (and that's still on the horizon somewhere), but now I'm beginning to think of even other areas I hadn't considered - Denver, Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, Memphis, Atlanta and Boston, to name a few. However, as much as I want to live in a big city, part of me just wants to pack up and move to Costa Rica and learn to surf, working some carefree job to get some spending money. Then, as soon as I'm picturing this utopian lifestyle, I start think about how hard it would be for me to get back on track after I'm done screwing around. Am I too far along one path to start on another? Did I miss my chance? Can I waste a whole winter bumping chairs and working at a ski area?

      So I was reading through this  urlLink list of great songs  and, while I  urlLink agreed   urlLink with   urlLink a   urlLink number   urlLink of   urlLink them , I was surprised that a  urlLink Phil Collins song  (and a song with which I was not familiar) took the top spot. While reading the explanation of the song, I was reminded of    urlLink American Psycho    and  urlLink Mr. Bateman's musical obsessions .  Anyway, I figured that I should have a similar list, with my own Bateman-esque descriptions, in order to give the reader(s) a little bit of knowledge about me. You'll note that I added the option to pluralize reader, because eventually I might find 3 or even 4 dedicated fans. To be true to Retrocrush, this list represents five of my favorite moments from songs - not a list of favorite songs. I started out with a goal of ten, but this was harder than I thought.   1. Led Zeppelin - What is and What Should Never Be. Besides the fact that Robert Plant sounds like he's singing through water for much of the song, there's a part towards then end where the guitar alternates left speaker/right speaker/left speaker/right speaker. In a small room, it is pretty interesting.   2. Pink Floyd - Wish You Were Here. At the very end, you can hear a breeze. And, if you are listening to the song with my wife, you will hear her impression of the breeze. Highly entertaining.   3. Jurassic 5 - Concrete Schoolyard. The Bill Cosby sample is quite amusing, as is J-5's obsession with spelling out the band name. However, the best part of the song is the verse at the end with a different beat. "I hope you got your shots cuz this is lyrical malaria."  4. Beastie Boys - The New Style and Intergalactic. The Beastie Boys ran out of samples, so they sampled themselves. "And let all the fly skimmies, feel the beat . . . drop." Honorable mention: Get it Together.   5. Rolling Stones - Sympathy for the Devil. I was trying not to repeat any of the selections from the Retrocrush list, but I kept coming back to this song - but a completely separate section. The guitar solo in this song just rips. And it's probably the same notes played over and over. But it is a really great solo.   Thoughts?

      So, I've been gone for a little while. I actually had to work  at  work. I actually clocked 15 hours in my timesheet Wednesday alone (yes, I'm on salary, but I still have to fill out a timesheet) and I think there's a chance I actually  understated  my hours. In the mean time, I picked up some odd jobs around the office and ended up with a pretty decent promotion - so I guess that explains that.      To my loyal (read: occasional, if there's nothing better to do), I'm sorry. I just felt all this pressure to write something interesting, while over on  urlLink Godzilla vs. Peachfuzzerila  my boy  urlLink Marky Mark  is pontificating on some really interesting stuff.   I guess this is turning into an apology and a promise. I'll have some really interesting stuff to say in the future, I promise. And I'm sorry I haven't been more attentive. All I ask in return is that you help finish the script by Effin Sweet. Please. Besides proposing to my wife, it may have been the best idea I've ever come up with - and if you know my wife and me, you'll know that's the truth. And now, for something completely different.

      i'm off to fabulous laughlin, nevada this weekend kiddies.  that's right, all the frivolous money-wasting and ungodly heat of vegas in the summer without any of the glam or glitz.  i plan to thoroughly explore my white trash roots wile there. though i suspect my family would not agree that such roots exist, i like to think that they do.  otherwise, how will i ever relate to my  urlLink boyfriend ?    laughlin does have one thing vegas does not however, and it isn't a plethora of low-end call girls.  after all, i'm sure you could find those somewhere in vegas.  maybe at the  urlLink locals' casinos ???  anyway, laughlin has the colorado river, and we all know that river=semi-drunken boating and country and/or classic rock.  how much more can a girl ask for?    i can't wait.  pass me the  urlLink sb .

      i have developed a new technique of thwarting the new lady's efforts to drive me ABSOLUTELY INSANE!!!  no matter what i am doing... on the phone, playing internet games, blogging, picking my nose, whatever... she will NEVER say "carissa, i need to ask you a question," or "hey can i ask you something?"  she never introduces her presence.  she just stands behind me at my desk waiting for me to notice her.  she will hover there for minutes on end.  i have stopped noticing, or at least acknowledging that i notice her.  it's a standoff now everytime.  when she finally gives in, let me tell you, there is such thing as a stupid question.   new lady (nl):  i have a question about conference calls.  me:  yes?  nl:  how do i make them?  me:  ummm, you call the first person you need, press conference, call the next person & press conference to connect the line.  i think it is in the handbook or something.  nl:  ok so i press conference, then dial the number, then press conference.  then i pick up a new line and press conference?  me:  no, you pick up a line, call the first person, press conference, call the next person, press conference.  then you'll put the call on hold so kevin [her boss] can pick up the line.  nl:  ah i see. so i call the first person, press conference, put them on hold, then call the next person...  me:  no no NO! CALL THE FIRST PERSON.  PRESS CONFERENCE.  CALL THE NEXT PERSON.  PRESS CONFERENCE.  then you will have all the people on the line, put it on hold so kevin can pick up.  nl:  what do you mean so kevin can pick up?  me:  well, aren't you making the call for kevin?  nl:  yes  me:  then i guess he would want to talk to the people on the line?  nl:  yes  me:  well, how would he talk to them unless you put the line on hold so he can pick up? if you are on the line, he can't pick it up.  you guys have the same phone lines.  nl:  i don't get it.   GAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!  *NOTE* the only person who  MAY  appreciate this is karen.  sorry, just had to get it out there.

      ... one must be very careful.  you want to pick something that both people will enjoy, but the level of enjoyment should be scaled to the amount you feel that you like the person and want to continue seeing them.  let me explain. when you see a movie you like in the theater, you will usually remember who you were with when you saw it.  like, i saw "old school" with julie.  she was a perfect match for said movie as we are good friends, have similar senses of humor and will continue to be friends for some time.  now when i think about "old school" i think to myself, "oh yeah, i saw that with julie. i remember how we both really laughed at the part where will farrell says 'i think i see blue.  he looks  glorious !"  now, imagine if i had seen "old school" with some random dude i was on a date with.  someone who i thought was ok, but had no real intention of continuing to see for a long period of time.  everytime i thought about "old school" i would think, "oh i saw that with [insert random dude's name here].  hmm, he didn't really laugh at the parts i thought were funny, like when will farrell kicks the old lady's shopping cart at the end and yells, 'YOU KNOW IT!"    anyway, you are getting the point.  if you are unsure about someone, your best bet is to pick a movie that will be entertaining, but not TOO good.  that way you don't run the risk of the movie being associated with someone who turns out to be terrible/a loser/annoying/bad in bed.  fyi - i will be seeing "the stepford wives" or "the terminal" tomorrow evening.

      i'm trying to figure out what to talk about today.  i couldn't think of anything yesterday, but didn't want to keep my adoriing public waiting for too long!  i'm trying to decide how personal i want to get on here.  after all, i don't know if it is appropriate for you people to know EVERYTHING about me, but one can only be so interesting talking about celebrities and entertainment.  AND... one can hardly be interesting at all talking about politics.  so, shall i entertain you with my weekend (and sometimes weekday) escapades?  or would that be TMI ("too much information" for the internet-acronym-challenged)?

      time to resurrect that age old debate, kiddies.  is kid rock more white trash or more rock star?     i'm gonna have to go rock star.  here's why: there is just something about this man that makes you want to shotgun  urlLink silver bullets  in a concert venue's parking lot.  something about him that begs to have various undergarments tossed at him while he pounds around stage screaming his name.  something about him that makes you want to sway a lighter in the air during a heartfelt rock ballad.  something about him that suggests it would be a good idea to take your top off in broad daylight while you are perched on some drunk stranger's shoulders.  of course all these constitute some decidedly white-trash behavior, but isn't that what being an american is all about?  now the only questions are, why hasn't he sceduled any west coast appearances on his tour AND if/when he does, how do i get backstage passes?

      for the longest time (really about 3 years) i have been asking my self, "self, why did you spend the majority of your youth as a republican?"  i've been racked with guilt.  barely able to live with myself!  today i was reminded of the answer.     urlLink npr  aired a commentary on reagonomics this morning, providing snippets from reagan's inaugural speech in 1980.  reagan made lots of lofty promises to scale back the government and deregulate the economy.  in addition he vowed to cut taxes and curb government spending.  (he did the former but actually upped the latter in the effort to bankrupt the soviet union.)  anyway, i'm going to avoid critiquing the merits of reaganomics, mostly because i have no idea what i am talking about.  what i am going to do is justify my life as a republican for, oh let's say, 11 years.  by the time i got to high school and began to learn what the parties stood for, i really felt fortunate that i actually agreed with the ideologies of the republicans that i had been identifying myself with up until that point. (come on, unless you're alex p. keaton, you just kind of go with the family flow.)  from what i remember, and i won't claim that it is much, repulicans = less government and democrats = more government.  that was the fundamental basic that i remember being pounded into my brain over and over again.  from where i stood, less government sounded great!  i don't want the government telling me what to do after all.  the great fucked up thing about this is the fact that this is not what the parties PRACTICE at all.  i just didn't notice that.  (i was an academic type who dealt more with ideas than reality.)  i guess i kind of feel like the parties hopped in bed with the educational system to pull the wool over my eyes.  today, it is clear that the republicans are not about less government.  much to the contrary.  the fcc is a great example because, of course, it is a matter of national security if i see a little t & a on the boob tube.  if something isn't done, i may not be able to have an abortion... even if i NEED one for medical reasons.  now, i understand that the republicans do support less government when it comes to protecting the environment & meeting the medical needs of the sick/elderly, but who in their right and socially conscious mind could be in favor of such things?  ok i'm sick of typing about this, so i'm not even going to bother wrapping it up and making a nice neat little point.  bottom line, kerry in 2004!

      i will have you all know, that when i am not blogging on my own blog or blogging on someone else's blog, i am trying with all my might to not eat chocolate and/or instant message my (recently) ex boyfriend.  the problem with this is that the inability (due to irreconcilable differences) to IM josh only feeds the need for chocolate.  the endless supply of mini-hershey's and reese's peanut butter cups in the kitchen here doesn't help.    with 4:00pm (the snacking hour) upon me, please provide suggestions as to how i may avoid doing both of the aforementioned offenses.  i cannot do it through  urlLink willpower  alone.

      it started simply enough.  girl meets  urlLink boy .  boy falls for girl.  girl falls for boy due to his adorable sweetness and taste in acting roles.  then it gets complicated.  boy has  urlLink older brother .  older brother happens to be taller and wealthier (though decidedly less talented) than boy.  girl ignores this fact, asserting that she really wants the nice boy, the one who is faithful and contemplative and doesn't have a gambling/alcohol problem.  boy, girl, and older brother hang out at various family functions where girl realizes older brother is actually quite charming in person, not to mention really "effin" hot.  older brother and girl get to talking and girl chastises older brother for being in shitty movies.  (most people would be annoyed by this, but older brother is really insecure and happens to go for women that put him down.  you know, it becomes like a challenge for him to prove himself.)  anyway, older brother is so impressed with girl's cunning wit and discerning taste when it comes to the entertainment industry that he starts to seek her opinion when he is choosing roles.  older brother sends scripts to boy, then manages to call him up for feedback when boy "happens" to be away and girl is there to take the call.  "what did you think" turns into "let's fuck" and... well... how's a girl to resist?  so you see casey, it can never work between us.  your brother has 3.5 inches on you.  what did you expect?

       urlLink  the fact that morrissey is a brit is secondary to the fact that he is a musician. i'm a firm believer that one should not mix music with politics (to this day i can't get the images of bill and hilary dancing to "don't stop" out of my mind.)  bad dancing (a mortal sin, imo) aside, wouldn't it have made more sense if he said he wanted bush to die IN ADDITION to reagan?  morrissey, your name is nearly as cool as my last name, but let's start thinking a bit.  reagan is an old fart.  bush is just a dumb fart.  if it didn't work for the dixe chicks (god bless texas), it's not going to work for morrissey!

      well, i am creating a blog because zach said i should.  he and christy seem to be under the false impression that i have anything interesting to say at all.  i guess we will soon see.  for now, not exactly sure what i should write about.  i'll probably have to think of something really taboo or controversial to talk about a la "the washintonienne" to attract an audience,  but as of yet i have never been paid for sex and do not know of any high powereds that i could expose as freaks.  (i'll get crackin' on that asap.)  so topic-wise, any suggestions from the peanut gallery?  (that's about 2-3 peanuts at this point.)  HELP ME OUT PEOPLE!

      apparently there is no love for the blog anymore.  whatever!  i'll just keep on bloggin' anyway.  this week was particularily heinous.  apparently, my boss can handle only so much before his stress level goes through the roof.  and by "only so much" i mean "not very much."  so, that has pretty much made my work life a living hell.  okay, maybe not hell.  more like purgatory.  like i am stuck in a nothingness of employment, void of any meaning or value.  i get nothing out of it and put pretty much nothing into it.  lovely.  all i have to look forward to is the weekend, and this week i feel like i am too tired to even enjoy that.  what is this world coming to?  maybe all that will change when i am sucking back margaritas (or maybe coronas) at  urlLink cabo cantina   come 7pm, but who can predict such a shift?  all i know is that i have a party to go to on saturday night that may or may not suck.  i'll let you know.

      so i'm convinced that  urlLink sarah mclachlan  may be the best singer i have ever heard.  she seems to have perfect pitch, amazing range and real soul.  she played all of her classic hits and only a few new songs that i didn't recognice.   urlLink butterfly boucher  opened, so that was good cause i like a couple of her songs.  all in all, it was a good, mellow show.  the one complaint i have is that i don't think it should have been an arena show.  a smaller, more intimate venue would have made the show a lot better.

      although it is only tuesday, i'm already fantasizing and longing for the weekend.  actually, to be accurate, i have been doing so since about 9:30am yesterday.  that's right, the week has barely begun, and i'm already jonesing for the weekend.  is there something wrong with me?  i can't help but think that somehow i should enjoy my job a little more than i do.  that is, that i should enjoy my job at all.  do others have such a hard time with working?  am i just a lazy bastard?  what's the deal here?  my dissatisfaction with my job and daydreaming of my time off has my weekends planned out for the next 2 months practically.  that's ridiculous.  but here you go:  july 16-18: cabo cantina, beach, party at frank's july 23-25: san diego july 30- aug 1: laughlin aug 6-8: splash and bash @ lake elsinore aug 11-15: costa rica aug 20-22: scottsdale? aug 27-29: curisosa festival, luau in the oc labor day: rosarito?  anyway, you get the idea.  i have a lot of time to day dream.  i hate work & love summer.

      ok, now i'm off to vegas.  noticing a trend here?  this time i plan on gambling.  i also plan on eating crepes at paris & hitting up the le village champagne brunch.  woo hoo!  i'm pretty excited to watch fireworks from the strip!!  even though it will probably take me 6 hours to do a 3 hour drive, viva las vegas!
