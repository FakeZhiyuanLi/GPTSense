       Which Bitch:  Lyzard  Currently Drinking:  Blue Nun wine  They've all gone to bed. Janet is in Jason's bed. Trenna's on the floor. Kami is on my couch. Liz and the creature are sleeping in my bed... I will be there shortly. Just taking a few minutes to sort out in my brain that some of these people I may never see again.   It's difficult to enjoy time tainted by imminent departure. But I still had a fantastic time. These girls are all very dear to me, each for different reasons. Even the ones I don't know very well, we shared good times tonight and for that I am grateful.    Ah, one of my favorite Bitchfests ever; pretty impressive considering nobody got naked.

       Which Bitch:  Stubby  Currently Drinking: Not a damn thing.   As the night comes to an end, we all shared the porn videos, the sex stories, and the most kinky moments, and yet we are all going to wake up respecting eachother in the morning.. Well at least respecting ourselves.. at least some of us.. lol .  Good Night to all , and to those who wish they were here tonight, that is your sol, you were invited, and decided not to show... now when we all get together to reminisce you will be there wondering why you didn't show up.. he he he

       Which Bitch:  Lyzard  Currently Drinking:  Blue Nun Wine  Everyone else is sleepy. I am wide awake and slightly buzzed... but not intoxicated yet. But all these assholes are spent. God I hate being the only one left sober and wide awake.   I bought a toy in Evanston... it's fantastic, except the off button doesn't appear to work very well... it took ten minutes for five of us to figure out how to make it stop. Even after removing the batteries, when you put them back in it just keeps going. That could cause a problem, a very good problem.

       Which Bitch:  Sweet Lips  Currently Drinking:  Rum & Coke I just got into an argument with my bestfriend. He is so annoying. I think he was jealous that he was not invited. Oh well..he is a bitch but not a true BITCH!  I am so glad that I don't like guys, GIRLS are so much better.

       Which Bitch:  Lyzard (aka The Wood-meister)  Currently Drinking:  Rum & Vanilla Pepsi  According to the Oz Prison Bitch Name Generator, my Prison Bitch name is "The Wood-Meister." Only had one shot plus this drink... things are just beginning. And already Kami (aka Cum Bucket) has claimed my ass and Liz (aka Fuck Stick) has claimed my rack - but is willing to share.   Kami wanted to clarify that she is not willing to share my ass - she's latching on like a leech.

      This is probably the last Bitchfest post. I finally got around to posting some pics from Bitchfest. A few of the bitches in attendance want to know why nobody has commented on anything. Perhaps you consider it inappropriate, fuck that! Comment away!  Much love, Lyzard
