      I hate Live Journals, I think they're dumb, so I feel a little dirty having a blog which is basically a Live Journal given a name so it doesn't sound so dirty. Personally I feel that Live Journals tend to be not as well formatted as blogs, so I guess blogs are a little better. But in essence the basic prinicple of me posting small details about my life for some reason is the same. Anyway I'd like to post some progress I'm making on certain projects.  &nbsp;   J. Rabbit   in   Animatics -Play  Progress- Basically 12.5% of the writing is&nbsp;finished, it's a short play that will probably be forty pages.&nbsp;I have about five pages done right now, five pages I'm not really happy with. The storytelling is original but might be a tad confusing. I've been trying to get myself to sit down and finish it, but that is unlikely. I can't be messing around, right now this play isn't going to be a contest winner, and I need a contest winner.  Current Concept-Animator of a webtoon has a love/hate with his cartoon and a voice actress he works with, leading up to the questioning of his own nature.  &nbsp;   Millerville #1 -Comic Book  Progress-Don't have a lot done, let's just say that. But I have time, the artist still has to do character designs.  Current Conept-Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. It's confusing.  &nbsp;   Drull&nbsp;the Conqueror/Reasonable View- Special Project  Progress-Only in conception.  Current Concept-Weekly updates of abstract views on our wonderful world by mwah. I also had an idea of making part of the site be about Drull the Conqueror who is an evil guy who conquers things... like Ikea.  &nbsp;   Geert Comiks -Ashley Hill's comic strip that I wrote  Progress-On Hold  Current Concept-I have a whole bunch of stock scripts Ashley never wrote, mostly dealing with the main character Geert's last day of school. There was going to be a massive story arc where Geert and his friend Harvey go on a road trip which involved them being arrested in Texas and such. However Geert was my first comic, and I've grown since I wrote my original strips. The next comic strips that I will eventually write and Ash will eventually draw will be more dark, realistic, and dark. While being funny I plan for the main character to have to deal with homelessness amongst other things.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I really do have a lot of stuff flowing around my head, not all of it creative.&nbsp;I have to enter some writing contests and I also have to call the Improv tomorrow because I need a job (I'm not a comedian but they pay people to sell tickets on the street. This girl who was selling them told me they pay well).  &nbsp;  Anyway this was fun, I'll post here more often.
