       urlLink    You'll find gondolas and gondoliers throughout the main tourist areas, from Tronchetto and the Piazzale Roma (where motorists park their cars) to the Rialto Bridge area, the Doge's Palace, and busy pedestrian crossings along the secondary canals. Chances are, you'll encounter men who politely ask "Gondola?" as you walk past the flotillas of parked boats

       urlLink    The city of Venice sets official rates for gondola rides, which start at 62 for 50 minutes. Additional 25-minute increments are 31. After 8 p.m., the base rate goes up to 77.50. (Up to six people can share a boat without paying a supplement.)

       urlLink    There are two important rules to remember about gondola rides in Venice: 1) If the price bothers you, don't do it. 2) If the price doesn't bother you, make sure you understood the gondolier correctly. Fact is, a gondola ride is like a hansom cab ride in New York City: It can be a delightful experience, but only if you're able to forget the price and focus on the scenery.

       urlLink    The city does have its share of problems, too. It is, famously, sinking -- and no one can agree on what should be done about it. Venice draws as many as 200,000 visitors a day, but the resident population has declined to less than 70,000. Many young people have moved to the mainland, where rents and real-estate prices are lower. (To minimize visitor waits at various attractions during peak summer and holiday periods, the city has introduced a multipurpose tourist pass known as the Venice Card.) Parts of downtown are dirty and run-down -- and rather smelly in summer heat. People can be brusque. And the prices of virtually everything smack of highway robbery. Even so, it remains a treasure to be savored -- and not just by lovers.

       urlLink    Set on islands connected by bridges, Venice's main street -- the Grand Canal -- is traversed by an assortment of watercraft, from rowboats and waterbuses to yachts and cargo vessels. During Carnevale (10 days in late February or March), its waterfront is lit by torches at night as colorfully masked and costumed revelers overrun the city's ancient palaces and public squares.

       urlLink    Everywhere you look in Venice there's an archetypal romantic scene: a short bridge arching over a canal, a gondola gliding by, the moon reflecting off the water. Its winding, narrow streets can be eerily quiet and mysterious, particularly on a foggy night. Without a city's usual traffic noise, you can hear the laughter of children from your window as well as the mysterious sound of footsteps seemingly just around the corner.

       urlLink    Karol Józef Wojtyla , known as John Paul II since his October 1978 election to the papacy, was born in Wadowice, a small city 50 kilometres from Cracow, on May 18, 1920. He was the second of two sons born to Karol Wojtyla and Emilia Kaczorowska. His mother died in 1929. His eldest brother Edmund, a doctor, died in 1932 and his father, a non-commissioned army officer died in 1941.  He made his First Holy Communion at age 9 and was confirmed at 18. Upon graduation from Marcin Wadowita high school in Wadowice, he enrolled in Cracow's Jagiellonian University in 1938 and in a school for drama. The Nazi occupation forces closed the university in 1939 and young Karol had to work in a quarry (1940-1944) and then in the Solvay chemical factory to earn his living and to avoid being deported to Germany. In 1942, aware of his call to the priesthood, he began courses in the clandestine seminary of Cracow, run by Cardinal Adam Stefan Sapieha, archbishop of Cracow. At the same time, Karol Wojtyla was one of the pioneers of the "Rhapsodic Theatre," also clandestine. After the Second World War, he continued his studies in the major seminary of Cracow, once it had re-opened, and in the faculty of theology of the Jagiellonian University, until his priestly ordination in Cracow on November 1, 1946.

       urlLink    Popes in their secular role ruled portions of the Italian peninsula for more than a thousand years until the mid 19th century, when many of the Papal States were seized by the newly united Kingdom of Italy. In 1870, the pope's holdings were further circumscribed when Rome itself was annexed. Disputes between a series of "prisoner" popes and Italy were resolved in 1929 by three Lateran Treaties, which established the independent state of Vatican City and granted Roman Catholicism special status in Italy. In 1984, a concordat between the Holy See and Italy modified certain of the earlier treaty provisions, including the primacy of Roman Catholicism as the Italian state religion. Present concerns of the Holy See include religious freedom, international development, the Middle East, terrorism, the failing health of Pope John Paul II, interreligious dialogue and reconciliation, and the application of church doctrine in an era of rapid change and globalization. About 1 billion people worldwide profess the Catholic faith.

       urlLink    The Colosseum - the greatest amphitheatre   of the antiquity - was built in Rome, Italy, about 1920 years ago. It is considered an architectural and engineering wonder, and remains as a standing proof of both the grandeur and the cruelty of the Roman world. After the splendour of imperial times, the Colosseum was abandoned, and in turn it became a fortress for the medieval clans of the city, a source of building materials, a picturesque scenery for painters, a place of Christian worship. Today it is a challenge for the archaeologists and a scenario for events and shows.

       urlLink    PIAZZA VENEZIA The building of this great monument roused in this century numerous controversies and it is often mentioned as an example of an architectural ruin. The reason for this hostile attitude is that during its building the context was not considered in which the monument had to be erected, that is very near to the Capitol, Roman Forum, even Coliseum, the heart of Rome. This location should have been honored through architectural choices that respected the context; it was not so, from a stylistic point of view, and most of all because of the dimensions. It's quite impressive to go from the proportions of Capitol Square, built for the measure of a man, to the Monument in memory of Vittorio Emanuele, which always gives the idea that human measures are too little.

Therefore, three relevant excavation areas have been opened in the areas of the Forum of Caesar  , the Templum Pacis or so-called Temple of Peace (Forum of Vespasian),   and finally the Forum of Trajan  , which all include a comprehensive extension of 15,000 square meters, certainly the largest urban excavation project ever realized.

The most important among the various forums that compose the set is Trajan's Forum, built by Trajan himself to celebrate the Roman victory in Dacha in 105 A. D.; the work was entrusted to Apollodoro from Damascus. In order to carry out the work he didn't hesitate to fulfil the partial excavation of Quirinal Hill, and consequently Trajan's Markets were built, that take place following the steep ground of the hill. Within the Trajan's Forum, the Trajan's Column is placed, that represents through its figures the Roman deeds during Dacha war

The birth of the Imperial Forums marks the passage from republic to empire; following the example of Julius Caesar who built the first forum of the set in 46 b. C., all the most important Roman emperors wanted to leave their sign building a forum called after their name.

       urlLink    The most famous fountain in Rome, built by the architect Salvi who made it in 1735 under Clemente II's pontificate. The sculptures that compose it tell about various events linked to the discovery of the spring itself which the water that feeds the fountain comes from. In the middle of the monumental set, that takes place on the façade of a palace, there is the statue of Ocean, represented on a chariot shell shaped, carried by winged horses. You can see then among the other sculptures, the figures of tritons and sea-animals, mythological or real.  The little square is probably the place most crowded of visitors you can see in Rome, tens of thousands of visitors that every day visit the work to throw into the basin a coin, that, as the legend tells, guarantees the tourist to come back to Rome in his lifetime.  The world-wide fame of this fountain was given also by the scenes of the famous movie "La dolce vita" by Federico Fellini.

       urlLink    The Tower of Pisa is the bell tower of the Cathedral. Its construction began in the august of 1173 and continued (with two long interruptions) for about two hundred years, in full fidelity to the original project, whose architect is still uncertain. In the past it was widely believed that the inclination of the Tower was part of the project ever since its beginning, but now we know that it is not so. The Tower was designed to be "vertical" (and even if it did not lean it would still be one of the most remarkable bell towers in Europe), and started to incline during its construction. Both because of its inclination, and its beauty, from 1173 up to the present the Tower has been the object of very special attention. During its construction efforts were made to halt the incipient inclination through the use of special construction devices; later colums and other damaged parts were substituted in more than one occasion; today, interventions are being carried out within the sub-soil in order to significantly reduce the inclination and to make sure that Tower will have a long life. In all this story it is possible to find a meaningful constant, the "genetic code" of the Tower: its continual interaction with the soil on which it was built. Today's (1999) works for the safeguard and the conservation of the Tower with very advanced methodologies are designed to fully respect this constant.

The Museo di San Matteo contains art by local artists and others, including the Pisano family, Fra Angelico and Brueghel.

       urlLink    Pisa's principal tourist attractions are grouped together in the Campo dei Miracoli, the Field of Miracles. It's hard to believe the place is real; the tourists flocking around are the only thing that gives the surreal scene a touch of reality. The setting is a flat space, green with lawns, at the edge of the town centre. Here rise the town's cluster of monuments, all architecturally exquisite, and all leaning at different angles. There is a grand Romanesque cathedral, a large striped baptistry, and, of course, the Leaning Tower. Also in the Campo dei Miracoli, another curious sight is the Campo Santo, the Holy Field. This is a cloistered cemetery, said to have been laid with earth brought back from the Holy Land by the Crusaders. Bombing in the Second World War destroyed some of the works of art that were stored in the surrounding buildings; some frescoes remain, however. In the same area are two museums, the Museo del Duomo (cathedral museum) and the Museo delle Sinopie, which contain art and sculpture from the monuments.

Standing at almost 85 metres / 275 feet high, it was built so that the town bells could be heard far and wide, to announce mass, celebrations or at times, to warn of impending danger.

       urlLink    Florence is one of the most beautiful cities in the world; for many people, it is the most splendid. Its palaces, churches and museums overflow with masterful paintings and sculpture. As the birthplace of the Renaissance, the city combines unequaled beauty with centuries of history in a heady mix. Your first glimpse of the Duomo, set incongruously in the midst of streaming traffic, is likely to take your breath away. The spirits of Da Vinci, Dante, Boccaccio, Michelangelo and the Medicis are palpable on virtually any street, and the days of the Renaissance seem close at hand.

       urlLink    The building of Santa Croce basilica began in 1294. Giotto's frescoes in the chapels at the head of the transept are considered to be some of the finest examples of fourteenth-century painting, while the architect Matas is responsible for the church's distinctive green and white marble façade. The church contains funeral monuments to intellectual, moral and religious figures from Italy's past, including Michelangelo, Machiavelli, Gioacchino Rossini, Galileo and Ugo Foscolo. Although exiled from Florence and buried in Ravenna, Dante, father of the Italian language, is honoured with a cenotaph

       urlLink    Renowned for its panoramic views of Florence and the Arno valley, this terrace is a popular spot with locals and tourists. Created as part of major restructuring of the city walls, Poggi's sumptuous terrace is typically 19th century. In 1871, Poggi designed a monument base dedicated to Michelangelo. The monument itself was to be composed of copies of Michelangelo's works, including David and the Medici chapel sculptures from San Lorenzo. When the terrace was finished, Poggi designed the hillside building, now a restaurant, as a museum for Michelangelo's works.

       urlLink    Ponte Vecchio (Old Bridge) Built in 1345, the Ponte Vecchio is the oldest bridge in Florence and spans the River Arno. This three-arched bridge was the only one in the city to survive the bombings in World War II, and is lined with shops, mainly gold and silversmiths, making this a popular shopping area. Some of the shops have workshops at the back which literally overhang the river and are supported by large wooden rests. There is a secret passageway high above the shops, the Corrodoio Vasariano, that links the Uffizi Gallery to the Pitti Palace, that was originally built so that the wealthy Medici family could walk into town in private. It has recently been reopened to the public and is now lined with portraits of some of the city's greatest artists.

						    urlLink    Background Once the center of power for the large Austro-Hungarian Empire, Austria was reduced to a small republic after its defeat in World War I. Following annexation by Nazi Germany in 1938 and subsequent occupation by the victorious Allies in 1945, Austria's status remained unclear for a decade. A State Treaty signed in 1955 ended the occupation, recognized Austria's independence, and forbade unification with Germany. A constitutional law that same year declared the country's "perpetual neutrality" as a condition for Soviet military withdrawal. Following the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991 and Austria's entry into the European Union in 1995, some Austrian's have called into question this neutrality. A prosperous, democratic country, Austria entered the European Monetary Union in 1999 Location Central Europe, north of Italy and Slovenia  Area: total: 83,870 sq km  water: 1,426 sq km  land: 82,444 sq km  Population: 8,174,762 (July 2004 est.)  Ethnic groups German 88.5%, indigenous minorities 1.5% (includes Croatians, Slovenes, Hungarians, Czechs, Slovaks, Roma), recent immigrant groups 10% (includes Turks, Bosnians, Serbians, Croatians) (2001)  Religions: Roman Catholic 74%, Protestant 5%, Muslim 4%, other 17% Languages: German (official nationwide), Slovene (official in Carinthia), Croatian (official in Burgenland), Hungarian (official in Burgenland)

						    urlLink    Vast "Heldenplatz" (spare of heroes), situated next to it, is very impressive, too. Equestrian statues of Archduke Karl, who won the battle of Aspern against Napoleon's troops (1809), and Prince Eugene of Savoy, who defeated the Turks, attest to Austria's glorious past. "Heldenplatz" is more than a square, it is one of Austria's symbols of national identity.

						    urlLink    The Hofburg was extended to a magnificent residence when the Habsburg's power increased. That's why one can find almost any architectural style, from gothic to art nouveau. Nowadays this enormous complex is home to "Österreichische Nationalbibliothek" (National Library), "Schatzkammer" (Imperial Treasury), and houses a collection of musical instruments, another collection of weapons, a "Museum für Völkerkunde" (Museum of Ethnography) and famous "Spanische Hofreitschule  " (Spanish Riding School  ).

       urlLink    Background: Switzerland's independence and neutrality have long been honored by the major European powers, and Switzerland was not involved in either of the two World Wars. The political and economic integration of Europe over the past half century, as well as Switzerland's role in many UN and international organizations, has strengthened Switzerland's ties with its neighbors. However, the country did not officially become a UN member until 2002. Switzerland remains active in many UN and international organizations, but retains a strong commitment to neutrality.  Location: Central Europe, east of France, north of Italy  Ethnic groups: German 65%, French 18%, Italian 10%, Romansch 1%, other 6% Religions: Roman Catholic 46.1%, Protestant 40%, other 5%, none 8.9% (1990)  Languages: German (official) 63.7%, French (official) 19.2%, Italian (official) 7.6%, Romansch (official) 0.6%, other 8.9%  Capital: Bern  Economy - overview: Switzerland is a prosperous and stable modern market economy with low unemployment, a highly skilled labor force, and a per capita GDP larger than that of the big Western European economies. The Swiss in recent years have brought their economic practices largely into conformity with the EU's to enhance their international competitiveness. Switzerland remains a safe haven for investors, because it has maintained a degree of bank secrecy and has kept up the franc's long-term external value. Reflecting the anemic economic conditions of Europe, GDP growth dropped in 2001 to about 0.8%, to 0.2% in 2002, and to -0.3% in 2003.

       urlLink    Fraumünster Church Founded in 853 by King Louis the German, this church with ist convent was inhabited by the female members of the aristocracy of southern Germany. It enjoyed the patronage of kings and the right to mint coins in Zürich until well into the 13th century. Ownership of the church and convent passed to the city of Zürich after the Reformation. Important architectural features include the Romanesque choir and the high vaulted transept. The nave was last renovated in 1911, following on from work to heighten the north tower and remove the south tower in the 18th century. In addition to the largest organ in the canton (5,793 pipes), its most stunning jewels are the stained glass windows: those in the north transept are by Alberto Giacometti's cousin, Augusto (1945), the five-part cycle in the choir (1970) and the rosette in teh southern transept (1978) are by Marc Chagall. There is a series of frescos by Paul Bodmer in the cloister to mark the founding of the Fraumünster.

       urlLink    Zurich lies situated on both shores of the Limmat River, which flows from the northern end of Lake Zurich. The Sihl River, a tributary of the Limmat, also flows through the city, and quays line the riverbanks and the lake. The city spreads across a ravine in the eastern hills between the wooded slopes of the Züürichberg and Kääferberg hills into the Glatt River valley.

       urlLink    Grossmünster church According to legend, Charlemagne discovered the graves of the city's martyrs Felix and Regula and had a church build as a choristers' cloister on the spot. Construction work on the present building began around 1100. In the first half of the 16th century the Grossmünster was the starting point of the Swiss-German Reformation led by Huldrych Zwingli and Heinrich Bullinger. The theological college then annexed to the cloister became the germinal cell of what is now the University of Zürich. Worth visiting: Romanesque crypt, Romanesque capitals in the church and cloister. Choir window by Augusto Giacometti (1932), bronze doors by Otto Münch (1935 and 1950), Reformation Museum in the cloister.

In 1891, it was transferred to the "Rade", to become a major tourist attraction. However, it was not until 1947 that it was provided with an autonomous pumping station, propelling 500 liters of water per second to a height of 140 meters at a speed of 200 km per hour. Eight 13,500-watt projectors light the fountain's majestic column in the evening as it soars skywards, from early March until the second Sunday of October
