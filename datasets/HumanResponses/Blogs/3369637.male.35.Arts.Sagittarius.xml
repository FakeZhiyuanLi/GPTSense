      Yeah, it's only been a few hours since my first post here, but then, I told you I have OCD, right? It's just that I think this blogging thing could be something really good for me, and I must admit I'm excited to see how it will develop.  Looking back over my debut post, I realize there are some holes. I mentioned that I'd been living in basements until very recently; that was due to my wife and I separating in January. Before then, she and I lived comfortably in a nice, quiet eastside neighborhood in a house of our own (thanks in no small part to the kindness of her parents) with a dog or two and my cat Largo.  My wife, Frida, is the gentlest, sweetest girl I have ever known. She's also strikingly beautiful, a full-blooded Cubana with long black hair, brown eyes and a shapely form. Do I love her? Of course. And I know she loves me, too, in a way she's never loved anyone else. But our marriage just wasn't to be. They say, "All's fair in love and war," and I guess it's true that both are equally cruel, as well.  I certainly had my problems with Frida's habits and idiosyncrasies — which I won't go into here — and they caused me great stress. But I can only  imagine  how much of a pain in the ass it must have been for her to be married to  me.  My mercurial nature is a hassle even to  me,  and I  am  me. Frida, though, is a saint in that way; she almost never complained about me, and even when she did (invariably after many drinks), it was usually well-deserved. She would have let me get away with murder. It all ended not in a bang but a whimper; we argued only very, very rarely, and when it came to splitting up, things were no different.  We were married on a Friday the 13th, at a historic vaudeville theatre downtown, under a full moon. Literally hundreds of guests attended, and even a number of our uber-jaded Gen-X friends (long since disillusioned with such outmoded institutions as marriage) confided that our marriage rekindled a kind of lost hope in their hearts. The crowd was a wild mix of artists, bikers, musicians, surgeons, potheads, slackers, politicians, mariachis, filmmakers, Cubans, retirees, barflies, dropouts, academics, hippies, punks and homosexuals. (The gay contingent was well-represented: Frida's "maid of honor" was Don Davis, a dear friend and well-known HIV/AIDS activist who has since passed away; because Frida's mother was 40 minutes late for the ceremony, the bride got laced into her dress with help from our beefcake-crazy friend Frank, whose name is tattooed on my ankle.)  Due to the lateness of the proceedings, most of the attendees hit the open bar before the ceremony even took place, so everyone was good and lit by the time everything went down. Our officiant was Dan Crane, one of my very best friends (and near-constant musical co-conspirator), who, like me, is ordained (via internet) by the Universal Life Church of Modesto, California. After the drinking, dancing, gluttony and laughter subsided, we stayed overnight in a hotel, then left the following morning for the airport. I had never been on an airplane in my life (at over 30 years of age, no less!). We flew to New York City (via O'Hare in Chicago) and stayed nine days. We had the time of our lives.  (A funny side note: my best man, Clark, in town for the wedding, and I drove over to my pot dealer's house in our tuxedoes before the ceremony. We were looking to get a little sack of weed, but walked right in on the dude and his dad smoking opium. We helped ourselves to a couple puffs of the sweet smoke, made a deal and drove back to the theater to wait for the shindig to kick off. I must say, I was very relaxed in the middle of the chaos.)  Anyhow, after the honeymoon was over, we had our ups and downs, but for a while, we were really pretty happy. Then I spiraled into one of my bouts with black depression. Usually I just kind of steel myself as best as I can and grit my teeth through these periods. But this time, I had health insurance, thanks to Frida's job. So I went to a psychiatrist.  Wait, that's not exactly right. Let me back up...this is the story of the meds, and it's important that I get the details as straight as I can.  I went first to my Primary Care Provider, the general practitioner assigned to me by our health insurance plan. I'm not sure why I was even there; maybe I was ill, or had hurt myself or something. At any rate, during my brief conversation with the doctor, somehow I ended up mentioning having been previously diagnosed with OCD. The second it came out of my mouth, I saw the doctor's face light up. He wrote me a scrip on the spot for Paxil, and gave me a bag full of sample doses. Without any evidence other than my offhand comment, he put me on this powerful, brain-scrambling medicine.  Not long after I started my Paxil regimen, I began seeing the psychiatrist. He was a man probably around 50, bearded and bespectacled, as suits a shrink. His office was cluttered with books, papers and many small pieces of African art. I was not at all well at the time; my head was filled with horrible static. I was despondent, unresponsive, remote. I had just lost a decent-enough job by simply not showing up for several days. The shrink later told me (when he considered me "improved") that he had almost suggested that I be hospitalized when I first saw him.  He switched me from Paxil, which kept me in a state of near-panic, extreme paranoia and sleeplessness, to Zoloft. Both of these drugs are "selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors" or SSRIs. Both had roughly the same effect on me, though the Zoloft had the additional side effect of keeping me from getting an erection. The shrink switched me to a cocktail of Wellbutrin (an SDRI, which selectively inhibits the reuptake of dopamine in the brain) and Depakote (prescribed usually for mania and seizures); the former was intended to deal with the depression (the shrink gave up on the OCD, considering the depression a much more serious issue), the latter to counteract the "up" effect of the Wellbutrin.  For the next few months, I lived in a bubble. I experienced no highs, no lows. I was dissociated from the world around me, looking at it through a soft-focus lens. Though I'll admit I was no longer depressed, I was no longer  anything.  (I also gained back the 40 pounds that I had worked very hard to lose the year before.) Honestly, I can hardly remember anything that happened to me during that period — except the events of September 11.  I was on my annual week-long camping trip at the  urlLink Walnut Valley Festival  in Winfield, Kansas when it happened. I woke up around ten in the morning, crawled out of my tent and hit the port-a-potty. On returning to my campsite, my friend Shel gestured to his radio. "Listen to this," he urged.  "The Pentagon is still burning," was the first thing I heard that day. By day's end, when a station wagon made the rounds through the campgrounds selling EXTRA editions of the Wichita Eagle (the nearest major newspaper), I'd heard not too much more; while people all over the world sat glued to their television sets watching the horrific footage of airplanes crashing into the World Trade Center, I sat in a pecan grove listening to an AM radio. It would be five full days before I saw any television at all.  Most importantly to me on a personal level, though, was that I became aware during the aftermath of the attacks that I  had  to get off the fucking meds ASAP. I mean, I'm a news junkie. Politics is in my blood. The heaviest single event of my life happened on 9/11, and I felt  nothing.  I quit taking the pills shortly thereafter. The many side- and after-effects of the meds plague me to this day, well over two years later.  I'm tired now...I'll write more tomorrow. If anybody's reading this thing, feel free to join the blog and leave comments. Until then...  Brannigan

      Welcome to Green Sky Journal. My name's Patrick Brannigan, and this blog is more or less my alternative to therapy, which so far has never been of much use to me.   As you may have read in my profile, I'm a 35-year-old manic-depressive with OCD, going through my second divorce. I have been largely jobless for a year now, and recently moved into a Skid Row apartment with my cat, Largo. At this writing, I have roughly $13 in a credit union account, less than $2 in my pocket, my car is running on fumes and I have no idea how I'm going to pay the rent in a couple of weeks.   As crappy as all this might sound, I'm honestly doing reasonably well. Until a few weeks ago, I was living in the basements of friends' houses; I was never comfortable, never really felt "at home" — you can imagine. To avoid the basements, I spent all my time hanging out at the Troubador Club, an upscale bar/coffeehouse down in an old section of town that's currently going through a spurt of gentrification.   Now that I've got my own apartment (just down the street from the Troub, actually), I feel better. My new place was a disgusting, filthy dump when I first got the key; the whole sad building, a nice apartment house when built in the 1920s, is in fact a hovel, and the landlord doesn't seem to care at all. The fluorescent lights on the second floor have been burned out the entire time I've been here, and the windows overlooking the second- and third-floor fire escapes are both broken. Other tenants have told me of break-ins and meth labs in the building; my own heavy apartment door has obviously been kicked in before. (I installed double dead bolts before moving any of my stuff in.) But after much, much, much cleaning and painting, the place feels like home to me. A few little spruce-ups remain to be done, but on the whole, it's reasonably nice now.   The job search has been taking up a lot of my time recently. This time last year, I was the well-paid managing editor of a free weekly alternative newspaper,  Coriolis.  My position at  Coriolis  was absolutely the best job I have ever had, hands down. In fact, it holds the distinction of being the  only  job I  ever  actually liked for longer than about two weeks. I am notoriously unsatisfied by nine-to-five jobs; though I'm usually hired in some creative capacity, most employers do not seem to understand that "creative types" don't often work well within a rigid work environment. Steve, the publisher of  Coriolis,  recognized my bipolar nature and allowed me to work on my own schedule. He gave me nearly unlimited free reign in my editorial writing, and never imposed himself as an authoritarian, which I'm sure he knew would chafe me. When the paper ran into money trouble last summer, and paychecks stopped coming, it was the only time in my life I was crushed by losing a job.   I kept on at the office, though, until October, when I finally found another line of work: driving a taxi. That was a terrible, unlucrative job, but an interesting experience. I worked 60- and 72-hour weeks, 12-hour shifts, and in the end averaged about $2.74 per hour. I finally bailed out because it was wearing me out physically and mentally, and I had nothing to show for it once I paid for the cab rental ($360/week), gasoline, car washes, etc. I continued contributing to  Coriolis  on a sporadic basis; the company eventually re-organized itself, and still publishes weekly, but salaries are out of the question for the time being. It gets better all the time, though, so hopefully, I can one day resume my post there. In the meantime, however, the times are indeed mean.   It's funny...for years I worked very hard to be a professional musician; I assumed naively that my efforts would eventually come to fruition. So many nights I spent singing my lungs out in dark, smoky nightclubs, still wearing the work shirt I had on all day on the job. Sometimes the crowds were huge, sometimes no one showed. Either way, the equipment had to be broken down in the sweat-soaked aftermath of two in the morning, loaded up and hauled away across the lonesome, silent streets. The show is never as much work as the booking, promotion, rehearsal, schlepping heavy amps and so on — but we did it because we meant it. No matter which band I played in, we were always sincere, always burning for recognition, for success. But it never came — not for me, at least.   I dropped out of the music scene for a while when I started publishing my own local free tabloid in late 1997; I didn't want there to be a conflict of interest between my paper and the scene it was covering, and besides, the drummer of the band I was in at the time moved off to Omaha, a long drive away from here. It was as good a time as any to go on hiatus from performing. That was more than six years ago, and though the paper — entitled  Local Rag  — is now long-dead, I still haven't gotten back into the swing of gigging. I've done a handful of solo acoustic shows, a few gigs with a reorganized version of the Wheaties (my first "real" band), and a few more with my short-lived backup band, Dogpile. Many people who have become acquainted with me within the past few years have no idea that I am a musician.   I must admit, that doesn't sit well with me, but on the other hand, I'm in no position to complain about it. All I've got to do is start another band, right? But then, that requires me to bail my guitar out of the pawn shop (again), buy an amplifier, find some other players who are into it (and who aren't already constantly booked with their existing bands), and so on. What with trying to keep food on the table and all, it seems a lot harder than it used to. Maybe I'm getting old.   At any rate, I haven't been able to write new songs as of late. I pull out a decent one every now and then, but it's not like in the old days, when I could write a couple good tunes before breakfast on most any given day. A lot of things have changed inside me since I was dosed with a series of prescription antidepressants back in 2001, and I think this inhibition of my creativity is part of the fallout from that whole sorry episode. I believe those pills really seriously damaged me permanently, but that's a story for another day.   I guess this is enough meandering for one sitting. Tomorrow I'll go in and open my friend Dag's tattoo shop for him; he's been paying me a pittance to help out with customers, answer the phones, etc. Right now he's in Europe at a tattoo convention, so I'm minding the store in his absence. He's a fucking great guy, and I really want to do right by him, as he's saved me from being totally broke this past month or so. I'll try and make a habit of writing here most every day, just to see where it goes. I don't know that I have anything really exciting or profound to say, but I hope that anyone who happens to drop by and read my mumblings enjoys them.   So, until next time...   Brannigan

      OK, I promised my next post would be less morose than its predecessors. So here goes.  Way back yonder in the last dying days of 1991, my first working band, the Wheaties, broke up in a boiling meltdown of interpersonal freakouts. We'd already had to fire our drummer, my best friend Clark Baker, who co-founded the group with me; his alcoholism, coupled with his destructive relationship with a near-psychotic Native American girl, had made dealing with him within the band framework very difficult. Clark's replacement was Johnny Jasper, and old friend of our lead guitarist Roy Shanks. It was with Johnny that we recorded our only official cassette release, in May of '91; that project was done live at a legendary local dive called the Hole. (Ironically, Clark's next band, a punk unit designed to give the finger to the Wheaties, opened the shows that weekend.)  Late in the year, Roy and our bass player Sylvia Beck, who had been living together for some time, broke up. Roy had already been messing around with another band (he was really too good for us, and we all knew it), and his messy breakup with Sylvia was really the nail in the coffin for the Wheaties.  As December rolled around, Roy, our friend Bill Altman and I brewed up an idea for a new musical project: The Zig-Zags. It was to be a three-piece group with me on guitar, Bill on bass and Roy pounding on drums. Everything would be improvised. We booked a show at Darby's Tavern, the dank little hole that was our musical home base, and upon setting up our equipment, we each took a hit of LSD. (We were all taking  a lot  of LSD at that time.)  I don't remember much about how the show went. At the time I wasn't really that great a guitar player (not much has changed, actually), Bill hadn't played the bass since his high school punk band, and Roy had never spent any appreciable time behind the drums. But we established a couple of monotonous grooves and freaked out on them for extended periods of time, just like those damned dirty hippies used to do. It went over pretty well, though I must admit the audience was mostly composed of friends.  By the time our next gig rolled around — a  paying  gig officially sanctioned by the local university, no less! — we had doubled up to a six-piece group, with the young Dan Crane on second guitar, Roy's newfound musical cohort Dirk Rondolet on second percussion, and local punk icon Paul Heimlich on second bass. We had also added a dual slideshow (two projectors with images superimposing one another, projected onto the band) and a background tape of psychedelic noises, repeated bits of spoken word and sound effects albums and generally trippy shit.  This gig was held in the basement of the student union building on campus, in a dim little joint called Grand Central Pizza, where 3.2 beer was sold. The six of us set up our equipment and enlisted a friend in the audience to run the slide projectors. Then we started playing.  Our sound was ominous, occasionally beautiful, mostly unsettling. More than anything, perhaps, it was  really fucking loud.  Roy and Dirk bashed away on their bits and pieces of assembled drum gear and machinery (including an industrial washing machine drum), discovering tribal rhythms buried deep in their white DNA. Bill and Paul created dense chunks of low-end noise; Bill played his bass through a wall of heavy fuzztones, and Paul metered out clean, round, thick, staccato bursts in strict time. Dan and I thrashed furiously at our guitars, generating interlocking webs of noise, meandering from consonance to dissonance and back in a heterodyne whistle of six-stringed bliss. With cats fighting, a businessman reciting, "Dear Bill" over and over, and a recording of a man having a bad acid trip playing in the background, the sound of the Zig-Zags was, to say the least, unlike anything else going on in town at the time.  A good crowd turned out, including some I recognized as being the college jazzbeaus. About ten minutes into our first "song", the little Middle Eastern guy who managed the pizza place came over to us and stood patiently waiting for us to finish. We finally did after about 45 minutes, at which time he informed us that we were disturbing people on the third floor of the building.  We pretended to turn down our amps, then blasted out another 45-minute barrage of squawling psychedelia. They took our picture for the college newspaper, and ran it with a review. In the photo you can see that Dirk's hand has been cut wide open on a jagged, broken cymbal, and is bleeding profusely.  I guess the word got out to the freaks, because our next show, held at Darby's, was insane. When we showed up in the afternoon to start setting up our shit, one of the owners of Darby's, Roger DaVinci, saw that we were screening off the stage area with a sheet of thick, clear plastic tarp material. Our idea was to obscure ourselves somewhat from the audience, and shoot the slide projections onto the semi-translucent plastic. Roger upped the ante; he drove over to the nearby K-Mart and returned with numerous cans of fluorescent spray paint and three blacklights. We all went apeshit with the paint, spraying squiggly patterns and words all over the plastic curtain. Roger arranged the blacklights behind the curtain, attaching them to the ceiling above the tiny stage area. The effect was of a glowing, multihued, Day-Glo box, from which the cacophony would later emanate in ghostly fashion.  By the time the show was ready to start, the bar was packed to beyond capacity. (This is not terribly unusual, as the place is only 20 feet square, including the area behind the bar, the stage and the restrooms.) A lot of people from the U's music department showed up, as did a sizable faction of local acid eaters, who obviously were getting their RDA of LSD that evening. The six of us in the group made our way behind the curtain and packed ourselves like sardines on the stage; the sound effects tape was started, and the noise began.  Maybe 20 minutes into the opening number, I found room to lie on my back on the stage among the feet and wires and pedals. I reclined with my knees pulled up, got comfy and grooved on the cyclone of noise around me. Then I saw the glowing red tip of a cigarette, nosing its way through the plastic curtain in front of the stage. Someone was burning holes in our partition.  I glanced up at Bill and gestured with my eyes and a jerk of my head to the site of the infiltration. Bill looked, took note and grinned. And then the whole curtain fell down, exposing us to the throng in the little bar. There were a lot more people there than when we had started, and they were pressed right up to the stage, unable to step back an inch. I stood up. The music took us where it wanted to go, and eventually it was over. It was one of the greatest shows I ever played.  The Zig-Zags played out only sporadically, but our Saturday afternoon rehearsals at Paul's house were not to be missed. We'd smoke ridiculous quantities of ridiculously powerful home-grown pot and blow the roof off Paul's wee bungalow with the six of us crowded into his tight living room, our amps cranked to the heavens. Late in the summer of '92, we decided to take a hiatus to make a Super 8 movie. We planned to edit together about 30 minutes of footage to project behind the band, and maybe actually work up a loose framework for a piece of music to accompany it. Dan Crane and I went out in the country in his Volkswagen Beetle and shot a couple rolls of film, but the whole deal just kind of petered out, and the band never played again.  That fall, Dan, Bill and I would go on to form Sunny Bunny, the band that would easily become the most popular I was ever in. This was also the time period when I started work on opening the city's first modern coffeehouse...but that's a story for another time.  Oh yeah, I promised sex, drugs and rock & roll in this post, and yet somehow I missed including the sex. Suffice it to say that during this era of my life, I was having lots of it, with numerous lovely young ladies whose memories I shall always cherish in my heart. 'Nuff said.  Brannigan

      Suicide. For nearly as long as I can remember, the compulsion to kill myself has stalked me like my own shadow. I've made two attempts over the years — the first half-hearted, the second whole-hearted but mysteriously unsuccessful — and yet I still live.   Among the many mental oddities that plague me is the hyperactivity of my brain; at all times I am subjected to an unending internal barrage of thoughts, images, sounds, songs, memories, noise and moment-to-moment emotional peaks and valleys. I can't shut it down, even when the horrific nature of the imagery and ominous suggestions inside my head make me sick with panic. More and more lately, the image of me putting my pistol into my mouth pops up throughout the day. "Shoot yourself," says the Id.   Now, I don't want to shoot myself. I mean, I'm pretty much back on the bottom of the social pile at this point — flat broke, out of work for nearly a year, separated from Wife #2, two broken cars, one broken motorcycle, health problems, rent coming due, no air conditioning in my third-floor apartment, one pair of pants to my name, balding, riddled with psychic damage, etc. — but still, the natural instinct to survive at all costs remains strong within me. I don't want to give in.   Today I drove over to Dag's tattoo shop and he paid me for minding the store while he was out of town; he even gave me more than we agreed upon, a godsend. I immediately rushed to the bank to make a deposit, hoping to outrun a check I wrote the other day. Fortunately I made it, and nothing bounced.  Whew.    I've been revamping a website for a locally-based corporation, and have spent the past several weeks waiting anxiously for a check from them. Today I found out they didn't have a copy of the invoice I sent, so I had to e-mail a copy to a friend who has a printer (mine is still over at the ex's place, buried in the rubble of our failed marriage), have him print it out, and drive it to the corporate office. If all goes well, they'll issue a check this Friday, which should reach me just in time to pay my rent next Tuesday. Cross your fingers for me, eh?   Curtis, the guy whose house I'm supposed to be helping repaint, still hasn't laid his hands on the power washer needed to blast the old paint off, so once again I'm in limbo. The sooner we get that done, the sooner I'll have some cash in hand. Another day wasted on that front, as was yesterday. Which sucks, because Monday (when we worked) it was 94 degrees outside, and the past two days we haven't worked have been pleasant and overcast. Ah, cést la vie.   All these little frustrations add up on me after a while, as they would most anyone. But I'm afraid I'm just ill-equipped to handle the stress. Driving around in my ex's beat-up little Honda today I could feel the dark, desperate cloud of depression looming over me. It's so familiar to me, it's tangible.   Walking around with a shopping basket in hand at the local grocer's this afternoon I felt the urge to sit down next to the shelves of vegetable oil and shortening and just plant my head in my hands and cry. I caught sight of myself in the mirrors behind the bread display and saw myself hunched as in pain, my face contorted into an ashen mask of grief. I straightened and consciously made an effort to look more pleasant, but the story was still there in my eyes. Even the girl at the checkout counter gave me a look of concern when I entered her aisle.   This happens to me over and over in life, and no course of medical treatment has properly addressed it. Over time I've begun to agree with those who criticize treating depression as a medical issue rather than an emotional/spiritual one; the medical paradigm mandates that the "patient's" brain chemistry be manipulated with chemicals, while the emotional/spiritual approach places more importance on the "talking cure." Rarely has a psychiatrist seemed interested in the events in my life that shaped me; so long as I'm taking the pills, they're happy.   But so long as I'm taking the pills, I'm unhappy.  Unhappier,  in fact, than I am when in my "normal" frame of mind. By the doctor's parameters, I may appear to be "improved", but living as a corpulent, ineffectual zombie is not my definition of improvement. I'd rather be depressed and overwhelmed with the torrent of static in my head. I'd rather keep on counting my steps, compulsively chanting and praying, being obsessed with symmetry. I'd rather be unable to stop meowing, barking and making pirate noises. I'd rather  not  have the incredibly frightening anxiety attacks in the middle of the night, but I'm afraid those are episodes that I never had  until I took the fucking medicine in the first place.    I've had it with modern medicine, at least insofar as it applies to treatment of the mind.   The saddest thing of all is that I used to be a "genius". I just recently found my standardized test scores from elementary school, and noticed that I scored in the 99th percentile in almost every area of study. I heard the word "potential" constantly as a child in reference to my brainpower. I was in the Gifted program in my small-town school system, got high marks on the SAT when I was in seventh grade (and was offered a scholarship to Duke University on that basis), and did so well on the ASVAB (Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery) test in high school that I had every branch of the U.S. military hounding me to enlist as an intelligence officer.   Now I'm a burned-out husk of a man crash-landing on Skid Row, living hand-to-mouth, unable to pay back hundreds of dollars to friends who have kindly bailed me out in the past. I own nothing of value, my credit is decimated, my checking account never has $100 in it. I watch my friends prosper all around me, raising families, buying decent houses, driving functional automobiles. I'm not talking about gated communities and Hummers, just basic getting-along-in-life — I have always been grossed out by materialism, status symbols and conspicuous consumption. But my friends are making it, and all the hard work I've put in over the years has come to naught. The moral of the story is obvious to me: I'm all fucked up.   When I first started the antidepressant treatments three years ago, I had timid hopes that maybe the stuff would clear my head, dispel the eternal cyclone of noise inside me and help me get my life together. How could I have known that the stuff would make everything worse, maybe permanently?   I guess I should have done my homework. Once I started tapering off the drugs, I poked around on the internet and found numerous bulletin boards where users of Paxil and similar drugs posted messages to one another in a sort of ad hoc cyber-support group. Through reading lots of information on the subject of SSRI withdrawal, I discovered that many annoying physical problems I started having around this time may be connected to use of the drugs.   Among the reported aftereffects of Paxil,  et al  that I have personally experienced (and continue to experience) are: intense insomnia; extraordinarily vivid dreams (often dreadful nightmares in my case); intense fear of losing my sanity; steady feeling of existing outside of reality as I know it (referred to as depersonalization at times); memory and concentration problems; panic attacks; severe mood swings, esp. heightened irritability/anger; suicidal thoughts; the feeling of shocks, similar to mild electric one, running the length of my body; an unsteady gait; profuse sweating, esp. at night; breaking out in tears; hypersensitivity to motion, sounds, smells; chills/hot flashes. (Symptom descriptions here taken from  urlLink QuitPaxil.info .)   Anyway, it was hard for me to hold a job and keep a steady relationship going before all that, with just the chronic up &amp; down of manic depression and the annoying manifestations of OCD. Now I've got the whole mess.   On top of it all, I can't express myself any more the way I used to. Writing is a difficult task, whether it's a news story, an e-mail to a friend, this blog or a song. I can't be sure, of course, but I think that's all connected to the drugs, too. Ironically the years I spent taking LSD and smoking tons of pot were among the most freely creative of my life. It's like Bizarro World — the illegal stuff is less harmful than the legal stuff.   Several years ago I started a song called "Suicide", but never finished it. There's one verse:    Suicide, I've loved you from afar  How many times you've caught my eye  Standing across the bar  I feel a pang of envy  Each time you take a friend  So hold me in your loving arms  And let my misery end.    I've tried to add more since then, but it's never worked out.   This blog's getting to be a bummer, eh? Come back next time and I promise I'll tell you a happy story with lots of sex, drugs and rock &amp; roll.   Keep on smilin'!   Brannigan

      Writing a blog reminds me of the  urlLink record album  they sent into space on the Voyager craft back in the '70s; given that the space probe was shot on a vector headed straight out of the solar system, the folks at NASA decided to include a message from our planet, in case alien life forms ever intercepted Voyager. Along with snippets of Earth music (Chuck Berry's "Johnny B. Goode" and the haunting "Dark Was the Night" by seminal bluesman Blind Willie Johnson among them), greetings in 55 languages were included on the gold-plated metal LP. Carl Sagan was in charge of the project, and his son Nick, who's roughly my age, provided the English greeting:  urlLink "Hello from the children of planet Earth."  (I could go on about the thing, but I'll spare you. If you want to know more about the Voyager album, click  urlLink here .  Anyhow, my point is that blogging is akin to sending out a probe into the vast, empty, unknowable vacuum of space. I'm typing across the aether, wondering if my words will ever reach sentient eyeballs. If not, no harm done. But if my missives succeed in transmitting themselves into the brains of other soul-bearing beings, the implications are staggering! Well, to me, anyway.  We're all the centers of our own universes — more like an infinitely overlapping multiverse, actually. Objectivity is a myth given birth by the impossibly coincidental fact that each of our individual intertwined universes bears a remarkable physical likeness to all the others. We think we're all in the same place at the same time, but it's just a fluke. Illusion.  Maya  to the Buddhists;  Tonal  to Castaneda's mysterious  brujo,  Don Juan. Et cetera.  Being the center of my own universe (as we all are), I am naturally curious about what's "out there", meaning outside myself in this case. The antidepressant regimen I endured several years ago has left me in a seemingly-permanent state of detached semi-alienation, a kind of limbo in which I always feel separated from the people and things around me, like a boy in a plastic bubble. This sensation was very marked during the last phase of my course of treatment (Wellbutrin & Depakote cocktail, straight up), and though it's diminished to a degree over the past three years, it lingers persistently, as do numerous other less-than-desirable "aftereffects" of the drugs. This feeling of disconnectedness only enhances my desire to reach out beyond my own personal solar system and say hello.  I just walked across the street to the Kwik-E-Mart to get some cigarettes (my recent attempt at quitting reduced to ash) and a pint of half-and-half for my coffee. The girl at the counter I recognized as a cashier from a different Kwik-E-Mart that I used to frequent on my way to work; she had been transferred a couple of times, and now works at the store in my neighborhood. She said she thought of me recently when they installed the new super coffee bars in the stores; I had long bemoaned the lack of chilled creamer dispensers and other highfalutin coffee accessories, and now the Kwik-E-Mart coffee area is a vast, sleek, caffeine-laden oasis, offering up flavored syrups, gourmet coffee blends and other dark-roasted dreams for 99¢ a cup. God bless America.  Upon leaving the store I passed two men coming from around the side of the building on foot. One wore a button-down chambray work shirt tucked into clean pleated khaki Dockers, his thin black hair neatly gelled into place. His companion, taller and vaguely ethnic-looking, wore a tuxedo sans cummerbund and bow tie. The man in the tux was talking as they walked together.  "I just think things could be a lot more fun around here," he said as I passed them in the opposite direction.  It's hot today. I went over to Curtis Wilkerson's house to start the arduous task of repainting it, and the temperature reached 94 degrees, five degrees hotter than predicted by the National Weather Service. We didn't do any actual painting, but we did work the entire perimeter of the house with hammers and nails, fastening down the wooden siding where time and weather had loosened it. Tomorrow we'll blast the old paint off with a power washer, unless we're stymied by the thunderstorms predicted by the National Weather Service. Curse you, National Weather Service! The local forecasters were wrong about the intermittent showers tonight, but you were right! Even now I hear thunder resonating off in the distance, and the occasional faroff spark of lightning backlights the rose-printed bedsheet I've repurposed as a curtain in my tiny apartment's living room window.  The Daily Show comes on in a few minutes. Think I'll pour another cup o' coffee (my third this evening) and watch it.  Oh, and remind me to tell you about my neighbor, Miriam.  Hello from the children of planet Earth!  Brannigan

      So much of the time I feel like the guy spinning plates on the Ed Sullivan Show; I can almost hear "Sabre Dance" whirling in my head as I flit from one bit of vital tedium to another. Having no job (the tattoo shop thing is more akin to charity than actual employment) means doing all kinds of little things to bring in a few bucks here and there. Tomorrow I'm supposed to start helping a guy I know — a local biker named Curtis Wilkerson — scrape and repaint his house. I'm supposed to go over and give my friend Jamie an estimate on painting her basement as well. (Note: I fucking  hate  painting, but I've got to take the work.) And I'm selling one of my two prized '66 Dodges, the one I love the most, the station wagon. But a guy's gotta do what a guy's gotta do. Got to keep those plates spinning.  At least my love life has been pleasant as of late. Since my breakup with the missus a few months ago, I've had a few scattered flings of various duration; I'm currently seing an unconventionally beautiful 21-year-old named Linda. I first saw her at the Troubador, the neighborhood bar where I get my coffee fix. She and I were both regulars, and after we had exchanged nods of acknowledgement on a couple occasions, we made small talk. She always had a book in hand, and I think I broke the ice by commenting on whatever it was she was reading at the time.  Shortly thereafter she came into the tattoo shop and got a lovely classic Asian design inked in. She and Dag, my friend who runs the shop, went on a date, which I thought might scotch any future possibility I had of asking her out, but Dag assured me he didn't care if I did. Neither of us is really looking for a "girlfriend" at this stage in the game; I'm still in the throes of separation from my second wife, and Dag is happily divorced. So everything's kosher between us on that front.  Which is good, because I started seeing her pretty regularly shortly thereafter. She invited me over to her house to watch  Big Fish  on DVD. Because she works a second-shift job, I went over to her house at about one in the morning. I met her roommates and we all sat around taking bong hits and watching the movie. Linda and I stayed up talking until nearly five a.m.  Soon after, she called me up out of the blue. I was surprised and delighted, I must say, to receive the attention from a girl I found so intriguing; though I don't know why, I felt from the first time I saw her that I somehow already knew her, like maybe we were fellow travelers from other, previous lifetimes. I confessed this to her, and was surprised to hear that she felt the same. We both were attracted to one another on some level other than that of surface physicality. I still have no explanation for this, other than it's just another one of those mysterious things in life that lends our human experience the illusion of intelligent design.  Whatever the nature of our attraction, she came to my house late that night after work. We smoked pot and talked in the dim, cozy living/bedroom of my little apartment, comparing notes about what each thought was compelling about the other.  "There are a lot of things about you that I'm curious about," Linda said.  "Like what?" I asked. My whole life I've balanced precariously on the edge between self-hatred and egomania, so I'm always curious about others' perceptions of me; my own are obviously grossly distorted.  Linda hemmed and hawed for a minute, then answered: "Like...your manhood."   What the fuck?  I didn't know what to think. I mean, we were having a discussion tinged with philosophical elements, so I thought at first she must have been curious about my experience as a man. I am 14 years older than her, you know, and so I guessed that that was her angle.  "Well, I'm a man..." I muttered, not sure where to go from there. "I guess I don't understand what you mean by 'manhood'. Usually when I hear that term, it's being used as a euphemism for 'penis'."  "Yeah, that's what I meant," she said.  We sat facing one another, she in my sole armchair, me on the purple shag carpeted ottoman, both of us smoking cigarettes. We didn't speak. We extinguished our butts at the same time, and I leaned forward toward her. I beckoned her with a crooked forefinger.  "Come here."  She leaned into my face and instantly we were kissing passionately, forcefully. By the time the evening's sweaty, animalistic festivities were through, the sun was up and I was as spent as I've been in years.  Since then we've spent a number of late nights and late mornings together, seeing one another in the odd hours around her work shift. But there's a kind of cloud hanging over our affair, a shadow that keeps us from getting too attached to one another. Linda is leaving town in three weeks, moving out to the West Coast; her job transfer was just approved the other day. The knowledge of her impending departure has prevented either of us from making anything more of our relationship than what it is. We hook up for lunch, or just to hang out and smoke some pot or watch cartoons. Sometimes she comes over and stays the night, as she did the past two nights (it was a weekend). Sometimes we have sex (which is  very  fulfilling), sometimes not. But even when we don't, I'm not disappointed. I just cherish the time we have together, as I know that she'll be gone before long. There's a slight melancholy at the skirts of our affair, surely, but as I told her when she informed me that her transfer was confirmed, at least we're making some good new memories for the future.  This all ties in with my recently-rekindled interest in Buddhism. The first of the Four Noble Truths is that all life is suffering, a concept that makes a lot of Westerners uncomfortable; but hang on, it's not so bad. The second truth is that the root cause of all this suffering in life is  desire  — the wanting of what is not. The third is that one can overcome the suffering by pushing away desire and embracing what  is.  And the fourth is that the road to happiness is called the Eightfold Path, which is an eight-point set of guidelines encouraging "right mind", "right speech", "right action", etc. (That's enough of an ultra-rough intro to Buddhism — for more go to  urlLink BuddhaNet .)  Anyhow, my point is that I'm a lot happier enjoying the time I have together with Linda right now than I would be if I was already pining away for her in advance. I've been that guy before — the guy who can't concentrate on the present due to fretting about the future — and it's no way to live. You end up in a state of constant frustration, unable to truly get into any moment because you're preoccupied with a moment that's not subject to your influence. It's a terrible trap to let your spirit fall into, and now I've come to recognize it, and to a great degree I've been able to nip it in the bud any time I feel it sneaking up on me.  "Be here now," they say. Good advice.  Between reading up on Buddha (and Jack Kerouac, a continuing interest of mine) and doing home-style workouts here in my little apartment (a broom handle through the bail of a five-gallon bucket of paint makes a handy barbell!), I've been feeling a little better as of late. I'm still panicky a lot, especially at night, and I've been kind of isolating myself at home now that I have a place of my own, but on the whole, I think I'm on an upswing. I've cut down on cigarettes, and since my car broke down the other day in front of Curtis' house (long story), I've been riding the vintage two-speed Schwinn bicycle he loaned me. My ex, Frida, has loaned me her old beat-up Honda while she's in possession of her parents' car, but I haven't gone anywhere in a couple days. Anyway, I'm getting more exercise (the third-floor walkup here in the building helps), eating a little less and just generally trying to get myself into some form of shape, be it mental, physical, spiritual, emotional — whatever. As the old hippie novel said, "Been down so long it looks like up to me."  Anyway, I'm about wiped out for tonight. I was up until almost 4:30 last night because the woman below me had her stereo turned up loud, and the bass resonates through the floor. I finally had to walk downstairs in my boxer shorts and bang on her door for five minutes before she answered; she had fallen asleep (drunk I'd guess from the smell of liquor on her) with a rock radio station blaring. The upshot of all this is that now it's one in the morning and I'm beat, and as I wrote above, I'm supposed to start a long, grueling house-painting gig tomorrow (later today, at this point). Well, it's money in my pocket, anyway, and thank heaven for that.  'Til next time...  Brannigan

      This is a  loooooooooong  post. You've been warned.  I've alluded to my troubled childhood in previous posts, and though I've addressed some of the related psychic fallout I live with to this day, I have yet to really expound on the nature of the abuse I suffered. If you're bothering to keep up, I owe you a more complete overview. Here it is.  My mother and father split up when I was about three years old, back circa 1972. My mother, pregnant at the time, and I moved into her parents' house. My little brother Cody was born that summer. Though we lived in the same town with my father, we never saw him; in fact, I wouldn't become acquainted with him until much later, when I was probably twelve.  By 1975, my mother was dating a diesel mechanic named Darrell Macon. The Macons were universally despised in my small hometown; they lived like hillbillies in an A-frame house covered in corrugated tin, outside of town on an oft-flooded piece of riverfront property dotted with several hundred junked cars and trucks. They had no running water in the house, depending on a nearby artesian well for fresh spring water. The indoor bathroom was a small cubicle with a lightbulb hanging from the ceiling with a pullchain for switching it off and on; the toilet was a five-gallon Porter Paints bucket with a toilet seat perched on top. The door was spring-loaded, and had no handle; on the outside of it was written  SHIT!  in black felt-tip.  When I first met Darrell, he lived in a rundown (but historic) old hotel on the main street in my hometown. We'd go visit him with my mother, and while the two adults were talking, drinking beers and smoking cigarettes, my little brother and I would play in the decrepit elevator or the spooky old abandoned pool room (an ancient decal on the door advertised air conditioning and cigarettes all at once: IT'S KOOL IN HERE!); alternately, we'd read through Darrell's collection of comic books. He had stuff like  Scrooge McDuck  and  Richie Rich , which was fine with me. Darrell loved to take us out to the Sonic drive-in restaurant, to the drive-in theater, for drives out in the country. He was a hardcore gearhead, and everything we did involved an automobile.  He and my mother married that year. We moved into a house about four blocks down the street from my beloved grandparents, not to mention my best friend, who lived next door to my grandparents and who had the same birthday as me. I was very sad, but at the same time, I liked the big bedroom with bunk beds that my brother and I shared. Our neighbors were a nice black family, sans a father; the son, Tyrone, would be an on-again, off-again babysitter for years to come.  It was shortly after we moved into that house when I first recall hearing my mother and stepfather having sex. I had no idea what they were doing. The doors to the master bedroom were closed, and from inside came a lot of banging and moaning. My mother's cries were loud and frightening. Cody and I nervously supposed that they were in there killing each other. But lo and behold, they came out eventually, and seemed to be just fine.  Darrell took a job as a truck driver. We moved from house to house several times, always trying to stay one step ahead of landlords and bill collectors. I changed elementary schools four times between first and fifth grades. When I was about eight years old, Darrell figured out I had been fingering through his collection of  Hustler  magazines (hey, they were  right there ), and decided to give me a little lesson.  He sat me down with one of his skin mags and we looked at a photo spread. A young woman was checking herself out in a mirror, nude, striking various poses. In one photo, she was touching her crotch. Darrell asked if I knew what she was doing.  "I dunno," I mumbled, embarrassed at the whole situation. "Getting dressed to go out?" I remember thinking that the model looked like she was dolling up for a night on the town, perhaps at one of those discos all the grown-ups were talking about. It's funny, in a way, that 25 years later, I remember thinking that girl was going to a disco.  "She's  jacking off ," Darrell told me. He then explained further about how people make themselves feel good by touching their privates. I tuned out and continued nodding until the lecture was over.  Shortly thereafter, we moved once again, into the house where stuff started getting really weird. I had already been having strange sexual dreams and waking reveries, but I didn't have any kind of context into which I could put such thoughts. I remember having a recurring daydream about waking up in my bed and finding that I had become an older (teenage) girl. In this fantasy, I'd dash off in my too-small boy clothes, just a shirt and briefs, escaping my house and life and identity.  I'd also play with my penis, rubbing it until it was hard, and then stand in my bedroom window, exposing myself to the world — at least what little part of the world could see into my window across the half-acre between it and the highway. Apparently my mother spied me doing this, and mentioned it to Darrell.  I received another lecture, this one on the benefits of lubrication. I guess my mother had thought my penis looked red when she had come upon me masturbating; at any rate, Darrell was there to show me the light. We stood in the kitchen. He grabbed my right wrist in one hand and started rubbing his other hand over my forearm, mimicking the motion of jerking off. My skin felt hot as his rough, calloused hands stroked my arm.  "Feel how that's getting hot?" he asked. I nodded. "That's because of  friction . It's what happens when things rub together." He then squirted a palmful of dishwashing liquid into his hand, added a little tap water and lathered it a bit. "Now, see how much better it is with some lubrication?" He returned to stroking my forearm with his soapy hand; it did feel a lot better, I nodded in the affirmative.  "So when you're playing with yourself, always use some lubricant so your pecker doesn't get irritated."  "Like soap?" I asked.  "No, like lotion."  I guess I should explain that both my brother and I were terrified of Darrell. He beat my mother and spanked us brutally without much provocation. He was a fierce drunk, and delighted in belittling all of us in any way he could. Any time he reached in my direction, I flinched involuntarily. Things had changed since the early days with Darrell, and not for the better.  A lot of the time, Cody and I were left alone while Darrell was off hauling hogs in his semi, and my mother was working a third-shift waitress gig at the local Sambo's. Though it was a little scary at the time to be alone in the house with my kid brother, I must admit that in retrospect, this neglect was far more precious to me than any attention I received from Mom and Darrell. If they were gone, at least no one was getting beaten, yelled at or humiliated. (And staying home alone all night beat sleeping in the car in the parking lot of the industrial park where Darrell worked briefly as a welder.)  In the summer between third and fourth grade, I found a brand-new  Close Encounters of the Third Kind  t-shirt on the playground of my elementary school. Though school was out for the season, my classmates and I still hung out there and played on the equipment. On this particular day, I was walking alone on the school grounds when I noticed the blue t-shirt wadded up and forgotten in the dirt.  Now,  Close Encounters  was a big cultural phenomenon at the time, and I was delighted to find something so cool; unlike my classmates, I didn't have any cool clothes or accessories. No  Mork and Mindy  lunchbox, no Fonzie t-shirt,  nothin' . So I was hyped at my find. I ran the six or so blocks all the way back to my house, anxious to proudly display my prized booty to the family.  When I got home, the door was unlocked. (I always wore a key on a shoestring around my neck — the original latchkey kid.) I walked in and found the place quiet. Poking my head into the master bedroom, I got a full view of my mother and Darrell  in flagrante delicto . I froze for a second, and before I could pull my head back out of the room and sneak away, I heard Darrell's voice.  "Hey, come here."  I took about two paces into the bedroom and stopped. Darrell was on top of my mother, pumping his hips while he looked me over. His thick sideburns contrasted with the shiny bald pate of his head, glistening with sweat in the still, humid afternoon.  "Well, don't just stand there...come on over and join in," he said. Mom laid prostrate, moaning quietly as Darrell thrust in and out of her. I shook my head. Darrell looked disgusted. "Suit yourself."  I backed out of the room and fled to the back yard, where I hid behind the trashcan. I sat cross-legged in the grass and looked down at the t-shirt in my hands. It suddenly made me sick. I stood up, threw it in the garbage and wandered around the neighborhood for a few hours.  While living in that same house, I found several discarded porno magazines in other people's garbage cans. I had already developed a habit of dumpster-diving (though most of my best finds were taken from me by Darrell once I brought them home), and coming across a cache of strokebooks was like striking gold. Keep in mind I was not yet ten years old. I brought a stack of freshly-unearthed dirty books to my house one afternoon while the parents were out; on top of the pile was a black-and-white magazine featuring all sorts of photos of men sucking each other's penises. This was curious to me — did men really do that sort of thing?  I went to the bathroom, and was sitting on the john when I heard my mother come in the front door. I had temporarily forgotten about the pile of smut on the kitchen table.   "Patrick Stuart Brannigan!"  my mother screamed. Uh-oh. I finished my business in the bathroom and went out to face the music. I didn't get in real trouble, though; my mom threw the magazines out and told me not to bring any more of that stuff home. (When I found subsequent materials, I hid them outside the house, or sold them to the college student who lived in a garage apartment across the street.)  We moved yet again, this time to a little bungalow in a sparse, brick-streeted neighborhood across town. I had a great bedroom, actually an enclosed breezeway connecting the utility room to the detached garage. It had its own door to the front yard, and was just wide enough to put my twin bed in sideways. I loved that room at first.  But then my mother started coming in the middle of the night. Sometimes Darrell would be with her, sometimes not. Invariably, the routine would be the same. Mom would take the pillow from under my head and place it over my face. I would then feel the blankets being pulled down to my feet, then the bottoms of my pajamas, then my briefs. My mother would lower her mouth onto my underdeveloped penis and perform fellatio. Though I didn't understand at the time, I assume now that she was also manually stimulating herself, as I remember the bed wiggling in conjunction with the illicit activity.  I always hated this, but felt powerless to stop it. These night visitations made me feel kind of sick, like something was wrong with me; I was afraid other people could tell, and that they would pass judgement on me. I started breaking down and crying in school often enough that teachers and counselors bceame concerned, but I never told anyone about what was happening.  Once, when I made a remark to my mother and Darrell casually hinting that I didn't want to do it any more, she told me she'd been doing it to me since I was in diapers. "I used to suck you hard in your crib," she said. Darrell explained that I didn't remember because I had "a mental block", which I pictured literally as a large limestone block being put in place inside my mind. He added that it was my duty to "satisfy" my mother when he was out of town, as I was "the man of the house".  These nocturnal episodes continued. Eventually, my mother and Darrell had a huge physical fight, resulting in our house being violently trashed. We moved, sans Darrell, into a tiny little mother-in-law house (actually a converted garage) on an alley behind a much nicer two-story affair, in an established part of town filled with nice houses. We lived like paupers in the midst of comfortable middle class families whose kids I attended school with; in fact, a classmate lived in the house on the front of the property.  In no time, Darrell was coming around again. He and my mother broke the sofa in the living room one night while fucking on it; that's when I first knew he was back in our scene. I remember being awakened by the splintering crack of the couch as it snapped, then hearing Darrell's voice and feeling my heart sink in my little chest.  They continued to involve me in their sexplay, though the routine had changed. Around the time of my tenth birthday (when my grandparents gave me a cool little drum kit, which my mom later pawned), I was pulled out of a deep sleep and marched into the freezing cold master bedroom, which was actually a screened-in porch with no glass windows, only plastic sheeting stretched across the wire mesh. There was a portable electric heater in the room, but I could still see my breath hanging in the air against the hazy plastic in the windows, illuminated by streetlights outside.  Darrell took me by the arm and guided my hand up inside my mother's vagina. Using my arm like a dildo, he forced it in and out of her until she had several orgasms in close succession. I was very tired and groggy, and wanted badly to go back to bed. Having my arm buried in my mother's womb up to my elbow was repulsive to me; I couldn't imagine anything grosser at the time, yet I was helpless to stop it.  Darrell decided it was time for me to take the plunge, and had me arrange myself on top of my mother in the missionary position. He grabbed my waist and pushed my hips up and down, but it was no use. I wasn't into it, couldn't possibly get an erection, and anyway my penis was still a prepubescent nub — what did they expect of me? (At around this time I remember my mother boasting to a hippie couple she was friends with: "This week I've had a ten-inch dick in me, a five-inch dick in me, and a two-inch dick in me." The mustachioed half of the couple responded: "Sex by year eight, or else it's too late." Who  were  these fucking people?) Eventually Darrell got tired of trying to get me excited, finished fucking Mom himself, and left for the bathroom. I told my mother straight up that I didn't want to do it any more. She promised me I wouldn't have to.  It wasn't long afterward that she came back into my room in the middle of the night, once again trying to get me to come to her bedroom to "play" with her and Darrell. I invoked her promise; she sighed and left me be. I was never involved in their fucked-up games again, thankfully.  But the sexual weirdness wasn't over yet. We were left one afternoon in the care of a friendly teenager with the unlikely name Vinnie Sacstroker. At first my brother and I had fun with Vinnie, drawing pictures and doing word puzzles. But at some point in the festivities, he unzipped his fly and let his erect, hairy cock stick out of it. He suggested that we follow suit, framing the idea as a fun game. Though I had been in the presence of my stepfather having sex with my mother on many occasions, this was the first time I saw an erect, relatively adult penis close-up in broad daylight.  I took my brother's hand and led him quickly into the bathroom, shut the door and locked it. Vinnie banged on the door, yelled, begged, connived, taunted and bribed us from the other side. He went outside and tried to get in through the window, but it was painted shut and he didn't dare break it. Eventually the sun went down and Cody and I fell asleep. When I woke up, I heard my mother on the other side of the bathroom door, pounding and calling my name.  I told Mom what happened; I don't know whatever became of Vinnie, but I never saw him again.  Though I was no longer involved in sexual activity, the years of improper sexualization left me with a host of sexually-related mental and emotional problems. Today I fit the definition of a sex addict by most any set of guidelines; part of me wants to sleep with every woman I see. I have met women online for sex. I masturbate compulsively and cannot seem to break my psychological dependency on pornography and written erotica.  The advent of the internet has only served to make it harder to avoid indulging in graphic sexual imagery, and in my constant quest for fresh porn, I have stumbled across all manner of horrors. Some of these images I cannot erase from my mind; in fact, I feel my general slide into massive depression began around the time I first encountered the festering, exploitative underbelly of the net. Even still, I feel compelled to jerk off to porn, though I know the possibility of coming across another triggering image is real and dangerous.  Many of the long-term effects of childhood sexual abuse find manifestation in me. Among the widely-recognized effects that I note within myself: Anger, Fear, Helplessness, Isolation and Alienation, [Lack of] Legitimacy, Loss, Negative Childhood Peer Relations, Negative Schemas about the Self, Problems with Sexuality, Self Blame/Guilt, Shame/Humiliation, Anxiety, Depression, Dissociation, Hostility, Impaired relationships, Low self-esteem, Sleep disturbance, Suicidal ideas and behavior (these symptom descriptions taken from a Ph.D dissertation on the subject).  No one in the family knows about this stuff — not my real father, not my grandmother, no one outside. In fact, my mother and I have never, ever spoken about it, though recently we had an e-mail exchange in which she offhandedly acknowledged it. She was guilt-tripping me about not calling my grandmother often enough, and I wrote back indicating that she was the last person in the family to be dishing out guilt. The following paragraph is excerpted whole from the last message between us; she sent it almost four months ago and I never responded.   I have No Guilt! I Forgave myself a few years back for what I did to you two boys and I have went on with My Life as is and Iam VERY,VERY Happy with my life. Of course there are things that happen along the way but you have to let it pass and go on!! I suppose you think it is MY fault thgat you are depressed and being kicked out of your own home and cant keep a job! Well let me tell you one thing. You are SOOOOOOOOOOO WRONG!!!!!!!   You may have noticed the reference to "you two boys" — I certainly did, as I had no idea Cody was involved, as well.  I may or may not have mentioned in this or a previous post that my mother and my brother are both natural-born psychopaths. I don't mean that they're violent, necessarily, just that they have no concept of guilt, responsibility or repercussion. Both have done jail and prison time (Cody is rarely out of jail, and when he is, he's stealing from family members). Both are completely unable to resist drugs of any kind. Both have childlike, immature minds and attitudes. They see something they want, and they do whatever it takes to get it, even if it means ripping someone off (which it so often seems to). Cody recently stole our grandmother's purse (not just the money, the whole purse), then after she forgave him and hired him to mow her lawn, she discovered he'd stolen her lawnmower, too. He'll be 32 years old this month. Mom's long prison stint came after she forged checks on my grandparents' account, then cleaned out the toolshed, stole my dead grandfather's car and split town.  In the end, it's very hard for me to forgive my mother for all of this. Regardless of her washing-her-hands take on the situation, I know she legitimately means it. She can't conceptualize cause and effect at the most basic level, so how can she begin to understand how her actions twenty years ago are wrecking my life today?  And why can't I stop it from doing so?

      Linda's gone. Well, she's still in town tonight, but I won't see her again before she leaves tomorrow at the crack of dawn on her way to the Pacific Northwest. I'm trying not to be sad about it, but in the short time we've been keeping company, I've really grown to love the girl.  Last night I baked chocolate chip cookies to take to her parents' lovely semi-rural spread out west of town for a going-away dinner with grilled prime rib and salmon (I went for the beef, natch), then headed back to her house to take bong hits and watch  Pulp Fiction  with Linda and her roommates. Afterward, we retired to my place to spend our last night together. We hit the sack fairly early (right at about 1:00 a.m.); I woke up before my alarm was set to go off at eight, and first thing, we indulged in our final roll in the hay. She always likes it best in the morning, which is just fine by me. It's a good way to start the day.  I made fried "Ham & Bacon"-flavored Spam substitute, eggs over easy and jumbo flaky biscuits with coffee and orange juice for our last breakfast together. We sat at the table in my little kitchen looking at each other, talking and laughing as we listened to the Shaggs'  Philosophy of the World,  which I just burned onto CD for her. (I sent her an eight-disc care package for the road.) She left to meet a hair appointment, and I sat around in my underwear, picking through some piled-up e-mail and listening to John Coltrane.  I was supposed to be finishing up the paint job on Curtis Wilkerson's house, but the past two days have been rainy, which pretty much blows the workday on that particular project. I'm not terribly sorry, though, as I needed a break from all that ladder-climbing and sun exposure. The sunburn I got a week ago is peeling like hell now; my upper arms look like they belong in a burn unit.  My ex, Frida, came over on her lunch break; she needed her Honda back, and my car is all right now that I know what's wrong with it, so we did a two-car convoy over to the house of broken dreams and she returned me to the Troubador so that I could float a check and get some coffee and cigarettes. While I was sitting at the bar there nursing a big fat breve, Linda called and asked if I'd help her finish packing up her things. How could I say no on her last day in town?  We ran some errands, packed her things into her dad's Suburban and the small U-Haul trailer hitched to it, and inched our way out to her folks' place in the country with me at the wheel of the giganto 454-cubic-inch-V8-powered SUV. After dropping off the truck, Linda and I made one last return to her place to cram a remaining few items into her mid-sized sedan, then she took me back to my apartment.  On the way, as we held hands in her overstuffed car, I said, "You know, this may be the last time we ever see each other."  "Don't say that!" she snapped, incredulous.  "Of course  we'll see each other again. I'll be back in a few months for the holidays, you know."  "Let me finish. I'm trying to say that even if we never see one another again, I want you to know that I'm so very thankful for the time we've spent together, and that I've cherished every moment of it, OK?"  Linda wheeled the car into the parking lot behind my building, and came up with the idea of snapping a picture of us together. I held her little SLR camera at arm's length and took a couple shots. We embraced and kissed and moon-eyed one another for a while, neither of us wanting to really say goodbye. I took the can of coffee, the big serving bowl and the plant she gave me and headed up the forlorn stairs to my apartment as she literally drove off into the sunset.  I don't know why I felt so close to Linda right off the bat when we first met; I guess there's no explaining that feeling of casual, easy familiarity people sometimes find between themselves and strangers. Buddhists believe that people are reborn after death, and that sometimes we run into the same people in different lives, though the relationships between two such familiar souls are often vastly dissimilar from one life to the next. I don't know if that's true or not, but if so, perhaps it sheds a little light on the subject.  In the end, it doesn't matter why Linda and I both immediately gravitated toward one another. We shared our inner selves in numerous intimate conversations, laughed a lot, had transcendent sex and just generally enjoyed each the other's company. And no matter how much I try to put on my good Buddhist face and let her go without attachment, I know I'm going to miss her very much. She's been the one bright spot in the rocky-bottom tumult that has been my life as of late. And for that, I could never thank her enough.  Godspeed, baby.  Brannigan

      Wow, I just noticed that almost two weeks have passed since I last posted to this blog. I guess time flies when you're paralyzed with...I don't even know what it is.  But I really do feel paralyzed — pinned down like a butterfly in a fifth-grade science fair project. I get out of bed each morning, brew the coffee, take a bath, read my e-mail and skim through the news sites, listen to some music, check the Help Wanteds for job openings, send off résumés when applicable, maybe make a little breakfast, maybe not. Eventually I put on some clothes and go downstairs to check my mailbox. Maybe I'll go down the street to the Troubador for some more coffee and hopefully some decent conversation, but just as often I sit around the apartment instead.  I want to write more, to get a book out of me before I die. At this rate, though, it looks like I'll most likely leave behind a mountain of false starts, a couple of middle sections and infinite loose ends. My brain is, as always, a non-stop churn of imagery and ideas and stories and words and noise, but getting it out through my fingers seems impossible. I cannot focus, in writing or in life.  I miss Linda. I need a job. My rent's coming due and I'm still coasting on next to nothing. I have an appointment to see a social worker about getting on fucking welfare. Why the fuck won't anybody give me a job?  Last week I found out that the Troubador was hiring; by the time I heard this, they had already hired two people. I was very upset that none of the people who work there, all of whom I'm friendly with, and all of whom are aware that I'm out of work, bothered to mention it to me. A bartending gig would be a godsend at this point.  Every day I lie staring at the ceiling with the horrific recurring vision of me blowing my brains out dancing before my eyes. And then I think of all the loving friends I have, those who have given me such moral (not to mention financial) support over the years. I think of Frida, to whom I'm still technically married; I think of Linda, out there all alone, missing me in the Pacific Northwest; I think of my dear grandmother, the only family member who has unconditionally stood behind me through my whole fucked-up life. I think of Dan Crane, my longtime confidante and musical partner, and his sister Betty, whose estranged husband recently hanged himself. Betty, now living with her small daughter up in the Great Lakes region, and I have spoken several times on the phone lately; I've shared with her my struggle against suicide, and I know it would tear her heart out if I did it.  I think of Clark Baker, perhaps my closest friend due to the trials we faced together back in the day, when our mutual friend Paul Partridge was murdered, our youthful innocence disintegrated in a cloud of gunpowder and intoxicants. He's isolated now, with a wife and baby in a town too far away, and our communications often take on the tone of fraternal dispatches between too-long-separated brothers. He and I both lost a friend to the gun; it would be a tragedy to put Clark through that again.  As long as I think of others, and not myself, it's easier to avoid the sucking mental vortex that draws me inexorably to suicide. So I'm trying to keep that up. In the meantime, however, I have to think of myself at least enough to persist in looking for a job. I know nobody's reading this thing, but in case I'm wrong, take a minute and send a nice thought this way, would you? I need all the help I can get.  Brannigan
