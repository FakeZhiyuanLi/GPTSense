      Dear Journal,        Right now my cousins, Bella and Julian are over, Bella is 5 and Julian is 2. We've played buried treasure about 5 times in a row. And I'm really tierd of it. Oh yeah, and when we were playing hide-and-go-seek, I was hiding in the shower, and someone walked in to go to the bathroom while I was still in the shower. I almost decided to go out, but then I would be a perv because their pants were probably already down. So I stayed in the shower, almost laughing at all of the farting noises, and almost barfing because it smelled like serious shit. My god, I'm never hiding in a shower ever again. NEVER. Right now I'm listening to Greenday, and the guy whos singing sounds hot. If  sounds  hot, think about how he looks... wow. One thing I hate about AIM, is when people put up an away message that says "I am away from my computer right now". Can you TRY to make a creative one? It's not too hard, heres one of mine  The average person goes to the bathroom about 6 times per day.... this is one of those times.  Creative enough. I gotta go now, do something more important, actually thats just an excuse to go away, since I'm to lazy to write more. See yous lata.  -Sierra

       Dear Journal,          I was putting up my interests on this journal, and I think I wrote a lot for music, but then when I was finished, I viewed my blog, and only half of it is there. It really pisses me off, damit! I look really close minded, when I actually have like 10 other bands that I like, and are different types of music. HUZZUH! My day will probably be incredibly boring again, because everyone is gone including TV Hannah, my parents, and James, my older brother. They are all at a garage sale, selling shit. I am listening to the old Madonna right now, the song is Material Girl. I have to go and waste my pathetic life.  -Sierra

       Dear Journal,          All you have to do is click on the title "Hendrix" and it'll lead you to the picture of Hot Hendrix. Lately I've been listening to him, ans he is really good! I was reading someones profile, and it said "so and so's magazine top 100 guitarists" and Jimi wasn't one of them! Comon, so what if he's a druggie, half of them already are! I gotsta go now, but I hope you like my new template thing, the bamboo is good.  -Sierra

        Dear "Journal",   Right now I'm listening to the B-52's and their song "Love Shack". It's a pretty good song. I should be getting school supplies today, or tomorrow, which isn't a good thing. Because that means school is coming soon, and what kind of freak wants that? OK, I must be a freak, because it isn't that bad, until they sign a "major" assignment. What happens if we don't do it? It's just middle school, do we  need  to get good grades, will it matter to our college people. I don't really think so, isn't it just high school that matters? I guess I'm pretty stupid if I got those wrong. Right now I'm eating lucky charms, a resonably good cereal. Oh yeah, Hannah is watching TV too! I knew she would be. I think Hannah could be named the first or second most annoying sister in the world, and no one would complain, but her. She is a complainer, zats for sure. I gotta go now, do some illagal things.  -Sierra

       Dear Journal,  Today Olivia and I went swimming again, and DID get tans, except hers is more than mine, because I kept going in to go on the swingy rope. I know, excuses, excuses. But it is goldenish, just like this color,  right here . Sexy, I know. After we went shwimmin', we went back to her house, zen went to Impulse, and got two movies. We only ended up watching one, "Bill and Teds Excellent Adventure", which is incredibly stupid, but good. I don't feel like writing much anymore, so I will be going now. Shee ya.  -Sierra

       Dear Journal,  Today around 2:30, Olivia went home from our little sleepover. We went to Hollywood and got the movie "The Perfect Score", which ended up being comptely stupid with a horrible ending. When we finished watching that, we watched "Free Willy 2", which was incredibly good. I love that movie, I don't know why. While watching the movies we ate popcorn and Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream. Olivia ate  New York Chocolate Chunk  while I ate  Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough.  It was goot. I think tomorrow we are going swimmin' at SWCC again so we can get tans. How do they do that, you ask? We swim for a bit, then we go outside and lie in the bendy chairs they have there, and well.... tan. Incredibly, eh? HEY! I sound like a canadian. Now for other words, I've been watching the Olympics lately, and the one I really like to watch are the gymnastics, like the one with the two seperate bars, and they do twisty-flippy-double-backhand-springy-maddings. It's A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. Yada yada yada, I keep goin' on! I gotsta go...  -Sierra

        Dear Journal,   I just got back from swimming at SWCC, and it was pretty fun, I went with Olivia, who else? When we got teird of swimming, we went outside in the back and went tanning, so we can both get those nice golden brown summer tans. And I got half of a tan. Olivia is coming over soon, so we can have a sleepover, but in the meantime we are going to go outside again and get MORE of a tan. Summer is almost over, and it is a requirment to have a tan. Damn RIGHT. I need to go now, I think Olivia is here.  -Sierra

IT IS SOOO AWESOME! I love it to death, and it's the coolest shirt I own. I put it on an orange tank top, and it looks a-m-a-z-i-n-g! Yeah, I'm going away now. Bye.  -Sierra

       Dear Journal,  I was just thinking about those mean, nasty kids on the trix cereal commercial. They steal  his  trix right out of his hand, and they say "silly rabbit, trix are for kids", but after you rewrite this "code" it says "fucking rabbit, trix are for us so we can take over the world." Is this true? Yes, I would like to think so, and I think you should too. I think today, for me is going to be another one of those "waste my life" kind of days. I'll probably watch TV for half the day, then lie down on my bed and stare at the wall, and I'll eat all junk food. Ha. My kind of depressing, boring day. Well, I guess I could do something conventional and write a letter to Orlando Bloom, but that's the only good thing I'll be doing today other than writing in you, my precious journal. If I had a real journal, like the kind that you write in with a pencil, I'm sure I wouldn't write this much, because after a while your hand starts to hurt like hell. But typing usually doesn't do that to you, the only reason I said it hurt my hand in my first entry was so I would have an actual excuse to leave, without randomly signing off. I think that 8th grade is going to be sorta hard, because I remember my older brother, James, had to do like a million speeches. I HATE SPEECHES, they are boring and hard to do and nerve racking. Ugh. I've learned to hate school very much in the past few years. Do you know that I have wasted almost half my LIFE going to school? IT IS HORRIBLE.  HORRIBLE!    When school starts, that's when I will have been going to school for  9  whole years of my  13  year old life! That's including kindergarten. Speaking of school, my cousin Bella is going into kinderarten this school year. I think she'll do good. All they teach you in kindergarten is your ABC'S and 123's. And how to share and get along. It's pretty much preschool all over again. Right now Hannah isn't watching TV, because she isn't here right now, she is at Bella's house because she invited her over for a sleepover. Hannah is going into 6th grade this year, and the girl looks NOTHING like me, I have brown hair, and she has blond hair. I have hazel eyes, she has blue eyes. I have tanish skin, she has pale skin. Aren't siblings sopposed to look alike? What happened there? Hannah is the complete opposite of me. I think my mom must have cheated on my dad or something because no one in my family has blond hair. Plus we are a quarter guamanian, and they are really dark people, with tan skin and blackish hair, but yet again, Hannah is blond guamanian. I gotta go now because "my hands are starting to hurt". Gotta go now... shee yous.  -Sierra

       Dear Journal,  I think that I am addicted to my journal, it's good I guess. Today Olivia and I went to McDonalds, then afterwards we went to Western Pet Supply, and there I got 8 golfish for a dollar. And also an underwater snail, which was free with the fish. I just got back from Dairy Queen. YAY! Two fast food places in one day, I'm healthy! :) I have to go and do stuff now, shee ya.  -Sierra

       Dear Journal, I am going to McDonalds with Olivia later, but she is here right now, watching me write in my sacred journal. How fun for her. Hannah, my "little" sister is watching TV as usual. In all of my other entrys from now on I will say if Hannah is watching TV or not, just to let you know how much she does. I am glancing back and forth from the computer to the show  Seventh Heaven , after I gave it a chance, it wasn't that bad suprisingly enough. I sort of like Seventh Heaven. I like Ruthie the best, the little girl. I have to go now, and go to McDonalds on the bus, because I love the bus. Buy.  -Sierra

         Dear Journal, Right now I was just reaally bored, so I decided to do something conventional and write in my beloved journal. I just took a shower, because I was an ugly, sweaty mess. I wonder if anyone reads this other than me, and Olivia. I want them to leave comments, I don't care what it's about, I really don't care, I just want freakin' comments. Right now I'm watching the movie "Hook," basically the 100th version of Peter Pan. You know that they are all the same. Always. That is one of the movies that I don't want them to ever make again. That and "The Land Before Time". My god! There is like 20 of the Land Before Time movies, and they are all the same story! I used to love those dinosaurs, until about the 4th movie. Then it just got pathetic. The worst CD remake is the "NOW thats what i call music" CD's. OH MY GOD! They are up to 16!!!! I remember when I got NOW 4, that was in 2nd grade. They've been around that long! Anyway, I have to go, because I want to go to bed now. Shee Yah.  -Sierra

        Dear Journal,  I haven't written for a day because my stupid, retarded computer stopped working for a day, until my dad finally figured out how to make it start up again. Thank goodness. I just made $30.oo by babysitting my cousins, they are so fun! One of them is 5 and the other 2. I can't tell you their names, because it's top secret, confidential, private. I am happy my nice computer, which I named "Vern" is working again. He usually doesn't act up like that, but I guess he was just overused or something, right Vern? Vern says yes, and that he is horribly sorry, and he just asked me to go drink some tea tomorrow at noon. Of course I said yes. Oh Vern, he is such a sweetie pie. Anyway, on the 12th I went to the movies with Olivia and saw "The Village" at the movie theater at a 7:00 show. It was a really good movie, but the only thing bad about it was it was scary at first, but most of the movie wasn't scary at all, you would have to see it to know what I mean. SO GO SEE IT! I was so scared I was holding my jacket over half of my face, so if anything scary happened, I wouldn't have to go and look away, all I had to do was cover up my face. I was too scared to eat my popcorn the whole time because I thought something scary might happen soon, so I had to keep my hands on my jacket. Plus my neck was sweating like mad. I am going to bed early tonight so I can finally wake up early for once, so I can get used to it for... for.... SCHOOL. Curse that  word.  I am excited for school, but only for the first day, after that, all hell brakes loose. I have to go, because my hands are starting to hurt from typing too much too fast. See ya, I'll prolly write more tomorrow. Bye.  -Sierra

        Dear Journal,             I just woke up, about an hour ago, because I was stupid again going to sleep at 3:00! I am sitting here eating coacoa pebbles on this hot summer day, 88 degrees (thank you weatherbug) and writing in this because I am extremely bored. Today I am an only child, because my sister AND brother are both at my cousins house, it feels good to be an only child. The only other person at the house today is my mom, and Ozzy. Ozzy is my little brother, he is a 2-year-old Jack Russell mix, and he loves toys, like his thing head, taxi, reno dolls, and duck. He is short, has brown, white, and black hair, a docked tail, sticky-uppy ears, and a yellow collar and DAMN is he cute. Other words, I am waiting for a call from my best friend, Olivia, about going to see a movie, but she hasn't called. I am really lazy, so I won't call either. I bet she is just like me, and is being a lazy bum. Oh well. The music I'm listening to right now is  Boogie Nights  ,  by Earth, Wind, and Fire. It's an old song from the 70's, but it's really good.  Dance with the boogie get down, cause boogie nights are allllwaaays the best in town!    It has nothing to do with my mood right now, but it still makes me wanna get up and boogie. I'm reading this book, called "Lucy's Launderette". It sucks horribly, but I'm still going to read it, because I've given up on about 6 books this summer, so I feel stupid. Anyway, I think I'm going to go now and call Olivia. Someone has to call! Shee Yah Lata.      -Sierra

        Dear Journal,            Today was a pretty regular day for me, I woke up around 12:00, because I've been been staying up too late lately, like I am now... hehe. Anyway, I ate breakfast, what consisted of  milk , and  lucky charms . Delicious. Then I just wasted my poor 13-year-old life, watching TV. Later I hung out with my cousin who was over, which was fun until my "little" sister, Hannah Banana came and stole my cousin away from me. I was sad, so I took a shower, because it was a 95 degree day. The shower was amazingly refreshing. I came out, and tied my hair in a bun so it would hopefully be curly in the morning, which always looks good. Then I wasted my day some more, and went on the computer for a few hours. When I got bored, I decided to take advantage of the weather and go tanning. It didn't work because I was lieing down on my front side, and when I thought that side was fully baked, I turned around and the sun was beating death rays into my eyes, so now I have one nice tan side, and one "pale" side. But don't worry, I won't get skin cancer, because I put on sunscreen! Bleck, it smells bad. Anyway, I have to go now, I think it might just be my bed time! Goodnight.       -Sierra
