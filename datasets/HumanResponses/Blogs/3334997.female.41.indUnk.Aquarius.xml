      Ok, maybe this will be my theme for a while ... firsts.  Or maybe not, but this is what I have to share this Friday.  When taking the S Train (aka  The Shuttle ), watch out for Track #4.  You'll want to be sure to run toward the lead car (that is, the one at the every front).  Not only will you beat the rush out at Times Square, you'll avoid the narrow exit-way the folks in the rear cars have to deal with!  As well, whether it's raining or not - there seems to be a big puddle on that end!  So there you have it.  I've gone from Outlook TIPS to Commuter TIPS!  Have a great weekend ...

        Jordan Mae Higgins   - what a nice name.&nbsp; I wonder if I'm the FIRST to post it on the INTERNET!&nbsp; My friend and former co-worker just made the announcement ... congratulation to Steve and his wife, Mrs. Steve!&nbsp; Born July 19th - that makes little Jordan a Leo I think ... also interesting, JMH shares this day with some famous (and infamous) folks ... Lizzie Borden (alleged murderess) and&nbsp;Edgar Degas (artist).&nbsp; Very cool ... :)    Over and out for now!
