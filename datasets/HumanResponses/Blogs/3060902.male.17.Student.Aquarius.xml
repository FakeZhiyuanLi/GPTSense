      monday today... damn xian... especially pe... physical conditioning again... anyway... just now i was sitting in the bus all alone, staring out of the window... maybe it was some latic acid induced meditative state or something but i began stoning and was in a rather contemplative mood... I was looking at ppl around... all going abt own their mundane lives... then i was thinking abt school and the past 3 months... hai... I came to the realisation that i have changed a lot since the beginning of the year... I used to think of myself as a person standing in the eye of the raging storm of life... each person was like a drop of water... swirling around and mixing together, following where the winds blows... I always saw myself as being in the centre of all this chaos, residing in the calmness of the eye... observing and being transfixed by all that was happening around me... the world revolved around me...following me where ever i go... I was neutral... the observer... Following each intriguing movement with the upmost curiosity... I was a like separate entity... But now I came to a realisation... I'm as much a part of this storm as anyone else... I'm a drop of water... swirling and flying on the winds of fate... Interacting together with the other drops of water... I'm part of this crazy world... Not some high and mighty being at it's centre... I must step out join the rest of the world in all its madness... I must step through the threshold and enter the tempest... The world beckons to me... how can one not go on through... I once told my class that i was like frosted glass, forever blur... But now I believe that this piece of frosted glass is beginning to become clearer, as it slowly warms up to the world around it...  1A01E rox my world... U guys change lives without even noeing it...  ps: it's amazing what latic acid can do to your mind... ha ha...

      Raffles kicks ass!!!  Yesterday was the first time i went down for a rugby finals and boy, was it an experience to remember... The game was practically neck to neck... Neither side conceited any tries... 6-3... I have never seen a closer game in my life, not even in the world cup... We were there, cheering our lungs out... Rooting for all of the Rafflesians on the field...  Never have i seen such passion and drive... The rafflesian spirit was truly present on the field... I have always known the passion and drive ruggers have for Raffles, and i am truly honoured to have witnessed it first hand... This is truly the embodiment of the rafflesian spirit...  This is the true soul of Raffles... This is what sets Raffles out from the rest... No one else can boast such passion and comaradarie... Hear the Raffles Roar, and let the world tremble before us...   To all ruggers:  You guys are the champions... It was truly an honour seeing you guys playing in the field... As ben said... This is the stuff dreams are made off... And all of you have truly immortalised yourselves in the annals of the histroy of RJ... And i personally will never forget may 26, the day i saw Raffles triumph against all odds... We are truly the premier institute in Singapore...  Auspicium Melioris Avi A Hope For A Better Age Never before had these words held more meaning...

        Holding Out For A Hero   Where have all the good men gone And where are all the gods? Where's the street-wise hercules To fight the rising odds? Isn't there a white knight upon a fiery steed? Late at night toss and turn and dream of what i need  (chorus) I need a hero I'm holding out for a hero 'til the end of the night He's gotta be strong And he's gotta be fast And he's gotta be fresh from the fight I need a hero I'm holding out for a hero 'til the morning light He's gotta be sure And it's gotta be soon And he's gotta be larger than life   Somewhere after midnight In my wildest fantasy Somewhere just beyond my reach There's someone reaching back for me Racing on the thunder and rising with the heat It's gonna take a superman to sweep me off my feet  (chorus)  Up where the mountains meet the heavens above Out where the lightning splits the sea I would swear that there's someone somewhere Watching me  Through the wind and the chill and the rain And the storm and the flood I can feel his approach Like the fire in my blood  (chorus)  ____________________________________________________________________  Juz watched Shrek 2 2 days ago... What else can i say... The show rox!!!

      Another day of com games and more com games and more com games... U get the idea... Waiting for Age of Mythology to install, so got a lot of free time... Damn Xian!!! Something feels missing... Life seems so meningless... Hai... Yawnz... My life revolves around the com... What kind of life goes around an inanimate object... I seriously have nothing to do if my dear com dies lah... Looks like i have to re-organise my life... Just tried to read the $75 SEA Bk... got thru all the way to page ten, intro included... Proud of myself... Maybe i can finish this Bk by next year... It's a start... Ha ha...  Mindless ramblings of someone who has nothing better to do... :-P
