      Hey guys. Whats up? Sorry for not posting in the last 3 days. I was sort of busy having a life. Guess I will have to quadruple this post.   June 25, 2004  Hello. How you all doing? Today was as boring as ever. I woke up and got dressed. My mom then dragged me and my brother along to go to Kickboxing classes. We are going to start this summer. But I honestly don't know why. I already took classes and I'm also going to take guitar lessons which will already take most of my summer. Anyway, after that we went to Food Basics to get some, well, food. Then off to K-Mart. There we got sandals for my bro and new flip-flops for me. Then we finally went home. The house was the same as always. I just went to sleep and didn't wake up till dinner. After dinner I went back to sleep. I know what your thinking, I'm such a lazy ass bum. And the truth is I am. I am still also feeling sad because of Michael. When am I ever going to get over him? Can you answer that for me? Guess not. Oh well. Hope I get over him tommorrow but I highly doubt it. Going to go now. Bye. ~Prue~   June 26, 2004  Whats up? I finally have some fun today. I went to my uncle's house. You might be thinking how is going to a family party fun. Well it is if the party is in that house. They have a huge house. My friends and I call it a mini mansion. They have a huge screen in the basement but that's not the only t.v there. They have 3 others. Each one is connected to a different X-Box. It's an arcade room actually. But the backyard is what really counts. They have an inground swimming pool with a diving board in the 11 feet deep end. They also have a basketball court. Notice I didn't say hoop, I said court. Yeah, they have an actual court with two hoops, a half court, foul line, you know the whole ordeal. The backyard is still huge even with those things. It's still big enough for two tennis courts. Anyway, I had a fun time swimming even though my painter was in. I got sunburn too. It really stings. When nightfall came we decided to stay because its a long ride back and my dad was drunk. LOL. Anyway I gotta go now. Bye. ~Prue~   June 27, 2004  Hey. At my uncle's again. I had fun today too. I did basically everything I did yesterday. That was swimming. You know what I had so much fun yesterday and today that I almost, ALMOST, forgot about Michael. He just won't leave me. Arggghhhh. I'm going now because I want to concentrate on getting him out of my head. Bye. ~Prue~   June 28, 2004  Finally went home today. Bummed because of it. And because of him. I really don't wanna say the name. I guess I'll just stay home today mastering the art of being a lazy bum again. LOL. Actually I can't be a lazy bum if I keep typing this post, so I'm going now. Bye. ~Prue~   There another post. How bout that? Wait, no. I'm not a lazy bum yet. Wait. I'm going now to go back to my lazy bum state. Bye (for real). ~Prue~

      Hey, everyone. I meant to post two days ago and yesterday but I was busy. Guess I'll just have to triple this post. So here it goes:   June 22, 2004  Hi, guys. I had a GREAT day. (hint: there was a bit of sarcasm there). Let's see, I woke up in the morning and got ready to go to school. We had a half day because it was the second to last day. School was normal. Everyone was crying there asses off because we were really going to miss the teachers, the work, homework, and the projects we have to do at the last minute because of our lazy bums. Yeah very normal. LOL! Had you for a second there, huh? Ok maybe not. But it really was normal. People were hanging out with friends, talking about pool parties, you know the whole deal. But after school was a different story. When the bell rang to signal the end of school, everyone went out in the pouring rain. We all waited for our rides, and eventually people left. But mine never got there. So I went back inside to call my mom but the phone was busy. I continued to call for at least 15 minutes but once again nothing. So I went back out to keep waiting. And guess, what my ride still didn't come. I waited for another 15 minutes but nothing. Then I realized that I probably looked like a dork standing in the rain getting soaked so I decided to start walking to my house (yes, in the rain). I passed 3 blocks when it hit me, my house was 1 mile away. I started to really kick myself that time. But i figureed there was no point in turning back so I kept walking. When I got home, my mom started to interrogate (such a big word) me like how i got there, why am i wet, and what was i doing the night of the 4th. Ok, maybe not that last bit but still. Yeah, she got pissed. Can you belive it?! I try calling her for 15 minutes straight to try to get a ride but she was on the phone talking to her friend and she gets pissed?! Oh well. Anyway other than that I had a stupid day. But I gotta go now. Bye. ~Prue~   June 23, 2004  Hello, again. Today was, well, heartbraking. It was the last day of school. The last day I will ever see Michael, the guy I liked for 2 years. He's moving. But that's not all. He likes a friend, Arriene. Of, course I can't blame him because basically every guy in school likes her. I mean all me and Michael ever was were good friends. We flirt a lot and we trust each other enough to tell each other our secrets but all we will ever be are friends. At least he gave me 2 hugs before he left. After school, I went to a pool party. But it wasnt much help to my sadness. Yeah I know I sound sooo emo but I really dont care. I had fun but when I thought about today and the last day of school and Michael, all the happiness was just swept away from me like a tidal wave that just suddenly crashed down on me. I also tried to become happy by going to my best friend house but just like the party, nothing, capische, nada. Guess I just care about him too much to forget. Well now I gotta go. Bye. ~Prue~   June 24, 2004  No more school. If it were any other year I would probably be very happy and start dancing like that guy from the Great Adventure commercial, but its not. I just can't stop thinking about him. Yesterday right before my sleep. I was thinking about him, and I cried. It wasn't the hysterical sobbing kind of cry, it was just silent tears streaming down my tanned face. (I should become a writer shouldn't I?) Anyway, I guess I'll just try to keep myself busy from thinking about him. I'm going to go now. I'm too sad to write more. Bye. ~Prue~   Whew. Well, how was that? That took a lot. But you know, I am really sad. Oh, well. I'll try to post tomorrow. Bye (for real this time). ~Prue~
