      This conveys what I am feeling right now... Change.  It is inevitable.  I am loosing control over what I used to be and who I am becoming.  I am changing, growing, becoming.  I feel something is pulling me to Georgetown, yet I fear what I will find when I get there.  So much has happened these last two years.  I often wonder how I ever made it.  Dave, Andy, Brian - without you three...You guys have carried me when I couldn't carry myself.  I have looked to you all for advice.  I will never forget you guys, wherever I may be.  Doug, what happened?  You have changed.  I don't know you anymore.  At one time we were inseparable, now I don't see you for months.  A word of advice, your girlfriend won't always be there, but I would have.  I guess you will learn the hard way, like I did.   For the first time in my life, I don't have the answers.  Only questions.  Sometimes the questions are more important than the answers.  I do know that I am looking for myself.  Who I really am.  I get a new start, a new beginning.  What will I find when I find myself.  Will I live up to everyone's expectations?    I am still holding a little back.  It's time to let it out.  Georgetown, I hope you can handle me.

      Haven't blogged in a while  Thursday: went to see "The Bourne supremacy" with Matt Daemon. It was a great CIA operative flick. In the morning I worked for the Army, it was a pretty boring day all around. I did not even go out.  Friday: Today I worked for the Army in the morning. I drove a Hummer to get an oil change. I made sure to stop at my father's house and give my brother a ride too. I went into my father's office and billed out water bills for some of his units. It is allot of math and if I ever get ambitious I could do an excel worksheet to simplify everything. I talked to Patricia, she is the best secretary ever! My father is lucky to have found her. I hit the tanning bed on the way home and put a "fore sale" sign on the house. Not much new. Ii think I need to stay in this weekend and finish the house; showings start Monday.

      Danielle and I had a conversation on relationships and this is what we came up with:    There are three basic forms of relationships:    1. " Dating " -  getting to know someone, no sex, you cannot cheat or "shmeggle."    2. " Seeing " -  you know the person, sex&nbsp;can be&nbsp;involved, shmeggling applies and cheating at the higher levels of shmeggling.    3. " boy/girl friend " -  a commitment is made to one another, definately sex,&nbsp;cheating applies and any shmeggles become cheats.    So what is "shmeggling?"&nbsp; - a made up word to describe acts frowned upon, but&nbsp;do not warrant totally breaking things off in a "seeing" relationship.&nbsp; A shmeggle might be talking to an ex, kissing, calling new numbers aquired or returning their phone calls, heavy petting, etc...&nbsp;   Cheating would warrant ending the relationship and includes; sex, oral, and hand jobs etc...&nbsp; Note: Any shmeggling becomes cheating once boy/girl friend status has been made clear.   A SHMEGGLER COULD EASILY BECOME A CHEATER!  -Danielle has 5 schmeggles to Eric's 4

      I has been a long time since I had a night in the city.&nbsp; Monday was China's big night.&nbsp; Rick and Adam have been planning a night in the city for a while.&nbsp;   China Club -> Located on 47th between 8th and Broadway.&nbsp; Local model, actor, and celebrity hangout, the Hiltons were not there tonight, sorry Adam.&nbsp; $20 dollar cover, supposedly a dress code (yea right).&nbsp; Doors are open from 10-4.&nbsp; $8 beers, $10 mixed drinks, at least.   We rolled in at 11-1130 pregamed 9 beers in the&nbsp;car and headed in.&nbsp; Rick had some free pass and he gave it to me.&nbsp; The place is set up like a China town, with pagodas, bhuddas, and dragons.&nbsp; Two main dance floors and an outside lounge with a beautiful view of the surrounding skyscrapers.&nbsp; The music was a complete mix from 80's, to house, to dance, to oldies, to hip hop- everything.&nbsp; We had a couple of drinks and moved to the VIP section for a $125 bottle of Moet.&nbsp; Danced by myself a little, Adam got shot down like ten times, especially when he grabbed some girls tits, &nbsp;and Rick got a blowjob in the bathroom (still doesn't beat Andy fucking that stripper while everyone in the bathroom watched).&nbsp; My night was pretty boring, I am not going there to hook up, so it pretty much is a waste of time and money (someone was right).&nbsp; Rick forgot his digital camera in the car, but my father is buying me one as a going away present (so this thing will finally have some color).&nbsp; I got hit on a lot, and because I was one of the youngest there, mostly older women.&nbsp; One in particular asked me "what do you think women want?"&nbsp; I tried love, time, honesty, etc... etc...&nbsp; She replied "women want to be in charge of their lives."&nbsp; Pretty profound, it only cost me a nights sleep and about $150,&nbsp;thanks drunk bitch.&nbsp; We hit a pizza place across the street for late night munchies and I passed out in the back seat.   Well I just got home so its time for bed.&nbsp; On the way home I woke up two times.&nbsp; The first time it was to DMB "Superman" and the second was to OAR "crazy game of poker" or something like that. Weird.   Andy should be coming up later tonight, I hope I can hang.&nbsp; I am definitely getting to old for this shit.&nbsp; I will be nice to settle down one day and not have to go out anymore...

      Yesterday was the Army Picnic, they gave out a shitload of awards, more than my entire five years with the Marines.&nbsp; I got to hang out with the guys and already I was asked by two not to leave the unit;&nbsp;I guess I must have really made an impression.&nbsp; Those guys really need me, I hope there is some way I can stay.&nbsp; I had to put some of them on their face, including colin (I know someone will love that).&nbsp; I kinda like some of them, the soldiers that is.&nbsp; Some general spoke and a lot of the guys had girfriends or family there.&nbsp; I was alone as usual...&nbsp; Colin told me to say hi to Danielle, I didn't have the heart to tell him we are not talking; why? I have no idea.&nbsp; I guess we are both to proud to let the other one "win."&nbsp; It's so stupid.&nbsp; We aren't talking over&nbsp;something I don't even remember,&nbsp;It was so insignificant I couldn't even tell you what it was.&nbsp;   Saturday night was pretty depressing, I wrote a blog and deleted it later because it made me seem weak.&nbsp; I was really upset, but I guess everything works out for the best in some weird way.&nbsp; My father called this morning with Georgetown crap for me to do.&nbsp; Not much else going on.&nbsp; Today I got to do some running and clean the house, it needs to be ready to show soon.&nbsp; Later I'll hit the gym and get ready for tonight.&nbsp; I'm trying to get my dad's Jag to drive up there with.   It's weird but I don't really feel like going out.&nbsp; A younger me would be ecstatic right now.&nbsp; what's wrong with me.&nbsp;   "Make yourself a better person and know who you are before you try to know someone else and expect them to know you"&nbsp;

      CARDINAL--Seventh sign of the Zodiac--AIR SIGN September 24 to October 23  &nbsp; When you are expressing the positive qualities in your life you are mainly concerned with art and creativity and maintaining a good set of values that you use as you try to relate to those around you in peace and justice. The sun being in its fall within your sign means that most of your actions are dictated by others but in order to be balanced you must learn to offset your obliging nature with an iron clad will that you will have to work hard at acquiring so that you will learn to make hard and fast decisions and not be swayed from them when push comes to shove.  &nbsp; Your sign is the only one where your symbol is an object and not a human being or an animal. This shows that you may be living your life as an immaculate concept rather than as a living, breathing, fallible, creature. You must allow yourself to make mistakes (and take full responsibility for them) just like the rest of the world; in this way, balancing your life, you will find your greatest happiness. After you have established that you have a good set of values you can rely on your natural charm to keep your romantic relationships on an even keel. &nbsp; Your sense of harmony attracts many relationships, personal one on one or in business, either way you must depend on your inner sense to balance these and create harmony in your life and surroundings. Libra is the sign of the peacemaker and a cardinal sign which means that you are supposed to be an initiator of social activities, not simply a response to them. Being the peacemaker you can solve conflicts and disagreements using your art of dealing with others rather than ignoring the problems that have shown themselves to you.  &nbsp; You must guard against letting the negative steal into your life which will definitely make you very unhappy. You could become superficial and lazy, self-indulgent and greedy, demanding and underhanded, or an insincere yes person. You have the tendency to become vain and class conscious and if you are not diligent in rooting these tendencies out early in life you could become a complaining, easily upset person who thinks he or she knows it all thus driving away the very people who are important to your happiness. You have the potential to be a wonderful, likable, and kind human being. Endeavor to live up to it.

      I had formation at 0730 today with the Army National guard.&nbsp; I am beginning to actually enjoy PARTS of the Army.&nbsp; They are a long cry from Marines but each service has its benefits.&nbsp; I am begining to like some of the guys and have already earned most of their respect.&nbsp;&nbsp; The army is more laid back, the Marine anal attitude was beginning to get to me.   I saw Colin from Mayfair, with a bunch of the other guys who worked there.&nbsp;&nbsp;He has yet to go to boot camp and kind of looks up to me as the only Corporal in the unit.&nbsp; It was funny to see him, he has a lot to learn.&nbsp; We had classes on call for fire, the 50 Cal machine gun, and the M19 automatic grenade launcher; we then proceeded to roll up HUNDREDS of cami nets, and that was drill.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tomorrow is the picnic, HOOAH.   Marko called today, he is leaving for Georgia on Monday.&nbsp; Tomorrow he is going to drive down and we are going to say our goodbyes.&nbsp; He was one of my best friends when we were both&nbsp;stationed at Camp Lejuene, both young salty Lance Corporals.&nbsp; When I left Echo two months ago he was 1st Platoon 1st Squad leader and I was 3rd Platoon 1st Squad leader.&nbsp;   We had some wild times, Marko and I: Myrtle, Charleston, DC, Harrisburg, ECU, and Chapel Hill.&nbsp; He was the one who introduced me to a lot of the "finer" things in life.&nbsp; I was with Marko on my first trip to DC, when I bought my first pair of diesels, and when I smoked my first cigar.&nbsp; He taught me a lot about life and&nbsp;has such a interesting outlook on everything.&nbsp; His stories of Europe were my reason for going.&nbsp; I can't wait to see his arrogant&nbsp;self again.&nbsp; We are going to catch up over beers, steaks,&nbsp;and cigars at the Brew Works after the Army picnic.&nbsp;   Well, now my father and I are going to finish the bathroom.&nbsp; It is so nice to have it back!&nbsp;   &nbsp;

      Yesterday I went in to the office at the Army, did some menial labor, went to Wilson High School and Notre Dame.&nbsp; I saw Mr. Kramer, great guy.&nbsp; I got lunch with Sgt. Toth and came home.&nbsp; I hardly did anything after that, most of the day was spent on the phone or sleeping.&nbsp; I went to McGrady's last night.&nbsp; I drank two beers and left by 12:30.&nbsp; Decent crowd.&nbsp; Saw Angelo, Joe Ward, Jen Fischer, and came with Seth.&nbsp;   Today I am going to work around the house.&nbsp; Dani should be stopping by later.&nbsp; Not much else going on.&nbsp; No craziness last night, just a relaxing night.&nbsp; Andy called me, he's back from Japan.&nbsp; I guess he is finally going to dump Jackie.&nbsp; So he says...&nbsp; She was crying because he hasn't seen her yet, instead he is spending time with Liz, his new fling.&nbsp; I was with him when he met her at Finnegans (she's the whole blow job, hiking, weird old man story).&nbsp; I can't wait to see him.   This weekend I have Army crap to do... Not really looking forward to that, but whatever.&nbsp; Sgt. Toth is trying to set up an interview with a Special Forces unit in Maryland.&nbsp; I will have to do ANOTHER indocrination if I want to try out.&nbsp; That means one month of training, yuck!&nbsp;   Four weeks left here, and one down south.&nbsp; Time is going so fast.

      Yeasterday I worked on the house for like twelve hours, got a lot accomplished.&nbsp; It felt good to finally accomplish something around here.&nbsp; I was at Home Depot three or four times.&nbsp; My father really worked hard, he is such a great man.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  CHAOS THEORY:   Chaos is qualitative in that it seeks to know the general&nbsp;character of a systems long-term behavior, rather than&nbsp;&nbsp;seeking numerical predictions about a future state. What&nbsp;characteristics will all solutions of a system exhibit? How&nbsp;does this system change from exhibiting one behavior to&nbsp;another?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chaotic systems are unstable since they tend not to resist&nbsp;any outside disturbances but instead react in significant&nbsp;ways. In other words, they do not shrug off external&nbsp;influences but are partly navigated by them.&nbsp;&nbsp;The variables describing the state of a system do not&nbsp;&nbsp;demonstrate a regular repetition of values and are therefore&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; aperiodic. This unstable aperiodic behavior is highly&nbsp;complex since it never repeats and continues to show the&nbsp;&nbsp;effects of the disturbance(s).&nbsp; These systems are deterministic because they are made up&nbsp;of few, simple differential equations, and make no&nbsp;&nbsp;references to implicit chance mechanisms. This is not to be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; completely equated with the metaphysical or philosophical&nbsp;&nbsp;idea of determinism (that human choices could be&nbsp;predetermined as well).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, a dynamic system is a simplified model for the&nbsp;time-varying behavior of an actual system. These systems&nbsp;&nbsp;are described using differential equations specifying the&nbsp;rates of change for each variable.   &nbsp;  I was researching the "Choas Theory" last night.&nbsp; Its a psychological theory that tries to eliminate anxiety or control by stating nature and humans are chaotic in nature.&nbsp; There are infinite outcomes to each SEEMINGLY insignificant action we make.&nbsp; We are not linear in nature.&nbsp; That Malcom guy in  Jurassic Park  was a chaos theorist.&nbsp; The  Butterfly Effect  is a movie about this, too.&nbsp; The "butterfly effect" was coined by some astrologer at MIT, he said a butterfly flapping its wings on one side of the world, chaotically, &nbsp;can cause a typhoon on the other.&nbsp; Deep shit.&nbsp; It makes one really analyze each action they do.&nbsp; Life is so unpredictable, often in my own, I try to control things I am now realizing I have no control over.&nbsp; Its hard to live in the "now,"&nbsp; especially within a society so geared on the future.&nbsp; Also I wonder if chaos can describe fate?&nbsp; Maybe our lives are predetermined and chaos is the "force" that acts upon us keeping our path the same.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nature is chaotic, order, is a dream of man.&nbsp; This means my life should always be a roller coaster.&nbsp; The bumps are chaos, how I react, is who I am -&nbsp;that is life.&nbsp; Life is a reaction.&nbsp; To master self control is to master life.&nbsp; To master life one must master themselves.&nbsp; I can only control my own actions, I must learn how to react appropiately to the actions of others.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am starting to understand...  &nbsp;  Last night was a perfect example.&nbsp; I am analyzing one INSIGNIFICANT event and all of the outcomes.&nbsp; It affected like 10 people!!!&nbsp; This is AMAZING.&nbsp; Chaos at work...&nbsp; I couldn't have dreamed of a better example.&nbsp; Ten lives each effected by one dance.&nbsp; Fucking amazing... And the apparent lack of self control, obviously by people who are extremely far from self actualization.&nbsp; My reaction could have been a little better, but I am definitely improving.&nbsp; I can't believe it...DEFINITELY NEED MORE RESEARCH ON CHAOS.

      Thursday: I went up to Main Gate.&nbsp; I met up with Jason, Rick and Adam, and I drove with Dave and Brian.&nbsp; I saw Cristin, Kristin,&nbsp;Nadeen&nbsp;and Stacy there.&nbsp; We pre-gamed at&nbsp;McGrady's with $3 pitchers.&nbsp; I have no idea what happened at the end of the night, I left and went home and I assumed Dave &amp; Brian were going home with chicks.&nbsp; Somehow I "abandoned them."&nbsp; Dave calls me at 2:45 and drunkenly starts telling me about how they are walking home and people are "laughing at them."&nbsp; I must have done an Indy 500 around that club 3 times before I left, and then I waited 10 minutes in my car.&nbsp; I offered to pick them up, instead, they told me to leave my door open and they never show up.&nbsp; (what PROBABLY happened: Dave &amp; Brian THOUGHT they were going to get ass, so they talked to some random girls until about 2:35 when they realized they weren't) I guess they expect me to be the&nbsp;driver and just wait around, right.  &nbsp;  Friday: I was getting bored painting my bathroom and Seth and Chris called me up.&nbsp; They were at McGrady's so I met up with them.&nbsp; So I guess crack head Jarett has been telling people I think I am "THE SEXIEST MAN IN THE LEHIGH VALLEY"(i have no idea where that came from)&nbsp;and I won't hang out with certain people.&nbsp; What the fuck?&nbsp; I get into McGradys and Seth and Chris are yelling that at me.&nbsp; I learn the story, and it was funny until they started telling random girls that I was actually voted the title, then it was just embarrassing. &nbsp;I was not drunk enough for that.&nbsp; So Steph (the ex ex) shows up, obviously checking on me with her fat samoan friend Ruth, who I HATE.&nbsp; Guy's buy them shots and then they run out when Kristin (Penn State cheerleader who I used to talk to), who was at Main Gate yesterday, comes up and says hi to me.&nbsp; Steph calls me drunk crying later that night, telling me I am a cheat and always will be?&nbsp; What the fuck?  &nbsp;  Well after McGrady's we stop at the HO, beat.&nbsp; I saw the loser Notre Dame High School (my alma matter)&nbsp;crowd, still going NOWHERE with their lives.&nbsp; I have never seen it so empty, then I remember about some getto flyer that some idiot left on my car Thursday night.&nbsp; It was like drawn with a marker and touted some band called 730 playing at Banana Joes.&nbsp; We end up there at midnight and Chris is the only one who pays, he comes out, we lick our hands and rub the little red star on both of our hands - extra beer money.&nbsp; banana Joes had a decent crowd.&nbsp; Seth saw Jess, one of the waitresses at McGrady's, who he is MADLY in love with.&nbsp; I tell him to go talk to her and all he manages to say is "where are you going" as she starts walking.&nbsp; She replies with "the bathroom."&nbsp; That kids got game!&nbsp; Steph shows up here too, so I danced with her for a little and her fucking friend Ruth gave me the finger.&nbsp; Next time I see that fat bitch I am definitely dumping a beer on her.&nbsp; Why the fuck can't she mind her own business?&nbsp;&nbsp;Seth gets his ass grabbed by some faggot, he finds him in the parking lot and bitch slaps the guy right across the face.&nbsp; The two girls the gay guy is with start defending him and step in front of him.&nbsp; They start yelling, Seth starts yelling, and the gay guy starts yelling "I'm Gay! So what."&nbsp;&nbsp;What a scene! We leave and as we are walking away one of the girls yells to Seth, "you look gay anyway."&nbsp; Well, drama, it follows me wherever I go.&nbsp; It was pretty funny watching that though.&nbsp; Cris and Seth are going to West Chester tonight and invited me to tag along.&nbsp; I'm not sure what I am going to do today.&nbsp; Got to finish the house and hopefully get in touch with my roomamate at Georgetown, they are paring me up with a senior, thank god.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Some random individual loves Bethlehem locals.&nbsp; I'm not sure if this person is trying to be funny or a tough guy.&nbsp; I say what I want and always will.&nbsp; If it gets me into trouble, I am a Marine Sniper, and if I can handle Iraqi insurgents with Ak 47's I'm PRETTY confident NO ONE in the Lehigh Valley is much of a threat.

      Yesterday I was to hung over to get anything done on the house.  I have like two weeks left until I need to get it on the market. Today I don't feel so hot either, but got some painting done.  My stupid ex keeps calling from freakin Texas, or wherever she is (like I care!).  I don't get that girl.  I pick up the phone to hear that southern twang going "this is a call of pride."  A call of pride?  What the f**k does that mean?  And why are you calling?  Call Evan, your GHBusingmillionairenewyorkersextoy, don't call me and f**k up yet another relationship in my life.  God.  Oh and while you bragging about your stupid air force money, get a life.  Oh, and DELETE my number! Again.  Ryan Kipp, 20 year old former fellow Abercrombie worker and Muhlenburg frat boy that now works at Hollister, stopped by last night.  It was great to hang out with him again.  It's been like 4 months.  We caught up over a few beers at Mothers.    Mothers-> Located in the circle of downtown Easton.  Drinky Drinkersons is owned by the same people.  Very small, long bar and tiny "dance floor" used for different things on different nights.  Cute waitresses, ghetto Easton/P-burg trash crowd in the summer, rich Lafayette kids during the school year.    Ryan tried to make friends with the waitress, Nikki, who works at DD and Victoria Secret, and was shot down hard.  So he made some other friends.  We nature hiked to Wawa on College Hill for late night muchies, and some 14 year old high schoolers were nice enough to give us a ride back.  More drunken phone calls and we both passed out.  Ryan woke me up at like 9 with a nice glass of cool-aid he made(thanks for spilling it all over the kitchen!).  We talked, I gave him a sniper t-shirt and he left.  Great guy.  Already Rick is talking Main Gate tonight.  Ryan wants to do something too.  I just don't know if my body can handle three nights out in a row.  Plus, I'm starting to look "shady" to certain individuals.  When they get older they will understand.  NO MORE ALCOHOL!!!  I'm done for a while.  Time to get the house done, then I can party.  Priorities.    I talked to my prospective rommy, Jordan, at GU, who I find out is 18!!!!  Great, he seemed weirded out when I told him I was 23.  I can't wait to live with a bunch of kids.

      Dave an Eric decide to get some wings at McGradys, not drink to much, but still have a good time...Eric ends up piss drunk, head spinning at 2:30 in the morning.  How did this happen?  McGrady's -> local Bethlehem Irish pub located on 3rd street.  Lehigh University hang out.  22 beers on tap.  Tuesday is wing nite 1.50/10 wings and $3 pitchers.  Well last nite...  Wow, allot of tactical mistakes, as Andy would say. Dave was definitely the star clown making me the sidekick in an all out "mcgrady's brothers circus."  It kind of reminded me of the scene in American Pie, where the dork girl tells the dork guy, "say my name bitch."  Thing's learned:  1)Do not buy girls drinks - Dave out $80. 2)Do not chase girls - Dave used and home alone. 3)definitely make conversation - he who hesitates, masturbates. 4)Do not call people at 2:15 AM asking them to "hang out" - Dave considered a scumbag loser who couldn't find a girl at the bar. 5)The locals suck. 6)Angry wierdo's can still be useful - one bought me a drink. 7)Shots bad - beer good. 8)Dress like a college student at a college bar - Dave, you have been there before, it is not my job to analyze every outfit of yours before we leave.  Dave= DUG (dressed up guy) 9)The popcorn is addicting.  Every nite out is training.  Each time I learn something new.  Yea, Dave might not have had wild crazy sex, but he taught me about women.  What to do and what not to.  Learning by watching is always better than learning by listening.    The nite was going good, nice crowd, no bomshells, but what you expect on a Tuesday?  I'm talking to someone anyway so, not "hawking" right now.  So I start talking to some friends when Dave gets the bright idea to have a "drinking contest" and I drunkenly decide the alcohol is on us.  Big mistake.  Dave gets some girl who keeps walking up to him and saying "where's my shot." (American Pie) Dave is now totally being used for free alcohol and is to drunk to put the slut in her place.  I am all over the place; talking to random KU teachers and angry drunk kids and guys who look like they just left the hospital...  Dave nearly clubs this girl and drags her home, but wait, she was just using him.  Oh well.  Maybe Thursday Dave will get some ass.

      I've met some AMAZING people this last month, made some great friends.  I just don't know why I had to meet them before I leave.  Life sucks.  It always seems to be this way.  Everytime something right happens, something wrong does to even it out.  It's if my life is a perpetual roller coaster.  I am never high or low for any great amount of time.  I've opened up and explained myself who knows where it will get me or if I should have.    Fate, if its real then I've already made these decisions, or, they have been made for me.  Am I the master of my own destiny?  Do I meet certain people for certain reasons?  The search for the meaning of life is the greatest quest a man can undertake, the only one that has never been finished.  Maybe there is no answer.  I am supposed to meet Jen at the beach.  I guess I better call and figure out what I'm doing.  Also, I need a damn cell phone...  I guess one can only go so long in the stone age.  Last year on this day, I was sitting on top of the museum in An Nasariah Iraq, wondering if I will ever be home and free.  I try to remember what I learned in Iraq everyday.  Nothing should EVER be taken for granted, life is short live everyday as if its your last, and everything we have are gifts.    Finding a roommate at GU is not any easy task.  I am emailing a bunch of guys.  Hopefully I will find the right one.  You can only learn so much about a person from a computer screen.  Remember that.    My father is the best man in the world.  I am so lucky to have him.  Sunday, he is coming over to help me finish parts of the house.  The damn power went out yesterday, and I'm sure certain people are already making assumptions.  I can't wait to deal with that...

      Time is going so fast, it seems like it was only yesterday I got the letter of acceptance from Georgetown.  Its funny, but two times in my life, life changing events started with a letter.  First when I recieved my orders to the Middle East, and second, Georgetown's acceptance.   Things are going well.  I feel more and more confident about my decisions.  The only thing that sucks is I am twenty three, in college and NOT a doctor.  The thing is, I wouldn't give up my military experience to be any younger, I needed it and better to be young in combat than married with kids or something worse.   Andy has drill this weekend, and I am trying to get out of my own next weekend.  I am going to start packing soon, the time is close.

      The greatest of all emotions, the one that can make a man crazy. Love can override the brain, it can take control of the body. It is a duality, the most wonderful feeling in the world and when it goes bad; it is the greatest pain a man can endure. When someone is in love they yearn, they need their love like food, it keeps them alive. The worst feeling in the world is to have that not returned. It hurts more than any physical pain that can be felt. It consumes every thought. For me, it's in the stomach, like a man grabbing my insides and twisting them over and over again until all I feel is pain. It feels like something is trying to get out of me, yet all it manages to do is claw my insides. When that feeling subsides, I am left with no energy, the feeling leaves and it takes part of my life force with it. I am left a baby, crying to be held or touched, to feel loved once again.  Love - the world cannot function without it, yet it causes so much pain. It seems God levels every scale of life. Yin and Yang.  Today I had an epiphany. There are very few times in my life where I learn such lessons. I grew today as a human. I realized what love is and what it feels like, I never knew before today what love meant and what it is to love. I can see love. Maybe because of my childhood it took me this long, but today pieces in my life came together and I can see the big picture now. Today was a milestone. I often wonder if others can understand what I think about, to many I probably seem like a psycho, babbling about nonsense. Intelligence is a curse, it is a responsibility. I wonder what others lives would be like if they knew what I know, if they could feel like I feel, if they could see what I see.  "Perfect love is rare indeed - for to be a lover will require that you continually have the subtlety of the very wise, the flexibility of the child, the sensitivity of the artist, the understanding of the philosopher, the acceptance of the saint, the tolerance of the scholar and the fortitude of the certain."  urlLink  - urlLink Leo Buscaglia

      Just got back from Kiawah. It was a long drive home but for some reason I can't sleep. Actually I know the reason but you would think that with only four hours of sleep I would be dead tired, but my mind is in a million places.  Thursday we stopped at Myrtle, got a hotel at Broadway and went out. I got really drunk and tore some sign off a building and got chased, Andy picked up some girl and got a hand job.  Friday we got to the island, went out Friday &amp; Saturday night to Charleston, nothing to exciting except when Andy drove the loaner car drunk into forty barrels on the side of the road - messed it up pretty bad. I did meet a Georgetown alumni who invited me to a party at his house in Georgetown on the 27th. He is really well connected at the school and I can't believe my luck in running into such a cool guy.  All in all it was a good time, I needed to get away. I drank way to much, but that's what vacations are for right? I was a COMPLETE angel, and I still managed to get dumped as did Andy. I had a bad feeling about this trip. I guess I am looking for a girl who will one day go on vacation with me. I am so sick of the "single" life, Andy can't understand. The only thing that really sucked was I dropped my new phone in the ocean and they wont let me get insurance on it.  tomorrow is court, it is not going to trial. I had to call all of my witness' and friends to tell them not to come. I guess the DA must be plea bargaining.

      Tomorrow morning I leave for Kiawah Island. My father has a beach house there, and this will be my last chance to go to the beach before I leave for Georgetown. I am not really looking forward to the trip because of all the things on my mind and the people at home who I have so little time left with. I am going with Andy and I'm sure he will cheer me up once we are on the road.  I put the house on the market and it sold in one day for full price to the fist person who saw it. Not bad. Settlement is August 31st. So much to do so little time.  My parents have been wonderful, so supportive of everything in my life. Everyone around me has added something. Its as if all the pieces of some great puzzle are coming together. I feel calm; at ease with my life, even though a move to a new city, two court cases, and rocky relationship are all before me. I feel I have made the right decisions and I will be happy with what the outcomes will be. Honestly, I have never before felt so at ease. Everything just feels right.
