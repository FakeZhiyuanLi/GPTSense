      Well, after the debates, subsequent newspaper articles, and discussions, I have solidly decided upon the Conservative Party as being the best choice.  In other news, my job hunt is coming along.  It strikes me as amazing sometimes, that it doesn't matter how many times you go through the same situation, there is always something new to pull out of it.  I dislike thinking about "what next", but I have to.  This mini-contract that I am on isn't going to last forever.  My interview with Math and Stats went well, and I have an interview with Neurology (I think) on Friday.  In the meantime, I am starting to like what I am doing in Family Medicine.  Lots of little bits of everything.  If only someone could/would call a ceasefire on the wretched politicking.    They say Death and Taxes are the only two sure things in life.  I disagree.  You can evade Taxes.  Death and Politics:  They walk hand in hand as Universal Constants.

      Odd things happen when you stop relying on your parents for information and start looking at things on your own.  I might actually follow Herman's lead this election and decline my ballot in a vote of no-confidence.  Or I may vote Conservative.  My sister posted a link to all the parties running in my area. I would vote Green party, if they weren't for Gay marriage.  EVERYTHING else on their list falls in line with my political views. But I feel VERY strongly against that, so I won't be voting for them. The Liberal Party is out of the question!!  I have no confidence in their ability to do anything. I question the Conservative Party.  I am a bit uncertain about a few of their policies.  Of all the parties, I hold most to the Conservative party platform.  I do doubt their ability to carry it out in full. I am completely ANTI-NDP.  What we need is a Conservative-Green party of Canada.  Or a Social-Conservative party.  Something that takes all the best of each and combines them into one solid platform.

      This is awkward.  I have decided I could like this office very much.  It will certainly be a very interesting position.  Yet there remains a rather stark shadow.  I have yet to sign anything agreeing the the terms and conditions of my employment.  There is a verbal contract that I shall work until February 28, 2005 at $16.85/hr.    Last night I got a phone call from the Math and Stats office for an interview.  They wanted me to come in on Thursday.  I cannot go on Thursday, but we compromised on Friday.  She was incredibly accomodating.  I cannot find my information sheet for this job, so I do not know if it is full-time or a contract.  If it is full-time, I sincerely hope I get it.  I may not take it if it is a contract (unless they offer me a sheet of paper and more than I am making now).  I am a bit confused as to the moral implications of taking an interview after one has been offered a job.  On the one hand, they have yet to provide me with a formal, written contract.  On the other hand, I have made a verbal commitment to them and they have made a verbal commitment to me.  On the one hand, this is only a contract.  On the other hand, the intent is to make it a full-time job in February, and the implication was made that I would be hired full-time at that time.  Advice would be appreciated.

      Time, it moves onward tick-tocking like a heartbeat. Stop for this moment, Let me see your eyes, see the passion and the depth. Let me touch your face. Moments move forward like sand through the hourglass. Stop and let me breathe. Let me bask in warmth Let me taste the memory: then, now, and again. Each moment is dear for moments make a lifetime and lifetimes shall pass. Here we stand as one You are my friend, my love, and I, your love, your friend.

      There is nothing like the unexpected to perk one right up.  I have a new job now.  It was confirmed this morning, I start one week from today.  I have a front desk and a fairly nice computer.  The chair looks quite comfortable.  I will be doing a variety of tasks, but mostly I will be assisting the program co-ordinator.  My paycheck has been bumped up to a little over $2/hr more than I am making now, which is nice.  If all that extra money goes directly into savings, I should have a nice comfortable pillow in about a year.   The beautiful thing about this job is that it came out of no where.  It is such an amazing blessing!!!

      It's beautiful out again.  I love beautiful weather like this.  The only problem is, the weather channel keeps hinting at rain tomorrow.  I am supposed to go to Wonderland tomorrow, so rain woudl DEFINATELY be bad.  I'm waiting to hear back on a job I applied for.  I might call them later.

      It's early by some people's standards.  Rather late by mine.  It is so beautiful outside.  I love my office, I have a view of the entire escarpment from here.  It's only mediocre in the winter, but in the spring it is LOVELY!  I don't really have alot to do today.  I haven't really had alot to do in a while.  I do admit to feeling a wee teeny tiny bit guilty over my complete lack of work, but when I'm not given work, how can I complete it?  So I spend my days posting on forums and playing games.  My new online "home" is the Canadian Idol forum.  I joined one week ago today and I am at 200 posts.  I either totally rock or totally suck, I haven't decided yet.    I have had other blogs over the years, but they inevitably fade away, probably because I am not convinced anyone reads them.  This one serves a different purpose.  It is a gathering spot for pictures, poetry, and prose.  All my random writings will go here.

      Everyone needs a pedicure once in their lifetime.  It's truly an awesome experience.  I got my fingernails and toes done today.  They are very pretty.  It's hard not to be vain.  My hands look so nice and my toes just feel great!! :D  In other news, I've been asked (again!) to join the Campus Crusade staff as an Affiliate member.  They have started a message board and would like me to basically take the reins of it.  They want me to be a moderator and really get it going.  To do this, I must be Staff.   I am going to think and pray about it.  I am uncertain.  I have been asked SOO many times in so many ways.  I don't want to take on a commitment I cannot fulfill.

      I have to admit, I ceased liking my job almost a month ago. ...oh wait, I only started my job a month ago. &nbsp; Anyway, I got a new one and felt an informative post was in order.&nbsp; I start 2 weeks from today.&nbsp; August 3rd.&nbsp; I'm pretty excited. This could be the start of a very nice career.

      My sister is married and gone to mexico for her honeymoon. My other sister leaves to return to Washington this afternoon. We are going out for lunch later, and I am very much looking forward to it.  The wedding was beautiful. I really liked the vows. They were beautiful. The ceremony went off without a hitch, which was the most important thing. The reception was good. The food was great! I enjoyed it alot. We had all sorts of left over fruit and cookies.   :D   I'm totally not complaining on that one. The watermelon was nice. Sarah and Naomi did a really really great Spice-Girls lip-sync. It was so awesome! I've got some fantastic pictures. :D  Speaking of pictures, Herman made the observation, we will not be getting the same photographer. The photographer himself is fantastic. He does superb work!! However, "Mrs. Photographer" is horrible. She was rude and bossy and just downright ignorant. She wouldn't let him take any of his own pictures.  Like.... for real!! He ended up sadly disapointed with only 71 shots.  I got around 80ish.   Most of mine were casual shots. They were really nice. :)  Anyway, all in all, it was fantastic.  The evening just blew my mind. The reception ended around 7 or so. We cleaned up and went back to the house. Took about 30 minutes to tidy through the house, so that wasn't bad at all. We were all wiped. My feet were a tad swollen and quite sore from wearing heels all day.Herman sat me down on the couch and washed and massaged my feet. It was without a doubt the sweetest, most loving thing anyone has ever, ever done for me. I am so loved! So blessed!!I couldn't believe it. He absolutely embodies love in his actions towards me. I just hope I can show him to the same degree how much I care for him.
