      Well.  An interesting development in Tessaland: my parents are now sending me to a therapist.  This doesn't entirely surprise me; there are plenty of things in my past that indicate a necessity for therapy at some point in my life.  What I'm wondering is why  now .  It's not like I've been acting out or anything.  As far as I know they still don't know about my eating problems, and that's mostly over now anyway.  As is the cutting.  I mean, to be honest, I could have really used a therapist a lot more  last  year, or the year before that.  So why now, when I've almost managed to handle everything myself?  (Okay, not entirely by myself, but what I mean is without professional counseling.)  Anyway.  First session is tomorrow.  I must admit I'm not entirely un-nervous.  I've never actually been to a shrink, which if you think about it is pretty surprising in itself.  I mean, don't kids usually get counseling when their parents die?  Especially if they're little.  Weird.  I suppose maybe I can ask my shrink about that.  My shrink.  I have a shrink now.  Yes...weird.

      I feel restless today.  Summer doesn't agree with me.  It's not that I in any way pretend to enjoy school, even that parts those are supposed to be enjoyable (being...lunch, I suppose) but now that it's over I find I simply have nothing to  do  with myself.  I've been shying away from drawing lately, I don't know why.  It seems like I can't just  draw  anymore, for pleasure.  I don't know if that's what I mean.  I mean, I still enjoy drawing, but...I guess what I mean to say is I've lost the concept of  doodling .  Everything I draw has to aim towards being a complete, portfolio-worthy sketch.  So, with the lack of constructive outlets for my restless energy, my time has been being spent mostly lurking about online reading comics, missing Rosalee, wasting time with friends I don't really care about, and cooking like mad.  I feel so fat lately.  I haven't purged in forever, which is good I suppose, but sometimes days go by when all I eat is junk that I've baked, because I'm too scared to add regular, nutritious meals to my list of daily calories and I don't have the discipline not to sample whatever I'm concocting.  Consequently, I've been feeling a little ill lately.

      Just saw Harry Potter.  Oh.  My.  God.  Such hotness has not been contained in a single movie since Return of the King.  (Although the hotness there was mostly male, which isn't quite as good.  I found Galadriel and Arwen to be a little cold for my tastes.)  Harry Potter=hot.  Ron=hot.  Hermione=hot.  (Although, probably best wait 'til they're all a few years older until I commence my cradle-robbing fantasies.  At this point any attraction to them is still just this side of icky.)  Weasley twins=hot.  Even Sirius and Lupin are pretty damn hot in an older-dude kind of way.  (You'd think they would've chosen younger actors, considering they were supposed to be relatively youngish in the books- and, of course, nearly every girl who's read them is in love with either Sirius or Lupin, so they were probably all hoping for someone like, say, Stuart Townsend to give life to their fantasies of Sirius.)    Anyway.  I just e-mailed Rosalee the link to this website a couple hours ago, and I highly doubt she's all that keen on sitting through a passionate ramble about my movie-star crushes.  (Rosethorn, lovely, if you're listening, you still leave them all in the dust.)

      Dude.  I am not liking this whole title concept.  Now whenever I feel the urge to ramble about something pointless on my little corner of the web, I'm confronted by that menacingly expectant little bar demanding that I conjure a witty and pertinent title for my innocent ramblings.  It's so much WORK.  Anyway.  I bought the Nightmare Before Christmas on DVD at Wal-Mart today.  (Cue happy dances and rejoicing.)  If I haven't mentioned it (which, considering this is the second paragraph I've ever written here, I probably haven't) Tim Burton is my god.  Now that I'm almost done with high school and faced with the looming prospects of college and career-ness, I'm finally starting to accept that being an artist in itself probably isn't going to bring in a substantial living.  And in that case, animation definitely seems like a glorious second option to me.  But then, I could be wrong.  I could be picturing me dreaming up worlds of wonder to be brought to life at my command, while in reality I would be another monkey chained to a desk endlessly tracing some other dope's drawing of a bunny who wears overalls.  In other news, I fear I'm becoming addicted to  urlLink Mac Hall.   It's kind of alarming how  many hours can slip by while I flip through page after page of goodness.  Sigh.  Time to go check my e-mail one last obsessive time for any word from Rosalee, then dry dishes for my psychotically hormonal mother (I was so hoping, after seeing some reruns of That 70's Show, that I'd be out of the house before she went through menopause) then labor away on my [censored] math homework.
