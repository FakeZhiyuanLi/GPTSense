       Loser List of Shame Continues:    Friends-who-requested-upgrade-in-relationship-and-drove-me-loco-in-the-process:    Redial-Carl:   Carl seemed like a nice lad.  But it seems the redial button on his phone was stuck.  Carl, calling a girl every hour and leaving voicemails does NOT send the message that you're thinking about her.  It just says:  I am a crazy-stalking-s-o-b-so-run-run-as-fast-as-you-can.   Stuck-on-myself-Stephen:   Vroom, vroom.  Look at me!  I have a six-figure-salary-a-Porsche-Carrera-but-no-discernable-personality.  See ya later Stephen.  It is not all about you.  It is all about ME!  Money doesn't make a man.  (Unless it's billions! $_$ )   Hairy-Tortoise-Boy:     Some of you know him and I don't want to hurt his feelings so I won't mention his name.  But, HTB, you're just creepy.  Really, really, creepy.  Sorry man but you just make my skin crawl.   Psycho-S-man:   Boy, did I read  you  wrong.  I thought you were a little over-sensitive but I definately did not see your hissy fit coming.  I still disagree with your assertion that I must be a racist bitch because I wouldn't date you.  A comment which I found ironic coming from you with all your anti-(insert race/religion here) rhetoric.  I'm glad you hate me.   End result:  Upgrades, denied. Friendships, terminated.   Haha, aren't you all glad that you're not me?!   CoMOOdy Relief:  Last night, I got caught smuggling beef jerky. My parents banned it from my diet on account of bad meat quality and probable mad cow infection as a result of the aforementioned low quality jerky treat. But it is so salty and delicious.  I can't resist it. So I hid some under my pillow as a late-night snack.  I did not count on the fact that my mom might decide to lay down in my toasty warm bed (electric blanket) because Papa Kim made the grave mistake of unplugging the blanket in their room. I took a dive for my pillow to hide the contraband but my skittish actions only drew further attention to my hidey-spot.  Alas, the jerky was discovered and I was forced to run with it while dodging my parents lazy attempt at beating me with their fists.  I guess they're getting old.  Or perhaps, they've just stopped caring.   Unwelcome Voicemail:  The sound of the ocean hitting the surf along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. It's snowing in Orillia and I get to listen to the ocean on my answering machine. Thanks, you jerk.  I hope you get a sunburn.

       Express Food:  The Food of the Future?   I was at a gas bar today when I saw a sign:  McDonald's  Express  Not just McDonald's but McDonald's Express. Fast food isn't fast enough for us anymore! Haha.  People of the 21st century.  Progress. I didn't check it out - but you can just imagine the quality of express food - express to an early death is more like it! The burgers have taken on pill-form: designed to disolve on your tongue instantaneously, making its way directly to your arteries without the hassle of chewing and swallowing.   Wanted:  Losers Apply Here!   These words must be written somewhere on MY forehead. It would explain the fact that the cretins who find  me  most interesting are always jobless, toothless, hairy, crater-faced  losers ?!  Admittedly, they're not ALL like that - just one - but even one is ONE TOO MANY!  Frankly, it's insulting. After all, even  I  have my limits!  I have more than my share of bad seeds coming my way: My list of  ex-con-would-be-suitors :  Tim, who told me he was "out west" in B.C. for the past few years (his mom told me he was in prison);  Thom, who went to jail for a stint in years past because he impregnated a minor (the girl was a former classmate of mine); Mr. 13 1/2, he has that number tattooed in the corner of his left eye (in apparent celebration of the number of years he spent in prison).  It's so hard to choose just one.  Watched Dr. Phil yesterday.  He had a big-time loser on his show:  Jeremy, a 28 year old unemployed virgin who lives with his mom.  When he complained about not having a girlfriend, Dr Phil asked him if he would even  want  to date someone who would actually consider dating him at this point. Hahaha.  What a loser.  I point my finger and laugh at him.  Cry me a river, Jeremy.  Cry me a river.  With my luck, Jeremy would consider me a perfect match.  *barf* Perhaps, me and Jem are just peas in the same pod and I just don't know it. Now THAT is a depressing thought.  In the meantime, I'm gonna continue to dodge sleazy come-ons from forty-something-thrice-divorced-cab-drivers while I'm ringing in smokes at the Ye Olde Variety Store.  Shining Knight, I await you.   Someone whispers, "I don't think he's hanging around Orillia."  Bring on that Express Burger.  I'm ready for it now.   Advice to Friend:  Just kill her.  Justifiable homicide. (Weapon of choice:  Take her out for some Express Food)

       I am seeing RED!    Just saw Mr. American Idol II on t.v. - Was feeling bad for Reuben since he was stiffed by the Idol producers/promoters/etc. when my roommie mentioned that pansy-flat-ass-pale-skinned-prissy-faced-Clay-D-Lang. Ooooh! I HATE HIM! Mr. Aiken. Mr. Punch-me-in-the-face. Mr. Put-me-on-Broadway-so-I-can-prance-and-wear-gloss.  I was never a bully. But that  creature  brings out the animal rage in me. My feral predator instincts make me want to WEED that boy out of our gene pool - he is weak. He is a sissy. And I want to pound him into a mushy pulp with an aluminum baseball bat... make that a bat with spikes on the end of it... to hell with the bat! Let's make it a mace. Crush him!   I am eager to help him BECOME "invisible".  Now  that  would be a very good thing. [FREE MARTHA!]    Advice for a friend:   Practice saying these words, " Don't touch me without my permission " or the ever effective,  "NO!"    However, girls in general don't really understand rejection; you might have to reinforce verbal communication with physical demonstration (I'll lend you my mace for this purpose).    Penis update:   It fell off in the shower.  Dammit, I didn't even get to write my name in the snow!

      Phenomenon 1:  My ear whistled today. I didn't even know that was physically possible.  While I was blowing my nose - my ear whistled.  Who knew?  Now both you and I do.  Was gonna go to my doctor (not about the ear whistling - but about my sickness in general) - However, he is currently on vacation. Grrr...  Phenomenon 2: I have a penis. According to some spam mail, I have a penis.  But not one that I'm happy with.  I have a penis that I want to enlarge. Well, after many years of denial, I took a brave step forward and clicked my way to happiness.  Now, I am happy to report that I really can "make a tripod jealous".  Perhaps I should make an appointment to see my doctor about this "penis".  I guess it will have to wait until March Break is over though.  Big thanks to Lil' sister Rolo - for telling me how to update my Blog - information without which I could not have shared the news of my ear whistle or my sub-sized-man-wich.  Boom, baby!

       22 going on 15?   Thanks to my Asian genetics, no one will be able to guess my age correctly.  When I was 14, people thought my 10 year old brother was my son and my 40ish father was my husband (ewwww!!!!).  Now that I'm 22, people think my 19 year old brother is my older brother and my father is, well, my father.  [Nice one, Papa Kim.] When I was 17, I was never ID'ed at the LCBO, but at 22, I get ID'ed for PG-14 movies. Ridiculous much?  Right now, I am enraged because I was denied a rental at Blockbuster by some power-hungry-teen-turd (obviously taking his first job way too seriously).  The movie was rated R. I didn't bring my license with me and the kid wouldn't cut me a break.  Argh!!  Who gets ID'ed at a video store?!  So, I'm gonna watch Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.  I'll be able to relate to the characters because I'm sure everyone gets their ages wrong too.  Protecting the streets of NYC from the Foot at the tender age of 14?  I wouldn't believe them either.   The  urlLink Beastmaster  and Me:   His name is  urlLink Dar . He is a man made just for me: loyal, fights evil-doers, communicates with animals and wears a  loin cloth ! Some may scoff at my choice in Sunday Morning programming, but I know this show is a winner (even though it only lasted 3 brilliant seasons).  So tune in tomorrow on the New VR for re-runs!  Sundays at 10am.  I know I will!!  *drool*   Good-bye Shoes:   After another sleepless night, I have decided to return the shoes that I bought so hastily.  If I have this much anxiety over a pair of shoes, then I know I can't afford to keep them.  Besides, they weren't  that  cute. *sniff*   Don't worry, I'll come visit you in the store.    Melrose.  Rose of my heart.

       Knees Knocking, Heart Pounding:   It's not love.  It's a nervous breakdown.  It's official, my body hates me.  Since, I am being forced to be a "morning person", I have woken up deligently at 06:00h.  [An unholy time to be waking up, but a perfectly reasonable time to be winding down after a night of wholesome goodness.]  You would assume that since I am exhausted at the end of my day I would be able to sleep soundly.  Yet, even today, without a nap and with my brain half-comatose,  I still can't sleep ! *sob*   Orillia:  The Other Richmond Hill*   Read all about our urlLink Sunshine City .

       1 down... 14240 days to go:   I'm counting down until the day that I retire.  Hopefully it will be less than 14240* days. I have plans to shorten my "workforce" life commitment: Plan A: Win the lotto Blan B: Marry  urlLink Paul Newman  (odds of that are similar to winning the lotto).  I bought new  shoes .  :(  I cannot believe I splurged.  I'm getting a headache just thinking about how much money I spent.  It just confirms the fact that I should  NEVER  be allowed to go into a shopping mall on my own.  I think I have all this will power - but really, when it comes to shoes**, I am helpless. [For those of you who know exactly how much I spent on these not-pretty-enough-to-cost-this-much-but-ohhhh-so-comfy-shoes:  If you tell, I will be forced to silence you,  forever !]  * 14240 is the projected estimate of the number of days I will have to work in my lifetime (if I work full-time for the next 40 years). ** Replace 'shoes' with whatever I am browsing at the time.   Sorry, I'm not funny today.  I am so tired.  And I am still coming to terms with the end of my life.  Working, for the  REST  of my life.  *sob*   Snacky-time-Sara:   We both have scary nightmares.  Maybe it's from eating McDonald's right before we go to bed? Mmm... salty goodness.  I take that back!  Mc D fries can only bring happiness.  I'm lovin' it!  Buh-duh-dup-ba-daaaah~

       End of Days:   Today is the last day of my life as I know it. I start the 9 to 5 tomorrow. When am I going to study?  When am I going to see my friends? Most importantly, when am I going to  sleep ?!  On the other hand, this is the  perfect  excuse to buy new shoes!

       When Bad Smells Happen in Small Spaces:   There are some things that people should not do.  Farting in small spaces is definitely one of them. I was assaulted twice today.  First , in an elevator.  Some middle-aged woman who was marinated in a musky perfume released a silent-killer.  It was horrible.  I was grateful that it was one those modern, speedy-makes-your-stomach-lurch elevators.  I ran outta there hella-fast.  I thought I had escaped doom. But when I was on the subway, some fiend let loose a gaseous-horror of gargantuan proportions.  There was no escape.  And I couldn't even give the culprit the evil-eye because the train was so packed you couldn't tell where the smell was hitting you from.  However, it was fun to watch the yuppies try to "ignore" the smell.  Everyone knew it was there.  No one wanted to acknowledge its presence. Must keep composure. I say, next time someone ought to just say what everyone is thinking:  Ah Jeez, that stinks!  Who farted?  Come here so I can smack you around like a penguin!

       Week 4   I need a replacement immune system.  The one that I have is FIRED!  I have been sick for almost a month now, which is just ridiculous.  It started off as a common cold.  But every time I feel like I'm getting better, I end up developing an entirely new (and worse) set of symptoms. Maybe it's a cold, or maybe it's the flu, or maybe it's a sinus infection.  Since I'm Asian, it is most likely the panda-flu and this is just the beginning of a new epidemic. I wouldn't be surprised.  I'm delirious now and must get some rest.  Laughter another time. Sympathy now. Send me soup.  Send me flowers.  Send me money. These things will help me get better.    WARNING: Not for the feint of heart   This is the " urlLink Smack the Pengu " game that will give you nightmares.   Mai  currently holds the record at  1103.8  You are a very disturbed girl.  Get some help.  You would have to be a sick, sadistic horror of a human being to enjoy this game. Congratulations to Becki who has a high of 955.  Haha. Now, if this game was modified to be "Smack Clay"...    I love my Rolo. The first, the last, and every piece between.   urlLink

       Top Ten Things that I Find Repulsive in Men*:  [Not in any particular order.  They're ALL gross!]  1.   Long Nails  - There is no need for this. 2.   Hips  - This feature is too "womanly" for my taste. (Also, narrow shoulders. Argh) 3.   Pubey Facial Hair  - If you can't grow proper facial hair, don't try. 4.   Lisps  - Thorry, jutht too hard to take anything you thay theriothly. 5.   Funky Odor  - Some people smell so bad they make my eyes water.  *barf* 6.   Spidery Pit Hair  - Haha.  You might as well shave it off! 7.   British Teeth  - Busted teeth are not attractive.  BRUSH YOUR TEETH! 8.   Visible Nose/Ear hairs ** - Keep 'em trimmed.  No one wants to play in your enchanted forest. 9.  Mullet   - What possesses a person to get this "style" is beyond me. 10.   Clay Aiken  - Enough said***.  *  Actually, most of this stuff is just criminal in general.  So, trim those nose hairs, ladies! **  I noticed that I have a lot of hair-related stuff.  Weird. *** Read previous Blogs for detailed Clay-related hate propaganda.   PETA-endorsed site of the day:   I never would have believed that smacking a penguin around could be so addictive.  urlLink http://www.meph.eu.org/  High Score to beat:   593.5   - Robinson.

       It Don't Matter If You're Yellow or White :  When I was shopping at the mall today (with my mom, cause I'm a poor loser), I saw what appeared to be three middle-aged women (also shopping).  However, it turns out that two of them were not middle-aged but mid-teenaged:  a mother and two daughters .  The daughters were  monstrous .  They looked decrepit.  They were wearing clothes that were way too tight, their blush was streaky and I could see their foundation lines.  All signs pointed towards a mid-life crisis.  However, while I was in the dressing room, I overheard them talking to the sales clerk about school; the 11th grade to be exact.  I could not believe my ears. Those old hags were actually pimply teenagers.  Now I realize that age-fluidity* is not limited to Asians.  So, I apologize to all you whiteys whom I have been discriminating against for years for not knowing how to differentiate Asian-chronology*.   I have learned that even  I  can be fooled on occasion.  *  Not actual terms (That's right, I went there).   First Day of Spring:   Snow fell in Orillia.  I had to shovel.  (Actually, that is a lie.  I merely  thought  about shovelling, but it's the thought that counts).   For the Ladies:  Sit or Squat?   It has been brought to my attention, that man is not the only gender that makes a mess of the toilet bowl. So, let us come to a consensus.  Sit.  Or if you must squat, then do not spill.  That is just wrong.  And should you spill.  Clean.  Or Clay will haunt your dreams. It's just not worth it. Just imagine, Creepy Clay who will sing to you about his creepy loneliness and his creepy peeper tendencies. Ewwwwwww.  * shudder*

       Nutz 101:   The squirrels at U of T are balding.  I think it's because they have some sort of secret squirrel school on campus.  It would explain the balding (from stress) and also our tuition hikes (we have to pay for their education since they don't have valid currency - acorns, accepted no where).   "I Have Nothing to Wear!!!" - Seriously:   I was going through my closet this morning trying find an ensemble appropriate for the work place.  After sorting through everything I came to several conclusions:  1.  I have entirely too many plain blue t-shirts  2.  Need to retire clothes that I bought in elementary school (that makes them almost 10 years old?!)  3.  Need more socks - what happened to all of my fun socks?  Now they're all plain black - how horribly boring  4.  Need to throw away anything that has holes in it (same goes for clothes with "mystery" stains - the ones that never wash out)  5.  If I throw away everything with holes and stains, I literally won't have anything to wear.   Donations will be accepted c/o Carol's a Poor Loser Foundation   Please let it be noted that the pants I am currently wearing are "hemmed" with staples.

      It has taken me over a week to adjust to my new schedule.  So, my blog has suffered.  But no longer!!  I can blog and work and study and sleep...  I think something is missing from that list... oh, right, my life. Friends, *sniff*, where have you gone?  Family... yeah, whatever.  I miss my dog though!   I Am My Own Worst Enemy:   I arrived at work early.  For those who know me, they know that this is a rare occurrence indeed.  But it's true~  Carol was early . Naturally, no one was at the office to witness this amazing feat.  I decided to make use of my "buffer" time by getting some water for the kettle (to make some tea). Unfortunately, when I opened up in the morning, I forgot to turn off the auto-lock behind me.  So, when I came back to the office with my kettle full of water, I was locked out.  It took nearly 20 minutes and 3 security personnel to let me back into the office.  In the meantime, I could hear the phone ringing through the door.  By all appearances, it seemed that I was late for work.  I arrive 10 minutes early only to start work 10 minutes late. Now isn't   that   ironic?   Note:  I set an ultimate Carol-late-record when I arrived at an event 4 hours late.  When one aims for 6:30pm and arrives at 10:30pm for no particular reason, that is truly sad.  Seriously, I was moving as fast as I could - I conclude, that it is my destiny to be late for things and all the "being on time" set off the balance of my life and I had to make it up somehow.

       Work Hard, Play Hard.   The office is empty.  I'm the only one here.  I have no assigned projects at this time. Singing along with Ol' Blue Eyes (Frank). Checking my emails.  Surfin' the 'net.  Life isn't so bad , I think.  Then I remember, school.  Why am I at U of T?  Why do the professors enjoy punishing us? Finals are fast around the corner and I have my work cut out for me.  So, as I go over my macro econ. lecture notes I am thinking:    Perhaps, getting paid   (not much)   for "working"   (aka.  being an office fixture while "studying")  -  isn't such a bad thing.  After all, it could be worse.  I could still be in retail .  Sorry, Indigo!   Aside:  When the prof is writing all those numbers and letters down, does anyone follow the calculations? -- I find that I cannot even scrawl her formulas and deductions down fast enough, let alone process the information in the meantime.  Perhaps, I should have gone to York instead.  Haha...  death first !  Sorry, York.  I'm kidding, I'm not really sorry.  That's right, I went there.  Mwa ha ha!

       Rail Rage:   Miserable commute this morning.  It started with people blocking the escalator. "Walk left, Stand right", there are  signs  people!!! It makes me want to push them down... Or up, depending on which way the machine is moving.  I was going down - so it would have been fun to watch the domino effect.  Delays on the escalator were followed by some idiot blocking the "entrance". If you don't have your metropass or token out, then   step aside, Jack  .  Arrive prepared.  What the hell were you doing while you were standing on the left-side of the escalator anyways?  Picking your nose?    Rush hour, crammed, stinky, hot subway car.   If that's not bad enough, you have inconsiderate people who still act like they have all the room in the world. There was a girl leaning up against the pole.  Who does she think she is?  Other people also need use of the pole - ie. To hold on for dear life when the crazy amateur driver slams the brakes at every stop sending passengers flying. Damn girl, I wanted to  smash her little head against the pole .  Seriously.  I really saw red when her giant backpack kept knocking into me.   Take it off!   She was so rude.  Even now, I would feel good if I had the opportunity to smash her face. Violent, yes.  Disturbing, yes.  Satisfying, YES!  And then, as if that wasn't enough, when I was trying to get off the subway at my stop, people were blocking the doorway. Not only were there people blocking the entrance of the doorway (you won't lose your spot, just step out for a moment and let people off!) but there were also people rushing the doors to get on. Haven't they learned the rules yet?  Let people  off  first,  then  get on!   So to all you TTC users:  1.  Walk left, stand right [Also, if you are walking left, don't take a "break" from walking when you reach the end - tempting as that is, you just end up causing a jam behind you, so move it or I busta your face!] 2.  Have your metropass/token/money ready - or else move aside! 3.  Remove any giant bags from your body before you enter the subway (or bus). 4.  Do not rush the doors when people are trying to get out (rushing the door at other times is perfectly acceptable.) 5.  If you're standing by the doors, move out of the way when people need to exit. 6.  Do not monopolize any of the poles.  There are little people (such as ME!) who cannot reach the top rail and need to use anything we can access. 7.  Also, do not bring stinky foods, or your stinky body into these crammed spaces.  Albeit, some people get stinky after working all day and don't have showering facilities at their workplace - but other than those few, NO B.O.  Makes me want to puke.   Of course none of my friends are like the aforementioned people because, like me, they are all fabulous!  Right?!

       Pigeons.   Where did they come from?  How did they end up in our city?  Setting up home on the ledges of our lecture buildings?  Sherman provided the answer:   Once there was a beautiful dove who lived in the country.  She decided to seek fortune and fame in the big city.  So, she flew to Toronto to make a home ... and married a rat, and had a litter of rats-with-wings (aka. pigeons).  And the rest, as they say, is history.   Now, these pigeons terrorize me wherever I step.  They never seem to move out of my way, those obstinate creatures.  They bob their heads in a very creepy manner.  And their "coo"-ing is absolutely repulsive.  Although I have many pigeon stories, one of the most disgusting things I have seen them do is devour street meat.  Made me think twice about what was in my hot dog. And really, when you're eating a hot dog, you shouldn't think about what is in it, if you want to enjoy it.

       So THAT's What I Was Missing All These Years...   Today, I have discovered the pleasure of peanut butter.  Who knew that something that looked like poo could taste to good?   All my life I have avoided peanut butter.  Never liked the way it stuck to the roof of my mouth.  Also, my brother loved it.  In my youth, I had a brief affair with PB after watching Meet Joe Black.  Proof that Brad Pitt can convice women to do anything! But since then, I haven't touched the stuff.  Until today.  I spread some PB on some soda crackers and  now  for no particular reason I'm an instant convert.  [It is possible, however, that I just associate PB with Brad Pitt - Both are DELICIOUS!]   Perhaps it is true that your body changes its chemistry every 7 years.  After all, I can eat bacon again and now I like PB.  Or else, perhaps I am turning into my brother.

       Tuna Surprise:   As a snack today, I grabbed an  Ocean's Albacore Tuna SnacKit . It was the coolest thing.  "White tuna & mayonnaise, ready to eat with crackers, spoon & napkin", who could resist testing it out?  As I was eating it, I had the sensation that I was eating Ritz-wannabe crackers and some kind of cat food (specifically, Fancy Feast, the can has the same shape and size - the only thing that is missing is a picture of a frisky feline). I don't think I'm gonna be eating tuna again anytime soon.  And if I do, then it will be dolphin friendly tuna.  [Scandal:   Dolphin's off the coast of Scotland are murdering porpoises!  They toss them in the air, beat their bodies and bite them to death.  Poor porpoises, they're so tiny and don't stand a chance.  Guess Flipper isn't so one-dimensional after all!  ]  I think I'm just going to have start bringing my own salad to work.

       Who am I?   I am 50% Charlotte, 40% Miranda and 10% Carrie.  urlLink How about you?   There will come a day when I will be able to drop a grand on a pair of shoes! That day  will  come!!! And when it does, I'd like to think that I will be a big person and use the money somewhere more practical or humanitarian - but come on, I  am  10% Carrie after all. I can't fight that.

       Politiks:  Canadians to Bush:  We hope you lose, eh.   I'm cheering for Kerry (actually, I would prefer Gore or a Clinton but I guess I'm going to have to wait). Which presidential candidate do you support?!  urlLink Take a quiz and find out who your match is!    U of T Makes Me Cry On the Inside:   It's time for finals and it's the same story again.  I have a great plan; I know exactly what and when I should study for each subject.  I have a meticulously organized study schedule - that I fail to follow.  And now it's 2 days before my exam and I have covered less than 2% of the course material.  Why, oh why, did I do this to myself - again?!! Every year I tell myself it won't be like last year.  This time I'll stick to my study schedule... *sob*... Who am I trying to fool, anyways?  My body is too old to pull all-nighters anymore.  No worries though, starting in September I won't procrastinate!  I learned my lesson  this  time!    urlLink FYI:  My children, unlike yours, will be perfect .

       Everyone Do the Titty-Tot!   If you go out for a night in Toronto, you are guaranteed to witness the various dancing rituals of the male urban specimens. You may witness the head-bobber, the lip-biter, the fist-pumper or the b-boy-wannabe.  However, if you're lucky you will witness the rare dance of the Titty-Tot.  It takes place when stopped at a red-light.  In an adjacent cab, the QT will roll down his window and reveal his nipple!  Then he will proceed to rub it aggressively causing much ruckasing and laughter. At the next red-light, he will reveal his tail-feathers.  However, rather than exposing them to his chosen females, he will mistakenly show his tail to a neighbouring cab - tragically filled with other males.  This will lead to conflict and chaos between the two cabs.  It is at this time, that you make your escape into the quiet of the night and put your binoculars away for another day, another dance and another man-watching fiesta.

       You're Turning 23 and You're Not Married Yet?!   Apparently, I'm going to be a spinster with nothing to keep me company in my old age except my degrees, my menagerie and my free-loading brother.  I remember my cousin getting harassed to get married... It was terrible. But "the Family" didn't bothered her until she was almost 30.  So, naturally, I assumed I would be "safe" for at least 5 or 6 more years. It seems, however, that with no one left to harass, I have unexpectedly been tossed into the marriage-arena and the fact that I am a student is not a valid defense.  Sorry, Family;  I'm loving my freedom - No ball and chain for me! No grandkids anytime in the near future either;  That's why I brought home Mia (the 3lb dog).  Note:   The concept of my parents trying to "set me up" is one of the creepiest things I can think of.  Almost as creepy as the time they asked me if I wanted another brother or sister  *gag*  To my Conservative Friend:  Don't get me a book.  Get me a mail-order-husband.  Preferably old, grey and white.

       Got Laide!  Then Danced Circles at a Square Party!   For my birthday, I took some friends to a  urlLink restaurant , and I, as per usual, was LATE!  Not a very good way to begin a new year of life.  The service was non-existent but luckily there was fetish porn playing on the screen to distract us(is that legal?).  The drinks were delicious!  And the company was even better!  After Laide, I went to a  urlLink club  and managed to lose one of my friends.  Where did she go?  Nobody knows.  Just between you and me, I think I know  exactly  where she went. *wink*  All in all, I had a blast!  Big thanks to everyone who came out!  I hope y'all had as much fun as I did!  Note:   I am making an honest effort to be on time for things because I know people hate waiting.  I know this because, ironically, I hate waiting. Perhaps, that is why I am always late?  My inner-clock and my subconscious are scheming together to prevent me from suffering the agony of waiting.

       Argh!  Lost Everything!   So much for new and improved. I chose a new blog template (as you may have noticed) and I lost all the old comments! :(  That makes me sad.  I can't even figure out how to change it so that people can add comments to "old" blog entries.  I hate computers!  I hate them so much!  Will continue to blog after I get over my loss.  [And after I finish all my mini-projects at work... where blogging during office hours is frowned upon!]

       Okay, I like you Red, but I don't like what you're doing to my life...   Those who know me, know I'm a die-hard Liberal (by default because every other party horrifies me). Now, the Federal elections are creeping upon us.  Jean Creepien ruined the Federal Liberals.  That old hack should have stepped down with some amount of dignity.  I'd like to pie him and join the foreign nations in pointing my finger and laughing at Canadian "security".  But alas, Paul Martin is such a cutie old man.  He waddles and looks like he should have a cane.  Maybe it would make him a little more distinguished. He is very different from his father (Paul Martin Sr. who was all about the socialism - heck, he practically invented it). But by association, I think that PM Martin must have social values at the heart of all his number crunching Finance Minister days.  Now, McGuinty and the Provincial Liberals... ARGH! I was all good and fine with them.  Even wondered why so many people were harping over the recent tax increase (for health care); Wondering, that is, until I received my paycheck yesterday.  JEBUS!  I couldn't believe the packet I took.  Boy, was I cheesed off.  Of course, it would have been nice if my boss would have absorbed the new tax increase within the company (Big Fat Greek Chance of that happening...) Good thing he's going to give me a raise (my probationary 3 months is up, and I didn't get fired!  Congratulations, Carol~).  So, now my hope is that my after-tax paycheck is going to be the same as it was when I first started!  Isn't that ridiculous?  Provincial Liberals... You're ruining the Federal elections and I'd really like to kick someone. But I suppose if I see real changes in the Health Care system - and soon - then I'll know my $50/w's extra in taxes is being used efficiently. If, on the Ethernets, I see the Provincial Liberals hosting some sort of grand luncheon at my tax-expense, McGuinty can expect me to bring dessert.

       Master Designer Kim:   It has been an exciting couple of days at the office.  I have mostly lounged while looking at swatches of paint colours and wall paper materials.  I have chosen a "light mocha" paint (which has taken on peachy/pink-undertones against the cran-grape carpeting and perfectly complements existing artwork). The wallpaper has gold and copper and is total quality.  Yep, it has been a tough couple of days at the office for me. Ordering the Boss around (pertaining to the hanging of the artwork - "too high, too far to the left,...") while standing around and supervising as furniture is being relocated.  I'd say that I put in a couple solid days of productive work.   Note:  The Boss has applied to the CCRA to get payroll taxes taken off of my pay because I am still a student.  We'll see how this goes.  Perhaps I will get back to my "original" pay at some point.    Also, The Boss has requested Leafs tickets (box) from   urlLink Domi   for a homegame game in the next season - pour moi! [Smoozing with  urlLink Mogilny  and Domi is totally lost on this person - he does not give a fig for sports!  Insane!]   We'll see if these things happen, but if they do, wouldn't it be nice? :) Yes, it would be very nice.

       The Tale of the Possessed Elevator:   Got on elevator on 1st floor. It is just me. Hold elevator door. Woman gets on. Now there are two. I push 4. She delays in pressing 3. Elevator passes 3rd floor. Small laugh together. Must have pushed button too late. Elevator passes the 4th floor, And the 5th. On floor 6, it stops. Doors don't open. "Open doors" button. Nothing. panic sets in. Elevator starts to move. 5th floor. People get on. Now there are four. Push 1. Go to 1st floor. Doors do not open. Elevator moves to 3rd floor. Doors open. Now there are three. 4th floor, 5th floor, 6th floor, Doors do not open. 5th floor, Doors open. I escape. Wait for next elevator. Same elevator arrives. It is empty. I enter. I press 4. 4th floor. Doors open. I survive! Wings still hot! All is good.   Note:  Those wondering why I didn't just take the stairs, the doors onto the office floors are locked from the stairwells (I don't understand that logic) and thus, the only option is to take the elevator, cross your fingers and hope that it isn't the haunted one.

       Sweet Liberating Dreams:    Time to vote, Canada!  I fell asleep watching the debate (in English).  To my dismay, Mr. Paul Martin did not razzle or dazzle me. This was his time to get fence-sitters to side with the "right" party instead of the "right-wing" party. It stressed me out so badly that I actually had a Debate Dream: [Now there's a U of T student for ya!  Even our  dreams  are nerdy!]   I was PM Martin's "Water Girl".   I was bringing Martin a glass of water and the debate was still going on:  Layton was telling Harper to send the "Superstar USA" winner to Iraq as a WMD.  [Okay, not exactly post-secondary education standard dream material, but she had just won the night before I had this dream.]  I just remember thinking:  Mr. Martin!  You have to get in a ZINGER!   Zinger?  Zing Zing! Zap...  Who uses the word "zinger"?  Now I do.  Anyways, in neither the televised debate nor my REM debate did the PM Martin get in ANY zingers.  It was tragic (and stressful).  But thank the goddesses, the Liberals are IN! Hopefully they'll be balanced by both the NDP and the Conservatives and I hope we don't go back to the polls any time soon.  [I won't even mention the  traitorous BQs ... Okay, I will:  Anyone that voted for them should be deported immediately to somewhere in Europe - Frankly, I don't care  where  in Europe but I think that the EU deserves to deal with them - just for being surrender monkeys (not to mention that they probably eat cheese!)]  In the meantime  HAPPY BIRTHDAY CANADA!   We're still RED!

       Boss, Where Art Thou?   In the office, trying to work on a client's file.  By "work", I mean checking my emails,  urlLink reading articles online , and solving a crossword puzzle.  I had a bowl of oatmeal (lots of sugar) and now I have a hankering for some coffee.  I feel like  urlLink Peter , sans Tetris. Now, if I had Tetris on my computer, this would be a hellova place!  "M'kay?"

       The Camping and The Beaching: Beauties and the Beast   Went to Wasaga Beach for the holiday weekend. Oh man, did I ever need it.  It was fabulous to be away from family and work and family and school and, did I mention, family?  I was worried about bugs at the "campsite" (aka parking lot w/ tents) but there very few "flying bugs" and even less "going bugs". With the exception of an attack by an unidentified bug on  Cookie , the insect war was rather tame.  Big thanks goes out to  Carcar  and  Smooth Rols  who helped me wash my laundry (and my hair).  The weather was beautiful and so were the people. It was horrifying.  A good reminder of why I  don't  own a bathing suit and why I  should  go to the gym.  From fatter to fitter in 120 days! So, starting  next  week... I swear! And then I'll consider the possibility of joining my favourite "freakin' weirdo" sunbathing in something other than baggy shorts and t-shirts.

       Why It So Dark In Here?    I have just scared myself awake for the next week.   After much hesitation, I finally bit the bullet and calculated my outstanding debts, payables and upcoming payables.&nbsp; My stomach is still somewhere in the throat region (which explains why I am having trouble swallowing right now).         Where has all my money gone?   I know I've been working full-time since March.   Doesn't that mean that I should be out of debt?&nbsp; Possibly, saving money?  Nurturing a nest egg?   As&nbsp;I find myself buried deep, deep, deep in the dark, dank, dirt.  I ask myself this:&nbsp;    What manner of hole is this?

       Friday Nights with a 23-year-old Spinster in the Making:   Another exciting night in the life of one Salted Lemon.  Drank 1 Caesar. Extra spicy. Ate enough dinner for 2 adults. Made enough dinner for 6. Took an hour to recover from aforementioned dinner. Ate Godiva truffles. Worked on a puzzle while watching an Antonio Banderis movie on TV. Passed out before 12:30am.  *pat pat How old my body has grown in these few short months. I blame work entirely! *sob

       Olympic Bandwagon: You'll wish YOU were the wagon!   I have officially hopped on board. Until today, I had been immune to the hype of the Summer Olympics. It's not particularly interesting; people running around a track and/or throwing objects and/or jumping about like mad men.  And then I remembered what I had forgotten: Olympic size pools and tiny speedos. Oh my!   urlLink Alexandre . He's 19 now. No longer criminal - but close. And he's phenomenal. *le sigh Photos of him diving... or standing... or doing  ABS olutely nothing... are plastered everywhere - So, I know what sporting event I'll be watching this year! Do you?!  FYI:  It is currently 33C and sunny in Athens.
