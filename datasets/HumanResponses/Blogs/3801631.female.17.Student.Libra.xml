        Well this is my first entry as a blogger. Where to start...   Mood: Black tinged with excitement. Music: Seether ft Amy Lee - Broken. (on repeat) Hair: Tied back in a ponytail. Make-up: None. Too early. Weather: It's England. Therefore rain.   *~RANT OF THE DAY~* Oh yeah. My friend is such an irritating bitch. Well, not my friend any more. All because I'm now in a serious relationship with her ex boyfriend....Mardy cow. He hasn't wanted her for almost 3 years! YES, 3 years they have been broken up for and she still can't let go! I think she needs to grow up and go see a shrink or something, because she is not wired up right!   No matter what she does or says, she is not going to split me and David up and the quicker she realises that the better. Can't tell her tho. Pretty pathetic for a 21 year old. Yes, I am 17, yes David is 24. But what's age when love strikes? NOTHING.  Besides. None of her business. BITCH. I wonder if her car door would like to see my car keys? Hmm. Now theres a thought.  *~THE GOOD STUFF~*  David and I are going out for a meal tonight. Going to buy him the new Keane album later. He has the prettiest bright blue eyes...*dreaming* Ahem. And bloody   brilliant  in bed...And the mini...And anywhere else...   MUCH better than my ex. But lets not get me started on that wanker either.  Going for a scan today at 3:50...Reality might sink in then that I'm actually having baby. I didn't do it on purpose, I had big plans for myself. Wanted to go to University next year. I can hear it now, fluttering out of the window...OOOH, that quote was from Hercules...(excuse me, I have a passion for anything Disney. Except Snow White. HATE that film.)  MUST BUY: New underwear. New top. Keane Album. Scan photo.  YAY. I get to be with David all night tonight. YAY.

       Mood: Tired.  Music: Faith Hill - There You'll Be Album (on repeat) Hair: Tied back in a ponytail. Just dyed it purpley/black. Make-up: None. Too early. Weather: Heavy rain.     *~RANDOM THOUGHTS~* Relationships are funny things. Different people do things differently. Take, for example, my father. Him and his girlfriend, Mary, moved in together after only a month. She told me only this morning that she still can't believe how fast she fell for my dad.  I never understood it. My relationship at the time was...Well, looking back on it, we both wanted completely different things. I didn't get pregnant on purpose - I had my whole life planned. Finish my A-Levels, go to Uni to study Eng Lit and Creative Writing. And I definately didn't and don't want that asshole around me for the rest of my life. Which he won't be. He can take me to court if he wants access.   Until I met David. We've been together a month, and if he asked me to run away with him and get married, I would do it. If he asked me to move in with him today, I would do it. We've spoken about both of these things, and when I find a house/flat to rent, (my Unc's been considering renting me his house) David will be moving in with me.    *~RANT OF THE DAY~* Emily again. She wanted to talk to me to sort things out. Sorry hunni, the only thing we need to sort out is whether or not you can accept that David and I are together or not. And you can't. Told her I am not intrested in anything that she has to say. Then she started getting petty saying she wanted her mini discs back and that I owe her money. Yeah, right. She's got her mini discs and she will be satisfied with that.   I think she realises just what a good friend she has lost, because once you are in my close circle of friends, it is very rare that you drop out of it. I'm loyal, will defend you to the death, and never be 2 faced, or lie, or cheat, or steal...  MUST DO: Go in bath. Wash hair. Make dinner.
