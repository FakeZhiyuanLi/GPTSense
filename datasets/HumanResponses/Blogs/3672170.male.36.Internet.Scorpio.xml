      Your promises cause pain, I can't stand the pain, you send me dancing in the rain, yet your love I can't gain, always running with a chain, your treatment is insane, in pain I rarely complain, do I only serve to entertain, always drinking champagne, I must get away from the pain, as this relationship was all in vain.  The End.

      Heaven is a whisper away, don't wait till the final day, hear all that Jesus has to say, He is the only way.  The End.

      It wasn't long ago, when we first met, how I'll never forget, your looks stirred passion, always the look of fashion.

      No matter what you say, you are not here to stay. We will be going away, as it is His way. Life is not always so gay, don't like your life decay, accept His way.  The End.

      I see the pain in your eyes, your touch makes me cry. I wish I could heal you with my touch, my love for you grows so much. Out time together grows shorter every day, I'm afraid I'll not know what to say. My love for you will never stray, our love will carry us far, far away.  The End.

      I can't believe I have been out drinking all day, now I have to figure out what to say. Should I start with "it started this way", no, I used that last time. Maybe I should explain it in a rhyme, no, that's not worth a dime. Who am I kidding she won't let me in anyway, So I'll go back to the bar and drink the rest of my pay!  The End.

      The door is locked, curtains are drawn, lights are out, no one will see, no one will know, it's just you and me, get ready for the show, but first take it slow, for this could only be a moment.  The End.

      As I search for answers in my mind, I realize I am always left behind. Many doors close leaving me alone, even leaving me without a phone. There is no time to feel sorrow, I can only hope for a better tomorrow.  The End.

      There are many rules in life, they cause us great strife. Are rules a necessary part of life, I guess so just ask my wife!  The End.

      Why Lord, oh why, we sit and only ask why. We should know the answers don't just fall from the sky. Just because the sky is blue, should we be too? No we don't know it all, so always have faith before you make that call.  The End.

      My how the moon shines brightly tonight, it lights up a dark room, tossing about a mysterious glow, silent fingers of light seem to creep across the room, but there is one object that catches my eye, her lower leg quietly rests along side the sheet, like a caressing touch the moonlight rolls up, towards her inner thigh, with a slow sigh and exhale the sheet raises, quickly the moon light races towards her lower back, exposing the gentle curves of her petite frame, within a blink the clouds cover the light, and now it is time to say good night.  The End.

      Watching rainfall reminds me of tears,  sometimes falling gently, sometimes falling hard, tears and rain fall for many reasons, rain can signal a change of seasons, a little rain falls in everyone's life, tears show emotions in time of strife, like rain that always finds away, let the tears fall where they may,  both signaling everything will be ok.  The End.

      It is just another day, one that resembles yesterday. I keep waiting for a change, but the waiting makes me feel strange. Maybe the window above this cage, will disengage. Could this be the day I fly away, or should I just stay? This feeling is turning to fear, maybe I don't want to go up into the atmosphere. I could just persevere, for tomorrow will be just another day anyway.  The End.

      It is that time of year again, where all can pretend, to be who we desire, not who we are, as mystery fills the air, everyone's let down their hair, some go for scare, looking like a nightmare, others just weren't sure what to wear, and did little to prepare, they surely aren't millionaires, but no matter the outer wear, their lives are still in despair, as the day ends and the return to solitaire.  The End.
