      Wax, like honey, rich and emollient -warm and golden, spreads so thin.  So, I was waxing my friend the other day; this time she wanted me to clean the whole thing up.  I was speecheless as she suddenly stood naked before me; I felt priveledged that she would show me her body in that way.  I could not help but notice how beautiful she was, and sexual, too.  Somehow, I felt erotic, staring like it was ok to but looking like a virgin does at the sight of her lover's body for the very first time.  I was overcome but I took to my task like a worker bee and strip by strip I ripped her hair away; I could see her body tremble, the way she bit her lip -to hide the pain.  As I went lower, I noticed something shiny and tried to ignore it (I thought it was woman juice) so as not to embarass her.  I wasn't sure whether I would have liked to smile or cringe.  Eventually, the gleamingness become unavoidable, and, I finally realized what it was.  Turns out my friend has a clit-ring.

      The other day my friend and I were talking about our crotches (a different friend this time).  I think we started talking about our scents.  That was when she told me that she sniffs she panties regularly, in order to insure that her scent is pleasant.  I think she thought that was, like, some huge revealation and asked me not to mention it to anyone else we know.  The truth is that I only expected that was the natural thing to do.  Everyone smells themselves.  And, most, probably like the way they smell; it's just nature.  I know I like the way I smell -like warm butter, all hot and juicy; melted nectar, honey, fresh dew of the flower -petals dripping...the ground below it soaking.  The scent is like that of fresh sex.  Now, another friend told me that she tastes herself during self-inspections; good for her.  I just save that for the guys.

      Today my friend and I decided to compare our vaginas and discovered that we look complete different from one another; somewhere I heard that there are three main versions of the human vagina.  Although we share many of the same physical characteristics, such as, our skin and hair color, my friend and I are complete opposites when it comes to the between our legs part.  For instance, her lips fold outward where as mine fold inward.  Now, we both have full lips but my clitoris is placed higher up than hers.  So, with hers, I guess the lucky man could slurp up her juices and kiss her button all at once.  Where as with mine, he could keep his lips somewhat dry; sounds crazy, right?  But these are things that you may not think of before taking the dive -or do you, gentlemen?  Well, I guess you'll just have to decide whether or not your a juicer.  Now, thats not to say that you could be a juicer and not be with me; you'll just have to dig deeper.  Well, thats really what its all about, when it comes down to it, isn't it -just how deep your willing to go.  And, for me, you better go deep.

      Sexpionage is the result of the combination of the words sex and espionage, and, I've decided that it means sexual espionage.  Now that I've defined that, I can get on with the rest.  So, I have really great lips; they're big and beautiful.  I just discovered the meaning of DSL.  Any other little secret terms that I should know about? As I stated before in my profile, I may be a little obsession with sex -or, have an insatiable appetite for it, especially lately.  That is why I have created this blog.  You See, for the past couple of weeks or so, I've been driving my friends nuts talking about sex.  I just can't stop thinking about it -everywhere I go, everything I do -something always reminds me of it.  I don't see it as a problem, though.  I mean, I'm really kind of enjoying it; I feel alive and I love reeking of sex.  Too bad no one has found a way to send scents over the internet because I'm telling you, I think my pheromones have a mind of their own.  I think they are capable of meeting up with hot men around the block; its like I just know when someone good walks in the room before I can even see them.  My pulse quickens, I start to feel warm, dizzy -almost high, and then, our eyes meet up and its like my pheromones take over.  Suddenly, I feel completely content, knowing that the ball is in my court.  I guess that's what happens when you get a taste of the real thing.  I get chills down my spine and permasmile every time I think about it. This is what I live for...that rush, that adrenaline, and a whole lot more:)

      Last night my bestfriend stayed the night with me.  We slept in the same bed as always but apparently she didn't sleep very well.  This morning I was asked if I had another one of "those dreams?"  After thinking about it for a second I realised that, in fact, I had and was able to recall having three seperate encounters during my dreams. She said, "well, they must have been pretty good anyway," and proceeded to tell me that I did a lot of tossing in turning in my sleep.  "At first, I just thought that you were having a bad dream but then you starting making these kissing sounds. I didn't know if maybe I should leave you alone for a while but I thought it was kind of funny and stayed,"she said.  But, apparently, my bestfriend wasn't finished -"oh, and the best part was -and this is so funny...you were rocking back and forth and the whole bed starting shaking.  Its like, now I know what your like in bed even though I never expected to find out -and I'm thinking, she even gets to have it in her sleep."

      So, lately I've been having lots of dreams about sex.  I don't know why; it's not like I go to sleep thinking about it -at least, not every night.  But, somehow, I've managed to dream up a new man and have ended up in bed with him by the end of each dream, consecutively -for about the past two months.  I remember waking up from my first sex dream; I felt warm, relaxed and fulfilled.  That man, a figment of my imagination, had far more to offer me than my relationship at the time did.  And, it was that day that the three year long commitment ended; it was the first day among many that has provided me with an open door to explore my sexual needs (cravings and curiosties).  Little by little, it's coming back to me; the fun I had with boys, the way they used to line up for me, the way they are going to -now that I'm back to being...just me.
