      Man. What a crazy life it's been. I think I quite possibly could be the most self-centered person ever. And I don't mean to be. I should be happy for other people. Instead, I tend to focus on what my life is lacking, and how much of a loser I am because I'm lacking these "oh-so-important" things. It sucks being single, watching all of your friends fall in and out of love over and over again, while you're sitting on the sidelines just wishing you could be a part of the team. It's not that I don't have admirers, because I do have a few, but I don't feel the same way about them. I'm beginning to think there's something wrong with me. Have you ever woken up and realized that life is nothing like you'd hoped it would be? That you'll never be perfect, and all of this is just a stupid game? I've felt that way every morning for the past two months. I don't know what's happening to me. Sometimes I wish I wouldn't wake up. I know it sounds crazy. Don't get me wrong, I'm not going to kill myself, but sometimes I wish I didn't have to live. I hate life. I hate who I've become. If you're reading this, don't judge me. You've never been there.

      Wow.  Last night was so much fun.  Helen, Candi, Becky, Stephanie, Buddy, and I went to Common Grounds to eat.  Then we went to Breaker's, where we met up with Krissy, Matt, Randi, and Grant.  Then Helen's friend Don showed up, and Alison and Brent finally got there.  Some of Jared's friends were there, but no Jared.  We played pool, drank, and I called Jeff about fifteen million times to find out when he was showing up.  I knew Ryan was working, so I knew he wouldn't be able to get there until later.  He called @ 9:45 to get directions.  Everyone told me I gave really bad directions.  They made sense to me.  Anyway.  Ryan showed up, and it was like everyone else had left.  I can not believe I am this pathetic.  I am head over heels in love with the boy, and we're friends.  I can't ever tell him, because if he doesn't feel the same way, I wouldn't want our friendship to be weird.  Then, all of the old married people decided it was time to call it a night around 11:30.  Ryan and I were waiting in the parking lot, for Becky to come back from getting her car.  She and I were going to continue to celebrate, but Ryan couldn't go to the places we were headed because he's only 20.  So, I hugged him goodbye, and we made plans for another racquetball game.  You know, he needs to say something about how fabulous I look.  I've lost 40 pounds in the past 8 months, and not a word said about it.  Everyone else constantly tells me how great I look, but Ryan hasn't said a damn thing.  Why is that?  Anyway.  Enough for now.

      Okay, I have to get into the shower, seriously, but Ryan just called.  I'm so excited.  He was double checking the time and place.  How cute is he, and how much of a loser am I for thinking that something would ever happen between us???

      Craziness.  That's all I have to say about it.  I'm tired, hungry, and tired.  Oh wait, I said that one already.  Got a lot to do tomorrow.  Work sucked today.  My mom called just to hear me answer the phone, when I say "Dept. 46, this is Jessica, how can I help you?", then she said "I'm going to have to call each day just to hear you say it, because I won't get to hear it ever again."  Which caused tears to flow uncontrollably.  Each day gets harder, and I'm still getting fatter.  And, there's a box of thin mint cookies downstairs that I know is calling for me.  I must resist.  Yeah, okay.  Me resisting chocolate would be like Michael Jackson resisting plastic surgery.  Not likely.  I think I may have found a decent candidate for the "piece of ass".  We'll see how that works out.  So, lots going on, and we know I need my beauty sleep for tomorrow, so................

      So, today was another really good day.  Officially only 21 days until I'm sleeping in a bunk somewhere in South Carolina.  Kinda scary.  There's so much that I'm looking forward to, but so much that I'm going to miss at the same time.  I'll miss my family.  I don't think I've been further than an hour drive away from them my whole life (not counting vacations, because you know you're coming home).  I'll miss my sister.  We've really become close over the last year or so.  I'll miss harassing her boyfriends.  I'll miss four-wheelin' on the back property w/ Dad, and the talks on the porch swing w/ Mom.  I still haven't written my letter to Justin.  Not sure what I'm going to say, but I think a letter is the best way to do it.  I haven't even made a dent in my debt, which I was striving to get taken care of before I leave.  I'm moving all of my stuff into a storage unit this weekend.  That's kinda scary, too.  Not knowing when I'll actually have a "home" again.  I'm looking forward to the opportunities that I'll have w/ the Army.  I'm also looking forward to proving to everyone else what I've known my whole life.  That I am an All Around Badass!  I'll miss watching the English Premier League, and keeping up with the Bundesliga.  I won't miss the idiots, though I know I'll meet more than my fair share in there.  But, they'll be new and different idiots.  I'm looking forward to that.  More people to mentally torture.  I'm going to miss Alison, Helen, Becky, Stephanie, Opal, Vanessa, Janie, Mike, Allen, and Jim.  And all of the countless others that I see on a day-to-day basis.  Who will laugh at my crazy idiocies?  Certainly not my commanding officer.  I doubt he'll find it funny that I can't walk in a straight line, or that sometimes, for no reason at all, I trip and fall.  I think I'm stuck in that preteen stage where your brain and your body are in different chapters.  When will I ever move past it?  Two more nights until the big one!  Jeff's going to be my DDD (designated drunk driver), and I get to crash at his place.  Woohoo!  Crazy stories sure to follow.  Be sure to tune in!

      Pisces Drinking style: If you're a Pisces, you've probably already heard that you share a sign -- and an addictive personality -- with Liz Taylor, Liza Minelli and Kurt Cobain. Not only do Pisces like to lose themselves in the dreamy, out-there feeling that only hooch can give, but they build up a mighty tolerance fast.  Who needs an expensive date like that? On the other hand, theyre fabulously enchanting partners, whether in conversation or in crime.  With the right Pisces, you can start out sharing a pitcher of margaritas and wind up in bed together for days. The phrase "addictive personality" can be read two ways, you know.     urlLink Alcohoroscopes- what do the stars say about your drinking style     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Doesn't really sound like me.  Who am I kidding.  Minus the high tolerance, by george, that is me.

      Well, today definitely tops the list as one of my better days.  Not really sure why, but I have this crazy almost happy feeling.  I got everything I felt about Lily off my chest, I talked to Ryan, I had people I work with tell me how much they'll miss me.  It wasn't people in the office, it was suppliers with other companies.  That really means something.  After four years of jumping from boredom to ulcers (such is the life when you help buy holiday merchandise for a retailer), it's nice to know that someone appreciates you.  I don't think I've ever been told how well I do my job until now.  When they start freaking out about who is going to replace you.  When they realize all of the stuff you do "behind the scenes".  It makes me kind of sad that I'm leaving, but for an adrenaline junkie like me, I know what's ahead is where I'll be happier.  I hate working at a desk job crunching numbers.  I hate numbers!  I can't even balance my checkbook.  How do they expect me to help budget for what we're shipping when?  Ryan was glad to hear from me.  He'll definitely be there Saturday night.  Which is good, but which is also bad.  Give me a little liquid courage, and I'll be sure to tell him all of my suppressed feelings.  So, I'll have to have Jeff around to make sure my mouth stays zipped.  (With the exception of consuming more alcohol.)  I think Lily will be there.  She got the invite when we were still friends.  Her roommate asked me for directions.  Hmmmm......  That'll be interesting.  Once again, liquid courage + conscience drainer comes into play.  I just hope I have the strength to not be stupid.  But, I probably wouldn't have all of my fun stories to tell if I'd always taken the smart road.  I think I'm going to take more idiotic quizzes.

      So my one track mind was focused on sex (or lack thereof) yesterday.  Today I think I'll focus on how not prepared I am for the Army.  I have been slacking on my running.  Now I'm down to about two miles.  I was doing three, at least.  I've gained five pounds, but I think those can be attributed to nights out celebrating my remaining days of freedom doing shots of Jaeger.  Ah, the fun of puking in Pete's Place parking lot at three in the morning, after your breakfast of pancakes with syrup glued your mouth shut.  I've also been slacking on my push-ups.  Granted, I only have to be able to do 3 guy-style ones to get in, which I can do, thrice; but that's not the point.  I was up to fifteen.  Now I'm groaning to get out ten.  And let's not discuss how far I've plummeted in the situp department.   I'm going to miss my crazy life.  I'm looking forward to beginning a new part, but I'm going to miss the debauchery that I've been a part of for the past five years.  I'll miss having the crazy inside jokes w/ Jeff.  He's the greatest guy ever.  "I look like Soleil Moon Frye.  Is that 'Take My Breath Away'?  Will you go home with me?  No?"    "I could bench press you asshole!"  "Fuck Jared and Toby.  Who are they, that's all."   I'm glad to be getting away from the whole Lily situation.  She's not a very good person.  She had made great progress in the "How to be a friend" dept., but as soon as Billy broke up with her, it went out the window.  Billy and Lily, hello......, she should have known it was too Ken and Barbie to work.   Most of all, I'll miss Ryan.  Whatever it is that we have/don't have, I'm scared that there'll definitely be nothing once I'm gone.  Sometimes absence makes the heart grow fonder, but didn't your heart have to be fond to begin with?  I don't think he's as fond of me as I am of him.  My friends tell me that I just need to let him know, because you never know...  But, that's really ridiculous.  Ryan's a big boy.  If he felt that way about me, he probably would have said something by now.  I just don't want to lose our friendship because I said something stupid that he never needs to know.  Know what I mean?

      Wow.  I just read my last post.  That was a really long time ago.  So much has changed, but then again, a lot hasn't.  I'm still single.  I've been dating a few guys, but nothing has come out of it.  I don't really want it to.  I've not met anyone lately that captures my interest.  I'm really just looking to get laid right now, by someone who knows how to do it right.  Call me a 'ho, but I don't want to be in a "relationship".  I just want sex.  The crazy twisted thing is, I want to be respected by the guy I sleep with.  How can I get respect if we're both just in it for sex????  See where I'm having the problem?  Only 24 days until I leave for boot camp.  Kind of scary.  I have to get sex before I go, even if that means sleeping with Eric.  I have a one track mind.  Can you tell that it's been nearly six months since my last sexual encounter?  I don't know what's up with Jared, I think he's got a bug up his ass or something.  Mr. "I don't like girls who play games, but I'll play games with you" really has no fucking clue.  I now understand why he's still single......and probably always will be.  He spent all night staring at Pam's boobs, then has the nerve to hug me as he's leaving and ask me to call him.  For what???  I don't respect you, you don't respect me, that equals no sex.  I'd much rather swim in a river of shit that have to speak to him again.  Okay, out with the frustration.  My going away party thing is this Saturday night at a local pool hall.  All of the guys I've been sort of seeing will be there, and I'll bet I still go home alone.  Because that's my luck.  Anyway.  That's all I can spew right now.  My brain's already in sleep mode.

      Oh Lord!  All around SNAFU today.  I was supposed to leave, but for some reason, they no longer have my high school transcript that has the official graduation date on it.  So, I am delayed until the can get that.  But, it's spring break.  So, everything will probably be delayed until next week.  Woohoo!  What a great way to start, huh?  But, I'll keep you guys informed.  So long as I don't miss my timeframe of getting into the journalism school, I think I'll be okay.

      So, I'm in Little Rock, waiting to ship out tomorrow.  Lots of stuff has been accomplished, but lots is still left undone.  I never did talk to Ryan again.  Not sure whether that was his choice, or my lack of reaching out, but whatever I had to say is still weighing on my mind.  I think it's more his choice.  I guess I've been written off.  I finished w/ my job, and I miss it.  Not so much the work, but all of the people I worked with.  I never did tell Lily to her face how I felt about her bullshit, but that's okay.  I've pretty much let that be.  Kind of like the Jay-Z song "Dirt off my shoulder".  Never did get to have sex.  I think I'll live though.  So, I'm headed off to my next big adventure.  Don't forget me.  And be sure to write me often.  You know my e-mail address.  Grrlpunk7@aol.com.  I'll let you know how I'm doing as soon as I graduate from Basic Training.  I'll miss all of you, lots!  But, I think I'll be okay, so don't worry about me.  I'll be worried for all of you.  Can you believe I'm going to learn how to shoot a gun?  Let's hope I don't have to walk and shoot at the same time.  I'll never be able to hit anything.  Except the ground as I'm falling.  It's amazing how the unknown can be so scary and exciting at the same time.  For those of you who gave me your home mailing address, I'll be sure to fill you in as I go along.  Lots of love!!!  Oh yeah, on a side note, I was officially accepted into the Journalism program for the Army.  I sort of knew I was in, but it's nice to have the official acceptance letter.  Wish me luck!!!

      One week!  And, tomorrow's my birthday.  And my last day at work.  Exciting and scary all in one.  STILL haven't gotten laid.  Maybe I should just forget about sex, and become a nun.  They probably get more action than I do.  I know I'll be going to hell for that.....  I'll have more to write about some other time, but right now I have to do laundry.  How exciting.

      It feels like forever since I last wrote, but not much has changed.  I'm still stupid.  Crazy infatuated with someone who I'm quite sure doesn't care about me in the least.  Well, at least not in the way that I want them to care about me.  I'm supposed to drive up to Joplin to get fireworks today, but I just don't have the energy.  Who wants to spend all of that time in the car???  It's the only place that sells fireworks year-round around here.  Not fun.  Still haven't gotten laid.  And I've had the opportunity.  Just not with the person(s) that I woud like to have it occur with.  Nothing like heading into nine weeks of sexual frustration with six months of it already behind you.  So, I have exactly 11 days to complete all of the following:  Get Laid (preferably more than once, but I'll take what I can get), Get addresses compiled, Forget about Ryan, Finish packing my stuff, Buy military acceptable bras and underwear (did you know that Victoria's Secret is not acceptable???  I didn't), Figure how exactly how much time it's going to take to fix my hair so I can get it all chopped off before I go if I can't hack it, Get Laid, Forget about Ryan...... yeah, so I mentioned them a second time.  They're kind of important.

      They had a going away party for me at work today.  It was really cool.  They all dressed in camo.  Kinda funny.  Totally shocked me.  So, another day, another drama.  Enter Lt. John.  He's cute, funny, nice, everything a good guy should be.  One problem.  I'm really not in the market for a good guy right now.  How is it that I meet all of the good "commitment" types right before I leave?  That's my luck.  Anyway, we went out tonight for Thai food.  Then we raced go-karts and went and played pool.  He's a lot of fun, but I still don't know what I intend on doing.  Big.  Time.  Headaches.  Ryan offered me his migraine medicine.  Totally random, I know.  But, follow me.  I said "headaches", and that reminded me of Saturday night when I said I had a headache, and he offered me the medicine.  Stupid, I know, but I never said I was over the crush-stage, where every little thing he does is magic.  Oh, that could lead me into song, but I won't go there.  Goodnight!

      Me again.  (Well duh, who else would it be?)  It's been an uneventful day.  We had a few formations, I waited in line 3 hours for a drug test, shined my boots, started a letter, got really frustrated with my mom when her cell phone kept breaking up as she was driving through the mountains (though I know it's not her fault).  Then I swept the floor and found out that my morning cleaning duty is cleaning the washing machines.  Exciting.  So, anyway.  You know the question "If a tree falls in a forest, and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?".....  Well, my question is similar.  "If a girl writes a blog, and no one bothers to read it, does she exist?"  Not really parallel, but close.  Just think.  And if you are reading, e-mail me!

      So, happy Memorial Day to all.  I'm sitting in the computer lab, thinking about bidding on something on Ebay.  God Bless internet shopping.  I'll have my whole paycheck spent before it goes into my account tomorrow.  Scary.  I've still got to clean my room sometime before tomorrow, but it's a rainy day, so I'll be spending most of it inside.  I don't think I'll get a chance to play soccer today because of the rain, and the need to clean.  I also have to call my sister in about three hours to find out how her soccer game went.  I don't really like not having a specific list of things that need to be accomplished in a day.  In Basic, we had someone telling us what we needed to be doing at each step.  Now I know that I have to accomplish certain things within the day.  I think going from rigid structure to virtually none at all has messed me up.  It'll take a lot of discipline to get that back.  I'll try though.  I'll be back later!

      I went to the mall today.  Retail therapy always helps.  I bought a soccer ball, two new books, and some playing cards.  We saw Day After Tomorrow.  Not a bad movie, but not one that I'd need to see again.  I had Taco Bell and Carvel ice cream (something I haven't had since I lived in Florida, too many years ago).  I feel like a human again.  Now, if I can convince someone to go and kick around with me, I'll feel complete.  Stupid, I know.  But, I never claimed to be cool.

      Day two in AIT, and I'm crazy bored.  All I have left to do is iron my BDUs, organize my wall locker, and finish making my bed.  That'll take all of two or three hours, so I'm trying to spread that out over today and tomorrow.  I got to take a 30 minute shower last night.  I shaved my legs, conditioned my hair, and used fragrant shower gel.  Then I got to use body cream.  I know it doesn't sound like much to you guys, but that was pure heaven.  Then I got to lie down w/ my discman and listen to the Cranberries while I read a gossip magazine before going to bed.  Yet another luxury that I've missed, the "wind down" period at night.  But, I've got to go.  I might go for a little retail therapy at the PX.  Love ya!

      Hello again!!!  I made it through basic training, and now I'm coming to you live from Ft. George G. Meade, MD.  I learned how to shoot an M-16, throw a grenade, dig a foxhole, all the good stuff.  I learned how to inhale my food in less than five minutes, take a two minute shower, and survive on two hours of sleep.  Now I'm living the easy life here at AIT.  We have internet access (obviously), we're allowed to use the phone whenever we want.  We can go shopping at the base PX whenever we want.  We have only three people in our room, and we can sleep whenever we want on weekends.  We're also allowed to shower whenever we want.  I don't know how to handle all of this freedom.  We're now allowed to have books, magazines, and music.  I was so lost without reading material for 9 weeks. Now all is well.  The only bad thing is that I have all this free time (because it's a weekend), and I don't know how to occupy it.  Isn't that sad???  Nine weeks (actually, 10) ago, I would have complained about not having enough time to see my friends, work, hang out with my family, go out to the club, sleep, and have "me" time.  Now, I have an hour, and I stress about how I'm going to fill it.  But, that's just a Jessica thing.  I stress even when there's nothing to stress about.  I'll be updating this daily, so check back!

      Another day, another episode of sexual frustration.  Seems to be a common topic, huh?  Oh well.  I'm about to pull my hair out.  Nothing seems to be going my way today.  But, I did buy some new shoes.  Woo-hoo!

      A few good sites that everyone should visit.   http://www.avalanchetankers.us/archives/000058.html http://www.bored.com I don't know how to make a link.....I know I'm stupid.  Say no more.  Especially the Army one.  I thought it was funny before....Now, I roll on the floor.

      Well, it's been a while since my last post.  The internet privledges were taken away the the barracks because someone decided to be an idiot and download unauthorized software.  So there's all this stuff about a security breach, and all sorts of higher ups are involved.  And, I'm now suffering from Internet-shopping withdrawls.  I don't know how I'll be able to handle it.  Otherwise, things are good.  Another day, another crush.  I'm stupid, I know.  And, for some reason, every crush I've ever had has always followed the same pattern.  I think it's me......  If the guy is interested in me, there's something wrong with him.  If I'm the one crushing on the guy, then he thinks there's something wrong with me.  I'll never get laid.  That's all there is to it.  I will die sexually frustrated.  Sometimes I wonder if I should have gotten married to Matthew.  Even though I didn't love him.  Sometimes I can't tell if I was lonelier with him than I am now.  I just know that I'm crazy lonely right now.  I don't have anybody that understands where I'm coming from.   That's all I have for now.  I know I need to start whining about things other than matters of the heart, but it's at the forefront.  Hopefully that'll change soon.  (Eleven days until I can be a civilian on weekends, and that means civilian sex!!!)  Love ya

      Today was my first day of classes here at DINFOS (Defense Information School).  There are a lot of nice people in my class.  One especially.  He's rather handsome, too. I'm trying to work my magic, but those of you who know me know that I have no magic.  I have no game.  I can smile, be friendly, even try to flirt (which isn't very good), and all I'll ever be is a friend.  It happens all of the time.

      Yup, me again.  I have so much to do today, but it's stuff like ironing, boot shining, wall locker organizing that I'm just not feeling it.  I'm starting to revert back to my old self.  While I was in Basic, I looked forward to Sundays, because it meant that I'd be able to clean and get my stuff squared away.  Now that I have lots of time, I don't really care.  But, I'll be headed that way in a few minutes.  I'm becoming domesticated, I guess.

      And hello yet again.  I went to the PX and endulged in a little retail therapy that was desperately needed.  Well, maybe not.  My checkbook would disagree.  But, I got my favorite Clinique makeup and some nail polish.  And a Newsweek magazine.  I feel slightly better about life, but now I have buyer's remorse.  I just discovered that Ebay has vehicles for sale.  Watch out world, here I come!!!

      So, today is Saturday.  And it sucks.  It's raining.  I walked my broke ass foot all the way to the gym in the cold rain only to discover that it's closed.  What kind of gym is closed on Saturdays?  Now I get to go and balance my checkbook.  Then we're going to the PX.  Sounds like a barrel of fun, right?  I'm kind of depressed, because I've gained a little bit of weight since Basic Training.  I think it's because I'm still eating like I'm doing all of that physical activity, but I'm actually really lazy all day.  So, I'm getting some chub back, which isn't a good thing.  Now my mission is to retain my basic training figure, maybe improve upon it.  Such is life.  Leave me comments!!!

      Hello from a stormy day at Ft. Meade, MD.  I have spent all day doing a whole lot of nothing.  Aren't you glad the government pays people like me to surf the net?  Instead, they could have given me a week of leave between basic training and AIT, but no.  I have to come directly here, instead of seeing my family, to sit and waste the taxpayers' dollars.  Sounds like typical government.  Anyway.  I've been spending a lot of time dwelling on things I have absolutely no control over (because, what else would you expect from me?), and it's driving me insane.  So, I'll spew this into my post, hopefully without driving you away from my blog forever, and maybe feel an ounce or two better about it.  I cannot stand the fact that I am a complete and total weenie.  I should have told Ryan everything.  I would rather have said it, been done with it, and risked losing his friendship.  Now I sit here and wonder what might have been.  Even though I know the answer to it all.  I know nothing would have happened between us, especially now that I'm gone.  He already had tried the long distance thing with his high school sweetheart, so why would he try it with me?  But I just wish I could have told him.  Even though I'm not his type.  I feel very Bridget Jonesish right now.  I'm the overweight, overly analytical girl.  The one who will eventually be eaten by wild dogs.  I feel like I'm two steps away from singing "All By Myself" on the couch while draining a bottle of wine.  I feel so pathetic, wallowing in my own self-pity.  Okay, new thought.  We're going to have a 3v3 game tomorrow night!!!  I'm really excited about that upcoming event.  So much that I may not sleep tonight.  Just Kidding.  But, the five other people that I came here with Friday night love me just enough (or are tired of hearing about it) that they'll be my fellow teammates/opponents.  So, happiness returns.  But, I'd better go.  There are real students that need to use the computers.

      Man.  I have issues.  I really like the boy.  And that's okay.  I think.  I don't know if he feels the same way, but I can't control how much I like him.  So, there I sit.  Yesterday, we're sitting in his car, he turned to me and said "My ___ looks better now that I'm having sex a lot."  Totally random.  I thought it was funny, and I just had to put that in here.

      Another person in my class just got her orders.  She's going to Germany.  I'm so jealous.  I probably won't get mine until I get off of profile, but I'm about to die of anxiety.  I will not be sane until I know where I'm headed, and even then I'll probably still freak out.  I kind of want to stay here in the U.S. now.  Maybe Ft. Bragg or something close to D.C.  Overseas is too far to make a long distance relationship work.  Way too far.  Even though we'll probably both end up in Iraq.  I'll quit stressing.  Til next time.

      Yup, okay.  I like him.  I can't help it.  So, I'm stuck.  Whenever I get my heart yanked out and stomped on with his giant combat boots, I'll cry here.  So, anyway.  We're planning a big get together for this Friday night.  Hopefully it will be fun.  We'll have a few drinks, Mr. Man and I will sneak away and go to some hotel......Fun stories to follow, to be sure.

      Okay.  I've decided that I'm not interested in this guy anymore.  At least that's what I'm trying to tell myself.  I know that all it will lead to is major heartbreak, so I'm making a pre-emptive decision to use him solely for sex.  Not such a bad thing, right?  I really don't know what I think I'm doing, or why I even care.  I should just let things take their course, but that's not a very Jessica thing to do.  I know I'm stupid, no one has to tell me that.  I just wish I had some idea of what the future holds.  A lot of my friends have gotten their orders.  They've learned that the majority of them will be in Iraq by the first of next year.  I haven't received mine yet, but I'm scared.  I don't want to go.  I thought I did.  I was all for dying for my country, but would I really be doing that?  Or would I be dying for some corporation or lobbyist?  So now I sit here, not knowing where my future lies, whether it be in war or matters of the heart, wishing I could take back the last eight months of my life.  Wishing there was a rewind button that could be magically used just one time.  I'd cash it in right now.

      Hello!!!!  I know everyone out there in my little internet world has missed me terribly....  I finally got some.  Minor problem.  I actually LIKE him.  That's not good.  Now we're "dating" (whatever that means), and I don't know if I like it or not.  I know I complain whenever all I can get is sex, but now that I have a relationship, I don't think I want one.  Sounds crazy, but what else would you expect from me?  I'm having lots of fun in class at Ft. Meade.  Can't you just see me as a radio broadcaster?  Lord knows I'm dysfunctional enough.  But, I'm learning a lot, and I'm having fun.  Hopefully I'll get back into the habit of writing in my online diary.  And hopefully I'll have more to say about the guy.  Hopefully things will turn out the way I want them to, but I don't know what I want, so that's kind of difficult.  I think I'm the type of person that won't be happy, no matter what the situation.  I'm trying to learn how to be a better person, and be happy and optimistic about everything, but old habits die hard.  Who knows.  You may see a new and improved Jessica around the corner.  I'm trying.

      Okay, so I'm back.  I've got a lot weighing on my mind that I can't seem to get out. I can't remember which song it's from, but it's a DMX song.  He raps "I don't get much sleep, my soul's tormented.  I wish it was a lie, but everything I said I meant it.  I know I'm doing wrong, and every day I beg the Lord to forgive me for fucking with a double-edged sword.  Shit ain't going to well, but that's my life.  I know I'm going to hell, but that's my life."  It's always meant something to me.  I laid awake last night wondering how things might have been different.  I wondered what I'd be doing now if I had married Matthew.  Would I be divorced?  Would I have kids (though, we know that can't happen unless it's a miracle)?  I think things started heading downhill for us when we found out that it would be difficult to conceive.  Not that things were ever great, but I think the reason we were together was because we each thought the other would be a good parent.  A stupid reason really, and I know that now.  But all those things I thought I wanted, a husband, a house, kids, a yard, a white picket fence, I knew it would never happen for me.  Now, I don't know what I want.  I don't want to get married.  My mom thinks I'll change my mind someday, but the only reason to get married is to have kids.  Otherwise, you can just live with someone forever, and be perfectly happy.  I don't know that I even want to live with someone forever.  I don't think there's anyone out there that could tolerate me for that long.  I'm always afraid of being hurt, so I never tell people how I feel.  Because if you let them in on your feelings, they have a window to your soul.  And that's how you get crushed.  Stupid rantings, I know.....

      Yeah.  I'm confused.  Always.  I think the only common thread in my posts since I started this blog was confusion.  I over-analyze everything.  I need to learn how to be more patient.  I don't like how things just seem to meander along.  I'm not a meandering kind of person.  I want everything, and I want it now.  And, I'm not used to sitting and waiting for things.  In the past, if I've wanted it, I go out and get it for myself.  I can't do that now.  But, I can't make myself not want it, either.  And, I'm sexually frustrated.  It's only been a week, I know, but when you're having that much REALLY GOOD sex, you kind of begin to crave it.  I think it's possible that I'll be headed into another dry spell.  Yea!!!  I wish I were back home, and I wish Justin were around.  Then I would have a backup plan.  Now I'm all alone at Ft. Meade, no one around to do (excluding the one I want to do, of course), and no way to find someone.  Any ideas???

      Well, it's Sunday, and Sunday sucks.  This has been the worst week of my life, and I'm glad it's almost over with.  Now I only have 12 days left until I'm on a plane back home.  Even though I'll only be home for a week, I'm excited.  I miss my life, and I miss who I was.  It's not that I'm not that person anymore, I just felt more comfortable in my own skin back home.  Here I'm always afraid that I'm doing something wrong.  And I try so hard to make people like me.  I think it works, most people think of me as a nice person.  At home, I had my friends, and we could go out and have a good time.  I didn't have nearly as many dating issues back home.  There was always someone to go out with.  Now, I'm here bored, wishing I had someone to date, because it'd be nice to take my mind off of things.  I guess that's why rebounds are so important.  But, I can't because I don't want to just throw myself at anyone, and I don't really care to get involved with anyone else around here.  I now know the meaning of "Don't shit where you eat".  Anyway, back to what's going on.  I just got off my fireguard shift.  I still have my homework to do, but my policy letters have been written.  Speaking of policy letters, I discovered that the fraternization rules apply regardless of branch of service.  Which means I'm not allowed to see Tornetta.  :(  Hehehe, anyway.  We went out last night, and I fell asleep during the movie.  It's not that it wasn't a good movie, I was just so tired from the lack of sleep the night before.  And, there were post-it notes on doors this morning!!!  Thank God they finally hooked up!  I'm glad I went out with the group on Friday.  I don't think I've had that much fun in a while.  We were doing pushups on the floor in the bar.  Totally drunk, but somehow I managed to squeeze out three diamond pushups in heels!  Then Spada did pullups in the ladies room.  It was a crazy night.  I still don't know who puked more.  I miss getting that drunk.  I'm not saying I'm going to do it all of the time, but it's been too long.  Anyway, my nicotine craving is screaming.  Later!

       Save Yourself by Stabbing Westward  I know your life is empty And you hate to face the world alone So you're searching for an angel Someone who can make you whole  Chorus: I cannot save you I can't even save myself  I know that you've been damned Your soul has suffered much abuse But I am not your savior I am just as fucked as you  (Chorus)  Please don't take pity on me  My life has been a nightmare My soul is fractured to the bone So, if I must be lonely I think I'd rather be alone   In the Absence of Sun by Duncan Sheik  For all the good you say it does It seems no better when you've had your say You may believe it's just because The words get colder when you've gone away I thought I understood What I was to you...  Chorus: I don't want to feel this way I don't want to say I'm just a friend I don't want to wait around here 'Cause you don't want to feel no pain again We just lie about it... As we become shadows of ourselves  Some may fear committed lives I sure am one of them without you Does it come to you as some surprise I laid the ground beneath to doubt you Was it ever girl Something you could hold...  (Chorus)  I don't want to look away I don't want to be the one denied It ain't no fault of mine 'Cause someone, somewhere told you lies But we don't talk about it We just become shadows of ourselves

      I think I may be too hard on the boy. I don't know. I know I care about him a lot. I know that if you love someone, you have to let them go. If they come back, then it's real. I'm not too sure that he'll come back, but I hope he does. I like him. I could spend some time with this one. Another thing that scares me. I usually get bored really quickly, with the exception of a few bad decisions on my part. Nah, not bad decisions, experiences....I'll chalk it up to experience. Gus was a good experience, Josh was a not so good experience. And Justin, well, the jury's still out on that one. He's still got me confused, and it's been a while. That poor boy. I'll bet he's married to Holly by now, and probably still cheating on her with all of the available women from work. I don't understand people who cheat. If you don't want to be in a relationship, you should not be in one. There's no shame in being single. For the most part, I was happily single. Okay, not really, I'd say it was more 50-50. But it was always fun to have a crush. Until you get to know them and find out they're nothing like you expected. So, even crushing has its ups and downs. Then I meet someone who strikes my fancy. And I got lucky. I was mooning over him for a month, and the actual person was better than the daydream version. Back to the original topic, I'm not bored with him, not yet. Who knows where it will all end up. I feel like I'm in a Jane Green novel. That's exactly what it is. Straight Talking by Jane Green. Well, maybe not. More of a mix between Bookends and Straight Talking. I need to find another good author. I've gone through all of her books, and all of the other books I have. I don't have books. How depressing. Especially for me. I can't stand being without something to read. I need to finish reading/editing/whatever else the boy's manuscript, but it's been kind of tough to focus lately. I'll get back on that this weekend. After I complete my punishment for fraternization. Yup, that's right. I will be hand-writing policy letter #14 ten times as corrective training. Pretty pathetic. I had to buy real-size notebook paper today, just for that. And I have to iron my BDUs, polish my boots, shower and get gorgeous for tonight. Scary business, it is. Last night was a lot of fun. We went to Fell's Point, had too much to drink (way too much), met some interesting people. Delker got a date, and she was trying to set me up with his friend, but she doesn't understand that her type is NOT my type. Stank and Spada went, and they got harrassed about a lack of post-it notes on doors. Spada had told us that whenever she finally got some, she was going to start putting post-it notes on our doors when she came home. I had jokingly added, "We should all start leaving them on the doors, color coded ones." They told me that I had to leave one up there when I didn't get any, because otherwise I'd go broke having to stock that many post-its. So, after we finished teasing Spada, they turned to me and said "And we'll be expecting a post-it from you tonight B." What are friends for, huh? So anyway. I have to go, because I've been wasting away my precious policy letter writing time. This is crazy, absolutely crazy!!! Oh yeah, let me add. I called Ryan today to schedule a racquetball game for when I'm home in two weeks, and I'm meeting Jared (yes, unfortunately that one, but Jeff will be there to protect me) at Brewski's for Guinness and pool. Hopefully I'll run into a few others while I'm back home. It'd be good to see the old friends. I'm going to meet Cheryl for lunch sometime. I still think she'd be the coolest mother-in-law. But I digress.

      Ah, such is the life. I have got to be one of the biggest idiots this side of the Mississippi (which is funny, because before I came here I was the biggest idiot on the other side of the Mississippi). Does it make sense to anyone else that he cares about me, but he's going to fuck this other chick? Because I'm not seeing it. How can you claim to care about a person, then tell them you're going to have a meaningless relationship with someone else, know that person A sees you and the "meaningless" chick around, and expect them to want to continue a relationship with you when they're able to? Am I wrong for feeling slighted in this? I just want to feel okay, you know? And not feel like I'll never be good enough for the guys that I really like. Because that's how it seems so far.

      I think I'm going to start posting a daily song (or weekly).  Here's kind of where I'm at right now.  Inside Out, #10 on Yellowcard's Ocean Avenue.   Here, a little sympathy For you to waste on me I know you're faking it but that's okay And I don't want to drag it out Don't want to bring you down I never wanted it to end this way  Chorus: Even if I wanted to I don't think that I'd get to you There's nothing I can say to you To make you feel alive again  Here, a little jealousy I hope you think of me Hope you wonder where I sleep at night 'Cause I feel like I'm inside out You've got me upside down Maybe I was holding on too tight  (Chorus)  So don't you say goodbye to me Just turn your back away and leave And if you're lucky I will be Your last regret, your only friend  The two of us we dream like one The two of us, the two of us The two of us take breath like one The two of us, the two of us  I guess that this is over now I guess it's called a falling out But everyday I'm learning how To make it through this life I'm in  (Chorus)  So don't you say goodbye to me Just turn your back away and leave And if you're lucky I will be Your last regret, your only friend.   And #4, Empty Apartment, on the same album:   Called me out, you stayed inside One you love is where you hide Shot me down as I flew by Crash and burn I think sometimes You forget where the heart is  Answer no to these questions Let her go learn a lesson It's not me you're not listening now Can't you see something's missing You forget where the heart is  Chorus: Take you away from that empty apartment You stay and forget where the heart is Someday if you ever loved me you'd say It's okay  Waking up from this nightmare How's your life? What's it like there? Is it all what you want it to be? Does it hurt when you think about me? And how broken my heart is  (Chorus)  It's okay to be angry and never let go It only gets harder the more that you know When you get lonely if no one's around You know that I'll catch you when you're falling down We came together but you left alone And I know how it feels to walk out on your own Maybe someday I will see you again And you'll look me in my eyes and call me your friend  (Chorus)

      So, I'm supposed to meet up with him today (sort of like yesterday, but maybe today he'll show). I know I'm asking for more trouble, and curiousity killed the cat, but who wouldn't be curious? Who would begrudge me the answers? I don't have the answers for anything anymore. I thought I did. I thought I knew where I stood with him, but I guess I never did at all. Maybe I'll get the answers tonight, maybe not. I'm learning to overcome quickly though. I still feel hurt, but I think it's kind of numb really. I have always said I need to learn how to detach my heart from things, I guess experience in heartbreak is the only way to do it. And I'm getting plenty of experience. Wish me luck!

      Welcome to my idiotic life. I hear one thing, I see another, and I'm more confused than when I started. I think I'll just curl into the fetal position and die now. How could anyone be so stupid? How can I be so stupid? If you cared about someone, would you immediately start seeing someone else? Especially if the former were still interested in you, but circumstances had changed? Would you try to work around it? I have so many questions, no answers, and a headache from hell. I know I just need to forget about everything and move on, but I can't. I still see him every day. And I see him hanging out with her. Which makes me jealous. I wish that I could sit next to him at chow again. Why is this so difficult???

      I am the biggest idiot in the whole world. Yesterday, everything seemed cool. He talked about things cooling down for a bit. Today, he's looked through me, and as far as I know, we're done. I knew I shouldn't have gotten involved with him. I knew that it would only lead to heartbreak. Every time I've ever trusted anyone, they've fucked me over. And here I am, yet again. It's the hurt me once, shame on you; hurt me twice, shame on me adage. And, a true friend stabs you in the front. The only thing I asked of him when we started this whole deal was to be honest with me. How can that be too much???

      I am still butt-crazy over the boy.  How retarded am I?  I know I'm forbidden to see you, and I could lose everything if I continue to see you, but I still want to see you.  I want to hold your hand, kiss you, drive in your car, have mad crazy sex with you, listen to you talk about nothing at all.  And I'll never get to do it again.  It reminds me of a quote that someone at work in my previous life had sent me.  "The worst way to miss someone is to be sitting beside them, knowing you can't have them."  I don't know who said it, but it's very true.  I still see him all of the time.  And I'm fucking invisible to him.  And he is to me.  Which breaks my heart.  I know that's the way it has to be, but it doesn't make it any less painful.  I want all of this to go away and be nothing, but it can't.  We can't go back to where we were.  Tragic, just tragic.

      I HAVE ORDERS!!!!  Yes, that's right.  This girl (yes, this one right here) is headed to Ft. Bragg!!  I'm excited, but I'm not exactly sure what I'll be doing.  The boy and I are finished.  We were discovered by drill sergeants over the weekend, and I'm getting in trouble for fraternization.  So, I told him we can't see each other anymore.  My heart is breaking.  This hurts, a lot.  But, I'll just have to rise above it, right?  I've had enough heartbreak in my life to know that this is just a minor blip on the radar screen.  How can it be minor though?  I truly care about him.  He makes me laugh, we have good conversations, the sex is AWESOME.  Can you ever really ask for more in a relationship?  And it's forbidden.  How romantic.  Everbody loves a good Romeo and Juliet story.  Now I'll go drink my poison.
