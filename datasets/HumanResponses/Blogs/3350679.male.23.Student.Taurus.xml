      well it is the bank holiday and millions of people will do what ever stupid little crap they do with the excitment of having a whole extra day away from their places of work.  Me on the other hand is going to be desperatley trying to get a job and then trying to find somewhere any where to live and along with that trying not to hit someone or something   My Aunt and Uncle want me out fine I say but since I have no maony and do not know where I am going this is proving to be a bit of a fucking challenge for me and they have the nerve to pretend that they are doing this out of some way helping me with quotes such as   "we just want you to be with people your own age"  Fuck you jesus I have really being enjoying my time down here in Yorkshire but these last few weeks have really fucked me off about everything I am in the exact position I was last year with no direction but instead of having really cool friend s around that helped me like I did in Aberdeen I have a nurotic uncle and aunt putting pressure on me to fit into their idea of a perfect clone of I dont know what only I do not want to be it   that it for now let u know if I have killed anyone  Ps I dont care if there is spelling maistakes because I can not be bothered about spell checking this  Stephen

      In the middle of a major not knowing what to do phase just filling out job application after job application at the moment.  But apart from that I do not have a hell of a lot to do so am thinking up new ways of wasting time.  Still not totally wasted time I have started watching my DVD of coupling.  Really good and really funny.  The 4th season has just started coming out although without Jeff got to admit I am cynical about how they can keep it up without jeff but been looking at what people are saying it does okay  Cu later

      Just completing one of my final essays of the course.  It is on the question of regeneration partnerships and democratic deficit  but that is not what is worrying me I have basically decided that my life has to have some direction in the next 3 weeks because by that time I will be going slightly crazy with cabin fever so I best get on with those applications.  Tomorrow I will begin too look for some part time work which will hopefully give me a bit of a direction.  Besides my aunt and uncle say its will be "good for me" and "allow me to meet people" I really hate this thing in my family that require people to micromanage my life. So looking for new place to stay at the moment   lets hope something comes up soon eh
