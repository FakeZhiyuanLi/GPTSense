      We decided to camp at Castlefreke on Friday night thinking we were bound to find some clean waves around somewhere. When we arrived it looked big and messy but just about surfable, there were a few guys who had just left the water too. We decided to pitch the tent and get a quick surf in before dark. Big mistake. It took us over an hour to get the tent up! In the end we just jammed the supporting sticks into the ground and secured the tent with a few pegs :) It did the job. By that stage it was dark so we got a fire going and cooked a few burgers.   In the morning we managed to get a little surf in at the Freke, everywhere else was flat really. It wasn't exactly inviting but we thought we'd go for a splash anyway. Some of the lads headed to Castlegregory after that but I had to head back to Cork for a party. They got a surf in at Dumps the next day  Sunday was a gorgeous day, a bit windy but really sunny. The wind was blowing onshore at Garrettstown but the waves were only just over a foot so it was still ok for a mess around. Got some nice little waves but the swell really dropped off later in the day.   Garrettstown is really starting to look like some beach resort in England with several chipper vans and donkey rides on the beach! Good to see some life around though, there must have been around 30 body-boarders in the shallows. You'd wonder how many will carry on and take it up seriously? One, two?   The lifeguards are moving in next weekend, and will be around every weekend until July when they move in full time. That's when you know you can leave your board behind! Still, there's always those rogue swells that hit us every now and then. Lets hope it's a good summer!    Cormac Heads Home.  urlLink      Garrettstown Sunday.  urlLink

      Just messing about on blogger.com here. Thinking about using this to record a surf diary.  I'll post pics and a report of what the surf was like, and maybe I'll save the WAM charts so you can compare the conditions. Who knows? If you want to be a part of this diary just email me and I can set you up too.

      The last few days haven't been too bad, well, at least there was some waves. Even though I've managed to get out everyday since Friday I still don't really feel too satisfied. Saturday was the best day by far, there was a nice enough wave in Garylucas, not the Garylucas I've grown to know and love but a smaller, tamer version. There was a good crowd in the water and a bit of banter, all in all a fairly good sesh.   There was a guy ripping up with his kite too, that looks like a lot of fun! This guy must have been getting twenty foot airs off little two foot waves. Hopefully the cost of the equipment will drop at some stage, it's still a little too pricey for me.  Sunday was pretty poor in comparison, the waves were weak and the rip was strong so there was a hell of a lot of paddling done. There seems to be a lot of sand movement in Garrettstown lately, in particluar there's a really strong rip in front of the bigger groyne. Maybe we'll see some nice sandbars forming. At the moment the outside waves are just backing off and the inside is closing out. Still though, if you can get the right one on the inside you can have a lot of fun!    Crevin Taking Off.

      Got some small surf at Garrettstown this evening after work. 1-2ft windslop was all it was but it looked better than a kick in the nads. Really weak waves with miserable rides, but you'd find the odd one that peaks up and gives you a nice drop. Good practice I suppose.   There was about 10 or 11 people on the inside, swimming, surfing and body boarding. There was a fairly fun shore break, but it was mostly closing out.    If you weren't there you didn't miss much.

      Managed to find some nice clean waves at an undisclosed location on the West Coast this Bank Holiday weekend. I arrived to see someone get a lovely 3 or 4 second cover up so it looked promising. Didn't manage to get tucked in myself but caught a few beauties all the same. The water was so clear you could see every stone and piece of seaweed on the bottom. As the tide dropped and the sun came out things just got better. Most of the lads stayed out all day long, getting a few sessions in.     Paddling for a left-hander.       They did tend to close out a bit though.  urlLink      Waiting for a good one.  urlLink

      You know it's been flat when I've nothing better to do than make changes to the website, it's as if I'm trying to fill in the void that's left by weeks of wavelessness. You look out at 6-inch surf and think to yourself "You know....maybe I could ride that......just maybe....." Drives you kind of crazy in the end, especially if you try to ride those ankle-slappers!    So I turn to upgrading the  urlLink weather service  on the site. It's now actually a really handy page cause you can see at a glance what the next five days are going to be like. If you've got a mobile phone with a color screen you can access these images on your phone by going to http://www.corksurf.com/wap/ You may need to clear your phones browser cache to make sure you're looking at the latest version, on some phones there's a menu option for this, I just switch off my phone and switch it back on again. A small inconvenience for the benefits of getting the charts when you're in the pub.     I've also done some work on a new version of the chatterbox, one that will actually archive what you people have to say rather than just spit it out. You'll be able to search the archive and relive the banter. Or at least that's the idea.    Looks like there might be some windslop later tonight.... I think I might be able to ride that....

      Looks like it's gonna be flat for the next few weeks. Mother Atlantic has gone to sleep, right on queue at the start of July. I dunno what I'm gonna be doing during the flat spells, it's surprising we don't turn to drugs and inner-city crime. I start to itch after a few weeks without surf. Luckily for me I've got a holiday to look forward too, we're off to the Canaries for at least a week, maybe two, in September.  There is one little piece of good news though, I read in this months Carve that they're expecting a busier than usual hurricane season this year. Nice one! Is this the last post until September?!?

      The Beach Cleanup was on today. It wasn't exactly the super-huge turnout we were hoping for but we got by. :) Thanks to everyone who came out! In the end we collected over 11 bags of rubbish!  It came as quite a shock as to how much rubbish there actually was on the beach.   After about an hour and a half we decided to call it quits and head to Inchydoney for some longboarding. The surf was tiny but that didn't stop Ivan from snaking us all (including his own girlfriend! Bad form Ivan! :P)   Thanks again to everyone for coming down, here's a pic of *some* of us with the rubbish. ;)
