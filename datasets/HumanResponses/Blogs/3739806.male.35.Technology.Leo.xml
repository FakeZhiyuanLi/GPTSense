      Offical feel sorry for myself day. Spent a good part of the day talking to a female friend at work about XXXXX. I think she likes me but I just plain am not attracted to her.  She called me up at 2 A.M. lol, I think she was drunk and wanted to get laid. I didn't answer the phone. I have hit rock bottom with this process, I am ready to kick ass and take down names. XXXXX called me and really wanted me to go out. I think he was trying to hook me up.  I told him I would go but I flaked out.

      Went out last night with XXXXX and his construstion worker friends. I felt a little out of place, these guys were all really buff and me being skinny. They were very nice a little too nice mostly. I had fun though lots of beautiful fun girls. Helped me put the whole XXXXX situation into perspective. Funny thing is when it ended with XXXXX a few years ago I could not wait to jump into another womans arms, now it seems like no one is good enough. What does that mean? Does that say something about me or about my relationship with XXXXX?  I caught XXXXX in a little white lie. Playing games.... Trying to get me to chase her. *Sigh* is anyone ever going to live up to my standards?   Ha ha here is something funny. The girl that has been emailing me... Turns out some of her friends wrote some of the emails thinking she was going to screw it up with me. Which she did but not because of the emails. I called her up and talked to her. Classic case of someone seeming attractive until you have a real conversation with them. Not because she was stupid. Because she was closed minded. Seemed to have very narrow opinions about life the universe and everything.

      Seemingly exciting but somehow boring to me day.  1st day that my new sign-up went in effect for the company that I work for.  Normal debugging stuff…yawn.  Went on date with a girl who has two beautiful great kids.   However she (my date) turns out to be boring.  Lots of things turn out bad about the date.  She wears perfume that reminds me of my Grandma. Conservative gal who is trying to act like a bad girl and just didn’t sell it that well. The way she dressed screamed older conservative gal looking for boring conservative guy.    Also of note been emailing a girl I met online.  I’ll let the emails speak for themselves:  Her:    i am funny... but i have to tell you it is rarely me (although this is me right now)  who replies or even started the correspondence with people... the girls  here at work did my profile initially (i have since put  my own cynical biting twist on things)... so i have no idea who theyve  written too or what theyve said... although we pretty much all think  alike and XXXXX is way funnier than me... so youll have to tell me what  you think is funny so i can gloat and preen and tell you its me... or  else ill have to fess up that its not me whos funny its probably angie...  as far as pda... im not afraid to tell people to go get a room... im ok  with hand holding and stuff... but no serious making out thats gonna  make everybody want to go take a shower cuz they feel dirty and violated  (and not in the good spanky kinda way... ya know what im saying???)   and yes ***** is a titty bar... i also like ***** as  well... so anyway... hope to hear back from you about how funny i am...  and then dont forget to comment about how pretty my dog is!!!!  (just  kiddin)      Me:   No I don't know what you are saying...  "Making out thats make everybody want ot take a shower cuz they feel dirty and violated"  That's a bit of a projection don't you think??? You should tell me about your childhood sometime.   Funny... Dirty and violated is how I feel when I pay to watch girls dance nude.  It just seems so degrading. I guess that is why I rarely pay for dates... I feel like I'm paying for their attention. Much better if they are with me because of my wit, charm and personality.  XXXXX hmmm. You must know my old freind. xxxxx  I hear he pratically lives there these days.  You are funny or at least your profile is. Your dog looks like he/she gives big wet slobbery kisses that would make you want to take a shower....  Her:     there really isnt anything to tell about my childhood... its just a  personal preference... im not saying that im not an exhibitionist  (although i like to fancy myself a voyeur) you know... i can be mischievious  and daring and naughty... i just dont like people bumping and grinding in  front of me... especially if im not involved.     and really you must know... i absolutely adore my parents... they truly  walk on water and i was just being cheeky with my response about what  ive learned from them...    if you dont know what im saying when i say the good spanky way... well  then ill have to use my big girl words next time... cuz i dont know how  to be more clear without being scientific about it...   and xxxxx i fear we are on two different planets... im sad about how  you feel about titty bars... but i think you and i feel differently about  it perhaps because of the reasons i go there versus the reasons you go  there... and truly... if i had a body like some... well anyway thats a  conversation for much later i assure you becuase then we start getting  into a whole lotta other stuff... so just keep that in mind... there  will more to discuss later...    and its me thats funny... not just my profile... im the one who has  revamped my profile and made it wittier and more clever... so its really  me thats funny.. and i love that!!!     xxxxx isnt allowed to lick... it drives me insane... (and not in the fun  spanky way... ya know what im saying???)  see i am funny...     chat with you soon... and you cant sign your email with my name    Me:     LOL, let me get this right.  It is ok for girls to strip naked and dance suductively in front of you, you even like it, but PDA's are bad? It has been well over 5 years since I have been in a "titty bar" and that was just because I was going to Bacelors party for a friend. I don't go because I prefer to get to know someone before I want to get stimulated by them visually. Kinda like have you ever met someone who you though was cute until they opened their mouth and started talking? Mischievious and daring sounds like fun. I'm all about the F word FUN!!!     If PDA's are teasing, flirting and fun I am totaly down with that.     You are witty that is for sure... However I suspect you are somewhat of a brat!     I guess I am sucker so I'll give you a shot anyway.  God I give and give...     Do you have cell phone?  Her:      i am not a brat!!!  i am deeply hurt... plus the girls at work read  what i thought was extremely witty verbage from me to you and they thought  i was icky too!!! so im sad now... and really you just cant get your  message across in emails... the tone of voice, the nuance... it just gets  lost across the high speed internet connection and the dsl cable... and  as far as the diachotomy you so adeptly picked up on... did you not  read the part in my profile that said im a gemini???  and i told you... if  im not involved in the pda... then its just not worth it.  oh - by the  way, i got yelled out by the girls at work.  they said i have to start  using punctuation and stop using the ...'s which i just dont know if  (oops i mean don't) i can.  it takes a lot of time to push the shift key  and find the ' mark (which by the way... doesnt, oops there i go  again... doesn't require the shift buttom) so anyway - back to the gemini  part... thats what (f*&^ the punctuation!!) im good at - changing my mind  from one moment to the next, one minute something is just fine... and  the next its not so fine... you never know!!!  thats what makes me so  fun (only because it gives people a perfect excuse to do drugs!! just  kiddin)  ok so about the cell phone thing.. yes i have one.. but wonder if  we coud do this instead... (cuz just a little heads up... i am all bark  and no bite) im reticent to give you my cell... but you can give me  your number and ill call you back and then we can discuss an exchange of  numbers... okey dokey??  you email me back and let me know if this works  for you...  ill talk to you soon...   ME:   I'm getting your wit, I don't think you are getting mine. ;)  It is just a cell phone number?  You are a brat!  I give you my number... You call me... then boom I have your number???  I don't get what the difference is...  Unless you are just playing some bratty game with me.  All bark and no bite? So what is this some kind of game then?  Ah well I don't think you could handle me anyway.     Her:     i swear im not a brat... and fine... 555-5555... and i can handle more  than you know...       Her:      Hey! okay so ive been thinking..maybe youre right, maybe i am being a little bit of a brat. i am new to this whole on-line thing and am a bit fiesty by nature. although i am definitley NOT a brat, i am actually a really caring, sweet person i just have a sarcastic streak. its hard to read people through e-mail, so maybe this e-mail business should just be a companion to some phone calls???? what do you think?  anyway, lets start over and i promise i will try to be a little less abrasive.   why don't you tell me a little about yourself, i don't even know what you do? I noticed your profile says you like to read. is that just the occasional shampoo bottle and stop sign, or are you an avid reader? I love to read, and i love to learn about new books, so you should make a suggestion to me. i just finished the new david sedris book, which made me howl.   all right... well i don't want to get ahead of myself here, so why don't you just let me know if you accept my invitation to forgive me.     Me:      I like your fiesty attitude, beside being a brat would just give me a reason to spank you.  I used to read lots of Sci Fi, of late though it is hard for me to get into fiction.  I could recommend some books but I think I should talk to your first.  I want it to be a good recommend. I will call you Thursday after work I stayied up late working and I am tired. BTW I'm computer programmer.   Her:     spank me huh???  my brother jsut got married and i went to my  sister-in-laws bridal party (well thats what it was advertised as...) and soon  found out it was one of those f#&*erware parties!!!!  what fun... there  was a little cat-o-nine whip and i did try it out... it wasnt very  exciting though... i think i would have liked it had it been a guy spanking  my bare ass and not a girl (in the good spanky kinda way... ya know  what i mean??)  anyway... ill chat with you tomorrow.  david sedaris' new  book is a scream (just fyi)   END OF EMAILS:   I have been missing XXXXX very badly. However I stand by my choice to let her go with out a fight. It is tragic when two people love each other but just work out the circumstances. I know we both in the long run will be happier with other people. God I miss her though, but must remain strong. I have removed everything that would remind me of her and hopfully talking about it here will help get over the heart ache.  Oh also I had a great IM converstaion with XXXX. I hope to see her in October. I am hopeful but realistic about her. Although we have a really great chemistry and connection I fear the distance between us is too great.
