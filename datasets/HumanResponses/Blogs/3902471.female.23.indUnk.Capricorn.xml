						   Though I love myself...that is...who I am.  It seems that being me has very little rewards.  I compromise, I listen, I give, I care, I understand...and it's not that I do these things on special occassions....I do these things and more all the time, with or without reward.  The sad part is that as time passes THANK YOU's cease.  Why must people become so comfortable that they forget to appreciate the goodness and kindness of ones heart?  I give, they take...not a problem for me...BUT can they show appreciation or the least say THANK YOU.  I sometimes wish I was a selfish coldhearted person; but how will that make me any better than those who don't use the words THANK YOU within their vocabulary?  It's a lose-lose situation...Is that what a relationship is?  Lose-Lose?  It can't be...there has to be more in the long run...BUT can I make it that far?  Will I continue to go unappreciated?  Can I ever love more than just myself?  Will I ever feel as appreciated as I do him?

						   I try to understand the many actions of those surrounding me; but gain frustration instead.  I try to explain what's inside...and it's as if I go unheard.  How can one speak in hopes of someone understanding?

						     Every obstacle is like a stepping stone, playing a role in one's consciousness. We often see the goal, however fear we may not be able to attain it. Believe, is correct. Believe you can, and GOD will definetely move whateva oceans he needs to, in order for you to make it. Remember your friends believe in you and are willing to do just as much as we are capable of, for your dream to draw nearer. You do not have to feel alone, aside from GOD, there are many others who have been placed in your pathway for you to gain from. Be it knowledge, love, or just sheer patience take it for what it's worth. GOD is within us all. Meaning that divine potential is a mere prayer away.

						   Today I came one step closer to one of my many goals.&nbsp; I took a step, perhaps a leap...and came to find that it isn't as hard as I thought.&nbsp; I too, like many others, can walk over the bridge.&nbsp; I'm so excited to move forward; to continue on this journey.&nbsp; To be what I want to be; to do what I want to do.&nbsp; It is GOD's will afterall...and he gave me the strength to make it.&nbsp; He gave me the trust (in myself) to walk forward and believe.&nbsp; That's all you have to do in this world to make.&nbsp; BELIEVE...believe that GOD is there with you.&nbsp; That he is watching you and making sure that each and every turn you take...is for a reason.&nbsp; Be it a bad experience to make you stronger ... or an accomplishment to give you reason to BELIEVE! Luv GOD...he is with us.

						   Boi...where do I start?&nbsp; LMAO.&nbsp; I know a lot of you out there feel me...when it's pay day and the check has yet to arrive.&nbsp; Seriously, what do these employers take us for.&nbsp; Do they forget that in order for employees to produce...they must produce the CHECK.&nbsp; LOL.&nbsp; It's the same story day in day out.&nbsp; Better said...it's the same story every 15th and 30th of the month (SALARY).&nbsp; Then the sad part is ... when your check don't come in for the right amount.&nbsp; Well I must say...I doubt the system will ever change.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Cause we accept it.&nbsp; Just by continuing to be there day after day...we accept the system that continues to work against us.&nbsp;

						   Work work work...seems like the only thing done.  Hectic mornings...hectic afternoons...frustrating nights.  That's all work work work gives.  Today I helped a friend; I've been in her shoes...it ain't no joke - to have drama on a day to day.  It's quite exhausting to be unable to take time for yourself...at least today I have taken time for someone else.  This world has forgotten to enjoy the day to day.  I have forgotten to stop and smell the roses.  Sounds a lil corny...but it's the truth.  I vow that from this day forward I will only stress the things that truly have a significance in my life...and believe you me if it's significant it better not cause me no stress.  I will be stress free...I will do things that will better myself and those who truly care for me.  I will no longer stress those people and/or things that cause nothing but anguish within me.  Fuk it...it's my life, I have to take control.  NO MORE DRAMA!
