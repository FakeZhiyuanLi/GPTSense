      it's 2:26 am now and i'm still awake...i don't know why?! i know i have to wake up early later for school because i have to attend the cheer dance competition and the volleyball competition...it's our intramurals already...my friends wanted me to come...and i owe them...i need to support them...they need me-they need us!  Go USC college of commorse...i know that we can do it...let's show to them, who is the best...  *yawns*  i guess i have to sleep now...but i still can't shut my eyes...though i keep on yawning that is...  what's wrong with me?! maybe because i'm thinking too much of my honey...  i just finished talking to him through e-mail...he told me he's going to sleep already...  shish! what's with my honey that keeps me holding on to this long distance relationship of ours?! is this what they call LOVE?! well then, love it is...  i still have to wait for 2 d*mn years before he comes home here in the philippines...and by then he could visit me...2 years ladies and gentlemen...2 nerve recking years as what he calls it!!!!!!  i have to be very patient and understanding than i have ever been in my entire life...if i want our relationship to last then i have to do so...  i love my honey so much, that's why i'm doing this for him-for me-for us...  *yawns*  it's 2:33am already...and i really have to sleep...i'll try sleeping now...it's pretty much late for me to be awake...hope i could get a good night rest...  2:37 and i'm logging off now...  *yawns*  what a day...
