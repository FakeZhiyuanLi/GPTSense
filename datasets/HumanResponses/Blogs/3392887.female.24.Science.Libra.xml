      I am currently reading The Teachings of Don Juan: A Yaqui Way of Knowledge by Carlos Castaneda. So far the book is pretty good, my dad gave it to me and told me it was about how to become a physicist. At Fermi Lab right now I am surrounded by mostly people that have PhD's in physics or like me are graduate students in physics. All in all a pretty smart bunch of people. I tend to shy away from them, because in my head they are all smarter than me and never had any problems getting things to work like I do, so in fact, they are better, but are they? or are they just older and more experienced?  Tonight I read an interesting passage in the book that I thought I would pass along:       "When a man starts to learn, he is never clear about his objectives. His purpose is faulty; his intent is vague. He hopes for rewards that will never materialize for he knows nothing of the hardships of learning.      "He slowly begins to learn -bit by bit at first, then in big chunks. And his thoughts soon clash. What he learns is never what he pictured, or imagined, and so he begins to be afraid. Learning is never what one expects. Every step of learning is a new task and the fear the man is experiencing begins to mount mercilessly, unyieldingly. His purpose becomes a battlefield.       "And thus he has stumpled upon the first of his natural enemies: Fear! A terrible enemy - treacherous, and difficult to overcome. It remains concealed at every turn of the way, prowling, waiting. And if the man, terrified in its presence, runs away, his enemy will have put an end to his quest."       "What will happen to the man if he runs away in fear?"       "Nothing happens to him except that he will never learn. He will never become a man of knowledge. He will perhaps be a bully, or a harmless, scared man; at any rate, he will be a defeated man. His first enemy will have put an end to his cravings."       "And what can he do to overcome fear?"       "The answer is very simple. He must not run away. He must defy his fear, and in spite of it he must take the next step in learning, and the next, and the next. He must be fully afraid, and yet he must not stop. That is the rule! And a moment will come when his first enemy retreats. The man begins to feel sure of himself. His intent becomes stronger. Learning is no longer a terrifying task.       "When this joyful moment comes, the man can say ithout hesitation that he has defeated his first natural enemy."       "Does it happen at once, don Juan, or little by little?"       "It happens little by little, and yet the fear is vanquished suddenly and fast."       "But won't the man be afraid again if something new happens to him?"       "No. Once a man has vanquished fear, he is free from it for the rest of his life because, instead of fear, he has acquired clarity - a clarity of mind which erases fear. By then a man knows his desires; he knows how to satisfy those desires. He can anticipate the new steps of learning, and a sharp clarity surrounds everything. The man feels that nothing is concealed."   Maybe we all get to a point where we are too scared to continue. For some this would probably happen much earlier in life. When I tell people that I am a physics graduate student they give me this look of terror and say things like, "oh my god I could never do that," or "you must be so smart" I want to tell these people that no, I am really probably a lot like you I just get up every day, knowing that I am probably going to have difficulties in doing whatever it is I need to do that day. However, it always gets done, there is always people around to help....and there is always my goddamn Welty stubborness that keeps me trying. Who knows where I will end up, right now I am terrified of being here and what I am doing, but i am hoping that as the days and weeks go on I will gain some insight to what I am doing and become more comfortable with it.

      Well here I am at Fermi Lab at 1:10 in the AM. My office is in the sub-sub basement...yes that's three stories beneath the ground. I am about 20 feet away from the D0 detector, which I know sounds cool....but really it's just a wall which I know the detector sits behind. Not only am I lucky enough to be below three levels of sunshine, my desk is in a huge cavern. So imagine a huge room with 3 story ceilings and then some desks thrown in the middle. Yowza! does it get better than this!   Anyways, looking at my schedule for the next week I have just planned to not sleep for many days. Jason and I are working these owl shifts this week and so our schedule is all screwed up. It's alright for now, but the end of the week brings meetings that are unfortunatly not at 3am.   That's all for now. i will try and add some photos off my lovely office space in the upcoming week.

      What is the  definition of marriage?  Such a simple looking question but lately in this country is has gotten more and more complicated. Recently Massachusetts has allowed gay couples to marry. Listening to a morning radio show the other day which was discussing said topic, I was surprised by what many of  the  callers had to say. Their thought was that hey, I don't mind it, but you can't call it marriage because "God said marriage is between a man and a woman". But it's ok if it's a civil union. So my question to these people is what about all the straight people that get married a Justice of the Peace? Like me for example. For the rest of my life, should I refer to my future husband as my civil partner? If we are at a party will I give the following introduction, "Hi, my name is Leah and this is my civil partner Jason" ? Since we are not getting married in the church and are obviously beyond sinners by these peoples standards do they say the same thing about us as they would a gay couple?   My real question is...Now it's a good one :  HOW DOES IT AFFECT YOUR LIFE?  Seriously, how does the marriage of two men or two women do anything to you, your family, your children, your marriage etc?   I think that everyone in this country has a right to get married. And by married I mean married, not civil unioned.

      I just moved out to Fermi Lab a couple of days ago. My fiance and I are living in my dad's house for free this summer to save some money. However, come October we will back in the great city of Chicago. After a rather frustrating conversation at the Lab yesterday I got to thinking about why more of the grad students don't live in the city. Obviously there are a lot of issues to consider...money, commuting which of course involves traffic, city noise? Well I could go on and on and maybe my view is biased by the fact that I grew up in Chicago a couple of blocks from Wrigley Field so I can appreciate what the city can offer. I agree that it will be more expensive to live in the city due to higher rents, gas money food and so on. However, at the end of th day and on the weekends I get to say, "But wait, I'm in the city." The city has so much to offer. The city holds me in awe all by itself. I don't need to do anything to enjoy it, just being there calms me down. Then you add to that the amount of things to do, all the museums, bars, clubs, beaches, ball games, starbucks...wait those are everywhere. My point is that spending the bit of extra money and dealing with commuting traffic pale in comparison to just being there and having all the culture and excitement right outside your door.

      My dad is a physics teacher in what used to be one of the best high school science programs in the state. He has gone to work there every day for the past twenty years and for him it wasn't a "job". He got to go to school everyday and work with kids on expanding their physics horizons. Along with the rest of the science faculty they have written grants to get free computers for the classrooms, written the text for the courses they teach because they know what is necessary to get the kids to learn, involved both kids and their parents with outside of school activities like an astronomy night, a giant maze that they built in the wall of the building. He gets into the building usually about 6am or so and doesn't leave until 5 or 6 pm. I write about my dad because he is the faculty member that I know the best....However, the rest of the faculty follows this same behavior.  Due to a new administration this science department has been beaten into the ground and dismantled...In literally less than a years time. One of the faculty members has been transferred to another school in the district without given reason. Not just any teacher, one of the best physics teachers in the department (after my dad of course). This teacher has done so so much for the kids in the school, and so I don't understand why the school would want to get rid of him because of what looks to be someone's personal agenda. Along with this teacher being transferred the faculty has proposed to add another course to the curriculum due to a change in requirements. They offered to develop it, write the needed texts and make what they know will work best for the kids that would be needing this course. The administration said no. Even though 100% of the teachers that would be teaching this course think that it is the best thing for the students. I guess the students get the shaft again. Good job administrators.  I recently attended a board meeting for the school and the other two schools in the district and was shocked to see what actually happens at a school board meeting. After about forty five minutes of students and teachers giving speeches about the teacher that is being moved, many of the speeches very moving and highlighting the behavior of the administration, the meeting just went on to Action Item #2. I was so appalled because I felt that the comments of the students and teachers deserved something more than moving onto the next item of the agenda. The meeting then went on to discuss apparently more important topics involving education, like the price of parking for thirty minutes and the type of food that will be offered at the schools for another twenty minutes.   At NO time did this board discuss education. So I ask, what's the point.   This recent development in the science department is the most childish thing I have ever seen. It's like being in grade school and having to separate the kids that don't get along, or putting a kid in the hallway. The administration will say, well you don't really understand what's happening. So explain it. Tell the department why things are happening, and don't give them some bullshit reason, these are not stupid people. Tell them why you don't want to them to develop a new course, why you think that this would be a bad idea...Instead of just saying, "no."  So to the administration of school: GET OVER IT. Stop being vindictive and let the teachers do what they do best : TEACH. The like to do it, they like to help the kids learn, they enjoy it. But like my dad has said, they don't have to. They could come in everyday from 8am - 3pm, stand at the board and lecture to kids out of a textbook, which is the direction that this department is heading. As leaders of educators, do you want to lose the education part? If so, you are doing a great job and keep up your behavior. If not, Back off.
