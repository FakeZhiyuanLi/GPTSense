      I just got done talking to my friend GD.  He's awesome I can talk to him about anything. I was telling him about how bad I felt about liking both NG and MK.  And that I don't really like myself for being in this situation.  And I know it's early so I don't want to have to make a decision I wish I had made a wiser decision last Tuesday BEFORE I went home with NG.  I kinda feel like he is trying to get me to make a decision about one of these guys.  I just can't do that.  NG is here.  MK is not.  DM is not.  Right now I don't know what I'd make the decision on. I mean it wouldn't be hard to lose DM.  I'm alread annoyed by him, but the other two??

      Well, I don't really have anything that good to write about today.  NG and I went out after work last night.  We met up with some of my friends and had sushi, (his first time).  He liked it so that's good.  We sit through dinner and are waiting for the server to bring us the check when MK calls.  I tell him I'm at dinner and can I call him later.  He asks me to call him around 11:00.  That's when he'll be on his break.  (he works 6:00pm to 6:00am) And I tell him I'll do that.    NG came back to my house after dinner and we try to find Zoolander so I can buy it.  And he has never seen it.  Well, on the way back to my house, NG was following me in his car, I called MK and leave a message that I prolly wouldn't be able to call him at 11:00 (NG may still be at my place) but I tell him to call me tomorrow at work and let me know what's going on for the weekend.  Had a great time with NG watching movies, cuddling on the couch, making out, getting oral (no reciprocation) still no sex though.  I'm not sure if that's a good thing or not because after oral and I'm all ready to go, it's kinda disappointing.  But I think he is trying to be a gentleman.  Or maybe at least wait until we've been out more than twice?!?  Is that how dating works??  I'm not really used to that.  haha  Was late for work this morning. Very late. Don't think that my boss really noticed though.  I got in at about 11:30... oooh, just in time for lunch.  On the way in MK called me and said he just tried my office.  Oops yeah, I'm not there yet.  "you hung over"  ummm, not quite.  "just couldn't seem to get myself out of bed this morning."  Then MK asks me to be is date to a dinner party tonight.  (Which luckily didn't work out.)  But I'll be seeing him tomorrow at my parents' house.  Then coming back Monday to go to a concert with NG.     I actually feel bad because I'm really starting to like NG.  And the one time I did hang out with MK I really liked him too.  And I still have DM to worry about.  I have white water rafting and concert plans with him for the end of June already.

      I know, I know.  This is going to be pretty boring who wants to know what I talk about with these guys on the phone but...  Yesterday after work I gave my work-hook-up buddy, MA, a ride back to his house.  And along the way I told him that he should just get stuff and come back to my house with me.  I was a little disappointed because he couldn't he had some computer programs to write last night, but said if I'd have given him a little more notice....   Come On, like I have notice to give.  So I ended up back at my place by myself which was fine.  MK called me and told me some cracked out stories about his antics at parties with my brother.  Like they would be playing beer pong and he would just pull his dick out continue to play and wait for everyone to notice.  And then one of the guys would smack it and then he would put it away.  Ew!  I told him to never tell me stories like that again.  But he continued with more stories about him and his roommates shaving their pubes and comparing.  Hellooooo...are you trying to gross me out or get me in bed??  Then NG called me as if he knew I just got off the phone with MK.  We are hanging out on Wednesday and watching movies.  So stay tuned for the story about that on Thursday.  NG told me that his one friend told him to watch out for me.  That I could be playing him or something.  Who???  Me???  No seriously, I really do like him I just like other people too.  Then he told me some cracked out stories about his past girlfriends trying to overdose on pain killers and cut herself when he tried to break up with her.  How do you get involved with these crazies???

      What a weekend.  I went on two first dates.  I guess you could call Friday night a first date.  I went out with NG for dinner and drinks.  I met some of his friends. It was really great time.  Luckily it didn't end like our first encounter (me going home with him)  But we ended up making out in the street where my car was parked.  Lots of people driving by honking.  I just don't get it...  Saturday I was just doing normal beautiful Saturday things, laying out etc.  NG called me around 11:00 and told me that I left my umbrella in his car.  And that maybe he would go to the baseball game too and wave at me.  He knew I was going the the game with MK and I don't know perhaps he was a little jealous.  MK called at about 3:30 cause he was about an hour away.  (yeah, he really drove 3 hours to meet me) when he got to my place I was surprised.  He got out of the car and gave me a big hug.  He's so cute.  And we hung out at my house for a little while. We met up with my friends who we were going to the game with at a restaraunt and had some drinks.  Continued drinking for the rest of the night.  Drank too much.  When MK brought me home he came in for a little bit.  And decided that he was going to put me to bed before he left.  (Some how this seems okay even though it is our first date) So he took me to my room and took off my clothes, covered me up. But then I had to walk him out anyway so I could lock the door behind him.  We ended up kissing he ended up giving me oral and I ended the night (after he left) with my vibrator.  Sorry, it was good, but sometimes I'm just a little too nervous for things like that after the first date.     Yesterday MK came over around 10:00 he was on his way back home.  We just hung out on the couch but he said he would come see me next Friday.  (I'll be in the area that he lives in)  Oh and DM called me yesterday too.  It just never seems like we have anything to talk about.  got off the line with him asap.  He's sweet, a great guy.  To bad I don't really care too much about him

      (5-21-2004)  I'm not exactly sure how I get myself into these situations.  I guess I should mention the situation.  I have a few.  The most recent being the after retirement party trip to the bar on Tuesday.  Where I proceeded to drink a little (or a lot) too much and went home this a guy, I'll call him NG. This is only sort of a problem because NG works in the office RIGHT beside mine.  (and he just happened right now to stick his head in my office to say hi)    We had the I-hope-we-are-on-the-same-page-about-what-happened talk yesterday.  I guess because he asked me out tonight and wanted to make sure I didn't feel obligated to go out with him just because we hooked up when we were drunk.   I'm not really one to decline an invitation for dinner or anything where people are going to pay for things for me.  (And he is a damn good kisser) so why not???  Now, tomorrow I have this sort of blind date with this guy, MK, who is friends with my brother (and lives 3-4 hours away).  MK, is coming here to visit his sister who is moving here for the summer.  My brother says that he talks about me a lot (even though we have never met).  What am I getting myself into?  But my brother is friends with him so he can't be that weird.    Besides NG and MK I've also been seeing DM.  DM is a sweetheart that I've dated before while I was in college but, I've known him since 2nd grade.  I already have summer plans with him, like going white water rafting and to come concerts.  So, if things with MK or NG work out... I'm going to have to be able to juggle.

      I told NG about my seeing other people yesterday.  You idiot, right?  Not in the least.  I'm so glad that I talked to him about it.  It really makes me feel so much better.  It maybe didn't make him feel the greatest but at least now he knows that I don't want to see anyone else.  I really like him a lot just I just needed a verbal commitment to him.  I mean, I already have an emotional commitment.  Telling him just solidifies it in my head  So I guess that's the end of all the craziness.  No more multiple men to write about.  I guess from now on I'll have to write about how our relationship is going.  I'm so looking forward to it too.  It's kinda silly. I mean, I really wasn't looking for any of this to happen.  And to become so attached to someone so fast.  Stupid me.  But I really think that things will work out.    I met his parents last week.  And NG told me yesterday that his mom told him that she really liked me.  (NG thought that was surprising b/c she usually doesn't like any of his girlfriends)  I invited him to my brother's wedding.  It's in Aug so I hope he'll have a chance to come to my parents house before that so he can meet some people who will be there.  My family is nuts so...at least he'll know what he's in for.    I guess that's about all there is for now.  not a great story.  Actually a pretty sappy one, to bad!  I'm a happy girl  :)

      Okay, so here's the phone call story.  Apparently I drunk dialed the ex on Friday night.  I'm not sure when I did that b/c I was with people the whole time... But he called me during the day on Saturday and told me that I called.  Whatever, I believe him, why would he make that up?    But he also was wondering why I don't want to talk to him any more and that a few months ago he thought everything was cool with us.  Which, is true everything WAS cool with us.  Until I realized that what I thought was a friendship was actually more like a support group.  I was around when something was wrong with him and I'm supposed to listen and make him feel better.  Friendships are supposed to be symbiotic relationships.  And somehow I never got anything out of our "friendship" except a little heartache.  I realized this especially after not talking to him for weeks and weeks at a time, then he gets in touch with me when he wants something.(As described in a previous post)   Then I think back to the times when he would call me.  It would be after his girlfriend made him feel bad for the number of people he slept with. (and I would ask him if he'd take any of them back, and tell him it's those people and those experiences that shape a lot of who you are)  Or he'd call when he felt like she didn't want him around. I could continue but for the ex's sake I will refrain.  But I realized it was always when he needed some kind of support from me.  It was definitely an eye opener.    So, WF, I hope this explains to you and your friends (who call me to tell me how dumb I am for disliking you), why it is that I don't feel the need to talk to you anymore.  I'm just growing out of our parasitic friendship.  I truly wish you all the best.  And I'm looking forward to all the comments and phone calls I'll be receiving about this post.

      Aye, aye, aye.  Just the title leads you to think there was probably a little drinking going on perhaps even some intoxication.  If you DO think that, you are absolutely right.  My friend KP and I had these plans of meeting my parents at their house on Friday staying there then going to Harrisburg for the Troegs Brew Fest.  It really was a great juicy weekend. So... here it goes.    MK hooked up with my sis.  Literally.  Don't know what happened completely But I know he was in her room for a good chunk of the night.  How do I know this?  I was in the basement asleep on the futon with CJ.  Now, now, who is this CJ?  If you are thinking that it's a different one of my brother's friends you are correct.  I had only met CJ once before and on this second meeting we didn't talk very much at all as we were drinking and playing asshole.  But, he has a cocky sort of attitude which I liked about him.  We all (CJ, MK, KP, TS (my brothers fiancee), my brother, my sister and I) went night swimming after a few games of asshole and almost a case or two of beers.  After swimming my sister and MK stayed outside... For a WHILE.  Inside I pull out the futon and go upstairs to get sheets and blankets to make CJ's bed up. He tells me to go put on dry clothes then I can come back down and work out his kinks.  Like he is going to ALLOW me to do that.  I acted all offended but went and put on my sleeping attire.  After the massage we were talking about religion and I guess he's pretty serious about being catholic.  A whole conversation ensues which ends with a kiss.  And then kissing.  And then sleeping.  I wake up and it's 6:00.  Whoa! The fam's going to be up soon.  So I go up to my bed where KP and I were supposed to be sleeping the whole time.  When I get up I see MK sleeping on the floor.  (Wonder when he came down, haha, oh well).  I told him to climb in bed with CJ and I'm off .  I sleep in my own bed for about an hour.  When the folks wake up and my bro come down stairs the ponder where MK is asleep.  (I pretend not to know, of course)    I honestly think it's better this way b/c I wasn't feelin' him so much.  My sister knew that.  I told her the weekend before.  That is he wasn't as cute as he is that I prolly wouldn't talk to him.  Superficial, I know.  But there was one thing that I did like about him.  How open he was about sex.  I mean, I've never been with a guy who would just talk about it like that and it was really refreshing.  (especially since I think NG is a little on the shy side when it comes to sex)  He sometimes talks about wanting to jump on me.  And I say I wouldn't mind, then, he gets up.  But I digress.  Beer festival time.  I'm a little unsure about what's going to happen.  I mean how is MK going to act? How is CJ going to act?  How am I supposed to act????  The day time was fine the guys were playing golf the whole AM so I didn't have to deal with that.  By the time they got back it was about time to head to Harrisburg. (there is a little phone call missing in here but that's a whole different story).  I seriously had such a great time at the beer fest.  MK was super cool I got to hang out with CJ more TS and KP and Mom and I were chilling.  Everyone was drunk.  I remember CJ and I walking around and my Dad was like, "huh?  You guys?  What?"  He pretended that he was mad.  Somehow CJ and I got separated from the rest of the crew.  That was around 8:30 when they stopped serving.  And We ended up back at the hotel by ourselves.  Went to the room we were making out.  And almost came to sex. It didn't though and I'm so glad!  CJ was like are you sure you want to do this...And I said no I'm not sure.  And we stopped making out talked more kissed more.  The rest of the guys came back then MK decided he wanted to leave (don't know why) I tried to talk him in to staying.  And he said "stop talking to me. Why don't you go fuck [CJ] again."  Angry much?  Sorry, buddy, you fucked up first.   Um so then CJ talked him into staying.  Which is good.  All was well in Harrisburg.    All is well in Pittsburgh too.  NG came over last night.  He looked amazing when I saw him.  I really missed him.  But in the back of my mind I'm thinking about CJ too.  I don't want to mess things up with NG because of CJ.  But I also don't want to miss out on getting to know CJ better because I'm seeing NG.  What to do....

      I haven't written for a little while I guess because there isn't really anything new going on.  Things with NG are still really amazing. He is seriously so great.  We kiss and never stop kissing.  I kinda wish that most times that that happens we'd end up in the bedroom.  I hinted at wanting to have more sex.  (I said something about "doing this at least...three times a day)  He said that might be do-able or something to that extent, but still once at night.  And still haven't had AM or daylight sex at all.  Ummm, we kiss in the morning, and we are already naked from the night before.  Really it wouldn't be that difficult. I'm just concerned b/c if we don't have lots of sex now...Down the road won't it die down or something??  I'll see MK tonight.  I called him last night on my way home from NG's house.  (around 7:00)  He usually starts work at 6:00pm and has his first break at 8:00.  So when he called back at 8:00 I wasn't surprised. He said he was so happy when he saw that I called.  I'm a little concerned about he because he really is quite attractive.  The other day when I was talking to him he said something about moving out here (to Pittsburgh)in January to take classes at CCAC play on the golf team there and get his grades up before transferring to a professional Golf Management Program.  Um...Is it weird that he might move here? I bet if we stopped talking he wouldn't want to move out here anymore.  Although, I don't know.  He's always asking me to be his girlfriend.  (He says, "Will you be my girlfriend?"  and if I say "yes" He says, "That means that I won't see anyone else and you won't see anyone else."  Hello.  I don't see you but once a month.  I don't think THAT's going to work out.  DM called me the other day too.  I haven't called him back yet. I'll call him back next week.  After the beer fest.  MK will cause enough drama for one weekend I think.  I'll see DM next weekend.  Rafting and Concerting.  Yikes why did I EVER invite him months ago?

      OOOOooo.  This may not be that interesting to some.  But for me...a first.  I got two phone calls from MK yesterday.  I was grocery shopping when he called the first time.  We talked a while.  He's a golfer and he was on his way to the driving range.   Then later around 2:00am (for some reason I was awake) he called again.  He does have this tendency to call me when he's been drinking.  Actually he can't stop calling people after he's been drinking, I've experienced that first hand.  Anyway, We talked for a while and he started talking about when he came to Pittsburgh and how turned on he was by my body when he took off my clothes to put me to bed.  (see "first dates" for details)  Then he said he masturbated about that yesterday and was hard again just thinking about it.    Meanwhile...He's in the parking lot at Burger King.  Let's keep that in mind.  Well, I told him that I had masturbated earlier. Then he suggested phone sex.  I told him I wasn't sure about that I've never done it I wasn't sure that I'd be able to say anything.  He's so open about sex it's really refreshing.  He told me I didn't have to say anything he'd do all the talking.  All I had to do was touch myself and make noise.  I'm a pretty good noise maker, and there was no stopping him.  He just started telling me about kissing my nipples and making his way down to my legs, the circular motions he would make with his tongue on my clit.  Some how that stopped long enough for me to say something about my vibrator and he asked what it was like what color and told me to use it.  ahhh.  I love my vibrator.    He kept on talking.  "I'm moving my tongue back and forth, up and down on your clit.  I put my finger inside you.  You feel so good.  God, I want you."  I'm doing really well. And I can hear him start moaning.  Wow.  Phone sex is way better than masturbating by myself.    He goes, I go.  Then he asks how I'm doing.  If I'm good; if I'm tired and ready for bed.  All this in the Burger King parking lot.  Can't say as I mind. Especially with NG's latest episode of going soft on me.  It's nice to know that just thinking about me can do it for someone.  Now I really can't wait to see him next Friday.  He was SO sweet afterward to saying he wishes he could be here to cuddle with me and hold me in his arms until I fell asleep.  He really is super sweet when he wants to be.  What does the future hold?

      I had such a great weekend.  Really.  Friday after work NG and I went to the Phipps conservatory and botanical gardens and walked around and saw the flowers.  They have this beautiful butterfly room where the butterflies are just everywhere, and this other room with these amazing orchids.  I cannot decide which is my favorite.  After that I went home before I met some other co-workers out.  NG, was going to be there too.  I was a little nervous about going out with work people because of my relationship with NG.  I wasn't sure how to act.  Well, because usually when we are together we can't really keep our hands off each other.  It's disgusting but true.  Anyway, it was fine, and I went home by myself.  Yeah, I was pretty impressed with myself.  Saturday I went out with my girlfriends but NG was going to meet me out.  He was out with his friends too.  But came down in time to hang out with me for a little and I went back to his house that night.  What's crazy is I don't remember what sex with him is like and I sleep with him often enough that I should remember.  And we never have morning sex, which I'm mad about cause I LOVE sex in the morning.    Yesterday I helped NG work on his bathroom, we primed the walls since he basically gutted the whole thing when he moved in.  He suggested that I keep some clothes at his house and even gave me space in his closet.  Whoa, kinda a big deal, I know.  Then we went to my house cause I needed to change my clothes.  We were going to go to this free concert.  But we started kissing and I suggested we get naked.  But then... Nothing. ummm, it went down... and never came back.  Hello?  Is there some kind of bug going around?  He said that for some reason he was nervous with me.  What?  Why?  Can you only fuck me in the dark?  I'm a little jilted.  I was seriously all into it.  Did I mention I also love daytime sex?  MK keeps calling me and  I don't know what to do about that.  I know I'm going to see him next weekend so I can't just not talk to him.  I don't really know what's going to happen next weekend at the beer fest.  But NG and I have not had any "exclusivity" conversations. So whatever happens...

      OOOh,  I'm just so mad at myself for liking NG so much.  This wasn't supposed to happen.  Hello, we work together.  Hello, I'm supposed to be running around with many men at this point.  What ever happened to talking to MK and DM and MA?  I mean of course I still talk to them.  But I don't really want to hang out with them  MA, the other work guy that I would occasionally hook up with, and I haven't even hung out in a few weeks.    DM just got back from Florida on Monday and he called me Wednesday.  I stupidly said something about the beer fest that I'm going to in two weeks.  I had already mentioned going over a month ago.  So then felt I bad about not saying anything, so I said something like "Are you going to that?"  And he said "well I will if you want me too."  Ew!  What am I?? Your boss???  I don't think I should have asked about it. That parolee would have given him a hint.  Just talking to him is like pulling teeth.  We seriously have nothing to talk about.  I can't stand it.  I'm pretty much done with that business.  I think I'm just going to avoid his calls until after the beer fest.  And what about rafting?  What a disaster it was to invite him so early, ugh.    Last night I went out with NG we went for dinner and met up with some of his friends for margs.  Ended up at his place (of course) The sex was better, longer, but still too short for my liking.  Then he gave me oral after.  I should tell him to give me oral before then I won't care if it's short, and I'll prolly be able to go again.  He has cats.  When I woke up in the am the one was curled up next to me in bed.  It was the cutest.  NG says that she must really like me.  Which I think is darling.

      EW!  I hate my ex, WF, I seriously can't stand him.  It took me a long time to get over him.  And now that I am, and have just recently started dating other people he wants to pop back up.  Well I just don't want to talk to him anymore.    WF instant messages me and asks me to do things for him.  Look this person up, see if that person is around.  OR he'll brag about how is lab bought his this or that (like new computers) and want me to check out the specs on it.  Hullo, brag a little more please, why do I care to hear about that.  But I haven't actually spoken to him in months.  And just recently he decided that I still care about what he's doing so he started  with the IM's  But yesterday I told WF to stop talking to me if all he was going to do was ask me to do things for him.  And what does he do???  Calls me at 1:00am "Just to say hi.  Not because he wants anything.  Just to say hi."  Thank god I didn't answer my phone.  What a dick.

      I had sex last night.  yep, no beating around the bush with that one.   It's been a while so I was really excited when NG stopped kissing me and reached for the bed side drawer with the comment "these things are horrible but necessary"  I thought that was going to be the culmination of a wonderful night. Well.... It really wasn't seeing as how it lasted about a minute.  I'm not even exaggerating.  It was "eh".  But he totally redeemed himself by going down on me afterwards.  Obviously he knew.  Perhaps he hasn't had sex in a long time, I dunno.  I hope it's not always so boring.  No moving around, straight missionary for a whopping minute.  Maybe I'm just that good.   I know it's crazy but I actually missed NG while I was at my parents.  I was really looking forward to the Rush concert and seeing him.  Honestly the whole evening was yet again tons of fun.  I just love being around NG.  I mean, I always have a good time with him and he is so nice.    So he picks me up and we go to the concert where we are meeting a few of his friends.  We cooked out at drank at his car.  Good times.  I had so much fun at the concert with NG.  And I slept at his house (obviously, cause of the sex).  Weird thing about that is...We go into work together.  Walk down the same hallway, and go to adjacent offices.  Wow.  Weird.

      Phew, I sure am glad the weekend is over.  It was a long one.  I went to my parents house for the weekend on Friday.  They live about three hours away.  MK was coming there Friday night to see my brother and me I guess.  I'm not sure what happened between the weekend when he was here visiting me in Pittsburgh and Friday, but he acted a lot different.  MK and my brother drank a lot and we were all (my brother, his fiancee,TS, MK and me) hanging out at the bar (in my basement) the guys decided that they wanted to go to Denny's.  On the way and while we were there MK was saying all this really inappropriate (untrue) stuff about what happened while he was here. He actually said "I know you think I don't like cats, but I really like your pussy"   Ew!  Who says that?  He said lots of other shit too while we were eating. And he just kept calling people..."Who can we call now?"  He was just so different.  I don't know.   I think that I really wanted him to piss me off while he was there b/c I felt really bad like I was cheating on NG or somehow doing something wrong by being with MK.  Well.  That feeling sort of passed when we got back to my house after Denny's I was planning on sleeping on the couch.  My bed was unavailable.  My brother and TS went up to bed, MK wanted to lay on the couch and cuddle with me.  We got to talking and then kissing.  He kept telling me that I'd never have to go down on him cause he just doesn't really like it that much.  But he said he would go down on me any time I want.  (Doesn't sound like a bad deal)  Then it's 2:00am and he wants to go out to the pool...Swimming I'm sure.  That didn't happen.  He kept talking about putting it in my butt.  Not such a fun thing...Been there.  But we fell asleep on the couch for a few minutes.  I was all wrapped up in his arms.  Some how we woke up and he went downstairs to the futon.  It's 4:00am now and he called me from the basement to tell me that he missed me.  Oh yeah and I forgot while we were talking and kissing.  He told me that he loved me.  Not just once.  Like four times!!!  Helllooooo.... You met me 5 days ago!!!  Granted he was drunk and trying to get me to fuck him in the pool.  So that's why I excuse that.  I'm really thinking this isn't going to work out.  Darn shame though he's an excellent kisser and pretty good at giving me head.  We'll see what happens at the Brewer's Fest in two weeks.
