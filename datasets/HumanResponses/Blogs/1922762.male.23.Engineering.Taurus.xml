       Today is the second day of the Petrol Pump strike in Calcutta  and the one in Mumbai just started early this morning. When I  think about these cities I can't imagine the state of living with no transport (public or private) & other basic amenities  It gives me shivers to think as to what would happen to B'lore if there is no petrol available for days together. How shall people come to office? Even if they do, how shall the  generators work if there is no diesel? (assuming that the electricity is also dead) On top of that, if the water department calls it off, I get goosed up to imagine how filthy life would become.  Its nice that the weather system in Bangalore is pleasant and one does not sweat as bad as one does in Calcutta or Mumbai but I am sure that without the basic amenities, life would becomes one  big hell.  -+-

       There has always been one thing which I have wanted to do and  that is to make a game like Quake. Guess what, I even started  looking into tools like SDL, OpenGL and even made a simple game Snood 21 but then I could never complete it which is something  I really hate of myself.   I can understand why I tend to jump from one state of mind to  another without even trying to finish what I started. If I look back now there are so many unfinished things in my life that even if I start back to finish all of those, I don't know when I  would be done with them.  So, my tryst with finding out that one thing still continues. I need to keep working, keep studying and keep myself busy until  I don't find it out.

       I was completely taken aback the other day when I had to cut a  blank face to the question that Kalpana asked me, "Sunny, what's your goal?"  Its been some time now since I thought about my future and I  wonder why I haven't been thinking about it lately. Is it because I am happy with what I am doing or because I am very busy to think about other things or is it due to the fact that I am a married man with a lot of responsibilities and blah blah blah ..  That certainly does not stop anyone from pursuing what one wants to do in this life. But, if I ask myself the question as to what do I ultimately want to pursue as that one thing which I would always love to do, I just don't know .. its like I still don't know what I would like to do for the rest of my life. I am  completely confused.  Well, my mind is never stable. I am always in the jumping state  and I hop from one state of mind to another faster than the speed  of light (now that's a stupid analogy). I guess I need to improve my concentration, which as I look at it now, is very poor. I need to improve my focus in life and try to find out that one thing  which I would love to do and find it fast.  Until then,   -+-

       If you are a fan of Kashmiri food and would do anything to have the delicacies at home, well you just have to click the mouse button, as  urlLink http://koshursaal.tripod.com/  is that one place where you would find all the recipes for all the delights.  Well, you just need to follow the instructions and you are there. Guess what, once you would have made a couple of dishes you would realize that its pretty easy. Don't worry if you get confused by the name of the spices, there is a glossary at the end to help you out.  So, if you are doing nothing this weekend how about a "Koshur Saal"  -+-

       Its been a long time since I have written on this blog. Since the time blogger was blocked by the folks in the IS, blogging has not been that easy until one day Sarode told me about other ways of doing the same.  So I guess I am back again.  Well, many things happened since I last wrote here. The house chase is going no where, Kalpana and I met with an accident and some other plans about life in general. On the whole, life has been very slow at times and remarkably fast at others.  More than other things, I started sketching again .. but its been some time now since I last sketched. I guess its time to give my pencils some action again :)  Kalpana got her VISA and I would be applying for mine soon. I don't know if I would be able to leave with her but then its always good to be on the safer side.  Apart from other things, I realized that I waste my time a lot and that I need to do something good with it.  More later.

       This is how the blog would look if I change the font. As far as the newline is concerned, let me enter some junk and see how this is being taken care of in the index. So, this is the start of the junk and now I am entering a newline.  This is the newline  Bingo

       Talk about 'corruption' and you can find it written all over in any Indian Office.  This time though I had a taste of it at the office of the registrar where I had to pay a visit to get my marriage registered.   The deal  The deal was simple. One fine day, I went to this office to enquire about the things which need to be attached with the registration form and I was not amazed to find a person being too polite to me. He was even kind enough to come all the way down to the shop where I paid 30 bucks for the registration form.  Next week, while Kalpana and I were leaving to get this job done I asked her to carry an extra bit of cash as we might find it handy. Needless to say, she was already ready with it in the anticipation of what was coming our way.  On reaching that place, I was asked to see this *Madam* on the first floor who would be helping  me out with the next level of proceedings. She was also very kind and at that time I had a  feeling that this endeavor is going to cost me a fortune.   Not to my surprise, the *Madam* asked the same old chap, who I found the other day, to  accompany me towards the ground floor where I was supposed to pay the *official* sum of  15/- bucks. While I was coming back, he asked Kalpana to take a seat, thinking the 'poor girl' need not know what's going to happen next. Well, I must say that was a  blessing in disguise for her. She was already tired pushing one corner to another with  me and I could see that she was more than happy to take the seat.   Climax  While in the middle of the staircase, the chap told me. "Look sir, when do you want  to get this done. I understand this is Urgent, Right!", putting a little more emphasis on the 'Right'. I knew what was coming and I did not want to get into any verbal disputation, so I placed the 150 bucks I had in my hand quietly into his. Needless to say, I was a way too nervous as this was the first time I was doing anything like this. I assumed the story would have an happy ending here but something he said drove me out of the imagination-loop. "Kitna Hain (How much is it)?". "150", I shot back. "Well, Madam  ko bhi dena hain .. who manegi nahi (you need to give some to Madam otherwise she  won't agree). No need to mention as to what I did next.  So there I was, in front of *Madam*, with the registration form and other stuff in my hand and the money tucked under them all. I was so nervous that I just did not know what to do.  *Madam* stared at me for sometime and then started to look into the case of another couple. Then she asked another person to look into my matter which indirectly meant that I had to give the money to the new guy. What a network!  Nervous I was, I did not move, did not even say anything. The new guy waited for sometime and I feel he understood that I was new in this trade. He told me in front of  everyone, "You have to give a fee, Sir". There you go! I handed him the cash in front of all told him that I wanted to take the certificate by evening and bingo! my job was done.   After thought  If you look at it now, there are approximately 5 people coming every hour for getting  the registration done. So assuming that Madam works for her full quota of 6 hours, she can expect 5 * 6 * 200 = 6000 bucks everyday. Lets assume she donates 50% of that to the other shit heads, she still earns a healthy sum of ~90,000 untaxable income per month.   What does the Govt Loose?  The rule is that with every marriage registration an NSC for 2000 bucks from a post office needs to be purchased by the couple. So, going by the same logic, 30 registrations per day would have given the Govt a revenue of 2000 * 30 registration  = 18 Lakhs per month. As this is just a small office, 200 to 300 bucks per registration is peanuts. I fail to imagine the stakes involved in the big *Page 1* scams!  Well, I never wanted to get involved into all this and by paying a 'fee' I count myself as a criminal too but then do you think with a system where corruption creeps in from the lowest level of authority, I would have wanted to wait for the next 'n' number of years just to prove to the authorities, which happen to be the same kind of people, that I  have married Kalpana Palaniswamy!!  I feel that's a waste.  Anyhow, God bless *Madam*!!

        Finally, the name changes   From sometime, I was thinking of renaming this blog from the exanimate title "Piyush Garyali's Weblog" to something else. When I finally could not think of anything else even after giving it so much thought, I thought  T h o u g h t s ...   would look like a title I was thinking about.   So hereafter  urlLink http://piyushgaryali.blogspot.com  would take you to the 'thoughts' of Piyush Garyali. Gee, I guess I should get back to work now.

       Sometimes I wonder why I still haven't renamed my blog to something like   l'estomac affam&eacute; parle   [The Famished Stomach Speaks] but then I can't help but write about yet another dining-out adventure I got into this Saturday when Kalpana decided that she wanted to have something Punjabi.   Owing to the fact that both of us are pretty bad at our culinary skills and that too coking Punjabi food at home would have been more of an exercise in itself, we decided to hunt for a good place to hog.  As I have mentioned before, hunting for a good place to eat in Bangalore can sometimes become quite annoying. We took the Bangalore Times which has a special section on food on Fridays where the restaurants throw up ADs in the anticipation of the fact that all the IT people in the city would definitely want to move out of their daily boring schedules and dine out on the night of Friday as Saturday happens to be a holiday.  So, Kalpana jumped ahead of me to grab the paper and was pretty fast in finding out about some restaurant by the name "Chandani Chowk" in Koramangla which happens to be 'the' place to have Punjabi food (well according the AD at least). Directions Madame??  "Oh, its on the Koramangla 80 ft road next to Microland ", she said.  Only after reaching Microland and knowing the fact that the 80 ft Road was no where near to this so called landmark, I knew for sure we were lost but still, to try our luck out, we went as far as Asian Sports Village and found nothing. What next?  "Well, now that its getting late and we are hungry too, lets go to the Feast of Asia ", she said, a little disappointed though as I knew she wanted to have something good. (not that Feast of Asia is not good)  So, we started moving back to where we came from and were all set to park our Honda 'Activa' (can't we make that invisible) when I saw something just opposite to Feast of Asia that made my eyes sparkle. No No!! It was not  "Chandani Chowk"  but another Punjabi restaurant called  "Dal Roti" . :)   Dal Roti  At first I thought this place would not be as nice as it turned out to be. Situated on the first floor, just opposite to the Feast of Asia, this place is really 'the' place to go if one is looking for a break from the daily dose of South Indian delicacies. The menu is in English but reads Hindi. So, one can find the name of the dish in pure Punjabi iStyle, "Sarsoon da Saag aur roti" and what more it also serves some Chinese dishes and the section in the menu for those delicacies reads "Chini Chini" .. I thought that was really cute.   So, what did we have? Before I answer that I would like to add that this place serves both vegetarian as well as the other kind. Well, we started with the Veg Clear soup, which was really well made, no additives, no sticky business, plain clear soup with whole bunch of vegetables. To accompany that we went for the "Dandi Veg Kebab", something really delightful, and came as five kebabs rolled on small sticks served with Pundeney ki Chutni.    For the main course we went for Karela Masala (wow!), Rajma and can you believe it, these guys serve you plain atta rotis, the one your mother would make for you. Though they also have the regular variety of breads usually available in any restaurant these days, I would definitely vouch for the plain ones.   Well, the food was tasty (no doubt) and quite in the budget too but then there were so many other things to try out, looks like I would have to pay these guys a visit again :)   Till I find where "Chandani Chowk" actually is, its "Dal Roti" all the way.

       I had been waiting for this movie every since I heard that Farhan Akthar is making a new one. After  Dil Chatha Hain  I had a feeling that there was going to be something different about  Lakshya  as well.   The movie got released in Bangalore on the 18th (Friday) and the first thing I did after getting up on the 19th was to go to  Innovative Multiplex  and book the tickets. Lucky me for when I reached the theatre the tickets were only available for the night show.  The show was at 10:00 in the night. When I reached the theatre with Kalpana, Asif and Chetan (Asif's friend who is studying at IIM-B) I found that they were screening the movie in all four screens. For a while I thought the people at  Innovative multiplex  were damn rich guys to have the courage of buying four prints of the movie. Later, after talking to one of the gate boys, I found that they actually had one print but they would be running it in all four screens. For a while I could not make any sense of out it so I kept bothering him for more details to which he gave me the following explanation. The four screens of the multiplex were at the four corners and hence the central projection area for all the screens was same. So, the reel would be fed to the first projector and then to the second, followed by the third and fourth. This way all the four screens would be showing the same movie with a delay of just about four to five seconds between them. Amazing isn't it. Well, I wondered if this was legal? Anyway, due to the arrangements the movie got deferred by 20 minutes.   About the movie  Lakshya is a movie about the Kargil war but is completely different from the regular "Sunny Deol" stereotypes. Its is all about a boy who is not sure of what he wants to do with his life till is joins the army and ends up becoming a captain at the LOC. The movie is about the transformation of Hrithik from a confused person to a focused individual and the gifted director has handled this change in an outstanding manner. The cinematography is awesome especially the ones at Kargil. One nearly misses a beat in the rock-climbing scene that talks loudly about sheer professionalism. I was literary in tears in the scene where Hrithik talks to his father before going for the mission. This movie is worth the 120 bucks spent and I am going to see it again even if Kalpana sits on my head and bangs it.    urlLink Read more

       At last! The snaps have been uploaded. All these days it was on the back of my mind that I had to upload the photographs but I used to forget it every day. Good that Kalpana chose to do it before it was time to upload the ones for our anniversary :P (bad joke)  Click  urlLink here  to view the Ofoto Album. You might have to Sign In to view the album. The snaps also have the description of all the steps which were taken in the wedding conducted according to Arya Samaj. So viewing the slide show would be interesting.

       More on food. Weekend Shopping!! And this time we went to  The Forum , the new "Mega" Shopping mall at Kormangla. Wedding gifts? Some friends had given gift vouchers for  Landmark  and  Westside , so it was time to redeem them before they would become invalid. Kalpana was busy getting goodies for herself and some cute things for the house. Poor me, she did not buy me anything. Anyhow, once all the shopping was done, it was time to hog and the perfect place for a quick bite was " Transit ", the food court at  The Forum .  This place is awesome, the look and feel gives you an impression as if you are in some Bond movie, the food is not bad either. This time though we had a bite of the Thai food at the " Panda Club ".  Chicken Satay , kind of a Thai version of Chicken Tandoori though the size was a hundred times smaller. I had a Thai combo non-veggie meal while Kalpana went for the Vietnamese Combo veg meal which she did not like one bit. So, I had to swap my plate with her in the anticipation that she does not throw up. What can I say, she has peculiar tastes :) But I had a good time and I really feel the food court is done well, a thousand times better than the one at Kemp Fort.  Highly recommended for a change.

        "Harry Potter 3"  and  "The Day After Tomorrow"  are out in theatres now and I am thinking of plans to convince Kalpana to come with me to the movies. I know it is going to be really tough to make her agree to come for both movies in one weekend, so all I can do is to pray that they continue to be screened till next Saturday. What's worst I can buy her into this by agreeing to go for  "Hum Tum".   Lets see :)

       Talking of places to eat; this one is new. Its called   Manjia  , a Chinese restaurant in JayaNagar on top of the Corner House. The food is extremely pleasing though a little expensive.   It was Saravana's birthday on the 2nd of June and he decided to give a treat today which turned out to be good opportunity to taste the wide variety offered by the restaurant.  So, if you plan to go to this place here are some hints to pick your meal  1) If you are a vegetarian/Non Vegetarian, go for a Hot and Sour vegetable/Chicken soup. It is mind blowing.  2) For starters you can have the Spinach Toast if you are a vegetarian or the threaded Chicken if you happen to be a non-veggie. These are really different and you would not have had anything like this before.  3) For the main course go for Chicken volcano, Mongolian Noddles or Szchewan Egg trapped fried rice; something really new.  4) You can avoid the Combo meals and the vegetable spring roles as they are not worth the money.   How do I reach there?  Simple, If you know the road in Jaya Nagar where Nandani and G K Vale are on your left and Pizza Hut is on your right, keep going straight, cross the junction and you will find the place right at the corner.  Happy weekends

      Believe it or not, but it happened twice in past 12 hours. Power outage in Phoenix. &nbsp; Suddenly, all your electronics gudgets will be ringing alarms or blinking on being reset. Life becomes hell and you helpless. You can't wake up coz your GE radio-cum-watch is hung, even microwave's watch is blacked out, yeah but without AC the heat outside due to rising Sun will not allow you to sleep any longer. Even if you woke up, neither you have cold water in shower nor your fridge and electric stoves are working... that time you appreciate the low-power consumption keyword of "Centrino" from Intel and neighbouring hotel's free wireless connection.  Its an irony that, you are connected to the world thru most latest technology inspite being in miserable condition caused by the habit of&nbsp;living&nbsp;in technological world !!!

      After a long time, atlast my hands clicked "create a new post", and to add to earlier listed reasons of weblogging, this time the motivation is very different. Sat to write my thoughts, or say to capture my&nbsp;ideas to get myself reminded of it in future. Unlike many people, I do not write a diary, instead my thoughts flow thru e-mails, sms, talk, or penning on the last a few pages of nearest found notebook, but the problem with that is its hard to retrieve and that doesn't serve as reminder. Yeah, I have tried outlook "task" mechanism too but that works only in office.... ok, whatever after this background and justification of my log I shall come to the point.  &nbsp;  As told by the title of this blog, sometimes I struggle with myself to get the answers to this question, that how long can we or should we&nbsp;wait to start doing something meaningful for this society? When I say society, its scope varies widely which starts right from the people around me and upto the thought of this whole world as society. Very recently for past couple of months I have extended my current scope to global society. :-) Well, but this idea is not that wide scoped, instead it has a boundary of a village or a town in India, specially not around Bangalore.  &nbsp;  Yeah, so I was thinking of establishing some kind of school level science lab for my village. More specifically, my idea is not to make a school style lab instead to bring up a workshop which has basic scientific principles demonstrated in practical and meaningful ways. It will also have basic machine tools and ofcourse a x86 computer dabba. The ultimate purpose of something like this is to bring-in the awareness of science and nurturing engineering thinking in people right from the beginning and in the way which will be useful to them. Yes, it would be open to all and will have all the motivational fundas those are needed to pull the people inside the structure. There won't be any fee, or may the minimal fee which is generally needed to inculcate discipline. I have no great expectations from this, other than just making people aware of the things what they generally don't see, or get scared to when see in a city.&nbsp;Its like just giving information and once they have information&nbsp;eventually (though with very slow pace) they will start developing interest in it. But, I am not looking forward for some great breakthru or something like this, I just want to create some fumes and lets see how everybody reacts. By now we all have realized the fact that access to infomation is the key to growth and interest, otherwise how each of you started this blog thing, or why anthropologists try to lobby against MTV and other channels like that? When information is available, it takes up some cells in your brain and as the brain&nbsp;does a brute-force search at times, these cells happen to get refreshed and influence the results of queries, and then slowly becomes significant enough to influence your interests and decisions. Pardon me for my own crude explanation of "how brain works", atleast do not tell it to Manik. ;-)  Ok, so now its time to think about the logistics. Well, the first thing I do whenever this kind of idea hits me is to pick the phone and talk to my father and trouble him to go to our village and then talk to people there and then come out with a appealing proposal with cost and feasibility, BUT... this time its not possible, coz I am in different time zone and he should be asleep by now. So, I have sent a mail to me to serve as reminder for taking this thing forward after coming back to Bangalore (ah, one more week).  &nbsp;  Its strange that I get so much of impulse of doing something like this and most probably once I am back to Bangalore, I would be far too busy in other "more important" tasks and all these stays in blog or task lists. There I have to convince my girlfriend to marry me, have to stay in office for long hours (though without much productivity), worry about food and accomodation (as if I do not have those already)&nbsp;and do all the other things those "sound" more important to me. Then I'll think that, let me get settled in life properly then I'll do all this... and the life goes on without reaching to a "settled" frame of mind forever and the wait never ends....  &nbsp;  Will there be any moment in our life which will bring up the priority of this thought above other ever-lasting worries of life? How great we need to be to start doing something for the&nbsp;people who live hundred times below our so called greatness?  &nbsp;  I salute people like, Dr. Devi Shetty, Dr. V J Kurian and Anna Hazare.  &nbsp;

           Today I had enough time to spend some on creating this new weblog. Inspired by Gary and Piyush Sarode, I decided to open my mind in public. Coincedentally, last night i was watching a movie or some series "Ed TV", in it that guy Ed has signed a contract with some TV channel to allow them to live telecast his day-to-day life...and how this whole stuff turns into a nightmare for him and his family.       I was just thinking, isn't this weblog a kind of very initial stage of the same mentality? I am seeing how making personal things public is in trend nowadays, specially in the advanced countries. I will not criticize it, but would try to understand the psychological process behind that.... oh oh yes, you got it right. I have an inclination towards psychology and always try to find a rational behind each and everything happening around me, related to human behavior in particular. You won't believe that I with one of my friend Maneesh spent days in identifying and quantifying the factors affecting human behavior, and as you can imagine very soon we realized that its beyond our scope, and with that realization the modern civilization had to continue without a biggest breakthru in this field. Don't get disappointed its there in my todo list after my retirement. ;-)       Now, lets bring our focus back to the rational(s) behind the weblogging. I am trying to list a few very obvious ones first, with the course of time we'll get many more. 1. To see my name in the website. 2. Get an hit while searching in google. (though it doesn't happen currently) 3. Time pass 4. Displaying love to latest trend 5. Showing off my writing skills 6. Showing off the breadth of knowledge 7. Sharing my thoughts with known friends 8. Nobody listens to me, thatswhy I have to write it somewhere 9. Oh man its boiling inside me, better I flush it otherwise it may burst. 10. This world deserves my opinion to stay in place....  blah blah blah...
