I'M SO TIRED OF BEING HERE  SUPPRESSED BY ALL MY CHILDISH FEARS  AND IF YOU HAVE TO LEAVE  I WISH THAT YOU WOULD JUST LEAVE  CAUSE PRESSENCE STILL LINGERS HERE  AND IT WON'T LEAVE ME ALONE   (CHORUS)  THESE WOUNDS WON'T SEEM HEAL  THIS PAIN IS JUST TO REAL  THERE'S JUST TO MUCH THAT TIME CANNOT ERASE  WHEN YOU CRY  I'D WIPE AWAY ALL OF YOUR TEARS  WHEN YOU SCREAM  I'D FIGHT AWAY ALL OF YOUR FEARS  I HELD YOUR HAND THROUGH ALL OF THESE YEARS  AND YOU STILL HAVE ALL OF ME   YOU USED TO CAPIVATE ME BY YOUR RESSENATING LINES  NOW I'M BOUND BY THE LIFE YOU LEFT BEHIND  YOUR FACE AT ONCE, MY ONCE PLEASENT DREAMS  YOUR VOICE HAS CHASE AWAY ALL THE SANITY IN ME   (CHORUS)   I TRIED SO HARD TO TELL MYSELF  THAT YOUR GONE  BUT THOUGH YOUR STILL WITH ME  I'VE BEEN ALONE  I'M ALONE   WHEN YOU CRY  I'D WIPE AWAY ALL OF YOUR TEARS  WHEN YOU SCREAM  I'D FIGHT AWAY ALL OF YOUR FEARS  I HELD YOU HAND THROUGH ALL OF THESE YEARS  AND YOU STILL STILL HAVE  ALL OF ME   this also a cool song... wanna noe eh? its B.E.P wit shut up...  Shut up Just shut up Shut up (3x) Shut it up, just shut up Shut up Just shut up Shut up (3x) Shut it up, just shut up  [Chorus] We try to take it slow But we're still losin control And we try to make it work But it still isn't the worst And I'm craaazzzy For tryin to be your laaadddy I think I'm goin crazy  Girl, me and you were just fine (you know) We wine and dine Did them things that couples do when in love (you know) Walks on the beach and stuff (you know) Things that lovers say and do I love you boo, I love you too I miss you a lot, I miss you even more That's why I flew you out When we was on tour But then something got out of hand You start yellin when I'm with my friends Even though I had legitimate reasons (bull shit) You know I have to make them evidence (bull shit) How could you trust our private lives girl That's why you don't believe my lies And quit this lecture  [Chorus]  Why does he know she gotta move so fast Love is progress if you could make it last Why is it that you just lose control Every time you agree on takin it slow So why does it got to be so damn tough Cuz fools in lust could never get enough of love Showin him the love that you be givin Changing up your livin For a lovin transistion Girl lip so much she tryin to get you to listen Few mad at each other has become our tradition You yell, I yell, everybody yells Got neighbors across the street sayin “ Who the hell?!?” Who the hell? What the hell's going down? Too much of the bickering Kill it with the sound and  [Chorus]  Girl our love is dyin Why can't you stop tryin I never been a quitah But I do deserve betta Believe me I will do bad Let's forget the past And let's start this new plan Why? Cuz it's the same old routine And then next week I hear them scream Girl I know you're tired of the things they say You're damn right Cuz I heard them lame dame excuses just yesterday That was a different thing No it ain't That was a different thing No it ain't That was a different thing It was the same damn thing Same ass excuses Boy you're usless Whhoooaaaa  [Chorus]  Stop the talking baby Or I start walking baby Is that all there is (repeat)   this is 1 of my favorit song... by a*teens    When I said go  I never meant away  You outta know  That the freaky games we play  Could you forgive and learn how to forget?  Here he is I`m calling out your name   Refrain:  Firefly come back to me  make the night as bright as day,  I`ll be looking out for you  Tell me that you`re lonely too  Firefly come leave me home  Follow you into the sun  That`s the way it outta be  Firefly come back to me.   You and Me  we shared a mystery  we were so close  like honey to the bee  and if you told me how to make you understand  I`m mightier in a major kind of way   Refrain   Fly Firefly through the sky  Come and play with my desire  Don`t be long  don`t ask why  I can`t wait another night  Wait another Night  Fire, Fire, Firefly!   Refrain (repeat)

      FIRST PART 1. Do you feel this would be something you would like to use? no I don’t think so.. I wont have any privacy… 2. Do you think society is ready for technology like this? I guess it would take a while 2 be used 2 the changes… 3. What would be the benefits of this technology? first.. it would be good dat others noes rite away wat u want and secondly, u don’t need to waste time on trying 2 explain 2 others wat u want.. 4. What could become problems with this technology? we wont feel confident goin out.. coz ppl will noe wat u want.. n secondly it can become a troble wen dey hav probs inserting it in u.. 5. What other thoughts or opinions do you have regarding this technology. I tink dat dis typ of technology will b fine 4 som ppl.. but others might just want 2 stay the sam by not taking this technology..  SECOND PART 1. How does the increasing use of cameras affect privacy?  it affectz our privacy coz whatever we do are caught on tape.. 2. Where do you think it is fair to have cameras installed? Not fair? It is fair 2 hav cameras on the streets, buildings, stores, toilets, malls, and etc.. I thinks its sort of ok 2 put it at d parking lots, and market place.. 3. What is your opinion on this subject? dis subject tells a lot about the technology around us.. It also tells me how it had effected our lives... 4. If you feel that this is an invasion of privacy, how do you feel governments should help increase protection from the inclining terrorist threats? I thing dat d governments shud put mor cameras on markets n parking lots. D mor cameras, the saver it will be..
