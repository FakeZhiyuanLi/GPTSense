      I had the opportunity of watching Saturday Night Fever at Istana Budaya last night and I must say, that was some of the best dancing ever seen on a stage, so much like a fever. Of course, I missed the original cast, Adam Garcia, who played the part of Tony Manero - as made famous by John Travolta back in 1977. However, Jon Adam Fiorentino who played Tony Manero was just different, but none the less sensational. And he can dance. The whole team can dance... with such energy and skills. Storyline aside, it's the music, particularly the dancing which became the main reason people were there at IB. And it so fresh, and boogiefying as it was all those years ago when we first saw it in the 1977 movie.  And in between the show, i already found myself giving the show a five star...

        FIAT SAPIENTIA VIRTUS    Manliness Through Wisdom   Kebijaksanaan Mutu Manusia     Wisdom is one of our treasures, and discovering that wisdom helps us to understand the benefits that come with time. We gain knowledge and experience as we grow up in our alma mater, and make more of our natural evolution. We learn to embrace each passing moment, living a life that's true.   We treasure each of these moments as a gift of importance, and at every stage of our lives, we appreciate different things. We evolve with time and see how powerful and exciting this evolution can be.   Perhaps the discovery of such wisdom begins with living consciously and aiming at being our best. So often we think that things just happen. Not so. When we are conscious of our actions, motives, and patterns, we can understand ourselves better, as well as those around us. Only when we take notice of our patterns and motives can we take more positive action in our lives.   We discover our passions that may be the key to unlocking such wisdom. With such passion, we pursue our own happiness which have a direct impact on everyone around us, in all forms: love, friendship, even work, are all directly related to our personal sense of happiness and well-being.   Thus, the wisdom that men need to tap into is something that comes with each passing moment; it's the ability to look back at a lifetime and realise where our strengths and our passions lie.   Perhaps such wisdom all began at a place called The Malay College Kuala Kangsar. Perhaps it's with such wisdom that we all begin to learn to demonstrate such manliness.
