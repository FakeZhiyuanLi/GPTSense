       Site design improvements...  I made a minor change that should help make the link text on the sidebar on the left side of this page easier to read.  If you are having issues with any aspect of the site, feel free to  urlLink drop me a line  with your suggestions.  Thanks!

       Welcome to the Continuum Fanfiction Network, version 2.0!  OK, I think I finally got most of the site working (if not all of it).  Hope you like the new design; it's quite a bit more organized than the previous incarnation (and looks a hell of a lot better, to boot).  A few pages in the  urlLink  A New Legacy   section got slagged in the process, they'll be back when they're actually needed for the story (pilot/squad profiles, the Continuum Challenge section).  That part done, time to finish up Segment I!

       Site update in progress...  The site is undergoing a complete redesign; access to the original pages is possible through the links at the top of this page, but you may have to use the "Back" button on your browser to return to this page.  This issue should only be a problem for the next couple of hours until I have completed updating all pages on the site.

      As anyone who has been following the story has figured out by now (all four or five of you), it's been a while since there's been any sort of progress made on  urlLink  A New Legacy  .  I haven't forgotten about the story, it's simply been sitting on the back burner for a bit due to RL issues (work, and getting ready for a six-month "pleasure cruise" to the Gulf...).  I hope to have something up by mid-week, if I haven't gone insane by then, that is... x_x

      Found this little gem hidden in a corner over at the  urlLink Chaos Zone  website.  This one's been around for a while, and I couldn't resist putting it up here.   urlLink  YKYPTMSSW...   (dang, that's cumbersome) is up in the  urlLink Other Works  section, check it out!

      I've created a new  urlLink subsection  where I can post miscellaneous news, opinions, links, or whatever happens to be on my mind at the time.  On the fanfiction front, work on  urlLink  A New Legacy  , Segment II:  Trial By Fire  is being continued after an extended hiatus.  Look for the opening part sometime in the next week or two.  In the meantime, thanks to everyone who has been posting or sending in their profiles; I'll work on getting them formatted and posted within the next couple days.  Thanks for your support, and here's hoping that the story will go on!

      The answer to that question can be found here (snipped from the description of the photo):  urlLink USS Nimitz (CVN 68) and Carrier Air Wing Eleven (CVW-11) carry out flight operations in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.   Internet access alone is tenuous, without the futile efforts in getting the FTP working to keep anything but the opening page of the site updated.  Therefore, until some solution can be devised, updates to the  urlLink continuum-fics.net  domain (with the exceptions of the Spectator Mode page, and the one you're reading now; these are based on  urlLink Blogger  urlLink  , which only requires HTTP access) are being suspended.  However, don't think that this means work on the story itself is being halted; on the contrary, progress is still being made, though at a somewhat slower pace (given my lack of ability to actually play the game the story is based on).  That all being said, keep having fun, and I'll be back before you know it.

      The war, insofar as the major campaign goes, is more or less over.  [EDIT 5/27/04: If only I could have known just  how wrong I was...]  The majority of the troops are looking forward to packing up and heading home, and the lion's share of the naval force (3 of 4 carriers in the Gulf) have headed back to their respective homeports.  How does this affect both myself and the future of CF.Net?  Well, in all honesty, not very much.  The Nimitz remains on station in the Arabian Gulf, and is likely to  stay  here for the foreseeable future; with only about two months completed of a scheduled deployment, we're unlikely even to consider to pull back into San Diego until very late this year.  That being said, I will continue every effort to continue work on  A New Legacy , as well as another couple of non-SS projects I am working on, and hope to have everything back in working order upon my return to the mainland.  It pains me to have the site gathering cobwebs while I'm away, but there's nothing to be done; hopefully, I will be able to make up for lost time once I get back home.  I've gotta run; keep the game fun, and I'll see you all again in a few months!

      I've been sending out e-mails to folks back home for the last few months; I figure I might as well let the rest of you know what's been going on out here ever since I unceremoniously disappeared.  First off, "here" at the moment is somewhere in the middle of the Arabian Gulf aboard the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz (CVN-68).  We've been deployed since March 3, and we're looking at staying out here until sometime between September and November.  Since we pulled out of San Diego, we've steamed halfway around the world, conducting flight operations, drills, and other training in preparation for going on-station in the Gulf.  We began supporting Operation Iraqi Freedom before we actually arrived in the Gulf, sending a pair of F-18 Super Hornets to the carrier Abraham Lincoln (which we later relieved).  Since that time, Nimitz has conducted flight operations over Iraq almost non-stop, supporting coalition ground troops and projecting an airborne presence in Iraqi airspace.  The Nimitz Strike Group has also conducted three successful portcalls in the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, and is looking forward to at least a few more before we depart for home.  Conditions in this area of the world are fairly harsh; temperatures shipwide average anywhere from 80-120 degrees, and our proximity to the desert makes airborne dust a constant source of headaches (particularly down in the propulsion plant, where I work; when we first got to the Gulf there were occasions where you could actually see clouds of dust blow through the plant as we passed through the remnants of a sandstorm).  We've managed to work our way past that problem, but only through constant hard work and vigilance.  We've had a few visits from notable figures in the past few months; the names include Conan O'Brien, General Tommy Franks (Commander, U.S. Central Command), Wayne Newton, Neil McCoy, the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders, Alyssa Milano, and R. Lee Ermey (Gunnery Sergeant Hartman in "Full Metal Jacket").  Some of us wanted Arnold Schwartzenegger to fly out here, but it looks like that probably ain't happening.  Oh, well.  That's about it for now.  There's not that much going on out here right now, but I'll keep posting stuff semi-regularly for y'all to keep up with.  Hope this'll tide you over until we pull back in and I can get back to work on the story in earnest (I've got some other plans for the site as well, but those'll have to wait as well).  Keep pulling for us out here, and I'll be back in a few more months for you to play target practice with.  ;)

      Within the next week, I'll be posting another of my works in progress on CF.Net.  It's not SS/Continuum-related, but given the dearth of content on this site, I figure it'll make a decent addition anyway; at the very least, it'll give the two or three occasional visitors something else to look at besides the usual random, not-too-informative posts on this page and the first segment of A New Legacy that's been there since the beginning of the year...

      I'm tweaking some of the site's design characteristics in an attempt to make it somewhat easier to maintain (I exported the generic site stylesheet that was in the header of every page to a single CSS stylesheet, which they are now linked to instead; this should make sitewide design tweaks much less of a hassle...).  I've also moved SpecMode to the site's root directory, due to the inability of my current FTP uploader to access the subdirectory.  Bleh.  In the meantime, I'm looking into new site designs; if anyone out there feels like lending a helping hand, I'd love to hear your inputs.

      Just a sidenote...I've been having a bit of trouble with outgoing email with two accounts, using four different programs on two different computers (my Tablet PC and my PowerBook G4), and both Earthlink's and DomainDirect's online setup guides have been useless in troubleshooting my problems.  If anyone reading this has any idea what may be wrong, I would appreciate any suggestions.  In the meantime, any e-mail correspondence on my part will have to be done via webmail, so those very few of you who use email to contact me, keep that in mind when waiting for a reply; also, I'll be out of town for about a week, with no cable connection...so I probably won't be doing any sending/receiving until I get back, because I hate doing webmail on dialup connections.  That being said, I'll continue working offline on the new site design, and hopefully it should be done within a week or two.

      Hiya folks.  No, I'm not dead (as just about anyone visiting the site in the last week or so have probably realized).  No, this  site  is not dead, either.  It has simply been on hiatus for the past eight months or so while I was gone on deployment.  That being over with, I intend to try to make up for lost time.  Work on  A New Legacy  will re-commence soon, along with a couple non-SS-related projects I've got in the works.  Just be patient with me, and I'll get everything back up to speed ASAP.

      OK, as you have probably noticed, I still don't have the new story up yet.  I've been working on a couple of other projects, at this site's expense.  Well, I hereby resolve to have  New Horizons  online at CF.Net before year's end.

       urlLink Chapter 1  is up (finally!), and chapters 2 and 3 will be joining it as soon as I get them formatted.  It's a bit different from the norm, but I figure it'll help fill in the gap from the lack of  A New Legacy  updates...

      It would seem that I haven't updated here in quite a while.  BUT...this site isn't quite dead yet!  New Horizons should be updated with part 5 within the next couple days, which should start the process of bringing the Continuum Fanfiction Network back up to speed!  In other news:  urlLink Spectator Mode , the segment of CF.Net in which I post pretty much anything I darn well please, has been splintered off onto its own domain, and can now be reached at:  urlLink http://www.specmode.net .  Well, enough plugging for me...back to writing!

      Whoa...didn't realize that it had been so long since I've done anything with this site.  Well, that's gonna change right now.  As you can tell, I've changed the site template to something a bit easier on the eyes, and the changes aren't gonna stop there.  I'm going to be working on shifting the current CF.Net archive to the new schema, updating and adding material where necessary...  ...but that's just the beginning.  I've got a few more ideas for possible future projects, so just keep your eyes on this page.  Oh, and check out CF.Net's sister site,  urlLink Spectator Mode  for random blogging goodness. :D
