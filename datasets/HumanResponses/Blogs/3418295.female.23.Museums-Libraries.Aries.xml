      some of the people in my house are driving me crazy.  A. and D., to be specific.  A. is OBSESSED with the house being clean/organized.  ummm, hello.  if you like a clean and orderly house set up in the way you yourself would prefer, in the style to which your martha stewart ass is accustomed, do not move into an arts collective with 14 other people who have about a thousand better things to do than clean.  if your priority is a neatly organized space, do not move in with a bunch of artists who prioritize doing art, having space for art, and storing their art.  her talking about how she'd like to turn the metallurgy/woodworking workshop and tool storage space into a yoga room (because "that area is an entryway, after all, and all that stuff being there is just so cluttered and shitty and needs to be gotten rid of") was absolutely the last straw, i'm sorry.  this is not an episode of  Trading Spaces .  it is an arts collective.  we do art here.  art which requires a minor amount of clutter sometimes.  we are not going to get rid of a workshop because it is unsightly or because it happens to be located in an untraditional area of the house.  we are not going to get rid of valuable tools because you think of them as "clutter".  also, she completely reorganized the kitchen in a very inconvenient way.  when i moved some stuff back to where it was (because it made more sense that way), she got all snippy about it, as if i had just RUINED her precious kitchen.  grow the fuck up, man.  you want a kitchen designed to your specifications?  go get your own kitchen.     i mean, don't get me wrong.  i like a clean house just as much as the next girl.  it's very nice to have an aesthetically pleasing living space.  i'm generally pretty good about doing my chores.  i get fairly outraged when someone leaves dirty dishes in the sink all day, or hangs greasy pots back up on the rack to be cleaned by the next person, or flakes on an absolutely necessary chore.  however, i take all my pissiness about this with a grain of salt.  i know that if i want a clean house, i can move out anytime i want.  i know i'd much rather live with my poor and sloppy yet brilliant and passionate housemates than 14 soulless and bourgeois neatniks.  also, i am pissed at D. for similar reasons.  reason #1 being that he is constantly guilt tripping me about cleaning, even though i generally pull my weight in that department.  reason #2 being that he never gives anyone else shit about cleaning, even though clearly there are people around the house who do not pull their weight.  and when i call him on this, he inevitably says something like, "but you're so beautiful when you're angry..."  which is either because A) he does all this because he's attracted to me in the first place, in that "kindergarten pulling your hair on the playground" way, or B) he does this for inexplicable reasons, and once called on them, tries to mitigate the whole thing by telling my i'm beautiful.  both of which are absolutely unnacceptable.        as such, i am sick and fucking tired of being nagged constantly about:  A) not yet having done my chore for the week, which is due to be completed next wednesday.   B) not having completed my long term project of re-organizing the library -- because i'm waiting for J to get back from france so that we can devise a fitting-all-the-books-into-the-library strategy, thus saving me a lot of pointless work.  or  C) skipping my (totally non-vital) chore last week -- because i had to prioritize dealing with being sued without having a breakdown.    i am especially sick and tired of this because i spent all afternoon today cleaning out the space and striking the Scape installations in anticipation of the event tomorrow night.  i.e. i spent my day actually helping us out as a collective and helping out shuffy and M. who were attempting to do the whole de-con job themselves.  rather than doing household shitwork which, while generally making our lives better in some intangible way, does nothing to qualitatively help anyone.  i was not assigned or required to do this, i chose to.  because i like shuffy and M. and want to help them out, and because it needed to be done so that the visiting artists can install their pieces tomorrow.       and now, D. has taken over the "chore nazi" title from B.  meaning that i can have endless fun being bitched at all the time about how i don't clean enough and how shitty the space is and how this is all my fault because clearly i do not love The Collective enough, or i would have finished my library project long ago and rather than spending my free time blogging i would be scrubbing grout or something.

      imagine this.  you are standing at your kitchen sink, doing dishes.  you are deep in dish-doing contemplation.  the water is running.  you're scrubbing the crap out of a particularly stubborn pot that refuses to surrender the last of the macaroni and cheese you just had as an afternoon snack.  in between scrubby-attacks, you're trading small talk with terri, a visiting installation artist who is sitting at the kitchen table mixing epoxy and applying it to a concave piece of glass with copper panels inserted into it.    suddenly, your housemate jerel walks into the room and, through the buzz of the rushing water and scraping green sided sponge, says something like, "chjaaaahzzz".  you know, that odd combination of "cheers", "jazz", and "yes" you haven't heard since the day you graduated from high school and left one myrna shexneider behind, for good.  myrna shexneider, you see, was my high school drama teacher.  a 4"11' one-time chorus girl who had her theatrical peak circa 1983 in a Los Angeles production of  Agnes of God , and has spent the rest of her career directing high school productions of "serious" dramatic works at the Louisiana School for Math, Science, and the Arts, in Natchitoches, LA. "chjaaaaahzzz" was (and assumedly still is) myrna's catchphrase.  nobody ever knew what she was actually attempting to say, though we knew it was vaguely positive.  she said it in moments of recognition of a great idea.  she said it when you  finally  got those damn lines down.  she said it when the programs came back from the printer with everybody's name spelled right.  she rarely ever said it in reference to anything i ever did, which is probably why i put the whole thing out of my mind for the entire 5 years between high school and now.    so, now, 5 years later, i just want to say this.  myrna, wherever you are, i'm sorry.  i'm sorry i was such a deadbeat, always skipping rehearsals and waiting until 2 days before we opened to bother to learn the lines.  i'm sorry i never lived up to my potential.  i'm sorry i got a terrible case of laryngitis the very semester we decided to try and do a musical (though i put the blame for the demise of said musical directly on the shoulders of your pet A.K. who had the grand idea of bringing  Sweet Charity  to the high school stage).  i'm sorry my auditions routinely sucked.  i'm sorry i hardly ever had good ideas.  basically, i'm sorry i was a whiny, angsty, erratic thorn in your ass for the 2 years we were forced to interact.

      due to the combination of the stalker thing and the no-sleep thing, i am ridiculously, outrageously paranoid today.  at work this afternoon, i had a mini panic attack upon noticing a grey-suited coporate type with a plain red tie and one of those coily-wired earbuds running down oh-so-discreetly into his jacket.  i was convinced that he was no mere office drone but an FBI agent (he just looked TOO perfect, ok...).  so the whole time he's in the store, i'm having this imaginary conversation in my head where i explain to myself how, if i ever really think i'm being staked out by the feds, i'm not going to run, i'm not going to hide, i'm just going to stand tall and be a martyr for the cause.  what cause?  i have no idea.  but the idea is that i am NOT going to change my behavior in order to avoid my fate.  i figure, the reason i've been red-flagged is because i was willing to stand up for what i believed in, politically.  so why stop now?  why be willing to stand up when the penalty is pretty easy (a night in jail, a minor smudge on your record, a slightly harder time getting through customs), but as soon as the stakes get higher, punk out?  that, my friends, is called hypocracy.    ok.  why am i having this inner monologue, at 2pm on a thursday afternoon in may, a beautiful day, pay day, in fact?  because i am freaking  paranoid , sisters.  i would assume this comes out of the pressure/stress/fear concerning the whole stalker/lawsuit situation.  i mean, he knows where i live.  he knows where i work.  he knows what i think, what my plans for the future are, what my political activities are, what my love life is like.  he's fucking watching me.  and at any time, he could come out of the shadows and confront me.  he's not afraid to act on whatever he thinks of me.  he isn't willing to just stay the fuck out of my life.  his goal, from the beginning of our relationship, has been to make me feel like absolute shit.  and he's very good at it.  and he refuses to give up.    so no wonder i'm paranoid.  it's part of all this shit he's engineered.

      so i've spent all morning and much of the afternoon calling lawyers.  i don't want to deal with regular torts lawyers (defamation and slander fall under torts), because they won't be feminist and won't be able to speak to the whole rape and abuse thing, not to mention the stalking.  however, none of the feminist sources i've called do this sort of thing.  and rather than being like, well we don't do this sort of thing, but here's somebody who does, do you have any questions, is everything ok with you, etc. they're being really cold.  jesus christ, these feminist legal referral services have some vicious receptionists.  "sorry, we don't do that."  "we can't help you."  click.  click.  click.    of course, it doesn't help that this whole thing is very hard to explain.  it's a defamation case, but it's also about rape.  and if he got lawyers, i can see it very easily becoming "you were NOT raped!"  "yes i WAS!" and then losing this case because i couldn't prove that he did, in fact, rape me (because it was him and me alone in a room and i didn't press charges).  which is why i want a feminist lawyer.    however, things are looking up.  in the first place, a lot of people i talked to think i might not need a lawyer at all.  i do have to draft some legal documents, which might require a lawyer to go over, but i won't need to, like, retain the services of a lawyer.  a lawyer won't actually have to, like, take my case.  probably what i will do in that case is have the lawyer who represents The Collective, and who is one of my housemates' sister, look over my answer to his complaint.  or, if that doesn't work out (this all has to be done in like 2 weeks), i have been referred by the manhattan bar association to a cool feministy (i hope) lawyer in the east village who will charge me only a one-time referral fee of $35.  where i'm going to get $35, i don't know.  but in a pinch, it'll have to do.    oh, wait, i also know both law students and lawyers who don't practice in the state of new york.  maybe one of them will do this for me, for free?  hinty mchint...  either way, it's good to know that this probably won't progress any further than the "answering the complaint" stage, due to the utter ridiculousness of the whole thing.  which means that pretty soon i can probably stop being so damn circumspect.

      shuffy's performance went very well.  after that, a bunch of people (myself included) played a marathon game of Risk (or maybe it just seemed that way to me, i'm not a big risk player).  after that, at about 2am, we went out to a diner.  i finally got home at 4:30.  and i had to be at work at 9:30 the next day.  needless to say, i was not a happy camper yesterday.  but after a ridiculous amount of catchup sleep, i'm rested and on my way.    today i have an appointment to fill out interdepartmental job applications up at the museum.  cross your fingers, everybody.    oh yeah, because i haven't mentioned it here yet.  i work at the sattelite bookshop of one of the largest museums in the country, which is located here in new york.  i am not going to name it, just for the record, due to the possibility of stalkers and such.  yes, i know i never used to be this paranoid.  well that's what a lawsuit will do to you, i guess.  i am currently in the process of trying to move up within the museum hierarchy, preferably to a desk job.  so, again, cross your fingers.

       seen on a tee-shirt at work yesterday:    "this shirt is designed to distract girls while i stare at their chest."    i am not making this up.    not only is it offensive, it's also grammatically incorrect! (note to all those i-don't-care/know-about-grammar freaks: the object of this sentence is "girls", plural. then there is a participial phrase "while i stare at their chest," which modifies "girls", if i remember my terminology correctly. thus, "girls" and "chest" must be the same in number. since "girls" is plural, "chest" should be "chests".)    though the guy wearing it was speaking french to his friends, so maybe he doesn't speak enough english to realize what his shirt says. though i doubt it.

       just wanted to let everyone out there know that i am ok. life as usual has kept on keepin' on. went to work today, had to tell my supervisor about the whole stalking thing. made sure she knew not to give out any information about me, let me know if any suspicious people stop by looking for me, etc. bleh. otherwise, work was fine, if exhausting. as usual, someone called out, meaning i had to close 2 registers. which i'm getting alarmingly good at, though i still hate closing registers. and i had to hurry up and get HOME to rehearse my part in tonight's performance.    as i've talked about in the past, in other places, i live in a 15-odd-member arts collective in queens county, new york. i don't want to say the name, and i'm kind of thinking about a pseudonym or something for it, but i can't on the spot, so for the moment it will be known as The Collective (ok, yes, this sounds like something having to do with The Borg. you trekkie ass nerd.). anyway, from time to time, we have public events and shows. for the past month, we've had a sound installation show up, and tonight it is closing. as part of the closing party, my roommate shuffy (ah, finally all those weird nicknames pay off) is performing a song-and-dance number to the standard "Blue Skies". at a certain point in the song, a kickline chorus will come out and dance behind her. i'm part of said kickline. so i had to rush home from work as quickly as possible to make our little dress rehearsal at 8pm. which went well. the whole thing is very low key, so i'm pretty psyched. i'll let you know how it goes.     last night i went to see Guy Maddin's  The Saddest Music In The World , which i enjoyed immensely. if you're not familiar with Maddin (and not many people are), he's an experimental filmmaker from Winnipeg, Canada. his other films include  Tales From The Gimli Hospital , the short  The Heart Of The Earth , and  Careful , among others i either haven't seen or don't remember the titles to.   TSMITW  Pulp Fiction  and Anais Nin in  Henry and June ), and it's about a beer heiress who sponsors a contest to find out which country's music is the saddest in the world. it's set in winnipeg in 1933. though it's so unreal that it really seems to take place on a snowy stage set. or maybe there's some essential essence of winnipeg i'm not getting because i've never been there. who knows. the film is basically the opposite of  Moulin Rouge .   Moulin Rouge  is a period piece that uses contemporary details to evoke what the past might have actually felt like. it centers around the abstract concept of Love. ultimately, it has very little subtext or underlying statement about the real world -- it's just a fanciful tale about early 20th century paris.  TSMITW  is a period piece that uses distinctly old-fashioned film conventions to draw parallels with the modern world. it centers around the abstract concept of Sorrow. ultimately, it is a statement about the world of 2004, not 1933.    also, i'm still working on my Women, The Military, And The Media piece for OTR, as well as another one on the video installations from the Whitney Biennial. they're coming along nicely and will probably be up by the end of the week.  stars Mark McKinney, Isabella Rosellini, and Maria de Medeiros (you remember, Bruce Willis' wife in

       or, more correctly, i have been being stalked (talk about awkward constructions!) for the past two years. i thought it was over. the person who was stalking me, who i will not name or identify here for legal reasons, had not attempted to get in touch with me for over a year. the last time we spoke, i threatened to call the police. i figured, ok, that's that, it's over, i can move on with my life. apparently not. in the meantime, he has been tracing my path on the internet. how, i don't know. though i've figured he somehow found me on a message board i once posted to fairly frequently. he then tracked me from there to my livejournal. from my livejournal, he figured out where i live. and thus, he was able to sue me for defamation of character and invasion of privacy, all for talking about him and our relationship on the internet. he has been following me at least since i last was in touch with him, if not longer. and i had no idea, thought i was completely safe and free of his bullshit.    which basically means that i don't know what he knows, what the extent of all this is. does he have my phone number? he must have my email address. has be been following me home on the train? does he know the places i frequent in the neighborhood -- where i do my grocery shopping, which video store i frequent, what takeout i like, etc? he knows where i work, for sure. and quite possibly what my schedule there is like.     without going too much into my previous relationship with this person, let's just say that the fact that he could come and find me at any moment is frightening. he could come to my job, hide out nearby, follow me home, stake out the neighborhood, befriend my housemates. since all this has come to light (via a summons left on my bed thursday evening), everytime the doorbell rings i shiver a bit.     and, again, he is suing me. and since the nature of the suit involves my conduct on the internet, it makes me afraid to log in to my favorite websites. does he know i'm here? can he find me? he's everywhere. godlike, in a way. i can't do anything, really, without him knowing about it.     i've started this new journal because i refuse to hide from him. i refuse to start my life over again. ever since we parted ways, my life has been one bridge-burning after another. because inevitably he finds me. so i change my phone number, my email address, my habits and haunts. i've moved three times since we knew each other. i'm already afraid to venture too far into astoria because he lives there. afraid to rent videos at Kim's or spend too much time on the upper west side, because those were places we frequented together. i purposefully ignore screenings of my favorite films, because so many of my favorites are his, too. i breathe easy in brooklyn, because he never ventures further than the occasional screening at BAM and visit to his grandmother way out near brighton beach. some people fantasize about moving to williamsburg because of the good bars, plentiful hipster coffee shops, and lovely mckarren park. i fantasize about moving to williamsburg because, to my knowledge, he's never been there. and he would totally hate it if he ever did go. greenpoint or bushwick would be even better, as there was that one time we went to this screening at Galapagos, and while he abhorred it, you just never know.     but this time, i'm not doing it. i like my life now. i have great friends, a good living situation, and a job i enjoy (in theory, if not in practice). i'm in the middle of falling in love again, for the first time since him. this time with someone who, believe it or not, does not make me hate myself. i have a phone number people are starting to remember. an email address that's both easy to understand and possible to put on a resume without blushing. i'm not going to leave all this because of him. to use bush administration logic, he wants me to be afraid. if i change my lifestyle (again) because of my fear of him, he wins. he wants to control my life. he wants to feel important to someone. why should i let him?     so i'm going to continue blogging. this time, hopefully, it'll be a bit harder for him to find me. or at least harder for him to sue me over the contents. i'm going to have to be more cryptic, more guarded. no more long, drawn out descriptions of my day shopping for new sex toys. hopefully, i will still have something to say.

      so, for, like, the past couple of weeks, i have been able to accomplish nothing.  the departure of manstick for ireland last thursday didn't help matters, as he told me i could hang out in his room and watch his TV in exchange for feeding his cat.  this means that, in addition to my general slothitude, i now have access to cable.  needless to say, i have gotten absolutely NOTHING done since he left.  because i have been watching bad, bad soulsucking television instead.  like, for instance, the  urlLink   What Not To Wear   Memorial Day Fashion Myths Marathon, on TLC.    since when did TLC become, like, a live-action evil women's magazine?  i have distinct memories, in junior high and high school, of watching actual documentaries and educational programming on TLC, which does, after all, stand for The Learning Channel.  somewhere along the line, though, it turned into the Brainwashing Women Channel.  i guess it all started with  A Wedding Story , which i have to say i actually enjoyed for a moment there while helping my mom plan her and my stepdad's wedding back in the spring of 2001.  mostly just for the sheer trainwreckishness of the whole thing -- i get a HUGE kick out of passing judgement on other people's choices of clothing, mates, parties, etc, so i really reveled in being able to do it in the comfort of my own home, out of earshot of those i was judging, all through the magic of cable television.  then came  A Baby Story , which i liked not quite as much, because there's just a lot less fun to be had in judging people's reproductive choices and parenting styles.  Though it was kind of cool when they would do a show about an unconventional birth (nonwhite parents, single mom, stay at home dad, midwife/water/birthing center stuff, etc.)  in this phase, TLC was still mostly concerned with documentaries about sharks, with the occasional break for sappy girlie stuff.    Then came  Trading Spaces .   Trading Spaces  was the end of the "we're really an educational channel, we just occasionally show girlie stuff" era for TLC.  This is difficult for me, because i think  Trading Spaces  is one of the best shows on cable.  the premise is brilliant.  it's somewhat educational.  for the most part, the individuals involved are likable and engaging (or at least good to make fun of).  somebody actually gets something out of the whole deal.  it isn't unmitigatedly girlie -- they actually show people building things and using power tools and doing stuff that women are taught are man-things and, thus, off-limits to them.  nobody worries about breaking a nail or getting dirty.  they make the men sew, and one of the carpenters is a woman.  pretty harmless stuff, right?  but apparently it was the beginning of the end.  now, just a few years later, TLC is constant and unmitigated women's magazine style programming.  there are shows about how much you need plastic surgery, how to dress, how you should send your husband off on a weekend golf trip and surprise him by making over the den/study/patio/backyard according to his hobbies (ok, sometimes  While You Were Out  isn't like that, but that's the vast majority of it), etc.    right now, on TLC, they are showing  Birthday  yet another show about pregnancy/childbirth.  This one is less about the whole process of having a child, as  A Baby Story , and more about the gory details.  specifically the gory details of the birth process.  which invariably looks horrifying.  the mother is hooked up to about a dozen machines, and she's wearing one of those awful assless hospital gowns, and she's draped with those terrible blue papery dropcloths, and her hair is disheveled, and she's sweatiing and crying and bellowing like a hog.  which might be due to the fact that she's horizontal, which is not exactly gravitationally optimal for someone pushing themself out of your uterus.  and the nurses are clustered around her making these authoritative "c'mon" type noises, and her family members are divided between cringing and holding her hands and both.  and then inevitably there is some medical problem resulting in a cesaerean section, which is about the most disgusting thing i can envision myself watching on afternoon cable TV, and worst of all, the woman is conscious for all of this.  watching  Birthday  makes me never want to have children.  weirdest of all, i'm not even sure what TLC is really going for by showing this.  are they trying to curb overpopulation?  accustom us double-x-ers to our inevitable barefoot and pregnant fate?  show men how lucky they are to never have to go through this?    weirdly enough, i'm generally very ok with gory things, and especially ok with gory things having to do with female sexuality, reproduction, pregnancy, childbirth, etc.  both of my parents are in the medical field and i have three younger brothers, which means that i was made very familiar with the trappings of "where babies come from" at a very young age, and in a very upfront medical-textbook kind of way.  i've considered becoming a midwife (though decided against it because i just don't have the science background), or at least getting a volunteer job in an abortion clinic.  i'm up close and personal with my own menstrual blood, cervical discharge, etc.  i can handly the gory details of being a woman.  so why does this show freak me out so much?    of course, i know in an abstract way that this is because the idea of childbirth being medicalized in that way bothers me -- there usually isn't much need for all that assless gown/pitocin drip stuff, and there's certainly no need for cable channels to romanticize it (thus leading more women to assume that's the way it's supposed to be, and that, when they are pregnant they should definitely request such things).  but, i mean, isn't childbirth supposed to be horrific?  why do these shows scare me so much, when i have a feeling that if i were experiencing it in person, it would not be nearly so horrifying?  i guess the larger question is this -- what does TLC hope to get, in a social engineering of women kind of way, out of showing this sort of thing?  i mean, the message is not "when you have your baby, you should go medicated all the way, because it's just so awesome!"  the medicalized subjects seem to be in just as much pain and terror as anyone else.  and there's really no control group -- so few shows concentrate on non-medicalized births that there's no real comparison being made.  and i would doubt that they're trying to say "don't have kids!" because, well, patriarchy's MO seems to be keeping us barefoot and pregnant.  so why are there so many of these shows?  what's the point?

      louisiana is so freakin' boring.  i often have this nostalgia for the place i grew up.  i fantasize that i'm going to come back for law school at LSU, then repair to a small town much like the one i grew up in to hang a shingle and get involved in local politics.  eventually moving on up to, like, state rep or something and buying a cute little house in the country, grocery shopping in farmer's markets, sending my kids to the cheap and underpopulated montessori kindergartens and public school gifted programs, maybe even the residential magnet school i graduated from.  et cetera et cetera, imagine a lovely montage of crawfish eating, holidays (even minor ones) with family, getting to know the neighbors and lots of good movies in the mail courtesy netflix.   yeah fuckin' right.  let me remind myself a few of the reasons i really, ultimately, in the real world, don't want to live the small town louisiana lifestyle.   * there is, like, zero access to good information about the rest of the world here.  of course, the internet helps that, but come on.  my father subscribes to two local newspapers (the New Orleans Times-Picayune and the Houma Courier) and has digital cable, which seems to be constantly set to a non-FOX news channel.  he is a total political junkie.  yet he is painfully uninformed about the non-rightwing sanctioned news.  i don't even watch TV and in new york, i'm about a kajillion times better informed than he is.  mostly because i have a steady diet of the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, New Yorker, etc. and know where to go for left-of-pat-robertston fact-based news online.  * this leads us to the fact that my father, living in his small louisiana town, is generally considered locally to be a dangerous leftist radical of some kind.  even though he is, at best, a moderate Democrat.  he isn't even in favor of socialized medicine, for goddess' sakes, and yet he's treated locally like a communist.  i'm about a thousand times more radical than he is (i'm a member of the Green party, godammit!), and i want to go into politics here?  am i high? and even if i could somehow make that work for me, career-wise, it's really hard to be the lone liberal weirdo.  do i want to battle that for the rest of my life?  * under a more shallow rubric, people in small-town louisiana kind of suck.  they wear bad clothes, view the world through a very narrow lense, know nothing about non-cajun food and non-country music, and generally are limited to the dinner-table conversations of fishing, hunting, and how drunk they got last weekend.  do i really want to surround myself with people like this, when i could stay in new york and hang out with artists, writers, academics, and interesting people of all stripes who know about all kind of cool stuff?  * also, You Can't Get Anything Here.  if you want indian food, you have to learn to cook it yourself.  if you want to see a good movie, you have to drive into new orleans or wait for it to come into your netflix queue.  if you want cool clothes, you have to order them online and deal with the whole "will this actually fit me?" drama (not to mention that you'll be ridiculed all over town for not consenting to sport whatever frumpified monstrosity the locals are wearing).  if you want to see good art, you have to get on a plane or completely luck out that NOMA, the CAC, or the new orleans galleries get something decent, which isn't all that likely.  if you want to buy a book that isn't about angels or written by stephen king, you have to, again, either order online or drive all the way to new orleans.   * in a related vein, kids don't learn anything here.  or at least they don't learn anything here past primary school -- there's a new montessori kindergarten here in my town, and my Episcopal elementary school was pretty good.  but high school?  ewww...  none of my brothers or step-people know anything.  Chris, who is headed for sophomore year, is required to read The ABC Murders, by Agatha Christie, this summer for his sohpmomore english class.  now Chris is no honor student, and i was in all the most advanced classes at his age.  but come on.  required reading in high school is pulpy mysteries.  i like pulpy mysteries as much as the next girl, but literature they ain't.  when i was a sophomore, even the students who weren't in accelerated classes read things like Catcher in the Rye, To Kill a Mockingbird, All Quiet on the Western Front, etc.  and those are things that people outside of louisiana read in junior high.  his high school also skips evolution on principle in biology class and doesn't offer lab periods in any science.  history should probably be retitled "Conservative Brainwashing".  students in most subjects find themselves extremely unprepared for college, and kids from this "best school in the parish" routinely flunk out and retreat to remedials at the local community college.    why would i want to raise my kids in a place where they're almost guaranteed to get a shitty education?  * also, as i said in the very first sentence of this entry, louisiana is boring.  there is nothing to do here except drink, do drugs, sit around and talk about drinking or doing drugs, or maybe eat out at mediocre local restaurants.  yeah, you can just drive an hour to new orleans, and there's plenty to do there, but why live somewhere that would require you to drive an hour just to pass an evening?  why not live in the place where there's stuff to do nearby?  so, no, i do not want to move to a small town in louisiana.  no, really i don't.  i'm still considering LSU, and i'm definitely willing to live in new orleans.  but i am SOOOO never coming back to this town, like, permanently.  i don't care if that kills my chances at a political career.  i don't wanna be a politician anyway.  besides which, all the incriminating pictures will do a lot more damage than my choice of locale could.

       A) ummm, did anybody notice the "georgia strait" alliance ad up there? first off, i had a US History thing going on for like 3 weeks running -- what happened to that? then i figured the ad bot or data miner or whatever had gotten its groove back when it went for the tattoo ads. but not 24 hours later, it was on to environmental stuff. how the fuck did my little surveillance droid get the idea that i was interested in the environment? i mean, don't get me wrong, i'm all about nature, saving the whales, recycling, etc. but i have never written about those issues here. American History -- yes. Tattoos -- yes. Environmentalism -- no. and then, did anybody over at the "Georgia Strait Alliance" remember that country singer George Strait (Straight? how did he spell his name?) before they named their organization and bought shitloads of Blogger ad space to promote themselves?     B) i've come to a conclusion about the tattoo. flux factory is going to float us the security deposit for the benefit, so we don't need my excess cash. i've decided about the design as well. i'm still debating whether to just do it now, or to really wait until the fall. i'm tempted to just do it, because i have a feeling that if i wait until october i'll spend the money on something else or never get around to it.     C) tomorrow morning i leave for a weeklong stint in louisiana. or, should i say, a 3 day stint in louisiana and a 4 day stint in florida. my trip home just so happens to coincide with my grandparents' 50th wedding anniversary, and my aunt and uncles have planned a mini-reunion of sorts. which is nice, i guess. though i won't get to do most of the stuff i had planned. and Baton Rouge is in Atlanta. and i'll be missing Portland and Shreveport by a matter of weeks. but it should still be fun.

       i think i've figured out why i was so upset yesterday (and most of today) about breaking up with manstick.      i was so upset because for women, the breakdown of any relationship represents failure. we are conditioned from the day we're born, as women, to nurture people and build relationships. to play nice. to be popular. to help people. to make sure things run smoothly for everyone but ourselves. so anytime there is evidence of a lack of nurturance, that means that, as a woman, you have failed. this is true of every relationship, from your hairdresser to your lover (whether that person is male or female; this also accounts for the notorious "lesbian drama").     a huge aspect of this pressure to nurture is manifested in romantic relationships. a breakup, no matter how sensible and mutually desired, means, we are conditioned to believe, that we have failed to nurture love, failed to make our partner happy enough. that we did something wrong, or were somehow lacking. even when we know that isn't true. in my head, i know that i was the one who wanted to break up in the first place. that our relationship wasn't going anywhere. that manstick and i are in very different places in our lives, and because of that we're really not compatible in a long term way. i know this. it makes perfect sense. but, in my heart, i failed. i messed up. i tried too hard. i wanted too much. i fell in love too fast. i said the wrong things at the wrong times and have too much of an undergrad sensibility about me to mix well with his friends. and fuck, what 30 year old adult wants a moony puppydog 23 year old following him around? these are not things he ever said to me. what he said to me, over and over, was that i was a wonderful person who deserved amazing things, things he couldn't give me because, for reasons he can't explain, he just  couldn't . and back to my head, i know he's telling the truth. i did nothing wrong. it just didn't work because, well, sometimes even the best things don't. but my heart won't hear it. because what i call "my heart" is that part of me that has completely bought into patriarchy's nurturing mission for women.         the "breakup = failure" part of me really wants to drive home the point, too. it's amazing how i can bring all normal functioning to a halt by thinking the thought "no one has ever been in love with me. no one ever will be." as if this is A) true, or B) relevant to anything. i don't even believe in love, in my rational mind. romantic love is a patriarchal lie cooked up a few hundred years ago to save the institution of the family after the seams started busting on the economic framework. romantic love is the strongest bar on women's collective cage. also, how can i control who is in love with me? if people don't recognize my awesomeness, or can't give me my rightful due as an amazing person, how is that even my fault? isn't it just their loss? why do i feel that i am directly responsible for other people's lack of appreciation?

       so i went ahead and changed styles.    however, i noticed that all my font sizes are exactly the same as they were.  meaning that the template-reset probably did not accomplish anything.  someone PLEASE tell me if it did, though.    also, i've noticed that my archive pages are a hodgepodge of obsolete styles.  how can i change this?  the old-template coding doesn't seem to be showing up in my new template.  how can i change the appearance of my archives?

       i'm thinking of getting a tattoo.      well, really, i've been thinking of getting a tattoo for a few years now. it's just that now i might actually have the money to really do it.    you see, because we are paid so miserably at the museum, an incentive system has been put into place. every month we meet our collective store sales goal, each employee gets a bonus. the bonus gets exponentially higher depending on how well we do (if we do 5% better, we get 50% more bonus money, if we do 10% better we get double, etc.).     my first month of eligibility for the incentive system (only long term permanent staff is eligible) was may. however, there's a bit of lag time on the bonuses, so i just got my first incentive check yesterday.      i'm actually doing ok, financially, these days, and while i could probably use the money more wisely, it's not really       that much   money. i mean, i couldn't go on a trip with it or buy any particularly useful important stuff. i guess i could save it, but for what? and i've always really wanted a tattoo.     of course, this will require a lot of planning and forethought. it's not like i'm just going to go off next weekend and find a tattoo parlor and just get it, on impulse. firstly, i need to hang on to the money for a bit. the benefit i'm planning needs a security deposit for our venue. we'll probably be able to get a loan from another group or come up with the money another way. but having the cash on hand, just in case, would be good. and either way, it's a refundable deposit. so even if i did have to contribute my bonus, i'd be getting it back after the benefit.     so that puts getting the tattoo, minimally, in september. and i also have to find a tattoo artist, decide officially on the design, consult with said artist, get an estimate, etc. and apparently, the best time of year to get a tattoo is winter, because it's better to keep new tattoos covered, and sweat can aggravate them. so i will probably let the process take however long it needs to take so that i can actually do the inking in october or november.     as for designs, i have been thinking about this for quite a while. right now there are two basic options. which one i get will probably depend more on price than anything else (i want each equally and may eventually end up with both). option A is the design of  urlLink the labyrinth at chartres cathedral , which i would get maybe 5 or 6 inches in diameter on my lower back.  option B is  urlLink the women's liberation symbol , which i would get fairly small in one of several possible places, most likely on either of my shoulders, but possibly somewhere in my lower abdominal area or upper thigh. additionally, a good friend has a very small "infinity" symbol right near her pubic area, which looks really cool. i'm not sure i would get "infinity", but maybe something else really tiny and simple and cryptic in the same area.    any big tattoo nuts out there? any advice for a novice? i know about safety and being careful and finding a good artist and really knowing what i want. i guess i just want stories, advice, support, whatever. any big tattoo haters out there? tell me what you think, too. any possible design would be subtle, tasteful, and aesthetically pleasing. and it would go in an easily-coverable part of my body. but tell me what you think, anyway.

       accordng to many   people who've tried to read this blog, the font size has a tendency to be wonky.  as in, gigantic.      my computer, for some reason, does not reveal this.  when i look at my blog, the font seems fine.  so i have no idea how to fix whatever is wrong.  if i go into my template and putz around, i can't tell if whatever i just did worked.      i had decided to just switch blog styles.  this one is nice and all, but i'm really having a hard time with the font size thing, and there's no real significance or design concept.  it just looked the coolest.      but when i logged in to make the switch, it turned out that blogger had made some changes.  changes that most likely affect font size.  i can now control the appearance of my text as i post, as opposed to having to fiddle around in my template.      now, theoretically, i should be able to head off any possible font problems by publishing in blogger's "small" font size.   however, i don't know whether A) this is actually working or not, or B) whether there has been any change to past entries.      since i can't tell the difference (on my computer, the font has always looked fine), i would really appreciate a heads up on what this looks like to everyone else.

       manstick and i are officially no longer an item. to tell the truth, it was mutual. things actually went ok. but why is it that, even when i'm saying something i'm completely ok with, and it's being recieved well by the other person, and everything seems to be mutual, i still have to cry like a fucking child? i mean, seriously. i   wanted   to break up with him. i knew very well the problems in our relationship, and the bumpy road that lay ahead of us if we stayed together. i knew how i was feeling, and i had an inkling of how he felt, too. i had thought everything over, and i had no illusions. also, our relationship is really changing mostly in name; aside from us not sleeping in the same room anymore, not much is really going to be different. so why must i act like a little girl about the whole thing?      i guess in a way i wanted him to be like, "oh, no, we can work things out, we can change things, it'll be ok" or whatever, and for him to convince me that we shouldn't break up. which i knew was not going to happen. but i did kind of want it to.      oh, and we're still going to hang out on sunday.  which is nice.

        1. At what age did you realize you were gay?   14, but i didn't really come out for real ("ummm, i'm kinda, umm, bi-curious, i guess..." doesn't count) at 21.       2. What did you do when you first came to this realization?  i don't remember. i sat on the notion of being queer for 3 or 4 years before i acted on it in any way (hooking up with a girl for the first time, joining the LGBT alliance at school, telling a few people, etc.). and then it was another few years of very gradually coming out, till i became officially open about it to just about everyone in my life maybe 2 years ago.        3. Who was the first person you told?  in my own funny way, i made references and such to various people my senior year in high school. i also told the first guy i dated in college that i was "bi-curious" (HATE that term now). but the first person i "officially" came out to was Granger. over email, too.       4. How did they react?   he told me that was great, and he's here for me, and all the rest.       5. Did you go through a period of time thinking that you were bisexual?  i was "bi" for the first 7 years i was aware that i was gay. then for 2 years i was a lesbian. now i'm starting to think bisexuality again.       6. Did you ever date/get intimate with someone of the opposite sex?    a few times.       7. Now that you define yourself as gay, would you date someone who is bisexual?  i'd be a hypocrite not to. and it's kind of annoying me that being "gay" and being "bi" are clearly two totally different things according to whoever wrote this meme.        8. Would you ever date a drag king?  it would depend. i think drag kings are kind of lame. i get it and all, but it's just not my thing. and i would be pretty unlikely to date someone who was really into it. not because it would be an insurmountable difference or anything, but just because i'd be unlikely to fall in love with someone who was totally into something i find kind of silly.       9. Would you date someone who was HIV positive?  i've never been in that situation, and i don't think i can say what i'd do.  take it as it comes, i guess.          10. Have you ever seen Cher in concert?   no.  i am what they call a "Lesbian".  that's a woman who is sexually attracted to other women.  we do exist, you know.         11. If there was a pill that could make you straight, would you take it? Why or why not?   hell no!  most of the time i'm wishing i was more dykey.         12. Is assuming that *most* gay men are whores and/or drug addicts a fair assumption to make or an unnecessary form of stereotyping?  this is the most ridiculous meme question ever. i mean really. yeah, i think all gay men are crack whores who take it up the butt for money. what the fuck do you think?       13. Is Tom Cruise "one of you"?   ok, that last lame question might be surpassed by this one...  who the eff cares what tom cruise's sexual orientation is?        14. Do you use the words "fag" and "dyke" but then get upset when someone straight uses them?  it depends on the context. though sometimes i feel it's a bit presumptuous. it kind of bothers me how much margaret cho uses the word "fag". even though i know she's, like, on our team and everything. and she's my absolute freakin' hero.       15. Are you sure it isn't just a phase, like Anne Heche?   god, leave that woman alone.  everyone is bisexual, to a degree.  and how do we know it  was  just a phase for her? how do we know she's not dykin' it up in the privacy of her own home right now? historically it has been very difficult for mainstream celebrities to be out to the world. thus, i don't think any of us can speculate much about which celebrities are and aren't gay. for all we know, hilary duff is giving britney spears the orgasm of her life as we speak. as for myself and phases, i don't believe in that. the whole point of queerness is that you fuck who you want to fuck. if i choose to sleep with a woman, that's my business. if i choose to sleep with a man, same thing.       16. If someone saw you walking down the street, would they know right off the bat that you are gay?  probably not. but that's because most people don't know what lesbians "look like". they assume we're all butch bikers or something.       17. Have you ever been to a rave?   what the fuck does this have to do with being gay?       18. The BEST part about being gay?   ummm, all the foxy ladies?       19. The WORST part?   being totally invisible.  and this new "marriage protection act" doesn't make things any sweeter, either.

       i'm thinking of breaking up with manstick. well, i'm not sure one could accurately call it "breaking up", because all this time (5 months now) we have never been officially "together". his terminology, not mine. this actually annoys me only a little bit, and it's not the reason i want to break up with him (or whatever the correct terminology would be when you end a relationship that was never a "real" relationship).      why do i want to, for lack of a better term, break up with him? because things used to be so much more fun before. and now they're not. i have an inkling why this is, but it's difficult to articulate.     it all started with the heat. when it got hot, manstick started letting me sleep in his room more often. until, over the past few weeks, i've been sleeping there almost every night. this is a nice gesture, i guess. as i made clear yesterday, it is really hot. and my room is the hottest part of the house. manstick has windows and a window-unit air conditioner. it's really nice of him to want me to be comfortable.      but at the same time, this causes us to spend way more time together than we usually do. more time than either of us really wants to spend together. he needs a lot of space. generally, i think this is a good thing. i need my space too. i like that he's not clingy, and that he doesn't require my constant adoring presence to feel that i'm really engaged in this relationship. i have my own shit going on. and now that he's not getting his space (because he tells me to stay, so i do, because i'm not a fucking mindreader), he will simply ignore me and watch television, kill hours taking stupid internet quizzes, and reading in bed. as if i'm not even there. this frustrates me.      i'm not averse to spending more time with him, in the abstract, but not if he's going to be like that. i either want to hang out with him and have him be fully present, or i want to go do my own thing. even if doing my own thing means sweating a little due to the heat. it bothers me when he's doing something on the computer, and i'm sitting there reading the paper (a section he's clearly already read because it was all unfolded on his couch) and i comment on a certain article, ask his opinion, whatever, and he actually says, "could you please not ask me that right now?" and not because he's busy doing something he actually needs to do, but just because he didn't feel much like hanging out with me in the first place. all you have to do is say, "i need my space right now." i can entertain myself. i will not die without air conditioning. i've lived without it for three summers before now, i can certainly do without for another.     so, basically, there is this assumption that i will sleep/hang out in his room just about every night. which, since we both need space, ends up meaning that the two of us spend time in each others' presence, but with the bare minimum of interaction. like some freakish old married couple. we are not an old married couple. we are in a 5 month non-relationship. how does a relationship go from "we're not really        together   together" to "old married couple" without at least a short pause at "blatantly in love"?       if this is what he is like in a relationship, i would rather not be in one with him. i would rather just be friends. he knows i'm in love with him. and he's made it pretty clear that he's not in love with me. i can deal with this -- i'm not asking him to be in love with me, i really just want to have a good time. but i'm not having a good time anymore. i don't understand why someone would reject the good part of a relationship (the being in love part), and readily accept the annoying parts (the coexisting in the same space even when you don't want to part, for instance). this is someone who doesn't seem to be particularly keen on introducing me to any of his friends that i haven't already met via flux factory. but he is apparently ok with having me in his room like an extra piece of furniture, even when he'd rather be alone. how incredibly stupid.     the only thing at this point is when to do this. we're supposed to go out on a date-like thing on sunday; rather than going on real dates, we like to schedule a day we both have off and go do something vaguely date-like but generally taking all day and involving more planning, travel time, etc. this is one of the best things about our relationship. anyway, we are supposed to go do this on sunday. is it acceptable to "break up" with him during that? if so, when's the right time? in the car on the way there? while we're there? in the diner at lunch? on the way home? after we get home? they all send generally bad messages. should i just put it off till monday? wouldn't he then find it kind of weird that i'd just spent an entire day with him without saying anything? should i do it before sunday, most likely sacrificing a fun outing? should i wait longer? if so, how long? i'm leaving town for a week on wednesday, and after i get back chris will be here for a week -- i can't break up with him then. but i feel like any day prior to wednesday is either too "why did we just spend a day together and you didn't mention this?" or "why are you waiting till 12 hours before you leave town to drop this on me?"      this is a very bad time to break up, clearly.  though it always seems to be.

      there is steam coming out my ears, i swear.  i'm so hot i can't even type.  my fingers are all overheated.      somebody took my fan.  i left it in the living room for less than 24 hours, and somebody took it.  of course, i could do the sensible thing and put out an email about it.  but i'm too hot.      this post will be much reminiscent of my "i'm so fucking tired" post of a few weeks back.  except this time i'm hot.  i'm so hot i just want to curl into a ball and cry like an infant.      i often say, southerner that i am, that i prefer summer to winter because, no matter how hot it gets, the heat is somehow bearable.  but at a certain point, there's just nothing you can do about the cold.  so you must succumb to it, go home and get in your bed and pray for springtime.      well, southerner that i am, i am stupid.  i said those things because i was completely coddled by central A/C for 20 out of 23 years of my life, and the other 2 summers before this one weren't NEARLY this hot.  or at least that's what i'd like to believe.  i guess i just always had a window in my room so i could open it and get some air, and now i can't, so i'm being a bitch.      aaaaaagh!  i have to go pound on manstick's door again.  he is ignoring me.  and at my hour of need, too.  cool air-hoarding asshole.

       this post is taken pretty much verbatim from something i posted at another board.  sorry to dissapoint anyone who's already read it already.       one gripe, and one real problem i need advice on.     first, the gripe. i hate hate HATE it when people come in and demand a discount for no real reason. i work in a museum shop, so we offer discounts to members of the museum, as well as employees and volunteers from other museums and cultural institutions throughout the country. we also have a practice of giving 10% off to teachers who are buying educational materials to use in the classroom. this is pretty substantial, IME. i've never worked in a retail setting so generous. especially considering that we are a nonprofit and all the proceeds from what we sell go directly to the museum.      today this woman walks up to my register with one of our shittier and less intellectually interesting coffee table books, called "Barons of Business", which is about the fabulous homes and possessions of industrial era tycoons. i secretly refer to it (in my mind, mostly) as the "Look At All The Cool Stuff You Plebians Will Never Have" book. it's the kind of book people only really buy for corporate gifts, or when they have to get their boss a birthday present or something.      i start ringing her up and ask, as i ask everyone, "are you a member of the museum?"       usually if someone is not a member but is otherwise eligible for a discount, they will mention it then ("no, but i'm a curator at the Andy Warhol Museum out in pittsburg" or whatever).      the woman says, "well, i'm a teacher. does that qualify me for anything?" i look down at her purchase, and see "Barons of Business", which, i should mention, has already been marked down from like $60 to $19.98 or something equally cheap for a coffee table book. it's one of the "best values" in the store (despite it's incredible lack of quality). i say to the woman, "we really only give discounts to teachers when you buy something you plan to use in the classroom. what do you teach?"      "english," she says, "but, um, i also teach a class on, uhhh, travel and tourism." yeah bloody right. i glance down at the book again, and then squarely into her eyes. even if i did believe that there was such a thing as a high school class on travel and tourism and that this woman taught such a class, "Barons of Business" isn't really about travel or tourism (other than the fact that, i believe, many of the homes and properties in the book are at least partially open to the public). it's about how well these capitalist fatcats and their heirs have done for themselves. if she had said she was an economics teacher or a history teacher, i would maybe, just maybe have let her slide.      but she wasn't, so i didn't. i said, "i'm sorry, i don't think i can give you a discount on this. it is marked down to $20 from $60, though, which is a pretty good deal already." trying not to sound completely heartless. she gives me a look (not a "but i'm just a poor english teacher" look, mind you, but an "i am such a cheap bastard, why can't everything just be free?" kind of look), pays, and leaves.     sorry for that long gripe.  and now for the (shorter, i promise) real worry.     $100 went missing from my register today. there were only 2 people officially assigned to that register -- me and one other girl, who is incredibly trustworthy and well-liked by associates and managers alike. i, on the other hand, while being generally trusted and getting along with everybody OK, got a dressing down from the manager of the store yesterday (on an entirely unrelated matter, but still).      but then there's one other girl who may have (briefly) rang on that register while covering my section so that i could do her a favor in her section. a somewhat suspicious favor -- a really unorthodox request that shouldn't have required me to physically go to that part of the store, but rather than bitch i just did what she asked me to like a nice coworker, and even specifically told her she could ring on my register while i was gone. and in addition to it being such an unorthodox request, she acted really strange about it. and she's only been there 2 weeks, and in the past 2 weeks, there's been money missing out of another register (i'm not sure whether she worked that register or not), which to my knowledge has not happened at all in the 10 months i've worked there (including the holiday season with all those temporary people coming and going). there's definitely an aura of mystery surrounding this girl ending up in my section for 10 or 15 minutes. i don't want to point fingers, but i've already told the manager who was on closing duty tonight that i felt weird about this suspicious and unorthodox favor she asked of me.     because i'm not exactly in the good graces of my boss, and the fact that the other girl who was assigned to my register is so incredibly trustworthy, and because as the closer i was somewhat responsible, i am really, really worried about the implications of this. has anybody else ever been in this situation, or had to deal with a similar one from a different perspective (as the manager, as the trustworthy coworker, etc.)? any advice? any at all? please?

      after a conversation with a tourguide friend of mine, i hit upon the idea to make a list of all the national historic sites i have visited over the years.  as a third generation history nerd, this is a lot of work.    i have been visiting historic sites since birth.  probably in utero, too.  one of my earliest memories is of a trip to Chalmette Battlefield (site of the battle of new orleans) at the age of 3 or 4, riding canons and pretending to be one of jean lafitte's men.    i've been to so many battlefields i actually can't sort them all out.  even reading over lists of sites doesn't help much, as we've covered a lot of ground over the years.  my childhood seems to be one long car trip, with interminable stops to admire native american earthworks, important historical landmarks, and battle re-enactments.  i know i've been to just about every historical site in louisiana.  and then there are names like "shiloh", "chickamauga", and "manassas" that ring a bell for some reason, even though i have no actual memory of them.  i remember vicksburg (multiple times), and yorktown, and that state park in arizona with the anaszazi ruins.    my favorite kinds of historical sites are the ones that involve re-enactments and restored historic settlements.  this is probably because my favorite part of the history isn't which general ordered which regiment to march over which hill, but what their kids and wives and grandparents were doing while they were occupied thusly.  there's a special place in my heart for Fort Michilimacinac, Jamestown, and Vermillionville (a site that re-creates 18th century Lafayette, LA, home of the largest cajun settlement in the state).  one of my dreams is to be a re-enactor.  it dissapoints me that there are no restored reenactment sites in the new york area.  also, that most reenacting is a sort of hobby taken up by men who want to reenact famous battles.  how boring.  and so few roles for women...  here's my list of visited historic sites so far.  i'll post an update after i talk to my dad and grandfather.  revolutionary war and colonial period: yorktown jamestown williamsburg michilimacinac lots and lots of colonial louisiana sites, too many to mention here.  civil war:   chickamauga donelson manassas pea ridge (?) shiloh vicksburg wilderness chancelorsville fredricksburg spotsylvania port hudson   other sites: natchez trace chalmette battlefield more louisiana sites  i haven't yet factored in new york sites yet.  that takes a lot of thought, because historical sites in new york are not typically mapped off and declared "official historical sites".  they're just sitting there, steeping in history.  i've stood on the spot where hudson supposedly made first contact with indigenous manhattanites.  i've walked across the brooklyn bridge.  i've hung out in central park, washington square park, and union square, home to many a historic gathering.  i've spent time in grand central and the new york public library, some of the finest historic buildings in the country.  but the only "official" new york historical site i've visited is Fort Wadsworth, a fortification dating from the early 19th century that has, as luck would have it, never seen combat, and thus isn't particularly rich in history.  yet it's the officially sanctioned deal.  whereas little more than a plaque marks the site of the first african american cemetery in the country, over near the corner of delancey and chrystie streets.

      i found out tonight that the naked wanking guy i saw under the overpass the other night is apparently a new fixture of the neighborhood.  apparently he is schizophrenic (though i have no idea how anybody would know this).  housemate D's ex-girlfriend, who lives nearby, saw him on her way home from here a few nights before i did, apparently.  also naked, also jerking off, also behind the fence.  there is some question as to his ability or desire to get out from behind the fence.    what do you do about this?  i was assuming he was just a regular dude with an exhibitionist fetish, who would eventually finish spanking it, get dressed and either go home or begin acting like a typical not-looking-for-trouble homeless guy.  now it turns out he's just there, or potentially wandering the neighborhood, a somewhat permanent fixture of the area.  what can be done about this?  i have (understandable) issues about fucking with homeless people.  shelters suck.  you're just as likely to be assaulted, raped, robbed, etc. there as you are to find a safe situation, especially if you're a naked schizo with a tendency to masturbate in public.  i'm not sure what reasonable options there are for mentally unstable homeless people -- i would assume that you eventually just get dumped in a state psycho ward.  which i wouldn't wish on anybody, public wanker or not.    so i feel very conflicted about going to the authorities.  on the one hand, this guy's behavior amounts to harrassment.  i felt very threatened, walking by, seeing him jerking off like that.  also, i was triggered.  but on the other hand, it turns out he's probably not mentally ok.  he probably doesn't even know what he's doing.  he could very well be autistic or have some other developmental disorder wherein he isn't even really able to function on the level of "we don't masturbate in public".  or he could just be nuts, which amounts to the same thing.  he probably wasn't trying to hurt or harrass anyone.  but then again, his continued existence in my neighborhood freaks me out.  why should i be subjected to a public wanker, just because he's crazy and doesn't know any better?  why should i have to be afraid to walk under the overpass?  why should i have to be triggered every time i need to take the 7 train?  there's now only one train stop which is safe enough for me to walk to after dark and also doesn't trigger me in some way.  and sometimes that stop isn't an option.  what do i do?

      i cannot put into words how amazing  The Chelsea Whistle  is.  if you want to know what it's like to be me, read this book.  seriously.  except for the stepfather part, and the fact that i grew up slightly more economically secure, this book is my life.  i can basically never write a memoir now, because michelle tea already wrote mine.

      at about 5 till 11 (pm), i decided i was really, really hungry, and the one thing i wanted most in the world was a bagel with cream cheese and lox*.  lucky for me, there is a 24 hour bagel shop over on queens boulevard that stocks actual fresh lox (even in manhattan, even at the ritzy places, you often only find lox spread, which is gross and just does not satisfy my lox cravings).    *(for any and all southerners -- lox is smoked salmon.  why is it called lox and not just smoked salmon?  i don't know.  that question is right up there with "why do they pronounce it 'house-ton' street?" and "why do yankees drink pepsi?")  anyway, the one thing i wanted most in the world was a bagel with cream cheese and lox.  and i knew it was right up the block on queens boulevard, waiting for me.  so i stuck $5 in my pocket and went off  to satisfy my craving.  even though it was like 11pm by then, and the bagel shop is in the sketchier direction from my front door, my walk over to the bagel shop was uneventful.  i ordered, paid, and ate there, because i felt kind of weird about craving bagels and lox at 11pm.  i have strange food anxieties and often don't want other people to know what i eat, and in what quantities.  but that's another story for another post.  so i figure i left the bagel place around 11:15 or 11:30.    my walk back home was largely uneventful as well.  i made sure to keep to the better-lit side of the street, and stayed extremely aware of anyone ahead or behind me, cars pulling up, etc.  100 yards or so before my door, i have to walk under a train-track overpass.  this is the sketchiest part of the walk for some reason, even though it's very well lit down there.  but it's just scary.  there's this big fenced-off area just to the left of the sidewalk, with barbed wire, and generally there's interesting garbage piled behind it.  i once saw a chair, just sitting there under a shaft of sunlight coming down from the tracks, as if it were part of a stage set lit with a spot, waiting for an actor to take his place.  so sometimes (generally during the day) i glance over in that direction, just to see what intriguing trash is around.  i kind of understood, subconsciously, that a homeless person, or perhaps people, lived there.  but generally, at night, homeless people are discreet.  they sleep bundled up in heavy clothes and newspapers, behind whatever bulky objects they can gather, facing away from the street.  they want to blend in with the night, avoid being noticed.    so it really surprised me when, tonight, i glanced idly in the direction of the fenced-area, just to see what i could see, and what i could see turned out to be a naked man with a pretty substantial erection, jerking off.  standing right there out in the open, mostly under the light.  in the perfect "i can see anyone who walks by but most likely they won't notice me" location.  at the perfect "i am jerking off to you" angle.  less than 10 feet from me, seperated from me by only a chain-link fence and some barbed wire.  it was like some bixarre, threatening exhibit at the zoo.    it took like 2 seconds for me to realize that, if he got in there, he must be able to get out.  and he was naked, with an erection already.  he could easily jump right out of the fenced area and grab me, and...  so i quickened my pace to a near run.  i didn't fully break out into a run because, and this is kind of funny, i didn't want to threaten him, or make him feel bad, like he was scaring me or something.  yeah, there's a naked man jerking off out in the open under an overpass, and i'm worried about him getting offended that i ran away upon seeing him.  i walked as fast as i possibly could towards home, glancing over my shoulder and preparing to reach down into my bag for my cell phone if the need arose.  knowing that any one of a number of guys in my house, all of 100 yards away, would gladly run downstairs and outside to protect me (or at least act as a witness) if i saw that guy come out of the overpass behind me.  luckily (?) nothing happened.  i'm not even sure i should have been afraid.  i mean, if for some reason i decided to have a good wank out in the open, even if the purpose of said outdoor wank was to get off on revealing my naked self to unsuspecting passers-by, i'm pretty sure i wouldn't have the intention of running out and raping/molesting one of them.  because that just crosses a line.  so i probably had nothing to worry about.    but !!!!!!  ew!  weird!  scary!  some naked wanking dude, under the overpass, 100 yards or so from home!  i really have to be more careful where i decide to walk alone at night around here.

      i have been a voracious reader most of my life.  as a small child i would read anything.  i was an absolute glutton.  i was like those kids who will eat anything, in ridiculous quantities, to the point of sickness, except i craved the printed word.  all the time.  i remember the dull ache of my need for a book.  especially in the car at night.  especially if i actually had a book with me at the time.  it was like withdrawal pains for a junkie.    i remember the absolute torture of the return trip from Beaucoup Books, my father's favorite semi-local independent bookstore (sorry, i searched high and low for a link, but to no avail).  the day would always be structured like this:  A) drive to new orleans in the early afternoon, listening to WWOZ, parents bickering, brothers fidgeting and fussing, etc; B) stops at Southern Runners, the  urlLink CAC  (pronounced See-Ay-See, not Cack),  urlLink Audubon Park , and/or the gap; C) late afternoon browsing at Beaucoup; and finally, D) dinner at either Warehouse District Pizza or Cafe Siam, followed by a post-dusk drive home.  a drive that would have been lovely (the moon rising above the mist-drenched cypresses, our car skirting the sexy new junction between Highway 90 and I-10) were it not for my severe book withdrawal.  it was too dark to read (despite even the 100% functional streetlights on said sexy new highway).  if i tried to turn on the dome light in the back of the minivan, my father would bitch about not being able to see the road.  there was a brand new book, completely and totally unread and fresh, spine still intact, cover uncreased, right there, in the big brown paper bag with the handles (the only bookstore bags i've ever seen that were actually substantial enough to carry new books for a family of 6) carelessly spilling out between the driver's and passenger's seats.  not 2 feet away.    i probably ruined my eyes once and for all trying to scrutinize the opening chapters of  From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler  in the dim light of the revolutionary streetlights and maybe the brights of an oncoming mack truck.  i never made it further than a few pages like that.  and for all the effort, it probably made the hunger pangs worse.    nowadays i just don't read like that.  of course, i'm always working on something.  i even tend to have books queued.  right now it's  The God of Small Things , next  The Chelsea Whistle  (which i FINALLY found, by the way), and after that, if it's ok with supervisor K, i might borrow that new book about John Singer Sargent's  Madame X  we got in last week at work.  it's rare that i pass a subway ride without squeezing in a few pages of something.  and i make it a point to read at least one or two non-required books per semester.  but outside of my commute and lunch break, i just don't read for fun like i used to.    i'm especially bad about keeping up with the latest bestsellers.  by which i mean things like Jonathans Franzen and Lethem, Dave Eggers, Zadie Smith, Chuck Palahniuk.  not King, Crichton, Grisham, et al.  but anyway, i really suck at reading novels as they come out (or nonfiction, for that matter; i haven't so much as checked the library for either Clinton memoir, not to mention all the recent political tell-alls against the bush administration).  i am literally just now finishing  The God Of Small Things , as i just mentioned, which came out in '97, and which i have been planning to read for at least the last 5 years.  i'm just now contemplating  The Lovely Bones  and  The Corrections , last year's biggies.   Middlesex  and  Oryx and Crake  are twinkles in my eye.  probably end up getting snapped up off the bargain table at Borders the week after i pass the bar exam (ca. 2008).  the worst thing about this is that i'm not waiting to see what the critics say, or to save money on the paperback.  i'm not pouncing on these books the second they get off the "One Week" shelf at the library.  i'm reading them all, no matter how mediocre, and years after anyone else gives a shit.  nobody cares about Arundhati Roy now; Jhumpa Lahiri has taken her place as Subcontinental novelist du jour.    there is a bit of method behind this madness, though.  i hate that feeling of the collective consciousness, with regard to books.  i want to feel like i discovered each and every great book i've read.  i like the idea that each and every literary moment in my life is unique territory.  reading books that are past their prime is good for that -- i'm never reading the same book at the same time as my friends, or somebody on the subway, or oprah.  so as long as i don't really talk to anyone about it, i can feel like each book i read was written just for me.  i can feel alone in my books, the same way i did 15 years ago when all i wanted was to escape a hot, noisy, bicker-filled minivan.

      i am too tired to dive into my template and figure it out.    i'm so tired, i'm too tired to even sleep.  but, at the same time, i'm also too tired to do anything else.  i'm too tired to construct a cohesive blog post.  i'm too tired to make the fan work, so i'm sitting here typing and sweating.  i'm too tired to wash the pan i dirtied cooking scrambled eggs.  i made scrambled eggs because i was too tired to make anything else or think of any better ideas and even too tired to figure out what kind of takeout or junk food i wanted.  i vaguely crave watching (another) movie, but i'm too tired to decide what movie to watch.    what i really want is someone to entertain me.  but no one is at home.  they're all out partying post-opening.  we have another show opening tomorrow, for the new museum of contemporary arts.  there's a draft of a post about it that i hope to finish and make visible soon.  the opening for that was tonight.  i couldn't go, because i had to make up a shift at work.  because i had to go to court.  fuck that shithead.  anyway, so i couldn't go to the opening, which was over at 8 (i worked till 8:30).  having no idea what the post-opening plan was, and figuring that most likely they would all just come home and crash (most of them having had even less sleep than i have), i just came straight home from work.  checked my messages, nobody had even called me to tell me what the post-opening plans were (even though several people knew i would be getting off work in plenty of time to do something).  so i rented  Fire , the banned-in-india lesbian film by Deepa Mehta and sat there feeling sorry for myself.  imagining they'd be home at any moment to tell me all about it and commiserate about being exhausted, etc.  but now it's like 1:30 and they're still out.  and i called several of them, and nobody is answering their phones.  let alone calling me to invite me to do whatever it is they're out doing.    so i'm just going to sit here and be exhausted and grumpy and feel sorry for myself.  ok?  i'll fix this stupid font shit later.  fuck all yall.

      i'm about ready to have a shit fit, 3-year-old style.   yet again, for the second week in a month, i'm pulling second shift on a flux project.  this one, however, i actually have a stake in.  but this is no simple construction project.  this is the real deal.    we've been asked by the  urlLink New Museum of Contemporary Art  to create an installation in a neighborhood shop for their upcoming  urlLink CounterCulture  show.  We chose Bowery Martial Arts Supply, and our installation is called "Secret Places".  In the shop's back stock room, we're setting up a sort of Flux Factory Espionage, Inc.  4 video monitors form the centerpiece of the physical installation.  upon entering the room, a participant chooses a difficulty level, from "Basic" to "Special Operations", and then hits a button on the video monitor, thus queuing up their "mission".  the mission, if they choose to accept it, will force them to interface with the neighborhood in new ways.  reconceptualizing and finding new ways of seeing the space.    this is a lot more complicated than is seems, though.  because in order to pull of our "superspy" aesthetic, it has to be incredibly high tech.  this includes video segmets introducing each mission, which had to be shot on DV with professional-level equipment and real sound editing.  and then those spots had to be burned onto 4 DVD's (one for each level), with no mistakes.  many of the missions were supposed to involve submissions of feedback via audioblogger.  several days before we opened, i set up a fresh blog and an audioblogger account in our name.  the blog itself is fine, but, for reasons still unknown, the audio posts aren't showing up.  so that idea had to be scrapped at the last minute in favor of the technologically inferior pen-and-paper method of recording data (seriously.  we could have at least had a typewriter or a special email address).  dozens of copies of mission instruction packets must be made, and on functional xerox machines.  entire reams of paper must be printed with interesting tidbits for the rest of the files in the "mission files" filining cabinet.  which cannot take place without a working printer actually connected to a computer that is able to connect to the web.      the whole installation is also incredibly complex.  one of the more interesting missions involves a piece of paper with several holes cut in it.  when you hold the paper up to a certain sign in a certain park in a certain way, a secret message is revealed.  of course, it turned out my hand slipped a few times while creating the paper template, so the "secret message" is completely incoherent and must be fixed postehaste.  just relating the complexity of this operation leaves me groaning in frustration.  i'm actually nostalgic for the days of building and outfitting a labyrinth.  days that seem so long ago, even though it's really only a couple of pages back in the archives.  at least that only involved manual labor, and only depended on wood, nails, paint, tools, and our brute force for success.  the New Museum project is a beast of a different color, involving not only menial physical labor (building the installation itself) but brain power, creativity, energy, technical dexterity, and functional electronic equipment.

      and some good news, for once:  so i've mentioned here and there some good story ideas i had that i'm trying to get published, like, for real.  i can't talk about what they are, because at least one of them has to be very much on the DL for it to have any hope of happening (super secret spy mission, basically).    anyway, it's a good possibility that one of them may end up as a piece for NPR!!!  like, nationally!  a friend has a connection there, and apparently i came up in passing, and this friend of a friend thinks my story would make a great piece for a show called "the next big thing", which i believe is nationally syndicated.  another friend of mine has already done quite a few stories for them, which is good because it means that, if they like this one, they'll probably take more.  which means A) writerly awesomeness, and B) $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$!  well, not that much (probably just $$$), but still.  i've never been paid for my writing before, at least not in any real way.  so this will be very exciting, if it happens.  i just hope that talking about it here didn't jinx the whole thing...

      i need to put some space between that last entry and the top of the page.  i'm not sure i can own it enough to blast it up at the top, the very first thing you see when you wander over to this blog.  of course, that timidity of ownership begs the question, did i mean that?  i don't know.  it just sort of came out.  i feel like "hate" is a pretty strong word.  and deep down, i do think this country has potential.  i can't explain it, though.  the logical conclusion, following from my deep shame in the united states and its people and pretty much all of its' 228 year history, is disgust and hatred and resignation.  after a post like that, i should be moving to canada.  but, yet, i do still want to be a lawyer.  i do want to dig into the system, pick out the good from the bad, and use it to help people.  because, like it or not, we are stuck here.  just because america is Bad with a capital B doesn't mean i can lose all compassion for the people it trods upon (oh, god, that is so freakin' pretentious.   upon?   who am i kidding?).    as one can tell from my two more serious recent posts, i am dealing a lot lately with questions of the ideal vs. the pragmatic.  on the one hand, things are bad and wrong, and someone has to cry out against that.  on the other hand, well, here we are.  while crying out against abstract injustice is important, i'm not sure we can accomplish change on such a broad level, without first creating it on a smaller and more immediate level.  how can we get to radically restructuing america without first figuring out how to fix the smaller things?  how can i deal only in the "meta" without first working on the details?  isn't it easier to be fatalistic ("i hate america!"; "gay pride sucks!") than it is to work toward substantive change?    but i feel like i've already spent time trying to work for small-scale substantive change (the anti-war movement, the NOW morning after pill campaign), and it was HARD.  and we failed.  failure is not rewarding.  maybe this large-scale dismissiveness is just my way of dealing with the difficulty of ground-level activism?  only time will tell, i guess.  i need an activist mentor.     where are all the older activists when you need them?  why is it that i run into heaps of them when i'm feeling hopeful, when i'm standing in the street at a march, when i'm in a whirl of press conferences and media breakthroughs and zero hour, but then, when i'm sitting in front of my computer, hopeless and despondent (again, who the fuck do i think i am here?  despondent?  upon?  what, am i John Stuart Mill now?), there's nobody.  i need what Amy Richards had, Gloria Steinem as my roommate...  we've got some rooms opening up in the next few months here.  surely she'd consider it?

      in a matter of minutes, probably by the time i finish this post, it will be july 4, 2004.  it will have been exactly 228 years since the drafting of the  Declaration of Independence .    i'd like to believe those were better times.  revolution was in the air.  people stood up for what they believed in.  they fought and won, and all for the ideals of freedom, democracy, and egalitarianism.  with Thomas Jefferson's words, americans made the transition from petty bourgeois residents of a shitty british colony that couldn't pay its bills on time or quit scuffling with the local indian tribes to a Nation, with a capital N.  a nation that stood for justice, and liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, and all the good stuff.  we were the good guys.  sure, there were loyalists, but most of them were stuffy merchant types who cared more about making a buck than about liberty.  and even after the patriots won, they let the loyalists stay and didn't even penalize them that badly.  because America is good people.  i'd like to believe that, but more and more i have the sinking feeling i was wrong.  just a couple of generations after the Revolutionary War came the dredd scot decision.  You know, the supreme court decision that said that black people were inherently property, and not human, and certainly not US citizens, and therefore had no right to sue in a court of law.  during the war, women fought right alongside the men, and later, sitting home reading Mary Wollstonecraft, they started to think about some of the very things women "started" to think about 75 years or so later at Seneca Falls, NY.  the same things women "started" to think about 40 years ago when the women's liberation movement was born.  and these women of the 1790's brought their own demands to the government of their new Nation, the people who, just a few years before, had fought, right alongside these very same women, for freedom and justice.  and those men, the ones who had so much to say about being "created equal" just sort of ignored them, brushed them off, and eventually they went away.  didn't even make enough noise to get into the history books.  so i know this country was not built on equality, or justice, or liberty.  this country was built on cheaper taxes and freedom to be whatever kind of evangelical nut you wanted to be (as long as you were some kind).    yesterday i went to see Michael Moore's  Fahrenheit 9/11 .  i knew most of the information presented therein already, having slogged through both of his books on the subject, as well as those of Al Franken, Sarah Vowell, and Molly Ivins, and several good articles in  The Nation ,  The New York Times , etc.  and of course i knew, from the get go, that Bush was a bad president who lied to us and failed to do his job and led us into war on false pretenses.  i knew all this.  but there is intellectual knowing, an ability to spout off the facts, and there is the visceral sensation of watching it all play out onscreen.  of seeing pictures of all these people.  of seeing news footage from the election scandal, september 11, the beginning of the war in iraq.  the visceral sensation of historical perspective: A happened, which brought on B, which caused C.  right there, in front of my face, on celluloid and hi-8 videotape.  and this is an entirely different kind of thing from skimming through a book or chitchatting about politics at the dinner table.  this isn't just names in black and white on the page, dry facts.  this is real.  this is people.  this is us.  this is history.  and it's happening.  and it's all our fault, as americans.  that's right.  i realized there, watching this movie, that this war is not bush's fault.  it's not the republicans' fault.  it's not big business' fault.  it is america's fault.  we all stood by and let this happen.  of course, it is partially all those people and institutions' fault.  but it is also our fault.  watching  Fahrenheit 9/11  i realized that america does not stand for justice and right and diplomacy and all the good things.  we are not the good guys.  we are the guys with the greasy hair and bad skin on the dark horses, wearing the black cowboy hats, with the sharp, angry spurs.  we are the bad guys.  and we always have been.  right there, in that moment, i was ashamed of america.  and not in that "yeah, we've made some mistakes, too bad, so sad, sorry bout all those injuns" kind of way.  i am ashamed of what we are.  i hate us.  i hate every single one of us, from President Bush all the way down to myself.  i hate everything this country stands for.  i hate our flag.  i hate every history text i've ever read.  i hate the constitution and the bill of rights.  i hate John Locke and Thomas Jefferson and everyone in between who created our dishonest system of government.  i hate democrats and republicans.  i almost even hate bald eagles, but, really, they're just innocent animals who are just as oppressed by the iron heel of the united states as anyone else (i mean, we did spend 50 or so years trying to drive them to extinction through the use of DDT).  we are bad people.  we stand for terrible things.  we carry out terrible deeds.  on purpose.  with full knowledge of what we are doing.  i hate us.    how am i going to be a lawyer now?

      on the back cover of a book called  The Genealogy Of Greek Mythology : "over 17 fet in length on each side!"  of course, this book is a folded-on-both-sides timeline/genealogical chart.  so it is a somewhat apt description.  but still.  would that convince you to buy?  "ooh, 17 feet?  well, you know, if it was 15, i don't think it would be worth it.  but 17 feet of book for only $25?  that's less than  $1.50 per foot!  now that's a deal that can't be beat!"  i'd like to write a book with more square footage than my room, which is, i think, somewhere around 60 sqare feet.  that's 182 pages, if the pages are half the size of standard 8.5 x 11 paper.  totally doable.  and then on the cover, i'd put a big blurb that would say, "more than 60 square feet of book!"

      it's been a while.  i just wanted to let everyone out there in the blogosphere know that i'm still here, i'm just a bit busy this week.  in addition to the usual work, school, etc, my brother Chris is in town.  so most of my spare moments have been spent getting him totally wasted, as a good big sister should.
