      I just keep being reminded that I should have stayed at Hertz, I did great there always top sales, always went to the award dinner, free lunch for sales. I just don't wan to let my partents know that they are right....   Back to the previous, oh I don't have a CC, well neither do I, but it must be my fault that you don't have one too, right??  DAMN IT!

      I have never been SO freaking frustrated with a job, but I am!  I give the rebuttal and the people are like "no seriously, I have no money", and I get faulted for this. Is it my fault that they have no money, well it must be.  "I am sorry that you are on welfare in a wheelchair, and have no legs, BUT if you could just give me your CC information, I will help you solve the problem"  Somehow this is all my fault and I will lose my job, this SUCKS!  FUCKING SHIT!

      Just in case you didn't already know, DO NOT INSTALL AOL ON YOUR COMPUTER. AOL is a virus and will change settings on your computer and will fuck it up. And then you will call India and they will transfer you to me and I will call you a dumbass!  Thank you for playing, this is concludes the test of the bitching system had this been a real emergency, all of the above would have been listed in caps.  Thank you, Jay

      Well you have hear me complain about my job for the last few days, but you know the job is really good all I do I talk to people who have the worlds largest ISP and don't know how to use a computer. It is always dumb stuff to "My screen says non-system disk error, what do I do?" "Uh, dumb ass eject the floppy and hit any key to continue, that will be $39.99, Thank you for calling. DOne At Home!"  And the other great thing about to day is that it rained and flooded C.S,but isn't it great when it rains you can just sleep 'til 1:30 and have no worries in the world.  Oh even better news Wendy got a job back on Capital Hill so she will be back making no money, but doing something that she really likes. I have never been happier for her.  Well enough for now time to do laundry and finish the big clean.  -smipf

      Today I really wanted to go to Panda Express and try the new chinese food, but as soon as I went to park there was one of the people that I really didn't want to see. OUR MANGER! (oh wait not our mgr, the person that thinks he is our mgr) &nbsp; So I had to go to "Joy Ruck, How I helpa yooou?" &nbsp; The fortune that was with the food was by far the worst   ever  ! &nbsp; "In GOD we trust, all others pay cash" oh and it was in spanish too at the chinese restaurant? " En DIOS confiamos, los demas pagan en efectivo" &nbsp; Yes it was in italics too. &nbsp; I bet that if you played to loto numbers on the back you would have to pay the loto winnings! &nbsp; "And tonights losing numbers are.... 6...&nbsp; 5... &nbsp; 14... &nbsp; 33... &nbsp;36... &nbsp;and &nbsp;49! If you got all 6 numbers right please come and pay us 10 milions dollars!" &nbsp; &nbsp;

      Just exactly who invented alcohol and why did they include something in it that makes you feel like shit the next day. You would think that they were like... "you know what you be really funny, let's make this stuff that is fun to drink, but make you vomit or just hurt the next day!&nbsp; tee hee hee!" &nbsp; Those of you that know Lauren will understand this... "I'm done with this drink" and then throw it across the room. Another thing that makes perfect sense.

" 2nd lady says "I'm not pregnant!" 1st lady replys "Oops your not pregnant, uh thank you"  This is by far the dumbest commercial ever.   Have you seen those A&amp;E shows "Growing up Gotti" or "Airline" these shows are not good but you can't stop watching them. I watched Airline for like 3 hours the other day, and I couldn't stand the show just couldn't turn it off.

      I might have to kill some people before the training is over....  I think that I could probably take calls now with just a little bit of help. There are some people in the training that even if you spoon fed the information to them, oh right that is what Brian is doing, they STILL wouldn't understand anything.  Damn it four more days!

      I am working on redoing my resume, anyone wanna help I'll email you a copy and you can help me fix it.  The solution to yesterday's post.... Happy that is step one. Be more active. Drink less! Just try and be happy. Take better care of myself. Happy did I mention that? Be nicer, and not get walked on by others!  Here in about two days this is all going to be just crap that I wrote and never took a second look at...

      Does anyone else know how depressing it is when just about everyone has moved and you only have one friend left in town, and everyone is moving on and doing something with their life and I am still in College Station being a bum and not doing anything with my life, being extremely in debt and having no money to catch up on that debt, I really just want to move somewhere and start a new life and forget about everything, it would be just great to just move somewhere..... Way to go josh and tesia wish I could do it
