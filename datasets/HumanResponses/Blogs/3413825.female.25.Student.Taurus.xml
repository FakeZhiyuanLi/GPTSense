      Having to work on Saturdays is horrible esp. when its sunny. I mean it just shouldnt be allowed. Its nice to earn some money, but when its so sunny and all I wanna do is be outside working just isnt fun. I met a cool girl at work today though. She made work a bit more enjoyable. I have to work next Saturday too!! &nbsp; urlLink

      So the other night there was this huge nasty spider on my kitchen ceiling. Since Pete was here, I asked him to kindly get it and put it outside or kill it. Well being the nicest mr. peacelover that he is, he said that he wasnt going to kill it. ok- i can understand that, but at least get it down, right? well because the damn thing was in a little corner -like most spiders are- he was hard to get down. I could not sleep knowing that this spider was possibly making babies and in the morning i would have to kill 12 not just 1 so I worked up enough nerve to kill the damn thing. Now, I feel bad because Pete is so sensitive when it comes to animals and insects. Animals are one thing, but insects- man i can smash an insect or spider in no time and not think twice about it--- or so i thought till now. So people tell me what you think. To kill the spider or not to kill the spider? One of my friends gave me a good recommendation and said get a glass jar and trap the spider in that and then slide a piece of paper up behind the back of the jar and the spider will fall in that and then you can throw him out. I think next time I will have to try that.

      This week has been very exhausting at school. Its really hard sitting in lecture all day listening to these wonderful designers who are so famous and successful and not being able to do anything about it. I know that it all just takes time and commitment, but I am ready to start working and really learning hands on. This week is mainly business lectures- how to set up your own business, what kinds of accounting software to use, all the specification, licensing, trade information. One of the designers who set up her company after graduating from college went on to be very successful and was contacted by ppl in japan to go over there and design restaurants, watches, clothes, etc. She said that once you are a designer, the Japanese ask you to design many different things, not just interiors.... (sigh***) someday maybe.   Well, I am starting on gathering information for my first project. I think it will be so exciting, but at the same time kind of difficult. Its only a 3 star hotel and its main competition are all 5 star hotels. But this beach resort has much better beaches and a better location so I need to start sourcing asap. Tomorrow we will get the client brief and then I can start on my design analysis. We have a long weekend- Friday and Monday off- yeah!! I can catch up on sleep!! On Saturday after work, I am going to Sheffield to visit Pete's family. I'll meet his grandmother, who is going blind. I feel so sorry for her, she wants to meet me and see Pete one more time before she is completely blind. Also, Pete's dad's birthday is coming up. I have no clue what to get men for presents- esp. since I dont know him that well. I dont want to get him anything cheesy ya know? Any suggestions?  Oh, I signed up for some online courses (like I have time i know!) but they are free and I think I will be able to learn alot. I can take courses such as HTML, Photoshop, Dreamweaver, etc- it may be useful so that I can set up my own website someday.

      So I am finally trying to get together a portfolio to show prospective companies. After looking through all my projects, its really hard to put something in a portfolio when you think its crap... I wish I had more time to redo so many projects. But oh well, lets just hope that somebody out there somewhere wants to hire me---!!!! soon! hee hee  Posted by  urlLink Hello

      Kill Bill was actually pretty good. I liked it but I can't stand sequels to movies. They are never as good as the first and I hate waiting months for the next one to come out. By the time they come out, I've forgotten half of the plot of the first one.    Posted by  urlLink Hello

      I am completely stuffed!!! its one of those yum, im so stuffed and I just wanna sit back and watch a movie and not do anything kind of stuffed- not one of those- oh, i think i ate too much and am going to have a tummy ache one so thats good. pete and i went out to this indian restaurant we hadnt been to before and just pigged out. then we walked all the way to blockbuster and we were going to rent The Last Samuri- walked up to the counter and everything and.... i had forgotten my card and I also had Pete's card from the last time we went to BB, so we had to walk all the way back empty handed. How disappointing. So now I think Ill have to actually do some more work. Blah... Can you believe that I cant just give them my name and then rent the videos? They needed a pic id and i didnt bring my wallet out, so no luck there. oh well

      I got my grades back from my last project and I did pretty well. Was quite "chuffed" as everyone here says. My tutor said that my presentation was so strong and convincing that he thought i had come from a marketing background. NICE. anyway, just spent the last 3 hours working on my portfolio and it wasnt even a real portfolio, its just one done on powerpoint so that i can send it to prospective employers. I am quite happy with it, but i just need to change a few things. Oh and no it didnt take me 3 hours to set up the PP thing- I am fine with that, it was doing things on Adobe photoshop that took me so long. anyway, now back to my last project. I really cant wait for school to be through. to think that my evenings will actually be free- my own time -- sounds like paradise!!   oh- another good thing- it looks like ill be going to japan this summer!! yeah! im running out of my cosmetics anyway, and i only trust the japanese kind for my skin. so fun fun. lots of catching up with ppl and relatives. one of my friends is getting married!!!!

      So Pete and I are just sitting here having a lovely dinner when all of a sudden we hear a huge CRACK and look up to see that our bay window in the living room has a gigantic hole in the window!! Some f*&#nut must have thrown a rock through our window. Who the hell would do that to us? We have no friends or enemies in Luton! Everyone we hang out with live in London. Let me just tell you one thing. LUTON SUX!!! it is the worst place! Ha- so at least you guys wont want to come and visit me. Anyway, had a nice weekend in Sheffield. But I somehow managed to pull a muscle in my back and it hurts like shit!! So I dont know what to do and all i want is sympathy. What do you do for a pulled muscle?? Never had one before...

      well i just applied for two jobs today but im not holding my breath. one was for a company in London and another was for a company in Los Angelos. So what i really shouldve been doing was my work for my final project, but im thinking finding a job is a little more important. so pete informs me that our last day in this flat is july 13th! ok, thats only a little more than a month left. what are we going to do? hum... im supposed to have all this shit figured out by now, but of course things never happen like you plan so ive stopped planning. everyone says it will all fall into place, but i have yet to see that happen. i am waiting anxiously for my dream job to jump into my lap. i dont know whether to stay here in london with pete or go back to the states and get a job there. im so torn and have no clue. sometimes i just wish that someone would make up my mind for me--- because i change mine every second. for the time being, i guess just applying for jobs in london and the states will be good. but i just dont know. why give up a good thing when nothings wrong ya know? hmmm... lots to think about, but after doing some thinking over the past 9 months i havent come up with an answer so how will one more month give me the answer? yeah right.  well, its midnight. i have to get up tomorrow at 7 and commute 2 hours to school and work on my last project. fun fun.

      I just started checking out airline prices for a flight home and they start around $1200!! That is just insane! I was able to fly from London to Charlotte roundtrip for about $600 around Christmas and thats the busiest time of the year! How could the price jump up to 1200?? OMG... what am i going to do?? hmmm...

      Wow. it is gorgeous outside! Absolutely beautiful!... and i have to be inside drawing all day!! How annoying! I cannot wait for this project to be over. I have never done anything that consumes my life 24 hrs a day. I have already had so many dreams about this project- the presentation, the design. Isnt that crazy?  Oh, on the good side of things, I got an email from an interior design company in California who is interested in seeing my portfolio! Yeah! I would love to move to Cali- good weather, good food, and right by the ocean. Perfect! Keep your fingers crossed. I sent her my portfolio yesterday.
