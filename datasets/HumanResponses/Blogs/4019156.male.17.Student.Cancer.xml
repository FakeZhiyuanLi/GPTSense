      currently listening to devil in jersey city, by coheed n cambria  its all kinda funny when i think about it. i didnt know how much julie really liked me until just last night in jays car. i was never optimistic to hope it was that much. so when i finally figured out it was like gettin punched....a good punch though. n now shes in sea izle(isle) city. we were on the phone for almost 5 hours tonight/this morning though.  im actually thinking about alot of stuff right now....stuff i really cant formulate into works n make it make sence....  so any who...julies gettin back on sunday n im gonna be off work on sunday. i actually embeded a knife in my finger tonight at work. the funny part was having to pull it out of my finger, it almost went right down to the bone. so i pulled it out, asked my boss for a band aid....hell even he looked concerned. but i just kept on working. its not really infected, i just looked at it, it just itches alot. ok....i wonder off topic too much. when julie comes back im taking her out to dinner.....sadly shes gonna be the one whos driving. but hey...ill be paying. so its all good.

      currently listening too i'm lost without you, by blink 182   so i've been seeing julie every chance i get lately. today we hung out after she came back from dinner with her parents. it was me her n tara just chillin out n driving around. while we were gettin water ice we could see a thunder storm comming....one hell of a thunder storm too. the three of us sat around watching it. it had to be one of the most insane n memorable thunderstorms in my life. always lightening. always thunder..it never stoped. after the main part of the storm left tara fell asleep on a bench so me n julie just sat there n talked. it was about 11 when the storm started up again. n julies mom said i had to leave at 11 too. luckly julie was aloud to drive me home. so we pulled up at my house....n she put the tranny in park n she put the hand brake on. now if shes only dropping me off why would she put the hand brake on n the car in park? yea..i got the idea alright...right as i looked up her face was inches from mine....so i just closed the gap n tryed not to think that this was my first kiss in almost 2 months. it went well...but lets just say i was out of practice.   so now its almost 1 in the morning. jay is online n says he wants to stop by. im like sure, why not? so we are hanging out in my office talking n im talking online to julie. i tell her jays here. after a lil while she suggests that me n jay pick her up...cause she really wanted to see me since she'd be on vacation the rest of the week. we couldnt leave until 2:15 when everyone but her in her house was asleep. we parked in the church parking lot across the street. i see her coming...so i got out of shot gun n puts the front seat down n squizes in the back. she gets into the back seat...n i open my arms..n she fell right into them for the most part. we rode around for an hour...she was always in my arms n she was always holding onto me. i kissed her hair, n down her face, n then our lips met just like they had in her car earlier. it didnt even matter where we were goin. we just layed there in the back of the car content with just each other. the greatest thing about it was that it was like i had someone again. someone i could confide in n share my feelings with n love, n just hang out with n enjoy each others company. we both have just gotten out of busted relationships. so im sure she felt the same way.   all in all that was the best night i have ever had. the best car ride i ever had. n the shortest hour i ever had. its like this relationship between me n julie just jumped out of no ware. n now i cant get her out of my mind. cant get the pleasent smell of her hair out of my nose, n cant get the feeling of her holding onto me off my body. its amazing! it sucks so much that shes goin down to sea isle city till sunday. i hope she keeps herself bussy, cause atleats for my sake i got work every day from now till sunday. i guess the most bittersweet part of this is that me n julie finally discovered how we both feel about each other n what its like to be with each other..n now shes gonna be wisked away till sunday....dam!

DAM!     &nbsp;   i worked tonight. i have too boss's, ben n tommy, there brothers. they switch off every other week. so this week it was ben. n bens a prick...n an asshole. he's always joking around n making fun of everyone. he gets on my nerves most of the time cause im trying to work n hes making some joke at me about something or other having to do with my hair (long, blonde, n a lil curely). he calls me surffer dude...n i dont even surf! well tonight we was in a bad mood, i could tell. he made fun of almost all of us malicously. then my friend ed leaned over n told me that ben was a lil upset cause one of the best cooks brennan was caught drinking on the job. so i just let what ben go on what he was saying. but its a bummer cause brennans fun to work with, always has great music playing, can always make ya laugh, n he whips up some great food! i sure hope he isnt fired. that would end the fun every friday night. everyone loves this kid.     &nbsp;   haha....i just found out i work tommorow too....as in sunday...as in i worked on friday n saturday..n now sunday...as in i have no weekend this weekend. its a bitch. i wanted to see julie too. like really really bad. but hey, not till monday i guess. ill give her a call or something when she gets back from work. i wanna see how shes feeling after the "date" on thursday night. it might as well have been a date. it was just the 2 of us while jay n tara were screwing around. when i was talking to bethy i told her about julie. n she hopes it all works out for me. n hell, i hope so too     &nbsp;   probably gonna go to sleep soon. i wanna get up at about 12, so that i got some time before work. ya know, just a lil to hang out with someone or something.     &nbsp;   the bartender had a shirt on tonight that said its ignorant to spit......lol..i wonder what that means     &nbsp;   later!

      currently listening to Collapse, by Sparta  me n julie saw anchorman last night. that movie was so god dam terrible that it was fuckin  hilarous!!!! especially the part when ron burgandy n the chick he digs are making out in bed n she says take me to pleasure town. n then the screen changes n they actually show a place called pleasure town with rainbows and panda's, and all that shit. it was disgusting....disgustingly funny!   so...you would think the best part of a date would take place during the date right? WRONG! the best part of the date was deffidently after the date! me n julie were in the back of the car just kinda laying there (or atleast we tryed, its a pretty small car). jays just driving around for the hell of it. me n julie were just all over each other the whole time. if i was sitting in the passenger seat looking back i would describe what i saw as 2 people kissing like animals at first. but then it kinda slowed down, got a lil more passionate. i would open my eyes every now n then n all i would see was just her face illuminated by a street light every few seconds. our arms were around each other holding each other as close as we could. i dont no how long it lasted, but it was like being in heaven. i remember laying there for a bit, my arm around her waiste, she had her face in my neck n i was playing with her hair, n i remember thinking...i cant believe i have something like this again so soon. hell its better then what i ever had before. i wished me n her could just stay in each others arms forever, n i get the feeling that she felt the same way.

      currently listening to the boy who blocked his own shot, by brand new  wow, i woke up at 9 this morning. thats kind of a first. i guess im gettin my sleeping schedule back to normal. thats a dam good thing. so after i woke up i walked to the hotel to get some smokes. since thats how i give back to the bussiness tommy sells them to me since i've been to every other establishment in langhorne n need to be 18 to get smokes. then i met the day time dishwasher for the first time. that guy is a trip. hes mentally retarded, but not so much so that he cant do a simple lil job like washing dishes. hes nice to, a lil annoying, but brennan says ya get used to him. tommy asked me if i could work day shift next monday cause daves goin outta town. he gave me enough warning so i can do it for sure. then brennan went out for a smoke break n me n him talked for a bit till i was done n he was done. so i went home.   i took julie out for a dinner date a few nights ago. it was pretty good. i've been on a few dinner dates but this was her first. its good though cause we had fun sittin there talkin n eatin n all that. last night i had to stay home till 8 cause bob was bringing over his lawn mower since mine broke. but after that me julie tara n jay walked down to playwicki park. jay n tara got there own table in a pavilion. n me n julie got a bench. it was pretty romantic since it was pitch black n all we could hear were night time bugs n all that. thankfully jay n tara were out of sight n ear shot, so thats always a good thing knowing them. me n julie sat on that bench in each others arms for a surprising 2 hours. that time went pretty dam fast! i wouldnt have traded those 2 hours for anything at all either. it was just great! after a while i could see the light from jays cell phone over in the distance. so i told julie id be right back n i creeped up on jay n tara. i got right behind them n they had no idea i was there. they were just sitting there. so i fuckin grabbed there shoulders n let out a blood curdling scream. they were so fuckin startled! i was hilarous! tara screamed n jay yelped! then jay jumped over the table at me n we kinda beat the crap out of each other for a couple of minutes.   heres the bad luck part though. julies mom got made at her for being out so late. i cant see julie till thursday cause shes grounded for a few days. its a pretty big bitch if ya ask me. but atleast ill be working tommorow night so i wouldnt have seen julie anyway. but still!  im starting to think im in love with her. im glad i spent the time to get to know her before anything happened. cause now its paying off that i actually know her pretty well n she knows me pretty well. the problem though, n this is a problem with me not her, is that im afraid to do something like saying i love her, cause thats a form of comitmet. n last time i did that i got my heart smashed into the ground. (sorry, didnt mean to be too emo with that). so its like im just down right afriad. i dont want another repeat of what happened before. my mind always wonders into the worst case scenerio. so i always end up thinking like this nowadays. i guess all i can do is sit there n wait for the right time, or the right event, or that kinda thing. i dont no, id sure like some ideas on what i should do. that would be great.
