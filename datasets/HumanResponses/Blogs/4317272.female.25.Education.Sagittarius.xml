      Okay.  Here it goes.  I would have blogged earlier today, but it is Tuesday, and I have a new mother's group on Tuesdays.  Afterwards we go out for lunch.  Usually we talk about things that are babies are doing - brag moments, we call them.  Each week is a different topic - something baby like.  Anyway, I have been giving Aidan formula since he was about 6 weeks old.  I started breast feeding, but he was feeding all the time, for 1-1 1/2 hrs. at a time.  Needless to say, I decided that I wanted a life, so I chose to stop breast feeding and offer a bottle.  Since then, he has now started solids (some cereal & some vegetables).  He loves it.  He was ready for it, even though you are supposed to wait until 6 months.  Today, one of the other moms decided to ask some questions about starting solids.  She wanted to know when was the best time, what to give, etc.  (We already did this topic 3 weeks ago!)  Anyway, most of the mothers in our group are breastfeeding.  Cudos to them.  I couldn't do it for that long.  During the discussion today someone said that they didn't want to start giving their son solids because he seemed "pure" to her.  Everything he had ever eaten had been from her.  She didn't want him to have formula or solids which contain, god forbid, canola oil.  She said this as if it was a drug or something.  (By the way, most people will eventually have to eat real food, which contains canola oil & other things.  She can't breast feed forever.)Anyway, it really annoyed me because it seemed like she was saying that only breast milk was good.  The truth is, I do not care what anyone else does with their baby.  In the end, I am happier, Aidan is happier.  This is the most important thing.  But I feel that the trend is to tell women that they SHOULD breast feed (heavy on the should) and if they don't, they are somehow cheating their baby of the best there is to offer.  The truth is that it is up to you.  You need to do what is right for you and your baby.  Sure, God created the breast for feeding your baby, but God also created your baby & your baby usually knows what it needs.  YOU as a mother know best what YOUR baby needs.  TRUST YOUR INSTINCTS!  I am just telling you this because I wish someone else had said this to me before I had had Aidan.  But, they mostly told me to breast feed.  Mostly, you need to love your baby.  He/She will thrive on that love.  God will protect them.  Thanks for letting me vent.  Love, Manders

       Well, this is my first blog. I am sure that everyone says that at the beginning. So much for originality. Oh well.  Being a stay at home mom, with our almost 5 month old, means that I do not get a lot of time to see other adults, talk with them, etc. I guess this is going to become my outlit for venting and feeling like I am a whole person again.  It is funny, but when you become a mom, you begin to look at things in a whole new way. Instead of thinking about yourself and what you want and need, you have to think about another person. Questions change from what am I going to do today, to what is my sons mood going to be; when will he eat; what will he need; etc. It is nice to be needed so much. It is nice to think of another person before yourself. It puts life into perspective.  I guess it is God using my son to teach me to practice Philippians 2:3-4: "Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility consider others better than yourseves. Each of you should look not only to your own interests, but also to the interests of others. "  This is such an important part of my life right now. I guess each blog will probably bore you with thoughts about my son (Aidan) and what he is doing. I guess I should have called this Aidans brag blog. But, I chose Mountain Peak because I hope that it gives you all a place to come, read and enjoy, just like a mountain peak. I also love the mountains.     My key verses for this blog is Micah 4:1-5 which talk about The Mountain of the Lord. On it we will all be together, getting along with each other, nation with nation, man with man. War will be over. Specifically verse 2: "Many nations will come land say, 'Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob. He will teach us his ways, so that we may walk in his paths.'"  May you find rest and restoration today in your walks of life.  Love, Manders
