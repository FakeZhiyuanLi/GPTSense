      Wednesday 18/8 2004 Chapter 21: My killer arm Ha ha i got like half of your team out in kick ball. and i killed some people in T3 too. P.E is the best subject, no difficult thinking required and i really love that we can throw and kick stuff around and stay on task at the same time. it was the first PE class Molly's taken since he had his little girl. see ya. Tomarse,  Thursday 19/8 Chapter 22: stayin home I was really tired today so i stayed home. I was up all night watching the Olympics and I went and played the computer after that and my dad walked in and said "your up early" yeh it was about 5:00am. so at like 2:00pm i got up and worked for a few hours at the toy shop.  Friday 20/8 Chapter 23: yay the end of the week! Yet another impressive sporting display from super Tomarse in hockey with 4 goals, the rest of the team did a bit of work but i carried them to victory. I rule! stupid Phedra! Hack my ankles! and the rest of the time it was either mucking around in Italian or listening to music in music elective and a bit of work here and there. Lachlan decided to stick to basketball because hes too dangerous in hockey he swings to high and gets sent off all the time. Tom,  Saturday 21/8 chapter 24: Me old lady's b'day Just an average Saturday working at the shop...Yawn and it my mums birthday so i gotta go see all my rellies on her side of the family tonight....Bunch of drunks....a little harsh but they do get through a lot of champaign so they also tend not to notice if a glass or two go missing here and there.....um the dog drank it mum! i completely forgot my mums birthday and i had absolutely nothing to give her. it was the same with my dad. I suck at remembering birthdays.  Sunday 22/8 chapter 25: More Pirated DVD's! Yay we got Man on fire, Garfield and Spider man 2 on Dvd but no cd's this week. I hate those adds at the movies eg: you wouldn't steel a movie, you wouldnt steel a hand bag, you wouldn't steel a T.V then dont download pirated movies ....Piracy is steeling. It's just like sharing movies the only reason they have those adds is because they dont want to loose money! and if my uncle the Church minister pirates dvd's it cant be that bad! so i tend to ignore the adds. In fact i used to have my own Pirating business with my cousin we burnt playstation games, Dvd's, Vcd's and music cd's and we only got caught once and we were able to run away. we made about 300 bucks each.......True story.

As i lie on the floor nearly unconcious he ran down the stairs grabbed a funnel from the cupboard and placed it in my mouth then he got the orange juice out of the fridge and held my nose while pouring the orange juice down the funnel!....for someone watching it it would have been really funny. i coughed it up all over the floor and he stole my pen from my pocket and ran back up the stairs. when i got off the floor i went up stairs to get my pen back and he through the over shoe at me so i ran back to the kitchen got a lemon and as he was peering over the side rail of the stairs i piffed the lemon and it hit him Cleen between the eyes and exploded on his head.  when i got home i realised that not only had he pick pocketed my pen but he had stolen my wallet!

      Wednesday 4/8 2004 chapter 8: The epic adventure of the century!  Finally! we had sport today and we played skittle ball, Le crosse and Terminator 1 and 2 and i Kicked ass! im so great im fabulous im terrific im so incredible away with not using correct spelling and grammar on my Web log! no but really i kicked at sport today with skittle ball i got tons of people out, in le cross i got tons of points and in terminator i was sprinting for the whole time. After sports we had English and i didnt do much work so i have to make up for it at home but the topic of conversation that lesson was interesting. And finally music was ok but im still there as im writing so it might take a dive or something i'll report back later. Yeh it was ok BYE BYE! XXX000 my addoring fans! (unless your a guy).  Thursday 5/8 2004 Chapter 9: Garbo duty!  Today i had garbo duty...thats a good thing incase you don't know. All i have to do is walk around the school talking to your fellow garbo and you miss Periods 3+4 and 5 which in my case were the worst subjects of the day! Maths (BORING!) and Science (BORING!) but i chose to attend Multimedia which is were i am now! so you can tell i dont have to do much work because im just mucking around on the net. When i look around i see degenerates playing video games, disruptors walking and talking and then i turn my head to my right and see all the 8s students who have already finished there work (including me!) and are currently doing whatever they like meanwhile the rest will fail! And our teachers say we muck around too much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I gotta go to Tennis see yas all! Friday 6/8 2004 chapter 10: cbf'ed I CBF'ed writing t'day so see ya!  Saturday 7/8 2004 chapter 11: this mays well be chapter 10!  As usual i had to work today and i stacked shelves, worked the register, looked after the baby and chased theives!yawwwwwnnnn! After that I just watched all the games on T.V and i didnt like 2/3 of the results! Carlton def Essendon...exploitive deleted Wallabies def All blacks...YAY! haha Meg and josh kangaroos def Sydney... Bugger! now Essendon slip to 9th! And after that i just watched horror movies on channel 7 they were pretty gruesome and violent but i dont care iv seen worse. It was about a secretive luxury ship for the high society that sails through the ocean with casino's and swimming pools and all kinds of things on board and they sailed over an uncharted part of ocean and something hits the ship from beneath and drinks the fluids out of all the guests. meenwhile a ship of multicultured terrorists is on a small boat filled with nukes and torpedos and they plan to attack the ship. they arrive at the ship and they find an empty ball room with blood all over the floor and all the money is still at the tables so they know its not a robery and then they split up to find everyone. one group finds some survivors in the control room then one group are attacked by the monster and it splats their blood everywhere. They run into a tubey monster and shoot a hole in it and a half devoured comrad squeezes out of it screaming and making gargling noises, then he turns to the side and his brain is popping out of his head and his pus is pouring out of the tubey monster and showers everyone with it...i told you it was gruesome didnt I? and then he collapses then the monster swallows him again and they run. The monster kills them off one by one until there is only 4 left (there was originally 15) but if i told you how the rest of them died you would probably throw up ! they discover that the monster senses people by hearing and they walk really quietly up to the tube and plant a grenade in it and when the grenade went off it attacked itself and they were ablr to escape in one of the dingys and they leave all the bombs on board and when they get far enough away they detonate them! all the monsters yellow pus and blood fly up into the sky and one long tentacle extends straight up into the sky and they all gasp as it reaches upwards about 200 metres. when they get back they discover that it is the reason why the ocean is uncharted and it has been alive for hundreds of years devouring ships full of people and it was a really gross film. see ya!  sunday 8/8 2004 chapter 12: HW...yawwn  I slept in till 12:30 then watched the footy for like 4 hours and then did hw....thats it. oh and i watched "oceans elevin" on channel 9 and then "cobra" after that. yaaaaaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwwwwwwnnnnnnnnnnn! i think i'll go sleep now.  monday 9/8 2004 chapter 13: Pearsons dictatorship.  Today in sose we had a good laugh as the following events occured: 1: I hid behind a table at the start of the lesson and was told to sit down(thats not the funny part) 2: i was told i wouldn't be able to participate in the class discussion because i coughed too loudly! 3: i was yelled at and told to move because someone who will remane nameless was kicking my chair! 4: i was told that i was going to be awarded 3 strikes and a detention for sitting down next to the heater when she told me to move to the back row (the heater is in the back row) 5:she threatned that she was going to tell mr. Beale that i was vandalising the heater when i hadn't actually come into any physical contact with it! And at the end of the class she held me back and went on about being disruptive and stupid when if she hadn't pointed out all my imaginary mistakes the class wouldn't have been stopped ! afterwards the whole class was laughing at her behind her back and they all said how outrageous her accusations were. so i feel happy that i have people on my side at least. thanx people! bye bye.  Tuesday 10/8 2004: The OC  Yay tonight the oc is on! thats pretty much all i have to look forward to today so i might finish there. Congratulations to Meg,Chloe and Kylie for being accepted to Mcrob im sure everyone in 8s will miss you. Wednesday 11/8 2004:coming soon....

      Thursday 28/7 2004 Chapter 2: Tennis I play tennis after school for hours and its extremely tiring i play until quarter past 7. After tennis I get home and watch TV thats why i was considering naming all the chapters boring and then naming the weekend chapters semi-boring and the holidays would be exceptions. School was ok i supose except we had a boring maths test in the 1st and 2nd periods in which mr.Arayne persisted to blame me for talking to other students when i didnt! In fact when he doesnt say anything im usually doing exactly that.  Friday 29/7 2004 Chapter 3: Northern lights is boring!  Today we did sex ed and i had to listen to peter giggling through the whole thing. I meen how was i suposed to know that an osama style beard wasnt normal for a mans facial hair and so i drew it on the sheet and it looked really stupid...JUST LIKE OSAMA BIN LADEN!but seriously though bagging terrorists is the cheepest form of comedy there is because its so easy. They all look so stupid if you just show the audience a picture of one they'll kack there pants and another one is poo jokes. All you have to do is say a definition of poo in a funny voice or in a sentence with terrorists and the audience will bring the joke to life! (kack themselves once more)Period 3+4 were good though i just downloaded music and movies from the computers the whole time while the teacher delt with the trouble makers, which would normally meen me but im not stupid enough to get in trouble in a computer class. And the rest of the day was boring. On the tram home i realised that northern lights is boring and im just gonna listen to the cassette tapes from now on.Im so over books they suck. And so ends the 3rd boring day of my boring blog.  Saturday 30/7 2004 chapter 4: workin at the shop  Today im working at the toy shop which is what i'v been doing every Saturday for about a year and a half.  My job is basically to price new stock, stack shelves, work at the register and to entertain my boses baby usually with hide and seek but he always wins because he always go's under the shelves and suprises me and yeh i know its kinda stupid loosing to a 15 month old baby in a game of hide and seek but he really is good at it. Today during work some kids came into the shop trying to steel stuff so my boss told me to wait at the door and get them to turn out there pocketsI felt like a bouncer or something. They started crying because they didnt want us to tell there parents what they'd done i kinda felt sorry for them but we told there parents and they came in with a bag of stuff that there kids had stolen over the last few months and they said sorry and blah blah blah and they weren't going to do it again. how dramatic.....NOT! well at least im living up to my boring blog standards eh? After work i went to Christo's b'day party which i was supposed to be dressed as Quote: a dark knite or an evil night dwelling beast :unquote. But i wasnt in the mood for embarissing myself with nerdy costumes so i just went casual.  when i got there they were playing with swords in the front yard.........ok these are the kids that i would have bashed if i was a bully in primary school, so i started playing cricket with my sword using a toy goblins head for a ball and they got pissed at me because I hit it really hard out onto Hope street and a car ran over it,i laughed but afterwards i found out it was a piece of 'Warhammer' and that little piece of plastic was worth about $30 so i left...Fewf!  AFTER THIS ABNORMALLY NERDY PARTY I REALISED WHY PEOPLE BAG ME FOR PLAYING WITH YUGIOH CARDS AND IM REALLY DISCOURAGED FROM THEM NOW, I THINK I'LL SELL THEM. THIS IS CAPTAIN TOMARSE OF THE QUANTUM GALAXY NERD PATROL SIGNING OFF!... BECAUSE IM BORED!  Sunday 1/8 2004 chapter 5:Go the bombers!  Last night the mighty Essendon bombers conquered Port Adelaide in a really great game of footy! the bombers started to slip away in the last quarter but then ran away with it in the end by about 32 points. speakin of run away thats what i felt like doing on friday night when Adelaide and the Kangaroos stank out the southern hemisphere with there incredible show of cheapness, I meen i haven't seen a worse game of footy in more than 3 years and i was watching StKilda 2 years ago! only 2 goals in the 1st half of the game! thats shocking. im really tired today so im gonna sleep,watch footy and write some blogging you wanna know why im so tired...well i'll to ya anyway! i stayed up to watch the late late movie on channel 9 last night and thats no typo it was later than the late movie! in fact it went in this order: the late movie, the late show with David Letterman and then the late late movie and i drank loads of coffee so i could stay up and watch it (even though it wasnt that good i was just bored) and my hands were shakin like crazy it was like a Playstation controller when you get shot in Medal of Honor (i dont expect many of you to understand that) and thats all folks! the end of Bugs bunnys 4th blog chapter!  Monday 2/8 2004 Chapter 6 : damn school make me do work!  Monday...Damn back to boring school, thats what i hate about weekends... they end! And i bet anyone who's reading this is nodding and saying something like "yeh tell me something i dont know" or "school is were i would kill myself if i was suicidal". Today was a pretty lowsy day because i felt like playing sport or running around and that didnt happen, first the boring maths test,then the double science "boredom 101"yawwwnnn! but I cant really say anything bad about english for two reasons one is that Ms Rose will read this and two because it wasnt that bad, but Sose wow that sucked even though we only had to sit through 35 minutes of it because everyone took it upon themselves to be late (including myself) but the lesson was just a half hour discussion about why we are willingly late. But the rest of the day was ok because me and Lachlan decided to show up at bens house and play gamecube for a few hours until Ben kicked us out. Thats about it. Well im sorry my life isnt more interesting but im doing the best i can ok!!!oh and im making it trdition to mention the word "Boring' in every outro so in closing this was just another boring day in the life of BOB um i meen Tom...Damn you figured out my Alias NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!! oh wait i can erase that cant i here ill try this button here it says "publish post" maybe that will delete my stupidity??? hey wait why am i writing my thoughts??? oh well atleast publish post will delete it all.  tuesday 3/8 2004 chapter 7: I know that last joke seems retarded but there was nothing else in my small brain.  Im a terrible comedian not even GMA could hire me now and there pretty lame! Today was another horrible day except for perhaps Lachlans entertaining sose presentation which consisted of micheal Jackson impressions, Frysey impressions and not much intelingent information at all oh and science was a fun lesson (only because the teacher was absent!) we just talked, read books and some people looked at photos of rachels thighes on Rebeccas picture phone...dont ask why because im stumped. On the whole this day was kinda crappy, but after school i went with Frank, Liam,ian,the other Liam and this girl that tagged along to the milk bar and it was my shout...That isnt so bad i spose i do have pretty deep pockets and im the only one with a job at the moment so its pretty fair. This is Uncle Tomby saying THE END....WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR GO HOME! YOU DAMN LONERZ!...lol. Chapter 8 the epic adventure of the century...coming soon!
