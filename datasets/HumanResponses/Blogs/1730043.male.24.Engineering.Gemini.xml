      Dare you to Move  The Switchfoot concert in Milwaukee was great.  After experiencing the music, show, and watching their video on there website, I am motivated to get up when I am feeling lazy and pursuing what really matters.  It is time I move against the flow of this world that I do not belong to and start running toward the things that have eternal instead of temporal value.  Jesus is the answer.  Nothing but the grace and relentless love of Christ.  We cannot earn it, we just have to accept it.   urlLink Switchfoot
