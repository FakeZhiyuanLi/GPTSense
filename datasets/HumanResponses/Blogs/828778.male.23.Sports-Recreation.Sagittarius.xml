        You mean the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court didn't see this coming?    Mere days after gay marriages started happening here in Massachusetts,  urlLink a wife filed suit  against the medics who treated  her  wife, under a "loss of consortium" statute after she developed breast cancer (To review, wife A sues clinic because of alleged malpractice which happened to wife B). This shouldn't surprise anyone in the United States: any substantial change to existing law yields lots of tort law cases. For the un-initiated tort law = I sue you for money because I can, regardless of the validity of my case. If I can convince a jury you "hurt me", you  gots  to pay. Tort law is good when you get screwed by a guy who cheated you in a contract. It's bad when the woman down the street sues you because your kid plays basketball and the noise causes her "emotional distress."  Now I'm going to lay out my position on gay marriage after what I hope are some fair historical basics. Early in the history of Western Civilization marriage was solely conferred by the Church. Marriage carried with it several "common law" restrictions, priviledges, etc. Over time, after the United States was founded and freedom of religion became pervasive, the Church was pushed out of the civil sphere and governments began to confer many different kinds of civil priviledges on a traditionally religious institution. Ergo, not too long ago you applied for a license to get married with the state and then got married by a preacher/religious figure of some kind. The church wouldn't recognize your marriage if it wasn't done by a priest and the state wouldn't recognize your marriage unless it was licensed by the state. However, at some point in our society my guess being the late '60s early '70s, the church lost even more of its domain over marriage and people began to be married only by civil judges. A marriage might have lost some of its religious legitimacy, but it was still a marriage in the eye of state and in the eye of the participants. To review: marriage went from purely religious, to both religious and civil, back to mostly civil.  At about the same time, people in the United States began to feel that life was about fullfilling the self. A career to pursue is one that makes you happy, doing some drugs are ok as long as I don't hurt anyone, essentially anything that you do that doesn't hurt anybody else is ok. So, after the queer community received its social exceptance in the mid-90s, gay people felt like being discriminated against simply being who they are, should be illegal. As long as they hurt no one, they should have the full rights of everyone else. And rightly so, according the U.S. Constitution. However, the big mess got started when the queer community felt it was entitled to marriage like everyone else. It's a big mess because marriage in the U.S. is at the rare nexus of both civil and religious authority. Marriage is historically a religious or personal institution, but because of our history it has civil priviledges. I say priviledges because marriage is not a right. Voting is not a right. Free speech is a right. Government is  very limited  in how it can restrict speech, but the state can and has restricted driving, veterans rights, voting, and who can and under what conditions can get married. First cousins can not be married, under-aged youth can not be married, etc. Yes, this reasoning applies to historical but eventually illegal restrictions on inter-racial marriage, but the point here is that marriage has always been a heavily regulated civil priviledge--not a right as many pro-gay marriage advocates argue. But since pro-gay marriage advocates follow the philosophy of self-fullfillment, "since I grew up dreaming of the day I would fall in love and marry, and because this hurts no one, this should be legal regardless of who I want to marry and love, be they man or woman."  And I do not dissagree with them. Gays and Lesbians should be able to marry whomever they like. They should be able to enter into the civil contract that is marriage. Despite the fears of many on the religious Right, this does not necessarily destroy traditional marriage. I also dissagree that gay-marriage puts a big crack in this traditional institution. Let's be honest, marriage has already lost most of its gravitas when you could get married in Vegas in a drive-through or when you could get divorced for almost any reason whatsoever as long as it was "irreconcileable." The gay marriage conflict exists because anti-gay marriage advocates believe marriage to be the domain of churches and religion(s) many of whom proscribe against homosexuality. Yet, obviously marriage has existed outside the churches for decades. However, gay-marriage advocates fail to recognize the pandoras' box they've opened. Marriage law never recognized "love" or "want" as part of the marriage contract, for the most part only a bride and a groom of age. For gay-marriage advocates they've only argued in favor of homosexual couples be able to recieve the priviledges and protections of civil marriage. But now marriage has lost its gender-contraints and indeed all others since the Mass. Supreme Judicial Court decision has set a precedent of only "want" to get married. Two heterosexual widows can now get married to merely enjoy the civil priviledges of marriage. A brother and sister can get married. I can marry my best friend so that we can share dental-insurance coverage or to inherit his college of vindage video games.  Ultimately, as far as U.S. law is concerned, I'm in favor of gay couples having the priviledges that straight couples enjoy, but that is becaue I see how civil marriage should be seperated from religious marriage and that good families come in many non-traditional forms. As far as social consequences and social policy is concerned, however, I must argue that there  must be  real reasons for why men and women were the traditional marriage  even in cultures that accepted, condoned, and promoted homosexual relationships , such as Ancient Greece. Most if not all successful civilizations in history have employed the female-male pair-bond/marriage paradigm for the production and development of human offspring. (Yes, a rare few have been polygamous or polyandrous and here I define "successful" civilizations as having lasted long enough for there to be a significant historical/archeological record.) Lastly, I have grave reservations for the method by which gay-marriage advocates have won their victory. Unlike the civil rights activists of the 60's that they desperately compare themselves to, a judicial decision was not followed or preceeded by a winning-over of the majority of the electorate or the Congress.  Brown v. Board of Education  was a landmark case against majority opinion, but it was followed by the Civil Rights Act of '64. The argument that blacks and whites should be equal under the law gained momentum and won over the masses. So far, gay-marriage has had its support level off or wain in the polls. Lastly, unlike human skin tones, there is a  substantive difference  between the union of two men or two women to that of a man or a woman; only the latter can physically produce a healthy human offspring (with out the aide of modern science.) My dissapproval of gay-marriage as it has been achieved so far stems from the fact that they won over 4 non-elected judges. Not a majority of the elected representatives of Massachusetts, and certainly not the majority of Massachusetts citizens. For such a controversial issue, I think we should have the most Constitutionally legitimate source as the fount of social resolution: if not the electorate as a whole, at least the legislature. Sadly in making their decision, the slim majority of the Supreme Judicial Court in Massachusetts has established itself as a tyrannical body writing rather than adjudicating the law; and as a result the gay-marriage lobby has lost the democratic high-ground.

       Another insight into my feelings on the Red Sox, taken from an email   I don't have any specific plans to be in Hanover this august, indeed my only plans are to continue the aforementioned training and watch nearly every single red sox game from now until late october. (I've watched 28/30 so far) I'll put it this way: should the red sox win the world series this october---and they just might---my death in marine corps fatigues in some jungle or desert a year from now won't be as tragic as it might be, as far as I'm concerned.

       I'm trying this again.   Where to begin? Right now I'm 3 sheets to the wind having spent some quality time with my friend Mr. John Daniel, watching Fight Club. That's probably as good an insight as any into my life.  A little less than a year ago, I graduated from college. Here I sit, nearly a year later and I have very little to show for time I've spent since. What I do have is a goal: I'm planning on getting a commission in the Marine Corps. What's funny is that the last time I (tried to) start(ed) a blog, I was applying for a commission in the U.S. Navy. This is the point where I tell you that despite my life-time repudation to the contrary, I really screwed up while I was at college. I managed to get  terribly mediocre grades . Let that be a lesson to you y'all who are still in school and can do something about your immediate futures.   This reminds me of a story.  It was Spring Break 2002 and I was in Houston Texas, staying at the home of a retired alumn. Over many a glass of scotch and bourbon, of which my host did not partake, Mr. Rice told me how he spent his time in Hanover mostly drunk, singing, and chasing tail. Having graduated with a "gentleman's C" he went to a large state law school, practiced and when I met him had a huge home, a lovely wife, and now consulted part-time for businesses and his old lawfirm.  I guess what I'm trying to say is that I graduated with a "gentleman's B-" and I'm not going to let that stop me from getting on with my life. That's where the marine corps comes in. There, I'm hoping I can recoup my professional competitiveness and discipline. Yes, I'm risking my life. Yes, there's a chance I can be killed. Yes, I'm an only child and a soft one at that. But as you'll learn, my ideas of good foreign policy and manhood are more in line with the heroes of Republican Rome than they are with your typical college kid. And so we've come full circle. What I did manage to retain at college only confirms my desire to serve.  So, here we go: while I juggle long-term goals of fullfillment, I try to get some sort of short-term foothold on life. Part of me just wants to move the F**** out of my house. I currently weigh in at 245 lbs. I need to weigh about 200lbs for the Corps. I've lost 35lbs so far. It's on.

       It's not personal, Sonny. It's strictly business.   Words of wisdom from one of my favorite movies. I went to see  Still We Believe: The Boston Red Sox Movie  today with my friend Daina, who I hadn't seen since a weekend in Times Square back in early '99. (That weekend is for another post) I had my fears and reservations about this movie, but I was surprised with how well it was done and how enjoyable it was. Rather than follow the team, the documentary actually followed the fans. Something that isn't clear even among my favorite sportstalk guys at  urlLink WEEI . The fan who got the most pub from this movie was "Angry Bill" a horribly negative and cynical fat guy, and deservedly so.  He is everything a Red Sox fan should not be . Despite allegedly being a fan, he simply had no faith and was more obsessed with his own suffering and a fatalistic view of the team. Daina and I found ourselves yelling "kill yourself" at him when he appeared onscreen. Yet if he is the yin, then the yang is what makes Red Sox fans some of the best sportsfans on the planet. They always hope and have faith that one year will be our year. They don't dissappear from fenway during a losing season, or after several, and they care, scrutinize, and argue over every move on and off the field.  The documentary itself was well done by my documentary standards. It was far more organized and far less preachy than the good Mr. Michael Moore's more critically acclaimed works--a man doesn't fail to appear in his own films to interview his subjects and then cut/edit his film to put his subjects' comments in a less than positive light. Surely it wasn't his politics that gave him the edge at Canness...hmmm...Anyways, director Paul Doyle, Jr. weaved the story of a few "case-study" Red Sox fans in with the ups and downs of last season, and showed them as they are, with no editorializing, which I feel is the strength of the documentary as a form of film.

       They Asked for the Storm [UPDATED below]  Over at  urlLink [Mis]adventures in the World of Dating , junior contributor Madeleine and her best friend Michelle composed a SHP (Standard Hookup Protocol). My comments were too long to put there, so I decided to post them here. Here were their "guidelines":   PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT. 1. We don't really need to make out for an hour. Stick in already. 2. Foreplay does not need to consist of the vertical approach. You ALL know what I mean. A girl's body is not a series of checkpoints. I know what you are all thinking. Mouth - 5 minutes. Move to ears. 2 minutes. Move to boobs. 5 minutes. Proceed to oral sex for a far too short period, become bored, stick it in. We propose a more varied route. 3. Overrated: boobs. Underrated: fingering. 4. Sex does not need to last hours. When we are looking skyward and biting our lips, we are NOT having a good time.  5. Invest in a ceiling with tiles, so we can count them while you try for a new world record for longest shag. We'll thank you later. 6. If we have condoms on hand, that does not make us sluts. If we ask you which size condom you need, that MIGHT make us sluts, but don't let it keep you up at night. 7. Be funny. Sex is supposed to be fun. Forgive random noises. It's your fault for insisting on weird positions. If you like a sterile, serious sexual experience, throw on some Dave Matthews, close your eyes, and crawl on top. Of a virgin. Laugh a little more, we like it. 8. Learn how to unhook a bra. We're all adults now, for pete's sake. 9. Correct order of clothing removal: shirt, pants, bra, underwear. Don't take off our bra while our pants are still on - it makes us feel like shirtless construction workers. Socks, you're on your own. Just take them off. 10. Porn. We like it. Jenna Jameson preferred.   Well, first of all, this list seems geared towards the DNWRG (Drunken Night with Random Guy) rather than a date that is gonna go somewhere. If that is the case, then it would follow that 1) If a guy's drunk/horny enough, then this shouldn't be a problem. If he doesn't know he's just here for tonight, maybe this info would help him know to cut to the chase 2) A concern with variety of foreplay seems inconsistent with "stick in already." If it's more oral sex you want, get a boyfriend who has incentive to work down there 3) Guys are only interested in the sex or your boobs. Fingers are for quality time by yourself. Sorry, this is not going to change. 4) Efforts to make sex last longer are a result of one of two things, either a) social pressure from women constaintly complaining of unsatisfying sex before Joe Random Guy gets his or b) it might be the rare drunken functionally erect penis, but hours of pounding isn't going to get things done. In this latter case, it's a guys responsiblility to take himself out of the game. But in the former, give your man a heads up if you're a 3-poke-and-done kinda girl, or if he needs to scrub in. 5) Like 4, the basic problem here is that this springs from the general complaint women have of all interactions with men. We can't read your minds. Communicate with your Random Guy. 6) A random guy you're about to have sex with has a hang-up that you have condoms? Frankly, he should be more worried about you  not  having condoms. And forget all the anxiety about being judged.  You're sluts, the both of you and it's ok.  7) If you want fun sex, hookup with a guy who you're into because he's funny. You're not gonna get fun sex with a guy you brought home because of the size of his wallet, ehem, penis. 8) You can't be serious. A man can't get your bra undone and this kills the momentum? Again, we're men. We have good gross motor skills, not fine. Hell, I even worked at Victoria's Secret and I have trouble from time to time. Frankly, if a guy can smoothly undue your bra with one hand, then maybe you should be worried he's on the job. 9) All of this concern over the order of clothing removal and "stick in already" are horribly inconsistent. If we're gonna get straight to the sex, we're not going to worry about how you feel as the clothing comes off. 10) What the hell is this? You'll have to be more explicit, pardon the pun. How does this work? You stumble into his/your apartment, he's fumbling with your bra, and you want him to quickly throw on the tv/computer and put on some porn? How the hell is that standard? Also, Jenna, though the benchmark of the industry, is a bit plastic. Check out Avy Scott.   UPDATE   It has come to my attention that Madeleine/Michelle's original SHP was not intented to address only random/drunken hookups but all hookups in general, even with girlfriends. That being the case, allow me to adjust my critique as briefly as possible.   1) This has been addressed enough elsewhere, but I believe, from what has been said, is that the length of making out should be tailored to the individual hookup. Feel out her pace. 2) Any man still operating on this particular schedule needs to move beyond the "baserunning" of grade/highschool. Ergo, agreed. 3) I guess y'all will never understand the draw of boobs, so a compromise: we play with the boobs  while we finger . 4/5) This doesn't change, there are reasons for why men try to lengthen the time of the experience, the solution isn't a blanket statement but more communication from both parties. 6) I stand by my initial statement vis-a-vis a random or consistent non-relationship hookup, but if a girlfriend has condoms, obviously she isn't a slut--she's just sharing the responsiblility of avoiding disease/pregnancy. (Also let me be clear: I don't use the word slut in any pejorative or judgemental sense. I wasn't explicit above, I meant both parties are sluts, ie the guy and the girl. I was certainly a slut in college. My point was one shouldn't care about being judged. Any fear of social condemnation or moral guilt should be a sign you're not truly comfortable with your behavior--and that isn't healthy.) 7) In general, I agree. 8) Let's keep it simple. Men should do their best, but please appreciate men's lack of fine motor skills and that we simply can't compete with a female's level of experience in this regard.  We don't wear bras . 9) My suspicion is that this seems to be the authors', not necessarily everygirl's, preferred order of clothing removal, because I could envision a hot/passionate encounter where the order of it coming off would be irrelevant, no? Unless Madeleine/Michelle are citing female consensus here that I haven't seen. 10) Whether a random girl or my girlfriend wants to see porn during/before/after the hookup, I still think this needs more explaining.  Regarding  Anonymous ' comments, men  should care  about the enjoyment of their girl during hooking up.  My critique was made in the most general sense towards the SHP, not any sort of statement or reflection of my own game, nor statements specifically directed at the authors.  I apologize for not making that clear. I refer you to the line in my original commentary, "this list seems geared towards the DNWRG (Drunken Night with Random Guy) rather than a date that is gonna go somewhere. If that is the case, then it would follow that ..." [emphasis added]. My assumption was in error, but my thoughts were based on it. Also, I was not as successful as I would have liked to have been in adding some levity to the discussion. I was hoping the line about a guy stumbling into a room, struggling with a bra and rushing to put porn on would have gotten some smiles and maybe a laugh, but I digress. Lastly, on a personal note, I do not think myself a sex god, never have. I'm merely a student of the game, always looking to compete and to improve--hence my interest in the subject.   Ultimately, the general thrust, ehem, of my commentary was that this SHP is not standard, nor is it any sort of protocol. It reads more like a list of recommendations and pet peeves from the female (and specifically the authors') point of view--or worse, a quiz from cosmo. For example, my girlfriend would probably flip out if I put on porn during a hookup (she's decidedly far more old-fashioned than some of my previous girlfriends who have broached the subject of porn).   I think I should thank Madeleine/Michelle for getting this ball rolling. A collaberative attempt at a SHP that will address both genders is in the works. I will be working on it with Isa over at  urlLink The Domino Effect . Look for it there in a coming post.

       This Queer Eye for the Straight Guy crap has to stop   Why the hell does anything on tv that appeals to women and gay men, builds up a lot of media-hype, has to lay claim to some sort of social phenomenon?? I don't know of a single man who watches  Queer Eye  or who watched  Sex in the City  and men in my demographic make up the vast majority of tv-viewership! Why am I subjected to some hyper-gay man pitching me a goldfish cracker?   On a deeper level, straight men  used  to be well-groomed and dressed properly...then there was that social change in the late 60s and 70s when everyone became a cool hippie, much more casual and no one wanted to be a square. There is nothing necessarily gay about being on top of your game as a guy, showing some effort about your appearence, hygiene or your home. Oh, and metrosexual is just another term for an overly vain and effeminate guy---what woman wants a man more vain and obsessed with his appearence than she is?    urlLink THEY ARE CRAB PEOPLE. TASTE LIKE CRAB, TALK LIKE PEOPLE .  What happened to manhood? I'll post on this again and in depth later.

       I Hate Fake Boobs   Anybody who knows me knows that I am a fan of the female form, but I've recently come to hate  urlLink fake boobs . Some of you women out there might applaud and some guys might wonder why. Well, in general, I prefer a much more natural, simple look in the fairer sex: less makeup, less fancy hair and I'm a strong proponent of a healthy body shape. Some of the waifs parading around my old college campus worried me, it was definitely a big problem at two prominent national sororities. Anywho, I hate fake boobs because to even a casual observer, they  never  look real. It's quite simple, real boobs are made of soft fatty tissue that is  lobed  and shaped as women develop through adolescence. They get bigger and smaller as women go through natural phases. Fake boobs are static, firm plastic  circular  bladders filled with saline. Also, often the women in hollywood who get fake breasts are girls who are in really good shape since they don't have the fat for real breasts, so when they get big fake breasts they don't have the skin and other tissue to support the monstrosities they've had tacked onto their chests. Even good fake boob jobs don't last because the skin begins to ripple or the fake boobs sag or drift in weird directions. Most importantly, fake boobs are a lie. I don't walk around on 3-inch platform shoes despite the fact I know some women might find a taller guy more attractive. Be who you are. Sometimes we shouldn't do what science might allow us.

       Is American Crime and Punishment Obsessed or is it just Me?   So tonight, after I finished watching  Law and Order: Criminal Intent  followed by newcomer  Crossing Jordan , I was suddenly struck with my tv-viewing obsession, and frankly, I don't think I'm alone. With all of the hype about reality tv, the crime/punishment drama saturation is getting little attention. The  Law and Order  franchise has 2 successful spinoffs from the original, my favorite being  SVU . I think what I find appealing about  SVU  is the ridiculously vile crimes. Sadistic kid doesn't just kill, he kills and collects the skulls of his animal and human victims. In comes Dr. Huang and he tells us that the serial killer wouldn't throw away the murder weapon because the knife is the embodiment of his penis, a weapon he later uses to kill his high-society mother who has been sexually abusing him continuously since adolescence; it's part freak show, part guilty pleasure. Beyond the three  Law and Orders , there's  The Shield ,  CSI ,  CSI Miami ,  Crime and Punishment ,  the Practice  (recently cancelled but due to have a spinoff),  JAG  and  Navy NCIS  for the military lovers out there, the senior senator  NYPD Blue ,  Cold Case  and even a  CSI: NY  in the works for next fall.  The basic formula for all of these is approximately the same, some mix of detective work and lawyering: a mysterious/sordid crime leaves evidence that requires some forensic science and then the prosecution and defense lawyers duel it out, a few red herrings or plot twists are tossed in for variety. Flavor with type of crime, or focus on lawyers or cops, an interesting and diverse ensemble cast and BINGO you have a show.  We can't get enough of it. As a side effect of all of this, though, I find cop-movies laughable. They don't use warrants, rarely give suspects due process, shoot first all the time, totally unbelievable.  Anywho, my current favorite top 5:  1. Law and Order: SVU  2. JAG (Catherine Bell...and a throwback to a less cynical world of "character" and "honor") 3. Law and Order: Criminal Intent 4. the practice (had staying power despite changes in the ensemble and the final episodes were hysterically funny with "denny crane") 5. Crossing Jordan (set in Boston, good combo of forensics and copwork)

       This is your daily "person of color" blog   So while scanning nationalreview.com, I came across  urlLink this article by Catherine Seipp  about a panel of bloggers held in LA aimed at representing most of the political spectrum and so naturally, criticism came in this form, "Never mind the progressives on that panel; how many bloggers of color did you have?" one of [her] commentators huffed. "Didn't think so."  My response varies somewhere between a sigh and jumping up and down yelling with anger. This is just another example of what goes on in all other media and especially on college campuses. Essentially, it is assumed that people of color have different points of view to offer than do people who aren't "of color." (aka white people and in some camps, asian people) Now, I don't have much of a problem with this position. I don't sunburn as much as my pale friends and maybe I got a few more suspicious looks in stores when I was 14. Wouldn't it be nice if this is where it stopped?   But it never does. When any people of color do not toe the ideological/political line they're  supposed  to toe, the charges of "betraying their people" or they've negated their color or worse (house n*gger) come flying in from haters on the left. Colin Powell, Condy Rice, Clarence Thomas are essentially branded as tools of the right-wing. Their achievement is cheapened because they are suspected of receiving favor from "the man". (of course achievement derived from affirmative action isn't cheapened...oh wait) It's as if they're not black because they're conservative. Black people aren't allowed to be conservative? The idiocy here is only exacerbated when applied to the Latino community which includes both traditionally conservative and liberal blocs. The horrible crime being perpetrated here is based not on the assumption above, but on the assumption that belonging to a racial group  requires  that one have certain political/social beliefs. This is preposterous and repugnant. My skin tone does not require me to believe in anything, moreover it is only a component part of my individual identity (those of you who have read my blog since its inception know that I'm more obviously focused on other things) Race should not be a proxy for thought. Continuing to insist that people must think of themselves as parts or spokesmen of racial groups only serves to undermine the progress we've made in judging the content of character.

       Whence Wah Hoo Wah?   Some of you who read this might be wondering how or why I chose this title for my blog. Ok, some of you aren't at all. But I wanted to be absolutely clear. Some of you out there just know it as some verbotten phrase, the reasons for which are vague but unquestioned. For some well-researched background info check this out  urlLink here . Basically, some well-intentioned students created "wah hoo wah!" as a chant to foster school spirit back in the late 1800s. Administrators in the 1970s decided it was "offensive" and so it is now pretty darn divisive. For those of you unfamiliar with Hanover, in some circles the old College cheer is tantamount to yelling "N*gger!" Something is terribly wrong when made-up nonsense words gain this much value as a result of their detractors' wishes and with no clear logic to back it up. Yes, Dartmouth failed its mission with regard to Indians during its first century. The irony is that detractors of Dartmouth's Indian mascot and other traditions would have objected to what Dartmouth was supposed to teach Indians in the first place: namely to give them a Western education and to Christinize them. Added to this is that several publications (from Sports Illustrated to the Dartmouth Review) have done polling research of Native American populations and most are either apathetic about Indian Mascots or support them. The differences don't even vary when viewed as seperate populations that live on reservations and those who do not. It is a super-vocal minority and their non-native liberal allies who make all the noise on college campuses and in front of  urlLink Fedex Field . What cooks my goose even more is that many of this folks aren't sportsfans. For example, they don't really understand my relationship and feelings to the symbol of two red socks hanging side by side. There isn't a hierchy between me and the socks. They don't serve me and they certainly aren't supposed to represent or affect the self-esteem of socks everywhere. Those socks represent a team I follow as passionately as any nationalist of the 20th century. They mean I hate New York City and its team. They mean I live and die by everygame they play. I  love  my socks in red.  So, fast forward to this century and school spirit towards the teams on the field is often apathetic, football crowds don't fill Memorial Field and a team has to be making a lot of noise with wins to get noticed. Dartmouth has such a proud athletic tradition and its students are essentially fair-weather fans. Big Green? Gimme a break. No one gets behind a color, albeit a bigger one than average.  My blog is named Wah Hoo Wah because those words mean to me a stab at the eye of intellectual sloth, political censorship, and of course love for my dear old Dartmouth; of days when its teams challenged for national championships (think football games against Army and Notre Dame, baseball, basketball and hockey) and there was pride in our institution for more than what it does for your career or academic reputation.   Come stand up men and shout for Dartmouth. Cheer when the team in green appears. For naught avails the strength of Harvard, When they hear our mighty cheer: WAH HOO WAH HOO WAH!  Fight, fight, fight for Dartmouth, And tear on down the field. Touchdown, Touchdown, Dartmouth, For the old Crimson's strength must yield.

       Neglected, Confused, Betrayed?   Dear Blog, I haven't forgotten you. A summary of the past few days:  Saturday Night: Party at Alexis'. Fun was had, stayed in Central Square with Jean. Sunday: I was late to picke up my girlfriend Meghan at Logan in the am, but couldn't contain my elation anyways. I probably looked like Homer when he's licked a frog or two. This was capped as we watched the Sox win in extras after Schillings No-No bid failed, Foulke blew the save, and then McCarty (McCarty!) jacked a homerun over centerfield to end it. Monday: BBQ'd for the g/f and family, watched the Sox lose a makeup game. Finally saw  The Big Lebowski ; should have seen in back in the late '90s. Tuesday: drove a total of 8 hrs to see my uncle at his surprise 60th birthday party.  Meghan leaves tomorrow am. Clearly, this wasn't enough after not seeing her for 3 months. These days have just flown by.

       If the supply of virtue is insufficient in a free society like America, it is almost nonexistent in Islamic societies because coerced virtues are not virtues at all.  —Dinesh D'Souza   Some of you know I've been playing church-leage softball this summer for my church. This has provided me with no end to discussion and reflection. First of all, that it is a church-team seems to be in name only as I'm one of only 3 church-goers on the team. The other 8 or 9 regular players are all softball ringers, obsessed joe-sixpacks who play for a variety of teams all spring and summer long, buy $300 bats and come to play after installing garage doors or spending their day roofing in the heat. Although I was initially put off by the number of non-church goers on a church team, ironically I guess it serves one interest of the church and the league which is out-reach.  On different level, I've found myself frustrated on the one hand by men who are condescending towards me because I don't play as well as they do or hit the ball as long--and yet on the other hand I've also come to enjoy the most redeeming aspect of playing which is the comraderie that has grown between myself and a couple of the guys. Most of the guys enjoy busting my balls and I don't mind the majority of it, but part of me bristles at their condescention because they remind me of the jerks I used to play little league with: the quick on the field but slow in the classroom if you know what I mean. I'm a pretty competitive bastard, but I've never gotten my self-worth from my success in the batter's box. To be honest, I also enjoy playing because part of me wants to redeem the chubby, bespectacled 11-year old kid who couldn't field a baseball to save his life.

       I scoured the world for more Wah Hoo Wah out there   ...and came across  urlLink this blog by "Footer"  who as far I could tell from the text is an Dartmouth Alumn at a law school and apparently a member of Phi Delt. I think he adequately covers a frustration I've had on many an occasion and one I think many of you reading this have probably encountered in your day-to-day lives away from Hanover (or indeed any of you when away from your respective institutions of similar reputation: Yale, Harvard, Stanford, etc).  Essentially, in casual conversation with a new acquaintence, if you come right out mentioning that you went to Dartmouth, it's arrogant or snobby...but probably worse if you try to avoid it while telling a college-era story about you and your best friend Joe trying to drink a gallon of milk, knowing full well you'd be booting and they ask "where did you go?", it's like you've baited them. Yet it would be sweet to be able to be fired up about Dartmouth like someone who goes to Notre Dame Oklahoma, or USC.   Footer puts it best, "I guess the answer would be to invite everyone to a night back at [Dartmouth for a night of  our  pong]. They'd not only see how squalid and disgusting much of the fun was, but the ridiculous extent of the same."

       Bling Bling via the Badda-Bing   I have to say I knew  urlLink this  intuitively all along, but thanks to a pair of economists out there, we now know for sure. $50K!?! Holy Cow!  Of course, this means that the inverse is also true...and even better that means when you're NOT having sex and doing something else implies opportunity cost. Or something like that.

        Duty  Day   Today, while running into the grocery store for a few quick things, I saw a smallish, elderly man with his wife doing their shopping. I noticed he was wearing a WWII veteran's cap and felt immediately and spontaneously compelled to walk right up to him, offer him my hand-shake and say, "excuse me, Sir, thank you for your service." He shook my hand, and thanked me back with a look of surprise. I walked away to get back to my shopping.  Have you thanked a veteran today? How about on Memorial Day? Lately?  I think it is interesting that lately when we talk about John Kerry or Pat Tillman's military service we use worlds like courage and sacrifice, especially since most of us think it is inspiring that men with so much to lose (advantages of a yale education, inherited wealth in the former case and lucrative sports career in the latter) would chose to put their lives on the line in military uniform for causes that were and are controversial; the war in Vietnam and the current war on terror lack unified support from everyday Americans.   But what about duty? I think it is more common to use the word duty when discussing, or when they themselves discuss, the hundreds of thousands of American men who served in World War II. Men from all walks of life (jews, christians, italian, japanese, german, english, irish) dropped what they were doing (teaching, pro-baseball, lawyers, doctors, mechanics) after the attack on Pearl Harbor and enlisted. Yes, they had courage. Yes they all made sacrifices and some of them the last full measure--But I believe they were driven mostly by the  duty  to defend their country and to defend freedom around the world from the evil (yes evil!) enemy of Nazi Germany. Maybe WWII vets benefited from a singularly and morally unquestionable moment. There was no "Why War" campaign or "teach-ins" on college campuses in the spring of '43: too many students had not returned because they had enlisted. It was stop Germany and Japan or accept them as masters.  It's shocking how different it is today. People mock President Bush for using words like "axis of evil" or "evildoers." Maybe you find these characterizations the niave thoughts of a dogmatic simpleton, but why do we have to argue that the deliberate, mass-killings of civilians for shock-value and political ends is evil? Is it any less evil than the dileberate, mass-killings of innocents for expediency and racial purity?  Anywho, thank a veteran or current soldier/sailor/marine for their sacrifice sometime. It's a rewarding experience.

       F***king Chuck Norris   I've had a fun couple of days house-sitting for my friend Kathy's parents and keeping an eye on her 15-year old little brother, Andy. On thursday, we stopped in to catch a little league baseball game. Nobody saw us coming. The parents who go to their son's game, zone out and enjoy idle chit-chat with other adults, just mailing it in. We came for the game fired up and decided to root for the home team, the 9-10 year old Astros. We had a blast cheering these kids on, yelling "quack" when the 'Stros had runners on and standing up and cheering for full counts, with 2 outs.  On friday night, I took Andy to my softball game. I finally had a solid offensive day, going 3-4, with a double and 2 triples...only more anti-climactic as I only managed to move runners over with 1 out in the bottom of the final inning with a deep fly-out to center. We ended up losing by two runs. The Frank Childhood Redemption tour rolls on monday night.  After the game, we went to dinner where we talked sexual politics and I laid on Andy my collected wisdom on alcohol, like Captain Quint from Jaws. (We're gonna need a bigger boat). With kids his age drinking and experimenting younger and younger, I hoped I might answer some of the questions he might have, and help him to avoid making some of the mistakes I made. And as many of you know, I've made my share. At least I avoided telling him about "boot'n'rally" or "thunderdome."  At midnight, We took in Dodgeball with my best friend the Quan and I'll keep my review simple so I won't spoil it for y'all: funny. brief. kept the audience off-balance with fastballs (jokes you see coming) and curveballs (jokes that come out of no-where and catch you lookin'). Worth the price of admission. Well, sort of, you'd think at  $9.50 , it would come with complimentary hookers and cocaine...but I digress. OH SH*T. That reminds me, as we walked in the usher was a dead ringer for RICK JAMES. We took some quiet steps into the theatre and started laughing our asses off. We began to exchange quick one-liners, "What did the five fingers say to the hand? SLAP!" and "cocaine is a helluva drug" when two guys on their way out of the theatre asked us, "Wait--are you guys talking about the guy who looks like Rick James?" You can't make this stuff up.

       Thoughts while mowing the lawn   Mowing my lawn is a totally underrated experience. I can't believe I hated to do it when I was 13. Ok, at 13 I hated pulling the starter cord because I lacked the arm-strength, stepping in my dog's poop and being eaten alive by the mosquitos that find harbor underneath our jungle of trees. Nowadays, mowing the lawn only means I focus on steering the tractor, but otherwise have 50 minutes to let my conciousness stream away. I think about girls I crushed on in high school or remember fun times from the past.  Today I realized that a year had passed since I graduated from college and I didn't really notice or think about that. (realized that I hadn't realized. "the lesson as always: I'm an idiot") June 8th came and went, Dartmouth sent me a "last chance this fiscal year" to give money, but I just zombied along like I have for the past 12 months. As the blade kicked up dust everywhere and I swatted strange bugs away from me, it hit me: Somewhere, sometime I lost respect for myself. I guess when you perceive and value your world through a certain lens, you're at risk of looking yourself in the mirror and thinking you're worthless when you don't fit into your schedule/category of success. That wouldn't be so bad if it didn't rub-off on your family members and friends. Maybe self-deprecating humor is only so funny. Eventually, people might stop thinking its a joke.  There must be some kinda way outa here.

       Reflections    1. For the love of the Game.  I can't wait to coach little league baseball. I'm going to be the best coach ever; I'm going to buy my kids sweet unis, wooden bats (no way I'm going to allow metal bats, they're dangerous and not old-school), and pizza. I will teach them the fundamentals of the game, but above all to have fun. I'm gonna be one big goofy kid coaching them and teach them how to get fired up.   2. 'Queer Eye' Must Die.  I've noticed a cunundrum on the modern man out there: on the one hand, women and others roll their eyes or get sarcastic when a guy does something to affirm his sexuality. It's all about a relaxed confidence they say. On the other hand, a guy who doesn't avoid making positive mention of his heterosexuality might raise eyebrows or create this annoying  urlLink fear . I say keep it old school: feel comfortable talking about playing/watching sports, but try to avoid mentioning those great shoes you're going to buy.  3. The Terrorists Lose  It's a clean sweep: stars, history and offense are  out --defense, hard work, and all around teamwork are  in . The Detroit Pistons join the Florida Marlins and my New England Patriots as victors over evil (sloth and entitlement). The big-picture shift will be (hopefully) a market correction on the top salaries. Why pay a Kobe Bryant/Terrell Owens/A-rod $150+ million when you can pay a bunch of guys 60 million and win a title. It's a shame the NHL is too late.

       Rears [His, Her, Its] Ugly Head   Over the weekend, a friend I hadn't seen in a while asked me if I was going to see  urlLink  Fahrenheit 9/11  ...my answer is filled with apprehension. Once again, Michael Moore reared his ugly head--which as you can tell from the title of this post is one of my favorite expressions. I have a nice mental image of a hulking, dark beast that suddenly shows its even more ominous face, lit by dark sinister eyes and gleaming teeth.   That being said, I have a littany of reservations about seeing this film. First, I'm fairly certain  it isn't a documentary . I am a big fan of the documentary format ever since I started watching basic cable in the early '90s. Lions, whales, insects and my favorite sharks (esp. Shark Week): hidden cameras documenting elements of nature with British scientists narrating the footage as the animals behaved as they might with no camera present. The main problem with Mr Moore is that he goes in the opposite direction. Having seen  Bowling for Columbine  and  Roger and Me , Moore will probably cut and edit his footage making President Bush look criminally stupid and the aftermath of the 9/11 attack and subsequent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq as the evil imperialist machinations of the big oil/neo-conservative cabal---all narrated with Moore's characteristically simple questions that drip with sarcasm and condescention. Now, that might be a valid point of view and Moore's point of view, but Moore won't be presenting his subject matter in this way. He will use the information, footage and quotes that support his point of view, but this makes it a film of persuation. In earlier eras, this sort of film was called a propaganda film. In essence, Moore makes movies as if he was a man doing research and publishing his findings, method, data and thesis in a journal  urlLink like Science , but instead he's just another editorial writer in a major magazine. The most pernicious aspect of this is that the average american who walks into a Michael Moore movie probably doesn't realize the need to make this distinction. (You can read Moore  urlLink defend himself here ).  In case I've gotten my point confused, my bone to pick here is that Moore makes movies that represent opinion, whether you agree with his opinion or not--but he represents his opinions heavy handedly as fact. Other good documentary makers tread the line of impartiality much more carefully or at least present some facts and provide alternate theories. Some of you might want to check out  urlLink Biggie and Tupac  by Nick Broomfield. He does some of Moore's trade-mark ambush-style interviews, but isn't as sarcastic or self-righteous. I think that is what really bothers me most about Moore and his ilk. He's so self-righteous, wrapping himself in the cloak of saintly truth-giver, injustice-fighter and matyr. (isn't it obvious that gunmakers/GeneralMotors/PresidentBush are nothing but evil and wrong?--but "they" don't want to let me tell you!!) So, although I might go to see  Fahrenheit 9/11  because Moore's film might entertain me, expose me to a different point of view and possibly enrage me, I think Moore illustrates a cancer in the left's "activist" camp, namely that if the cause is "right" then the means are justified: be they propaganda films moonlighting as documentaries or the ridiculous lengths gone to in the crusade against big tobacco.   I also want to address some of the controversy that his film has created. When Disney/Miramax did not want to distribute this film, Moore predictably cried foul. He was a victim of the unholy union of Jeb Bush and Disney's interests in Orlando. His allies shrieked, "censorship! first amendment! freedom of speech!" Firstly, censorship is by definition an act of restriction by the government or some other organ with authority. A private entity deciding NOT to publish/distribute something is called tact or better judgement. Disney/Miramax did not stop Moore from producing his film, nor would they (or could they) stop him from distributing it on his own. Hey, I've got some pretty crazy ideas about life, it doesn't mean if I make a movie about it, a company  has  to distribute it. Disney/Miramax has responsiblilities to its shareholders and arguably to society. Some were critical when Miramax released Kill Bill vol. 1 because its was over-the-top with graphic depictions of violence. Disney could have nixed Kill Bill because of these concerns...indeed its not-uncommon for movie studios to have films re-edited to reach an R-rating or PG-rating. Most companies deliberately avoid overtly supporting any party or candidate in an election year. If Disney were to distribute this film, they would have to fear potentially alienating anyone who finds Moore's opinions repugnant (at last count probably somewhere around 49.99% of the US population). Politics today are definitely more contentious and heated than they were a decade ago. Maybe Disney thought it would be irresponsible (both to their shareholders and to society) to mass-distribute a propaganda film chock-full of only one side of the issue. (Now that you've digested some of what I've had to say, watch the trailer  urlLink here )

       Itching like the most minor of sunburns   What I don't think has been addressed enough by anyone in the popular media is the philosophical foundations at the root of the conflict between the Right and Left in the body politic. Like nothing since the Civil War, the Right and Left are horribly divided. Have any of you noticed that each side seems to be talking past each other?   The Right believes tax cuts to the private sector have fueled growth because individuals use capital more efficiently to start or invest in businesses which in turn creats jobs. "Tax cuts for the rich" is pretty much factually correct, if only because the  poor don't pay taxes . The Right believes that there are several macro-economic factors which suggests that the economy is growing. The Right thought in good faith that Iraq had WMD. Dude,  everyone  thought Saddam had WMD. And we have found stuff like Sarin gas and other more mundane stuff, just no nukes or evidence of a big nuke program. That we were wrong about the nuke stuff doesn't make it a lie. The Right thought Saddam was part of the bigger war on terror picture, he offered cash payments to the families of Palestinian suicide bombers. The Right was also going by a general foreign policy principle. If the enemy of my enemy is my friend, then both of my enemies are probably (or could soon be) buddying up. A democratic and peaceful Iraq is possible and it's worth the lost American soldiers today, rather than the potential loss of thousands or millions of Americans in the future.  The Left believes that the tax cuts have done nothing but line the pockets of the wealthy who have the GOP/GBush in their pocket---especially since the unemployment rate has stayed about the same and even as some jobs have been created, more jobs are lost overseas to outsourcing. The Left believes that no American soldiers should be dying in a foreign land for the Oil interests of the energy industry (also in bed with the GOP and the Bush fam). Bush et al knew all along there was no WMD or at the very least maliciously exaggerated the likelihood. There is no direct link between Saddam and Al Qaeda and there never was one.   What's my point? It's obvious both sides are interpretting more or less the same information from vastly different philosophies. The Right is predominately pro-capitalism, small government, nationalistic, and in favor of changing the status quo in the Middle East, unilaterally if need be. The Left distrusts business, wants the US to engage the rest of the world through multilateral organizations and that there is a way to peace through negatiation and that war is the very, very last option. I don't think either side will be able to win over a substantive majority during this national election since it just isn't easy to persuade people away from these core beliefs. The current international, healthcare, economic dilemmas are happening at the very nexus of conflict between these two belief sets. For example, the terrorists won't negotiate, but they're not easily stopped by the hammer of the American military either.  I worry about the future.

       The Current Summary    Torqueedo0: frank Torque0: please save me from my life Torque0: please find a way for us to move to a relatively urban, relatively anglo locale and make millions   And with that, my friends, my buddy JP sums up both our lives in a nutshell. I'm working on a whole host of different outs. But to change it up I offer a story. My friend Ben and I stood in line for an hour to buy day-of tickets at Fenway Park's gate C. Some promo-guy walked up and down the 100-200 person line to give away Schick razors and Sweedish fish. Sometime around minute 48, three Minnesota fans in full jerseys and hats walked by the line and had this exchange about the sometime hostile atmosphere at The Park:  "Hey Bob, we picked a  great  day to come to fenway...they're givin away razors."

       Another Top Ten List!   This one will be debated here and in dark-lit tables or bars for a while. This is my TOP TEN RACIAL/ETHNIC SLURS. Calm down for a second. I, of course, have some sensible criteria for this list. For one, the N-word does not make this list. The N-word just comes with WAY too much baggage, and honestly, I don't like it. The slurs on this list come from eras past and don't have the same level of history of hate and violence. These are some you might hear from some old coot who's clearly still living in the 1930s. These are for the most part anachronistic to the point that many of us have forgotten their origin. Oh and they strike me as funny. Right or wrong pathetic ignorance is funny. These made the list not because they're not hateful--because directed at the proper people they clearly are, but they don't have enough hate-momentum, if you will, to be taken seriously. Yes, there could be some serious dialogue as to why some are funny, some are not, or why you or I find one of these more or less offensive. But that's for a different post. Oh yeah. and  absolutely don't take this seriously. at all.  Laugh or don't laugh. That is all I ask for.   10. Floppy-Head  This is a great image. You gotta hand it to the guys at South Park for inventing a slur for Canadians out of no-where.   9. Goo-Goo  Some of you have no idea what this is. But it's a slur from back during the Spanish-American war when the US fought in the Philipenes.  8. Cracka  An off shoot of "whitebread" this one has come into more usage in the last 10 years or so.  7. Wetback  Although some might find the idea of a Mexican swimming across the Rio Grande characterized this way kind of demeaning, it's a much better turn then the dudes who try to brave the desert further west on the boarder with New Mexico and Arizona.  6. Camel-Jockey  A fun term for our friends the Arabs. My friend Safadi actually has a picture of himself riding on a camel in Syria, but camels aren't nearly as common a mode of transport as we think they are. Oh and they spit.  5. Honky  A shot at the poor rednecks who were just bitter that at least poor black folk had an excuse.  4. Gook  Sounds funny. And now it only implies the North Koreans. And they only have enough money and energy to fuel their dictator's porn collection.  3. Kraut  Now you get on your hot dog or braut, but at one time we didn't like the Gerry's very much at all. Fought them twice, then sent over 5% of our GDP so that they'd be our friends.  2. Gringo  Mi madre dice este casi todos los dias, que me olvido que "gringo" is una palabra irrespetuoso a los Americanos. Ella todavía llama mi papa un gringo cuando el la molesta.  1. WOP  I hadn't really heard this one until I was a junior in high school, but it still gives me the giggles. Firstly, it's derived from "with out papers," the achronym of which was stamped on incoming Italian immigrants at Ellis Island. Pre-Fascist Italy apparently didn't keep good public records and this was a source of ridicule used by other European immigrant groups. You'll remember Hollywood Studio Chief Wallstein from the Godfather, "I don't care how many dago, guinea wop greaseballs come crawling out of the woodwork, Johnny Fontane is not getting in that picture." Tom Hagen says, "I'm not Italian, I'm German-Irish." Wallstein finishes, "Well listen here, my Kraut-Mic friend, Johnny Fontane is never gets that movie!"

       Neo: But if you already know, how can I make a choice?  The Oracle: Because you didn't come here to make the choice, you've already made it. You're here to try to understand  why  you made it. I thought you'd have figured that out by now.    Has there been any more simpler statement of the dilemma that faces the person who believes in the omniscient, omnipotent God and yet who derive their sense of being from free will?   I've always felt that  Matrix: Reloaded  was super underrated. It combines some decent philosophy with the best "chase" sequence ever. I'm not kidding. Watch it again. Nothing can hold a candle to Morpheus, Trinity, and the Key Maker on the crowded highway running away from those albino-rasta twins, "human" police and agents all at the same time. A few great fights and a sprinkle of existential romance with the fate of mankind all in the balance, what's not to like??

       The Good, the Bad, and the Academic   I have a natural suspicion of books that become way too popular too quickly, and sometimes that skepticism pays off. I finally read  The Da Vinci Code , and I have a few responses.  Firstly, it's a fun book to read. The cliff-hangers and twists are great. But part of me had to wonder at the history behind the novel, since the author went to lengths to state that much of his book was fact. I, subsequently, approached some of his claims and the general thesis/conspiracy theory of his book with a fair degree of skepticism. For most of his more outrageous claims, you can find an answer from a real academic  urlLink here .   I feel like ultimately, his conspiracy theory plays on the expectations of a crucial core of his readers (to get the ball rolling)...that is to say, a great portion of the book review/media people out there are well aware of the feminist critique of much of the Western Literary Canon, so here comes along a book that decries the whole of orthodox Christianity as a patriarchal kabal to surpress the divine feminine. Cloaked in a mystery novel,  The Da Vinci Code  in many respects is telling a certain portion of the U.S. exactly what it wants to hear, serious research or fair assessments of facts be damned (See Michael Moore's F9/11 or Bowling for Columbine).  What I think is most pecular about  the Code  phenomenon is that this book falls under the category of  fiction , yet has so many people giving it more consideration it's due.

       Dead Men Walking, Wearing Red Sox   As some of you might already know, Boston got swept in the Bronx by Yankees this week. As I detailed in a blitz to my buddy Poitras, the Sox lost these three in the most painful ways possible.  Game 1: Blow out, frustrated by many errors Game 2: Battled, Held lead and lost on errors Game 3: Close game back and forth into extras, multiple chances at putting it away and even led going into the bottom of the 13th, 2 strikes 2 out and lost. LOST. This team needs viagra AND levitra.  That being said, I'm so terribly close to becoming less like a youthful optimistic, faithful, hopeful red sox fan and more like a jadded, old-guard, bitter, "the season is over july 1st" red sox fan.  On the brighter side of things, I'm back off the wagon.   Where is  my  Mrs. Lafave???

       Scott Peterson Must Die and Take  Me  To Smoothy King   I don't know why  urlLink this  is a national story at all. But have you noticed that the murder case of Laci Peterson (and the trial of accused husband Scott) has had legs for one and a half years already? Aside from the rather gruesome details of the how the remains of Laci and her (un)born fetus were found, there's no real reason the national media is following this so intently. It's like they decided this was hi-profile and even though they're wrong, they won't admit it, so they stubbornly follow it up just not to look like a bunch of vulturous goons. As far as I can tell, it's just a garden-variety murder mystery where the spouse of the deceased is the lead suspect. Fodder for L&A: CI,  maybe .  Now  urlLink this  is a story that could leap right over the Peterson trial and  should  have the focus of the national media right through the dog days of summer. A 23-year old teacher in Florida is charged with 2 counts of lewd and lascivious battery and 1 count of lewd and lascivious exhibition with a 14-year old student. I know what you're thinking, but this is a  female  teacher having sex with a  male  student. Read all the ridiculous details  urlLink here , courtesy of the good people at thesmokinggun.com. Sadly, there won't be much coverage, because the name of the teenager cannot be disclosed because he's a minor and she isn't an NBA basketball star. But c'mon! there are soooo many angles to investigate here:  1. Was a crime really committed here? This teacher is hot as hell and probably made the kid's adolescence. He was bragging only days afterwards and believe me, he won't shut up about it for the rest of his life. He'll be telling this story in bar-rooms and locker-rooms for decades.  2. On the other hand, although I'm quick to question the crime status of hot female teacher having sex with teenage male, aren't we as a society more inclided to believe that a male teacher having sex with a teenage female is more clearly a crime? 3. And is this inclination just another indictment on the deep-rooted differences between men and women and how we perceive them? 4. Did this teacher want to get caught? For knowing that it was forbidden, she didn't really spend a lot of time worried that it be kept a secret.  For me, it's summed up in these few lines from the alleged "victim's" statement:   "He was sitting on the couch when she sat next to him and asked him if he wanted to have sex. He told her he did. While he was sitting on the couch, she straddled him facing him and and asked him if he was sure. He said yes."   Some implications:  1. Her husband must be hurting; not performing well in bed and his wife cheated on him with a 14-year old. 2. Some of you are thinking that this is really sick and how can I not see that the desparity in age means she took advantage of him. Well, I guess part of me remembers being 14 and I sure as hell would have said yes. Don't kid yourselves, this is nearly every 14-year old boy's DREAM. Also, if he can't give consent at 14, does that mean all of the fooling around we did as 8-graders or freshmen in high school was illegal? Or is it merely the fact that one of the parties is above the "age of consent" and the other is not that makes this a crime? How arbitrary is this line? Obviously legally he couldn't consent, because we wrote the law believing that he couldn't appreciate the severity of the question...but read that quote again, man. Dude knew what was up.  Comments appreciated from all viewpoints.

       More on Moore   Now that his documentary has been given its opening weekend in full distribution, I decided to see what comments have surfaced about Fahrenheit 9/11. Some highlights from the IMDB.com that only further my point that Moore's film is not a documentary, but rather propaganda (I'll include a note whether it was from a positive or negative review):   "I'm not a huge Michael Moore fan. He's often too extreme and close-minded, but that doesn't mean I wasn't up and cheering (philosophically speaking) during his controversial Oscar acceptance speech at the 2003 Oscars. I see his point more times than not, and often agree with him. If he makes up facts, so what?"  (Positive)   "If you are looking for a fair and measured evaluation of all of the facts you can skip this movie. This movie is an opinion piece and thus one sided. Criticizing it for being one-sided only proves that you miss the point."  (Positive)   "Moore's apparent thesis--that Bush and his cronies are bent on world domination--is laughably absurd. Fahrenheit 9/11 is essentially a long string of insane conspiracy theories babbled by a lunatic you'd normally expect to see somewhere in a Manhattan subway clinging to a sign with a warning about an impending apocalyptic nightmare. The only people who can truly appreciate a movie like this are those who are most susceptible [to] believe lies, distortions, and inaccuracies--that is, the gullible."  (Negative)   "Fahrenheit 9/11 may be one of the only films I've ever seen where the audience - most of them - began prolonged cheering when the director's name appeared in the OPENING sign boards. That reflected, of course, the political leaning of an affluent Westchester audience that was all-white and which filled surrounding parking lots with SUVs and luxury cars (my Honda Civic a small disgrace)."  (Interesting footnote from a positive review)  I guess I'll have to go see it sometime soon, but I might have to sneak in. I don't like the idea of paying for propaganda. From the Administration or from Moore, I think it should be free. (I know that last comment doesn't really further my thesis that Moore made a propaganda film, but it actually ties into a thesis I have regarding the linkage between fuel demande and terrorism...but that's for another post.)

       Strugglin' with the Skin   I've been crapplin with a strange issue lately. I substituted at my old high school at the onset of spring and I couldn't help but notice a huge change since I graduated 5 years ago. The young women are increasingly scantily clad. Thongs said "hello" and many a navel-piercing was the mid-point between a bust and very low-rise jean. I have no idea how their male counterparts manage to study or focus on a lecturing teacher.   Naturally, the 14-17 year olds are way out in front on this change in American fashion and the rest of us have to deal with the reprocutions. Over the past 5 years I think it's fair to say, young women have been steadily wearing less and less clothing. In started in 1999/2000 with the arrival of the f*ck-mepants. Tight and black. Then came ever-increasing numbers of hip-hugging jeans and f*ckmepants in more colors (tan, white, lightblue, pink) and some with contours (north-south ribbing). With the tighter pants also came more demand for thongs under the guise of the "seamless look." Lastly, we got low and lower-rise jeans and pants.  Up here in the more conservative Northeast (by "conservative," I don't mean politics at all, I'm referring to an oddly Puritan-influence on things like dress, last-call, business on sundays and such), I feel there's a temptation to see one of these skin-baring young ladies and smugly think to oneself "slut." I've heard older men or women quip, "they don't respect themselves." Even my 20-something female peers are not beyond this temptation as I've overheard many a upperclass Dartmouth woman complain about the "young freshmen skanks who don't wear any clothes" annoying galavanting about fraternity basements.   Yet I can't help but feel that this is all unfair or at the very least terribly wrong-headed. First of all, as many would point out, a woman's dress says very little about her proclivity towards promiscious behavior. That is, just because she's wearing pants low and tight enough for a man to stop-short and double-take, doesn't mean she'll necessarily let him take those pants off.  Moreover, why do we here in the US (but moreso the Northeast) rail against this pro-skin trend in the first place? Might it be something about the cultural heritage up here in New England and New York? This sort of thing is pretty standard in places like Miami or Southern California.   The female form is certainly something to appreciate for its beauty, but why does seeing more of it upset create such intrigue? Maybe we can just get used to it or at the very least, enjoy the view.  Oh, and a shoutout to my boy Safadi.

       Off the Team, better luck next year oh and let girls play   Softball should be abolished. How do parents still allow this? The attitude that created softball is essentially, "women can't throw a ball hard over-hand, can't hit a baseball, can't run 90 ft, can't hit a ball farther than 200ft." I'm not arguing that America's daughters should be playing baseball in co-ed leagues (but what that be all that bad up until about 10yrs old?), but I am saying they could be playing baseball against each other. I think we owe girls that opportunity. Baseball is good, clean, All-American fun. Softball is condescending...except for maybe old, unathletic men, like me and my softball teammates.  Ok, one big problem I have with some "sports" out there is that they aren't decided on a quantified basis, but a qualified basis. I don't want to restrict how we define sport too much, but I think a clear and objective method for deciding the victor of a contest should be a necessary condition. I love art, but when your contest is decided at least partially on your artistic expression rather than how many tallys are recorded, then we have a sufficient condition for  expulsion . For example, football is decided by which team can score the most number of points in the allowed time. Football = sport. Let me be clear, a team scores in only one of two ways. A football crosses the plane of the endzone, or it splits the uprights. No bonus points for style, as much as the NFL dudes would like to think so. (Sidenote: bring back the throat slash!) Pairs figure skating, on the other hand, is decided by the composite of two scores: technical merit for how hard and successful your routine was and artistic merit. Pairs figure skating = not a sport. Simple.  Ergo  On The Docket for Immediate Banishment:   1. Figure Skating.  "Ooooh. Stuck the landing, but the French judges tend to dislike the more fancy costumes and the Brahms. That's gonna hurt their score, Jane."  2. Diving.  Spin about, no splash. YAY!  3. Synchronized swimming.  Wasn't this formerly a feature of over-the-top 1950s musicals?  4. Gymnastics.  How do we endorse little girls working their bodies into the ground with zero body fat and judging them for how well they were able to not shift their feet after the pain of the impact from their tumbling? Is NOW so busy attacking the fashion mags that they don't see damage this is doing? To be fair, these events provide with hilarious unintentional commentary, "Wow, look at how she cleanly mounts the apparatus."  5. Cheerleading  I like tradition as much if not more than the next guy, but cheerleaders no longer even do that much at football games anymore. I've been to countless college games and only rarely do the cheerleaders actually  lead  cheers anymore. Sure, they occasionally clap their hands and shout out the teams name after it's been spelled, but that's about it. Mostly they do stunts during timeouts or jump up and down when a team scores. What about all of that intense competitive cheerleading, you ask? Again, it's judged by a mixture of technical merit, and artistic expression.   Please notice I've stayed away from arguing about the level of physical exersion and whatnot. That is not my aim here. I'm also not saying that sport and art should be completely seperate. A diving catch by a centerfielder moving quickly to his left is pretty beautiful, as is the expression of joy on the faces of a team after they'e won the superbowl...but if your event involves the words like "routine" or "judges,"  chances are it isn't a sport. Why you ask? Because then we're talking about pieces of flair. And you  do  want to express yourself, don't you?  The Nazis had pieces of flair.

       Bibere Veritas   For some time now, I haven't liked wine. The long story involves a bitchy-blonde grad student, a bottle of white, and a party at Phi Delt--though not under the hospitality of the brotherhood, but rather the tenants they allowed while they awaited the end of their purgatory, their temporary de-recognition.  That's a story for another time. Tonight, I watched  Big Fish  with my parents. My Mom is always a trip to watch a movie with, since the cultural conventions of viewing film differ drastically from Colombia to the U.S. Let's just say my Mom doesn't observe the "no talking" rule. My Dad is usually stoic, which brings me to my point. Big Fish, brought the three of us to tears. My mom first and obvious, sniffles and covering her face, but what was more surprising was my Dad. I looked over at him and the tears had left behind their paths on his cheeks. This isn't unprecented, but for y'all to understand, if my Mom is the wellspring of emotion, my Dad has been for two decades more often than not the direct opposite. I'll even admit that towards the very end of the film, even I felt a bit misty-eyed.  I know that movies like  Return of the King  and  Cold Mountain  usually receive more critical and box-office acclaim, but maybe we should wonder how it is that a movie like  Big Fish  manages to sneak under the radar somewhat more or less, yet it clearly appeals to a much broader spectrum of humanity with a more profound message. Is this the nature of "classics" which capture the human condition?

       Positively Laughable   While watching  urlLink Nip/Tuck  tonight, I caught an interesting ad. It opened on a street at night with three dudes approaching a car, the driver is about to unlock the vehicle when he stops short with keys in hand. He along with his crew notice this strange violent red feather dancing in the night air. They follow it to a bus, the doors open and they walk into a sophisticated island-themed fiesta.   All very mysterious and intriguing but it was an ad for Captain Morgan's Parrot Bay. First off, it seemed like a "don't drink and drive" spot, then head-and-shoulder faked with the Forrest Gump routine.  Coconut Rum ad aimed at men? They must be joking.  Any man worth his salt does not drink coconut rum.  And that's for a whole host of reasons. Authoritative list of booze to come.

       Absolutely Fascinating AND Funny   A happy belated Independence Day to all who read my blog. While bored and following a series of links from blog to blog, I came across  urlLink  True Porn Clerk Stories  .  From what I gather an educated woman in her late 20s/early30s worked at a video store in Chicago for a while and posted about her observations about porn in general and dealing with the people who rent porn. Her writting is pretty funny, fair and intelligent--with some surprising insights:   And as badly distorted as the female porn body can get, that's nothing compared to what happens to the men.  Here's what the straight boxes have taught me, though: guys are the ones who care about giant cocks. Not women, guys. Especially the straight ones.  But the more I've worked at the video store, the less I'm convinced that porn is inherently degrading, and the line between degrading and not gets blurrier.

        cocaine is a helluva drug    Simple computer games. Why are they so addictive? Why do they appeal so strongly to my sense of competition.&nbsp;I'll never forget my "gateway" game....snood. Freshman fall the Blue Dragon found me.&nbsp;Countless hours of my life were lost to Snood. I'd get back to the dorm after class and I'd Snood for a good hour or two. If I came home early on the weekends, I'd snood it up drunk for a bit before passing out. My two roommates and I waged a war of one-up-manship late into spring term. Snood got us all, though. You couldn't escape the draw of those damn dumb faces, smiling so innocently--and the sounds! The blup-blup of shooting them upscreen, the celebratory cord you'd hear when you cleared up a bunch of the bastards. I studied the angles. I thought of it in terms of simple physics and vectors I never really learned about. I played until my top score was beating that of my&nbsp; son of a bitch&nbsp;roommate "Chip." Yeah, I still despise him. No, I won't be letting it go. I will have my&nbsp;vengence on his smug, arrogant ass&nbsp;and snood isn't even a snowflake of the iceberg that he earned that's&nbsp;drifting slowly his way...   uhhh back to the games   After snood played itself out, I managed to stay clean and sober&nbsp;until Poitras offered me a hit of&nbsp;Miniputt&nbsp;my junior winter. Poitras, Singer and I would blitz back and forth with low rounds....25, 24, 22.....until sometime junior spring I played a 18-hole round of&nbsp;18.  The Perfect Game.  Nothing but holes-in-one. I had it down to a science, aiming the little dots at just the right spot, angle and force to get the right number of bounces before it would rattle into that cup. It has&nbsp;rearred it's ugly head again just after an also-ran about a helicopter&nbsp;tried to creep its way into this addict's day. (Miniputt is now it's listed on an MIT site, different from its original Harvard abode.&nbsp; Play it  urlLink here . The Geeks on the other side of the Charles spend too much time trying to out-do each other. And God bless'em.)  The helicopter game&nbsp;failed to cut mustard as a truly addictive computer game in the Snood/Miniputt mold because your ablility to build up a score is really just determined by the speed of your computer. My newish laptop had me scoring just over 1000pts (about 1000 pts below the competition)&nbsp;until&nbsp;my laptop&nbsp;was running really slowly one day and I scored over 3000 just like that. C'mon. (play that one  urlLink here .)&nbsp;Another, the dropping penguin swung at by polar bear for distance had a chance, but it wasn't readily apparent how to improve your distance. Top of the strike zone or bottom? All to random for me.  I guess it's a subtle balancing act of simple gameplay, accessible venues of competition and simple (flash, mouse)&nbsp;interface that make for a truly addicting computer game. Games like Madden, GTA, etc usually don't play well on PC because they can't compete with the interface of setups like PS2 and Xbox. But if only involves the point and click of a mouse, simple graphics,&nbsp;and a way for me to&nbsp;compete against&nbsp;my friends, I'm all over it.  &nbsp;

        I'm Back!     &nbsp;  Dating my girlfriend long-distance has been an interesting challenge.&nbsp;Certainly weeks of dating someone by phone or email&nbsp;is less than ideal, but spending a solid amount of time with my girlfriend here or&nbsp;at her home&nbsp;Arizona&nbsp;can be a wonderfully sustaining and satisfying experience.     &nbsp;  The first few days are a complete bacchanal:&nbsp;a festival&nbsp;of affection, glutonous meals, lots of celebratory drinking, and a saking of other thirsts (wink, wink). We usually mix in a few fun outings to this tourist attraction or that museum, but I think the most satisfying time is the time we spend doing the alternatively mundane: renting a movie, watching bad cable tv&nbsp;or the Red Sox. Check that--the Red Sox are no where near mundane.    &nbsp;  So after being seperated by thousands of miles and hundreds of days, it was rewarding and heartening to enjoy this time with my girlfriend. Unfortunately, that time came at the expense of you, my darling blog. But not to worry. I have many posts stored away in my head to rant about.    &nbsp;  For&nbsp;starters, I continue to follow-up on Michael Moore.  urlLink Here's a cutting point-by-point disection of some of&nbsp;Moore's arguments . Essentially,&nbsp;Moore makes claims that "sound right" but fail under closer scrutiny.

        3rd World Nation-State Roulette!    As some of you know, yours truly recently discovered he passed the Foreign Service Written Exam. This news came as great relief, lately I had been kind on edge about where I was going with my life. My next step towards a fabulous Foreign Service Officer career is the Oral Assessment to be scheduled this september-ish. Although the idea of living abroad for two years at a time sounds absolutely glamorous and enriching, there's a catch. Of course there's a catch, it's the Federal Government. Good news, bad news. Bad news, the first tour generally has to be done at what's referred to as a "hard-ship" post during mostly consular work (read: stressfully long lines of disgruntled would-be immigrants and mundane forms, stamp visas, etc). These are the sorts of countries where the infrastructure is less than U.S./Euro/Australia standards, ie shaky economy, poor healthcare/education, angry mobs of people who hate the US and like to throw rocks, albiet throw them poorly. Good news: these hardship posts are assessed "hardship differentials." Basically, the government has guidlines that it uses to assign levels of hardship endured by their civilian employees working abroad and they're given a percentage of salary on top of the base. For example if you're assigned to Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia you get paid an extra 5% of base-salary. If you're assigned to Hanoi, Vietnam you get a 25% bonus. (on a base salary of 30K that's an extra 7.5K not to mention the housing allowance)  So, given my language predilections (Spanish, French, English or Portugese) and my aversion to cold-weather climates after paying my dues in Hanover, I've assembled my scouting chart of places I'd like to go, with their differentials listed:  Barbados: Bridgetown -5 Belize: Belize City - 10 Brazil: Sao Paulo - 5 Colombia: Barranquilla - 10, Bogota 5 Cuba: Havana - 20 Ecuador: Guayaquil & Quito - 15 Fiji: Suva - 10 India: Mumbai (Bombay) - 20 Mexico City -15 Pakistan:  Islamabad 20, Karachi 25 Solomon Islands -15 Sri Lanka: Colombo -20 Trinidad and Tobago: Port of Spain -5  The polls are now open, vote now for where I should go. Think of it, y'all,  Wah Hoo Wah goes GLOBAL . I think my early favorite is Sao Paulo, Brazil. I'd love to go back.

        Biggie, Give Me One More Chance    Last night while house sitting, I broke into my employer's bottle of Jameson's Irish Whisky. The inspiration came while I was watching  Lost In Translation  for the first time, which I thoroughly enjoyed---yes, I know what you're thinking: Does he really need any sort of incentive to drink whisky in the first place? But seriously, how could I resist? Bill Murray continuously hawking that&nbsp;"Suntory whiskey for good times....Sontory times."  In other news the rabble of the unwashed, the DNC, is in town as you all know. I rode into the city on tuesday night to have dinner with Alexis, the same of [Mis]adventures fame. The T-ride was weirder than usual. After 45 minutes, I was almost flipping out thinking about how these legions of people actually believe government&nbsp;can be&nbsp;a vehicle for social good. Universal Healthcare, more money spent on education, blah blah blah. I can't help thinking they want to make us into a more European state, yet how can it be helped when they criticize the current Administration on all issues with Europe as an ideal: "our foreign policy needs to be more in line with our European allies, we need healthcare like the Europeans, need to tax fuel like the Europeans."  All of this leads me two believe two things. Firstly, the Dems are no longer Americans. They don't believe in America or think of America as the ideal. Secondly, they're absolute  MORONS . The U.S. is tops in economy, defense and ranks very&nbsp;highly in education, standard of living, and opportunity (especially when considered that countries that beat us in education or opportunties for women are dramatically smaller and easier to&nbsp;manage).&nbsp;Basically, in almost any conceivable category for comparison the United States is the best. We're Numero Uno. And yet the Dems want us to shift our policies to be more in line with the third best team out there: the EU. What a joke. It would be like the Patriots having won another superbowl deciding: you know what? Defense and inventive offense are good, but maybe the Chiefs have it right. More offensive genius and speed is what we need! (Or worse for me to have to state, the Yankees saying to themselves:&nbsp;Boston and Los Angeles&nbsp;has a point. Let's cut our payroll by 70&nbsp;million and compete that&nbsp;way cuz it's better because they say so.  You don't get to be number one by copying&nbsp;number 3's homework, people.&nbsp;

      A Quickie on Global Opinion  Before I get to watch the New Look Red Sox for the first time since saturday's trade, I wanted to post quickly on something Mike brought up in the comments section after my post on  urlLink  Lost in Translation /theDNC/basic Democratic Party policy .  As a rebuke of my position that the Dem position that we should be more like Europe is completely crap, Mike brings up opinion polls around that currently show most people elsewhere in the world have unfavorable opinions of President Bush and the U.S. He then concludes "We no longer have the luxury of being governed by the school of isolationism."  Firstly, I don't think Mike is really referring to the school of isolationism. In IR, that school argues that the United States policy should be derived from a principle of "mind your own business." It's philosophical underpining is drawn from George Washington's farewell address that advised the US from becoming involved in the entangling politics and alliances of Europe. Applied today this would mean not becoming involved in anything abroad that doesn't directly affect us at home. The US would withdraw from NATO (with no USSR, it has lost its raison d'etre), withdraw from our mutual defense pacts with Japan/Taiwan/SouthKorea, etc etc. In the context of the challenge of global terrorism, this strikes me as insane BUT there are those out there, serious academics and polititians, that feel this is what we should do, and generally they're in the Libertarian camp. They argue that if we didn't have so many troops in the middle east or support Israel, Radical Muslims wouldn't hate us--and having close to no troops committed abroad would save boatloads of money that we could spend on education and healthcare.  Of course, I think Mike mispoke, I think he's referring to Unilateralism, which is what our European critics abroad and the Democratic critics of the Bush Administration at home have been accusing us of since we decided to go to war with Iraq without the formal approval of the UN. Unilateralism as it's latin roots clearly implies means the U.S. does what is in our best interest often without consulting or co-operating with other nation states; we go it alone if we want to/have to. Unilateralism lately falls under the banner of the School of Primacy. Primacy is the foreign policy framework where the US does everything it can to maintain it's position as the global system leader--biggest economy, military, most influence in NGO's.  Citing global popular opinion, I believe Mike and certainly Europeans and the rest of the planet want us to follow the tenents of  Multilateralism . This would mean that we wouldn't have gone to war with Iraq because the UN didn't give us approval and several countries out there wouldn't join GW's "Coalition of the Willing."  Multilateralism sounds peachy, it really does. A bunch of countries get together to do something they all agree is the right thing to do and will benefit everyone. Unfortunately, the current global system doesn't relate well and global popular opinion forgets this. First, the collected nations of this planet do not share the risks of international terrorism equally. It's pretty obvious that the US and Israel face the brunt of the hate of Radical Islamists. Second, the costs of stopping the terrorist threat cannot be shared equally. Put simply, the US spends the most absolute money on defense of any country on earth and it  outspends the next 10 countries on the list combined . So, as much as everyone here in the US would want other countries to supply more troops and supplies to our effort in Iraq, other countries just don't have it in the cupboard. The last obstacle to true multilateralism is that global concensus is almost impossible to reach. Terrorism isn't the easy call of Nazi Germany where it was relatively clear that Hitler was not going to stop until he took over the world. The US and Western Europe just don't have the same interests when it comes to terrorism.  Defending the United States and being it's President is not a global popularity contest and it shouldn't be. The President, regardless of who he is, is responsible and accountable only to American voters. And this is the disjuncture of the Democratic Party. They argue that having Europe on board would make the war against terror easier, but the bottomline is that most of them don't have significant resources to offer to the cause. Ultimately, I don't want a popular President or government, I want an effective one.  If you're questioning President Bush's effectiveness, please consult Mr. Kadafi.

        Nomar No Mas    So, today I'm writing from Tucson. This is WAH HOO WAH live from Arizona. Apparently, while I was in the air over the midwest, the Red Sox traded away Nomar Garciaparra to the Cubs and involving 3 other teams, got back a SS, 1B and an OF.  I heard about the trade while my plane was taxing about the runway and I checked my voicemail. Over the din of the airplane cabin noise, I could only hear my buddy Joe say "we got NOMAH" and that we got a bunch of players names I couldn't make out.  From what I can tell, this trade improves our defense at 1B and gets us a speedier outfielder. The improvement isn't that profound, that much is obvious. As far as I can tell this trade was about clearing the clubhouse air. After the aborted trade in the offseason and his injury, Nomar didn't look happy in the dugout. He was playing like a pro, but you could tell he wasn't the same guy. No smiles, not up on the rail with his teammates during that game against hte yankees.  I feel really weird about this in its aftermath. I feel like after a very fun, successful relationship with a girlfriend, we got to the point where it was best we part ways. There had been a spat of bad blood and now it wasn't the same. No hard feelings, it's not like I hate her or anything, but it's clear it's over and if you don't break up with her now, you know she's gonna break up with you soon anyways. Now you'll have to see her every now and then, say hi, politely catch up. You still feel like you hope good things happen to her. In a way it's the closest thing to an amicable breakup, if there is such a thing. Sure there was some drama and some hurt feelings, but you don't harbor ill-will and you're happy about the prospects of a fresh start.  For those of you wondering, when I landed in Phoenix it was about 108 degrees and completely dry. In fact, when I left massachusetts it must have been 83 with 60% humidity....and they didn't feel that dissimilar.  Also, my first meal before the drive down to tucson was the ever famous  IN AND OUT  burger. It was awesome, friends. Absolutely awesome. I savored every bite of the best rapidly prepared burger in America. It's totally equal to the hype produced by southern californians during my freshman year of college.

        Sad, Sad Pigeon Holes and Some Biased Analysis    This afternoon, I got home to check blitz and found myself on the recipient list of this forwarded email from my friend Cara:    Things you have to believe to be a Republican today.      1. Saddam was a good guy when Reagan armed him, a bad guy when Bush's daddy made war on him, a good guy when Cheney did business with him,and a bad guy when Bush needed a "we can't find Bin Laden" diversion.     2. Trade with Cuba is wrong because the country is communist, but trade with China and Vietnam is vital to a spirit of international harmony.     3. The United States should get out of the United Nations; our highest national priority is enforcing U.N. resolutions against Iraq. 4. A woman can't be trusted with decisions about her own body, but multi-national corporations can make decisions affecting all mankind without regulation.     5. Jesus loves you and shares your hatred of homosexuals and Hillary Clinton. 6. The best way to improve military morale is to praise the troops in speeches while slashing veterans' benefits and combat pay. 7. If condoms are kept out of schools, adolescents won't have sex.      8. A good way to fight terrorism is to belittle our long-time allies ("that's old Europe") and then expect their cooperation and money. 9. Providing health care to all Iraqis is sound policy.     Providing health care to all Americans is socialism.     10. A President lying about an extramarital affair is an impeachable offense. A President lying to enlist support for a war in which thousands die is solid defense policy.     11. Government should limit itself to the powers named in the Constitution, which include banning gay marriages and censoring the Internet.     12. Being a drug addict is a moral failing and a crime unless you're a conservative radio host. Then it's an illness and you need our prayers for your recovery. FEEL FREE to pass this on. Friends don't let friends vote Republican.        Someone on the list replied to recipients and offered their response to some of these points, but I wanted to put mine up here to kill two birds with one stone (blog for the night and respond). My responses ended up being kind of involved, so if you choose not to read all the way down, remember this: To vote or be a Republican you don't have to believe in any of these things. Most of these things are the stereotype of some crazy far-right Christian fundamentalist, neo-con war-hawk. In fact, this list reminds me about the growing trend in society where people who have a single, strong belief or cause for change such as pro-choice or gay-rights activist tend to be Democrats. Yet, if I was going to say there was one most important thing a Republican should believe in, I would say "smaller government, strong defense." Anyone who thinks that the federal government should be smaller and generally stay out of everyone's way should vote Republican. If we differ about gay marriage or environmental stuff, I don't care as long as we agree on that phrase. Taxes bad. Markets good.  1. I'm tempted to forgive this skewed and mistaken analysis of history since it's common to neophytes of foreign policy. As a general rule, foreign policy is often a choice between the lesser of two evils, tempered by "the enemy of my enemy is my friend." Since one of the bigger responsibilities (if not  the  biggest) of a sitting government is the sovereignty and security of the state, this often means strange and changing alliances. It doesn't matter if the President is a Democrat or a Republican, this is always the calculation of a head of state. So, although this redux on Saddam is technically accurate--it naively ignores the larger picture. It wouldn't be any different to say in 1941 we were friends with "Uncle Joe" Stalin and then in 1945 he was the main threat to the U.S. So what changed? It's obvious that in '41 we needed the USSR to fight off the greater evil of Hitler and Japan and then with that threat ended, the Communists were the biggest threat. Bottomline, Saddam was a lesser evil than Iran or the Soviets, but once the Cold War ended and the era of global terrorism began, Saddam became persona non grata. Claiming that Saddam was a distraction is just silly. Bringing home Bin Laden's head on a plate would be the biggest political prize the Bush administration could claim. Mark my words, Bin Laden dead or alive before November 2 and this election is over.  2. I don't know why we still have this embargo with Cuba, but it has nothing to do with free trade with Vietnam and China. Trade with China and Vietnam has to do with global capitalism, no Republican worth his salt would put "global harmony" above Econ 1's relative advantage. The embargo on Cuba has everything to do with the ethnically Cuban electorate in Florida and if the Democrats want to win Florida's votes for real this time they will continue to support the embargo, too.  3. Sigh. Who said we needed to get out of the UN? If anything, this is a libertarian position, since the UN involves the US in too many things not directly (read super-directly) in the interest of the US. Republicans never used the phrase "highest moral priority" when describing the need to enforce the Resolution against Iraq. The Bush administration did say that without teeth, UN resolutions were meaningless. For the entire Cold War, the UN was meaningless because of US/Soviet vetos. It's meaningless now for the same reason with a different cause: the different interests of the Security Council. Don't kid yourselves, France and Germany said "give peace a chance" but what they meant was "we own too much Iraqi (Saddam's) debt." Either way, this Republican thinks the UN as presently constituted (Security Council of permanent members runs the show) is digging itself a grave next to the League of Nations for largely the same reasons.  4. Many Republicans are not "pro-life" just as there are a few Dems who aren't "pro-choice." I don't even know how this made its way into the agenda, Roe v. Wade is not under any sort of attack at the fundamental level. Moreover, the core of the decision on a legal level is about personal autonomy. Hey, personally I think if you choose to get an abortion, you're going to hell. But no more so than someone who lives their life based on the pursuit of greed and sex. Both of these things the government shouldn't involve itself in--many Republicans structure their beliefs this way. As to corporate misdeeds, regulations as Democrats usually construe them  are never the answer . I can't go into too much detail, but government would be better off crafting market forces to create desired social results: ie, give tax breaks to companies and car owners who build/buy more fuel efficient autos or conversely tax poor fuel efficiency. Given these market constraints, the result would be better than government saying "you can't have this."  5. Hillary sucks. I don't know how she has the support of feminists or Dems at all. She rode the coattails of her husband to a seat in the Senate of a state she didn't live in until the election year and she put up with decades of adultery. How is this not the grossest case of nepotism? How can you point the finger at GDub for being Daddy's son and not at Hillary? God doesn't hate anyone, but the Judeo-Christian/Muslim God certainly doesn't condone homosexual behavior--but again, I as a Republican don't think the federal government should involve itself in these matters.  6. I don't know much about veteran's benefits and how they were changed, but I do know that much of them were probably created after WWII. The size and nature of our military has changed a great deal since, most notably WWII-Vietnam involved drafts, while the current military is entirely professional. "Cutting benefits" might not sound nice, but it could be the right thing to do. Cutting spending in general is a Republican trait and I totally support it. I don't believe the federal government is a good vehicle for social good, so shrinking it is generally good.  7. There's a fine line between educating adolescents about sex and facilitating their sex. Ignoring adolescent sexuality isn't the answer, but neither is "here kid, use this and you'll be fine."  8.  urlLink Alliances are good things to have, but we shouldn't give up on foreign policy goals just to retain them --after all, what good are they if they don't help with our problem now? As to "belittling" them, the British don't feel that way. The French and Germans, Belgians, et al feel belittled but (and this goes for France especially), they're just ignoring geopolitical reality. The United States is the global economic and military hegemon. We expect some quid pro quo from NATO/EU because we were in their corner during WWII/ColdWar, but maybe that's wrongheaded. Much of the EU doesn't face the threat of terrorism like we do, so naturally they're not jumping at the idea of sharing the cost. Monetarily, we're talking about nickles and dimes, though, when this war on terror is costing some benjamins. Remember that the US outspends the top 2-10 countries combined in absolute money on defense. As far as hard military assests there is little that other countries beyond Britain and Japan can offer the US, but many are offering logistical support on hunting down terrorists, differences on the War in Iraq aside.  9. Providing health care to Iraqis is important because much of their infrastructure was destroyed by Gulf War I/II and bad upkeep by Saddam, without some of their health needs being met it's difficult to imagine Iraq forming a healthy democracy and  a democratic Iraq is in our best interest.  As for healthcare for every American, the choice is between the best healthcare money can buy for 95% or mediocre/poor health care for 100%. I choose the former since the latter would involve the biggest bureaucratic, wastful monstrosity the world might ever see. Universal State-led Healthcare is socialism. Socialism is bad. It only works well in places like Sweden or Denmark because their populations are so small and used to donating more than half of their income to the public wellfare.    10. This first line is disengenuous. A President lying about an affair to a grand jury is an impeachable offense. It's called purjury; you or I would face a fine or worse if we did the same. Moreover, he had sex with an intern--a more horrid example of abuse of power to sexual ends I can't think of. Any CEO would have been GONE. How NOW didn't crucify him is beyond me...except that is was the GOP that lead the witch hunt, so that made it ok? In Jan '03, the CIA, the French, the Israelis, GDub, Kerry... everyone  thought Saddam had WMD. To accuse GDub of lying would be to accuse most governments on earth of the same. A global kabal lied about WMD? Enough all ready! For Bush to have lied about the existence of WMD in Iraq he would have had to have known conclusively  before  troops hit the ground that there wasn't any, despite everyone and their mom feeling pretty sure that Saddam did have WMD hidden somewhere. Believing that Bush knew when everyone else didn't is just a detail to forget when you want to hate him.  11. Yeah, Republicans generally prefer "strict constructionist" interpretations of the Constitution. And the proposed amendment defining marriage as a union of a man and a woman is a response to some judges reading our constitutions quite liberally. But proposing an amendment to the Constitution is fair game, the Dems have proposed a few themselves. I don't support censoring the internet. But if we're going to through around the "censhorship" mud, let's take a look at the college campuses around the country that censor lots of speech that "offends" people.  12. I don't really listen to Rush. I prefer  urlLink Laura Ingraham , a fellow alumnus of the Old College. I don't even know what the charge against Republicans is here....did he not get prosecuted? I'd prosecute his ass. Is the complaint that we should legalize drugs? Being against legalization is definitely not a Republican-only position.

        Awkward    I got back from my annual visit to the eye doctors this afternoon after something odd went down. During my exam, we got to talking about my color blindness and how I feel like it doesn't manifests itself in any ways I can point to aside from a few shirts I own that I thought were one shade of one color, but turn out to be a shade of a different color. I said that I guess I tend to enjoy and prefer wearing clothing the color of which I can easily distinguish or clothing with sharp contrasts or bright colors which lead my eye doctor to say  "that's the negro in you."  To say I was confused, puzzled and feeling awkward is an understandment. I just held a pause and said..."uhh what do you mean." He nervously, quickly went on to explain how black folks wear bright colors...I was more confused. "I'm sorry, do you think I'm black?," I asked him. He mumbled some quick apologies and started to retreat about making a bad joke, conceeding that it wasn't exactly PC.  To me, the problem here isn't that he made a joke that involved a race/ethnicity. It just wasn't funny. I suppose it might have been funny back in the late 80s, early 90s when pop/hip-hop artists started wearing "African" color schemes and African-Continent pendants. I felt even more odd because after his joke bombed, he was afraid I was somehow offended. I actually don't care about insensitive jokes and stereotypes. They can be darn funny and I think people shouldn't censor themselves and especially humor. Funny is funny. What offended me was that his joke just wasn't funny.

        Missing the Dry Air, Sunshine and Arizona Love    I'm back from my vacation in Tucson, AZ and feeling jet-lagged for the first time in years. Fun Fun. Before I post about the highlights of my trip, I wanted to tie up a loose end. I think my last post was kinda wordy and I'm not even sure if it was inteligible, so freshly culled from  urlLink this  article in the National Review, my sentiments but better written:  "How many times have we been told that George W. Bush "squandered" the good will of the world "community" after 9/11? The assumption behind all of this seemed to be that anything which cost America the support of allies like France or Germany was, in effect, too costly. In other words, the means — "strong alliances" — are more important than the ends — winning the war on terror, toppling Saddam, and so forth. Listening to these folks, one gets the sense that America's greatest foreign-policy triumph was to get sucker-punched on 9/11 because it resulted in sympathetic newspaper headlines in Paris and Berlin."
