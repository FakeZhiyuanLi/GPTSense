      This makes day four for glo-blog and there is no evidence that anyone has visited. I feel so unloved. Is it too much to ask to get maybe a hello comment to say "I'm watching"? After all, you never know when I'll post someting weird like this -> urlLink http://members.cox.net/lxix/ithurts/  if you click them, they will confuse you.

      yet another listless summer day. Today I played through Ico in about three hours, figured out how to remove an anoying auto-loggin my sister left on the computer, burned two cd's, ate the last of the cucumber salad and talked to a very polite man from T-online for about 23 seconds. Hope tommorow goes just as well.

      Critical Event: Today it was nessecary for myself to be in bamberg for a dentist appointment. The conditions that led to this akwardly timed appoinment are somewhat stupid on my behalf so I will not divulge them. Anyway seeing as it would have been tedious for a parental unit to drive to the haus and back into the stadt It was proclaimed that I should take THE BUS... (insert jarring chords here) THE BUS leaves Zettmannsdorf at 2:37pm only, so naturally I needed to set my alarm to make sure I'm awake at least at 1:00pm. "12:00 should do it" I say to myself. 12:00 at night the alarm goes off. I turn off the alarm and go back to sleep cursing my oversight. Pretty soon after that, around 7:00 (that's two minutes in dream time), I realize the alarm has not been set again. Oh, well I'm hungry anyways. After eating I go back to sleep. At 1:00 I wake up with something like a panic, again I forgot to reset the alarm, D'oh! I "quickly" fix myself some fried eggs and soda, dress, grab my stuff and get out the door at 2:15pm. My nerves at this point are shot. Chapter 2: THE BUS So now I'm at the appx. 90 degree BUS stop waiting for THE BUS about 20 minutes before it is due. So I wait......... and wait...........still wai-ting.......2:40 something and here's THE BUS! "$#*# BUS at least in THE BUS the air will be moving" HA HA. Ha...ha........ no. ten miutes into THE BUS RIDE I feel like my eggs earlier when they were cooking. Twenty minutes into THE BUS RIDE, I reeeaally regreted eating my eggs earlier. Thirty minutes into THE BUS RIDE I'm "scrambling" to keep my eggs and soda from earlier. When at last I get into the stadt I feel like the dentist will need to watch out when inspecting my mouth. Ah! But the dentist's office is in a stone building. Soooo coooooool...... I enjoy the dentist appointment greatly but it is over too soon. Chapter Three: God ^$#^%#*^$* dammit! So anyway I end up at Father's office feeling a great joy on his cold floor and a great need to relive myself of the eggs. Wphoo! At closing time we all get in the car and start in the  direction  of home (YES!) but suddenly mother asks "So where do you want to eat?"  (!!^%%^^R&TY$#^%E%W$^%E^%&amp;T^^HJYHF^R^^&&amp; ) Not only did my eggs leave me feeling less than dandy in the digestive department but I was tired and hot and sweaty (and smelly) to boot! Anyway we go downtown. Mum and Dad get doners (a wonderful thing if you're hungry, TOTAL HELL if you're not) whilst I drink my drink in misery. Is that all? NOOOOOOO! Just as we start driving home there is a great Thunder and the biggest downpour of the year hits the car with the seeming sound of thousands of people laughing. I hate my luck.
