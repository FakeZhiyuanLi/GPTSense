       Feeling:Sad Hearing:"Black Balloon" by Goo Goo Dolls  I'm sad,I haven't talked to my boyfriend all day.I hope that he isn't ignoring me.I think I have pissed all of my friends off by going on about how I really wanted to talk to him.I've had a pretty bad day as it is.I broke something that belonged to my mother and I got upset about it and took some pieces of it back to my room and cut myself with it,my own personal form of punishment.Other than that,all I've done is eat and sulk from lack of nothing else better to do.My friends,Christian and Lindsey are fighting again x.x I like both of them and I hate seeing them fight and I hate it even more when I have to lie to one of them about the other.I wish that they would just get along instead of acting like two year olds,still arguing about something that took place months ago.In addition,I did manage to get my book that I was reading done today.It's called "Drive Me Wild" by Vicki Lewis Thompson.It was really good.Eh,it's getting late so I think I'll end now and get some sleep,maybe tomorrow will be a better day.I want my baby....

       Feeling:Somewhat Happy Hearing:"She Will Be Loved" By Maroon 5  As you can probably tell from the title,my name's Brittany,I'm 14 years old(about to be 15 woohoo!),and I live in Wilmington,North Carolina.I go to Laney High School,about to be a sophmore.Like most girls my age,I do have a boyfriend,his name is Austin and I love him more than anyone can even begin to imagine.Anywho,I do have one doggie,a cocker spaniel named Ruby.I almost never call her that however,I mostly refer to her as Bippy (don't ask).I have mousy brown hair (the results of highlighting once) and brown eyes,how boring.I like to read,listen to music,write,dance,hang out with friends,surf the net,and shop,shop,SHOP!!!  As for my taste in music,I like almost everything,pop,rock,techno,dance,metal,rap..depending on my mood.Some of my favorite songs are "You Are My Dream" by Bambee,"Not That Kinda Girl" by JoJo,"Sugarboy" by Papaya,"Boys" by Smile.DK,and "Vibrate" by Petey Pablo..the list goes on!!  I've covered my music tastes,now for my literature tastes,lol.I love mostly trashy and romantic novels,although I do enjoy a good horror or mystery every once in a while.My favorite authors are Kathleen Woodiwiss,Eugenia Price,Jackie Collins,LaVryle Spencer,and The Queen Of Romance (in my opinion lol) Danielle Steel.  Eh,by now I think I've bored you enough,lol.That covers my little introduction about myself.^.^
