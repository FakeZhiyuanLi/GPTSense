      Today I spent most of my day at home after my adventure outside my house at 9am. Skipped the Mediquiz training, I did not want to ruin my holiday by not doing things for myself. In view of the SRS project, I searched pet shop after pet shop, nursery after nursery, and I finally found CATNIP! I felt so accomplished after finally finding it, I guess the harder the journey, the more trying the process, the greater the satisfaction, the fanfare and ecstasy when the job gets done.  I spent the rest of the day contemplating, meditating, and shooting the heads off bots in Unreal. The day went by just like that as I thought of the mysteries of life. I thought about why people act the way they do, I thought about what my purpose on this world was, in the big and small picture, I thought of my past, pondered the present, and envisioned the future. In short I did a lot, a lot of deep stuff with myself.  Life has never been easy. If it was, why would some people choose to call it the greatest tragedy? Is it all but a mockery of death? However, why do some people come out of life as successful individuals with smiles on their faces, but the rest just fade away into the darkness, not making a difference.  The secret must therefore lie in the difference. How should difference be achieved then? We are all human, with two eyes, two ears, one mouth, one nose, and basically the same physical traits, though it cannot be said for some of us, of which my sympathies do lie, the larger human population is still very much physically alike, discounting faces. Hence the secret must lie within the heart.  If one looks at life as a hunt, it will be a hunt. The process will become the thrill of the hunt, and the goals will become the prey. If life was a cruise, the journey will be the rests between each trying port and pit stop. I have always firmly believed, that "Man creates, fate dictates", quoting myself, the thing is that destiny always begins, in one's hands.  The sacred Choice. To do or not to do. Very often we blame others for our failures, or we blame the world for being unkind, or we would curse fate and say that destiny is unjust. Are we being petty in this case? Have we actually thought about the choices involved. If one chooses not to come into this world, would we? If one chooses not to embark on the journey, would we? It is all about our own choices and the consequences they bear, not that the world owed us justice.  "The world does not owe you a living, after all it came first." Wise words from Mark Twain. We cannot blame anyone but ourselves for landing ourselves into predicament. To do so means to deny that we believed in our choices. Have we lost faith in ourselves by blaming everyone else? Why not make the best out of each situation? Why do we always look toward the negative, and forget that very often, the positive is within reach, by just stretching out our hands, we may grasp the honey of life?  I do understand that it is tough to look away from the negative, and reach out toward the positive. Though mathematically they are separated by one line, in life, that one line could embody a mile. The journey back may be tough, but it tests one's faith and strength. To hold on to the last moment is not just proving to yourself that you can do whatever you put your mind too, but it also celebrates the strength of the human spirit.  Why were humans not given the speed of the cheetah, the cunning of the wolf, the strength of a bear? We were compensated with something more beautiful than all of that. The mind. The mind is limitless and boundless. It is from there which the light bulb was spawned, it is there where world records are conceived, where theories are developed. Where comes such divine strength as marathon runners push themselves to the limit? It is truly the infinite power of the mind that embodies the true spirit of being human.   Think of light... And you see light.   In a child's mind, we see the beginnings of a destiny. We see hopes, wishes and dreams. Why do we seem to lose those as we grow up? Is it a bane or a boon to lose all those as we find our niche in the modern world?  As we become individuals, it becomes almost impossible to find someone else with exactly the same hopes, dreams and wants. Success is defined a million times by a million people. We try to seek other individuals with similar hopes and dreams, but we often realize that at the end of the day, the person in the mirror is yourself. You have to face your own consequences.  Hence the importance of thinking for oneself. I may sound very selfish here, but if we look into ourselves, we will realize that man, thought gifted with thought, is very selfish by nature. Who would not fight to protect their loved ones or possessions? It is selfishness that causes man to continually improve, to seek higher limits, to fight. To actually talk about universal love would be useless unless one knows how to take care of oneself.  It would be utter foolishness to mention about taking care about others, when one cannot even take care of oneself. Are you being considerate in that case, if you cannot help others take care of their problems in the end, but you give people false hope that you would by showing a helping hand? We see people who are so caught up in caring for others that they forget about themselves. Such is the beauty and the foolishness of the human being.   Do think before you act.   This brings us back to the mind again. With all our ideals, what is the use of determination and the aggressiveness to stand for our ideals when we can't think fulfilling them? We often get lost in this world and we begin to question our ideals as we get to know other people. However why do we find the need to question if belief is all that is and was required? We find the need to think about the ideals that we have, to see them for their realism, not their idealism. What are great ideals if we can't find a facet for them to be transformed into reality?   I feel very sad when I see people reaching out to others, but neglecting themselves in the name of their ideals. As they waste themselves away, I wonder if they would have enough time to see their ideals through.  The world is cruel. If one does not learn to think, then one has truly failed oneself, one's friends and families, one's hopes, and one's ideology.  I see myself 15 years from now, married with 3 children. I see myself with a networth of 30 million. I see myself a overworked, but happy man. I see my wife as a wonderful lady with the sophistication of a aristocrat, but who knows how to enjoy the simpler things in life. I see her as a wonderful cook, and I see many happy hours that I can spend with her in the kitchen, and playing her favourite piano pieces near a fireplace when it is all snowing outside. I see her as an intellectual lady with a beautiful mind of her own, who can give me logic, yet allow me to smother her with emotion.   I see...   Dreams. Hopes. Wants. What are they without making a move to realize them. What are they if one does not live, breathe, eat and drink the dream. What are we if we are not defined by them? Don't tell me two people have the same ideals, because at the end of the day, we are all unique.  Grow up if you have not. As one lets go of the past, roots oneself in the present and then embraces the future, then one can finally say, I am not dreaming, I vision. Clinging on to the insubstantial things, and you will know what they are, will not help you in one bit. Look around you. There are many lights, all you have to do is to reach out and grab one.  We come into this world not finding the perfect person to love, but learning to love the imperfect person.  To Huiwen, EQ, Joy, Deb, Fruz, ET:  My sword and service will lie with all of you, always.  To Ming, Chee, Qadir, Colin:  My good comrades, I look forward to battling alongside you guys, for a long while.   Have faith. Believe like you have never believed before.   <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>  To make you happy is what I want, To keep you forever in my heart, To cherish, to love, to hold you there, before, after, now, and then, till the day that my air is spent.  Life is a bed of roses when you are there, you make the thorns seem so easy to bear, my strength to fight lies in your love, you give me the resolve to soar above.  I cannot tell what the future holds, but one thing I do know, I love you with all my heart and soul, To be there to share your weal and woe.  <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>

      Clinging onto the material realities of life, we often forget to see the hearts that reach out to us. We neglect these people, and we cause them hurt. Is it right? To let go of the present needs in place of future wants?  We do not know what the future holds, but what I can be sure is that the future begins now. In the meantime, just as we wait and hope, do we not look upon the tasks on the present, the musts, and perform them to the best of out abilities? Do we really look forward to having being a class for 2 years and in the end we do not have the slightest hint of our class mates's personality?   It would be very sad.   To forgive is the greatest gift of man. To show mercy is to give universal love. I love you... and nothing, absolutely nothing will take that away from me.  I love you all. I always will.

      Tonight I went to watch my juniors perform at EDS night back at Dunman. The performance was not fantastic as expected, but it was fun nonetheless, to look at them and wonder whether you were once this way too. Don't know what to think, feel or say now. I feel drained.  Perhaps I have let off so much steam. Walking into the darkness I long for someone to be there for me, to pour my troubles into. I want to fight, live, die in grand passion. I want to live it up, to give my soul to someone worthy. The ultimate union between a man and a woman. Unfortunately, in today's context, life rushes by so fast, I wonder how remote the chances are of finding such a person.  I am not gifted with great looks, so I can't make people swoon over me. What I have to offer is alot of heart, to people whom I respect and love. However, it seems to me that the animal attraction somehow manages to overpower the other senses in people. It is so shallow that one goes for physical perfection when in reality, no one is perfect. Instead of dreaming of perfection, why don't people look beyond that and into the present business of getting to know the people around you better?   Lust.   Why chase... Is it fun to go after, to crave, the impossible? Sure you can dream, but dreaming must be limited to visions. Dreaming of the impossible may be the essence of creation, but dreaming of the impossible and doing nothing but whining and complaining makes you a big fool.   To be continued...

      Today I had another half day off. It was fun, going out with ET, Aini, and Fruz. Not to mention Hattata, Qadir, Chee Hau and Wing. It was a very enjoyable, and it made my day, thanks everyone! Oh yea... I have not had hiccups in such a long while... it was fun to say hello to this long lost friend again... and the laughter, smiling. Welcome back!  It was sad to say good bye so prematurely, but I had music lessons, and I absolutely had to go because my piano lessons are very important to me... they have become like an outlet to let go of myself, let my inner music flow through my fingers. When I am at the piano, I feel myself as a whole, an individual making the music of my soul. My fingers become the instrument, and they dance the dance of danger, the dance of excitement across the keys of black and white. I count myself very blessed because though I cannot sing with my voice, I can sing with my fingers. Hope some inspiration hits me soon, so I can write a new song for a lucky lady.  My thoughts wander to today's outing again... and I feel somehow, lost. It feels so split up, our class. It feels like there are so many clans inside one class. There is the Weishan clan consisting of Xiu Wen, Qi Mei, Vivian. There is the PRC partnership with Lizi. The Deborah Clique with Wen Ling and perhaps Hatta, and maybe... emphasise maybe me. The Brotherhood of Ming Hui, including me, Chee, Qadir and perhaps Wing Hong. The Jian Li connection with Chin Bock, Haixi. The Minas... ET, Aini and Fruz. The rest... I really don't know what to say... they seem like lone rangers.  With Wen Ling becoming a house captain, it seems that she has become more and more distant. Maybe it was not such a good idea to vote for her. In the beginning she was already hanging out with Kyrin, Chris and Venus... but it has gotten almost ethereal. Can anyone actually know what she is feeling nowadays? It makes me sad, and she is dragging Deb along with her... it makes me all the more sadder. I mean, if you can't even mix well with your class and you start running outside, what does that make you?  Call me conservative or selfish. I don't care. This is my blog, my 2 cents, and I am going to say what I like.   I call it disgusting.   Thats why I admire and respect Ming. He has something many people lack. He has a mind of his own.... I am not the first one to notice this trend in the class, he wrote an email before this. Has the situation improved? Ever so slightly. How much do we know about our classmates? These people who we might be counting on in the future? No way! No way will I place my life in anyone else's hands unless that hand has touched my heart and earned my respect.  This situation stinks. It absolutely reflects the situation between a certain someone and me right now. She would rather tell her problems to someone else than tell me. What, you see me as too weak to take your criticism? I am stronger than your think. Think it will make me feel better when you start ignoring me without a reason, then you come around, explain things, ask me to forgive you, but at the same time you make no move to try improve the situation? I am tired of trying to get to you. It felt like I was talking to a wall the past few days, don't expect me to expend myself into such... unfruitful ventures.  I still can't believe she did this to me. She would rather speak about the problem behind my back than to tell me directly. You might call it kindness, but I prefer to call it hypocrism, the art of speaking behind someone's back to a finesse.  It hurts when everyone knows except you. It hurts when a person suddenly withdraws and you don't know why. It hurts to keep guessing, to keep trying, and making no progress.  Why must I always be kept in the dark by the people I love? Why? Will the truth hurt that much... as compared to being dealt the blow at the last possible moment and left to die? Must the world know about every affair before I am informed? All I asked in return for my trust is a bit of trust on the other side. I feel betrayed. I feel alone...   Enough.    If I have come to learn a truth, it is that life does not revolve around love. I have almost lost all faith in that word. After all I have been hurt twice in 3 months by 2 ladies who I loved alot.    We shall see. We shall see. I hate to make prophecies of darkness anyway.   When one lives one's life throughout without thinking about oneself, to follow the herd in every move, to be so emotional that it hinders one's progress. I pity those people. If you are what you think, and you don't use your mental faculty to think, then what does that make you, nothing? Would you rather be a mindless freak to live through life, drifting away, and losing control?  Take control now. Don't waste your life bumping around like that. It desecrates the purpose and sacredness of life. You might as well die if you can't think for yourself, and have your own opinions. I might have bruised many egos and feelings today, but I frankly don't give a damn because I don't have the mildest respect for these people at this point of time.  I have three sentences for these people...   Trash. Get thrown away. Do us a service and cleanse humanity.

      Faith is such a beautiful thing. It is a gift shared between two individuals that care and cherish each other, it is a promise to be there for each other. When in that instant it is broken... it slices, especially to the party who places the heart on the line.  It has always been that way. I seem to be a sociable kind of guy... very extroverted. Most people get the shock of their lives when they hear I am an INTP (Introverted, Intuive, Thinking, Percieving) person. They start giving me the "are you sure?" kind of look that says... you must be lying.  Perhaps it has not been noticed... but I am a very shy person out of school. I rarely speak during class outings. To me, outside of my work domain, I revert to my quiet self. In a bus, I have alot of awkward moments with my friends because they suddenly notice that I turn quiet. I find it difficult to express myself outside of school, except through music...   Talking about music, it has been a long time since I began playing the piano. I remember I was just 4 when I started on the piano. I knew the moment when I felt the keys under my fingers that I could do it. It has been a long way since then, and though I am not sure whether I play fantastically good, or whether I am entertaining enough, but the piano has always been my companion through sun and rain.  Different pianos speak to me differently. Some of them require forcefulness to make them sound, while others respong better to soft coaxing. In that sense, pianos are very much like people, there is music in every one of us, it is how one expresses oneself that makes the music melodious or simply discordant.  I haven't felt this way since I was dumped. It is a eating vacuum, a black hole that threatens to consume everything I stand for. The mind abhors a vacuum, and I felt totally in disharmony with myself, my heart and mind going in different directions. Luckily for me, I have felt the warmth of people who do care about me... and it has been comforting to notice how much I actually mean to them. To actually know, to actually feel that I matter to them, makes me feel glad.  I don't feel like going into essays tonight, so I shall be writing a little something. On paper of course.  You make me sad, then no effort is made to make me happier again. Shows how much I actually mean to you huh? You would deceive my heart once, and thats all the chance you will get. No more.  I will be no fool anymore. I will see no more illusions. Don't believe me? Try me. Push the button, and suffer the wrath. It will hurt no doubt, but after all, you did ask for it.  By Newton's third law, you can only push so much before the reaction happens. That applies to people too. Tread carefully. Peace.   Tomorrow begins today. Weaken not, lest the darkness consumes thee. Please don't work against me, because it will be the last thing you probably ever do. Don't want too much blood on my hands(or teeth), but if I have to, I will. So Don't.   ~Lupine Dormeins Nunquam Titillandus~

      Today I look into myself and view my past. Being the bully victim I was, I did contemplate suicide at one point, even at the tender age of 7. It was dark times, those days where you dread going to school, and no one would believe you. It was also then I learnt to become smarter, faster, stronger... I learnt to project myself as a domineering figure. I shed alot of tears during that time, because it was a time when I really felt lost and hopeless, a time when I felt the world had forsaken me.   I learnt to fight back.   I still shudder whenever I look back into those times. It was those days that shaped the present me... the me with the strive for perfection, the immovable conviction, the sharp and critical words. I admit I am not universally popular, but if anyone needs a frank and clear direction, I am you man.  How many times has it been, when I start to become critical and direct, especially when a matter is at hand, that other people have shunned me? They think that I see myself as superior, they think I want to put them down and pressure them just for the sake of seeing their tortured looks. They think I want to be proud and untouchable, to be above all... to savour the moment of triumph over others. They feel that I am arrogant, ignorant of my weaknesses, fallible, egoistic.   Sorry, thats the wrong answer.    I very well know my limits. I work hard every breathing moment, to improve my body, mind and soul. To gain the credits of arrogance, to be able to achieve over others, do you think it is an overnight job? Do you think I managed to write so well because I am gifted. I do admit I am multi-talented, thanks to my parents, but did I achieve what I have overnight?  Who knows about the tears I have shed, writing, writing non-stop. The ink and graphite all over my hands, the paper strewn all over. The books I devoured voraciously, night after night of continued, persistant reading... once I managed to read a book non-stop for 24 hours without stopping at all. The me of today is a boy who grew up amidst struggles, who grew up on the cane, who grew up against a such emotional odds.    Stop telling me I am arrogant, or proud... I am proud of what I am today. I have all the right to be.    Not to mention the incredible foresight I am gifted with. I think it is a blessed talent to be able to think, not just about the present but being able to actually see the evolution into the future. I see pictures, visions, of great things... everything I set out to do, I have a picture in my head. Unfortunately, people often condemn my visions. In the end... How many times have I seen that look, 'perhaps I should have listened to you, sigh it is too late now, sorry to drag you into this mess.' Then I look back, and I berate myself for not trying harder to prevent this problem, after all I did envision it, perhaps I was not convincing enough to sway people to believe me.    I must suffer always... it is all my fault.   Why can't people just listen? Will it kill someone to see perfection as I see it? Why can't someone just believe in my vision... because I have Seen, and perfection is within our grasp, as long as we work toward it. I know people may feel very skeptical about my ability, but just as I have learnt to see people, I have learnt to see things... and I am rarely wrong, as some can attest.  It hurts to be accused, it hurts even more when the person you would defend unto death says that she has the same belief. Finally I see what everyone has been saying behind my back, that I am an arrogant bastard. Finally I manage to see the true colours... of people whom I thought I could share a part of me. Thanks for taking me for granted. Thanks for standing on a side that I never believe possible, because I thought you really understood me.  I am looking for reassurance of my purpose. Has anyone given that to me? No. Don't blame me for my attitude... it is who I am, and it is my comfort in this world, where I have lost hope in people close to me. I have been hurt, too many times, by people who I thought I could sacrifice my entire being for. It hurts so bad.    I am tearing now, but who understands the heart that has been sliced open? Does my sadness make you happy? The arrogant bastard you all thought of has real emotions underneath all that hype. When I thought I could ease the bleeding from my past, now comes another cut that incises into my very soul...   Guess I really don't mean anything to anyone. Guess I was a fool to actually think someone could understand me for what I am, not what I appear to be, to always believe in what my inner self, after all they have seen it. Guess I trusted the wrong person once again. Again and again, cut by the person I would value most. I try to be myself in front of my closest buddies, and at the turn of the moment they would believe malicious words said of me. They would tell me that I was of poor character. I cannot believe... that someone close to me would think the worse of me, even with a majority view that I am such...  Superficial... and I thought love would transcend such superficiality. I have yet seen someone with enough capacity to do so... to actually break past my outer case, to see me for what I am, the child in the corner, crying, wanting the care, love and attention that he has been deprived of. If one still sees only the boy with the big ego, and would judge me based on it... I cannot believe this would happen.   I have been made the fool once again...    It is once again all my fault. I will heal, but that broken unspoken trust, it will take me a long time before I can start giving again. Never mind. There will always be better people to give my love and trust to. After all I don't believe that no one will be able to see past my appearance, to see my soul...  To ET and Fruz: I don't think that you would think of me as arrogant right? I do have a side that just wants to warm and nice. Please. See past that arrogance... it will be terribly disappointing if you see me in much the same light too. Especially Fruz. Pardon my indulgence in showing off. Self-praise, is usually the only kind of praise I ever get. Thanks for trying to cheer me up with your comments, it really shows how much both of you actually care for me. Alot. I cherish your effort... Thanks for bothering about me. =)  A rhyme dedicated to ET and Fruz:   Thanks for always being there, Thanks for giving me a ear to spare, Thanks for showing that you care, Thanks for being the roses in the air.  This is short and sweet, and it is no where deep, but no words can ever mean, the concern I have seen, from the words you placed on my screen.     ~specialis aeternus~

      Today I wore a the house tee to school. I still remember how the math lecturer picked me out from the crowd because of the "red shirt". Haha... for a tutor lecturing vectors, she has definitely poor notions of what is front and back. Maybe "middle" does not exist in her vocabulary.  It was a rather interesting day. Finally I got to realise what is wrong with the group file. I also feel quite pitiful about the Tay... it is not that he wants to be such a conservative protocol person, but the teaching line is one that is really filled with such sickening and disgusting rules. I also appreciate his effort to work closely with my group on improving the standards of the file. Thanks very much.  I still firmly believe PW is a idiotic subject. I guess its Shi Yuan to the rescue again with the PW file. No offense to my other group members, but I am usually a solitary warrior, and if I want to get things done, I usually do it on my own. I know it does not sound very friendly, or very co-operative, but that is how I work. I have always had this problem because I have very high standards in whatever thing I engage in, and it is not anyone's fault when other people don't reach my standards, so I have to carve it out on my own, no hard feelings? I still think my group members are a creative and willing bunch, however when it comes to handling reports and documentation, that is my arena, and I can trust no one to do it better.  The day was fairly smooth flowing, and I enjoyed the mellowed pace. Had alot of fun doing SPA this round, I exasperated Mrs. Choo so much that she actually said "Can already la...". It was a challenge really, making a neutralised solution using only two beakers of solution and a bit of estimation.  Good news! She is taking over as Chem tutor when Miss Siow leaves, which means we won't be fed to some funny Chem tutor who won't fit into our class style. YES!  I am still wondering about my Physics SPA, hopefullly I did well. I am aiming on averaging a 6 for every SPA test, so I can score at least 15%. The rest, will be pure mugging on the main paper. Guess it is time to push my drive to 80%. I guess I have been functioning on 60% too long already...  I was speaking to a very beautiful and intelligent lady after the SPA, and we were talking about my perceptions of love. I gained certain insight about what she felt about the topic, and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience of speaking to her. Met ET on the way home, but I was on the phone, so I did not get to say a proper good bye. Sorry...  THERE COMES A TIME WHEN A MAN MUST TAKE UP IS ARMS AND DO BATTLE. THERE IS A TIME WHEN A MAN MUST PROVE HIMSELF WORTHY OF THE TITLE OF HERO. THERE IS A TIME WHEN A MAN MUST BRING HIS MIND, BODY AND SOUL TO BEAR ON THE TASK AHEAD. THE TIME IS NOW. BEHOLD THE BIRTH OF GLORY TO COME! FEAR ME DLSY... FOR YOUR DREAM ENDS. NOW.  whatdoyoudowhenshiyuancomesforyouandwantstotakeyourlifeaway?nothingbecausenomatterhowhardyoutryyourfatewillbesealed.  Pray. Pray real hard DLSY... if heaven will pity your cold-blood... it has begun. There will be blood spilled on the paper, and I will make sure it is both of yours. This I promise both of you with all my heart.     Smile while the both of you can. It makes it all so much more statisfying to see you try to smile through those tears that you will shed. Real soon.     It boils down to this moment. What do you do?    Run the race, and may the least hopeless man win.    kaht kärbest ühe hoobiga. kartma mina... jaa...

      Today is such a WONDERFUL day! It was long and boring... but still it was a fantastic day because I have been feeling rather low lately. Only let-down was the "mercury-in-grass". It stinks la... this thing they call PW. He look at me like it is my fault that the file was not in proper order... and he TRIED to look disappointed and fierce. Like I cared how he felt about the file... he is such a loser... he needs his wife to look at our proposals. I found out only because I saw two different hand-writings on my group's proposal... and one of them looked distinctly female and did not belong to him.  I really wish to get PW over and done with. I mean... just give me the Band 1 and we can part amicably. What do you expect me to do with my group? Salman is almost always busy with his CCA, Ye Dan and Wei Shan with their own stuff... and I have my own worries too. I wished I was a "Sheru" la... got so much time on my hands to study and do PW.  I was thinking about the meaning of PW and all after what eLe Choy said... some things we are compelled to do for our own good. Like CIP. I really don't mind CIP. After all I am doing something meaningful, making a difference out there to the community, doing a good deed. PW pales in comparison. You just have to sit down and then you realise the redundancy of it all.   It is utter stupidity. You want us to learn how to do research, how to be more organised with material and all that... fine, thats all good, and I appreciate PW honing my skils in these areas. But come to think again... with all those guidelines... are we really doing what is right? Creating a generation of young people who cannot work without guidelines? As the stupid government tell us to step out... I really wonder what the hell they are doing by imposing even more damn guidelines on us. Please, who needs them to run my life, to teach me how to do my research, to try to control my every move, to be marked against standards that are supposedly for my own good.  Damn them to hell. Damn them all the way to hell. Same goes for SPA. Who gives a damn how you do your research in a lab? How many of us actually aspire to work inside a laboratory, 24 hours a day, looking at test tubes and white walls. I may enjoy it, but I seriously doubt that this is the sentiment of the majority.  Stop complaining about youths not being able to step out of the comfort zone. Stop telling us that we are not hungry. Ask yourselves, have you created an environment that will encourage this stepping-out? Have you, the stupid government which literally consumes so much tax-payer money each year done anything to feed that hunger, to make youths of today more determined to strive?  What they have succeeded is creating a worthless rat-race with so many rules and regulations that it is not the people who have the smarts and the drive who turn out the to be the most successful. At the end of the day, these people are just regarded is the mavericks, the rebels against the standards, the case for the self-centred adolescent. People who stick by the rules will die by the rules. Mark my words. Protocol will keep one safe for only so long, and the darkness will consume one once the protocol, the rules are removed.  Sometimes it is so exasperating to get things across to our block-head of a CT tutor. Physics limits the mind... or so it seems in his case. I thought it was a science that allows people to continue and strive to explain why things happen... apparently the people after Einstein have little notion about that. The only job suitable for block-head people now is basically being a kopitiam boy... definitely suits the name, but I think he can't take more than one order at one time, after all, his memory stinks. LOSER!  With that tay@kopitiamhock out of the way, lets continue saying why today rocked. I haven't laughed as much, or even seen so many people smile as much, as I have seen today! I love all of you guys! You rock my world! Kudos to Ming Hui, Qadir, Chee Hau, and not forgetting the star of the day Wing Hong!  Hey ladies, you were not too bad either... sorry about the hairy poem... but I had to get it out of my system, or else it would start to bug me, and I would probably start babbling about it. Its not to be disgusting or anything la... but we boys... I dare not say men (yet?), have a common perception that teenage girls should be typically quite bare down there? (rhymes sia...)  Still no mark improvement in interaction with her. I wonder if I have suddenly lost all conversation topics with her. Nevermind. I have learnt to have to let go... what will be meant to be, will be. What is not yours, no point chasing. Quite contridicting, especially since I am such a firm believer in creating your fate, but I guess such things must take a measure of destiny too. I am not very sure of what I want too... so why bog myself down with all these thoughts?   Let your heart go, and the body will follow.     'I hefted the heavy war-axe in my hand, feeling the weight which I found rather reassuring. There would be blood spilled today, and I could not help but feel uneasy about the coming battle. I had to be strong for my men though, and that settled it. "To arms!" I cried in a voice that shook awareness into all the soldiers. Shield and spear were raised in unison to my command. They were all men of fine caliber, and I was honoured to be leading them into battle.  "Knights, prepare for charge on my call!" Lances were lifted from the ground, and I buckled my axe before raising my lance. Visors down, shields up, the knights presented an awe-inspiring aura that brought hope to the men behind.  "FORWARD MARCH!" I coaxed my steed into a slow trot, a beautiful beast he was, black as the night, and brave as any seasoned warrior. Flags fluttering, we marched, toward the heat of battle, and perhaps uncertain death.'      Nemesis    urlLink

      Saturn Opposition Midheaven      This can be a difficult placement, indicating that you feel so lonely and so different from others that it is hard to relate to them. You need a great deal of emotional support from your family. Your mother, especially, may demand a great deal and expect you to live up to very high standards, without giving you very much emotional reinforcement.   One possible effect of this placement is that you will be very active socially. You are trying to escape from your sense of inadequacy through others. However, the only way that you can really conquer this feeling is by going inside, confronting yourself and accepting what you are.

       "I could see dust in the horizon. Scouts earlier had reported a large enemy sighted about a day's march from the fort. They were packing catapaults. Not a good sign. They were here for a seige... and it was approaching winter. This would be a hard-fought seige.  We had to strike first to elminate as much opposition as possible. The plan was to go at the catapaults before retreating, letting the archers pick off any fool that dared to give chase."   Today was SPA skill A,C,D... I am not very confident about the outcome, but who knows? Exams are just so unpredictable, especially if you are like me. :P  Anyway, with that out of the picture, PW, my SRS  project and the mid-years are looming up. Chain reaction?   Join up, they said, its a man's life they said, go places, see the world...   Well the damn world sucks... or else there would not be this thing call gravity. The 9.81 N/kg, the 9.81 m/s2 downwards... so much force... but for what? I laugh...  Rather disappointing day... slept late last night. Afternoon nap compensated some, but I am thinking about what happened this afternoon at parkway. It was enjoyable no doubt... but I wonder, why the name of someone else was called instead of mine. Perhaps I don't really mean a thing. Its not that I don't want to speak to her... but circumstances forbid me. I have considerations too... and its like everytime I try to approach her something happens to prevent it from happening.  Getting quite exasperated with those things that happen. If only I could... Not that I don't want to speak to you... But you too popular. How to? No wonder they say you are everyone's best friend... *sigh*  Sorry Eng Tze, not that I want to run away from carrying your bag and be anti-social... have to help out at home, so I had to go... but you can believe my promises. I said I would get you a daisy, and I will get you one... even if it means raiding every flower bed to get one.   Call me... don't be afraid... so just call me.

      The necessity to contemplate is once again upon me... I think and review my actions once again...   I have always had a streak of competitiveness, a desire and drive to win. Sometimes people ask me whether winning is everything. Perhaps to them it isn't, but to me, winning, the ecstasy, the roar of triumph... I live for that moment, and my entire being centres upon bringing that moment into reality.  Since young, I have always had this problem with self-confidence... it took me 3 years before I decided to revolutionse my life and open up to the world. Even now, whenever I do new experiments, take on new challenges... my hand trembles. Once in secondary school, I was taking part in this oratorical contest... and my hands just trembled throughout my speech without me noticing.  I live on praise. I thrive in conditions that raise my profile. Hence I strive to be the very best in my field, to be unmatched, to be at the top and let everyone gaze up to me, and wonder, "How the hell did he ever get up there?"  Then I laugh...   I find that I have become more and more withdrawn, quiet even, in the past few days. Its not that I want to suppress myslef, show my more mature side... but I am tired. I tire of the responsibilities that I take upon myself without thinking. Me and my big mouth. Oh well, I am a very capable, talented and intelligent boy to begin with, so tasks are no big deal... it is just that, has anyone given a damn about how I am coping? I don't need anyone to share in my tasks... I enjoy challenges. I just need someone to be there so I can have some emotional support... someone that I can always turn to and in that instant the person will respond with a smile that will wipe my worries away.    There is only so much I can smile before my tears start to flow again... Does anyone know or even care what I want?    So many ladies in my life, but I always have to share them. I am a selfish person... I just have to keep on having guys that intrude into my territory... some guys are fine, especially if their names are Qadir, Chee Hau or Ming Hui... well, Salman sometimes... but otherwise... if I want to sit beside a girl during lectures, and suddenly you cut in front of me and plant your bag and butt there... I will be damn pissed.  So don't. Don't ever insult my intelligence, my family, my friends... and don't ever intrude into my life. I will eat you alive if you ever do. You have been warned.  I am still so put off by a certain person... Who the hell is he to start stealing my ladies and not sharing them back? Now... the only real solace I can get is with Ming Hui and Chee Hau. Enough. He is suave no doubt, more funny no doubt, physically stronger, perhaps mentally smarter... so he can start stealing them. Fine. Take them if you can... I don't need people who would run away at the slightest temptation around me. I will love those that remain... cleaning out the riff-raff.    Being solitary... being so lonely... perhaps that would be my calling... to be the lone hunter.    Don't worry, I will keep my promises. What I have said, I will do. I still have my honour to keep, a strong arm to protect, courage to battle, and a sword to fight on with... Don't underestimate the Bladesinger demonhunters, thats probably the last thing people usually do. Pitiful, really.  If you place your heart with me... rest assured that I will help it grow and protect it with my life. If you place your trust with me... rest assured I will never break it and I will make it stronger. If you place your hand in mine... rest assured I will take it to the stars with mine... and smile as your eyes gaze into mine.    Love is the only inspiration...     Lying on a large field, I look up, and see, A milliion stars winking at me, like once upon a time -- When I held your gaze in mine.  Touch-me-not, Love-lies-deep, Bluebells ring, lilies weep. Roses redder than crimson blood, is Grand Passion, nothing but a big facade?   There is no greater force in this world than love. No greater gift than sacrifice... all I ask is for some love and understanding... Tread carefully.   Thank you Ming Hui... for always being the first. Thank you Fairuz... for sharing. Thank you Aini... for giving. Thank you Deborah... you will always be beautiful to me no matter what I or anyone else says ( same goes for Fairuz, though in a different way ). Thank you Qadir... we have weathered fire and rain together, good job my comrade and my buddy. Thanks Wen Ling, for being eternally stoned where I can see you, unmoving support? I love all of you...  I haven't forgotten you Eng Tze... I will get you your flower... soon. Hope to get to know you better though...    Smile. You will see the world through smaller eyes that way, and may you see all the good stuff only.

       Sun in Virgo, Moon in Leo    Inwardly you have the characteristics of prudence, common sense, and practicality. Your outward personality, however, appears as ardent, passionate, and aggressive. You have a tendency to involve yourself in activities that are not harmonious with your innate characteristics.   The rulership of Virgo makes you a hard-working, practical, foresighted person who is fond of cleanliness and privacy. Externally, the Moon in Leo will place you in positions in which you must exert authority in a positive and clear manner. In love you are whole- hearted and very affectionate, wanting to impart your happiness to the other person. You appear as happy, strong, and playful. Apparently you are very preoccupied with your dignity and how you appear to others. The voice of your unconscious tells you to apply yourself to more down-to-earth matters With your natural cleverness you should be able to achieve a harmonious relationship between these two categories, making you a fulfilled individual.    Ascendant in Virgo, Mercury in the Twelfth House    At the time of your birth the zodiacal sign of Virgo was ascending in the horizon. Its ruler Mercury is located in the twelfth house.   This indicates that throughout your life you will assume a reserved, quiet, analytical, critical, and receptive attitude.   Although you are not an individual with a very strong ambition, you possess the ability to persevere and exert ingenuity.   Some selfishness is noted. However, if you are able to counteract this trait with your natural helpful and sympathetic attitude and address your positive qualities to resolve the problems of others then you will accomplish your highest spiritual duties and your degree of consciousness and perception will be expanded.   You are not afraid to work but you like to do things where you can use intellectual resources rather than mechanical ones. There is some independence here but don't try to be forceful about it because Virgo's natural habitat is one in which the person is led by some powerful authority and where the important decisions are best made by others.   You are very attentive to detail and this makes you a good worker, especially so in those jobs that require a great deal of precision and observation. You have a desire for purity and though you don't mind relating to others there is something that you do dislike: continuous intrusion of your privacy. Business and practicality should be very important in your life. Although we are not advising you to turn against your natural traits, which make you slightly reserved, we would suggest that when in love you let yourself relax and respond so as to be able to return some of the affection you are receiving.   Life will find you in many situations in which you will function as advisor and counsellor; make use of these opportunities to project the power of your creativeness.   This position denotes a life that has you cast in rather obscure and inconspicuous roles. Your intellect is peculiarly subtle. Your life will be very much motivated by your love for risk and your various activities of a secret nature.   A tendency here is that in spite of your undoubted ability, opportunity may seldom knock at your door. You should try to jump at any chance and not wait for a second occurrence.   Try to emphasize your conscientiousness in all the things you do.    Saturn in the Fourth House    Saturn was found in the fourth house at the time of your birth. With this placement you may have the feeling that duties and obligations in your early childhood conflicted with your innermost emotional needs. Consequently, you felt frustrated and misunderstood. This could lead to a sense of fear and distrust in the world that is not conducive to success in human relations and communications.   However, this does not have to be the case. Although you may feel that your personal freedom is hindered, Saturn can lead you to a better understanding of what causes these emotions. You have the ability to learn a lot about your inner self and about what you need to find emotional security. If you accept Saturn's challenges, you will be able to do or leave things at your own volition. It is only your inner duties and obligations you have to answer to.   Note: Saturn is technically near the end of house 3 and is therefore interpreted in house 4.    Sun in the Twelfth House    The Sun was in your twelfth house at the time of birth. This may indicate a life full of limitations, obstacles, and human opposition, but at the same time a lot of inner strength and energy.   You are urged to pause and reflect upon your own accumulated history. Take some time for introspection. It may result in a purification process accompanied by some remorse of conscience.   Internally, you are quite different from the way you present yourself externally. You possess a vast reservoir of energy that may be partially hidden even from your own awareness.   Your internal disposition is strong, commanding, open, and of a rare generosity. More and more you should try to bring these characteristics into the open so that they can overcome some of the less desirable aspects of your personality.    Moon in the Twelfth House    The Moon was in your twelfth house at the time of birth. Secretly, you enjoy a love of romance and adventure that lends a bit of excitement to your daydreaming.   It is possible that the little popularity that you may enjoy in this life will be from some very reserved and secretive circles where your merits are recognized.   It can be expected that you will be successful in positions that call for solitude or remote locations.    Venus in the Twelfth House    Venus was in the twelfth house at the time of birth.   Only those very close to you have a hint of the little known facets of your personality. Regardless of the way you speak and express yourself, when you are alone, relaxed, and free of worry, you can have a sociable and congenial temperament that runs alongside a generous, kind, and attractive character.   This astrological combination may lead you into clandestine love affairs. Unless you use a great amount of tact and diplomacy, these secret affairs may create social complications that force premature termination.  From: www.astro.com

       Once more I was a wolf... I was running free, the cool wind blowing against my face. There was no worry, just the thrill of running coupled with the excitement of the hunt. The air tasted sweet tonight... I could almost smell prey. Suddenly the road stopped.    I woke up at that point. I have been having this dream for about 4 nights now. Recurring dreams have a meaning... What is it?   "Do you live for the kill, or the thrill of the hunt?"   Does anyone know or care what I want? Does anyone know what I fear?   I am a very overwhelming person by nature, and people who can't take it find me weird. Haha... I guess it really takes the patience of a saint to decipher and love me. Meanwhile, I still wait for her... the first one to love and decipher my mystery.   I don't know. Who cares what everyone else thinks of me... but at the same time, all I really want is for someone to understand me, to love me for what I am. Although I do have female friends to confide in... esp. 2 very nice ladies... but its different. There is always that barrier.   I always marvel at how beautiful these two ladies are... both unique in their characteristics, but at the same time, of comparable beauty in heart and body. Too bad I can't try to fall in love with them, the romantic way... it is just not the way. Unless...   I am not ready to go into any kind of relationship yet... not at such a time.    " You look at me and ask, well, "Why is he so sad?"   He won't tell you that he lost the only love he ever had.   He won't tell you that he loved her and her love was a lie.   He won't tell you how he waits with desperation in her eye.   He won't tell you that he had her and she threw his love away.   He won't tell you if you ask him, he has nothing left to say.   So don't look at me and ask why he's sitting all alone.   He's trying to forget her, live his life and just move on.   And what he cannot tell you if you ask him why he's sad.   Does he feels like he has lost the only love he ever had ."

      They say there is always a time for firsts. Oh well, perhaps it is good that I should start a blog, at least I won't feel obligated to fill up the blanks every other day, unlike when I have a diary... I somehow feel the urge to fill it up with words. Such is my love and addiction to writing.   More to come...

      Raising my sword I smite it down, rendering all asunder, but what is left for me to do, when the revenge, is all over?  What of the loneliness that eats so deep, that runs in the channels, in my veins, it eats so deep it makes a hole, a vacuum that calls, but with no reply.  Standing alone, I watch the times, floating along with the tides, with nothing else but alot of hope, drifting in my, own little boat.  All I can do is wait... and hope.

       "Underwear is for losers, real MEN don't wear anything beneath" --- Anon.   I have a little madness within me, just a little, not too much, you see, it swirls and swirls, as colours unfurl, colours like my feelings, in my tiny world.  Red, destroyer, lover, power, the passion that binds it altogether, It burns so much, it burns so bright, it ignites the power that lies inside.  Green, protector, silent deeds, sowing all it's seeds, seeds of strength, of love, of hate, seeds that grow, to decide my fate.   Darkness falls.   Cold, calculating, wraith of evil, in this darkness do i revel, kill, kill, kill, conquer, conquer, conquer, riding on the wings of destruction.  Yet in this darkness, I see light, I see hope and future so bright, force of nature brought to life, Behold, the coming of a salvation might.  24 hours not more not less, and it comes, this mid-year test, hold your horses, grab your arms, march on forward never look back, for victory is in sight, there will be no regret.  Hear this call ye unbelievers, my vow of my rebirth, I shall descend upon your nest of vile, and chop down thy pride, crushing spirits down and out.   Beware beware!    THE FABRIC OF A THOUSAND LEGACIES WOVEN INTO ONE.

      Today I went to school and expected to see my daisy plant all alive and well. However I was greeted by a plant that was dying. At that point, I had a sudden though about how two things can be so intricately linked that one cannot survive without the other. For all the skeptics out there, it has been a horrible past week. I was so sick, but so starved of good conversation that I would force myself to sit in front of the computer.  Why? People feel that I am foolish to do this instead of resting properly, but I beg to differ. To me, the feeding of my emotions is more important to feeding my body. Sometimes I forget to take care of my body so often that it breaks down, like all machines do. I feel so tired nowadays, so broken.  I slept not a wink last night. I spent it thinking of one question (or two, or maybe al whole lot of questions): Would I be heartless to start to pursue a new relationship at this time? Is it a knee-jerk reaction to what happened? Am I ready? Am I just seeking a life raft?  I really don't know. All I want now is to regain a lost faith, a lost faith in love. I see people around me, some nicely and subtlely, some outrageously, in love. I would like to declare that I am not at all jealous at their situation. It is just that I feel happy for them and all, and I wish them all the best, and I pray so hard that they would not befall the same fate as me, but I cannot seem to remember but I cannot seem to forget that wonderful the feeling of love. I can only bemoan the feeling of loss, the sorrow, and my tears are my friends in this indulgence.   I was especially affected when Deb said, "Are you ready so quickly for it?"   I felt stunned at that point. Was time really a factor in how quickly I was to be ready for a new experience? Was it too early for another gamble? Was it too early to place my heart on the line again? Am I being selfish if I do so? I remember a few days back when I was with a female friend and she told me of how Shi Ying was ridiculed by some guys because she was out holding hands with Daniel.   In that instant, I felt really mad. I mean, I had a rush to beat all those guys who defiled her name.   Every evening I am reminded of a vow I made to her, that I will never leave her for the worse. What is the worse then? In my opinion, Daniel could be the worse thing that is happening to her now? However, am I in any position to stop what is happening? I can only suffer in silence, and resign myself to a fate that I have placed my self in. I chose the endless self-torment. I chose this self-mutilation. I chose this self-punishment. I don't want to blame her for what has happened. It feels so unfair toward me, but every moment, I think of my vow, I think of my feelings, I think that I would be better off dead.   Gone.   How many people would notice? How many people would shed a tear and remember the boy who would be there the moment you asked, as long as he called you friend? When I am alive and breathing, how many people actually care what is happening to me, or what problems I am facing inside, and can they even comprehend that pain? People skip the vital sentences that would speak the volumes that my heart preaches. They never read the signs of a failing strength. Always, I am left alone to solve my problems. I must pick myself up from the darkness. I must Hunt alone.   They take me for granted.   All I want to be is to be loved. I would give up everything, anything, in order to know once and for all that someone would be there for me. Someone whom I can share my Darkest moments, yet partake in the Celebration of Life. No. People get frightened when I get all serious. They are not acuustomed to the serious side of me. The Darker side of my nature. They think that I would smile, smile and smile and even more, just because it was me, and nothing would take me down.   I can only smile so much before I cry. I admit my humanity.   Am I such a cold, undeserving, arrogant and selfish bastard? Maybe I am... maybe that is all I am. Maybe that is all people make me out to be. Maybe that is all people want me to be. Maybe... I should not even hope for love. Love has denied me. I can never love again because I was a fool, and I will be punished for my sins of arrogance, I will be punished for my own superficiality. I will be punished because I am a vortex of emotion. I will be punished because I walk the grey area between darkness and light.  No one will ever love me. For the simple reason that no one can comprehend me. I am just the guy that no one can ever decipher, no one can ever understand, no one can feel my heart and say, "Shi Yuan, I do care for you, alot. You will never be alone." I have no looks, no character, no skills. I am Un-Loved.  I must fight this solo war. Alone. In the meantime, my tears stain my sword of past, present and future regrets. Of lost. Of pain. Of the reality that love may just be a facade. I am breaking apart. I feel so alone.  <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>  "How are you" "Take care" "Good night" "Good morning" "Wishing you the best"  Words that express, in so little, infinite care, to warm the heart so brittle, concern for how I fare.  No it must not, for I am Un-Loved, for in my boxes, I look and see, emptiness is all that greets me.  I just want to love, I just want to care, but how can I, to what end of Purpose do I serve, when my heart is bare?  Can I give where there is none, Can I hope when it is dark? No. I. Cannot.  <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>   To love the imperfect person perfectly. To Cherish, Care, Understand. All I want is to be reminded of my value to someone, through simple words, because I matter, because I hold a place in her heart. In return, I want to show her my world, to just experience.   Experience. Care.   No. I must not have illusions, because it will never be meant to be.

      A blinding flash of light. Then silence.  I see someone. Her. She lies so quietly on this stone bed. I walk over slowly, afraid to see what my mind believes. No. It cannot be.  It must. For I had wished it.   "No."   She has to go. You have to move on. Therefore she must die.   "Say what you need to her now. She will be buried soon."    A Final Tribute to The Lady Of My Heart.    <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>   You lay so still, white as death, but pure as ever, as angel's breath.  I reach to touch, those cheeks so cold, where once warm blood flowed, channels now empty, silence is gold.  Those lips I sorely, wanted to kiss, now lie closed, passion has now, ceased.  Sweet queen of my heart, I question thee, why has it got to come to this? Pain, torture, is it worth all that you have risked?  Now you lay dead, So quiet so cold, your Smile has been taken, by the Robber of Old, Death.  The sun has vanished, my world is now Dark, but I swore to bury you, and now it must pass, this Sorrow begone.  This purity stained, by the D's hands, cannot be returned, lest you repent.   <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>   A knight must be defined, by his Deeds...  A knight is sworn to valour His  heart  knows only  virtures  His  blade  defends the  helpless  His  might  upholds the  weak  His  words  speaks the  truth  His  wrath  undoes the  wicked   Thus I shall not fail.  I remember feeling numb, oblivious to everything. I just felt pain inside, the eating vacuum that threatens to consume everything I stood for. My feelings, my thoughts did not matter anymore.  Now. Everything is different. Just as the Lady has taken off with her new love, I must move on. There are responsibilities. People whom I love and care for enough to cause me to shift my entire heart and soul to looking after their well-being. My suffering must really end. It should end. The time has come for me to be heartless. I have mourned long enough.   It has come. The stars have shown me the way.   May my faith carry me through as today I break all bonds of lost love. I remember those words...  "When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume the Powers of the Earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impels them to the separation.  We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness..."  Lady, I hereby break all bonds and abolish thee. Go now. Today, I embrace a New Future without you. Today I cast you away and embrace new Loves. Today I Hunt, and I am not the Hunted. Onward!

      Today I make a Choice. The Choice to change my life. The Choice turn directions. I choose to not be affected by any rainy days anymore. Never again will I shed another tear for her.  1) I choose to forget.  2) I choose to forgive.  3) I choose to let go.  4) I choose to save my own soul.  5) I choose to turn away.  6) I choose to bury you.  7) I choose to erase all that is of you from my mind.  8) I choose to close this chapter.  9) I choose to see the light.  10) I choose to be cruel.  I hope you never rise in my mind again. I hope I will never think of you again. I hope that one day when I see you in dire straits ( not cursing you, but stating a fact, because everyone has a low period ), I will have enough willpower not to embrace you all over again.  Thus, I call upon the powers of the generations of hunters before me to grant me the strength to open my fist, and let her go. Tomorrow shall mark a new beginning, a tomorrow without you. A tomorrow of hope. A tomorrow of strength.  May my ancestors watch over me. I pity the innocence lost, but that will be no excuse for me to think about you ever again. I admit I have had hope before, I admit that I believed that you had the willpower to no sink lower.   Unfortunately I hoped wrong.   Begone! Thou is not welcome here. I cast thee and thy memories into the Nothingness. I deny and abjure thee. Begone!  <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>  I pray this solemn prayer, in the darkest of hours, that I may find Peace, Serenity, Strength.  I pray this solemn prayer, for the salvation of my mind to Forget, Forgive, Hope.  Storms may roar, warriors may fall, but I shall stand above tall, To smite with my might all that defies, Hearken my enemies, to my warcries.   Teiwaz.   <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>

      "It ends. Tonight."  Slicing her wrists open, I hang her by them on the nearest tree. Another two more incisions on the leg, carefully made by my blade, and my work is done.  "Do you penance, and bleed."  She whimpers as she feels her life drain from her, and I smile. I have not felt so alive in ages. It has been a long time.  "Scream! Have I not given you enough pain? Why do you not scream! Scream damn it!"  The sky turns dark overhead as I hear the rumble of thunder. She screams pitifully. The rain falls, and I reach out to taste the the sweet rain that shall fall. It comes down slowly, drizzling at first, but gradually building itself up into a full shower. I close my eyes to welcome the rain, and open my mouth as if I would swallow the sky itself.  The coppery taste of blood. A rain of blood. How appropriate.  I begin to laugh. I laugh so hard that it brings me to my knees. I laugh so much that tears come to my eyes. So much blood, so much life.   For the blood brings us life.   Letting go of my blade, I grab my head. I start to wail. All of a sudden my sorrow fills me, chokes me, and reminds me of my humanity. I cry. I resent that sorrow. I try to fight it, I try so hard, but the merciless sorrow never relents. It torments me, and it will not rest till I am dead.  "No!"   I must remember that I am all alone now. Forsaken.   Overhead, the rain falls, and the thunder rumbles, as if to remind me of my loneliness.   Beneath all, a broken man kneels as if in punishment. His wailing fills the air.  I wake up.  Then I begin to cry.

       8/6/2004 Tuesday  10.53pm   I had nothing to add in the morning so I left the entry blank until now. I feel exhausted today, mostly due to my exertions with my mugging at night. I have had only 7 hours of sleep in the past 2 days, and the fact that I have the strength to write this entry and think logically would make this entry a rather miraculous one.  Today was another day of talks and presentations. I was bored to tears because the speakers were mostly not trying at all. It felt like they were there because they were obliged to, not because they wanted to. They mumbled alot and very often they would rattle off into a tiny world of their own, and end it with "do you get what I am saying?" NO. Obviously not. I was fairly surprised that anyone managed to field any questions because most of the discussion was totally incoherent to me.  Couple that scenerio with a poor microphone system, a broken down air-con, a blazer and a outrageously thick Seminar file, and you have the ultimate recipe for a sleepy morning and afternoon. It just went by so quickly because I was in Dreamland half the time.  I am picking up more Malay phrases now, and I hope to use them in the future. In the meantime, I am also teaching Chinese to one non-Chinese group member. It felt really good to exchange pointers because it stirred my mental capabilities and gave me a sense of satisfaction. At least I am learning something out of all this. The person I am teaching Sanjna, is one year older than me. I am so proud of her! She has picked up the language so fast, and it amazes me to be able to converse with her simply in Chinese. Aini! It seems like you need to put more steam into learning! Chinese is really possible, even if you are non-Chinese.  It is the prospect of breaking this kind of language and cultural barriers that has made this Seminar a fruitful one. When the food is not good, the sleeping quarters are in a sorry state ( The blinds are damn noisy ), and all the inscessant talks that send sleep straight into my mind, the people who are in this situation with you are truly the only comfort I can get. The fan keeps blowing the blinds against the walls and it makes so much noise! What can I do... It is so hot! I am having difficulty thinking and sleeping even.  Mugging did not go well at all last night. I barely managed a chapter before going to bed. I hope to do better today. I met Mr Choy who gave me all the essays, and I have found out that Qadir has piped me this round. Congratulations! I will me meeting everyone soon to try and return all the papers.  Today I continue to see idiotic behaviour from some of my peers. Fortunately they don't belong to my group. Thank heavens for that.  Penny from HCJC had an attack of stomach ache. She is another RGS girl... but nevermind that. Apparently the stomach ache also triggered a hyperventilation. I heard she has been taken home... I hope and pray that she gets well soon. ( Author's note: The stomach ache mentioned was found out to be a gastric attack because Penny forgot to eat before she went to train. I have heard Penny is fine now, and I would very much like to say take care and don't strain yourself too much next time. Good luck for the meets. )  Life is so precious. Please do take care, if not for your sake, just do it for anyone's and anything's sake. I treasure every friend like my own life and I don't want to have anything happen to them. I love all of you very much.  Tonight was extremely fun, because we laughed so much as we played games after dinner. Thanks to my group for all the exciting, quirky and cheeky moments. They will always be etched in my memory. I smile even now. The VJ presentation went extremely well, and we managed a VJ cheer. Great job presenters! I felt rather embaressed at one point because I stood up to dance while everyone else just stoned. It was extremely stinky because there were councillors among those sitting down, and we were encouraged by the teachers to do so. What the hell. Lousy attitudes.  I guess thats all for tonight. I look forward to Friday.   So tired.    9/6/2004 Wednesday    10.46am   Today I woke up late for the activities. I actually managed 2 hours more before anyone came around to wake me. It feels great to have enough sleep. I am all energized and ready to face the world! Yesterday was another bad mugging experience, because I managed to cover very little. I feel rested today and I hope to do more today.  We had games this morning. It was rather irritating to have some people hog all the games. Some people just don't know team spirit and sharing. I just played for like 30 seconds or so beofre I was called off, only to have a "game hogger" take my place. Was it good fun? No. I hate playing alongside such people.   Stop it.    9.09pm   The Christian fervour within this seminar has reached new heights with a worship session going on RIGHT NOW. They make one cacophonic bunch. I would take Ming Hui singing in the bathroom anyday compared to them. I don't mean anything about Christians really, but if they carry it abit too far through such public display, I think it is a little overboard, since some people do need their rest.  Today's workshop was rather boring. The arts performance was in the form of belly-dancingm which in my opinion not very fantastic. I really wish for someone to talk now, because all this confinement and silence is killing me. I am being stifled to death in this place where there is nothing to look forward to except study and talks. The only thing I am sure is that I will be very glad on Friday.   Thank heavens for monetary constraints.   I literally pray to get home as soon as possible. There are so many constraints, no piano, no computer and worst of all, no person to talk to except through the phone. What is up with everyone? I am sick of taking the back seat. I finally feel the pain of loneliness and boredom. I feel like crying now, especially when it feels like the world has forgotten me. I feel so tired of all these incessant activity, hypocrisy, and finally all this horrible sense of humours around me.  Everyone here is wearing a mask. It seems like everyone tries so hard to integrate, socialise with the group members, but to what end is this? At the end of th day, we will return back to our own worlds and colleges. The faces here will eventually become a thing of the past. THese artificial faces. I am stuck in this man-made jungle, and the people I know could very well be beasts... maybe not all.  My brain is so starved of communication! My mouth is still, and my fingers are restrained for the lack of a piano. I think I want to just sleep my way out of this seminar. I just want to cry out loud.   It rained in the afternoon.   I am reminded of the loneliness that exists in my heart. She made such a vacuum that I cannot help but feel shed tears silently as the skies shed theirs. My heart feels so broken, and strong as I may seem, my spirit is still devastated from the blow she dealt to my love.   All the giving and sacrifices; she would be cruel.   If truth were to be told, I have yet let go of her. She haunts my every breath, every living moment, every note I play, every poem I write. My crying must go unheard, for this is my fate that I placed myself in. I have other responsibilities, and I must not fall just because of one. Still the pain...  The woman in my life will be special. I promise.   It rained this afternoon... like the way... my tears flow.    10/6/2004 Thursday  6.29am    Love is not love till it is given away.   To live for emotion is extremely painful. Nevertheless, it is the emotional experience that binds. It is love that prevents the world from freezing over. The truth is, though I may seem cold, calculating, and egoistic at times, all I crave is for a constant passion that love and romance brings. I want to share my world with someone else. My experiences, my thoughts, my everything.  I hunger so much that I begin to tire of this hungering.  Sometimes I question my belief of giving, especially when I feel people start taking me for granted. The world changes so much, and no one can ever expect when one might just leave the world. Therefore I make it a point to live life to it's fullest and celebrate it's purpose and sanctity. I try to give as much as I can, because I believe that if something is not given away, the value is not realised.   I still wish... If I died tomorrow, would anyone shed a tear for me?   Maybe. I hope so. At least, I hope that I have made a positive difference to your life. Thank you for being in mine, and I appreciate everyone, no matter how small the deed, because I value the friendship that exists. The bond. This friendship will last till my last breath, and I will honour all my friends, from the heart. Take care everyone.   5.24pm   I have just returned from Sentosa. I am packing to ready myself up for leaving tomorrow. Finally.  We came in as overall 3rd group! It has been wonderful work on the part of the group. It was fun and sweaty in Sentosa as we went around the island. It was both physically and mentally tiring. However, it was fulfilling as we co-operated and emerged as one of the top groups.  $5 dollar voucher to Popular. $20 dollars to Kinokuniya. I am rich again!  I learnt a new skill that will shock everyone. Just wait and see! I feel so proud of myself. However. I must really get down to some serious study tonight. I need to score really well this round to prove all the critics wrong. I am no pushover because I will pratice what I preach. Tread carefully with your words. Reuben was nice enough to wish me luck today. I guess with that 1000 SMS, you can do lots of stuff. Thanks Reuben, really appreciate it. See people? I got nice seniors.   Author's note: The Pre-U Seminar adventure log shall end here. The rest is irrelevant. Thanks for supporting me, and best wishes for exams. SMILE! :)

       The following will be a blow by blow account as experienced by me in Pre-U Seminar. Conflicting messages may occur, however, I choose not to edit any of them because I want to present a picture of how emotions, thoughts, and paradigms may shift within hours or days. Thanks for looking in, and have fun reading. I just want to capture th moment...    Sunday 6/6/2004  3.52pm   Just arrived in my toom and I have unpacked everything as I see fit. I feel a sudden onslaught of freedom, and it is just so overwhleming, because it is so sudden! This is the moment, as I experience a freedom being outside of home. I have meet a few people today, Daniel (the SLO), Jeremy, Karen, Adeline and Rachel. I hope to get to know them better in the next few days.  As expected the room is rather small and "cooped up" is written on it's four walls. Nevertheless, it is acceptable. At least the lights and fans are working. I had some trouble opening the door though. A genius like me who can't get through a door... how wonderful. I guess I am becoming obselete to all these new electronic locks.  Mun Bbun is moody today. I guess he is just very tired. I hope he recovers soon!  It is a nice quaint little room of my own! I feel so proud of it! I cannot help but feel so proud about it, and I am smiling very widely right now. Look out NUS!  At the same time, I must really get down to my studies. I have to start today, or elseit might be too late. Go for it!   If someone has to do it, why not me?    4.10pm   I have just arranged a mugging schedule. I really hope to cover all the bases. I am just raring to mug like crazy in here, and no one will stop me, unless of course I doze off while mugging. I pray that I don't.  I have found out to my dismay that there are no bins in the room! The nearest one seems to be in the toilet. I guess it is all part of the package that comes with priacy. I am thinking of Fairuz, Deb and maybe, please emphasise maybe Ming. Just kidding. I am beginning to miss my brother too. I must go now though. Everyone has to meet at the hall at 4.30pm and it will be a long walk there. I will write when I return.   11.17pm   It is rather late and I would be wise to get down to study. It has been a rather fun and onteresting day. There is a certain Daniel Leung ( There are 2 Daniels around, wonder why this name is so popular ) who is very talented with singing.Unfortunately in my opinion he a be a tad bit too religious. He is a nice Christian boy no doubt,but I feel that it would be unwise to always wait for God, always place one's fate in his hands... We must realise that God cannot be always there, God has better things todo after all. We therefore must be there for ourselves, because after God can't just keep on looking and forget about Creation.   Believe in the power of self.   I have roughly known the whole group. The names mostly. I have not sighted anyone real deep yet, but I think Sufyan might just be one of them. Teck Soon has a mind of his own, while Jeremy, lets just say Jeremy is a quieter Sherman. They are both Christian boys that are very proud of that fact. I feel that being proud of one's religion is not a bad idea, but rather, don't be too obvious about it. After all, other people do have different faiths and it would do well to respect that.  We won the scavenger hunt today. I hope we continue this winning streak. I am beginning to enjoy this seminar. I hope to get a chance to meet the Education Ministers, so I can get the email interview I need. We shall wait and see then.  I have not seen Mr. Choy the whole day. Wonder whats up with the GP essays?  I am missing my piano now. ALl that singing by the Christian bunch just now has not helped on bit, because no one else could sing it except them. It is like ostracizing the rest of us. Do they think they are superior or are they just plain insensitive? As a side note, I noticed how girls like to clump together as a bunch. Is it about a sense of security? All the useless exchange of phone numbers. At the end of the day, would we use these numbers after the camp? A waste of handphone memory in my opinion. Everyone here tries really hard to be sociable, to attempt to become part of the bigger group. Weak. I believe we must learn to stand alone, lest one day we fall when there is no one around to back us up.  This is in no way saying that I don't appreciate my friends. I enjoy their company, but in the end, the fact is that I might one day have to stand on my own against the unknown, either to protect myself or a loved one. I cannot afford to be weak. My responsibilities prevent me from being so.  I have alot of mugging to do tonight. My anti-social behaviour says everything. My group is not worth my time, yet. Perhaps when I get to know everyone better. Maybe then. Who knoes? I still hope to get to know them at a deeper level. I must trust them before I can give to them right?   What a great show I am seeing. Pretense. Disgusting.    Thursday 7/6/2004  5.10am   I begin so early today because my sleep was deprived from me last night. I am feeling a slight restlessness, and exhaustion, but I think, and hope thaht breakfast will be able to cure all of that. Last night's revision went well, and I hope to continue tonight, I really hope today will be as good as yetrday, if not better. My tired soul may just fail me today.  My quest for the mid-years continue. Wish me luck!   6.17am   I am now wearing my school uniform.My tie seems abnormally long but I don't mid, after all the blazer will cover it up. I am quite pleased with the schedule today because it will be alot of listening and minimal thinking. I really hope to meet one of the ministers for PW's sake. At the same time, I wonder about my SRS project. I hope Deb has been doing her bit, because I have not heard anything from Chee. That is rather undependable behavious I believe. It seems he may lack a certain level of initiative.  How do I manage so many projects at one go with the mid-years coming? I guess it must be one at a time. I think my group members need more drive. I cannot always be there pushing and pushing. It worries me. I worry about this and that, to the point of paranoia. I don't want to rush everything at the last minute. The product will definitely stink in this case. Trust me. In a team we really cannot afford to be so selfish. Everyone must realise that we have to also have the drive for the project because it is everyone's responsibility and not just one person who must chase and chase the others to get things done. I am so sick all of that.  I hope Deb has more drive and reliability. Please don't disappoint me.   8.58pm   I am writing this at the Fuzion, it is a very nice shop with great seats and lighting. Air-conditioning is such a luxury within the camp. The smoothies are really good.  I am tired physically. I cannot help but wonder how quickly or rather how slowly the day went by. It was an alright day, neither exciting nor increadibly boring. It was also not fulfilling either. I would label today a wasted day if I had not collect a bottle of Medical Faculty water.   I felt that Ministers should really learn to speak up. He was mumbling alot throughout and some parts were barely audible. His speech was horribly politically correct and it was terribly uninteresting. MY interest was piqued though when the RJC contingent seemed particularly interested and enthusiastic during the Q and A session. I cannot help but remember what Mr Ho said about us and RJC.  I wonder...  The 2 parallel presentations were fine. The second one seemed more boring though as compared to the first. I could not help but begin to doze off. The first one was was really energetic and interesting though, because it had a very strong element of youth within.  It was also today that I witnessed the immaturity of my peers. The RJC contingent was bombed utterly with very trivial question. The reason behind is that they are from RJC and they had a speaker with an attitude problem and a face that you would love to smack really hard. I cannot help but despise all this people who can forgo all their sense of pride and self just to whack the RJC contingent. It is soo foolish and unbecoming of their age.    By the way, Felicia sends her regards to Fruz. Sufyan sends his regards to Salman.     9.23pm   I am using this short intercal to try and jot down more views about a certain person.  He was sitting beside me during the 2nd parallel presentation. Damn was he a noisy dickhead. He stinks positively in all directions. Firstly he was going on and on about the RIGHT answer, and the PERFECT answer. Next he would go into a frenzy to express his negative feelings toward the RJC contingent. He really needs to grow up.  I miss people to speak my mind to. It has been a struggle keeping all my emotions in check. I was glad for the chance to call home, Deb and Huiwen. I felt rather left out when I called Deb, she did not even ask me how I was!   Oh well, people do forget.   I wonder whether I have made the right choice coming here. The environment is no doubt condusive for study because I can't find anything else to do at night. Adventures must be thrown out of the window if I want to get anything done. The mid-years beckon and I will do anything within my power to do well for them.  10.50pm  I would begin the entry with a question of Perfection. Perfection can never be objective because it is inherent that one size can never fil all. Perfection must therefore become objective. There is no such thing as a right answer, because if we think about it, there are always many solutions to a single problem. The task upon us is to seek the solution that best suits us.   Can anyone really say 1 + 1 is not equal 11?   Therefore we cannot judge a person right or wrong just from his words, actions or character. Everyone may be right, but at the same time, there is also the slightest possibility of being wrong. The general consensus may not be right, but in a society where the system is democracy and the majority speak, we can do little but hope some persons wake up from this nightmareof searching for the perfect answer, simply because there is no such thing.  One more thing. Never ever express emotion in a dangerous situation. Emotion makes one person weak, and it is that instant of weakness that you hand me weapons to your heart and I will not hesitate to use it if I am threatened. Don't fear me though my friends, and you know who you are, I will never raise my hand against any of you. Enemies beware. Be really really afraid. This is not a warning. This is a truth.  People who indulge in emotion will die a most painful death because it will be death by emotional means. It will be their inevitable fate. I will be doing alot of mudding tonight. Till then, au revoir and take care.   Author's note: I am feeling very exhausted and I will need some time before I actually can get coherent thoughts. Therefore my blog entries in the next 2 days will consist of my adventures and experiences in the Pre-U seminar. I will begin updating present dated blogs once I recover. Thanks for being a part of this blog. Your reading makes it all worth it. All S11 people, I have your essays. Please contact me to collect them.

      Being a male can be dangerous. Literally. You might have all the muscles in the world, all the intelligence, but as long as a girl gives you a good kick, you will suffer. Don't believe me? Ask your nearest female to take aim.  It is hard being a man nowadays, especially when there is the stereotype alpha male image that you have to live up to. In the past men were expected to:  1) Be physically strong, so they can hunt food and protect their families. 2) Be healthy 3) Be intelligent 4) Be powerful 5) Be rich ( ATM anyone?)  These were the traits that were expected of men in the past. In short they were to the the economic driving force within the family. However, in the past this was possible because the women of the past devoted themselves to building a home, to creating a warm family that the man can return home to. I don't know what other men think, but I feel that home is truly where the heart is. I will allow my wife to go out and work, as long as she cooks up a storm at home. Home-cooked meals play such a significant role in my life, they allow me to feel the warmth of home, to sit down together at the dining table makes me feel truly at home and at ease.  The modern man of today is oppressed. In addition to becoming the economic force within the modern home, he is now also expected to fill in the roles of below:  1) Be the nanny 2) Be a home-maker 3) Be the house cleaner 4) Be the butler of your wife  He is now at the beck and call of his wife. Is this how a woman should function? Like a Queen whereby her only formal duty is to bear children and let it rest at that? The new generation of ladies:  1) Cannot cook 2) Know minimal houseworking skills 3) Have to rely on a certain 'Maria'  Think about it men out there. Are we dying for women? Yes. Are we living for women? Yes. However if we were to look at it economically, as we are more prone to do so, the modern exchange stinks!  What has happened to the modern lady of today? It is so disappointing!  Stop. Before everyone accuses me of being a chauvinist, let me make this clear. There be A FEW GOOD WOMEN out there! All hope is not lost. In the meantime, I would like to proclaim that we men shall not stoop down any longer. He shall not go down on his knees. He shall not overstep his economic boundaries anymore. He shall not satisfy the nonsensical whims and wants of the modern women, especially when she decides to lose all her responsibilities as the caring wife and mother.  I would also like to tell men with good ladies beside them now, cherish them and love them with all your heart. They are such a rarity, and they do deserved to be taken care of like true diamonds. Don't mistreat them, or else... (I will get you.)   Love has a price to pay. Marriage is about defining roles, and getting work done together till the end of days.

       Warning: The next few lines are going to be pure hormonal. If you are offended by testosterone. Please skip until the next bold lettering.   I woke up today feeling on top of the world. It was such a wonderful feeling. I guess it was from watching "Miss Universe" last night, because it gave me hope that there are really very beautiful women out there with not alot of brains.  That does not apply to Miss USA though! WoOhOo! She is like WOW! She has that smile that melts my heart, and she is SO SMART! She is doing a doctorate in child psychology! OH MY GOD! I love her already! This is what epitomes the perfect woman... A super beautiful physique and look that looks like it came from an artist's painting, combined with the intellect of a scientist.  AAAHHH! If looks could kill, Miss Australia, now the Miss Universe, has killed me. She has that aura around her that says "I will eat you if you come closer". How can I not come closer? She is such a magnet... unfortunately she is not very smart, so oh well.  Miss Norway is sooooo cute! Miss Paraguay is sooooo sexy! Need I say more? I feel that us men should watch Miss Universe more often. Then start praying that the girls around us start becoming like them. Seriously, I feel that looks don't matter much, but it is the way they carry themselves. It is that subtle smile, that image projection that determines how a girl looks, not how she naturally is.   Sophistication. Class.   Psst... Don't be disheartened girls! I still love you all the same, because in my mind... all of you are as beautiful, and are as sophisticated my Miss Universe! (Deb, Joy = sophistication? Questionable. Maybe one day, but not now. Fruz, ET, Huiwen, you will pass this zone.)   OH MY! BEAUTIFUL LADIES RULE MY HEART!    Here we see Mr. Bladesinger revert back from wolf form to human form. No more drooling. Serious. Can't believe me? Read on.   Enough of all that. We will now dwell on topics less sexual I guess. Today was a wonderful day, because I went out on a date! This is my first in 2 months, and I felt really good to be of service to a lady friend. I am still smiling now, because I had such an enjoyable time, with such a beautiful lady. Thank you for the outing, and thanks for the memories.   I bought 3 piano books today, which means I will be able to play even more songs in the coming semester! I love music, and I could not help myself from looking and looking at all the music books there! Astrology and music books are probably the only books I ever touch, and perhaps the occasional fantasy fiction, or self-help books.   At this point, Mr. Bladesinger suddenly bursts into laughter, and reverts back to crazy mode.   WOOHOO! Can't really write anything serious today because I am feeling so happy! I love all of you! Kiss me!  I have just learnt how to play 'Yesterday'! WOOHOO! I am such a prodigy, such a genius, such a pro! Don't anyone dare make any snide remarks at this point. I am warning you. Snide remarks that hurt my ego will be taken hard no matter how lightly meant. Don't ever do it. Especially when I am ecstatic now.  MONEY! POWER! MINE MINE MINE!  People I like:  People who have intellect. People who have power and know how to manage it. People who have sohpistcation. People who appreciate the simple things in life. People whose idea of a perfect date is a romantic stroll in the park of beach, occasionally a meal at some posh restaurant. People who love nature. People who are full of energy.  People I avoid:  Stinkers. People who cheat. People who backstab. People who waste money. People who talk alot of cock but do nothing. People who are weak. People who don't dare to seek their dreams. People who don't dare to imagine. People who cannot dream. People who basically stink stink stink stink stink stink. Don't ever speak to me again if I say you stink. I will hurt you. I promise.  At the same time, I love everyone else as long as they don't stink.   Thank you for listening in to "Ravings of a mad Demonhunter". We hope you have a nice day.

      Today is Vesak Day, and being part of a Buddhist/Taoist family, I had to make a trip to the temple today. The place was crowded, overspilling onto the roads sometimes. Seriously all this fanatical action upon one dead wise man. I seriously doubt that Buddha would have appreciated being smoked with incense when he was alive, or bathed by thousands of people. Would his skin not have been soaked away by so much water?  I have rather radical beliefs about religion, because I believe that the present stage of religious fervour in the world is almost driving upon madness.   The Case for God...   Who can deny the existence of God? No one. Who can prove the existence of God? No one. Don't come and give me all that nonsense about religious happenings, miracle healing, holy books and customs and all the jazz. These were all created by men, for men. For me, I neither deny nor believe in the presence of God. However, I do believe that a higher being existence does exist, and it exists in all of us.  The thing about God, is that He/She (don't want to be sexist here, so I will use it in the future) is perfection incarnate. We should look upon God as a goal, something we work towards to, instead of blindly worshipping, praying and hoping that our wishes will get granted. The Laws of Physics will deny the existence of God. I believe in such a higher being though, because it exists in all of us, the difficulty is actually bringing this being into existence and shedding aside all the mundaneness to makes us mortal.  Rather than spending time in endless prayer, giving money to prove our devotion, and all those very silly things that we do with no fruitful return, we should give all these time and money into making a POSITIVE difference to other people's lives. Isn't that the Love that God preaches, to love your fellow man?  Now some people will come over and say all those praying feeds the soul. I don't deny that praying is a way to give your mind time for contemplation and let it immerse itself in simple thoughts. I mean, how much mental power does praying and wishing take? I would take praying as a relaxing activity, but to actually start to believe in the power of all prayer and no deed is ridiculous! Imagine hour upon hour kneeling, or sitting in one spot without doing anything useful to others. Your life has become centred around yourself! Think of the people who need you out there, why spend all these hours praying to God, but not following his teachings of Love?  This foolishness must stop.  I have never believed in donating money to temples that I have gone unless they do have a beneficiary. The act of gathering funds and build more exquisite temples is utter blasphemy. The same applies to churches and mosques and all the places of worship. If God knew you were spending such good money on building a nicer house for him, instead of using that money to save the millions around the world who urgently require food and medicine, what would God say?  Look at Africa, and think about how hungry and needy those people are before you build a better house for God. God being selfless, God being the being of ultimate grace would surely wish for the welfare of the needy than wish for a better house for himself. Stop finding excuses for such blind devotion because it tires people who require the funds and it irks me to see such good money being wasted on construction and creating more pollution.   Blind devotion is scary, the worse comes when you see this devotion became a rage. Murder. Does God condone you chopping up your fellow man when technically all of us are brothers in God's eyes?   What is the world coming too? Instead of realizing that God is a goal, we have turned into worshippers who place all our wishes upon him and do nothing to get them fulfilled. We have become parasites, always dependent on his divine intervention. We have become fools who believe that the devout will always end up in heaven. I call these people fools. I call these people weak. I call this people low, for they cannot stand on their own two feet and go forth to do God's work of creating happiness in other people's lives.  I was doing my bit of praying today at the temple, mind you I prayed for less than 10 seconds because I did not have much to wish for, and I didn't want to pester God anyway. I looked around the temple, and saw people with their eyes screwed up in concentration, mouth chanting away, and shaking those cans with the lot sticks in them.   I wanted to laugh at that foolishness.   Do they really believe by not pushing to get things in motion that they will ever get things accomplished? Naive losers.  Don't be dumb and blind as those people. Look within yourself, and you may just discover God inside you, just as you discover your imperfections and work towards improving yourself. Don't delude yourself in prayer, and don't waste your resources on building better buildings. Grandeur is nothing in God's eyes. After all, God has Heaven already, does he need a better home?   Go forth. Do God's work of creating a better world, instead of spending hours on end praying and praying. A great deal of work your chanting will do, like it will make the life of someone else better when they are starving without food. Do something for real, and do it in God's name. Perhaps God will appreciate that you have been listening.   What are you waiting for? Do your CIP today.

       We have suffered under the oppressive and imperialistic rule of the Tay Tiam Hock too long. Our resistance effects now culminate in the epitomy of our rage, and therefore UFAT, the United Front Against Tay has been set up to organise all anti-Tay activity. We are a frontline oragnisation dedicated to the elimination of one sole target and public enemy number one of 04S11: The dreaded Tay Tiam Hock.   We cannot allow this Tyrant any further right to our Happiness, to willingly and willfully injure our Pirde and Honour. We must rise. We must overthrow Power such as his. We may be small in number, but our Willis combined, we pray to set up a new and powerful dynasty that future S11 individuals will be proud of.   Hearken Tay. The end is near...   So it must be. So shall it be.     ><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>    Save me from this anger,  this vessel of rage,  the wrath force that shall destroy,  all shall fade.   All must fade.     ><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>    I feel sad. Happy but sad. Like something is missing. I appreciate all the care and concern that I am receiving, but it seems like something is lacking. A hole.     &nbsp;   People think I always have delusions of grandeur when I describe what I see to them. How powerful are dreams? Are they really that immaterial? Is it wrong to be unsatisfied with what you have and ask for more? I really cannot understand why people give me that look that says "yea right" when I describe my dreams to them.   I tell it to them in trust. I tell it to them in faith. I tell it to them not to prove my superiority over them, but rather to share a special secret between us. I tell it all because I want to include you in my future. I want to continue to hear your voice, to enjoy the subtle fragrance of your bath that permeates my senses. I want to feel you, see you, hear you... I don't ever want to lose you.   Can't you see? Its all about you. Even though I joke about my superiority, and whine over seemingly mundane matters, the truth is that I have never wanted anything, anyone else but you. I want you to be the first to know, to be the first to share in my joy. Disbelivable. But true. I swear with all my heart taht I have never wanted to injure your ego or your pride.     All I want... is to share.     My moments of triumph. My moments of darkness. My moments of vulnerability. My moments that define me. My moments on the piano. My moments when I have shed all cover and sat down to speak to you. The moments I try to help you see into me, but your failure to comprehend distresses me, and leads me away...   Do I live a mask? Yes. Music is the expression, the only expression of my soul. The words I type. The words I write. I can always lie with my mouth... but my hands... are weak. They tell naught but the truth, Wholesome, pure, disarming truth.     I have handed you a weapon to destroy me. I trust you not to use it.     I love the way your eyes speak volumes of your heart to me. I love the way you eyes twinkle when you smile. I love the way you move. I love the way you talk without opening your mouth. I love the way I cannot hide anything from you. I love the way you eat. I love the way you live. Most of all, I love you because you are you, and you are the first person I want to meet when I wake up, and the last person I want to kiss good night&nbsp;before I go to bed.   Its tough to say heal, when the healing salve is no where in sight. What else can I do when romance is deprived of me? I am cold, I am ruthless, I can snide you down down to size and crush your spirit like an insufferable bug.     It is tough to see that warm heart... but it is there... really.       "For you I would fight... At least I would try..."

       To say that I have forgotten about you is a lie. A blatant lie. I look myself in the mirror, and I see a young man who has been dealt a cruel hand by Fate. I see a young man who has lost direction. I see... myself.  "Why are you feeling sad, Shi Yuan?"  "Why are you lonley, Shi Yuan?"  "Cheer up lah, Shi Yuan?"  I have been an asshole the past few days. Tormenting people with snide remarks. Breaking people's pride. Destroying their dignity. I admit to it all.  I am Guilty.  I wish I could speak the volumes of my heart out. I really wish I could, but can anyone remotely comprehend what all this means? No. They think I am mad. They think I am too complicated. They think I don't seem to be what I am. They say I am a hypocrite. An asshole.  If you see it that way, I am sorry.  I tend to get lost in myself. I indulge in moments that allow to me to live. Like a real person. Not a broken man. I see sadistic pleasure in torture. Pain. Suffering. I feel alive, but at what price? I am ostracized. Misunderstood by people whom I would throw my life away for. Thats okay. I have always been taken for granted. Taken for the ride of my life.  I have always been very peculiar with words. It is by no pure coincidence that I manage my GP so well. Have I not sacrificed my time to hone my writing? Have I not had experiences that would make you gasp the moment you heard them? Do you even care to understand why I sometimes do STUPID things and then look unremorseful for them?  I do cry. You don't see it.  Qadir is probably the only person I have been with in the past few days. He supplies a need. He works with me. Its only when I am with him that I can move flawlessly, be more bold in speech, in action. With him, I feel alive. Did anyone bother to see what was wrong? No. They saw someone who wanted to make life miserable for them. No one bothered to question. No one bothered to ask.  No one cared.  Those of you who know me know I don't mince my words. I use them careful and concise. I use them to heal and to sting. I use them like they are part of me, and extension. I pour my being into every word, to paint a word picture of perfection.  Then why can't someone drop me a kind word now and then?

       The world has always been an unfair place,   all of us taking part in this rat race,   so many problems we have to face.   Damn, how do we keep up,with this pace?    &nbsp;  Sometimes at the crossroads we arrive,   so many directions that we can strive,   but better so if it were this,   rather than limited,   though it has it's risk.    &nbsp;  Never lose hope in what could be,   possibilities are there,   they always have been,   it's up to you to look within you,   find the spark to develop it true.    &nbsp;  Light may be darkened but never fear,   for even in 12 hours you shall hear,   the crow of dawn come shining through,   all things in Nature must come round,   the Laws will be obeyed, simple or profound.    &nbsp;  Lost you seem though it may not be,   perhaps look harder then you shall see,   not with the eyes of mind and heart,   deny not the sight of soul,   open you senses,    watch the world unfold.    &nbsp;  Complicated it could be,   but simple in its way,   never lose hope,   hold your faith,   and watch troubles fall away.    &nbsp;  Destinatus Contra Incognitus(Resolute against the unknown)    &nbsp;  Take the gamble of faith. Smile always.

        If only you could see,    what would really set my heart free,    and light that darkness bright anew,    then all my sadness be not wasted,    because you care,    to show I mattered.     &nbsp;   If only you would know,    the way I feel for you,    I cannot say, lest my heart,    be turned away,    and in this silence,    I must be shattered.     &nbsp;   If only you would say,    those words to lift my heart,    why must we remain as "just friends"    won't you,    will you not,    give me this chance to make the cut?     &nbsp;   If only I could forget this rage,    this anger breaking me,    to forget about blood,    meat and gore,    and embrace the future,    that I had once seen before.      &nbsp;    If only.      &nbsp;   You knew what you meant to me.      If only.      &nbsp;   Maybe Hell might have a place for me.

      <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>  Very often people ask me why, why I look with that forlorn in my eyes, all I can do is to turn away, and let myself get tormented again.  I want to speak, but I don't know how, to free myself, from the hell I am bound.  Can I not look twice, when beauty is there, Can I not sigh, when possibilities are laid bare?  I am changed so much, I don't know myself, Wanting the past back, where hope was abound.  So when you turn the corner, and hear a sobbing sound, it is just a boy who is feeling down, from having his dreams unwound.  <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>   Fruz has a absolutely sweet kind of look when she is sleeping   *sigh*   Deborah has a "aura of adorableness" on all the time.   *sigh*  I know so MANY nice girls. So MANY. Certain ones would make wonderful prospects, but I don't want to change their direction. I don't want to spoil this quality. Such a pure quality, I cannot touch with my hands.  *sigh*  "Hello. Are you there? I like you very much. Really I do, but I will respect your direction, and I walk away. Again. I have just found out walking is very tiring. So is denying myself. Control. I wish I could just reach out and catch what I want. Impossible. No. I must not. There are too many consequences. Not that I don't want to bear them, but... Will you be willing to bear them with me?"  "I saw you smile today. I felt a rush of blood. A dashing feeling of joy. I wonder if you would also feel this way if I smiled. The mystical smile. In that moment, I capture the beauty, the essence of pure happiness."  "I miss you. And I will keep missing you till the day you say yes."  "Good bye. I must walk away again."  So I must, drift... drift... so slowly. Away. So sad. So sad. Then I cry all over again. Sorry is too late. Sorry cannot mend the vacuum. Sorry...  Is a consolation prize for losers like me.

       To live like there is no tomorrow, no live each day to the fullest.   No more indulging in myself. No more believing that I will fall. I am unbeatable as I have proven many a time. Sensitive, yes. But never weak.  Herald each new day with the call of new battles.  I shall fight this war. My way.  "He forges a blade of red inferno with sheer will and wields it in his hand. The wind blows across the land, the sand sweeping across dunes. With one single arc, he cuts down his would-be assasin before the mand even manages to close in. He knows. He listens to those who bring him messages of danger. He acts. The blade vanishes, and he walks away, in that same old pace, that same old manner. Unmoved. Undefeated."  To whoever posted the comment on yesterday's blog:  Thank you for the wake up call. I appreciate that. I just wish ppl might want to identify themselves when they post. :p  You are right. People have been beaten down, taken it, and rose from the ashes to build empires. I cannot fall because of one setback because there is much more out there waiting to be accomplished.   Thank you, friend.   I suddenly realised I haven't fulfilled what I have preached within the motto of my blog. To strive to become invincible may be impossible, but to strive to become my best isn't. The thing with impossible is what the Adidas ad says, "Impossible is a big word used by small men."  I have been given a most precious gift by yesterday's commentator. The gift of hope. This is one gift I shall cherish forever, and I promise you, whoever you are, that I will live my life to it's fullest to not waste that gift bestowed. No more wallowing in self-pity and anger.  People ask me why the hell do I choose to call myself "Dugu Qiubai". The name has a special significance to me because it is what I strive to become. Dugu has a lonely meaning to it, but underlying it is a determination to be able to stand on my own two feet, to be one, and not reliant on anyone's help or aid. It also signifies the unification of mind, body, heart into the fulfillment of one purpose.  Qiubai has a invincible edge to it. It literally means asking for defeat. Why in the world would I do that, and have I never tasted defeat before?  Yes I have tasted defeat. I didn't like it at all. The reasoning behind the Dugu Qiubai name that I use is to achieve what I feel is the highest level of achievement. The Lone Swordsman. I have heard this said...  "He moves with the wind. The silent steps he takes. Does he run? No. He walks slowly, confidently. He is feared by all, but nearby animals do not take flight on the sight of him. In purpose, he is the wind. His name strikes fear in people's hearts. His blade will see blood whenever it leaves it's sheath. He is the wind, and no one can defeat him."  You see the harmony of man, his weapon and nature. This is a balance I try to achieve. Does anyone know why I enjoy horticulture? It is because I know. I can hear plants speak to me. I touch the earth with my bare hands, and I hear it speak to me. I do not hear or feel, I Hear and Feel. Can I hear a plant sick and dying? Yes. Can I hear soil crying out for water? Yes. People think I am mad. They are right. I am mad with desire. I am mad with emotion. I am mad with overwhelming energy that is my blessing as well as my curse.  Sometimes, the most unexplainable things just become out of reach, as we become more and more complicated, the simple things of life get forgotten. When was the last time you laughed? When was the last time you managed to take a quiet stroll on your own in Nature's cradle? When was the last time you spoke with yourself?  If we all just took time to smell the flowers... perhaps we might discover more...   Perhaps...

      I feel so angry inside. So shut up. I feel so compressed that I think I could implode any minute. I just wish someone would really sit down with me, hear me whine alot, then console me, and say cheer up.  It didn't help that I scored 23% for Math. My mother is breathing down my neck. She almost screamed the house down, and she expects better results. Hell. How do I get better results?  1) Rememdial with Ng  2) My sister can help  3) Tuition  I just cannot understand why my mother won't spend that amount of money for sending me to tuition. It did wonders to my physics, so why won't it do wonders for my Maths. I don't know whats up with me. I always seem to be able to do tutorials without any problem, but when it comes to the big thing, I blow everything up.  *BANG*  Everything is gone. My marks get blown up into dust. WHOOSH!  I am going to get the tuition no matter what. Physics included. I am not going to let myself lag behind while everyone laughs and me in front. That laughing. That incessant laughing. I hate it. I never want to live it again. Never again will I get pushed down and stepped upon. I vowed it then, and I live it everyday of my life.  I just pray that the rest of the results will be much better. I just hope. That faint glimmer.  I really want it, and I sure wish I get it. I hate being poor. I hate being poor. I hate living in the dumps. I hate having to share. Thats why I will be rich. I will have so much money that my children will never have to worry about costs. I want them to understand the value of money, that is, it should be spent well, or it would just be a useless piece of paper.  End of transmission.

        I have just finished playing my piano. Decided the key for the piece I am going to compose. It is going to be in E major. E major... the sound is somewhat far away, yet so close. I cannot fully comprehend what E major feels like, but what I do know is that it feels right for the person I am going to dedicate this piece to. As usual there aren't going to be words, but what are words in a piece? Can they provide body to a piece? Can they bring meaning to a song?  No. No matter how beautifully worded, the sad sounding song can never be worded in a happy way, even worse, when one attempts to sing it in a happy way, no matter how hard the artistic intepretation, someone hearing the piece will feel in one corner of his heart that the piece is sad.    Thats the truth. No one can run away from it.       Truth is such a beautiful thing. It is one of the most wonderous things, because it is after all the one true thing in the whole world. People die for it, people live to hear it, people crave it, people spurn it, people are caught by it, but sometimes people are freed by it. Truth is in essence, the ultimate utopian ideal. It is the epitome of struggle.  Alright I know I am getting negative again. Oh well.  Last thursday, I was in the LT5 again. Maths. I heard two people behind me going...       "Ay, look at the SC, to her right, Daniel Lim's girlfriend."  "Where where?"  "There lor, you see closely"  "I see. That one ar? Daniel Lim's girlfriend?"  "Yes."    It infuriated me to hear her being spoken like that. I sorely wanted to rip the throats of the two guys behind me out. They dared. They dared to look upon her like an object. A MERE OBJECT. Daniel Lim's object. Why? I began to ask. Why has she got to go and get herself into this? Why must she now live in his shadow? Is she happy that way? I hope so. For all my outward hatred towards her, I know that I still do care for her. I will give my life to defend her honour.      I turned her away. I struck her repeatedly with blows that I knew would strike her heart deep. I was cold and heartless. I needed to forget. I needed time away so that I could see things clearly, away from all the anger. I needed to get away from her, so I will not hurt her. I wanted protect her from one thing. Me.      If you ever see this, I am sorry. I know you won't see this, but I have to say this... all those promises I made to you... I will live up to them. Not out of responsibility, but because you have changed my life, and I value that love I once had for you. I would never be the person I am without you. I don't know whether it is for better or for worse, but I thank you for being in my life once, and how heartless can I get when it concerns you? Can I ever leave you in distress?      No.      There is now no one in my life. I am lonely. I blow across the land like the wind, so cold, so lonely, but there is no rest. Not when I am caught in the Tides of Life. I have to fight every moment. I have to now live every moment without you. It is tough, but I have managed. The going has been tough, but I am made stronger by the process.  Now there is someone that I hope to bring into my life, but I don't know. It seems like such a short time... but I think I should give myself another chance at this. It feels like I am just reaching for a life ring, but I don't want the next one to end like this too, but it is going to be hard. Different backgrounds. Different outlooks. I don't even know how similar we are. Half of the time she calls someone else's name instead of mine. She drives me crazy. She is just... difficult to put into words. She is everything, and nothing. Her mystery... Her game.  Should I fall, or should I stand by the cliff and watch the world go by. The skies, the clouds moving in harmony, with me, and Mother Nature holding me in Her cradle?    I have been wondering. Am I too short?      I guess it is easier when you are tall. People see you first, then they look at the guy beside him. Oh well. His sidekick. Nevermind him then, and I just get left behind. It is such small things that affect me. It is such small things take make me wonder whether I ought to trust that person. It is such small things that make me feel like I am worth something to the person. It is such small things that make the difference...  Overall, I should really let nature take it's course. Who knows? Maybe there is really so much that I can do, before Fate takes over. Maybe it is just time for me to watch Nature do her work on me. Maybe it is time for me to Think less and Feel more, let my Inside show through. Will people cherish that vulnerable part of me then? Maybe not, but we shall see... and it is a risk I am willing to take. The piano guy... brought forth.    Come what may... I just hope to stand by you. Not for the past, but for the present. Nothing else matters most now. I want to stand with, by, beside, over, under, on and finally behind you. At least for a moment longer. To have that moment to be ours. For eternity.     My protection will lie with those I bind too. Always.

      "Come on in. I could hear you walking down the hall way. Is that fear I smell on you? Your footsteps... they are not very sure aren't they? They went tap... tap... so lightly, so lightly. That reminds me of someone... but that is not the point now. Come on, take a seat."  The scraping of a chair drawn against the parquet floor. The taking out of a pen. Click. The pen is now on fire. Paper rustling. Click. A tape recorder.  "Now that is going to leave scratches on the floor."  "Sorry sir."  "I hope you don't mind me speaking like this. I have not seen a human face for almost a century now, and I am not prepared to see another one... at least not yet. I know it seems weird talking to the back of a chair, but I hope you understand"  "Yes sir, I am just plain honoured to be here. Writing a biography for such an accomplished person as you sir as crowning glory, it really is."   A century? What a funny person.   "It isn't very funny actually. People who are in my line do live a long time, or at least until they feel that it is time for them to leave."   Great. He can read my thoughts now.     "It is one of my minor powers, and I usually apply them on strangers. You see, people now are not very honest. I have to do all I can to protect my interests."   Powers?     "Yes. You will understand in due time. Now let us begin shall we?"

      The Demonhunter.  "He who walks the night, spurned by the day whose mission has has vowed to carry out. He who walks the shadows, treading the line so thin that his enemies come from both side. He who has so much pain, yet cannot cry out. He who has fought and conquered all, but has never mastered his heart."  "The Demonhunter is Chosen. Training begins at the tender age of 14. Demonhunters are exclusively males. They are trained in the occult and combat, mastering their chosen combat types within a year. Enhanced by their knowledge of spells and chants that call upon the Powers of Nature, their ally, Demonhunters take a path seldom trod upon."  "As the name implies, a Demonhunter cannot leave his sacred duty. Even with his hands full of blood, he must continue his fight. Evil fears the name. Many demons are slayed in the fight, but more will fill the ranks as evil permeates every living being."  "The Demonhunters stand by a code of cleansing the land. To fulfill that great mission, they are caused to be Cursed. Normal humans instinctively feel an abnormal fear of Demonhunters that pushes them away. Eventually. It always happens."  "They cannot learn to love. They have to hate. They know no mercy, and they will go to all ends to meet their needs and mission. They have no qualms of destroying all that stands in their path. Such is the ruthlessness of a Demonhunter. Such is the lengths they would go."  "Yet amongst them there stands a fraction that believes that Evil stands because of all these incessant killing."  "There can be no end to this war. We have to end it one day. Just as good cannot triumph over evil, evil cannot triumph over good. We should use such powers for Neutrality. We cannot stand by and watch innocents get caught in the cross-fire. There must be an end."  "So said one of the Elders within the sect."  "We must learn to love. We must reclaim the humanity that has been deprived of us so that we may better judge good from evil. We cannot be blinded by emotions, yet we also cannot choose to be clouded by the objectivity and strict adherance to the code. Compassion. That word has been lost to the Archives. What ever happened to Benevolence?"  "So said another."  "Emotions? They are something that will kill all of us one day, you mark my words. Emotions hurt. Emotions weaken. Emotions will prevent us from dealing that killing blow that will vanquish evil once and for all. I cannot allow such blind weakness from permeating our Sight, our Mission to slay and conquer darkness. I cannot allow these human frailities to infect anyone, anymore. As such, all of you must die. All of you here have broken the Code that we live by, and I judge you Guilty."  And I killed them all. With bare hands. Strangely, I felt good.

      Shi Yuan's Ten Commandments:  1) Cry not. Crying is a sign of weakness  2) Sing not. Singing scares people away  3) Sleep not in the prescence of an enemy  4) Speak not in circumstances that do not favour  5) Stand not the desecration of Nature and Life  6) Hate not the enemy  7) Love not the unfaithful  8) Learn not the failings of others  9) Bootlick not the people who succeed  10) Respect not those who are intelligent without being smart

      Let me tell you the truth.  I am lonely.  Funny isn't it. When everyone around you says I will always be around. When everyone says that he/she will be your friend. In a blink they are gone, living their own lives, not even giving two cents to how their reactions now affect you. I feel real tired from trying.  Call me over-sensitive. Thanks for the compliment.  Yes I am over-sensitive. I get lonely easily. I begin to brood, I begin to think. I begin to dream of a future that shall be denied be because I place too much faith in a certain something called friendship. Is there true friendship in this world? I don't know. If friendship is the force that allows me to be free, then the only friend I have is Qadir.  If friendship is the pat on the back and a constant companion who will offer you a portal to your masculinity, my friend is Ming Hui. If friendship is the occasional help, very little talk, and a intolerance of my shortcomings, my friend is Deborah. If friendship is keeping me guessing, hiding and seeking, that friend is Fairuz. If friendship is the comfort when I am down, that friend is Nuraini. If friendship is allowing me to solve problems, which I enjoy immensely, that friend is Joy. If a friend was someone who would be there to support when I run into the shadows, that friend is Eleanor. If a friend was someone who would offer me an intellectual challenge, that friend is Hui Wen.  I have lost sight of what a friend means. What does it encompass?  Maybe I am asking too much. Maybe I only see friends as utilities. I am a beast. I have no emotion except to exploit and destroy. Maybe it is not my fault at all, because all my emotions, wasted on people that would throw me away the first moment they could, so that they could embrace others. Others. I am a secondary function. Thanks. Even better, it is my fault, because that would make things simpler.  I was down the whole day. Angry. No one bothered. No one cared. I did not feel like talking to anyone else but Qadir. In the meantime, no one bothered to talk to me, to find out what was wrong. Not even Nuraini. Maybe I was not expressive enough. Maybe I just withdrew so far that no one could reach me. Maybe it is just plain, and I am finding excuses to blame others, that they really don't care.  Don't expect me to care for someone if the person don't give two cents about me.  I want to be myself. People say, "Shi Yuan is so disgusting." Fine. I shall hide away in a mask, till people find out too late. When I try to be myself, no one appreciates it. It is so easy to pick on a negative point and harp on it endlessly. Positive points are for another day. Alright. If you want it that way, then two can play the game.  Can anyone understand my need to communicate on a deeper level? Maybe none of you will ever do so, unless you are Ming Hui. I don't have to know all your secrets, or even how you run your life. I just want to know how you view things, how you like to handle situations, thats all. Too much? Maybe, but thats the way I am. I don't want to go through life, making friends that I hardly speak to after leaving that period where we are forced by circumstances to be together. I want to make friends that last. If that is not what you want, fine. We can walk this stretch of road so superficially that it hurts for me, but don't expect to hear from me, ever again once this road is done.  How many numbers in your phone book do you actually still keep in contact with? I know I still do keep in contact with those in mine. How about yours?  What are you people going to say now? That I stink? I surely deserve it. Thanks anyway.

      you make me feel like I can touch the sky. you make me want to hold you in my eye, my arms, my everything.  I want to be your cradle. I know I have alot to learn, but I am ready.  Let me join you on your journey, let me take away some pain, let me music your sorrow away, let your frustration fade.  Let me hold you, until the End. Lets Begin, This End, Together.  I know I am kiddish, I know I don't always seem quite sane, I know you think I am out of grasp, but you have caught me, in ways you have never, but will, see.  I thank all that is for you. I thank my destiny for you. most of all, I thank myself, to find the courage for you.  Will you do the same for me?

      I hate being lied to.  I don't care whether it is for my good or not. Good natured or bad natured. I hate being lied too. When I placed my friendship in a certain person's hands I expect that person to treasure it. I expect that person to honour that bond. I expect from that person the TRUTH.  The wholesome truth, and nothing but the truth.  I have been lied to.  ><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>  To a certain girl... if you know who you are... please reply.  Your heart is a puzzle, I cannot break, Your mind is too fast, and you forsake...  That I am here for you always, more so on your rainy days, all I ask is for you to remember, me a little...  Give me some love now and then, give me a kind word, and then send, me off to face the world outside...  I want us to be more than friends, but do you even care, about what goes on inside, maybe you do...  that I long to be with you always, to shoulder your troubles, share your triumphs, to write my chapters with you inside?  maybe you don't.  I want to try, even if it is really against all odds. To be there for you, always. Will you say yes, or will I be left standing here alone? Please give me a chance? You are probably going to ignore me after you realise who this goes out to.  Can I believe in you the way you believe in me?  ><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>
