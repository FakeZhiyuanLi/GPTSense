      Today I woke up with a cold maybe? Sore throat stuffy nose and headache maybe allergies. Ari also had the sniffles, so he didn't sleep well last night either. Naya slept well though. This morning after breakfast we played with Naya's new Legos. She is starting to get the hang of them. Then we tried to take a nap because I was exhausted after a restless night and Naya decided that she wanted to stay up. I fell asleep a couple time but Naya played and cried (when I told her to lay down) for 2 hours. Her new thing is to fake cry all the time. I think she has noticed that Ari gets attention and picked up when he cries. At this point I realized she is not going to sleep and she had woken up Eric so we all got up ate and then we washed the dog. And now I am setting up a blog for everyone to see. I am going to try to write in it every night. But we will see.

      Two nights ago when I was going to bed at about midnight, I started going up the stairs, which were almost completely dark, and I thought I saw a moving shadow. My heart started racing and I almost screamed and then it bumped into me and it screamed. Naya had gotten up and was coming to look for me. It took a couple minutes once she knew it was me to get her calmed down, and then she wanted a cup of water. Luckily once she drank the water she went right back to sleep.  Yesterday when we were out playing in the pool, Naya was walking around with Raina's dish and tripped and fell. She kept putting her fingers in her mouth so we thought she had bitten her tongue or bumped her teeth so I gave her a popsicle to take her mind off the pain. It wasn't until about 15 minutes later when we saw where she really hit. She cut the outside of her eye and was beginning to get a nice lump. I posted a couple pictures from just after it happened. It doesn't look to much worse today, I will try to take more pictures as it heals.  Today was the first day this week that our neighbors pitbull Ruby hasn't come to stay with us. Ruby has been trying to tear through our neighbors garage door for months now and she finally got a hole big enough that she could fit. The first day we saw her out she was just wandering the neighborhood so we put her on our porch. After paying almost $200 to get Raina out of the pound 2 years ago we didn't want that to happen to anyone else, and I think unlicensed pitbulls are just euthanized in the Portland area. But anyways, everyday since then Ruby has come over to our gate and barks and whines until someone lets her in. And then her and Raina spend all day ignoring each other. The owners are quite embarrassed that their dog keeps coming over, but Naya loves it. She was quite upset that Ruby wasn't here today, she kept saying "where drudy" and looking out at the porch.

      Our computer is being slowly taken over with spyware and it is getting increasingly harder to get online.&nbsp; Every time I open a new window in explorer it goes to some weird homepage and has a pop up telling me to download some program. Supposedly Earthlink has a spyware blocker and disabler that I spent 3 days installing and figuring out how to work, but all it seems to do is help make the computer slower since it is just another constantly running program. Oh Well. Our&nbsp;6 year old computer is completely outdated anyways.&nbsp; Maybe we will look into getting a new one. Eric has been longing for a laptop.   On a more fun note Naya has started singing songs. Well she hums the tune and then says a few of the words that she knows. Like row row row hm hm hm hm hm mony mony mony hm hm hm hm. she says mony instead of merrily. She also kinda sings twinkle twinkle little star and old McDonald and she thinks it is hilarious when I sing bingo. Jewel is very impressed with her ability to sing to the right tune. I personally can't tell the difference.   We were given a new double stroller from my Creative Memories upline.&nbsp;&nbsp; Naya loves it. The first time we used it Naya wouldn't get out and so we brought it inside with her in it and left it there for a couple days.&nbsp; Don't worry Uncle Erik we still use BOB, it is a much better stroller, in fact we were just noticing the other day that we might have to rotate the tires since the front tire is starting to wear out.

      We are having record breaking temps here in Oregon.&nbsp; I feel like I am melting. It is still 85 in the house at 10pm.&nbsp; It is supposed to get over 100 for the next couple of days. &nbsp;ugh!!  Well, Ari had his 2 month check up today. Here are his stats-  weight:&nbsp; 10#14oz - 50%  height:&nbsp;&nbsp; 22 3/4 in - 75%  Head:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 38cm&nbsp;- 25%&nbsp; ( it appeared that the nurse wasn't measuring his head properly, he&nbsp;was in&nbsp;the 75% at his last check up)  And he is doing very well developmentally, he can do a push up and roll from stomach to back (as you know if you read the earlier post) He is smiling more and more and is talking (cooing a lot) as well as starting to reach for objects and noticing that he is batting his toys around. In other words he is starting to be more fun.   We have been struggling with nap and bedtime lately so Naya has been a little less perfect than usual.&nbsp; And I think her teeth have been bothering her as she has been biting a lot, though for some&nbsp;reason she only bites herself.&nbsp; But,&nbsp;she now has 11 teeth, 6 on top including 2 molars and 5 on bottom, 2 molars as well. This has made eating a little easier on her since she now has some&nbsp;grinding teeth. Though she would live off of cheese if we would let her.&nbsp; Now that she knows the sign for cheese that is all she asks for.&nbsp; speaking of eating, Uncle Erik would be happy to here that she eats with a spoon with her left hand.&nbsp; I believe she is still right hand dominant though.   She is still in love with her new shoes. We did 3 shoe changes today.&nbsp;&nbsp;Including my favorite pink socks with her red Tevas. Eric did it, I don't think I would have let her get away with it.&nbsp; She was showing off her shoes to everyone she could at Starbucks again today.&nbsp; Also at starbucks, she spilled Eric's Passion Tea Lemonade and Raina started licking it up, so Naya leaned down and was trying to lick it up as well.&nbsp; It was quite funny.

      My mother came to stay with us this weekend, and we all went to Nordstrom's half yearly sale&nbsp;to go shoe shopping as Naya is now a size 6 and had outgrew all of her old shoes.&nbsp; Naya really enjoyed trying on the shoes and looking at the bottoms since one pair had a fish and a sea star on the bottom.&nbsp; So now yesterday when she had her rub-a-dub (bath) she refused to take off her shoes. So we compromised and she took off her tennis shoes&nbsp;and wore her Teva's instead.&nbsp; then I had to convince her to take them off for bed.&nbsp; And this morning she has been practicing putting her own shoes on and off, it is quite cute because she can't quite get her foot in all the way so she walks around with her heel up on top like a high heel.&nbsp; First she put on her white fish sandals and we got the mail, then she wanted to put on her tennis shoes and go for another walk, and then she put on her old dress shoes and ran back and forth across the kitchen to hear the clicking sound.&nbsp; After her nap when we went to Starbucks she had to keep showing her shoes to everyone.&nbsp; Normally we don't wear shoes in the house but it hasn't been worth the battle to get Naya to take off her new shoes.   &nbsp;

      On tuesday we went to the zoo. We didn't know it when we went but tuesdays are free and it was teh last free tuesday ever. So There were like 10 million people there.&nbsp; I think that Naya was a little young to have to much fun yet. She did like watching the otters swim back and forth, well she liked it but was kind of afraid.&nbsp; And she pretty much calls every animail a moo (cow) or a doggy.&nbsp; We saw a monkey trying to pee on people, that was pretty funny.&nbsp; When I was standing in line waiting to buy my elaphant ear I had Ari in the sling trying to feed him and a lady tried to get a closer look at him and realized I was breastfeeding. She was very embarrassed and apologized profusely, I kept telling her it was alright, I was standing in a public place. &nbsp; Yesterday Great-grandma and Grandpa and&nbsp;Great uncle Tom and Teela and Kelsey stopped by on thier way home from the family reunion.&nbsp;Naya had fun playing with her cousins and Ari just sat contently whereever he was put.&nbsp; He is always on his best behaviour when we have company it is quite funny.  &nbsp; Today We went to the poo (Naya's word for pool) at our old apartments.&nbsp; Naya wore her flotation vest but was still a little scared .&nbsp; We took the diesel volkswagen there and Naya thought that was cool since it has a fuel delivery problem and likes to die any time we stopped Eric had to keep revving it up. So Naya was sitting in the back going&nbsp;mrum-rum&nbsp;and whoa over and over. &nbsp;

      Yesterday we went to a Heritage Festival at a church near our house. Naya was a bit young for the stuff there like bobbing for apples and ring toss, but she did enjoy the petting zoo. There were like 8 pygmy goats. She kept calling them doggy except for the black and white spotted one was moo. There were pony rides as well but she was afraid of the ponies so I didn't make her go on it. Though it would have been funny to have a picture of her on a horse looking pissed like the picture of me on the horse. Then we went to a new dog park to check it out. Raina didn't really like it but Naya enjoyed picking up apples that had fallen off of a tree. She could carry about 4 at a time. We had to keep stopping her from eating them. Today was a lazy day since it was sooo hot. The thermometer inside says it is still 80 inside and it is midnight. We played in our wading pool but it was hot as well. It has a piece of clear plastic over it to keep the bugs out so it heats up nicely when the sun shines on it.

      It has been an eventful couple of weeks with a couple of "firsts" since I posted last. Naya has been learning new words left and right. Some of the pronunciations are very cute. Like money is pronounced molomny just try to say money while sticking out your tongue. She really likes to stick out her tongue on words like Alan and hello watermelon and elbow. Actually elbow and knee are her two favorite words at the moment. Well those and poop which can mean poop or diaper or pee or genitalia.  But back to the "firsts" Naya had her first bandaid which is quite amazing since she is over a year and a half old. But we were walking and she tripped and skinned her knee. She didn't cry she just looked up and said "knee...Knee...KNEE" very pitifully. Eric got to play doctor and cleaned it all up. The next day she had to wear shorts because she wanted to keep her eye on her bandaid, and the next day I had to put a new bandaid on. But I think she is over that now.  On the 4th Eric and I found out the hard way that Ari can roll over. He rolled off of the bed. After the initial screaming he seems to be unaffected by the whole incident. He did have a little rug burn on his forehead for a day or two. But I think we are going to have a very active little boy on our hands, Naya didn't roll over until she was a little over 3 months.  He has also been smiling a lot well for me at least. No one really believes that he smiles because he is still kind of a grump for anyone else. Naya has started having the occasional night terror as well. She starts crying in her sleep for about 20 minutes or so and I can't wake her up. Then she just stops and stays asleep. I think it is because her imagination is developing so well. She just isn't able to turn it off at night.  I also think she has an imaginary friend named Debby. She will sit and talk to Debby with her toys for 20 minutes or so, or she will just keep saying Debby Debby over and over again. Well that is about it for now hopefully I will keep up on this better as time goes on.

      Hello again. The computer is on its last legs so I have been unable to work on it much. It is making horrible noises and I think the graphics card is going out. We have weird stripes going across the screen and all of the colors are off, plus all of the spyware problems. I was just trying to make a backup CD of my pictures while writing this and now the CD writer and the picture software aren't working either. I got the blue screen of death. Argh! I was going to upload a couple of pictures but we will see how it works.  Other than all of that life has been good. Jewel got a car so we went to the beach on Sunday and had a great time. Naya was playing on the slide and everything was going fine until somehow, I spaced out for a second and I didn't catch her. She landed OK but bumped her head on the slide. She still wanted to go on the slide but didn't really trust me anymore. So I had to hold her the whole way down the slide. I still feel bad about it, but hopefully I can regain the trust. Ari got his first ride in the BOB stroller while we were at the playground he thought that was neat since he could sit up and watch what was going on.  Another funny story, a couple days ago I thought I saw a hair on Ari's lip so I tried to brush it off and it wouldn't come off. Then I realized it was going up his nose so I tried to pull it out thinking it was just lying there. It still wouldn't come off. So Eric tried to get it and couldn't so I wrapped it a little around my finger and pulled and got it. It was like 2 inches long and growing out of his nose. I was thinking that doesn't bode well for him as he gets older if he already has crazy nose hair.  Yesterday, when I was putting Naya to sleep I was changing both kids into their PJs and while Ari was naked I blew a raspberry on his tummy, and Naya thought it was hilarious so now she wants to blow on his tummy every chance she gets. Naya has been fascinated with tummies since Eric does the "tummy dance", where he sucks in and pushes out his stomach really fast. Naya tries to do it to and can't quite do it but still thinks that it is the greatest thing on earth. She just loves everything Eric does. SO right now we have a daddy's girl and a Momma's boy.  Well I am going to go back to trying to figure out what is up with the computer. Wish me luck.
