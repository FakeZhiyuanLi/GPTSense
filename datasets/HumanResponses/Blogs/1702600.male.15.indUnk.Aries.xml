      The second first post in the history of The Asylum.  I want you all to welcome to Anders Sørensen, the new co-owner of The Asylum.  There's still space if you want to join us. Just send me an e-mail and we'll talk.

      While I was sitting in my permanently dark gamer cave, enjoying the freedom known as not having to go to school for three months and reading entire webcomic archives just to have something´(Slightly) amusing to do, and the last page of MacHall appeared on my screen, I received a call from Anders who apparently had decided to save me from the clutches of boredom; Yes, a LAN party. And a long one it is. Here I am, on my last day, with bloodshot eyes and (Even more?) greasy hair from being completely depraved of sleep for the last 48 hours (twice) and this 5-day Jedi-academy/Battlefield Vietnam marathon is coming to an end. I was just about to plan my return to said Den without getting shot by the RIAA sniper that I'm pretty sure I can see on a rooftop across the street, when I thought of the Asylum. Lacking ideas for my escape, and anything better to do - I decided to fill the few of you who actually come here every once in a while in with a few of the cooler details.  My hard drive is humming tiredly, as my share is repeatedly raped (almost literally) by my two dear friends who apparently have discovered the beauty of Ren'ai (dating sim/visual novels which somehow incorporate romance and/or hentai) games and Love Hina episodes, whilst I harvest mp3 after mp3 from 11 of the thirteen Neon Genesis Evangelion CDs in existence... Ahh the sweet smell of burned plastic... Oh, crap... That's my hard drive...   Battlefield Vietnam, I've found, is an incredible game. It manages to be fun, but keeps the possibility killing 10 Vietnamese soldiers with nothing but a revolver (or the 'Clint', as we call it ^_-) - which is a feature I'd like to see in a few other decently fun games. Although Counter-Strike probably wouldn't make that much sense with Vietnamese people running around.  Joke aside; I'd say that this has been an incredible party, and apart from being bragged repeatedly at the Halflife Dragonball mod Earth's Special Forces (quite fun, actually. Especially counting the fact that DBZ is one of the most tedious and slow-progressing series in the history of mankind, only surpassed by "days of our lives". No comment needed. Yuck.) nothing has really been a problem. And that's quite rare in LAN parties. In fact, I don't believe it's ever happened to me before ^.^  I must bid you Sayonara for now, as the sounds my stomach is making clearly indicates that I might not have eaten enough toast yet. That, or I'll O.D. on bread and ham.
