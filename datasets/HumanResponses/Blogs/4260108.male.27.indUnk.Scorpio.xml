      “My Creator, I am now willing that you should have all of me, good and bad.  I pray that you now remove from me every single defect of character which stands in the way of my usefulness to you and my fellows.  Grant me strength, as I go out from here, to do your bidding.  Amen.”

      "God, I offer myself to Thee--to build with me and to do with me as Thou wilt.  Relieve me of the bondage of self, that I may better do Thy will.  Take away my difficulties, that victory over them may bear witness to those I would help of Thy Power, Thy Love, and Thy Way of life.  May I do Thy will always!"

      My lawn is a reflection of my soul.  Sometimes it gets way out of control.  I took a whack at it about a week ago after a month and a half of pretending it was not there. My 6.0 horsepower mower couldn't handle it without stalling several dozen times.  The cool thing about mowing after so much neglect was finding a plant with deep purple blooms growing right outside my kitchen window.  I mowed around this happy accident.  It was like finding a needle in a haystack that I wasn't looking for.  Analogy aside, I really could have made several of those large round hay bales with all those weed and grass clippings.

      Beautiful song set to Finlandia http://my.voyager.net/~jkhodges/sound/Song18.htm                   1. This is my song, Oh God of all the nations,                        A song of peace for lands afar and mine.                        This is my home, the country where my heart is;                        Here are my hopes, my dreams, my sacred shrine.                        But other hearts in other lands are beating,                        With hopes and dreams as true and high as mine.                     2. My country's skies are bluer than the ocean,                        And sunlight beams on cloverleaf and pine.                        But other lands have sunlight too and clover,                        And skies are everywhere as blue as mine.                        Oh hear my song, oh God of all the nations,                        A song of peace for their land and for mine.                     3. This is my prayer, O Lord of all earth's kingdoms,                        Thy kingdom come; thy will be done.                        Let Christ be lifted up till all men serve him,                        And hearts united learn to live as one.                        Oh, hear my prayer, thou God of all the nations.                        Myself I give thee; let thy will be done.
