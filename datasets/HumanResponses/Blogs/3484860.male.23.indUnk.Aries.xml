      I have an assessment scheduled for Wednesday!!! So much for the shortage of clients.  We called landlord last night and he said he'd get someone out asap, but since it's Memorial Day, it may have to wait 'til Tuesday.  Ugh.  It's hot.  But, my computer works fabulously now!! More to come...

      Just saw   The Day After Tomorrow.    I'll go ahead and give it a "B."  It was okay, but there was something corny about it that the movie could just never shake.  I did enjoy, however, seeing L.A. finally be destroyed by deadly tornadoes; I guess all those letters to big Hollywood producers finally paid off.  It was great to see the other natural disasters.  The weather geek in me (what's still left) enjoyed all the special effects that simulated weather disasters.  It made me smile to see all the storms. :) Back to the corny part....the movie tried to mix real disaster with some mushy love and a father's undying promise to his son.  I mean come on, let's walk 80 miles to save your son who's probably already dead.  The movie's focus ended up moving from the great special effects and storms and instead focused on the dad's quest to retrieve his son.  I don't understand why the dad was coming to NYC from the water when he was supposed to be coming from Philly.  I think the movie was just trying to bank on all the cool shots, like the Statue of Liberty frozen.  Some of the "real" aspects of the movie didn't make sense, but I guess that doesn't matter.  A part I loved: I LOVED the part where all the Americans were crossing the Rio Grande into Mexico! And how the Mexicans temporarily stopped all immigration into Mexico! Look at all those American wetbacks, how wonderful. :) How quickly America packs their shit and heads to the third world when things get a little too real.  Thanks, Mexico, for keeping it real.  I guess the movie's message was that we can't keep burning expensive gas and buying more Hummer H2's or else we're gonna freeze.  I don't know why I should worry, according to the movie, Texas will be fine.  I'd love to go to Mexico, anyway, and maybe I'd spend some time in Africa.  Again, I give the movie a "B;" it was good but not exceptional.  It was great to see all the floods and tornadoes and such, but as far as character development and story line, it kinda lacked.  Goodnight!

      I LOVE the "Karen" commericals on MTV! If you know what I'm talking about then you know what I'm talking about, haha.  She's terrific.  I stayed up last night just long enough to catch the end of a documentary on race in America on PBS.  Yes, I'm a dork.  The doc. really pulled a lot of my thoughts on race together and it was wonderful.  I have a friend who says she's colorblind and only looks at people, not race.  It's ridiculous, as the doc said, to think that the only way we are going to improve on our race relations is by ignorning race.  Some famous writer once said something like "To end racism, we must at first consider race."  Racism in America has been supported by our judicial system for centuries.  To be American was, in the past, to be white, and the government, for a long time, defined "whiteness."  After declaring that those from Caucasian descent and finally, African descent could be legal American citizens, countless others, especially from Asian countries, had to prove to the American government that they were worthy of being considered "white."  Thus, being white was to be fully American and have most, if not all, priveledge.  Countless numbers of Asians, Indians (India), etc. tried to prove their whiteness to our leaders.  They attended Christian churches, totally assimilated to American culture, spoke only English, dressed and ate like Americans, basically denying and leaving their culture of origin behind.  Nevertheless, they were denied American citizenship.  Being white was priveledge from the government, who was also white.  It was circular logic: whiteness was defined by whites and only whites knew white when they saw white.  After WWII, and even though civil rights had allowed freedom to African Americans, racism continued (de facto rather than de jure) in the form of housing opportunities.  When GI's returned from the war, both black and white, both groups anticipated starting their new lives in America and buying new homes.  Whites built Levittowns where blacks were not allowed.  Blacks were forced into cities, where most of the property was rental property. You can't build equity by renting.  Whites were able to pass along capital and wealth to their children while blacks and Latinos were left with little to trickle down, therefore stunting their status in society.  To be white was to be priveledged, have the best schools, have wealth in the way of home ownership, and to continue that wealth by passing it along to their children.  Once blacks starting moving into white neighborhoods, property value plummeted as whites retreated, sold their homes, and moved away quickly ("white flight"). This left African Americans in suburbs, but with homes that were worth a fraction of what they should be, especially if they were physically located in a white neighborhood.    I don't know why I got into all this! Sometimes I feel like an anthropologist trapped in a clinical psychology program.  On a lighter note, I can't wait to see all the great  movies  coming out this summer! GO SEE SUPER SIZE ME if you haven't already! It's genious!  P.S. Please excuse typos!

      OK, so the last post doesn't give much to comment on.  I'm really glad Fantasia won American Idol.  One of my friends cried when she won, :).  That Diana chick bothers me, she's like 12 years old and already dull and lifeless.  Anyway. It's hot here and that means the summer is fast approaching.  Another summer of hell-like heat.  I can't wait to start taking my Spanish courses this summer.  I want to live in Mexico for an extended period of time.  I want to go to Boston for my internship.  I want, I want, I want.   So, what annoys me is people debating the beheading video.  People are like, well, was he already dead when they cut his head off, or was he still alive? How long had he been dead? 10 minutes? 15? People, you're stuck in the details.  Who cares.  What matters is that someone was beheaded.  Sigh.  People don't get it sometimes.  It's these geeks who sit around and wonder about the stupidest shit all day that end up realizing that they've wasted the day.  I hate it when people use terms like "fag," "gay," or "queer" in their everyday language, like "that's gay," or "that's queer."  This language is rediculous.  Grow up everyone, and get your head out of your high school locker.  Those words are hateful and have no place in everyday language.  How is something gay? How are situations gay? Do they have sexual intercourse with other situations of the same gender? Is that sensical? People are bizarre.

      This is my first blog experience! I thought I'd give this a try and see if this is an appropriate place for my rants, musings, bitchings, and thoughts on the world around me.  The title of my blog is tentative; I'm Mexican American, so I'm not a Mexican citizen, but it's fun to include that in the name nonetheless.  I hope to make this a safe place for me to scream at the world and hopefully get some useful feedback, in addition to starting some discussion on world events.  Thanks!

      so i like a lot of lemon/lime juice in my guacamole.  i havent met too many other people out there that enjoy the same.  i dont understand that.  to me, avocado is near tasteless without some fresh lemon or lime juice and some salt.  i made chicken fajitas tonight, so im ranting. forgive me.  la mujer comes home tomorrow.  as i reflect back on my 10 days alone, i realize that i was okay.  i made it! im clean, shaved, fed, well dressed, and healthy, and i did it without the hand of a woman.  that's important to me.  i do need to get a haircut, though.  i think ill try and go on wednesday.  ive gone to the same barber in my hometown for several years, a little mom and pop type place run by mexicans where most of the customers are mexicans and speak spanish, and where they play mexican music most, if not all, of the time.  i wish i could get a haircut there. but im here. sometimes i miss lazy days in new braunfels.  i miss mom and dad.  most of the time, i just miss and long for anywhere but here.  i talked to one of my best friends from back home yesterday. he asked me to be one of his groomsmen in his upcoming wedding.  i was thrilled to accept.  he's one of the kindest and greatest people ive ever met, and his fiance/future wife is great too.  im glad and honored to be able to do this for him.  south park on comedy central is hilarious.  i caught some of it during dinner and they were doing a spoof on racism, but making the black people super rich and the poor people white.  the white people were doing hate crimes against the rich blacks, but not for their race, but for their money. haha.    so ask me what my  true  calling is, and I'd tell you that a dream of mine is to rent an RV and travel across country investigating reported incidences of paranormal activity.  i want to be a ghost hunter! i was watching the travel channel's "weird travels" show, and i just love it.  i love halloween time because the travel channel does a superb job of showing a bunch of travel themed shows that highlight haunted places in america and abroad (hotels, gettysburg site, new orleans, cemetaries, etc.) that you can visit, and that many people do visit.  i love ghosts, the paranormal, hauntings, monsters, myths, legends, sightings, etc.  call me crazy.  i love it!  i hate that by about 900pm i'm exhausted and ready for bed, yet i have a ton of work still to do.  i hate reality shows that think its cute to make people eat disgusting things.  i want to quit my on-campus work study job because its stupid.  i mean, it is easy money and way flexible, but its stupid and im a graduate student and the stupidity should have stopped long ago.  my bosses are great but they have me do stupid shit just for the sake of doing it.  i told them weeks ago that during summer I session I would only be able to work MWF, yet today my boss asks me if there is any way i can come in tomorrow (tuesday/martes for you spanish kids) because she gave me something TODAY that she needs to be finished by WEDS MORNING.  haha, i dont come in again until Weds afternoon lady.  so sad that you waited until the last minute to get it done.  i dont even feel qualified to do what she wants me to do anyway.  she wants me to check the new grad students transcripts to see if theyve taken certain undergrad prereqs for certification at the masters level.  i dont know much about speech and hearing sciences.  i dont want to do it. leave me alone. i want to quit.  Currently Listening: Alicia Keys,  The Diary of Alicia Keys  Currently Wishing I Was Reading: John Knowles,  A Separate Peace   Props to tink porn and to websites that worship ninjas.  you people make me lol.  also, you must http://www.ebaumsworld.com/cartoons.shtml  play around, watch the media, lose yourself.  it's well worth it.

      I don't think I've ever been so struck and in awe by a movie.  Moore's latest,  Fahrenheit 9/11 , affected me more than words can say.  This movie invigorates me and moves me so much that I almost want to quit graduate school, apply to law school, and spend my life fighting for social justice and justice in general.  I want to get a masters in social work and be a street-level practitioner in the poorest neighborhoods.  I want to get a Ph.D. in anthropology and immerse myself in different cultures, lifeways, religions, and politics.  I want to email P and see how I can become active in the local Democratic party.  I don't know how to express how this movie affected me.  A dear friend of mine wept for at least half of the movie.  I laughed, I genuinely teared up, and I sat in awe, thinking that certainly I was in the twilight zone.  The line to get in the movie was endless, and security was heightened.  We cheered, we were absolutely silent, and time seemed to not exist during the duration of this approximately 2 hour movie/documentary.  At one time I felt like I had been sitting in the theater for an eternity, just listening in true shock and awe.    I feel like I've been given the gift of knowledge after watching this movie; problem is, now I feel like I don't know what to do with this newly acquired gift.  When I first changed my major to psychology, my original plan was to double major in political science, because I was really getting into the issues and politics.  I guess what I need is a safe outlet to do my part in the political cause I believe in.  This movie was raw, explicit, graphic, and passionate.  I felt like I was experiencing what the people on the screen were experiencing firsthand.    I don't know what to say.  This movie disgusted me and invigorated me at the same time.  This movie made me want to be a bigger and better Democrat.  This movie made me dislike the republicans to the nth degree.  This movie ignited something in me.  I don't know what will result.

      im drunk right now, or at least coming down off my buzzzzz.  so a friend of mine said some foul shit tonight.  he talked shit about my girl (friend). im so tired of people judging and projecting their shit onto others. i know i have been guilty of this myself.  dont call her a fucking snobby ass bitch and think youre cool. dammit.  no one gets to know her and they just judge her by her handbag.  build bridges and dont break them down, you know? live like a christian if you say you are and dont just get mad at girls that are pretty and that are the kind of girl you could never get.  i dont feel guilty for making so many friends.  i know i say i feel like im a lone sometimes but really i know im part of the popular crowd.  i know that 20 peopel came to my bday party because i am friends with them all.  dont hate becuase ive made good friends and am accepting even though youre angry.  i know im socially anxious but i know im good and i think people see that.  im pissed because i feel like i didnt defend my friends honor.  so what if she doesnt want to go drink.  thats her choice.  there is more than one way to get to know a person. grrrrrrrrrrrrrr  severe props to A&B for picking up my drunk ass tonight.  you guys kick ass!

      So today is hump day.  I am tired.  What's new.  I had dinner last night with an amazing friend here in the program.  Not With Penis secretely IMed my friend and told her to take me out for our anniversary.  It was great conversation and great food.  I was really tired though.  We were talking so much and I was so tired that I felt like I had been drinking (tipsy feeling).  I got immediately anxious during the middle of our conversation for no reason, I don't know why.  Maybe it was the sleep deprivation? On top of that my contacts were super dry and I had tired eyes.  Sleep deprivation is killer.  I hope I didn't say anything stupid in front of her.  Today should be chill.  Work and then work out and then study for spanish test tomorrow.  more soon?

      [I would have typed "anos," the spanish word for years, but I can't type the ~ here over the "n", and "anos" without it is actually the plural of "anus."]  I'm so undeserving.  So today is Girl and I's 6 year anniversary of when we started dating (throwback to 1998).  She's so much more expressively romantic than I am.  It's probably just how I've been socialized. ;)  Anyway, so we exchanged cards before girl left and told each other not to open them until 06/22.  I just opened mine.  I have been shown up again.  I gave her a card that was fun and that I wrote a good deal in, but that's it.  She gives me a card that she wrote some great stuff in, but that also contained a Clue, Clue #1.  Female Species led me on a scavenger hunt around the house that highlighted all the things that we've done together and that are important to us, that we saw each other through, etc (i.e. my bachelor's degree, pottery from Mexico, spanish dictionary, etc.)  There were 5 clues in all, with one written in spanish (that I am pleased to say I did not have to get help in translating!).  At the end of the scavenger hunt was a framed picture.  The picture is one she apparently enlarged that we took as the sun was setting in Cozumel during spring break (absolutely beautiful, like heaven on earth).  On the picture are superimposed words that describe our relationship and what makes it strong (trust, commitment, love, etc.)  God, I would never have thought of doing something like that.  I always feel like it's so one-sided when we exchange gifts.  Not necessarily in price, but in thought behind it.  I guess I'm just awkward in yet another way, in expressing my lovey-dovey feelings and emotions.  Maybe someday I'll snap out of it???

      I want to see Moore's F9/11 desparately, but I'm afraid they're going to bomb the theaters where it's showing.  I was watching Scarborough Country tonight on MSNBC and they were saying Moore was anti-American and that he supported the enemy.  I can't take republicans.  They're pure evil.  It's a bitch to live on your own and have to take care of everything yourself (cleaning, food, etc.) Props to the peeps out there who came here alone and are still alone.  I was so tired today.  I was like falling asleep giving the WJ (ok, not REALLY, but was feeling like it...) I had to talk all animated just to keep myself awake.  There just isn't enough time in the day to do everything that needs to get done.    You know, there's been lots of discussion lately concerning the integrity of our program.  Since there are people in it (several) that threaten the integrity, I think it kind of gives those of us who have integrity the chance to really shine in this program.  I guess this is just me making lemonade out of piss water, but it seems like a lot of the students and faculty have grown accustomed to mediocrity at best.  Who am I to talk, really??? Don't get my wrong, there are still plenty of exceptional students here, but I guess just not as many as I thought would be here.  maybe this is me just being an arrogant bitch.  maybe this is just me being real on my blog. who knows.

      so I talked with one of my best friends here at school today and feel really bad.  you know, sometimes the right thing to do and the right attitude isn't the popular one.  I'm starting to realize that some of the people in the program enjoy forming elite groups where they actively and openly leave other people out.  these other people are some of the best people one could ever meet, but this elite group of the popular kids won't have anything to do with them.  lately ive been thinking that those who exclude others, those who hate on others, and those who roll their eyes at others are really rolling their eyes and hating on themselves.  dont get me wrong.  ive been guilty of these thoughts and behaviors.  but i think i need to change.  theres a lot of unacceptance in the program.  its almost like you have to be kind of a slacker and pretend not to take things too seriously in order to fit in with the popular kids.  im starting to think that i dont care if i get shunned and sent into exhile, as long as i do what is right.  im starting to realize that more and more people in this program are truly fucked up.  everyone has their problems, this we all know.  however, in this profession of clinical psychology, i think we hold a responsibility to our clients and to the integrity of our profession to have our shit together.  we need to be stable. we need to make responsible decisions, and when we dont, realize the mistake.  we need to be good citizens.  we dont need to be fucking our classmates and slacking heavily and forgetting morals and forgetting reason and treating people like shit and lying and being incredily selfish.  im ranting, but im ranting the truth.  shape up or ship out, clinical students.

      so I just got done drinking the new C2 Coca-Cola and it's pretty good.  It tastes like real coke, but with half the sugar and half the carbs.  I'm not counting carbs, but I thought I'd give it a try anyway.  I felt so trendy buying it. haha.  today I saw a truck on the highway with white men in the cab and mexicans riding in the open trailer it was pulling.  they looked like day workers.  that made me mad.  i know that sounds stupid.  i get mad when i see things like that.  it just sucks.  just picked up Alicia Keys' latest albums, "The Diary of Alicia Keys." It's outstanding! True talent, true art, real music.  Great stuff! I gave my presentation today in spanish and I was so nervous.  My prof said I did great and that I have good pronunciation, but I think I sound funny.  I'm already nervous to talk in front of people, but in spanish I'm even more nervous.  I think I'm going to continue taking spanish in the fall and spring semesters.  After the summer I will have taken Elementary Spanish I & II which I could have gotten university credit for, had I not taken the classes CE.  I will be crazy busy in the fall and spring; however, I don't want to lose touch with spanish.  Since I'll be busy, I'm probably going to take the Beginning Conversational Spanish CE course they offer at TCC-NW campus.  TCC-NW offers tons of great spanish classes, many for CE credit.  Conversational Spanish, unlike the one im taking now which is like a full lab lecture 4 hour class, is focused more on practical spanish conversation, not so much hispanic culture, language, grammar, etc like the one im in now.  the conversational spanish courses meet once a week.  this will work great with my schedule.  this way i can keep up with spanish without taking too much of my time. i really hope I can continue taking spanish courses every semester.  I think I'm out of thoughts for now.  Oh yeah, I wonder if president Clinton's new book "My Life" will be worth reading.  They're showing a tell-all interview with him tomorrow night with Dan Rather where he talks about why he had an affair.  I think Bill also talks about it in his book.

      I'm tired today.  Client: Are you Egyptian? Clinician: No. (silence, time passes) Clinician: My family is actually from Mexico. Client: You're a Mexican??? Wow, you're an intelligent Mexican!!! Clinician: Well thank you.  The Simple Life 2 premiers tonight, don't miss it! Those 2 crazy stupid bitches are tearing across our country in search of, well, nothing more than to make money and make asses of themselves, per our enjoyment. I have a presentation to give tomorrow about my family in Spanish and I have to make a visual aid (i.e. poster).  I haven't made a poster since my lame teachers in high school made us make them.  What will I do? If I had it my way and had no boundaries, I would simply write the above dialogue on a white poster board with black marker.  That makes a statement.  That's art.   Girl leaves in 3 days for Mexico.  I will be here alone for 10 days.  Will I perish? Will I die of starvation because a woman isn't here to cook for me?  Will I have the will to groom myself and eat? Tune in to find out.  For sure I'll be a bit lonely but also should be able to get some cleaning up done, organizing, pleasure reading (no re-reading the text when bored here), and some alone quiet time....

      I've been Saved! Just got back from seeing the movie, and it was brilliant, brilliant, brilliant.  Also picked up John Knowles' "A Separate Peace" today at B&N....one of my all time favs that shows the dark side to human nature.....  A I think you'd love the movie, love this book, and another I want to suggest to you....more later.  went to a good friend's baby shower today and had a good time.  was one of those days where you thank all the gods and spirits for giving you wonderful people in your life.  cheers to exceptional friends.....

      People who smell horrible shouldn't be allowed to work out at the rec center.  Case in point: the other day I had just started running on the treadmill when a guy got on the treadmill next to mine and he smelled so bad, so bad that I almost threw up in my mouth while running.  I quickly terminated my running session and had to move down to another treadmill.  Tonight is the MTV Movie Awards! Don't miss it.  If you didn't already hear, Britney had a small accident Tuesday during the taping of her new music video (for her single "Outrageous" off of "In The Zone") which will be used as the theme song for the upcoming movie "Catwoman."  In the video, Britney gets mugged in NYC and it's Catwoman who saves her, yay Catwoman.  Well, during the shoot she slipped and fell on the slick pavement and had to be rushed to a doctor for orthoscopic surgery for her knee...she had floating cartilage due to her fall, in which she fell on her knee.  This may impact her summer tour schedule, but she should recover nicely.  We're all behind you, Brit.  In other news, the rain has ceased and the sun is out again.  Yay for summer.  More later.

      I remember back in Aggieland, the weekend began on Thursday night.  Not that I was much of a partier, but when Thursday night rolled around, it was always a sigh of relief.  I miss College Station and A&M sometimes, naturally.  Great eats (I love you, Wings n' More), great shopping, and excellent housing for students throughout the city.  I don't miss the conservatism and uniracial makeup of the student body, though.  Had my first spanish test today, and I think I did excellent! I'm really enjoying that class.  I want to study abroad in Mexico for a semester! I wonder if there was some clinical program there I could do for a semester or something, how fun would that be?  Would have to be after several semesters of Spanish, though....  It's been raining tons in the area the last couple of weeks, causing a lot of flooding.  The ground is soggy and muddy. yuk.  My monitor is dusty.  Big PROPS to A&P for giving some outstanding supervision yesterday.  As always, I welcome and appreciate the guidance from my superiors.

      today i was FINALLY able to access my online lab manual for spanish.  the damn company gave me sign in code that was already used by someone else, so my profesor had to contact them and get them to send me a new one.  good thing im taking this course as CE.  i still have a cough that i cant shake.  maybe its because i dont sleep enough and so my body doesnt have enough time to repair and heal.  typing the word "shake" made me think of Steak n' Shake restaurant in Lewisville, they have amazing shakes but I swear I thought the sugar was going to pour out of all my orifices while drinking.  still raining today.  i love the rain.  lazy days with rain outside and the occasional thunder are some of my favorite.    i thought this would be longer but i guess not.  i want to try to nap and eat some before i go to work at 100.  i dont want to be dazed when i meet with A and P for some much needed supervision.

      I've been thinking about friendships.  Sometimes I feel that I need my friends more than they need me.  This sometimes leads to feelings that I am too dependent on others, causing me to want to push myself away from them.  This in turn causes me to feel bad that I am distancing myself from people I care about on the basis of my insecurities.  It seems like I experience this cycle and these feelings several times during the course of friendships in my life.  I feel awkward trying to make new friends partly because I feel like people already have solid friendship/social support bases before I meet them, and I feel like I don't, so then I feel it becomes a case of me needing another person more than they "need" me; I'm the one trying to form the social support base and everyone else is not because they already have it.  This is the way I see the world sometimes.

      Well, it's Monday.  I love blogs because you don't have to type in complete sentences.  A recap of the weekend: Brandi had girls night with her friends from work Friday night, which gave me some time alone and some peace and quiet, which I enjoyed.  The cats did, however, keep it from being completely tranquil.  Saturday morning Brandi and I woke up early and participated in a 5K (3 mile) run/walk to benefit Communities in Schools of North Texas; Communities in Schools is sort of a social work agency that helps out disadvantaged kids in area schools by getting them clothes, presents for holidays, meals, etc.  It's a wonderful cause, and there was a HUGE turnout (many D/FW area businesses sent runners).  I was proud that I ran/jogged most of the 3 miles, but there were definitely many others there who ran much faster and better than I, younger and much older.  I envy those people.  I think running is wonderful, and I wish I was better at it.  It's so raw and natural and athletic, and gets you in wonderful shape.  To set out on a run is a spitiritual and athletic experience, and I enjoyed it.  I felt great afterwards.  After the run, Brandi and I met up with her friends from work and their kids at a GREAT little waterpark in North Richland Hills called NRH20.  Don't let it's size fool you; they have GREAT water slides, great wave pool, and even have a water roller coaster like the one at Schlitterbahn.  Fun was had by all.  The evening consisted of shopping at the wonderful Stonebriar Center and dinner at the lovely Cheesecake Factory.  Picked up 2 books at B&N that I'm itching to read:  Michael Moore's "Stupid White Men" and Emily Colas' "Just Checking: Scenes from the Life of an Obsessive-Compulsive."  Both look like terrific reads.  Yesterday we went to Old Navy and I got some good stuff, all for cheap.  Lots of sales.  Back to the grind of Monday.  Spanish this morning was great.  Today I had an intake that will prove to be one of my most difficult cases ever.  I don't know what to do and I haven't even started.  Client has an extraordinarily hard history, and clinician was very moved by client's story.  I need some supervision ASAP.  Sometimes I feel like MD's do more for their patients.  Their work is more tangible and immediate; our work is abstract and relative, and not even I understand it.  How is the common person supposed to???  I don't understand how assessments are that helpful.  When you go see a doctor and he says "our test results indicate you have cancer," he/she doesn't just say "good luck."  I feel like that's what we do...I just say yup, you were right, you've got depression...and that's where it ends.  Someone tell me how assessments are essential and how I can use them effectively for treatment that I can do.  Another intake at 6:00...  Kitten driving me crazy.  He drank my milk today and had his head in the ranch dressing.  I really have to control my anger with him because I could hurt him if I lost it.  He gets really annoying sometimes because he's so full of energy.  But he's so damn cute, too.  I wish he would just stop messing with stuff he shouldn't.  How will I manage kids of my own that do the same thing????

      So I'm kinda out of it today, because my sleep schedule got thrown off yesterday evening/night.  I laid down to take a "nap" at around 5:45 p.m. and didn't end waking up until around 10:15 p.m.  So of course I wasn't tired and ready for bed again until about 4:30 a.m., and then I woke up this morning at around 10:00 a.m.  Blah.    So I keep thinking about the programs I turned down to come here.  I found this: http://www.usd.edu/ctp/CurrentGradInfo/gradinfo.cfm  today, which is a picture (the top one) of who my colleagues would have been, had I decided to go to the University of South Dakota.  I've also been surfing around here again: http://humdev.uchicago.edu/mainpage1.htm  partly to continue torturing myself (masochist), and partly to see what's going on.  I got accepted to the University of Chicago and they offered me a $20,000 scholarship.  Of course, I wasn't accepted into their PhD program; I was accepted into this program: http://mapss.uchicago.edu/  However, I could have studied whatever I wanted to (cultural psychology, psychological anthropology, UChicago is a leading university in this area) and then applied again to the PhD program after getting my M.A.  If I didn't get in there, I would have been much more competitive for other clinical programs, given I would have a graduate degree from Chicago.  IT SUCKS because I KNOW that there are places out there much more suited for me given my research and clinical interests.  There are students at UCLA and Michigan right now working with the people and doing the things I want to, but I'm not there, I'm here.  How will I ever get over this feeling of being jipped.  People already think I'm nuts because I'm taking Spanish and anthropology classes.  Maybe that's just a red flag that I'm awkward here.  I'm in a very pessimistic mood right now, so bear with me kids.  People also think I'm nuts for being in school for so long.  If I really got to do what I want, I would get a PhD in clinical psychology, then go to the University of Chicago and do another PhD there in clinical ethnography.  They have a PhD program at UChicago but its not APA accredited and not a focus of the department.  I would need the PhD in clinical psychology so I can be licensed and be graduated from an APA accredited program.  That way, I could see clients in direct practice.  Going to Chicago would be while I worked as a clinical psychologist.  I would then start my graduate work studying the things that truly fascinate me: mental illness in cross-cultural and international perspective, culture and psychopathology, etc.  I'd still be young when I finish here, so it wouldn't be that bad, would it?  I'm insane.

      My client canceled.  My advisor forgot our appointment.  I hate when my schedule changes suddenly.  I've realized that I'm not good with change sometimes.  When I have a plan in my head, I want to stick with it, and when it suddenly changes, I fall apart.  I feel all "heady," (best way to describe it), and I don't know if I'm coming our going.  I feel all lost and like I'll get nothing done.  I need a plan.    It's still raining outside.  I don't care if this has typos.  I hope we have spanish tomorrow, or we're going to be really behind.  Today I was just all out of sorts.  Hope tomorrow is better! buenas noches everyone.

      So there I am doing great and at school this morning on time.  As I pull up to park, a police officer tells me that all morning classes at TCC-NW campus have been canceled, due to the storm last night.  Power was out or something.  Ugh. Classes resume at noon, but all morning classes were canceled.  All that driving for nothing.  It does give me time to do some more writing for Dr. J., but I would have rather had spanish class.  I was all ready for the quiz.  :( !buenos dias! More later...

      Spanish this morning was great! Traffic SUCKED down I35W...there I was, rolling along, preparing to be 15 minutes early to class (those of you who know me well understand this feat), when the traffic started to stack not 2 miles from my exit for highway 820.  I was 5 minutes late to class.  Luckily, la maestra had not started yet, and I was certainly not the last one to class.  I'll have to leave earlier tomorrow, yuk.  My class has about 25-30 people in it, and I'm taking it with all the people who are actually getting credit for the course (unlke me, who's taking it for continuing education only).  I found out that CE people only register for the lecture and I don't have to attend lab that is after lecture from 10:10-11:30am.  I can actually do the lab work at home, especially since I have a fast connection to watch the little movies required for the lab questions.  I could stay in the lab if I want to, but I've already counted on only being on campus from 8:00-10:00am, which is what my schedule says.  I need time for practicum and work, and I can do all the lab work at home.  The kids taking it for credit can't do this, since 50% of the lab grade is attendance and participation.  They will also be doing some oral practice and a few extra activities in there, but nothing I can't do on my own.  AND AND AND it doesn't matter, because I'm not taking the class for a grade! It's REALLY hard for me to comprehend that right now.  I'm going into obsessive must-get-A mode, even thought I'm NOT GETTING A GRADE and no course credit!   There are definitely some characters in there, though.  Several 18-somethings who complained about the work required for the class and traded war stories about how many classes they'd skipped and failed the previous year.  We had our first quiz TODAY on spanish color names...I got a 100.  She gave us 20 minutes to study the list.  Several people just put their heads down or left the room and didn't care.  I was busy repeating over and over  "morado, purple."  I'm probably one of the most serious students in there and I'm not even taking it for credit.  We have another quiz tomorrow and homework often.  It should be great, and even better once I get over myself and realize on this one, leftwingkid, you can relax, it's not for a grade.  In other news, AC has been successfully fixed, thanks to the good men and women at Ace.  Also, A, my computer had been working extremely slow because it had a potential virus and had tons of old stuff on it (illegally downloaded music from the Napster era, bunches of old files, etc,.) that were slowing it down.  Brandi's dad is a computer engineer, so I took the computer to him, and he reformatted the hard drive and reinstalled everything.  I saved all I needed on floppies and a zip disk.  The puter now works lightning fast.  It's been so long.

      Today I've been feeling the passion for clinical psychology again, and I am thankful.&nbsp; I daydream about one day writing things like this: &nbsp; Steven D. Gomez, Ph.D. Professor of Clinical Psychology &amp; Anthropology Some Amazing University City, State, Zip phone: fax: www: &nbsp; How wonderful! I know that I've fallen victim to negative energy in my program on numerous occasions.&nbsp; I've bitched my fair part, but something about the last time I heard bitching at school made me think differently.&nbsp; You know, when I was in D.C., I saw a line of homeless people, mostly African American, waiting for rations from a social service van parked outside, of all places, the World Bank.&nbsp; This looked identical to a scene of a documentary a dear friend showed in my Teaching of Psychology class about schizophrenia and the community impact.&nbsp; That image of seeing these homeless people, several obviously suffering from some kind of mental illness (we saw a man laughing and talking out loud to himself in front of the Capitol Building, too) struck me and is engrained in my brain.&nbsp; How lucky I am.&nbsp; For shame that I bitch and moan and complain about my training, funding, classes, etc.&nbsp; How dare I.&nbsp; This is what I wanted, and I knew what I was getting myself into when I signed up for this.&nbsp; I knew I wasn't going to get a tuition waiver.&nbsp; I knew funding would be less than ideal.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can do one of two things: 1) I can bitch and moan and feed into negative energy and not enjoy my time in graduate school, or 2) I can make the best of everything, count my blessings, thank the gods and spirits, recognize things that aren't fair and work to make the best of these situations, and enjoy the good things about my training.&nbsp; It's isn't like UNT is the most fucked up place&nbsp;on earth, and when we work in the professional world, things will suddently be perfect.&nbsp; I'm meeting lifelong friends here.&nbsp;When I'm done, I'll be a Ph.D. clinical psychologist.&nbsp; I have an exceptional mentor who is there for me even when she's far away.&nbsp; I need to shutup, suck it up, quit spending my time whining and complaining, and get busy with my training.&nbsp; I spent some time reading today for my thesis and got the spark of excitement again.&nbsp; I read and read that there is a substantial body of research MISSING from psychopathology and mental health research dealing with ethnic minorities and culture.&nbsp; That's what I want to do.&nbsp; It makes so much sense, I just need to get busy.&nbsp; I was reading about Expressed Emotion (EE) research in schizophrenia with Mexican Americans, and differences observed in that group, better treatment outcomes in that group, and cultural factors proposed to explain those differences that need MORE research done on them.&nbsp; A, whenever you want to collaborate on a SCZ study, just say the word! :) &nbsp; So I'm home for the weekend and it's always good to remember my roots.&nbsp; My parents certainly wouldn't appreciate me going to school just to bitch and moan.&nbsp; They didn't get that chance.&nbsp; There's so many things I want to do with my career and bitching and moaning won't help to accomplish my goals.&nbsp; I remember why I'm studying spanish language, taking ANTH, etc., and I get excited again.&nbsp; My mom and I were talking last night and she was telling me that when she was in school, they were punished for speaking spanish.&nbsp; The principal would hear people secretly speaking spanish in the halls and yell "I heard that," and if you were caught, you were punished in the typical public school fashion of referrals, detention, etc.&nbsp; Can you believe that? It makes me horribly angry.&nbsp; Fuck the system of the 1960s.&nbsp;  &nbsp; So I'm feeling inspired, thankful, and like spreading love,&nbsp;and I hope this lasts.&nbsp; I'm thankful that graduate school has given me the opportunity to grow, push my limits, and make some wonderful friends along the way; the kind of friends I've been waiting for my whole life.&nbsp; Thanks!

      Girl: Do I smell? Me: No, why? Girl: Because you laughed when she (the guest speaker) said "urine." (guest speaker asked us if we had ever been around someone sho smelled like urine as she was trying to make a point about the endocrine system)  Girl: One time, I threw up while I was sleeping.  I almost choked to death.  When I woke up, the throw up looked like it had parasites in it. Me: Gross (guest speaker was pushing her agenda about parasites, the iris, and pets)  This is what I'm up against people.  These are two actual conversations I had with some girl I don't know who sits next to me in ANTH. I call her "Frankie" after MTV's Real World San Diego Frankie.  She looks kinda like her with her dress and style.  I don't care to know her real name.  We had a guest speaker come in today and talk about Iridology, which is the art/science of reading the iris and telling what is wrong with you health wise and where it is in your body.  This girl next to me got all upset and worried when the lady said that you shouldn't sleep with your animals because they will infest you with parasites that travel through the anus.  Apparently she is the only one who can heal you.  She gave us her phone number and address and told the anxiety-ridden girl next to me to call her.  Yuk.  So I'm reminded each day that many people walking on earth posing as normals are really nuts.  This girl walked into spanish today and from the moment she made a noise I knew she was fucking histrionic.  She laughed out loud way too much once when the prof said something in spanish that the rest of us didnt know (apparently she knows spanish well).  Funny thing is, when she went up to the board as a volunteer during class, she didnt know an answer and instead of leaving it blank, drew this instead:  :p that's right, a happy face with a tongue sticking out instead of the answer.  People amaze me in how nutty they are, how self-involved, how narcissistic, and how vein.  My new spanish prof is okay, but much more of a drill sergeant than our last teacher.  She's way strict with the rules and demands that we participate, like says "get up, come on, go to the board" when she wants volunteers.  She's great, she's studied in Mexico and Spain, she's struggled with spanish herself, so I'm sure she'll be great, just kind of cold so far.  I'm so behind in my clinic work and my friend C is having a get together tonight.  I don't think I'll stay too long, maybe just long enough to eat something.  I have class at 800am tomorrow, and a client who will drain me I'm sure.  I'm at work now and should probably be doing work-things.  More later, fan.

      So it's been awhile since I blogged, but now I have some time to catch the world up on my happenings, as if the world is reading....  So I recently got back from a trip to Washington, D.C.  I miss it already something awful (I love that expression!).  The city is wonderful.  Our friends are wonderful, and we had an amazing time.  It sucks that we don't live closer and don't get to see each other more often.  My friend L is one of those that gets it, and we totally have so much fun together.  Her fiance, A, is a great guy, too, and we had a blast and I'm glad we got to know each other better.  They are lifelong friends.  So anyway, D.C. is an amazing city, especially for us nerds.  We got to do tons of walking and ride the subway.  Museums, memorials, historic sites, history bleeds from the city.  The city is vibrant, alive, rich with cultural traditions, and overflowing with the world's people.  As I've said recently, it was just great to be able to stand on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial and be surrounded by people speaking a million different languages, wearing many different types of clothes and dress, and from tons of different cultural backgrounds.  This is my America, I thought.  I reflected a lot while in D.C.  We walked through L's undergrad school, The George Washington University, and I daydreamed about going to grad school in a vibrant large urban city with so much to offer.  We saw all the popular memorials, Natural History Museum, Holocaust Mueseum (which was absolutely amazing), Arlington National Cemetery complete with JFK's grave and the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier/Changing of the Guard, Mount Vernon, Ford's Theater, and much more.  For close friends, I'll be sending you the link to the pics online soon.  Girl and I had a great time and are planning our next trip out there, when we go to L&A's wedding at the end of May.  D.C. is rich with politics, debate, and the issues, and I love it.  D.C., you are sorely missed.  Back to reality.  So this week we've had some guest speakers come into my Holistic Health & Alternative Healing course.  Yesterday we had a witch (who practices Wicca).  She told us that when we misplace our keys at home and swear we left them one place but find them other places, that's the fairies and elves who take our keys.  She leaves things out for them in her home so they don't play tricks on her.  She says Leprochauns are the keepers of knowledge. She says when she graduated from college she was really overweight, decided to lose weight, got a stone that promotes weight loss, and then a year later she lost a ton of weight.  At that moment I wanted to raise my hand and ask her if she also changed her diet and excercised, or if it was just the stone, but I didn't want to be "that guy" who looks like a dick in class.  Someone did ask her, though, what about the stone made her lose weight, and she said "it's healing properties."  So, it heals because it has healing properties.  That's fuzzy logic.  But really, I did wholeheartedly agree with many of the things she said about respecting and worshiping the earth, respecting other views, not trying to convert others, believing life is both male and female, etc., but a lot of other stuff just sounded like fairy tales and bullshit.  It's funny, I say I'm so open-minded to others but I found it hard not to be cynical during the presentations.  I found myself becoming more conservative as far as my views about this stuff.  I guess it's good to be challenged, and after the course is done I'm sure I'll know more about myself and where I stand re: these complementary and alternative medicines.  Today's presentation was a white guy who practices Native American healing and shamanistic counseling.  He had a lot of insightful and great things to say, but he basically bashed the entire Western medical system, including mental health.  He was pushing an agenda.  He said if he can't fix your problem in 6 sessions, he stops seeing you.  He said he is not a therapist who has you sit on their couch and you charge them 150.00 a session and you lie on a couch and talk about your problems over many many sessions over years.  He says that's unhealthy dependence.  This guy borrows from different Native American traditions and is thus eclectic in his approach.  He has a lodge here in Denton where they do NA healing.  Who knew?  When I got into class today, 10 minutes late of course so I was frazzled, he was burning some stinky incense.  He said he got into this work after being a high school teacher and not enjoying it.  Escaping into this reality must have been a welcome change for him....you know, I find myself "conceptualizing" people a lot now...I try to figure them out.  That's probably bad.  Anyways, there are aspects of these people's beliefs that I love and there are some I think are just plain stupid.  I also realize that Christianity, etc. has a lot of "out there" beliefs.  I think I just need to spend more time with these things and bat them around in my head.  Maybe they're totally right and we've all got it wrong.  The NA guy said that all illness stems from us being unbalanced.  I have a hard time believing that EVERY kind of disease, cancer, etc. comes from improper balance.  You can't deny the advances modern medicine has brought us and how many lives it has saved.  If I get the flu, I'm not spreading lavender on my face, you know? I'm going to the fucking western doctor.  So I'm stressing about opening my big mouth to a dear friend and telling her what nasty and rude things other friends have said about her.  I first feel like I've betrayed M for not standing up for her at the time of incident.  I then feel like I've betrayed friends like J and S because I went "behind their backs" and told M, per her request, what they said about her.  I don't want to start anything.  But I feel I need to tell J and S that I told M what they said about her, but I don't want to tell them.  I'm tired of being in these situations where I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place.  So tomorrow starts Spanish II and my schedule just gets busier.  But I'm glad to be taking spanish, as always.  Today a couple came in for couples therapy and both husband and wife are spanish speakers, husband bilingual but wife spanish only.  They were looking around for a student clinician to take the case.  It hurts me to the core that they can't look to me to take the case, beside the fact that I can't do therapy yet.  I want to speak spanish and I want the spanish speaking clients, dammit.  I'm fucking Mexican.  It only makes sense.....right?  So this week, though busy, has been good.  I've reconnected with some friends and realize how important it is to just pick up the fucking phone or shoot a fucking email to a friend you've lost contact with for a while.  We all die, and we should live life with the richness of friends.  We all get busy and we all wait for the other to call us, but don't wait.  Reconnect.  I have also realized the power of getting over it, by it I mean anything that another has done to piss you off or something that has happened to you that made you mad.  Life is short as it is, dont live it angry.  It feels so great to proclaim "I'm so over it." I wish I could learn to do that more often.  Today I had a really great intake with a fun new client who will be a pleasure to help.  I will be getting another client soon too, this one a kid.  Kids are great, and this should also be a blast.  I got to thinking today what a great position I am in in my life.  People come to me and open their minds hearts and arms to me and say "help me."  They trust me and they come to me with problems they can't handle on their own.  How wonderful a profession this is.  I get to meet amazing people from all walks of the world.  I get to help them when they need it most and when they trust me.  I want to be an exceptional healer and I want to incorporate some of the alternative methods into my modern work.  I want to bring people into balance and at the same time talk about strategies to deal with social anxiety.  People want me to help them, and I am grateful.  I'm winding down and have a long day tomorrow.  Happy Blogging.

      So today is the 4th of July and I forgot what we're supposed to be celebrating.  I remember when I was a kid that the 4th was a lot of fun.  Now that I have the *gift* of knowledge, the 4th makes me think too much to really blindly enjoy it like many others do.  Sometimes I find myself getting really angry thinking about our world.  I don't know of that's a good thing or not.  Did the most influential people in or country also feel such passion over things? Was this not a good thing? I don't know.  Sometimes I find it extremely difficult to relax and have a good time in a fairly large group of people.  woah, random.  Something happened this weekend that reminded me that I have body image issues.  You know how one thing can trigger you and affect you tremendously in a negative way?  I hate that.  When such things happen (I know I'm being vague), emotions pour through me and I can't stop them.  They take over.  I used to be chubby chubby during middle school and for a little of high school.  People used to make fun of me.  I think these experiences have shaped who I am today.  Nothing's ever good enough.  I want perfection.  My body looks different to me on different days.  Sigh.  I am reminded how emotions are so powerful that they can consume the person and transform them for the rest of the day.  What I'm writing makes half sense.  I feel overwhelmed with work and understimulated with my work, which is a lousy feeling.  I'm tired of jumping through hoops to satisfy requirements so that I can do what I want in the future, maybe.  Sometimes I think clinical isn't for me.  And let there be typos.
