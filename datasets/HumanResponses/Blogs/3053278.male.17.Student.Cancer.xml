        MY PRINCIPLES OF LEADERSHIP    "Always do everything you ask of those you command."  -Gen. George S. Patton   "Faith in the ability of a leader is of slight service unless it be united with faith in his justice." -George Goethals  "We should be taught not to wait for inspiration to start a thing. Action always generates inspiration. Inspiration seldom generates action." -Frank Tibolt  "No man is wise enough by himself." -Titus Maccius Plautus    That last quote reminds me that I have total respect for the other six captains and to achieve the goals we will need to be like one team. They will be my true companions in a time where my ideas of leadership are lost and hopefully they will allow me to do the same for them.

      "Battle is the most magnificent competition in which a human being can indulge. It brings out all that is best; it removes all that is base. All men are afraid in battle. The coward is the one who lets his fear overcome his sense of duty. Duty is the essence of manhood."  -Gen George S. Patton

      One thing I forgot to mention about last night was that in the new cafeteria (we practice in the old cafeteria) there was the Haitian flag day celebration so they were having a party. This of course served a problem because we store all of our stuff in the new cafeteria. As I was walking to and from carrying stuff to use, I walked past Chris. Chris was there with his girlfriend. I see no problem about him hanging out with his girl. But I know that time he spends with his other friends could be sometimes better spent helping his team. There is no burden put on him by becoming captain. It's just I feel like now maybe there could have been others who would fit his job better. What am I saying... He's team leader for a reason and he has to learn how to lead. I just have to help him because like the others he's never seen us lose.

      The Mens team is fucked...I fenced today at the NJFA. Tuesday's are always slow in sabre so I fenced epee to work on my footwork, you know, try to strengthen my legs. I fenced Matt Lee and Alex Delaney. From what Martha has told me Matt sucks. Sorry, I don't think Martha would say he sucked, she'd say he wasn't very good. Anyway I fenced him and won 5-2. Now from what I remember, he fenced at PWF for some time and the way they fence epee...He should be nasty. Alex Delaney, I lost but the score was 5-4, I mean I know when you fence sucky people you seem to fence weird but they were just slow and they hesitated to often. It scares me because he's supposed to be our C-strip next year. I plan on fencing epee more often so I can get those fencers faster and more agile. Maybe if can convince them to go through some sabre work with me and my squad.   I think I'm going to buckle down and try to get my team to work harder, well at least my squad. The girls don't need it. I think they will still be ranked no1. Not initially but I know they will be hard to beat. With the most experienced epee squad,the best foilist and definitely the best sabreur. I don't think that boys realize that they really have to work for it. I've told them and the others that one of the problems that we have is that,well, the sophomores have never seen the team lose a dual meet. I've seen it plenty of times. Idris has seen it. But this was back when we were freshman and we didn't care for the team that much. Now I love the team and we will, I repeat, WILL go back to the State Final, even if I have to carry that team all the way up the hill on my back in the rain and sleet. We WILL go back...Even if I have to sacrifice my chances of going to individuals. We will do it-------6:2:1

      I HATE FUCKING BENIDICTS THEY CAN FUCKING EAT COLUMBIA'S SOCKS  They have all of their fencers  at PWF. It is fucked up. Well not all of their fencers, just about 8 of them. They think that they can get their fencers to go than that's ok.We'll just have to prove ourselves some other way. My team doesn't seem to care sometimes. Their are also rumors that Davidson might not fence for Benedicts anymore. That would be so great. All I have to do is get past Tracey and the rest of the A Strips(kopylov,Conley,Chu,Hammond,etc.). It kills me sometimes when I know it's my last year and I haven't made a name for myself. Mason said I'd be a household name.I don't wanna be like Tambor or Rivella. I don't want to get in to the spotlight and then lose the big bout or get injured halfway through the season. I want to accomplish my dream. I want to be captain of the first Columbia team to win 3 state championships in a row. I want to graduate from Columbia with that ring on my finger. I want the Coaches to watch me fence and offer slots on their college teams. I want Pete and Mustilli to help me get into any school.ugh there's so many things I need to accomplish with my fencing.

      I get random urges to just stop walking and start advancing or pick up a blade and hit a target or something. Or I'm in class and I wish that I was in the city fencing at PWF. It's like I can't go a day without picking up my blade. I mean these are kind the fencing chronicles so what else am I going to talk about.

      who's nasty? I said who's nasty? I AM mother-fucker. did i beat some ass yesterday(no that doesn't mean i got any). I fenced in the city yesterday. Pete seemed pretty happy to see me and i hadn't been in awhile so was good to fence at that caliber. I mean i fence meredith and Jason at NJFA and i don't seem to be as motivated. The other day i faced them in a team sabre match. My team lost(Matt and Harrison fenced really well)but I still went 3-0 beating mer 5-0 and jason 5-3. Mer thinks i just got better but intruth ive always seemed to take it easy on her, and jason, well he just get's upset when i beat him, same with rob. Truth is i beleive at times im better. I want the success more, not to sound cocky. I get insulted when i beat jason and he goes "I'm fencing like crap." It's marrissa and nicole who alway make my day. When they fence me, win or lose they compliment and encourage me.   But back to what i was originally saying. I went to Foundation and i kicked some ass. I saw Ibti there and she was happy to hear i made captain. I dominated in my first bout but my big bout was the second. I fenced Kianati(not sure if the spelling is right) he is one nasty fencer. We always seem to have fun when we fence and i've become much closer to him than i have the others(even davidson). i won this time, I think he won the last time though. My third bout was a mess...I fenced davidson again. i lost 5-0 i beat him last week,ugh. But that wasn't what really upset me. there's this one fencer who's really good...short but really quick. Acouple weeks back I told Pete when i saw him in the city that my team had won the state cahmpionship. He mentioned it during one of my bouts(big mistake).That one kid took it to tounge. Everytime i fenced he would talk "some state champion you are." It really got me when i fenced ross, since i lost so badly. I was pleased with the way I held my temper in. In a way I'm happy I lost because it gave the kid the courage to challenge me. I don't remember the score but i won. I earned his respect. I seemed to earn everyon's respect. All ready had Kianati's respect though. I guess skill and talent equal respect.

      I was out with some of my friends and the topic of school sports  came in to the conversation. One of my friends asked me if I had wanted to be captain. This thought stirred some serious thought, we had a half hour before the movie started and I explained," Everyone wants to be captain of their team. This comes following thought that the captains are the best athletes on the team." I explained to him that wasn't the reason I was chosen to be a captain. I did my best to show them that in times of struggle,loss of focus and direction. I could be the one to step up and hold the responsibilities of being a leader(At this point everyone at the table was listening). I told them that when I was a freshman, I could care less about the team. I was in it for nothing relevant, just to do something. My sophomore year. All I was thinking about was myself. Trying to be the best and doing well without caring who I was stepping on or pushing out of the way. I realized what I was doing and decided that the team was going to need a leader in 2005. My Sensei had reminded me that I was a born leader and I should always take advantage when there is part of my life that is without leadership. It was my duty as a true warrior to step forward and expose myself as a potential leader. I could have easily blended in and pretended like I didn't exist. I chose to take leadership where it was needed. Now I have taken the time out of my life to lead this team and gain knowledge along the path. We  WILL  go back to that state final...Even if it kills me....

      Have to get the roster from Mer today and to make sure she's coming on saturday. Martha's not coming but I really think that the way they fence over there would really help her in the long run...I know has for me.

      Where do I begin...Fenced well yesterday. Well considering I fenced shona and Ben, two beginner fencers. I don't feel like anything when I fence them but it still makes me happy when I know that if I'm not getting anything out of it maybe they are. I still wish that Mer and Jason would come on Tuesdays. Well actually I really just wish it was mer. No that's not what I meant(If you know about the team you know that  Mer and Jason are an item).I actually just have a certain dislike for Jason,the only real like I have for him comes out of respect for his leadership.  After easily going through the sabre fencers I fenced some epee. Beat up on James and matt and then fenced one last person. Martha. Enough said. No not really she claims i only got one touch and told her two but I have a pretty good memory and the score was for sure 5-3. I HATE Her. Nay just playin', I love Martha. Happy to have her as a friend and fellow captain. One thing that does worry me though is whether or not I'm going get the girls to stand behind the guys. I remember last year the boys were all ways behind the girls even during the state tourn. The girls didn't seem to show the same support for the guys. Hopefully we can change this next year.

      o boy,just what i was hoping for in goal. A tourny. George says that Bernards Jared Hammond will be there. Marcus is sure that I can beat him and I might actually end up on the fencers to watch list in the fall. Ending up on the list really isn't one of my goals but it would be nice. Meredith will of course be on there(I pronised her if she wasn't number 1...i would beat up the star ledger writers.

      Washed Cars today...Oh yeah and I took my SAT's. Quite fun lol. I took it at Barringer High in Newark. I didn't expect much from the school. The metal detector caught many of the Columbia students off guard. After the test, which by the way I felt I did well being I didn't study much. I def broke 1100 which is great considering I studied like two days. Next time in October I plan to break 1300 but that's far away so let's get back to the car wash. I washed cars, held signs, shook money cans, and it was brought to my attention that I was the lead captain during the most successful car wash we've ever had. This is really only because I had to control some people who having more fun than washing cars. Hitting eachother with soapy sponges and soaking others with the hoses. At this point the cars started piling up due to the loss of work. At one point we had 11 cars lined up and they were still playing around. I'm one for jokes, many know that but I remember it's work before play. I might crack jokes but they relate mostly to what I'm doing and if something needs to be done I'm going to do it and then have some fun. I was surprised at Martha. She seemed a little too caught up in the fun and of course when I asked her to stop she got me with the sponge. May be she was under the influence of Alex... Or maybe I'm just giving Alex too much credit. Of course my method-Work first play later came into affect when it was over. Oh yeah Martha got it. She was literally soaked(She was wearing a white shirt...DAMN that girl is sexy).  I watched the Belmont Stakes not long ago and Smarty Jones was predicted to win the Triple Crown and become a legend. But he was upset by a new guy...Someone that no body had heard of. Someone who had run the race before. Birdstone. I'm going to remember how he did it. I feel like I'm in the same position with Moorestown and Tracey. I'm going upset everyone. I'm going to take them all by surprise. I'm going to push my self to no end to succeed. Those guys are going to hate me for how hard I'm going to push them. They will want to stop and want to quit but they will respect me for how hard I push them. They'll thank me later. I like to compare competition to battle so therefore my thought is parallel to this quote-  "Battle is the most magnificent competition in which a human being can indulge. It brings out all that is best; it removes all that is base. All men are afraid in battle. The coward is the one who lets his fear overcome his sense of duty. Duty is the essence of manhood."                  -General George S. Patton

      my computer has been quite strange and because of it I have had trouble posting...I had an ok day  on thursday, except for the fact that I lost to meredith. What was frustrating about the bout was not the fact that I didn't fence well but the fact the eqipment was giving trouble and mer go touches she really shouldn't have. But w/e it's one bout and i'll just from now on have to fence 100% all the time(well actually due to my injuries im fencing about 70%). But I got SAT's tommorow and then the Car Wash. The Wash will release my SAT tension so until then.  I found out about my worst injury.. You may not know this already but i have a pretty high pain tolerance...I pulled my gracilis tendon in the back of my leg and it makes it difficult to lunge and run. It's healing and Vanessa says it will be fine in due time. so good luck to my leg.

      My inability to understand Jason's obvious loss of respect for me makes me assume he just generally dislikes me. I try my hardest to not hate him. Hate is a strong word for me. And I realize the bigger picture here, That it all goes back to some point where I misunderstood his personality. Misunderstanding leads to fear, fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, and of course hate leads to my inevitable suffering. This theory and all subjects surrounding it can be found in the studies of ninjitsu and the art of the Warrior. Maybe soon I'll understand him and maybe I'll grow to like him. This seems hard to achieve due to my last encounter. I ran into Jason and Rob on the train the other day. Not sure what they were doing coming from Hoboken but They asked what I was doing. I told them that I had just come from the city from PWF and they both asked what I was doing in Hoboken. I explained that I took the path here and was now going home from Hoboken. They wondered why I didn't just take the midtown direct. I explained that my route was cheaper plus I could use my dad's Hoboken pass so all I had to pay for was was the path. Rob gave me one of those, oh I get it looks but Jason...He gave a look that should have come with "Why is Greg so stupid?" He shook his head and walked in the next train car. He has to be likeable in some way. Meredith sees something in him obviously. She likes him enough to go out with him and Rob 's his best friend so he has to have some qualities that are truly likeable. We'll see in the long run.

      There were about 6 sabre fencers, I tied for 3rd with Hammond. The credible fencers were Koplylov(1st), Kovacs(2nd), and Hammond(3rdT). I lost to Kovacs in the Finals... He was a older guy say little older than my parents. One thing about him though was he was smart. Real smart. He beat in the pool also(he beat Hammond too). His technique was awesome and he gave Kopylov a run for his money. I fenced Hammond in the pools. I wanted to fence him so badly that I didn't unleash on him. I lost 5-3 but had a 2-0 lead. I feel kind of eck about it. My first touch I caught him off guard and slashed him right across the chest. Then the next touch my break failed and I caught in the nicest prep. I should have won that bout...But w/e I'll see him next week at the Lilov father's day tournament and then at the Garden State Games. I gonna get mine.

      It's all set...Got the lame working from rob..Stole mask from Harrison.. I'll thank him later. O boy...It's coming. I looked at the past couple weeks and like my finals I didn't prepare very well, but then again I started preparing for finals about two weeks ago and I've been preparing for this tournament for months now. I hope Hammond is there...Win or lose I have to show myself something..Fill that emptiness. I feel like I've worked harder than every guy on that team, but never really got the payoff. I once said to Marcus, "Your a perfectionist whether or not you want to admit it." He Responded, "And you just want to be the best there is whether or not you want to admit it." I need to fill that hole in me...Whether it's fencing or something else... I have to find it, I have to find my plug.

I don't have a good lame or mask. The mask i can get...it's the lame' worried about. I might be able to get one. I think i'm a XL maybe marcus has a old one...yes he does! ok all i need to do is get intouch with a senior on his last day of high school(o boy). let's just hope for the best

Let's see how it helps. I also have a strange feeling about Lilov on Saturday.

      I was unable to fence yesterday...But I showed up for a couple of minutes and I spotted some new faces. Ones with Pingry uniforms. I really don't like the fact that other schools are using are club but there's nothing I can do about it. At least there foil fencers. Because I only stayed for like 5 minutes... I didn't get a chance to tell everyone about lilov...hopefully I will on Thursday.

      I got some gel soles for my fencing shoes...This should stop the blistering and the heel burns. Mr. Koplylov asked me to come to the Lilov tournament next weekend. Problem is that is also my great uncles 80th birthday. I hope the tournament is going according to schedule so I can leave in time for the party.  My second thing is getting other people out there at lilov. The prom excuse won't work this time so hopefully everyone will be ready to compete on Saturday. I know Idris can't make it but hopefully I'll get Mer out there on the sabre side. I really want the boy's foil and epee squad to compete. They need it. I need to do something with Sam. I feel like I owe him some type of training. I also need to send letters out to the boys team to advertise the club. The summer is less important to me but the truth is that in the Fall, I won't take no for an answer.

      I haven't figured out what the dream means but I have found some events that match. Ok the Pedro Martinez one came early this morning when jay reluctantly told me that the minor league team he was gonna play for was owned by the Red Sox and Jay knew I hated them so he didn't tell me? Maybe  I talked to Amanda today who is now in college and I don't know what type of connection that has with the dream.  Now the reason I posted this dream n the first place was b/c Mer was in it. She was unable to pull me off Pedro b/c she hurt herself...Turns out that Mer fractured her finger and can't fence for 2 weeks. There's still more to this connection I need to figure out... Especially the part with Em...Oh well  One thing that has happened recently is the feeling in my right pinky is bothering me. It's lasted for a couple days now and I don't know what to do. Sometimes it's a little numb but I have to deal with it.

      I had the strangest dream... I've actually been having a lot of strange dreams lately. Well this all I can put together: _I was at some kind of lecture or a class with Columbia students. _We were sitting in some sorts of groups _I was with my history class and in all of my other dreams(and in real life) Amanda was sitting next to me _strange enough the seats were changed around a bit  _I was still sitting next to Amanda but now on my right was Emily(long story) _Somebody was playing Footsy with me and I thought it was Em  _I looked over at Emily and then looked back _I wasn't Em anymore it was Pedro Martinez! _That's right Boston Red Sox Pitcher Pedro Martinez _Now next thing I know I'm beatin the crap out of him _Mer is trying to pull me off him but she can't cause she's hurt herself _And the dream breaks apart   I haven't figured it all out but hopefully it will all come together around the people of my dream.

      My mother told me that people on her side of the family have this thing for precognative dreams, seems I have it too.  There is a topic I wanted to adress but the only reason is that it's related to one of my dreams. About 3 weeks back I was awoken by a dream...well now it seems like a nightmare. I was at a fencing meet and everything was going well,it seemed we were winning and who we were fencing wasn't important. All of the sudden I noticed that I was getting ready to fence. This is where I did something I had never done before. I had just been hooked up and I was bending over to tie a black piece of cloth around my leg. This scared me because I would only do this if I was honoring someone I had lost. What was really strange was that marcus was there cheering me on and in uniform so it couldn't be next year. I was confused and I started fencing and then woke up. Thinking about it later I realized that I was the only one wearing the cloth so it must have been someone close to me.  About a week and half later, I got the scare of my life. My grandmother(father's side) was diagnosed with cancer. The dream I'm afraid might have a connection. I hope she fully recovers and the dream was just a warning not a prediction. The surgery she went thru was seemingly successful and we don't get the results until at least monday so I hope for the best.

      I'm just gonna tell the story. I was sittin at home watchin old all-star games on espn classic and I got like 4 prank phone calls. I thought it was one of my sister's friends just goofin off but I noticed that a couple times I recognized the numbers. It's not like Lauren Monroe to send prank calls. The next came in and it was her so I picked up really quickly to listen to Lauren in tears. I wasn't sure of what to say but she explained that her boyfriend Kenyon had yelled at her for goin to the movies with jay on Friday. He called her a couple names which I dare not say. But It really didn't get started until she called jay. jay who just as close to her as I am flipped out and went looking for the SOB. My thought was that Jay shouldn't have gotten that angry and that's why Lauren called. She didn't want jay to go after him. I called the guys together so we could find jay and stop him before he did something stupid. Me,Mike and Nick went looking for jay we tried to call his cell, used the GPS thing his dad but on the Bentley hoping to find him. We went all over West Orange and couldn't find him. I was running through Essex Green Square when Lauren called mike and told him that Kenyon was back at her house tryin to apologize. We had never driven so fast before, as we were turning onto her street a silver Mercedes cut us off and we knew almost immediately it was jay. Jay jumped out his car and ran into the house. We pulled up and we could hear Lauren screaming STOP at the top of her lungs. I was the first in the house and the first thing I did was take jay by the arms and hold him back. That put everything on hold and it seemed like the problem was about to end but I was wrong. Kenyon reached over and hit jay in the face while I was holdin him. Lauren was mad about this and slapped Kenyon across the  face saying get out. This is where it got bad. Kenyon pushed Lauren to the ground and my temper took over. It's like a blur when I think of it now but I jumped forward and Kenyon ended up against the wall and I literally watched his face swell up as I kept stinging his head with my fists. Eventually the guys pulled me off and Kenyon ran out and drove home. Everyone came to my house and Lauren thanked me by helping me ice my hands. That's an experience I might never forget and one I might come to regret.

      O I love it, I love them. I can't seem to get enough of them. Spending time with them is something I just love to do. I can't get enough of their smiles. I don't know what to do about it I just love kids. On a Friday night some guys may ask me to go to the movies or to a party and I say "I'm working." Even If a girl asks me I try to push it to Saturday night so it's not in the way. I say I'm working but I it's not like work. It's like enjoying the company of these sweet kids. They make me feel better after a long day. I need kids. I don't know how to juggle teaching and fencing, I thought about other jobs but I love those kids too much. But then again missing the beginning of fencing hasn't been that bad sue to the fact that mer isn't there. She supposed to be there on Tuesday but the thing is I don't think she knows about the whole 5$ thing. I'll have to figure something out with the Kids. One of the greatest feelings is walking down the street and a student stops and waives at me yelling, "Hi Sensei Greg." I smile back and they walk along with their parent. My Sensei reminded me that they all look up to me and some wish to be me. Even Omar, He started after me and is a first degree. It feels weird calling him Sensei Omar but it makes feel good to know I helped him get there, Oh and I can't forget out of all of my students. The elite. The Jr. Blackbelts, My apprentice, the one I took under my wing is in fact the most feared 11 year old fighter in the nation. He's a beast. I don't know how much I'm going to miss it when I leave but hey it will always be here.

      I don't know if Idris is back from camp or not but mustilli is gonna get mad if he doesn't see him. As long as he gets out there and gets his tournament experience. My birthday, got to spend it fencing. I fenced with Ibti, Sam and Leslie. I'm happy to see Sam fencing again, I got to remember to thank Leslie for that. How I love her, Something about Leslie that really turns me on. Sorry to go off topic. I have to get everyone tournament ready, the team has the skill to go all the way but they need the experience to be confident and the only way to do that is through tournament play.

      u know im just realizing that tommorow is my birthday and im still trying to piece together this god damn team. And I'll never get my classification cause Inever get more than 10 guys at a tournement. And I have to get to Tracey. He's the only person I really want. I have to have my shot at him. It seems to me the only real fencers standing in my way are&nbsp;Hammond and Kopylov, I know there weakpoints, I just need to be in the right state of mind to fence them. I know many of there faults.&nbsp;I'm trying to track down the list of top rated fencers who are still in high school I will find them all and beat them, get myself on that list.

      Garden State Games was today...  Everyone fenced well, at least those who showed up. Kirsten took&nbsp;6th only cause she had to fence abby in the top 8. I believe abby won it(I didn't stay long enough) . No boys foil showed but Quincy fenced and took fifth, I believe he got his E.&nbsp; John Karatheodoris was there. Surprising the crap out of me. He fenced very well. There were 10 H.S. Boys sabre fencers, only 8 would qualify for DE's so they split us up into 2 pools. I had the hard pool. well all the known fencers. Igor got all the fencers that nobody had ever seen before. I was with Hammond, salzman,Camilleri and John. I beat everyone except Hammond. This was my toughest bout but w/e. Sweet Revenge. Luigi Camilleri, I have a trophy from my sophmore year when I went to Frosh/Soph tourn...5th place I should have gone to the top 4 but Someone stood in my way,&nbsp; Luigi Camilleri, at the time he&nbsp;was a better fencer than I was and I trained and&nbsp;said the next time we fenced I would take it to him.&nbsp; I won against him&nbsp; and then I stomped on Salzman and then came John. That was the longest bout cause we knew eachother's moves so it lasted kind long. I was happy for john cause he beat luigi and salzman. I then had to face john again in DE I won and had to move on to Jared. This is where I shut down. I was being beaten 8-1 at the break and rob made me realize that I was a better fencer I just had to finish my attack and lose my own. I made a comeback and made it 7-11. The final score was10-15, I lost but I was satisfied considering I know I could have won and we'll meet again. I can't wait to fence Kopylov again. I definitely figured out how to fence him. I have this new&nbsp;motivation now that I know I can compete with the toughest in the state.

      Fenced on wednsday(not today). We had to relocate the club to St. Josephs private school because the Adult school won't let us practice in Columbia. At the beginning of practice we started jogging and Ipti shot her mouth off so we had to run for for a bout 25 minutes which came out to about 2 1/2 miles. I spent most of the run trying to motivate Alex D. to keep running. I know with his size how hard it is to go through that. I kept pushing him and he kept running, I mean A'sha was a lot harder to motivate but I was very proud of him.

      I don't know why I'm doing this, this blog is supposed to be just for things related to fencing but I need somewhere to write down my most vivid dreams. I predict events in my life and I honestly don't know how to explain them sometimes. All I can piece together is I was in my living room and my father was int he next room. I had my arm around this girl, I kissed her and her lips were like keisha's. We made out for a bit and then I remember being out with my uncle gary and we had guns. Yes very strange,Then I was falling with a sabre in my hand...It didn't make any sense. Then I was going through this metal detector and the next thing I know it was going off and they didn't arrest me or anything they just said I needed my case to get on. I can't think of any type of public transportation that has metal detectors but then allows us to carry guns on board but w/e. It was strange cause I was fencing someone while falling and then I saw glimpses of the mustilli shrine. Then I saw Idris and then It was like he was afraid to say something to me. WTF I don't know why im writing this.

      saturday i fenced mildly with leslie and then I came home to change for the bbq. I showed up at the mustilli's expecting to see a whole bunch of fencer's. I said hey to mr. mustilli and then I noticed Jason and Charles at a lawn table and marissa swimming in the pool. Nicole was sitting under a mosquito net writing a paper, almost immediatley my heart sank but i didn't feel to bad when I saw jason going through his black book trying to contact fencers. John and Martha showed up and then marissa and jason went to the store. After they returned Alec and Leslie showed up and we all just enjoyed ourselves. We cooked some burgers and hot dogs and then we goofed around in mustilli's garage. The shrine is just an awesome place to be, so inspiring. I left and then I hung wit julian for the rest of the day
