      Hi, my name is Rob, and I'm an alcoholic.  Let's see -- I'm 23; I got sober when I was 21.  I actually got sober at a treatment center in Florida.  Before getting sober, I was up in school in the northeast.  I took my first drink when I was 16.  I had just gotten my drivers license, and I was with two other guys at a friend's house.  My friends suggested that we drink, and, not wanting them to know that I had never really done that before, I agreed to join them.  It was great -- so great that I decided we should all pile in my car, and drive over to another friend's house.  I had a bunch of peppermint schnapps there and I was flying around in the backyard like an airplane and then -- next thing I knew, I was dry heaving on the bedroom floor.  My friends were on the phone with poison control: turns out they didn't drink either.  My dad came over, picked me up, and took me to the hospital.  I remember the nurse at the hospital recommending that I check out AA.  Ha.  So next morning, my dad cooked me eggs and toast and told me not to do that anymore.  I did, though.  Me and a few other guys, we would get shitfaced almost every weekend.  It was great: I had this problem in highschool -- I felt like I didn't belong.  Everyone I spoke to was either too cool for me, or not cool enough.  I couldn't figure it out how to do this life shit.  I got nervous around girls, I got nervous around guys -- it just wasn't working for me.  But alcohol did the trick.  I felt secure, and my head stopped racing.  I could laugh with ease and comfort, joke, bullshit, and not worry what "they" were thinking about me.  So hey, it worked.  Yeah, I was "that guy" at parties -- but I was at parties!  Before I started drinking, I didn't go to parties.  I puked everywhere -- in girls purses, on $3,000 sofas, in cars, parking lots, restaurants, hotels -- I left little bits of my DNA all over South Florida.  And I was embarassed about it, especially the next morning.  I remember one morning, I woke up at this girls house, and I saw this trail of bright orange puke leading into the bed (no, it wasn't her bed, it was her brother's -- and no, he wasn't in it).  I silently snuck out of the house and drove off.  The next day, in school, the girl asked me what the hell I had done -- why had I puked Doritos all over the place and then not stayed around to clean it up?  I couldn't give her a satisfactory answer.  Guess I'm just like that, I told her.  But I wasn't.  That wasn't me.  Anyway, that kind of thing happened a lot.  Woke up in my backyard sleeping on the Wall Street one morning, woke up with cuts and bruises occasionally, but it was all in good fun.  Sometimes, I would get perscriptions of Xanax, and I would take pills in school -- but I was able to function, I was able to get relatively good grades.  Good enough that I got into a college in the Northeast.  So off I went: headed for Philadelphia.  When I arrived there, I discovered that there was a beer delivery service.  These people actually *delivered* beer to your front door!  It was fabulous.  They didn't ID, either.  So I set about ordering beer on an almost daily basis.  But the greatest part about it all was that almost everyone else was doing it too!  Yeah, there were a few losers who didn't drink, but most of the people around me were into it.  Then they started to get into going to class, and I really wasn't that interested.  I thought drinking was way more interesting.  I started drinking Bacardi 151 alone in my bedroom at night, playing Flight Simulator on the computer for hours.  My new friends would stop by and say, "Rob, why don't you come hang out?" and usually, I'd tell them no, I was taking it easy.  Then, when I got drunk enough, I'd head out.  I'd do things like fall asleep in the snow, or walk into the baseball house and spit on the baseball players.  These guys were bigger than me, and they didn't like being spit on.  I wouldn't remember these things in the morning: people would come up to me and say, "dude, what happened with you last night?", and I'd say, "I don't know, why?", and they'd say, "you were a real asshole", or "you were hilarious!"  Either way, I had no recollection of it.  So my life felt crazy, but I kept thinking that one of these days, I was going to get this thing right.  Drinking was definitely helping my life.  When my girlfriend of a year dumped me right before winter break, my first thought was: it's okay.  I've got a perscription of Xanax in the bathroom cabinet -- 5 refills.  I can get through this.  So I went home, and started popping the Xanax (which were perscribed to help me with my fear of flying).  They worked, better than I had expected -- not only did I get over the girl, but I also got into relationships with several new girls, all at virtually the same time!  I wasn't at all afraid of them, either.  Yeah, the Xanax made it seem a little dull, but I thought that was neat: I was like a rock star, numb to the world and living in drama.  I went back to college, and I took the Xanax with me.  I managed to string the supply out for about four months -- at first, I was taking only a few pills a day, but by the end, I was taking about 10 a day.  During this time, I got into a new relationship with a nice young girl who went to the all girl's school next door.  When I ran out of Xanax, I started to panic.  I remember, it had been about 12 hours since I'd taken my last pill, and I was trying to cross the street.  It was evening, and I was looking at a car approaching, about 500 feet away.  Suddenly, while I was in the middle of the street, the car was right next to me!  I screamed and sprinted across the street.  When I looked back, I saw that the car was still about 300 feet away.  This scared me.  I told my friend about it -- he told me I may be going through withdrawal.  Of course, it was too early for that -- I know that now -- and I was just scared.  But then, it seemed like a real possibility, so I broke down and called my dad.  I told him what I was doing, and he got me connected with a psychiatrist in the area who helped me withdraw from the pills.  Within a few weeks, I had switched to a new drug: GHB.  This stuff gave me a drunken feeling, but I didn't get that sloppiness.  It worked well; the only problem was, I was told that if I took even just a little too much of it, I might have a seizure.  I started taking it every day, and I started to notice that while I was on it, time would suddenly disappear.  I would be sitting on the couch with friends, and then suddenly it would be nighttime and I'd be all alone on the couch, and the couch would bet wet.  I didn't know what was going on: all I knew was that I was falling asleep and pissing myself.  Then, one day, I was heading out with my new girlfriend and a couple of friends to a fair at her school.  I drank a bunch of GHB and got in the passanger seat of her car.  Suddenly, everything seemed very strange and I felt a burst of anger: the next thing I knew, I was in this fantastic dream where I was a character in an F. Scott Fitzgerald novel (Amory Blaine) and then I woke up and a paramedic was screaming at me, his knee jammed into my chest.  I was half naked, and I felt dirty.  I didn't know what was going on, and I started to cry.  The paramedic didn't show much love to me: I later found out that while seizing, I had punched him several times.  I spent the night in the hospital.  My dad flew up to stay with me.  Everyone asked me what I had done, and I finally broke down and told them.  I was still taking small amounts of Xanax to withdraw, and they were flabbergasted.  What was wrong with me, they asked.  Why was I taking drugs?  I didn't have an answer.  I promised I would stop.  The next few weeks were abismal: everyone I knew heard that I had overdosed, and I told them all that I was through.  But at night, I would sneak more GHB into my system.  When I stopped, I returned to drinking.  At least when I drank I didn't have seizures.  So summer came, and I was almost done withdrawing from the Xanax.  I went off to Europe with a friend, and it was a fiasco from the start.  I lost my money and my passport on the airplane; when I arrived in Frankfurt, I had to wait for four hours to get a temporary visa.  I finally connected with my friend, but within a week I had puked all over his stuff and I woke up one morning to him packing his bags.  We were in the Czech Republic, and he said he'd had enough of me.  So I was alone.  I panicked, and called my dad.  I told him I had to come home; he bought me a ticket on a flight leaving Frankfurt in three days.  So I headed back to Frankfurt: I got there, and I put myself up in the nicest hotel I could find.  I didn't have the money for it, but I figured I could get my dad to wire me money.  I couldn't leave the hotel -- I was too scared to go out.  So I drank, alone in the room.  On the second day, I woke up at around 2 in the afternoon to someone knocking on my door.  The hotel manager came in, and said that they needed me to pay for the previous two nights.  I told him I would have to go to the Western Union to get his money: he said that probably wouldn't work, and moments later, two large German policeman came in.  They arrested me.  I told them I could get the money, if they just gave me a chance.  They finally agreed, and took me over to the train station, where there was a Western Union.  I walked in, flanked by these cops, and I gave them my name: they had the money, and they gave it to me.  I was so relieved.  I went back to the hotel and paid them, then I called my dad and told him about it.  I thought he would find it funny.  He didn't.  I got back to the states, and started working for my dad doing yardwork.  I got into smoking pot, and I would do that every day while working.  It was great: I felt free.  I got back to school that fall, and I knew all about weed.  I started dealing, and everybody loved me.  That lasted a few months -- then I couldn't deal anymore, because I started to get paranoid.  I stopped, and so most of my friends disappeared.  I returned to drinking heavily.  One night, I was going to a formal with my girlfriend.  I drank far too much Jack and Coke, and when we were headed out, I got in an argument with her.  I was in the Quad at the all girls school, and I started screaming at her.  A security guard walked up, and I put my arm around him.  I don't remember what happened after that: all I know is that I ended up back in her room.  We were sitting there, when the door opened and four men in uniform came in.  I thought they were more security guards, so when they grabbed me, I tried to shake them off.  They pepper sprayed me, and carted me off to jail.  In the police car, I began to cry, and I tried to eat my fake ID.  It was laminated.  I walked home from jail at about 7 the next morning.  I was all dressed up, dirty and depressed.  When I got to my place, I got a call from one of the deans.  She said they had heard about the "incident": I was mandated to counseling.  I also had court charges pending -- nothing major; just drunken disorderly, underage drinking, and the like.  The counselor told me to go to AA.  He had a lazy eye, and I hated talking to him.  I promised him I wouldn't drink, and for a few weeks, I kept my promise.  Then I started stealing alcohol from my neighbors refridgerator, and painkillers that another one of my neighbors took for his leg.  I went to see a lawyer about the court charges, and he told me to stop drinking.  I told him I already had.  I tried again to stop -- and I made it for about a month and a half.  Then I went back to Europe, this time with my family, and the wine looked so good!  When my step-mom asked me why I was drinking again, I told her it was okay, I understood myself better.  I made arrangements to travel around Europe on my own, and I headed out.  It was great: I travelled around, carried a switchblade, bought hashish in the streets.  I got in a fight, lost a tooth, and slept with a hooker.  I jumped naked off of rocks into the ocean in Croatia with beautiful girls, and I roamed the streets of Amsterdam looking for vagrants to confide in.  I was able to do all those things, because I discovered in Europe that they give you Xanax with a perscription.  The next fall, I returned to school.  I was now worldly, and a junior.  Then, September 11th.  I had smuggled in about a thousand pills of Xanax from abroad, and when I heard the news, I started taking them in large quantities.  I got drunk, too.  I went to class that Tuesday night and told my professor that the reason I was so drunk was because I'd lost an uncle and a brother in the towers.  I didn't have an uncle or a brother in the towers.  I started to black out for days at a time.  I stopped taking care of myself physically, and I started going to class drunk all the time.  Then I stopped going to class.  I started ordering drugs from Pakistan on the internet.  Over Christmas break, they arrived at my house, and my step-mom asked why I was getting packages from Pakistan (this was during the anthrax scare).  I told her I had a friend who needed paperwork from a college there: when she asked why the packages said "Rx", I admitted that it was Xanax.  I had a problem.  But I wasn't going to talk to her about it.  I went back to school.  I wrecked my car several times -- once with three other people in it (I ran into a pole; sideways).  I couldn't go to class anymore.  I moved into a hotel, then I moved into the basement of one of the buildings nearby.  I couldn't talk to anyone anymore.  None of my friends wanted me around -- I was always drunk and violent.  There were no girls left, taking care of me.  I had one friend left: he tried to take care of me, to help me.  He would steal my alcohol and yell at me when I got beligerent.  He drove me around, he took my car to the shop after I wrecked it, then he cleaned it.  He told people I was a nice guy, that I just drank too much.  Of course it all made very little difference: I wasn't about to stop drinking.  I kept several bottles of Jack Daniels in the freezer.  I would always run out on Sunday, and where I lived, there were blue laws -- you couldn't buy alcohol on Sundays from liquor stores.  So I'd go to a bar and pay twice as much as I should for bottles, then I'd take them home and try to drink myself to sleep.  One morning, in early March, I woke up.  I had been in a blackout for several weeks, and suddenly I felt coherent.  I wanted to stop.  I knew that I couldn't -- knew that I wouldn't be able to leave my house if I wasn't drunk, knew that I couldn't sit in my room and not drink; knew that I was screwed.  My skin was on fire, I was pacing the hallway, thinking to myself: 'what do people do in this situation?  Nothing is wrong with me, but I'm going insane!'  So I decided to pray.  I got on my knees by my bed and asked somebody for help.  Then I drank again.  But within the next week, in a blackout, I e-mailed my parents.  I told them I needed help.  I called my dean and arranged for a medical leave of absence.  My mom told me she had already picked out a rehab near home.  So I got on a plane, and headed to my dad's house.  We planned to spend a week together, and then I would check in to rehab.  I made it the first day without drinking.  On the second night, I couldn't sleep and my body was shaking.  So I decided to have a glass of wine.  That turned into four bottles, and off I went in my dad's car, headed for a bad neighborhood.  I picked up a friend and we stayed out all night; I ended up passed out in a park.  He kicked me awake at around 4 in the afternoon and told me he wanted to go home.  When I got back to my house, my dad was livid.  He told me I was going to rehab the next day, and I did.  What happened next is coming soon... I can't believe you've read all this!

         Je Pense, Donc Je Suis.      A man shuffles before us, wrapped in a shawl.  His long dark hair is cut short above his forehead; his dark eyebrows give way to a face shadowed by an oversized nose.  He is shivering this cold, dark morning, walking slowly to the chambers of  urlLink Queen Christina of Sweden , where he will tutor her in mathematics.  It is the winter of 1650, and  urlLink René Descartes  is not accustomed to the morning hours.  He is a gentleman.  It is his custom to rest in bed through the morning; a habit leftover from his childhood, when he was small and sickly.  He is not a man familiar with hard work, yet he has produced some of the greatest ideas of his era.  Here is the man who said  je pense, donc je suis : I think, thus I am.  He seeks irreducibility of ideas: this tenet is the backbone on which he will build a highly critical philosophical system designed to tackle problems in the exact sciences.  As he walks towards the young queen’s chambers, Descartes begins to sniffle.  He does not know it, but he has caught a cold which will shortly reduce him to delirium.  He will die of pneumonia in 10 days, on February 11 th , 1650.  Descartes provides us with a foundation with which we can examine the nature of the abstract.  He has the idea, some say while watching a fly crawl in the corner of his bedchamber, to measure points as distances from set lines, or axes.  Each point he determines to be the intersection of lines parallel to his axes.  He paves the way for the modern  urlLink coordinate system , which allows us to say the following:  Given AB  ^  BC, let x m  = a point on AB and y n  = a point on BC, then the intersection of the  ^  lines formed by drawing DE || BC out from x m  and FG || AB out from y n  forms a point, (x m , y n ) in the coordinate plane.  Descartes is able to see that equations such as  f(x) = x 2   can be visualized by moving the line DE in conjunction with the line FG in a certain ratio.  This idea obviously gives way very quickly to the idea of derivatives and only a generation later  urlLink Newton  and  urlLink Gottfried Leibniz  independently come to discover  urlLink The Calculus .   urlLink E-mail me .

         Hello.      Welcome to Mathematical Solutions, where we believe that life is divided into two categories:  math  and  bullshit , and we're interested in discussing both!  Of course, by "we", I really mean me: my name is Rob Barry, and I'm a student of mathematics at the  University of Miami .  My brief career also includes such notable institutions as  Haverford College  and  Florida International University .  I enjoy life -- a bit too much.  My enjoyment landed me in the  hospital  a few months back (18 to be precise), where I was told... well, that's skipping ahead a bit.  No need to reveal the whole package in the first post!  My interests are varied.  I am currently studying the  Riemann Hypothesis  (what young mathematician isn't?), but my work there is a bit lacking, as I have yet to finish linear algebra.  In fact, I've never produced an original thought in my life -- I'm still trying to catch up with all the thoughts these other people have already had.  I'm also interested, when it comes to math, in  fractal geometry .  I've designed programs that evaluate both the Riemann Hypothesis as well as fractals, but they are written in variants of  BASIC  and are therefore painfully slow.  When I was a young teen, I learned  Turbo PASCAL  -- little did I know that the wave of the future would be this C business!  I don't know how to program C, but plan to learn.  When I was a freshman in college, I tried to learn the  theory of relativity , but really was only able to grasp the  Lorentz Transformation .  I believe that from the perspective of a photon,  the universe is but a point !  Quite an intriguing idea, but I'm sure somebody else has already had it.  I've very little to offer in the way of true knowledge: I proclaim to be versed in various subjects (history, literary theory, mathematics), but I'm not -- it's all a facade.  Except I've lately discovered that one must actually pursue ones interests beyond the level of perusal, and thus I've begun my focus on mathematics.  I find it fascinating that what originated as a way to determine quantities of real objects -- such as sheep -- has provided us with a framework for understanding the universe on the deepest level.  Why should it be that the rules of addition should apply universally?  The question sounds obvious; but the point is not.  This is the area in which subjectivity and objectivity meet: when we have a subjective quantity of sheep, few, and we add another subjective quantity of sheep, also few, we have yet another subjective quantity: more.  Thus, we can say that few plus few equals more.  However, why should this always hold true?  And when we break the sheep down from a subjective few to a quantified and objective five, then we can say that five sheep plus five sheep is always equal to more: ten sheep.  Fingers retain this property, as do crates of marijuana, as do books and museums.  All definable objects in the real world appear to be countable: that is, we can always have a given quantity of real objects, a quantity that can be fixed to infinite precision: we can have two and a half sheep, two and one third sheep, etc., and there is no apparent level of divisibility beyond which we can no longer alter the number of sheep by yet a smaller amount.  The nature of matter probably does not retain this property: it is likely that there is a limit to divisibility; in fact, it is likely that these concepts do not apply at all on the most microscopic levels.  And yet the rules for manipulating numbers appear to apply at all levels, and quite accurately!  The rules appear to always be identical.  What's the deal with that?  It seems so basic and yet so complex.  While I know that complexity is not necessarily dependent on size (see  Stephen Wolfram 's massive new tome on the subject), I also feel that irreducibility of complexity should be something more apparent.  Our brains are structured by the same set of rules, and yet we do not, inherently, seem to understand their more fundamental nature.  I've hit an area on which I can not write with clarity, because my understanding breaks down.  I've never thought it through.  I'd like to know more about this quality of nature, and thus, I've devoted myself to this study of mathematics to the best of my ability.  It takes a lot of work, I've discovered, work that I, for the most part, enjoy.  I'd like to make a remarkable discovery, but I am, I hope, somewhat cognizant of the fact that many brilliant men have already trodden this path, and remarkable discoveries are few and far between.  At most, I genuinely hope to be able to correspond with others regarding this subject.  I hope to be able to post on this Blog frequently, and as a result, to attract some attention to myself -- positive or negative, I do not care -- which, I earnestly hope, will allow me the opportunity to communicate with others.  My name is  Rob Barry , and by clicking on my name, you can send me an e-mail.  My address is rbarry@haverford.edu.  Thank you for joining me!

         Continuity       [10/13.1]    Let (X, d ) and (Y, d 1  ) be metric spaces.  Let  f  : X  &#174;  Y be a constant function.  That is  &#36;  a  y 0    &#206;  Y  &#39;  for all  x   &#206;  X,  f(x) = y 0  .  Show  f  is continuous.   Since | f(x) - f(x o ) | = | y - y 0  | = 0  &#34;  x 0    &#206;  X,  d 1 (f(x),f(x 0 ))  = 0  e      [10/13.2]    The identity function  f(x) = x  is continuous because:   | f(x) - f(x 0 ) | = | x - x 0  |  d   e      [10/13.3]    Let (R, d ), with R the real numbers and  d(a,b)  = | a  -  b |.  Now, we define  f  by  f  : R  &#174;  R by:   f(a)  = {0 if  a  is rational,  a  if  a  is irrational}  We show that  f  is not continuous at any point  r ,  r   &#185;  0.   If  r  is irrational and  x 0    &#206;  Q, then | f(r) - f(x 0 ) | = | r  - 0| =  r .  Thus,  e  1  >  r  and | r  -  x 0  |  d  1 .  However, we know that there is an arbitrarily small distance between  r  and  r 0    &#206;  Q, with | f(r 0 )  -  f(x 0 ) | = 0.  But if | r 0   -  x 0  | > | r  -  x 0  |, then  e  2  >  e  1 , but | r 0   -  x 0  | > | r  -  x 0  | implies that  d  1   d  2 , and this is a contradiction.  Therefore,  f  is not continuous at any point  r   &#185;  0.

          [10/10.1]    Define  h  : P(Z + ) -> {0,1} &times; {0,1} &times; ... &times; {0,1} &times; ... as follows: for the subset A of Z + , let  h (A) = ( a 1  , a 2  ,..., a n  ,...), where  a i   = 1 if  i  is an element of A and  a i   = 0 if  i  is not an element of A.  Show  h  is a bijection.   Let's prove that it's an injection first:   h (A) =  h (A'), then we know that { a 1  , a 2  ,..., a n  ,...} = { a' 1  , a' 2  ,..., a' n  ,...}.  However, if A is not equal to A', then  a i   must differ from  a' i   for some  i  in Z + .  Thus, this function is injective.  To prove it is surjective, we show that for every  a i   in  h (A), multiply  a i   &middot;  i  and if the result is not zero, add it to the set A.  Thus, we can get our original set out of  h (A) for every A; therefore,  h (A) is surjective.  If  h  is both injective and surjective, then it is bijective.  It's interesting to note here that there is no bijection between Z +  and the power series of Z + ; thus, by composition, we can see that there is no bijection between Z +  and our infinite cartesian product.  This implies that an infinite cartesian product is not countable.     [10/10.2]    Let X = {0,1} &times; {0,1} &times; ....  Define  h  : X -> [0,1] by  h ( a 1  , a 2  ,..., a n  ,...) =  a 1   / 2 +  a 2   / 2 2  + ... +  a n   / 2 n  = the infinite summation of  a n   / 2 n  as n goes from 1 to infinity.   Let  r 1   be  h (X) for some X.  Let us examine the cases:  Case 1:  r 1   = 1  X = {1,1,...}  Case 2:  r 1   = 0  X = {0,0,...}  Case 3: 0  r 1     As  i  goes from 1 to infinity, if  r i   => 1 / 2 i  then  r i+1   =  r i   - 1 / 2 i  and  a i   = 1.  This will yield a unique X for any  h (X), thus  h  is surjective.

         On Uncountability      [10/8.1]    If B is a subset of A and B is  urlLink uncountable , then A is uncountable.    This one is easy: we'll just point out that a bijection between B and B exists, and because B is contained in A, that bijection is also an injection into A.  Since there's an injection from an uncountable set into A, then we know that A must also be uncountable.  Define  f  : B -> A by  f(b) = b .  This is obviously a bijection, and since all  b  in B are also contained in A, this is an injection into A.  Thus, A is also uncountable.    [10/8.2]    Using  urlLink [10/8.1] , we show that if A is uncountable and C is not the empty set, then A &times; C is uncountable.    All we need to do is demonstrate there is an injection  f  : A -> A &times; C.  Because we know that C is not the empty set, we let  c  be any element of C by  urlLink the axiom of choice : thus, define  f  : A -> A &times; C by  f(a) = a &times; c , and we're done -- this function is obviously an injection.    [10/8.3]    If f : A -> B is surjective and B is uncountable, then so is A.    If there exists a surjective function  f  : A -> B, then there must exist an injective function  f -1   : B -> A.  We'll call this function  g , and define it rigorously by stating that for all a i  in A, the intersection between g(a 1 ) and g(a 2 ) is the empty set if a 1  is not equal to a 2 .  Now, since this function is a well defined injection from B -> A, and B is uncountable, we can now say that A must be uncountable.    [10/8.4]    On the Cardinality of the Power Set    The following is not my work, so it's probably correct.  We're going to look at the power series of a set.  We denote the power series by P(A), where A is any set and P(A) is all possible subsets of A, including the empty set and A itself.  Let us see why there is no surjection from A -> P(A) by looking at the set of positive integers.  Let P(Z + ) be all subsets of Z +  (A such that A is a subset of Z + ).  There is no surjection from Z +  to P(Z + ).  Suppose  g  : Z +  -> P(Z + ).  We show that  g  is not surjective.  For each n an element of Z + ,  g(n)  is a subset of Z + .  Let B be the set of  m  such that  m  is an element of Z +  but not of  g(n) .  We show that B is not in g(Z + ), the image of  g , by the following:   n , our element of Z + , is in B, our subset of Z +  not in  g(n) , if and only if  n  is not in  g(n) ; this is true if and only if  n  is in Z +  and not in  g(n) .  Sounds redundant, but it demonstrates the following:  If B is the subset  g(n 0 )  for some  n 0   in Z + , then  n 0   is not an element of B (our subset of Z + ) if and only if  n 0   is not an element of our function  g(n 0 ) ; however, if  n 0   is not an element of  g(n 0 ) , then it is in B.  This is a contradiction; therefore, P(Z + ) is uncountable.  Now, the reason we discussed  urlLink [10/8.4]  was so that we might discuss a more general proof:    [10/8.5]    For any set A, there does not exist a surjection of A to P(A) = {all subsets of A}    Let define the function  f  : A -> P(A), thus, for each  n  included in A,  f(n)  is a subset of A.  We know that in order for this to be a surjective function, for every element  m  in P(A), there must be a corresponding element  n  in A such that  f(n) = m .  So let the set B indicate all elements  m  such that  m  is contained in A -  f(n) .  Thus, B = A -  f(n) .  We see that  n  is an element of B iff  n  is not an element of  g(n)  iff  n  is an element of A -  g(n) .  But if  g  is surjective, there must be some  n 0   such that B =  g(n 0 ) ; however, in that case,  n 0   can't be in B, but that's iff  n 0   is an element of  g(n 0 ) , in which case  g(n 0 )  = B.  This is a contradiction: thus there is no surjection from A -> P(A).

         On the Countability of Algebraic Numbers      [10/6.1]    A real number is  urlLink algebraic  if it satisfies some polynomial of positive degree such that:  x n  + a 1 &middot;x n-1  + ... + a n-1 &middot;x + a n   with rational coefficients a i .  Assuming each polynomial equation has finitely many roots, show that the set of algebraic numbers is countable.    The  urlLink fundamental theorem of algebra states  that if P(x) is a polynomial of degree  n , then the equation P(x) = 0 has  n  roots.  Since we know that the roots of the above equation are dependent upon the coefficients (for example, x 1  + a 1  = 0 involves -a 1  as the solution), and since we have the fundamental theorem of algebra, we can say that the number of solutions for a polynomial of degree  n  can be found by taking all possible rational coefficients, and crossing them with a set of  n  elements:  Let A n  be the set Q &times; Q &times; Q &times; ... &times; Q by {a 1 ,a 2 ,...,a n }, and let B n  be any set of n elements, such as {1,1,...,1}.  We know that the number of solutions for a polynomial of degree n can be found by A n  &times; B n , which amounts the set of  n  sets of rational numbers crossed with a set of  n  elements.  Thus, the union of A n  &times; B n  for all  n  in Z +  gives us all possible algebraic numbers.  Because A n  is a finite cartesian product of countable sets, and B n  is a finite set, the cross product of any given A n  and B n  must be countable (the finite product of countable sets is countable).  Finally, we can say that our countable union of a countable set is countable; thus, the algebraic numbers are countable.  If this proof or any other material contained on this blog appear to be incorrect, please  urlLink e-mail  me!  Thanks.

         FCAT Scat    The FCAT (Florida's Comprehensive Assessment Test) may be a load of garbage, but for those who are trying to get through it, these  urlLink sample tests  may prove useful.  The biggest joke: the FCAT truly is meaningless.  When tenth graders fail the FCAT, they have the opportunity to "retake" it in their junior and senior years.  That's all well and good, but because the FDOE (pronounced 'fftdoh', also known as the Florida Department of Education) can't actually let anyone  fail  the FCAT, they've instituted a new test format intended  only  for those students doing retakes.  The new test format is designed "to save time in scoring the tests"; however, a coincidental side effect of this time saving process is that the revised FCAT is much easier then the FCAT given to 10th grade students their first time around.

         Countability and the Infinite    It may be helpful to review the definitions of  urlLink surjective ,  urlLink injective  and  urlLink bijective  functions.  Some simple proofs are located in the post from October 2nd.    [10/4.1]    A subset of countable sets is countable.    The conditions needed to demonstrate that a set is countable are as follows:  (1) there exists a surjection from Z +  -> the set, or (2) there exists an injection from the set -> Z + .  It is only necessary to satisfy (1) or (2), as (1)   (2)   the set is countable.  Now, let us consider a set called B, which is a subset of a countable set called A.  We know there exists an injective function  f  : A -> Z + ; thus, we need only show there also exists an injective function  g  : B -> A, and by proof  [10/2.1]  located below, the composite function (f o g) is injective.  Let us define g by the reflexive relation  g(x) = x .  Thus, for every  b  in B,  g(b) = b ; we can easily show that this is injective.  Since we know that B is contained in A, we can say that g(B) is also contained in A; thus,  (f o g) (B) -> Z +  is injective.  Thus, we can say that a subset of a countable set is countable.    [10/4.2]    Z +  &times; Z +  is countably infinite.    In order to demonstrate that Z +  &times; Z +  is countabily infinite, we need only construct an injection from Z +  &times; Z +  -> Z + .  Thus, define f : Z +  &times; Z +  -> Z +  by  f(x,y) = 2 x &middot;3 y  .  Because  urlLink the fundamental theorem of arithmetic  states that any positive integer can be represented in exactly one way as a product of primes  urlLink [10/2.5] , we know that for each  x  and  y , there is a unique  f(x,y)  contained in Z + .  Thus,  f  is an injection and therefore Z +  &times; Z +  is a countably infinite set.    [10/4.3]    Q +  is countably infinite.    We can prove this quite simply by noting that there is an injection from Q +  -> Z +  &times; Z +  as follows:  Let  p / q  be any element of Q + , with  p  and  q  each contained in Z + , and  p  and  q   urlLink relatively prime .  Thus, we construct our function f : Q +  -> Z +  &times; Z +  by  f(p,q) = p &times; q .  We know that  p &times; q  is contained in Z +  &times; Z +  for all  p  and  q , thus f is an injection.  By  urlLink [10/4.2] , we know that there exists an injection from Z +  &times; Z +  -> Z + , and from  urlLink [10/2.1] , we know that a composition function is injective if the members of the composition are injective.  Thus, let g : Z +  &times; Z +  -> Z +  as an injection.  So,  (g o f)(p,q)  is an injection into Z + ; therefore, Q +  is countably infinite.    [10/4.4]    Let A be the set of all functions that map {0,1} -> Z + .  Is A a countable set?    Yes.  We can in fact define  f  : {0,1} -> Z +  by  f(x) = c&middotx n  + a , with  c ,  n , and  a  elements of Z + .  Thus, we can create the function  g  : Z +  &times; Z +  &times; Z +  -> Z +  by  g(c,n,a) = 2 c &middot;3 n &middot;5 a  .  By the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, we can say that this function is a bijection; thus, we can consider B to be the set of Z +  &times; Z +  &times; Z +  to be the set of coefficients in  f .  Since this is a finite cartesian product of countable sets, we know that the set B is countable, and since all coefficients of  f  are contained in B, we can create a bijection between A and B quite easily; thus, A is a countable set.    [10/4.5]    Let B be all subsets of Z +  with exactly 3-elements.  Argue whether or not B is coutnable.    Let there be an index of B, call it  n : thus, B n  is some subset of three elements of B.  Define the indexing function as follows:   f  : Z +  &times; Z +  &times; Z +  -> Z +  by  f(x,y,z) = 2 x &middot;3 y &middot;5 z  .  Thus, B f(x,y,z)  gives us the set B n  containing { x , y , z } in Z +  &times; Z +  &times; Z + .  B is therefore countable.

         Surjections, Injections, and Bijections (onto functions and one-to-one functions)      [10/2.1]    If f : X -> Y and g : Y -> Z are injective, then (g o f) is injective.    f(X) is contained in Y, call it B.  Since g(Y) is contained in Z for all Y, and B is contained in Y, g(B) is contained in Z.  Since B is defined as f(X), then g(f(X)) is contained in Z for all f(X), and since f(X) is contained in Y for all X, then g(f(X)) is contained in Z for all X.  Thus, (g o f) is injective.    [10/2.2]    If f : X -> Y and g : Y -> Z are surjective, then (g o f) is surjective.    Let A be f(X).  Since f is surjective, Y is contained in A.  Since g is surjective, Z is contained in g(Y).  Since Y is contained in A, then Z is contained in g(A).  Now, since A is defined as f(x), then Z is contained in g(f(X)).  Thus, (g o f) is surjective.    [10/2.3]    Given f : R -> R by f(x) = 4x - 5.  Show f is a bijection.    First, we must show that f is an injection.  Given x and x', we know that f(x) = f(x').  We need to show that x = x', which is simply a matter of doing the algebra:  4x - 5 = 4x' - 5 4x = 4x' x = x'  Second, we need to show that f is a surjection; that is, for every element y contained in B, there is a corresponding element x contained in A such that f(x) = y.  This is also simply a matter of algebra -- we need only find the inverse of f(x) and ensure that the function f(f^-1(x)) = x  y = 4x - 5 y + 5 = 4x (y + 5) / 4 = x  f((y + 5) / 4) = x 4((y + 5) / 4) - 5 = x (y + 5) - 5 = x y = x  Thus, f is a surjection.  And since f is an injection and f is a surjection, then f is a bijection.    [10/2.4]    Given f : R -> R and f is differentiable on the interval (a, b), a   0 for all x in (a, b), then f is injective on (a, b).    This statement basically says: if we know that f(x) is continuously increasing on the interval (a, b), then we want to show that for some y in Y, there is one and only one corresponding x in X.  It's obvious when one considers the graph, but to prove it, we must consider the  urlLink Mean-Value Theorem .  This theorem states that for some point c on the interval (a, b), derivative f'(c) is equal to the slope of the line (a, f(a))-(b, f(b)).  Thus, we can say the following: let a1 and a2, a1   0, we can say that for all a1 and a2,  (f(a2) - f(a1)) / (a2 - a1) > d  where d is a positive real number.  Thus,  f(a2) = -a1 * d + a2 * d + f(a1)  Since we know a2 > a1 and d is a positive real number, then we can say that a2 * d > a1 * d, thus (a2 * d) - (a1 * d) > 0.  We can then say that f(a2) > f(a1) for any a2 > a1.  Now, we consider a2 = a1:  f(a2) = -a1 * d + a2 * d + f(a1) f(a2) = f(a1)  Thus, f is an injection.    [10/2.5]    Let X = Q+.  Define f : Q+ -> Z+ as follows: for each element p/q in Q+ (p, q integers with no common factors), set f(p/q) = 2^p * 3^p.  Show f is an injection.    Let us consider the possible cases of p, q, p', q', and prove by contradiction.  For p not equal to p' and q = q',  f(p/q) = f(p'/q) 2^p * 3^q = 2^p' * 3^q  Because p is not equal to p', we can assume that p > p', thus:  2^(p-p') * 3^q = 3^q 2^(p-p') = 1  But this is a contradiction, for 2^0 = 1 and p is not equal to p'.  Case #2: p = p' and q is not equal to q':  Because q is not equal to q', we can assume that q > q', thus:  2^p * 3^(q-q') = 2^p 3^(q-q') = 1  but again, this is a contradiction, for it imples that q = q'.  Thus, we have shown by induction that f is an injective function.

      I've just returned from the 47 th  ICYPAA.  It was held at the Peabody Hotel in Orlando.  There were about 2,500 of us staying in the hotel, and several hundred others flocking in from the Orlando area.  We stayed up all night for several days straight, we consumed thousands of gallons of Red Bull, we smoked many, many cigarettes.  Only at ICYPAA do you find a drum circle in the Peabody lobby at 3am.  I spoke to a hotel employee, who said, "Yes, we sometimes get crazy groups here.  I've never seen a drum circle in the lobby, especially not at 3 in the morning."  I stayed with Carissa, Adi, Carl, Sara, Natalie, and Rita.  Most of Miami was there.  I'm still really burned out.

      So it happened: I had my big break.  I knew it was big when they told me my first part: I was the guy in the background, reading an "artsy" magazine.  I am, by appearance, artsy.  This is something towards which I have always aspired.  Then came the really big news: I was to have a close-up shot.  I am in the foreground, standing right next to the guy who's actually saying lines (who happens, purely by coincidence, to be my dad).  Then, at just the right moment, I receive a helping of mustard on my plate.  I start to walk away and then -- this was really where I had a chance to let my talents shine -- I realize I don't have enough mustard.  So I walk back in front of the camera, gesture in annoyance at my plate, and receive another dollop of mustard.  Now, I know what you're thinking: Rob, you need to have a  speaking  role in order to join the Screen Actor's Guild!  Why didn't you  say  something?  Well, actually, my not-so-savvy little friend, a speaking role alone won't give you Screen Actor's Guild eligibility: you need something more than just one or two words to get your SAG membership.  You need to say  five  words.  Once you're around long enough, you'll find that out yourself -- but I figured I'd let you in on a little secret.  I obviously need to be important.  I wish I were really hot.  I'm moderately good looking, but if I were an extremely sexual beast, I could be a movie star, and then I'd be happy for sure.  Also, I've decided to stop posting so many pictures on this website.  They (1) take too much time, and (2) really don't add much.  I just have to write more filler text -- otherwise, they jumble up on top of each other.  So from here-on out, expect less pictures!  You can always expect less from me.

      I was just lying in bed.  I was thinking.  It suddenly dawned on me that I'm trying to prove myself to the world.  This is one of those middle of the night revelations -- they provide solace for the hour, and fade away in the mist of dawn.  But I want to hold on to it.  It's evidenced everywhere: I just joined  urlLink Friendster , which is this (buggy) network that allows you to make social contacts.  It appears that about half of my highschool is on there, as well as many people from Haverford.  While I was reading into these people's lives, I couldn't help but compare myself to them.  The interesting thing about comparing myself to others is that I always come out above, or below.  Wherein lies the problem?  How shall I even the playing field?  How can I compare myself to somebody, and not rank myself against them?  I can't.  The problem doesn't lie in the process of comparison: it lies in the thoughts of myself.  That's it -- thinking of myself is, in essence, a waste of time.  There's nothing that comes of it; temporary ego inflation, deflation, whatever -- it's all just fabric for the fodder of my imagination.  How do I stop thinking about myself?  That's a good one!  Lots of people have lots of answers for this.  I find that sitting at Starbucks and talking to a kid who is crazier than I am helps.  Prayer helps.  Writing inventories helps.  God really is sufficient in disposal of affairs.  That's really my goal: to continue to develop a one-on-one relationship with my creator.  And I can't dodge this one: I've got to stand up to my beliefs, and live them.  I can't spew out spiritual guruisms, and then placate my ego with self-aggrandizement.  It doesn't work like that.  I can't placate you by telling you what I think you want to hear, leaving out any mention of God.  And then, the best part of all -- I can't do a damn thing about it.  How am I going to think my way out of my thoughts?  Fortunately, God is greater than I am, and the flow of life is far more powerful than the flow of my thoughts.  I don't believe the new-agers who say that reality is literally a reflection of our thoughts: I think that lends far too much credibility to our minds.  Thinking may be a remarkable process, but the unfolding of the universe is a far more powerful thing.  Then again, ask a quantum physicist what he thinks, and he might tell you otherwise.  But that's for another day.

       I got to go out to the set of  urlLink Dave Barry's Guide to Guys , which is a movie that Dave is working on.  The director and screenwriter is  urlLink Jeff Arch ,  who was the screenwriter for  urlLink Sleepless in Seattle .  Dave is going to be in it -- I even heard him practicing his line ('guys care deeply...').  He was doing a shoot with a well known South American heartthrob actor whose name is Carlos.  I'm not sure what his last name was, but he was funny.  And apparently, extremely good looking.  I didn't think he was amazing, but the girls there seemed to have a different opinion.  Let me recount an incident:   Carlos and Dave were riding up the street in this contraption -- it was an old, beat up van attached to a really spiffy pickup truck.  They were doing this shoot, and they wanted it to look like they were actually driving.  So they went up a small side-street in Pinecrest.  The contraption takes up the whole road: at one point, an oncoming car with two middle-aged Hispanic women was forced onto the grass.  They drove by, and then, upon seeing who was in the van, they threw their car into reverse and backed up.  "You are even more good looking in real life then in the movies!", they said to Carlos.   After the incident, he said, "I paid them to say that."  You see?  A cool guy.  In the picture above, you can see Dave's head sticking out of the side of the van.  It's circled in red, so you can't miss it.  I got a part in this movie, although I don't think it'll make my acting career.  I think I'm going to be an extra, but the shoot is going to be tomorrow (Thursday) at around 5pm at the Omni.  I'm going to take pictures, so I can prove that I was actually filmed by a camera for an actual movie.  I think I play the guy in the background flipping a coin or drinking from a water fountain or something, but still -- SAG here I come!

       This weekend, Carissa and I went off on an adventure to return a movie.  You wouldn't expect this to turn into a mystery novel, would you?  Well, it did.  Not literally.  On our way to the Blockbuster in South Miami, we somehow found ourselves in Coconut Grove.  Now this, right off, did not bode well for a timely movie return: Coconut Grove can be a very dangerous place when it comes to aimless youths in cars (which is exactly what the two of us were).  We found a parking place, left the car behind, and headed out into the street.  The first mystery of the day was the mystery of the drum people.  Who were they?  Why were they unloading several dozen drums from their car?  I didn't stop to ask: the scene seemed a little too dangerous.  So we continued on our way.   The next thing we came to was the Graffiti Building.  Now this, in itself, is not so remarkable: a lot of buildings have Graffiti on them.  But this building was actually  painted  with Graffiti, and I thought the only place they did that was on the New York Subway.  Well, I don't know what the deal was, or what kind of strange deals went down in this building, but I thought it would be a good idea to take a picture, and immortalize the building on my website, where it will be seen by thousands upon thousands of curious web-tourists.   Ask yourself this: what is the man in the picture doing?  Is he smoking a cigarette?  Or is it something else?  And why are there musical notes coming out of the smoke?  Is the building a music factory?  Or perhaps it's a Graffiti store, and they're advertising their colors... or maybe it was just a random, drive by, very complex graffiting.  We may never know, because the building was quite foreboding and looked deserted.  For God's sake, are those  sperm ?  Who would go through all that trouble to paint a building with graffiti, and then desert it?  I might do something like that.  I'd probably get bored with my building and want a new one.  That's what happened to my room -- well, actually, I wasn't bored of it, but I did desert it after painting it many different colors.  There were no curious smoking men in my room, however (except for me -- I occasionally smoked in the bedroom, I admit it).  So that's it for the day's mysteries... Extraordinary.

       When entering a pet store, one does not expect to be confronted with the dilemma of whether or not the purchase of "bull penises" is a fiscally sound idea.  Pictured to the right, these penises range from the "small" 6-inches to the very large 24-inchers.  My dog, Pooka, who has been featured on this website in the past, is definitely a fan of these penises.  The pet store places a barrel of them right by the front door, and Pooka always follows her nose directly to these strangely shaped cocks.  So the first and most obvious question is: are they naturally 24 inches?  No.  They've been stretched -- and I'd say that's a relief for almost all mankind.  Do we really need that kind of inter-species competition?  What kind of girl would go for that, anyway?  (Hint: the cool kind!)  Actually, one can find bull penises all over the place: apparently, they've been used as walking sticks for many years, and are also an essential ingredient in a certain kind of Jamaican soup.   Another desirable pet accessory: boots.  These boots are available for only $15.95 -- essential to the happiness of any well adjusted dog.  Particularly in Miami.  The pavement can be scorching, and these boots protect a dogs sensitive padded soles from excruciating heat.  Why can't they make human shoes that "fit all breeds"?  Shaq and I definitely can't wear the same shoe; why can Pooka, a chihuaha, wear the same shoes as a great Dane?

       I think the image to the right is a model of an electromagnetic vector field.  I wrote a program in Visual Basic and started playing with it, and ended up with this image.

Poor spelling can ruin the hole post. Homonym misuse is one of the greatest foh pahs in published writing. One can immediately find the amateur when he misspells foreign phrases.

       The question is: what does it mean?  I'll give you one hint: the word inscribed on the little him's chest is "WORK".  You can't see that, because I took the picture with my phone while peeing in the toilet at a Greek restaurant called Mykonos (possibly not called that, but that is a good Greek sounding word).  I went there to get three falafel sandwiches.  Here's a tip: when you don't know exactly how to spell a word, go to  urlLink Google  and do a search for the word as you know how to spell it.  It'll come back with a suggestion on the top if you misspelled it ("Do you mean falafel?")  That's how the English majors do it.  How do the French majors do it?  With touche, s'il vous plait!  If I had really wanted to, I could have added accents.

      I went over with Brad to take a look at the place, and it looks like we're going to get it.  It'll take several weeks to get approved by the condo association, and I've got to give 30 days notice to my landlady -- but I think we're going to go through with it.  Here's the lobby:             And the living room:                         Here's the view:                                     Yeah.  I'm excited.

       Last night, we watched Shrek 3D.  I recommend it.  Definitely an entertaining experience.  Later on, after the sun came up in the morning, I got out of bed and went over to Hector's house. .  Hector and I went for an adventure, which I won't recount here, suffice to say that cigarettes and mayonnaise were intimately involved.  After school, I went out with my friend Bob (who's picture I won't put here, because I forgot to ask his permission).  Bob and I went to the Biltmore.  I don't know if you've ever been there, but it's absolutely gorgeous.  It used to have the largest pool in the known universe.  The world's largest swimming pool is now  urlLink here  (no, not literally in that word, but follow that link and you'll probably be bored).      My friend Beah is named after bouganvillas -- that was her nickname when she was little, and she couldn't pronounce it so she started saying "Beah".  I'm sure you see the connection.      So here are some bouganvillas, in Beah's honor.      Here's the corridor you've got to walk down in order to get to the pool --      Which, as you can see, is stunning -- more pictures --          Next post, I'll put up pictures of my new apartment, which is really beautiful.  The main concern I have about it is that the people who live and work in this place are  really  weird.  I wouldn't be surprised if they were all CIA agents... I hope I don't get molested!  (Who doesn't?)

      Question out of my physics textbook:  How much would it cost to paper the entire United States (including Alaska and Hawaii) with dollar bills?  What would be the cost to each person in the United States? They don't give me any information on this one, so I'm going to have to get the details myself.  The total area of the United States is 3,537,441 mi 2   urlLink [source]  The population of the United States is 293,293,385 people  urlLink [US Census Bureau (this is pretty cool!

       I'm feeling pretty crappy today.  I left my bar shift early last night in order to take the cat to the emergency clinic -- she was hacking and sneezing and having trouble breathing.  Needless to say, when we got her to the vet, she was not happy.  The vet took a quick look at her and suggested that we leave her overnight -- for the nominal fee of $598.75.  This was not cool, but he was suggesting that we'd do it if it was our child, so we should do it for the cat.  And I guess we agreed, because we left her there.  It was most likely for the best: it was clear that the cat was not well.   This morning, Carissa went by at around 7 and picked her up.  I got up and took her to our vet, and he checked her out for feline AIDS and this other disease called FIP.  It was scary for a few moments, because the paper that the emergency vet gave us said "differential diagnosis: ... FIP".  I asked the vet what FIP was, and he said it was a fatal disease; so for a little while, I thought that Duchess was going to die.  Fortunately, that turned out to mean "possible" diagnosis -- and she came back negative for anything  really  serious, although she does have pneumonia.  I don't know why I feel so crappy, really, because this is good news.  Brad is also calling me about getting a place -- I told him I really was only interested in The Mark, but I don't know, something in my gut is just a little twisted.  And then, by the grace of God (BYGG), Bob W called and asked if I wanted to hang out with him at the Biltmore tomorrow.  Of course, I want to hang out at the Biltmore, and I'd hang out with Bob even if it was at the barber shop.  He said that I seemed to be going through a "transition" phase; I don't know what that means, I like to interpret it to mean "growing up", but that doesn't seem likely.  I'm afraid of speaking at a meeting right now, and that really bothers me.  It's not that normal jittery feeling -- last night, I was working the bar, and I realized that at some point I might have to do the announcements, and this made me run cold with fear.  This is very strange, because I've come to  enjoy  doing the announcements.  So, you say, a Blog about "his life" doesn't really get him out of himself?  Well, there's got to be something that can be done about that!  What should I turn this in to?  I enjoy spewing, and I like posting pictures -- there must be some positive, productive outlet in all of this.

       This is "Big Mike".  He's in Israel at the moment -- don't ask me why.  I'm sure he won't mind having his picture plastered on the internet; as you can see, he enjoys attention.  Hopefully, his mom will never discover this site (although I don't think she'd be entirely shocked).  Mike is a powerful force in the world of talking: he does it a lot.  He also recently purchased a new pair of white shoes, which really do look good when he's wearing black and white, but which have the potential to go horribly wrong.  I've known Mike for a little over two years, and I've enjoyed every minute of it -- except for the times when I'm with him.  I love you, Mike.  You know, there are bugs in my house, and I really would like them to be gone.  I don't know what they want: there is no food in here.   This building is called The Four Ambassadors.  The realtor has found a studio apartment there for $850 -- it has a view of the water, and it's classified as a "PH", which I really hope means penthouse.  I doubt it'll be as good as The Mark, because that place was built in 2001 and this place was built in 1968.  I defy you to find anything that was built in 1968 that looks good.

      I love taking pictures at night with long exposures.  I get this feeling of freedom in my gut -- it's like I'm an explorer.    One of the more interesting problems with taking night shots is finding a stable location for the camera.  I can't hold it perfectly still with my hands -- I have to find a surface to put it on, but one that doesn't take away from the look of the picture.  The image above was taken on the trunk of my car: it was a very high-tech shot.      Sometimes it's nice to take the picture from the ground.  This shot was a little nerve wracking, because I had the camera out in the middle of the street.  I live on a fairly busy corner, and sometimes people come whipping around very fast.  Fortunately, both the camera and I survived.      Here's the first shot, except this time from the ground.  I like the illusion that you get with ground shots that the floor is somehow curved upwards at the edges.      This one is not really a great shot, but I love the fact that this is the view that I have out of my front door.  I don't live in a good neighborhood, but in some ways, it really pays to be in Miami...      And of course, the gratuitous "me" shot.  It's hard to look so serious for so long, believe me.   Do you believe they wanted $1,200 for a single bedroom in this place?  It's mind-boggling!  This is  not  a great neighborhood.  How can they think they're going to get away with it?  Bastards.  I guess they did get away with it.  I've got to go -- apparently, in order to go to Greece, I've got to give my passport number to the travel agent.  This is very exciting... I'm leaving on August 10th, and returning on the 20th.

        KIBO : "[acronym] Knowledge In, Bullshit Out. A summary of what happens whenever valid data is passed through an organization (or person) that deliberately or accidentally disregards or ignores its significance. Consider, for example, what an advertising campaign can do with a product's actual specifications."  urlLink  [TheFreeDictionary.Com]    urlLink James 'Kibo' Parry  is not a genius and he's not insane.  He's funny, though.  Take, for example, his gallery of images, which includes many pictures of cones and yellow "wet floor" signs (the image here was blatantly lifted off  urlLink his website ).  Kibo is delightfully amusing at times, but isn't as sharp-edged as I would like: for example, his brief aside "Yay! Two SAT words in one sentence" is cute, but the joy in humor is knowing that the author meant to do it, but he didn't point it out to you.  The less words, the better: this is an axiom of writing.  I hated creative writing: they were always telling me that, and giving me pictures to write stories about or saying "write a poem starting with the word  meatloaf ..."  It's detestable!  One can not  teach  the art of writing: I'd like you to find me one  really  good author who wrote something splendid, and see how many creative writing courses  he  took.  The forgoing paragraph is an exercise in using too much  emphasis .  Physics was interesting, in that we didn't cover anything I didn't already know.  But that's to be expected: I'm a nerd, and it was just the first day.  I was excited to see that the Lorentz transformation was among the material that is taught in this textbook.  That transformation is what got me interested in physics in the first place!  [Math Geeks, please stop reading now]: I notice that the  urlLink Lorentz transformation  looks a lot like arc length in two dimensions (i.e. sqrt(1 - (dx/dy)^2).  When one thinks about relativity, one is forced to grapple with the obscene fact that the speed of light is a constant.  Of course, this immediately leads to the question: what is speed?  I guess the way that I see it is that light is not actually "moving" -- this is actually kind of obvious, because from the perspective of a photon, there is no distance between points -- so when we observe movement, perhaps we aren't really getting the big picture.  I wonder if there's anyone out there who is with me on this... I know if I were a physics professor, and I were to read this, I would think: "that's nice kid, get a clue".  Good thing I'm not a physics professor, eh?  Good thing nobody is a physics professor... except for the physics professors.

      For the "flip" side of things, read William Safire's little editorial in the NY Times:  urlLink Sarin?  What Sarin? ... just trying to provide a little spectrum after that damning Sy Hersh article -- which, you'll notice, Safire completely ignores: "We flagellate ourselves for mistreatment by a few of our guards, who will be punished." After reading the article, tell me -- do you think that you're a defeatist?  I think I'm a defeatist: what the fuck are we doing in Iraq?  Can somebody just answer that, instead of telling me the reasons why we shouldn't say no to going to Iraq?  If we're there for human rights, then we should maybe look at our relationship with China.  Too idealistic a thought process?  Could be.  If we're there for oil, then why does it cost $2.07 to buy 87 grade gas?  And if we're there for terrorists, well:  what  terrorists?  Osama?  Osama who?  Are we always kept in the dark like this?  I'm just a kid: 23 years old, I don't remember 'nam or Oliver North, but man, what a strange country (world?) this is.

      Physics starts tomorrow.  I'm not thrilled, particularly because it's 2:42 am and class is in 6 hours.  But I can't sleep!  It's always like this for me right before I begin a new round of classes: not exactly anxious, but just awake.  I knew that as soon as I finished my exams, I'd stop posting here as often.  Also, a friend of mine e-mailed me and said that the site was "stupid... no, sophomoric", so I got a bit embarrassed.  But basically, fuck him: he was just kidding, anyway.  But I took it to heart.  Plus, I thought to myself: what are most 23 year olds doing?  Are they making weblogs?  Especially weblogs about themselves?  Well, I've tried to make these blogs about "current events" or "mathematics", and I never keep them up!  So I'm just going to have to go with this for now... besides, it's fun.  For me.  Not necessarily for you.  Especially if I'm standing over your shoulder, making you read it.  I need to sit down with Rick and Marcia and discuss the fact that I'm interested in moving.  I'm sure we can work something out financially: the lease, which is not actually "binding" at this point but I'd like to respect it, ends in August; thus, even if I do leave within the month, there will only be two months that I need to pay.  Or whatever.  We'll see.  I looked at an apartment today in "The Mark Yacht Club" -- it was gorgeous!  I mean, I was totally blown away.  It's $2,000, and my friend Brad wants to pay $1,200 of that.  I'd  really  like to live alone, but this almost seems like to good to pass up.  The thing is, Brad and I have a certain professional (is that what I'm calling it now?) relationship which precludes moving in together; thus, before we'd move in together, we'd have to end that particular interaction, and that'll be a shame.  I bet you have no idea what I'm talking about.  In other news: Women want men to be princes and kill giants.  More on that coming soon.

       This website is supposed to be about the life of 'that guy', aka me -- but that's so self-centered, and once in a while we do have to get out of ourselves.  If you have use of at least one eye, you probably know about the recent prison abuse scandal that has rocked the current administration -- in particular, Donald Rumsfeld.  An article that came out on  urlLink The New Yorker 's website yesterday points the finger directly at Rumsfeld's Under-Secretary for Intelligence, Stephen Cambone.  The piece was written by Seymour Hersh, and can be found by following  urlLink this link .  The story is actually a follow-up on Hersh's article last week, entitled " urlLink Torture at Abu Ghraib: American soldiers brutalized Iraqis.  How far up does the responsibility go? "  Now, I know Seymour isn't entirely to be trusted -- for a good conservative spin response, check out FrontPage Magazine's " urlLink See More Hersh ", by Lowell Ponte.  But overall, if even some of Hersh's information is correct, it certainly presents a fascinating story.  Rumsfeld  needed  to get rapid responses out there on the battlefield in Afghanistan -- I think most people will understand that.  These ops worked so well in the covert atmosphere of Afghanistan, the DD seems to have thought they could bring it into the more open battlefield in Iraq: this almost reads as an honest mistake.  What really scares me is that it's pretty clear these guys don't know what they're doing.  Obviously, that's always the case: we're all humans, none omniscient -- a few of us are just lucky sometimes -- but I like to at least be able to fantasize that they're somehow "in control" up there in the White House.  Even if I don't agree with what Bush does, it's been a comfort that he's so damn sure of himself.  But this time, well... as some Yahoo board's poster put it: "To the Arabic world, Bush has now proved Osama right."

       urlLink   A while back, I made a bunch of fractals.  In case you're really curious, these fractals are generated by equations of the form:  urlLink    and they're really quite gorgeous when given good coloring.  I've seen much better than mine: there are some guys out there who have got images with a sort of shading that makes it look like they're colored in 3D -- it's hard to explain, but it looks awesome.  I'd like to find some use for these images, or other images like them.  There are a lot of cool pictures that can be made using mathematical equations, and I think when the pictures are cool enough, they even generate some interest in math.  I know that when I was a kid, I saw pictures of fractals, and it got me interested.  If you've got any interest in this stuff, please  urlLink e-mail me !

       Adi is inspecting the couch to make sure that there is no nookie on it.  Her exact words are too vulgar to recount here, but needless to say, her inspection is in vain.  Adi is on a mission to understand racism: this is why we are watching  The Birth of a Nation  (yes, we're still watching it).  Next, we'll be watching  urlLink Gone With the Wind .  I don't think that racism can be easily understood from an intellectual perspective.  It seems that it's more of an emotion than a concise thought -- how does one comprehend anger, or happiness?  These things are not easily quantified.

        I knew it all along.  Apparently a Mexican air force pilot recently videotaped what are described as eleven unidentified flying objects.  I blatantly lifted these photos off a local news website  urlLink [WSVN 7 News Online] .  The article says: " The objects appear to accelerate rapidly and change course suddenly. At least one crew member testified in a videotaped interview that the objects encircled the military jet at a distance of at least two miles ".   Speaking of fabulous piano players: if any of you have seen  Greg , please tell him to contact me.  I've always wondered what happened to him.  He would put his head down and just jam out some incredible jazz on my little Panasonic keyboard.  I met him one night while I was incredibly high.  My friend Qaid had called me and left a message, saying: "Whatever you do, don't smoke the weed!"  I didn't get the message until 2am, and by that point I had already smoked it, so of course I freaked.  I tried calling him back but there was no answer, so I headed over to his place (he lived right across the street).  I got there, and the door was locked.  But there was another kid in the hallway, just sort of standing there, looking dazed.  Because I was so high, I figured he might know why Qaid had called: I asked him, and he said, "I might know."  So I started pumping him for information.  "The birds, man... you've got to listen to the fucking birds."  That's really what he said.  A few minutes later, security guards came over, saying they'd received reports of a suspicious prowler.  I covered for my new friend, and told them he was just visiting me.  They looked around a bit, and the whole while, this guy is telling  them  that they need to listen to the birds.  It was great.  I was entirely fucked up myself, and they told me to look after him.  They thought  he  was stoned.  It turned out that Greg was just like that: a very interesting guy.  Brilliant, and fantastic piano player, like I said.  It was always a little tricky to figure out what was going on up there in his head -- sometimes, during conversation, he would get mad at some perceived insinuation, and he wouldn't speak again for several minutes.  But damn could he play the piano.

           My friend Brad gave me these Q-Tips so that I might clean my ears.  He suggested that the practice of  not  cleaning the ears is actually somewhat disgusting: something akin to not brushing one's teeth.     To me, not cleaing the ears is like not cleaning the bathtub (which I just cleaned).  It doesn't really make a difference: nobody but you is going to know it's dirty, and you can probably get over it.  But I understand: some people have the need to  feel  clean, rather than just appear clean.  To me, these people are crazy: who cares if you're dirty or clean, so long as you look good?  Actually, that's not what I think at all: I hate being dirty.  There are just certain regions that I accept as dirty.  They will always get dirty -- why fight them?  It is better to remain in ignorance.

         Cece  This is my friend, Cece.  I've known her for about two years.  Cece is a highschool student.  She's almost done, but until sometime in early June, she retains the title of "senior".  Then, she graduates, and if all goes well, she goes off and becomes a "freshman" again at some university somewhere.  I don't know if she's going to do that.  Cece amazes me because she lets me see what it's like to go to public school in Miami.  She's a smart girl.  She gets by in school.  But the thing is, she doesn't have to  do  anything.  This blows my mind!  It doesn't even seem that she needs to be there in order to graduate!  How does this work?  If I remember correctly, I had something like 89 absences my senior year, but I couldn't just get away with it: I came very close to not graduating, and was only able to get out by pulling strings with the administration.  The public school system in Miami-Dade county is atrocious.  I mean, it's the worst.  Florida alone isn't so great: for example, in 2002, we ranked 41st out of the 50 states for instructional staff per 10,000 capita  urlLink [NEA Rankings] .  The average salary of a Florida public school teacher in the 2000-01 school year was $38,230 -- that's 29th in the nation, with the national average $43,400 [see above].  So, as a state, we're paying our teachers $5,170 less than the national average.  The best teacher's salaries: Connecticut ($52,693), California ($52,480), New Jersey ($52,268), and New York ($51,500).  So when you've got an excellent teacher making the choice between moving to Connecticut or Florida, they're going to see 15,280 reasons why they should pick Connecticut.  So you may be asking yourself: what does this have to do with Cece?  Well, I've got to clean the bathtub, so I'll let you figure it out...

      So, she tells me I wasn't shot down.  I don't really know what's going on anymore.  I'm not upset about it; took a few hours, though.  I really freaked out last night.  Got my next exam today: Statistics!  I'm going to take it, then I'm going to come home and clean shit off the floor.  This is the reason there is shit on the floor:      Pooka   She's probably the cutest dog alive.  We found her on the side of the 836 (the airport expressway) running around in a panic.  Put up ads and everything, but nobody claimed her.  So she's ours.  All ours.  Muahaha.

      She said no.  I'm so upset, I don't understand it.  I guess, looking back on my last post, I kind of had it in terms of money -- but that's not what I was feeling in my heart!  I really love her, and I wanted to take "that next step".  Shit.  She seems to think that moving in together officially is actually going backwards somehow.  I guess her view is just different from mine.  Wrong, damn it!  She's wrong -- moving in together is getting closer, not farther apart.  I feel all fucked up over this.  I was supposed to work a bar shift tonight, and I bailed.  I just want to cry, but I feel so meladramatic about it.  At some point, she ended up suggesting that I start staying in my place during the week.  So when I got home, I picked up all of my shit and took it over to my house.  Now I'm in my house.  Ugh.  I don't want to be like this.  God, grant me the serenity... why do I feel so worked up about it?  It's not like she rejected me, she said she loves me and she actually said she was glad I was so upset about it, because it shows her that I wasn't coming from the "money" end of it.  But shit, what do I have to do?  I guess I understand -- I never believe that she loves me, either.  I hope things work out...

        I asked Carissa if I could move in with her today.  I'm shaking I'm so nervous about the whole thing.  I practically live with her as it is, and I know that she likes having me around; I pay $500 to stay in a place that I don't ever sleep at, and she pays $650 for her place -- it seems like it makes sense to split the costs of living in just one place.  Instead of saying yes right away, she wants to go to dinner to talk about it.  So I have to wait until 7:30 before I can find out, and I'm no good with waiting.  I love her.  This is scary... I've never lived with a girl before -- well, that's not true, I live with Marcia, my landlady, but she's dating my roommate, so it doesn't really count.

      So I just got back from my test.  Yes, we had to do a lot of line integrals and a lot of Green's theorem (which, by the way, for those of you who were wondering does  not  have an extra E at the end).  Here's the Unger Computing Center, where I took the test:      And here's the view I had upon leaving:      And this is what I looked like, immediately after being released from the above building:       As you can see, it was an exciting day.  I'm now going to cram as much information about probability as I can into my head: I've got my last exam tomorrow!  Then I'll be free for like 6 days, at which point I'll be returning to the daily grind of PHY205.  Okay, so Marcia just called to make sure that I had the poster boards that Jose didn't use for the Big Meeting decorations.  They cost $.77 each, and I think I have three of them.  So I've got to go return them and get a full refund!

      In a few minutes, I'm going to head out to explore the realm of the great Test.  You know, as soon as I get done with these great Tests, I won't be posting here as much.  That's me -- when I've got shit that's very important to do, well... if you don't know all about it, then get off the computer and go invent something!  Green's theorem basically states that the contour integral i[P dx + Q dy] over the region C = ii[dq/dx - dp/dy] over some domain.  He might have an extra E at the end of his name.  We'll never know.  What else -- oh, I made a website and then I trashed it and then I made another one.  The initial website came to a grinding halt when I tried to put a submission form on one of the pages.  My server and I didn't get along, and we couldn't work things out, so I decided to compromise and not confuse myself further.  The Newt's name is Minute (pronounced my noot).  Let me show you a picture:      That's Carissa's hand.  We don't think it's going to live much longer: it certainly doesn't seem to be very excited about life.  We feed it live crickets.  It all feels very white trashy.  Perhaps I'm just returning to my roots...  Well, it's time to take a shower.  This is what I look like after I shower:      (Just kidding... that's not even my tongue!)

      Right now I'm studying for my final multivariable exam.  I'm about to start working on Jacobians (for change of variable integration).  I remember learning about them in class -- we went over an heuristic proof as to why they worked, and I enjoyed it, but in practice, I don't remember how to use them.  Ah, but I do remember that they are invariant under rotation!  So anyway, I also took my final today for Elizabethan Lit, which was fun.  She gave me an A on my final paper, which was exceptional: I definitely whipped that thing out of my ass while sitting at Starbucks.  Who doesn't sit at Starbucks with a laptop?  It's the latest rage.  And if only I had a T-Mobile phone, I'd be able to ... well, I don't want to go there, if you know what I mean.  Of course you don't.  Anyway, what else -- obviously, I'm just procrastinating.  Hector has called me many times today.  I told him that it was possible to read about his son on the Internet, and this struck him as fascinating.  He asked me to take a picture of the Internet and show it to him.  I love that guy.  His son is a well known artist.  The two of them don't speak (his son doesn't answer Hector's calls).  Oh, I got a call from my good old friend Billy H a few hours ago -- he's up in New York, working for an advertising firm.  He's just gotten an apartment in Brooklyn (on the good side, parallel with mid-town), and he's excited about that.  His roommate is a guy he met in London.  I'm going to be in a movie!  I'll even have a speaking role.  And yes, it's actually a real movie movie -- it's not a super release type thing that is expected to actually earn a lot of money, but I think it's going to be in theaters.  More details later.  Also, I'm going to Greece for the Olympics.  That's very exciting news -- I think I'll be going for about a week.  My summer session ends on August 6th.  Carissa won't be able to come with me, because her new job is going to keep her in Miami without real vacation time for about six months.  Hey, I just realized -- when I do all of these things, I can write about them.  Okay, my girlfriend is telling me to get off (she's my study alarm), so I gotta get back to work.

      It just bites the big one that I can't get up on time!  That's the biggest problem in my life today (ain't it grand?)  I tried to get up before 11 today, but I couldn't face the world.  There's something strange about getting up, isn't there?  Some people have no problem doing it; others spend their entire lives struggling against the alarm clock.  I love the way morning feels one I'm in it, but getting myself to be in it is a real pain.  Maybe I'll turn this website into my very own personal Sleep Diary  urlLink [The National Sleep Foundation] .  That way, anyone who stumbles across it will be utterly captivated, I'm sure.  Example:  10:41 pm - unusual leg movement 11:13 pm - crashing sound woke me up, cat knocked over banjo 02:14 am - anxiety dream woke me up 06:09 am - bird chirping woke me up 06:14 am - DAMN BIRDS 07:02 am - alarm clock  Great idea, isn't it?  Check out this sleep journalists decent into the world of Nyquil:  urlLink [Bobo's Log] .   urlLink [Final Exams from Hell] ... everybody loves 'em.  By the way, have any of you heard of James Kibo Perry  urlLink [Kibo's official site] ?  He's one of the more amusing characters out there.  The lengths that people will go to achieve fame!  I wouldn't know anything about that.

      Hello.  Okay, so about me.  Anyway, I just got back from helping Hector out.  His lights had turned off, and he was a bit scared.  I went over there with a bright little lantern, and we sat around while FPL replaced the fuse on the power line.  A possum had zapped itself.  I looked at the possum -- he was lying dead beneath the powerlines.  He didn't look too good (his eyes were burned out).  Life, it happens, then it doesn't.  Tonight we had the "meeting" -- "Young at Heart".  This is probably the meeting's first reference on the web!  If you're ever in the Miami area and you're a Friend of Bill, show up at the Coral Room (it's right by LeJeune and US1) at 7:30 on Any Given Sunday and check us out.  We're cool.  So I headed over there with Jose (he's that funny guy), Adam (he's that dramatic but very nice guy), Will (he's the young one), and Jimmy ('Jimmy the Leg').  We had a nice get together, and then we broke -- I took them back to their respective houses (well, Adam went off with this girl), and I rented Peter Pan.  Peter Pan -- that was for my girlfriend.  She's awesome, but damn, she's an Evil Black Monster of the Deep (hereafter EBMD) this time of the month (TTOTM).  She wanted to watch it, but by the time I finally got home, it was 11:30, and she had to sleep.  She's one of those people who work in the morning.  So I was sitting here writing a different blog (my blogs shall not co-mingle, so I shall not mention its name here) when Hector called.  I didn't  really  want to go out there, but I was so happy I did, because it's always rewarding to do those things that I don't want to do.  Earlier, I don't recall.  Oh, yes!  It was mother's day (hi mom!).  We went over to a great restaurant on the beach.  It's not really a restaurant, it's more of a sandwich shop of sorts -- or rather, a sandwich stand.  But they make the best prosciutto and mozzarella sandwiches this side of wherever they make them really well.  So good.  Liked that, and so did she.  We had a nice chat over at Starbucks afterward, and then she went home.  She told me she was lonely.  That broke my heart.  I love her, but it's so hard to express that, being a 23 year old male who is generally incapable of showing emotion.  So this is my blog, and I can write just as much as I damn well please.  I don't have to worry about a comedic sense of timing on here: I can't rattle on all night for all I care, and there's not a damn thing you can do about it (NADTYCDAI).  Thank God for spellcheck.  Earlier, earlier, grinding the wheels all the way back to the morning -- rolled out of bed at 11:30-ish, and I went off to tutor Pete in mathematics.  He's doing alright.  He's got his big final tomorrow (it's that time of year), and we're all rooting for him.  Hector asked me to pray for him.  The FPL guy was mighty fucking cool.  Actually, he was a major geek, but in my eyes, he was fantastic.  He put this big silver wire into this rusty tube and stuck it up on the power lines, and there was this jolt of blue light and then the thud of the air conditioners all the way up and down 14th street whirring back to life.  One day, my boy, we'll look back on all this and laugh.  And that day will be tonight.  Felt good.  Perhaps I was a bit cocky today.  Alex stuck a bunch of crap under my windshield wipers, and while driving, I littered it.  I justified that by blaming Alex for putting the crap under my wipers to begin with.  No, that was wrong.  I feel bad about it, which is enough.  Not that my feelings are any indicator of an "outward" reality; I've been told that many times.  What is an indicator of outward reality?  There's a question that has the potential to keep you rocking in bed at night for hours.  If you really think about it.  Got a call from Glenn G last night.  He said he's been broken up with his girl for about three weeks.  Girl of two and a half years!  That's longer than I've ever gone: my longest was about 19 months, and that one was a goner after about the third hour.  You gotta hate those relationships that are over before they start, but then you go and start them anyway just to see how they end, and then they last for 19 months.  What are you supposed to do with the 19 months in the middle?  Treasure the memories?  What memories?  I was too drunk to remember most of it.  God, I've been an asshole.  I'm not sure if I feel bad about it, or think it's funny.  I'll probably feel bad about it tomorrow.  Well, maybe not.  After all, tomorrow never comes.  I'm gonna have to figure out how to refine this spew at some point, otherwise nobody's going to read it.  Damn you, comedic timing!  You are my nemesis.  Love it, Rob

      Hi.  My name is Rob, and I'm an alcoholic.  I've been saying that for two years -- since March 11, 2002.  That is my life.  I was in college before -- in the northeast.  Then I came down south, where my family lives, to get sober.  I did it at a great hospital -- detoxed for 9 days, stayed in the residence there for three months, and then they released me.  For the first six months after I got out, I worked -- for a friend's dad.  It was a friend I'd met in rehab, and the dad was the CEO of a mid-sized company.  It was a good gig for me, paid ten bucks an hour, and I enjoyed it for a time.

      I may have gotten a new job today.  For those of you who don't know, I'm a student at the University of Miami and I moonlight as a math tutor.  The new job: well, let's just say the title is "monitor".  Those of you on the in with the lingo might know what I'm talking about; otherwise, just imagine a small, gated community that caters to very wealthy people with a specific malady.  That's right: I'll be working for a hospital of sorts!  It'll be a good job, because I'll get paid to do what I do already.  Lots of socializing involved, not too much stress.  Hopefully it'll supplement the school and tutoring nicely, although it sounds like it's going to add a lot of sheer hours to my days.  The job came out of nowhere.  A friend called, and asked if I was making enough money tutoring.  I told him I'd always be happy to make more, he gave me a phone number to call, and viola, it happened like that.  I'm indebted to The Israeli once again.  The last time was for the prosciutto -- now it's for a position in the residence!  Well, we'll see.  Everything is temporary and nothing is certain, so I might as well not get ahead of myself.  I start my next battery of summer classes tomorrow: it's physics with a lab.  I'm not excited about it, because Mondays and Wednesdays will be 10am - 4pm days.  That really doesn't sound like a good way to spend the summer -- but I no longer deserve a summer, as I'm 23 years old.  Anyway, it's the middle of the night and I just remembered I have to cancel a camera order.  I placed an order for a new camera for Carissa, but it appears that her warranty is going to cover it after all (see the beginning of "The Fire of '04").  I'm going to try to figure out if this can be done; otherwise, it appears that I'll be getting a camera too!  That's good: I need one.  I miss taking photos for this blog.

       "Warning: Terrorists may use floating bombs"   Are they serious?  What planet do we live on?  There are like seven channels on cable devoted to spreading ways in which we might get attacked.  That's so pathetic -- why don't we all go out and eat a few McDonald's hamburgers and forget about it.  I'm so sick of this bullshit.  Our Fear-Driven Economy: three out of seven commercials on one break during the Rush Limbaugh show suggested we'd die young unless we bought some product.  "Cortislim: The Scientific Centerpiece of your Healthy Exercize Regiment".  "Today, Iraq will be reborn".  "Farmer kills neighbor in property dispute".  "Insurgency".  "Iraqi Military".  "One pill a week can help reverse bone loss".  "I'm in a seven-forty fizzai".  What a country.  Yet I reap the benefits!  Yet, what are the benefits?  What makes me happy?  A nice place to live?  A computer?  A job?  School?  God is sufficient in disposal of affairs.

      The other night, I was out on the balcony with my girlfriend, Carissa.  We were enjoying the scenery – the Rickenbacker Causeway which leads to Key Biscayne, and glimpses of the city shrouded in the sunset light.  My apartment is oriented in such a way that from it’s balcony, I can see the edge of downtown, but the skyscrapers in the center of the city are hidden from view.  The building across the way from me is under construction, and its balconies have a clear view of downtown.  It just so happened that on this night, several guys were working on a balcony that was almost even with mine.  They were rough looking Hispanic guys – until the explosions started wracking the evening, I’d hardly noticed them.  It was sudden: downtown was echoing with the cracking, booming sound of heavy explosives.  After a few moments, the construction workers across the way began to shout:  “Hey, the building is on fire!”  They looked at me and gestured wildly towards downtown.  “I can see explosions!”  Terrorists.  I knew it.  I started scanning the sky for stray airplanes.  I could see a huge plume of smoke pealing out of downtown, orange lights flickering inside it.  Shit.  I turned to Carissa, and said: “We’ve got to get out of this building.  Quick, put your shoes on.”  I ran into the living room.  My roommate, Brad, was in the bathroom, taking a shower.  “Brad,” I shouted.  “Get the fuck out of the shower!”  “Why?”  “Because I said so, damn it!  Get out right now!”  I wasn’t holding back: this was my moment.  I was going to direct us all to safety.  I was born for this very instant.  It all became so clear.  “What’s going on?” Brad asked.  I could hear the shower water still running.  I was infuriated – couldn’t he tell I was trying to save his life?  Didn’t he understand that by wasting precious moments forcing me to convince him that it was necessary to get out of the shower, he was putting all our lives in jeopardy?  “Get the fuck out of the shower,” I screamed.  “I’ll explain it to you in a minute.”  Carissa had her shoes on, she handed me mine.  I slipped them on and waited a moment.  Then, I decided I was going to be a true hero.  “You go down,” I said to Carissa.  “Don’t wait for us.”  She nodded and headed out the door with Pooka, our Chihuahua.  I went back on the balcony, waiting for Brad.  I called to the construction workers.  “Is the building still burning?”  They ignored me.  Strange.  A moment later, Brad stepped out of the bathroom, in his boxers.  “What’s going on?” he asked.  I explained, briefly, that we were under attack by terrorists and I didn’t have any more details.  He nodded.  “Okay then,” he said, and went back into the bathroom to put his clothes on.  Then, like an angel from beyond, Carissa re-appeared in the doorway, bearing a message.  “The guy down the hall says it’s fireworks,” she said.  “Fireworks?  But they said it was on fire,” I said, pointing to the construction workers.  “I think they were messing with you, Rob,” Carissa said.  And like that, my moment of glory was snuffed out – I became the fool.  There were no terrorists.  I went back out onto the balcony and looked again – a puff of firework smoke was drifting off towards the horizon, carrying my dreams of being hero away into the sunset.

      I saw the Chronicles of Riddick today.  I intended to use my these two free movie passes I got about two years ago -- they expire on 6/30/04.  But there's a catch: Riddick came out in the last two weeks, so it's some sort of special event.  In other words, the free tickets aren't any good.  But I don't think this movie's going to make it past the two week mark: straight to video, that's what I say!  I'm reading  urlLink Dune .  Obsessed with it, in fact.  I want to be Paul Maud'Dib.

      It's 2004, right?  I can't remember.  So I got a little bored with the blog.  I destroyed Carissa's camera on her birthday, so no more pictures for now.  Go-Karts and cameras, who would have thought they don't go together?  Damn you, Jimmy.  So, the fire.  Last night, I was in my new apartment, lounging in the bedroom.  It was about 11:30.  Carissa was over, and we were just chatting.  Suddenly, my roommate started banging on the door.  I felt a wave of irritation: roommate, intruding at 11:30 at night, this doesn't bode well.  I started to answer, and he just thrust his head right in.  Bastard, I thought.  "There's a fire in the apartment next door," he said.  Aha!  Redemption for the roommate.  I leapt out of bed and dashed into the living room.  There was smoke pouring in off the balcony.  "Shit," I said.  He told me to go outside and take a look -- and I did.  There was smoke, tinted with orange flames, billowing off the next door balcony.  This was not good.  I walked back inside, remarkably calm, and went to the front door.  I checked to see if the doorknob was hot (I've seen that in movies).  It wasn't, so I opened the door.  The hallway had smoke in it, but there was no sign of fire, and no heat.  I went back inside, barged into my bedroom, and yelled at Carissa: "Get up!"  She was already up and dressed, and a bit irritated at my presumption --  "Do you think, if there's a fire, that I'm not going to get up?", she asked.  "Well, we have to go," I said.  I grabbed my backpack and headed for the door.  "Don't you want to take your wallet, too?" she asked.  "Yes," I said, and grabbed my wallet, keys, and cell phone.  Then I headed back for the door.  It was then that the fire alarm began to blare.  An unearthly Spanish-accented voice intruded over the siren: "There is a fire in the building.  Everyone must leave.  Please, everyone exit the building."  Backpack and wifebeater on, I headed for the front door, ready to guide my roommate and girlfriend to safety.  A new voice came on over the alarm: "This is not an emergency, I repeat, this is not an emergency.  There is no fire.  Some people on the 25th floor were having a barbecue on the balcony.  There is no emergency."  We all started to laugh.  Security was already outside, interrogating our next door neighbors.  And we were safe.  The fire alarm continued, intermittently, late into the night.  My roommate was the one who pulled the fire alarm, by the way.  I think it was entirely justified: however, I do not view this as a good public relations move, vis-a-vis our next door neighbors.

       Tomorrow is Carissa's birthday.  We've reached the point where she is no longer advertising her age.  She is currently reliving her highschool experience by reading  urlLink The Perks of Being a Wallflower  (TPBW).  TPBW is actually a surprisingly good book.  She read some of it aloud to me last night.  There was some depth, and some extraordinary insite.  I'm going to go shopping for Carissa's birthday gifts today.  I've got many ideas, but I haven't had time to put any of them into action.  I definitely want to treat her like a princess tomorrow.  Girls really want to be treated like princesses.   urlLink Friendster  continues to amaze me.

       Darah is helping me move.  Moving is a stressful experience.  Before Darah came to my rescue, I was taking peeks into my bedroom and weeping.  There was crap scattered everywhere: clothes littered the floor, cables were overflowing from tupperware boxes, books were hanging from the ceiling.  It was overwhelming.  Darah is going to go to hospitality school soon.  She's like a personal organizer, except she's free, and not made of plastic.  She comes over and she starts directing me: go there, throw this away, I said  throw it away !  I love it.  I must've gotten rid of half my clothes, three quarters of my shoes, most of my old papers.  It was like getting a life enema.  That desire to cling to the old junk is weak.  Reminiscing is really just foolish sentiment -- living in the moment is way more fulfilling.  So most of my stuff is now in boxes.  All that's left are some pictures on the walls and a clown wig.  The movers are coming at 8:30 on Monday morning.  This weekend is also Carissa's birthday, so tomorrow I'm going to figure out a way to get to Grand Prix Racerama.  I actually had a birthday at Grand Prix once.  I was nine.  Life is a golden shower of glittering gifts.

       Labia jewels and all, trapped in my beard. Rocking around on the internet is turning into an addiction.  I haven't been this interested in fame in years, but when you start to rediscover old friends, that desire kicks in: the burning yearning to be incredibly famous... the "did you hear what  Rob Barry  did?" syndrome.  I think it comes from having a well known dad.  I mean, I'm sure everyone wants to be famous (unless they're spiritually connected), but I  really  want recognition sometimes.  I love that I know that!  Why else would I write a blog?  My internet soiree today led me to Ridley Pearson, and I suddenly remembered that he used to date Richard Dreyfuss's ex-wife.  That reminded me of a certain girl who I knew.  A stunning girl, really, even at 11.  I was 14.  So I searched the internet, and discovered that she still exists.  Not only does she exist, but everything I found about her mentioned that she has a lot of sex.  Now that was amusing.  Pooka gets spayed tomorrow.  She's excited -- we're cleaning the house tonight so she can come home and just relax. The point is to do the most with the least doing being done.

      We can't help but wonder, what's the point?  The point is that we are willing to grow along spiritual lines.  What does that mean, anyway?  I'm growing.  I can't stop growing.  They say, "if you aren't moving forwards, you're moving backwards".  Well -- I ask them this -- how the hell do I go backwards?  I suppose smoking crack would be moving backwards -- but if I were doing it, wouldn't I still be growing?  The point is, don't ask so many stupid questions.  Okay.  Car broke down today, but that was cool because DMX gave me a jump.  I gave him two dollars -- one before my car even broke down, and one after he fixed it.  He wanted beer.  Not the real DMX.  Well, he wasn't a fake DMX, but he wasn't exactly  The DMX  either.  He wasn't wearing a shirt.  His tattoo was "DMX".  What does that  mean ?  Don't ask so many stupid questions.  My dog likes to eat Kleenex.  Especially after I've used it.  Seamus told me he wanted to travel the world today.  I said, "Seamus, you're 17.  Give it time."  In my heart, I said, "Go!  Run!  Explore the universe, my friend, before you are old and broken and dead."  None of that is true, except for what Seamus said.  Except his name isn't Seamus.

      I don't think I'll be able to post here as often for the time being.&nbsp;  Work and school  are taking up far too much of my time.  There are more things to life then being  a famous internet bloggist .&nbsp; We all need to step back and remember that once in a while.

      If there is one thing I want in life, it's a large poster of Srinivasa Aiyangar Ramanujan.  You think I'm kidding.      "An equation means nothing to me unless it expresses a thought of God," he said, and he meant it.  In response to G.H. Hardy's comment that "1729 was a dull number," Ramanujan replied:  "No, it is a very interesting number; it is the smallest number expressible as a sum of two cubes in two different ways."  In other words, 9^3 + 10^3 = 1729 and 12^3 + 1^3 = 1729.  I don't know if Ramanujan was born with extra circuitry, or if he was just a very good guesser, but based on the output of his work, I would definitely hypothesize the former.  He came up with a bunch of new ways to express various transcendental numbers -- let me show you an example, taken from  urlLink MathWorld 's website:      I don't know how he did that.  Do you?

      It finally happened.  The other day, my friend Eric invited me to Orkut.  Eric is a real computer type of guy: I've known him since I was 13.  He was a fellow fan of my father's writing, and he hosted what's called a "BBS".  That stands for  B ulletin  B oard  S ystem.  "High school is like the training wheels for the bicycle of life."   Now, for important things: this.  Many of you have been coming to me and asking, "What's the deal with Soul Patch, Rob?"  To them, I say this:  The Soul Patch is an essential ingredient to many varying facial hair structures.  For instance, it is integral to  The Flying W , which is pictured below.   Okay, I thought there could be more fun there, but it really got old fast.  Apparently, The Soul Patch is not as funny as it sounds.  But let me say that I am indebted to  urlLink Creep Guirdo  and his little friend  urlLink jose .  I call him little because he doesn't capitalize his name.  Carissa is watching  urlLink Ghost World  with the dark but mildly good looking  urlLink Thora Birch .  You probably remember her from her masterful performances as Sally Ryan in the Tom Clancy blockbusters  Patriot Games  and  Clear and Present Danger .  So back to Eric.  On BBSess there were "sysops" --  sys tem  op erator s .  I was one of them, but before that, Eric was.  And I chatted with him for several days (or possibly weeks) about the traumas of being 13, and I think he was very understanding.  "That says so much about who I am, and what it feels like to inhabit my specific skin."

      I slept through class this morning.  I woke up at around nine, and started hitting snooze.  Somehow, I managed to snooze it until it was 9:48am: class starts at 10:05, and I just said, "fuck it," and went back to sleep until now.  I stayed up until 3 last night.  Do you know what I was doing?  I was playing this video game that Carissa bought called Black & White: Creature Isle.  It's an entertaining game -- you get to be God.  Today I'm going to the optometrist, tutoring Noelle in physics, finding a speaker for the 5:30, and running with Carissa.  Tonight -- who knows.  Shit.  I really do feel out of sorts.  I shouldn't skip class, it's just not worth it.  If I were in class, I'd be feeling bored but fine, and I'd only have 27 minutes left.  As it is, I feel very jittery.  But why?  I can do the work: I don't need to be there to understand.  The professor doesn't care if I show up or not.  Yesterday, I went with my girlfriend to see her therapist.  I don't usually endorse couples' therapy: it smacks of overpriced anger management courses for two.  But this wasn't like that -- I was going to support her in an adventure she was involved with.  Her therapist is a totally cool guy -- except that he's (a) pretty good looking, and (b) really smart.  But he's married.  Supposedly.  He works out of his house.  I didn't see his wife.  He kept talking about gay.  Gay is a fun subject to talk about, though.  Will & Grace, for example.  They get a whole TV show.  The jokes go like this:   Grace : Will, you're so gay.  Will : I know!  I just have gay rubbed all over me!  Grace : Will, that's disgusting.  Will : Mmmm hmmm... baby, you know you want this.  But you can't have it, because I'm gay!  Grace : [laughs]  That's exactly how it happens.  Every time.  Recently, I told you that someone called me metrosexual.  Well, it now appears that it is "in" to be metro: I don't know when that happened.  I mean, Bush is president and he's a borderline neo-con born again Christian, so the cool vibes definitely aren't emanating from  his  office.  But I guess we already knew that.  No, the cool vibes seem to flow down from some place north and east of Miami: England.  On November 15th, 1994, Mark Simpson, a journalist for the British media outlet  The Independent  wrote:  Some people said unkind things. American GQ, for example, was popularly dubbed ''Gay Quarterly''. Little wonder that all these magazines Â with the possible exception of The Face Â address their  metrosexual  readership as if none of them were homosexual or even bisexual.  [ urlLink The Word Spy ] It took several years for the word to really take off: it wasn't until Mark Simpson used the word again in a Salon.com article in 2002 that it gained the public recognition it deserved.  "Since then it has been picked up by thousands of media outlets, has made numerous TV appearances, has spawned at least a couple of books, and has been dropped in untold numbers of cocktail party conversations," writes The Word Spy.  Beautiful.

      It is that magical hour -- 2:14 am, when romance is sparkling across the eastern seaboard and working stiffs are asleep.  It's Wednesday night, a.k.a. Thursday morning.  I can't sleep.  There's smoke drifting around outside: the Everglades are on fire.  This has been the summer of flame for me (somebody told me I looked metrosexual tonight -- ha!)  I'm listening to Crime and Punishment, a book on tape.  Interesting note: apparently, the "crime" in Crime and Punishment translates more accurately to transgression.  I.e., he steps outside the realm of acceptable behavior, finds himself alone, and discovers that being alone is worse than being afraid.  Dostoevsky was a conservative.  I like the Edwards ticket.  If I had a chance to vote at some point thus far, I probably would have voted for Edwards, if only because he's been in politics for just six years.  That seems to me to be a major bonus.  Before that: a sleaze-ball lawsuit-oriented attorney.  At least he had a job.  Kerry, bah.  John Kerry cut in front of me in line once.  I was waiting to get ski rentals, and suddenly, Kerry and two of his aides pushed me and my dad aside.  One of the aides walked up to the rental desk and said: "Senator Kerry is here for his skis".  But -- and I view this as a plus -- Kerry has never, to my knowledge, bombed a foreign country.  I don't think he even knows how to fly.   Masturbated tonight -- but don't tell anyone.  Who wants to know about that, anyway?  I bet  you  do, you sick little pervert.  Watched the Big Lebowski for a few minutes tonight.  It's not as good as it once was, but it's still a great movie.  Jesus is probably the best movie character ever concocted.  Eight year olds, dude.  Eight year olds.

      My roommate is listening to some song by Stevie Ray Vaughn that's got the lyric, "that's how it happens living life by the drop".  Time to start drinking!  I'm on a new exercise program -- I work out each day.  So far, I'm doing about two and a quarter miles on the treadmill, then 20 minutes on the exercise bike.  I don't know if this is healthy: it usually feels like my heart is about to explode at least three times during my regiment.  Some of you are probably asking, "Rob, why are you on an exercise regiment?"  To you, I say: go ask somebody else a question, because I'm not answering you.  I'm not fat, okay?  Even if I was, I'd be a good looking fat guy.  That's what my girlfriend says.  I think she's lying, but I keep that to myself.  Except for when I publish it on this blog.  Speaking of which, my girlfriend started a blog.  It's pretty cool, but she's not interested in making it public, so I'm not going to give out the address here.  Suffice to say that if you really wanted to figure it out, you probably could.  What a mystery!   Bill Clinton just isn't that good looking, either.  Girls say he's "hot" -- I don't see why -- he looks like a semi-sleazy used car salesman.  He's got that earnest, "I'm concerned with your values" type of face.  It's scary that I think of Clinton as being a stable, upstanding president.  The current one -- well, I'm frequently afraid for my life.  Just read some of the past posts.  A little neurotic, you say?  Humbug.

       I'm going to Greece today, and boy am I excited.  As long as the plane that's supposed to get me there doesn't crash, I plan to have an excellent time.  Technically, I don't know what I'm going to do when I get there, but the way I see it, things like that take care of themselves.  Of course, I'm going to be there during the Olympics.  I plan to attend Chariot Racing, Pankration, and the Pentathlon.  Go USA!  I'll be the guy wearing the red, white, and blue.  I'll have an enormous bumper sticker on my ass that says: "Bush / Cheyney '04 and Forever!".  No, seriously, this'll be good.  It'll give me a chance to experience the international flavour.  I haven't been out of North America and it's Islands since 9/11.  I've heard a lot about how much everyone would like to shove it to us, but I've yet to experience it first hand, and that's what life is all about.  Maybe I'll take a notebook, and pretend to be a journalist.  That way, if I get kidnapped, I can tell them I'm a reporter, and they'll spare me.  As it stands, I've got no chance: I'm no Canadian diplomat!  Anyway, I'm doing some laundry right now, trying to figure out if I have enough clothes to last me through the trip, etc.  Pre-trip stuff.  Always exciting.
