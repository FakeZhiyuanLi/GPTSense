       urlLink    FANTASIA BARRINO.   As we all know the show 'american idol' have been the most watch tv show this past few months even in brunei too..agree? the winner of the american idol 2004 is fantasia barrino..   Simon Cowell called Fantasia Barrino's final performance during Tuesday's "American Idol" competition her "acceptance speech," but it was her actual acceptance speech Wednesday that will forever be remembered.  After a long embrace with runner-up Diana DeGarmo, and with tears rushing down her face, the raspy 19-year-old singer looked at host Ryan Seacrest and declared, "I broke my shoe!''  The finalists from season three (minus Matt Rogers and Leah LaBelle) will spend their summer on the "American Idol" tour (see "Don't Expect To Hear 'She Bangs' On This Year's 'Idol' Tour"), but you can bet Fantasia and Diana DeGarmo won't be the only ones sneaking in studio time and auditions.   ~congrats to fantasia~  ~sR~
