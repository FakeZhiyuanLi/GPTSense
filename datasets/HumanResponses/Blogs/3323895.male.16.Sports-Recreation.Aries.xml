         This band needs to never die, and they should live on forever to let everyone know that heart is not better. Honestly I think that alittle old rock is ok everytime it's needed, but then I couldn't listen to it all the time. WOW, this is really short maybe I will add on later.....

        Sometimes I wonder my life is worth living or if I just lab rat in one of gods twisted experiments...... I honestly think that he's picking on me for everything I do, I think people just have more fun than me because they don't have a clue what really is going on in the world, it's not just a giant game it's a test for those who seek knowlegde of the highest. I don't know why I even try everything I do has no effect on the people or things around me. (I'm so not making scenes at all). I think I may have a problem, but it is the most unimagineable "spit" you can think of. Honestly my life is just one big shit whole if you now what I mean!!!! I wonder what life would be like if I had never met patsy or if had never been born, it may be alot better then it is now. Nobody even tells me what the hell is going on and I feel like I'm drifting away from everyone who knows me or even said hello. Wow myhell hold for a life is really starting to take its toll. In church I feel as if I have no reason to even go, all I do is sk8 and sometimes make out with my girlfriend.  Life is hell in a hand basket. See I have to more problems than anyone I know and my life is shit.  Later I'm so ucking out of this mess.

         I honestly think E is waiting just alittle too long to ask joey out and it is really starting to bug me. If you have any comments on what is happening with E & joey then send me a comment, okay.  But, seriously they are all over each other and E kissed joey and I think that sparked something, yeah.  Ok what will happen if joey is leading her on and doesn't really like her, I think I would kick his butty and never let him play wades guitar again. So what would you do?? SEND, SEND, SEND!!!!!   Alrighty then what shallest we gossip about next so much to talk about so little time. Let's talk about the evil elfs in the walls and only come out when you are sleeping to ravage your teddy bears until they can no longer speak to you when you have your little conversations about private things, but everybody now that when you tell one person or thing then everybody else finds out...........

           I wonder how many hours you have to spend to learn how to play guitar and whether you have to kill your life. Some people I see play guitar know every song for every band and that makes me feel like I'm a person who knows too little and that's where I'm Not Worhty comes in. I would not spend all day inside learning how to play guitar and get every song memorized down to every note. That is phyco groupie cocaine crazy, yeah. These people include "joey" hint, hint. I live for one thing and one thing only to have as much fun as humanly possible. kewl huh!!  Having friends that can play guitar alot better than you isn't a good thing sometimes. You always wish you were as good as the person your watching bust a phaty solo. Then jealousy sets in and you start to think that the person is just trying to show off to score pionts with some gurl(s) or just show how good he is.

         What is darkness?? How does it effect the world and others around it???      Why does the #666 have to be a satanic symbol, it's just a number to a sane man like me. I think all this stuff is just an excuse to not believe in the "BIG GUY", most of the people I hang out with don't like slipknot and all their doing is acting like their into dark powers, but when they die who are they going to pray for?? exactly(the"BIG GUY"). Sooner or later people are going to become tired of the way they live and realize that their is a better life on the other side, a life of happiness, love, and all around holesum fun with what they live for. So if your one of those people who believe in satan then sooner or later you will come to now the"BIG GUY" and how much he loves everyone and how he forgives you for all that you do(anything). So how about your life with the "BIG GUY"? are you walking the right way or are you on both sides of the fence?????

         How would a life guard feel if you told him that his speedos were off season?? A good question to ask a true life guard, but thid the middle of the desert and their are no beachs, the only bodies of water are small lakes on either side of hicksville. Ok, one thing I don't get is y gurls have to go to the bathroom in a group this is one of the great mysteries of life and what guys don't need to know unless they really have to.  I mean honestly what do they do in there??? Men on the other hand just bleed the lizard or drop the kids off at the pool and get out. What is wrong with women these days...

Yes(other person)lets haer more bout Wade. Well, I know that Eli Likes "joey" also and that's alittle strange.

Answer in a comment.. What do think the future would be like. Well in the future dinners come in pill form, spandex will be the best clothing and the world will be ruled by darn dirty(English Accent)apes.!! some people have no respect for the mentally challenged dwarfs that live in my room and honestly I've learned to like how they talk smack to people and pick on my sibling.

            What is life, but a giant game and if played correctly all will succeed, but yet if played poorly you shall strive to pull ahead. Every beginning has its end. If you choose the wrong way to play then you had better be ready to accept what you unleashed. We will all take it back, yet we have to make a life that fits us. What some people don't understand is life is hard and unpredictable. Our world has come to this, what are you going to do? Yet some people ask why other beings don't change, but one person can only do so much when they have to. All our sentences have been served, we are free to go, but no one understands that life is truly cruel. People see nothing of what is happening. Every one falls sooner or later, not only is it hard, but you learn so much from mistakes or problems. To over come all this pain is impassible, your alone as long as you travel this road of torment and saddness. Pain, to some people is just a word to others it's a way of life, but yet again no one cares and that is what the world is all about, everyone is so determined to live life the way their way and yet never see the true picture or illustion.  When life has its ups and downs then you realize the true meaning of life. Some take awhile, but quickly see every thing. The end has to start a new beginning.                    P.S. this is my final thought

              What is this?? Why have we hesitated to ask these questions? And yet no one says anything about what they know or how it all ends.  These are some of the questions that I will ask if any. Lies are everywhere and yet again no one says nothing.... WHAT HAVE I DONE TO ASK THESE QUESTIONS

         But yet everything has something to talk about. That brings me to my confusion. What has people talking for hours about? So as life we know it could be one big ball of dreams that we can never wake up from. Every action has something to be warned. Certain people have conceived the plans or ideally contemplated about being told about nothing that will come to be. I know I probably don't make any sense at all so I will continue. This is the way it goes, so punish my thoughts and unscrew my head and rinse it clean. Why do people go after what they don't understand?????????  If I have struck a chord here and you feel my words are inlightful then tell me what you think, and if not then still tell me what you think.............
