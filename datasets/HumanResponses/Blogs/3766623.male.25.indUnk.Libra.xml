      [ek aashu chupake rakhatha...  woh bhi nikal jayegi] when I’ll face you next time. But... In the chaotic circles of my existence you’ll find rivulets of LOVE with a common destination. Despite the highschool-ish vacuous prattles you’re more of a woman now and it seems you’re already learned the grown-up game of love denial.  aBig congratulation! I’ll return ur photos... when I’ll meet you next time.

       "If all the engagement ring says is ‘together till something better turns up,’ you may as well buy a goldfish." : Flic Everest  You’re not the first to say YES [...when you say YES to Bijon Mohanty though, you know, he don’t want you as much as marriage itself] because saying NO would be hideous. Also, you’re not the first to say NO [...when you touched me and swore: No...I don’t love you] because you’re committed and you believe, to stick to your commitment is a good thing, no matter what happen in the future.  One thing is for sure, if it isn’t right, a ring on your finger won’t make it better. But some women are so keen on the idea of marriage they’ll convince themselves their man would be the perfect fiancé, despite all the evidence to the contrary. Getting engaged isn’t a matter of celebration or so-called good news, more a matter of shifting plants and reorganizing your CDs. Of course, you may be delighted to be engaged. Maybe you can’t think of any better way to get rid of me. Basically, if you get engaged, you’re intending, at some point, to get married. And if you don’t know each other well enough, or aren’t sure enough about each other, to fix the date or to book the venue [most provably, again, that OAS association] should you be promising eternal devotion in the first place?

      Read this. It’s it interesting that...people smile even when they really want to cry. So I smile. Remember that song: [tum itina jo muskura rahe ho...]  "We are hollow men; we are stuffed men...headpieces filled with straw. Alas! Our dried voices, when, we whisper together, are quiet and meaningless..." : T. S. Eliot There is no reason why one should disagree with T. S. Eliot. There are times when, for most of us, our self is like a garb, something we keep changing on different occasions. Hypocrisy is the order of the day, when even the devil can cite the scriptures for his requisite purposes. We constantly wear a mask for the world, a mask that ensures us a place, a belonging and acceptability to the world. And more often then not, our real self gets lost behind the mask. So miserably lost, that finding it again is near impossible. And even if we should find it, we’d better keep it under wraps, for it won’t be a pleasant experience for us to face our conflicting selves together.  So also I lost my real self...unfortunately. So also, like some millions or billions, you lost your real self. You’ve been using me as excuse to mask your own secret feelings and fear. You’re some sort of emotional stowaway. It’s not fair to either of us. It’ll lead us to nowhere. It can neither make you my friend nor my... "Good news for you." You said on the phone. It wouldn’t take a Nostradamus to figure what good news you’re talking about. My heart skipped a beat. "mo engagement thik hei jauchi..." And, you call it a good news?  What a joke...rubbish...bullshit.  But, under that transparent veil of I-me-myself syndrome, I could see the real YOU...the real ZENY...my sweetheart.

      [tu kaheinki mo sahita misuchu, kahilu...?  mu tote dukha chada kichiii debini]  Those words were really intoxicating. When you told me those things in that juice shop, I felt a tight knot forming in my stomach, and my throat constricted. You’re going to leave me...the thought itself was enough. Yet, the language of your expression thrilled me... You suggest me to forget you.  Why?  How can I?  I’m not just another RDfront lover boy, another womanizer, another eve-teaser and another biotech guy. I’m not up to just to attract your attention. I love you...and, it’s a REAL one...it’s from the core of my heart.  Can’t you see that? How can I forget you? Why don’t you forget Bijon Mohanty...or, make him your brother? No...I can’t forget you. No...I won’t compromise, not at least, with the issues involving my life. I’ve made my choice and I know it’s attainable...therefore; my choices are not and never would be limited or stilted. Before, I met you, may be. But, not now. You’ve changed my life forever. I’m not going to settle for anything less. And, why am I so mad? No reason, just my happy nature. It was always there but I discovered it after you came into my life. I’d wished to bring you into my life, make you my wife. But... How often do people get what they really want? Is it possible? Is it possible on my part? It’s hard to believe, except for one thing:  ZENY did never make me unhappy.

      Months had passed since I had first met you. For me, it had been an astonishing relationship that was utterly unlike any that I had ever known before - mainly of course, because of the unbelievable matching of our mentality and chemistry. My feelings for you are rooted in the fact that you’re just like a demure damsel who lack a proverbial ‘salt’ element in her character; you’re in the sheer enjoyment of your spontaneity; your quick humor; your beauty still not fully formed; your flowering personality that, for all your easy chatter, was often hesitant, often vulnerable. In your feelings for me, you’re generous, eager to please me, but your capacities, your depths of feeling have not yet been reached...you’re simple...typically simple. Just like a child or, can I say...just like Goodly?!??!! Oh! I can’t forget that... [ikki chikki chikita] Perhaps they’re the mumblings of ‘nanhisi-pyaarisi’ Goodly. But when you try to imitate her, stretching your body upward and making little yipping noises...you look intrinsically endearing and desirable.  That really needs a video clip.  That is something that makes me go weak in the knees.

      17th Feb. 2004 The University campus round me, the world, and everything else ceased to exit and there was only she...my darling, my little love, my precious...when I asked her for a minute to give her my V-day gift, though I couldn’t give it on V-day. "What’s this?" she asked. "Just a gift." "But..." "No ifs and buts." I was persistent. "Can I open the wrap?" "No...no...not here." "After all, what is this?" "Jogger’s Park." "But...I couldn’t give you anything." She complained and I felt an enigmatic coyness in her voice. "That’s not the matter." I said and walked back swiftly. My spasmodic breathings were gone by then. I was dreamily content, completely relaxed, and acutely aware of my strong inclination towards her. wait...wait...wait...  There was a little message slip - a Rabindra song - in the wrap with the cassette, and that read something like this:   [Your questioning eyes were sad, / they brought / sadness to my heart. / Don’t keep to yourself / the secret of your heart, my friend! / Say it to me, at least to me. / Say it to me. / My heart will hear it, not my ears. / Speak it to me through hesitating tears, / through faltering smiles, / through sweet shame and pain, / the secret of your heart! / You are my own, my own, my friend in my endless dreams! / You are my own, my own, my friend in my lonesome dreams! / You are my own, my own, my friend in my deathless dreams!]   That’s why I couldn’t give her my V-day gift on V-day. And why I chose "Jogger’s Park"...? ’coz of her name: ZENY  Understand??? hm 11:56 pm

      14th Feb. 2004 The day before yesterday matters came to an interesting twist in the library. I was working up there, or rather trying to work in spite of the outrageous capering of some very primitive elements in my brain, when she entered into the library, under a transparent pretext of looking for a book. My biological stream runs at the ratio of 10 [dus] whenever I see her. Her hair, soft, rich, luxuriant; her eyes, brimming and expectant and that smile! Man, it could blow upon Alladin’s cave. Her eyes made me feel they could reach inside my heart. And I thought: nothing else does make me feel that way inside. My ears heard, but I was too lost in the eyes that held me, too moved by my body’s response, to notice her words.  Absolute angel.  I took a deep breath, reaching for control.  ‘What’s wrong with me?’ I asked myself, with a worried frown. And within few seconds I answered my own question: ‘only that I want her too much...want to love her too much...want more than ever to give her all the pleasures of the world.’  My ugly frown smoothed to a meaningful smile. But, unfortunately, my BELOVED want nothing, except nice foods, nice sleep and nice dresses; black, pink and of course, white dresses...’coz she looks like a pari...an absolute angel, in white dresses. Oh, shit! How can I forget...today is Valentine day. But, Alas! Nothing special for me...’coz I couldn’t give her my gift. hm 11:45 pm

      If there is a GOD in the world, it's not in you or me, but in the space in between...in trying to connect. 'coz HE knows: heart's gladness is, indeed, connection. This [blog] is exclusively for you...my sweetheart. To start it from the beginning I want to extract two pages from my personal diary. Plz, let me...

       Love has only one law: make happy the person you love.  The other night God asked me: "Asked for anything..." "I want my ZENY to have a thoroughly jolly time." I asked Him.

      You are not your own master, I tell you;  I am not my own, either.  I cannot control my own destiny. But, I believe, or so they tell me, at least I think - people say I am one of the most stubborn people in the world. I act myself dizzy, puppet of a lecher’s eye; his shackles clank all around me. I fall in love to stuff my lung with icy darkness, to turn my eyes to desolate roads, to plunge my soul into lugubrious obscurity. My ascetic feet renounce these cities, their houses, and families. The path I take will not take me to you; and if I wander in gloom, it is not new. Hobnailed by fate, if these feet wobble along, it is only because the roads exist; and their destinations, which way they lead, are sweet memories and golden moments I cannot forget, until the end of time.  Can I ever forget your wet, once-and-forever eyes? Can I ever forget the glitter of your smile? Can I ever forget that endearingly mispronounced word, that makes me slave for life, that lets me know, with a deep, quiet conviction that the quest has ended, and that the journey has been worth it?  Can I ever forget you? ZENY...plz, tell me!!! I fall in love with you, just to fall.  I trace my emotions against an empty sky, let them fall away, into nothingness; and I love, love to forget this spreading emptiness.

       Yet what else but self-seeking is my passionate prayer to GOD:  Give me ZENY, or else, I die?  To all appearance, we’re soul mates, we’re meant to be together...nothing less. No other vision had ever crossed my imagination for a moment. All this time my hopes are high, not merely as to the growth of your feelings towards me, but as to the probability of winning your LOVE so as to place myself in a position to place you in such comfort, as my wife, as you’d, at least once, thought before.  It was and always will be a ‘MAGIC MOMENT’ for me when you walked into my life and, like an angel, turned my world into a fairytale of LOVE and passion unknown to mankind. ZENY...now I can’t forget you. Problem is, this is the real world and I’ll not find a soul mate ever again. Someone, who melts into my mental and physical and spiritual entity to make it a whole, a symbiotic relationship. You are, therefore I am. To lose myself completely and then to discover my soul in another entity. For me that’s what is supremely important in any viable relationship between a man and women. To hear the unspoken words, to taste the wetness of unshed tears, to feel the warmth of an unseen smile, to touch the soul even from far away.  I’ve found a reason for me...to change who I used to be...a reason to start over new and the reason is YOU. I’ve found a reason to show a side of me you didn’t know...a reason for all that I do...and the reason is YOU. I believe that, I deserve you, not least because my LOVE is rare and constant...but because, you’re so rare to me.  Each day my LOVE just grows.  You and I ’re meant to be...at least the voice say so.

      Heart's gladness is when someone, very special to you, gift you a box full of chocolates with a dazzling blue sticker affix on it.  So simple...yet, full of tender meanings. And, blank...? Yeah, really blank. And, you know what you say? You say, "Sweetheart! Plz...don't seek an excuse."  Again...  Heart's gladness is when you dial...tut-tut-tut-tut-tut-tut-tut...(dialing a seven digit number) and wander that you dialled 594 for the last three digit and 2540 for the first four digit to reach someone with a voice so nice and so cool and all at the same time so warm too.

        "In the dark, there are many secrets, waiting to be unravelled. In the dark, no questions are asked. In the dark, no answers are expected. In the dark, there is silence And the irregular, riotous beat of two hearts."   I know, your man with Bajaj Allianz is a lucky one.  But... Oneday, I'll certainly put his nose out of joint. All my dreams have a passionate masochism about them. And, the climaxes aren't always about wrecking desires in photogenic way.

       Why should a woman be criticised for following her instincts, whether it's a decision of her re-admission or it's a choice about her life partner?  To be pressurised and blacklisted for doing what your heart desires is tough. So, drop your apologies and remember, there are no hard and fast rules - you are allowed to change your mind. The most important thing is to be honest with yourself. To help you decide, find a quiet place and ask yourself these questions:  (a) If no one else was involved in anyway, what would you really do? (b) What aspects of your decision worry you and who are the people need to consider? (c) What is the worst-case scenario? And how would you deal with it? Once you've made your decision, don't allow anyone else to influence you. It's your life, and the family will come around to what makes you tick. Talk to your parents - if they're supportive, you're on a good wicket, if not, then maybe they're not worth your while in any case.
