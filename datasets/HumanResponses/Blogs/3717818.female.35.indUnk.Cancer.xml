      Here we are again...the lazy days of summer just beginning. My mind should be on picnics, beaches and sunshine. But its not. I just can't seem to stop thinking about Charlie. Aaaahhh, the color of his skin... his eyes... his wonderful demeanor... and his fat, little tail. Such joy! Charlie happens to be the newest addition to our family. He's a 3 month old leopard gecko, and we're all smitten with him. That's right - a reptile. Now, for those who know me well, they are quite astonished by this new love. Truly, I am a cat person through and through, and I own three of them just to prove it! However, I'm also a homeschooling mom of two wonderful children, one of whom has an adoration for anything with scales and forked tongues!  As any good homeschooling parent would, I tried to indulge and build on my child's interest as much as possible. Be that as it may, never did I ever imagine that I would end up with one of the scaly, little creatures living under my roof! Yet, thanks to my mother-in-law (and I mean that sincerely), the unimaginable has happened. And his name is Charlie.  Our spotted hatchling occupies a 2 foot by 2 foot terrarium, with a heated lamp. His food happens to be live crickets (yes, LIVE crickets), which also have their very own enclosure - where they are quite well fed and maintained, I might add. So, between insects and cold-blooded creatures, you can understand how I really believed I would have very little to do with the whole thing - except to make sure my daughter cared for him properly. After all, it was really supposed to be a learning experience for her, not only in being able to study a reptile and it's habits up close, but also in being responsible for her very own pet. In turn, I would lavish more love and warm-fuzzies on our three kitties to make sure they didn't feel neglected, and my son would take over the feeding of our four African dwarf frogs (but thats another story).  As the days passed, my daughter would be continually bringing me to her room to watch Charlie eat, bask in the heat lamp, and dig his tiny toes into the sand. I ended up reading a special book on the care and keeping of leopard geckos. I suddenly found myself being concerned about how much calcium he was getting in his diet, and whether or not he was having a bowel movement at least once a day. My children and I started surfing The Web for sites on leopard gecko habitats, shedding, and breeding. My dear husband would spend his lunch hour buying fresh, healthy crickets for Charlie to eat. Even the cats seemed interested in our new-comer.  One night, after everyone had gone to sleep, I silently slipped into my daughter's bedroom to watch Charlie. I sat down in a small chair right beside his tank. Everything was dark except for the red glow of his heat lamp. He heard my movements and turned his tiny head towards me. I was able to have a really good look at him without the kids and cats hovering around me. And, he was able to have a really good look at me, too. We just sat there, the two of us, staring at each other for about a minute. I noticed the striking contrast of yellow, black and lavender, on his back. Smooth, white markings framed each of his eyes, and a band of black and white spots extended from his little nostrils all the way around his head. He suddenly licked his lips and settled down in the warm sand. Apparently, he had decided I wasn't a threat. I felt privileged - no, I felt honoured to have gained the little fellow's trust. After a second he closed his eyes. He stretched out one tiny leg after the other until he was comfortable. He even stretched his toes. I was charmed and delighted by his graceful movements.   Every night thereafter, I would steal into my daughter's room once the rest of the family went to bed. For about 30 or 40 minutes Charlie and I had our private time, and each night I fell more and more in love with him. I learned (and I am still learning) more about our furless friends than I ever could have reading a textbook. I thought about my darling daughter and how, because of her, a whole new dimension had been added to my life. I thought I was the one teaching. It turns out, I was the one being taught.   Our children can enrich our lives in so many ways if only we give them the opportunity. I feel thankful towards my daughter, my teacher, for expanding my interests to include Charlie, and the rest of the reptile world.   And now, the summer has just begun..... what new things will I learn from my little teachers this season?
