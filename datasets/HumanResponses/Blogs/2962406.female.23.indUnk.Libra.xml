      I saw someone at work yesterday that I haven't seen in a very long time.  We were friends once, but I distanced myself from everyone I hung out with in high school, because for the most part, they were horrible people.  The person I saw yesterday was sort of a casualty of my breaking away from everyone.  She was the one I didn't hate.  It was awkward and unnerving and I couldn't focus the rest of my shift.  Was it because I unexpectedly saw someone from my past, or because I'm embarrassed about working retail?  A little bit of both, really.    College graduation is fast approaching, and I'm really worried I won't find a new job right away. It would be great to take time to travel or write or learn to dance or something, but alas, I cannot.  Well, I could, but then I couldn't pay my bills.  I'd really like to work at my company's home office in Ann Arbor, in the buying or marketing department.  My district manager is sort of dragging her heels on the whole thing.  Unfortunately, I didn't really think about having a Plan B.  My health insurance runs out when I finish school, so I have to find employment that provides it.  In the meantime, I need to go visit each of my doctors (eyes, teeth, etc.) before May 1.  Next month is gonna be crazy.  Strangely enough, I just ate a fortune cookie left over from last night's Thai excursion, and my fortune read "Next month shall be hectic, yet delightful."  Creepy.

      Jason and I went to see Eternal Sunshine last Sunday.  It was incredible.  Spectacular acting, great story, beautiful message.  I cannot do this movie justice with my ramblings.  With all the crap Hollywood is churning out these days, it's "nice" (if you saw the movie, you'd understand the quotation marks) to see filmmakers who care about making a quality product.  Each day since seeing it, I've fallen more in love with it.  Hell, I even appreciated the performance by Kirsten Dunst, who I normally want to toss off a bridge.  We'll probably go see Jersey Girl tomorrow, if we don't have too much homework.  We need to support Kevin Smtih on opening weekend.  I really hope for his sake, this movie doesn't blow.

      I've never lived in the city, but always in the suburbs.  Whenever I go on vacation and people ask where I'm from, I say Detroit because it's easier than explaining where my home is.  That, and it immediately puts people on edge.  Detroit has a reputation for breeding badasses, and this video is a good example of Detroit's fighting spirit.

      I read my friend Rudy's recent blog post, and I got all misty like a little bitch.  Rudy, if someone would have asked me several years ago that you would be a dear friend of mine, I don't think I would have known how to respond.  Today, I am proud and honored to call you my friend, not only for being Jason's friend, but for being someone I trust and laugh with and discuss important things with and for making Susan happy.  Susan, I know sometimes it might be weird to discuss the inner workings of personal relationships because there's the possibility of some circle jerk effect of someone telling someone telling someone else.  But I want you to know that I treasure you.  I want you to know that over the last few years, I have found myself in awe of you.  You are my friend, and I am thankful for that.  Jason.  What to say?  You know how I feel, but I probably don't say it enough.  You make the world a beautiful place and you fill me with the utmost joy.  I am privileged to wake each morning by my best friend's side.  You cheer me on and provide a shoulder to cry on and make me laugh 'til I snort and make me feel good in all the important ways.  I love you, Big Boo.  I thank some nameless god everyday that you're in my life.  Ok, cavities are developing from my saccharine outburst.

      Dear Jason (and Susan and Rudy since you guys commented as well),      I want to apologize if I worded the last post badly.  I was trying to say some people (among those, my loved ones) legitimately have problems like ADD and bipolarism (?) and depression and anxiety, but it seems like today doctors want to put EVERYONE on medications for these conditions.  It's unfair to people with these diseases because they're not treated like individuals, but rather as numbers.  I was trying to be sympathetic to those who face difficult medical conditions.  If I sounded sarcastic or disbelieving, I'm sorry.

      There's some theories going around that people who go on low carb diets like Atkins, et. al. have a tendency to become irritable and moody and display erratic behavior.  There's also some theories that this country is going fucking crazy.  Janet's nipple is being blamed for the ensuing censorship of things deemed "obscene," including Howard Strern and other DJs; a movie about Jesus is number one at the box office for a gazillion days in a row, fueling the Religious Right's agendas; Robin McGraw's getting her own talk show just cuz she fucks Dr. Phil;  the country is up in arms because gay people want to be legally recognized in their committed realtionships, and straight people are terrified of it for some reason, though I can't honestly say why; it seems like everyone and their mother are being diagnosed with anxiety of bipolar disorders or ADD or ADHD or some other problem in which doctors feel the need to medicate the masses, while people who legitimately have these medical conditions are lumped into groups of others who may just need more naps or sunlight; the people of Spain voted out the government that supported President Bush (don't even get me started on that load that should have been swallowed); Angel, which is having an amazing streak of genius episodes, will not be coming back next year.  So, what's going on?  Is this the end of civilization?    Perhaps not all hope is lost.  I have an idea: Consuming carbs may be the only way for us to regain our collective sanity.

      Just finished watching the encore presentation of "Wonderfalls" on FOX.  It was quirky and funny and interesting...so obviously it won't last longer than a season.  FOX has developed a great new show with a cute and sassy heroine and they put it's regular timeslot on Friday nights! WTF?  Hopefully it'll find an audience.  Same thing for "Arrested Development".  It's hysterical, and should be seen by all.  Jason made a good point: for as evil the FOX corporation (FOX News, Rupert Murdoch, etc.) is, they really try to develop new, different programming.  Unfortunately, they don't nurture new shows.  Instead, they give prime slots to crap like "The Littlest Groom" and "Joe Millionaire".

      Money is evil rent is due but we can't pay it cuz we're broke cuz we've been working less because corporations are vicious and cut hours instead of useless things like Manager Meetings in Las Vegas and we can't get Jason's taxes done because we can't afford the fees and Rapid Refund costs an arm and a leg and I'm graduating soon with no prospective jobs so I'm stuck at the bookstore for the foreseeable future and I am barely paying my other bills but I keep getting overdrawn and all of Jason's money goes towards the car payment and car insurance and so we're really stressed and thought our "free" Mardi Gras trip sponsored by Anheiser Busch would rejuvenate us but we were responsible for food and smokes and crap souvenirs nobody really needs but hey at least we got free beer so we spent a week's paycheck on food and booze and whatnot and can't catch up and even if we borrow from the 'rents we don't know when we can pay them back cuz we never get ahead and holy shit what if one of us got sick cuz Jason has no health insurance and mine runs out in May after graduation so I'm waiting for my tax return which I got done because my Dad did it for me but Jason told me today that the state didn't hire any temporary workers so refunds will be taking a very long time and I really don't know what we're going to do so now I'm considering selling my cd's and books and such but I probably won't get very much for them god i wish we could pay for everything and not have to get bailed out by moms and dads and if only we could put away a little each week but I don't think there's enough for a blowjob from a toothless hooker on 8 Mile between our two accounts and here we thought we were so adult for living on our own but we can't even take care of ourselves and we would have a lot of money if we quit smoking but with all this stress who can quit smoking so we're in a bit of a catch-22 and I'm not really sure what we're gonna do cuz you can't really live on love alone but I'm willing to try cuz Jason's my soul mate so I know in the end we're really gonna be all right.

      Jason and I went to see Starsky and Hutch on Friday and I've needed a few days to process the experience.  See, I'm a huge Starsky and Hutch fan and from the moment I found out about the movie, I've waivered between elation and anxiety.  I knew that by setting the movie in the seventies, it would be kitschy.  And boy, was it!  Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson do a good job of playing themselves while wearing S&H costumes.  A few moments in the film reflected the TV show, but for the most part, it seems Todd Phillips took just the idea of S&H and did whatever he wanted.  I mean, Stiller's Starsky worked out!  Starsky hated exercise on the show--Hutch was the health nut.  And Hutch in the movie is a crooked cop! WTF?  Things like that sort of bummed me out.  If you want to see a funny movie but you don't care that it is unfaithful to the source material, sure, it's ok.  Maybe I'm too critical. Luckily, the first season of the show is now available on DVD.  I could not be more excited about that!

      This is my first blog.  I tried to post on my boyfriend's blog, but I guess it just didn't feel right.  So what do you need to know?  I'm a senior at Oakland University in Michigan, majoring in English Lit. I work at a bookstore, and hope to have a career in publishing.  I'm a complete bibliophile, and have a tendency to become obsessive about the written word. In classic Teen Beat fashion, I will provide some insight into my favorite things right now (subject to change any minute):  I currently love the new Norah Jones album, but my musical tastes lean more towards rock (PJ, Social D, the Clash, the White Stripes, the Strokes, etc.); I'm currently reading Indian Killer by Sherman Alexie for my Major American Writers class, and it's fantastic; I collect comic books, and adore Fables by Bill Willingham; and I am somewhat hesitant to see the Starsky and Hutch movie because I love love love the TV show (even if the show went off the air a year before I was born).  I look forward to reading any comments people have.  Hopefully, this blog will make you laugh or think or cry or want to dance in your underwear.  I have a tendency to rant a lot and swear like a trucker.  Ooh, this is gonna be fun.

      So...finals are done.  I graduate May 1.  And yet...school's not over.  I have to take another class this Spring because the genius Academic Advisors at my university failed to figure out I was short one class.  So, starting May 3, I'll be in British Medieval Lit.  Woo.  So graduating it pretty anti-climatic.  But only one class should be a piece of cake, right?  And I've finally been able to start reading books I, not my professors, want me to read.  I've read two mysteries so far this week.  I'm a very happy little bookworm.  Maybe I should keep track of what I'm reading and give short reviews.  Something to consider.    So far:   The Ghost and Mrs. McClure   by Alice Kimberly and   'Til Death Do Us Part   by Kate White.  Next up:  I'm leaning towards   Speechless   by Yvonne Collins and Sandy Rideout.  I'm also spending time this week working on my resume.  Mama needs a new pair of shoes.

      I'm graduating May 1.  While I have been shown immense support from Jason and my sister, I'm a bit saddened by the fact it doesn't seem my parents give one iota of a shit.  They've never taken much interest whether I even went to college.  Is it some sort of blue-collar mentality, like "I don'e need no stinkin' edjumacation"?  I'd like to think I accomplished something, working while going to school full time.  My Mom called a little while ago to tell me she won't be able to take everyone out to lunch like she said she would because her husband still hasn't found a job.  See, when I graduated high school, my Mom moved to Vegas with the man she eventually married.  Now they're back, 5 or 6 years later, and she's throwing my life into an upheaval again.  I was doing fine before she came back.  Now I constantly get guilt trips about not seeing her enough, even though she knows I have to work weekends because I go to school.  My parents had decided that if us kids wanted to go to college, they couldn't help financially.  So I work.  A lot.  I don't know what it means to have a weekend.  And maybe if she and my father would have had any foresight, they would have considered that maybe their children would want a higher education.  But they didn't, and they also wouldn't sign any loans, so I owe the government over $15,000 in student loans in my name.  So you see, I think my Mom has absolutely NO right to give me shit about ANYTHING.  Prior to my Mom's offer to take everyone to lunch, Jason's Mom had offered to throw me a party since she owns a home and both of my parents rent (Dad in a townhouse, Mom and Greg in an apartment).  My Mom had a shit-fit about someone else throwing me a party, so I kibashed it.  Now, I'm not even getting lunch.  She offered for everyone going to commencement to come back to her prison cell of an apartment to eat cold cuts and shit.  I know she's trying to do what she can and I'm trying not to be bratty about it, but I'm tempted to invite only Jason and my sister (and her boyfriend if he comes up with her) and Rudy and Susan if they can go to commencement, then the six of us will go get drunk.  Jason told me this is my day, not hers, so I can do whatever the fuck I want.

      Jen's taking me to New York for graduation!!!!!  It's a definite high-point in my not-so-hot life right now.  I wish Jason was going, too, but he's happy that my first time there is with my big sister.  I have the most wonderful boyfriend in the whole world.    So Jen wants me to make a list of things I want to see.  CBGB's, def.  I wanted to see if we can get tickets to see a taping of The Daily Show, too.  We're going at the end of June, and I'm peeing myself with anticipation.

      It's Memorial Day, and I have the day off work.  I planned on sleeping in really late and bumming around and not rushing to go anywhere.  It doesn't look like I'll get to be so carefree.  Both Jason's Mom and my Mom want us to stop by, and Ben wants us to come over tonight.  I'm not feeling very social, but I might have fun.  I'm feeling like I have no self-confidence.  I looked online and Borders isn't currently looking to fill any position I a)am interested in and b)am qualified for.  But both Jason and Dori, two people that I highly respect the opinions of, seem to believe I am more than capable of succeeding.  I guess I'm in a sort of post-college funk.  And I keep thinking Oakland is going to send me a letter telling me I'm not actually done.

      Since I graduated, I've been thinking a lot about my future.  I'm having trouble visualizing myself in a good place.  I have let myself become complacent and I need to learn that while the bookstore has been good to me (for the most part), I owe them nothing.  I need to move on, because I'm way too comfortable doing something I no longer have any passion for doing.  I'm actually sad and near tears when I wake up each morning and realize I have to go there.  I wish there was a way I could take a few weeks off and look for something else and have some time for ME.  This woman at the bank asked me how I'm doing (she knew I graduated) and I told her fine.  She said she knew something wasn't right and said I should take a month off.  I told her that's a luxury I can't afford and she said sometimes you can't afford NOT to do it.  She's right.  I'm going to jump from a shitty job to a harder job and while an increase of money will be nice, when will I have time to figure out who I am?  It's not fair to Jason, either, because he's the only thing in my life I'm really happy about but that isn't enough and he and I both know that.  If you aren't happy or satisfied in your own life, how can you function in a relationship?  I don't want us to resent eachother.    Here's my dream: Jason and I are able to buy another car so he can finish school and I can work at the Borders home office in Ann Arbor.  He finishes school in a year and we sell the cars then move to New York, where we can always use public transportation.  I get a job at HarperCollins or Simon and Schuster or some other huge publishing house, working as an editor.  Jason gets a job as speechwriter for Hillary Clinton, who has decided to run for president in 2008.  We have a fantastic apartment in an up-and-coming hip neighborhood where it's safe and rent is relatively reasonable.  My sister and her boyfriend find jobs in NY, too, and finally get to move there so Jason and I always have somebody to hang out with.  We eventually get married and adopt a couple pets (but never have children) and live in NYC until we're old and rich and then we move to a nice rural place where we spend our twilight years writing novels.    It could totally happen.

      I have made the decision that I need to "man up," because I'm not nearly as spunky as I used to be.  I have let life knock me down and it's high time I get the fuck up.  Thank you, Jason, for showing me the light.

      Tues, June 8: Rudy and Susan marry.  Awesomely sweet. Thurs, June 10: Get a call from Home Office, wanting to set up a phone interview for Assistant Buyer job.  Super Awesome. Sat, June 12: Rudy's B-day, we go downtown to celebrate.  Awesome fun. Sun, June 13: Wedding reception at Metro Beach.  Awesome time had by all until it started storming at 7p.m.  Should have probably taken as a sign of things to come. Mon, June 14: Totally shitty interview, in which I'm told I have no data analysis skills and need to look for a lower, entry-level position.  This after being convinced I was a shoo-in.  Dammit!  Breakdown ensues, in which I decide I'm qualified for nothing, I'm fat, I'm ugly, I'm dumb,I'm a failure, and so on.  Jason, best boyfriend ever, reassures me it's their loss, not mine.  Thank the gods he was home when it happened.  Then it hit me that I'd have to explain what happened to my loved ones, and I was really embarassed that I had been so confident and then was totally shut down. The next couple days, I was pretty down.  But then The Pistons won the Finals and I felt very happy again.  So today was the last day of my last class. WOO HOO!  Time to focus on getting myself a jobby-job that will pay the bills AND give me satisfaction.  Tall order, maybe, but why should I settle?

      The Pistons could have done it tonight.  They could have headed home with two under their belt.  But no.  Late in the 4th quarter, they allow Kobe to get the ball and shoot a 3 pointer.  WTF?  I am so sick of the "Dynasty".  I understand the Lakers are a good team, but it seemed like the first half, everything was called in their favor, no matter what.  The Pistons have an amazing opportunity, and I know they can do it.    They're being interviewed on TV right now, and Jason made a good point.  He said he doesn't like the fact that they're going home downtrodden.  They don't seem like they're pissed or hungry for a win.  They seem depressed.  I hope they can change their attitude in the next 48 hours.  Even if I move to another city, I'll always root for the Pistons.  It's in my blood.  And Jack Nicholson doesn't play for The Lakers.  Can we keep the camera off him for a few minutes?

      Rudy and Susan got married today, and Jason and I had the honor of being the witnesses.  Sitting in the courtroom was a little surreal, a wedding among the civil infractions and guys with mullets in handcuffs.  The judge was really cool and looked a like a cross between Pistons coach Larry Brown and Dr. Drew Pinsky.  We then went to Mongolian Barbeque in Royal Oak for lunch.  Rudy and Susan both seemed a little shell-shocked, and I kinda felt like a voyeur during a very private time.  I'm very happy for them; they're wonderful people and have changed eachother for the better since they've been together.  I am blessed to have them as my friends, and I know they are going to have a fantastic life together.  Susan asked for some words of wisdom as we drove to the courthouse, but a)I'm younger than her, and b)I've never been married, so I stumbled over my words.  So let me try this again.  Here goes:  Susan, you have made my good friend Rudy a better man.  You have softened the edges and shown him it's alright to laugh.  The love he has for you transcends this world, and I've never seen him so happy and at peace.  As long as the two of you can continue to inspire eachother, challenge eachother, support eachother, and remember that your relationship is more important than any petty day to day crap, you can expect a lifetime of joy.  I love you both, and I wish you all the best.  Don't worry, Jason, you're not gonna get an ultimatum any time soon.  Love you, honey!

      Ok, so I applied for a position at Home Office today.  Assisstant Buyer for the Children's department.  Yeak, ok, so I don't really like kids (There are many exceptions, like my nephews and Jason and Sarah K's little lady, Jordan) but I really like kid's books.  Fingers crossed.  Jason and I are going to see Harry Potter tonight.  I think it looks great.  We learned our lesson about seeing kid's movies in the afternoon (too many damn kids!--go figure), so we're going to a really late show.  I really should be reading the books...  New York trip has been moved to July, which is ok, cuz that gives me time to actually save some money!  And I simply must make a list of places I want to visit.  Rudy and Susan are getting married in just a couple of days.  Why am I the one that's nervous?  Maybe cuz seeing friends get married makes me realize we're all growing up.  Eek!  The Pistons are going to the Finals!  Not that I'm a huge sports nut, but I have invested a lot of time watching the last few series with Jason.  It reminds me of when I was little and watched the late eighties, early nineties Pistons with my Dad.  Jason and I realized recently that we both had the same Pistons Back to Back Champs T-shirts with the caricatures of the whole team.  Weird!  Things are good right now.

      Our internet got shut off so I haven't been able to check my email, catch up on celeb gossip, or blog, in over a week.&nbsp; I went to New York July 17-20 and I have to say that it has rewired my brain.&nbsp; I hear dpeople saying in the airport on the way home, "It was neat to visit, but it's SO FAST!&nbsp; I could never live there!"&nbsp; I was thinking, "This is the most spectacular place I've ever been.&nbsp; How could I not live here?"&nbsp; It was amazing.&nbsp; I know right now I couldn't possibly afford to live there, definitely not in the city, but I feel like everything I do in MI is simply biding time 'til we move there.&nbsp; Everywhere I went, I thought, Jason would love this.&nbsp; When I get more time, I'll detail my exploits further.&nbsp; Didn't see many celebs, but I did catch a glimpse of a few,&nbsp;the biggest being Michael Keaton.  I don't even care if Home Office doesn't offer me the Vendor Liaison job.&nbsp; I don't even want it.&nbsp; I want to do things that make me happy, because life is too short to simply do things you think you're "supposed" to.

      Watching "I Love the '90's" on VH1.  It's...boring.  The graphics and background music selections aren't '90's, they just suck.  Has not enough time passed for the decade to properly marinate in the minds of our finest B-list comedians, or was the decade really that uneventful?  Perhaps it is because the 90's were a time when Jason and I were just coming of age, and our jaded, easily unimpressed demeanors are simply blocking us from appreciating the Art of both Gerardo and "Family Matters".  I will continue to watch the series.  Maybe 1992-1999 will be more entertaining.  Like the pursuit of a better-paying job, I will approach the show with cautious optimism.

      I have another phone interview with Borders Home Office tomorrow, this time for a Vendor Liaison.  I'm not quite sure what the position entails.  Hmmm.  I wonder if I should find out before the phone call?  I checked out  Job Interviews for Dummies . I need to be prepared this time.  I refuse to get my hopes up until she says, "Well, why don't we set up a face-to-face interview?"  Until then, I am cautiously optimistic.

      I go to JC Penney's yeaterday because I had a gift certificate.  I find some clothes and go to the dressing room.  I and another woman wait for open rooms.  A woman walks out of the room.  I go into the empty one.  She comes back, throws her weight against the door, and starts yelling, "My things are in there!  You know my things are in there.  Get out of there now!"  Meanwhile, I am PANTLESS.  And there's no purse or anything in the room.  Only a shirt and a suit hanging up.  How was I to know she didn't just leave them in there cuz she didn't want them?  I start yelling, "Please quit barging in, I don't have any pants on.  You left the room."  She says, "You didn't ask if I was finished."  I said, "You left the room.  You saw people waiting for a room.  Get out of here NOW!"  She tries to shove herself all the way in.  I push her out the door and throw my weight against the door.  I put on my pants, and exit the room.  The woman that was standing behind me starts yelling at the psychopath, "YOU BITCH!"  Which made me happy, feeling a sense of solidarity.  The sales associate comes running in, asking what happened.  I tell her, and the woman in line with me tells her she saw everything, and that the crazy lady was a total bitch and that she saw everything.  The salesgirl says she will call security if the woman even looks at me wrong again.  I was very very shaken (For Christ's sake, I WAS PANTLESS).  I bought the clothes in my arms and just hoped they fit.  They did, thankfully.  I'm never going clothes shopping alone again.  Generally, Women + 4th of July sale = psychosis.  Thank the Goddess I found some really cool clothes.

      Go into your local comic book store today and get yourself a free comic book!  It's an annual event and it's a fantastic idea.  Most of the free books are geared towards kids, but you might find something really cool.  Then go see Spiderman 2, tied (to me and Jason) for the best comic book movie ever made (along with X2).  It's great--the story is better, the effects look better, Kirsten is less annoying (although she again is unnecessarily and gratuitously soaking wet in one scene), and the villain is even more badass.  It gave me chills and I had to practice a lot of self-restraint to not cheer at some points.  We also saw Fahrenheit 9/11 recently.  Also amazing.  But I need more time to put my thoughts together to give a coherent review.

      My Mom's husband Greg had to have emergency bypass surgery today.  QUINTUPLE BYPASS (is that the right word?  It's 5 bypasses).  My Mom called me around 2:30 to tell me he had an appointment with a cardiologist today because of recurring chest pains, and the doctor sent him directly to the hospital.  Around 7, the surgery was finished, and Mom was going to be able to see him soon.  I was with her for about 4 1/2 hours, and she looked so strong.  She's an incredibly strong woman.  I used to think sometimes that maybe she was selfish or cold, but I realize she believes she must stay strong not only for herself, but for those around her.  I think he'll be ok.  Lots of recuperation (and no more smokes or beer or lunchmeat or big sausage and egg breakfasts--he's gonna be soooo pissed).  I was really upset when she called and told me about it, which is strange, because Greg and I were never the best of friends.  But he makes my Mom happy, so I can deal, and he really is nicer to me than he used to be.  Of course, I'm not a snotty teenager anymore, so that probably helps.
