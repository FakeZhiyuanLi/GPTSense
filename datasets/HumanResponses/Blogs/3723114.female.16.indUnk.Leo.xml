      I'm dying inside Somebody help me out cuz I'm losing my mind. Where do I go, where do I turn Get me out of this whole before I fucking burn!  Don't be a fake and live a lie Be yourself, it's as good as being hi You wouldn't like to be me So live your own life and just let me be  I'm lost in time and I can't find my way If I ever get back what would you have to say? Do you still love me, are you still mine? If not, I'd rather stay here untill the end of time.  In this world, there's too many lies. In my eyes, too many tears to cry. I look in the miror and ask myself "why?" Is this the end, is it time to say good-bye?

      I'm only gonna get what I've got But yet I want so much more I'm only gonna be what I am  But yet my hart is so sore I'm so confused, I don't know what to do My head said no, but all I think about is you And I don't want to like you any less So let's just pray and hope for the best If I follow my thoughts, where will I be? If I follow my heart, where will it lead? They say there's no turning back, But how do I know if I'm on the right track? Maybe there isn't a right way I don't have to do what people say I'll follow my heart, it's what I want I'll open it up and won't let it shut.

      Not enough time for sleeping Too much time for thinking But how much time for living, In this world which we are breathing?  The seconds on the clock are laughing As I daydream of absolutely nothing. Most of my life is just a dream Is life even real? Or does it just seem?

      Why is life the way it is? I want to hide and never come out. Can't someone just tell me this? Why am I here? What is this all about?  I think in one way and then I don't Is what I am seeing only my dreams? Maybe life is one big joke. Is there an answer for what it all seems?  So much to do in this life, So many questions, so little time. Am I ever gonna be a wife? Am I supposed to learn in this amount of time?  If you tell me the answers,  I won't forget. If I do, remind me!  Otherwise I'm in deep shit!  God send me an angel to keep me out of trouble. You can take your time, but please make it on the double.  What am I to do until the day I die? I can't just sit around and ask myself "why?". What am I to do if I take the wrong path? Look back, say "oops", and then just laugh?
