      It looks like Sadr may be trying to squeeze out of the situation. Of course, he's done this before and I have my doubts as to his true intentions.  In my opinion, the Iraqis should settle the matter once and for all with this little would-be tyrant.  -------------- NAJAF, Iraq — Radical cleric Muqtada al-Sadr ( urlLink search ) accepted a peace plan Wednesday calling for his militiamen to disarm and leave their hideout in a revered Shiite shrine, raising hopes of ending a battle that has threatened to undermine Iraq's fledgling interim government. But gunfire and explosions crackled across Najaf ( urlLink search ) after the deal was announced and there was no indication of whether there could be a quick end to two weeks of fighting between al-Sadr's forces and U.S. soldiers and government troops in this holy city.  urlLink http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,129379,00.html

      It look like there will be  a bloodbath at the main shrine in Najaf when the Iraqis move in to remove Sadr and his hoodlums. ------------ Iraqi Forces May Raid Najaf's Holy Shrine Today, AP Reports Aug. 18 (Bloomberg) -- Iraqi troops may raid the holy Imam Ali Shrine in Najaf today in an attempt to force militants loyal to Shiite Muslim Cleric Moqtada al-Sadr out of the area, the Associated Press reported, citing Iraqi Defense Minister Hazem Shaalan. Al-Sadr and his militia, known as the Mahdi Army, have been fighting with U.S. coalition and Iraqi forces in the holy city of Najaf for over a week. Al-Sadr is holed up in the Imam Ali Mosque, the holiest Shiite site in Iraq. A delegation for the Iraqi National Conference yesterday visited Najaf to try and negotiate an end to the uprising with al- Sadr, AP reported. The delegates were unable to meet with him, though did meet his aides, AP said. While U.S. troops are operating with Iraqi forces in Najaf, only Iraq's security forces will be allowed to enter the Imam Ali Mosque, interior ministry spokesman Sabah Kadhim last week said in a telephone interview from Baghdad.

      When I was a kid reading comics, I always loved to read the ads in the back with the X-Ray vision glasses, little mermen fishes that you could raise in a bowl and other stuff. Here's one I ran across on-line:  urlLink http://www.prankplace.com/index.htm   It's full of lots of interesting gag gifts and just plain old silly stuff.  -- Chip

      Watching Mr. Kerry's antics over the past year, has caused a visceral dislike for the man to grow over time. However, I almost feel a twinge of pity when I see his ambitious plans crumbling around him. In my daily dose of opinion from the townhall.com, this little nugget landed in my inbox.  ------------------- It seems the Swift Boat Vets have delivered a swift kick to Kerry’s crotch. Ouch! That’s gotta hurt. What’s ironic -- and typical -- is the Left’s hysterically hypocritical spin machine screaming for the Swifties’ 411 to be immediately Dixie Chicked. The self- righteous, first amendment waving, Michael Moron embracers are not so free with freedom of speech when it happens to slow roast their presidential nominee a mere 80 or so days before the nation schleps to the polls. What’s funny, [not funny, "ha-ha" … funny "weird"] is as long as the information comes from one uberliberal, overweight, college dropout with a communist bent, who routinely attempts to make "W" look like a greedy gnome who wrongfully plays golf while he unrepentantly sends our kids to the Gulf, well … that’s cool. Spreading such misinformation, created from the ether by one of the left’s darlings should not, according to most liberals, be examined. No! It should be believed and be considered inerrant and infallible, and the purveyor of such rank propaganda lifted high as a prophet. But flip to today. More than 60 decorated, non-politically active, eyewitnesses of Kerry’s four month stint in Vietnam -- men who ate, slept, and served a few feet from the Dems’ presidential applicant – have written a heavily documented, devastating tell all, Unfit for Command, credibly contradicting Kerry’s account of his fleeting 120 days in ‘Nam. They represent more than 250 Swift Boat veterans, including Kerry’s commanding officer! So, what’s the response from all the usual political and media suspects? What the heck do they know? Why should they be trusted? Dismiss ‘em; censure ‘em … and if they keep trying to talk, just shout them down. So, allay our concerns, Mr. Kerry. Weigh in and show us the Swift Boat Veterans are wrong. Prove to us that your Tour of Duty was not a ton of dooky.   urlLink http://www.townhall.com/columnists/douggiles/dg20040814.shtml    -- --- Chip

      Hello everyone. This is my first post on my spanking new blog. Since I am not as erudite or suave as some of my favorite bloggers, I will start out simply by posting daily events and thoughts in my life.  Here is my picture, it's almost four years old so I will post a more current one when I get around to it.    I spend a lot of time perusing the internet for news and information and can never seem to get enough.  I doubt that my simple site will satiate anyone's thirst for information but here it is.   -- Chip
