       i spent today with my family, like most of the sundays its completely based on that i have school the next day... which obviously sucks and ruins my mood for a decent portion of the day but whatever... sundays are sundays...     &nbsp;   willie came over as soon as i woke up and we just chilled and watched TV... played some video games...     &nbsp;   but the highlight of my day isnt that i got to hang out with my older brother, is that an ex-business partner came by today to drop off a delivery...&nbsp; call me ... it has to do with my street pharmacy job... hehe whatever.. call me if u need... i have a limited supply but this time ill refill consistantly... i hope so at least.. &nbsp; &nbsp;  interesting fact of the day  &nbsp;&nbsp;  the average life-span of a major league&nbsp;&nbsp;baseball is 7 pitches....  &nbsp;
