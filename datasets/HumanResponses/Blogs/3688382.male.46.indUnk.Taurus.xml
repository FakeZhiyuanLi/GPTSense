      June is winter here in New Zealand and that means limited fishing opportunities with access only to certain rivers and lakes.  While the opportunities to fish are still there, catching fish is another story at this time of year.  Spawning time has been and gone and with that and the cooler water temperatures, trout are scarce and hard to catch. Conditioning is not the best either on the trout at this time of year as we await the arrival of the new season.  The "official" trout fishing season for most rivers in New Zealand runs from 1st October each year until April 30th.  Many of the lakes are open all year to the keen anglers although some restrictions apply to methods and baits that can be used.  Variations to season dates occurs on many waters subject to the region, habitat and fish stock factors, and is administered by Fish and Game New Zealand.  This organisation has it's own regional bodies who are responsible for the control and development of the trout fishery and hunting resources and work in conjunction with other organisations such as Department of Conservation, Ministry of Fisheries and Agriculture and regional environmental bodies (in our case, Environment Southland).  While Fish and Game receives some "public" funding much of its revenue comes from those that pursue the sport and pastime of troutfishing and hunting by way of license fees.  A full season trout fishing license in Southland last year cost $86(NZ) and allows a fisherman access to all New Zealand waters with the exception of Lake Taupo in the North Island. This body of water requires a special license.  Access to rivers and lakes in New Zealand is governed by a long held "statute" known as The Queen's Chain which means we can freely access and fish along any rivers and streams where this applies.   Not all rivers are covered by this "statute" and where this is the case, permission from the landowner is required to gain access to the waterways.  In such cases, and with consideration to the landowners who in many instances are farmers, Fish and Game negotiate access points to the rivers to allow local fishermen to reach various parts of the river systems.  Seasonal restrictions can apply where farmers will close access such as at lambing time which runs through August to September, so that stock are not disturbed or pastures damaged.  In the main though, New Zealand and Southland in particular, is a fisherman's paradise in every respect.  Trout is not the sole game fish either, with salmon featuring in many of the rivers and lakes, along with rainbow trout.  In the summer we can also venture to the Port of Bluff, twenty minutes drive from home, and fish from the wharf for sea run salmon. This is without the need for a license as no license is required in New Zealand to fish in the sea. A real bonus!!!  Sea fishing will also feature as part of the Kiwi Fishing Adventures blog as here again, we have another part of paradise on our doorstep.  From Bluff we travel by boat to New Zealand's newest National Park, Stewart Island, a tranquil and beautiful island forty to fifty minutes off the coast.  This is my first update, and in the future I will bring you some pics of some of the adventures we have and I look forward to hearing of your fishing adventures as well.  Good fishing!!
