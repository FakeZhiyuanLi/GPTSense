      This is the last week of Term 2 and the last of the semester. I never thought I'd be looking forward to school holidays again! But here we are.  On Thursday there is the end of term celebration do, at the school. I'm really looking forward to it. I wonder if there will be any good lookers at the partay... hmm another reason to look forward to going!  Things are going swell with my school work, everything is just cruising. Except my German, but thats okay. German is in a whole other language!!!

      Oh! I almost forgot to add this. I have received TWO HA's (High Achievements) which are basically A's. One for Health, another for English. I never have gotten A's before at face to face high school, so this is definately something thats working out for me.

      I have been invited to the Open Access College End Of Term Celebration! I'm still deciding whether or not to attend, It will be difficult having to meet these tractor boys and quiet mousey girls. Maybe they might be really hot! But anyways, They are providing Lunch & they have organized some sporting activities, I think I might join in some of them, plus it would be cool to meet the teachers and stuff. Speaking of teachers, turns out I'm only going to be having one more lesson with Rachel Moore! She has been relieving another teacher who has been on leave, and she will return next term, meaning Rachel will hide out. Which is sad - She's my favourite!

      I went back down to year nine German on Wednesday, and for fucks sake, we are doing Grammar in year 9 as well as year 10. THERE IS NO ESCAPE. I have my German classes now on Wednesdays at (Grr, I used to have Wednesdays off) NINE GOD DAMN A.M, and also Mondays at 2:30pm. SOO, now, my only day off completely everything, is Friday. I don't get the equivalent of a weekend. But that's okay - I chose to lead this lifestyle, so I will live it. Hell, at least I dont have to get up at 7am every morning and go to the government instituted hell they call 'School'.   Andrew also sent me a msg, asking how everything was going. I told him it was treating me well, because it has. Nobody has gone off at me for work that I have forgotten to send in, and I was expecting the teacher to yell at me when I said that I was having trouble motivating myself to do the maths work. But instead she just went through it with me, and told me that I should just do one question per day. I can  so  handle that I reckon.  I guess it has been a while since I have updated this, but not much has been happening on the Open Access front. I am thinking of asking Debbie (Health Teacher) if I can get paperwork or something so I can do work experience. I would absolutely love to do it at The Advertiser in the city, but it would also be great to do it at a big hotel, like the Stamford, or Hilton or something like that. I would also be ecstatic if I could do it at QANTAS or Virgin Blue. I could start off one day at the check in counter, and then the next day I could help load luggage, maybe the day after that I could assist in customer service, and then if I plead and plead, maybe I could even go on a return flight, maybe to Melbourne & Back or something.  That would be so cool.   We also had a  relief  teacher the other day. Would you believe!?! A Relief Teacher over the phone! I was rather shocked.

      This is stressing me.  It will take time to get back into the swing of this I know, and it IS hard to motivate myself as there is no teacher to yell at me ("Get back to work!") I'm scared that I'll fail this and everyone will be disappointed and ashamed.

      I have a lesson at 9am, and I am soo gonna be sleepy. Its my 9am lesson with Wendy Roberts, studying German. I havent done much work and all and she's going to be all 'Do it nooww pleease and send it in ASAP!' but I can do it. I just need to know what Arbeitsblatt 19 is. Arbeitsblatt 19 is a reference in my book, it says something along the lines of: Complete the questions on Arbeitsblatt 19. I have an Arbeitsblatt workbook, but I dunno how to find 19.. There are no chapters, and the pages start at number 22. I guess Frau Roberts will let me know.

      Welcome to my humble abode.  I have recently begun learning year 10 via Distance Education, at the  urlLink Open Access College  in South Australia. I decided I'd blog about my experiences and then have something to reflect back on when the time comes that I won't be doing distance education, or perhaps just when I feel like looking back on it.  I have another Blog, which is just about what happens in my life and stuff. This is what I posted on my other blog, on the 24/5/04:     Hey, I re-joined the ranks of society and became an active member of the community. As of today, I am now a full-time student at the Open Access College. Pretty sweet, huh?  All those cold nights laying in the foetal position thinking, and crying, "I'll never be able to go to schoolies...." and "I can forget my formal.." are now just a distant memory. I can look forward to those once again now!! :)   So yes, as of today, I am now a full-time student, part-time waiter. And I cant be happier. Actually, I can, but I don't want to go into that -- Bleh.   Mondays I have English with Rachel Moore at 12midday. Tuesdays I have German with Wendy Roberts (Which is strange.. get this: My boss's name is Lara Wendy Roberts.) and the teacher's husband Looooves the BBC. Freaky eh?!  Wednesdays I don't have anything of yet. Thursdays I have another German Lesson. Friday is blank too. But its okay, My Maths & I.T teachers havent contacted me yet to see when I can do classes with them.     Since then, my I.T & Maths teacher has contacted me. Her name is Pat Sinclair, and I have Maths on Thursdays at midday, and I.T on Tuesdays at 10am. Already the workload is quite good, its not enough to make me say stuff like "FUCK THIS!" but its just enough to be challenging. I already know that I'm going to struggle in German, but its okay, because its in a whole other language!... Okay, enough with the bad puns, eh? But moving right along, I'm so far enjoying it. I'm two weeks in, and everything is looking upwards. Wish me luck.

      Yeah, I'm on school holidays. It feels good - I remember what its like to not have to bother about work or any deadlines... just living in the absolute moment.   I went to the end of term shin-dig at the school, met Emma & Nikita. I have real school friends now! Too bad they arent in any of my classes -- but maybe in the future we might cross paths academically. We were playing Basketball, and I ran into some tiny blonde girl and fell over and landed on my wrist and injured it. I was so sure I broke it for about 10 minutes coz I could only move a few fingers. Then after half an hour I could move them all. 4 days later the pain went away, So I didnt really do anything Major I reckon.  Listening to music loudly, cant think of words to blog on here. Thanks!

      I wanted to write and say how much better life is without German in my school curriculum.   So I will.   Life is so much better without German in my school curriculum!
