      I thought about the project and I wonder if it was the right thing to do...Well Anyhow today, love is in the air. LordRaven bunking in again. He made three thousand dollars yesterday. So as I was saying, love is a mystery. It is totally incomprehensible. It is defined in so many ways. I just thought I would like to share with the masses what I think about love.  I think love is like ice-cream. Sweet... like cotton candy. Cotton Candy... The perfect girl must like cotton candy and ice-cream.

      Bet you missed my sexy Ass. Well ladies, due to Hardi's weak attempt on his new 'project' he left quite a big hole for me to come back in. Man, I missed this crib. So ladies, I have decided that RavenJr is ready to play. Hardi will be out for the next couple of days. Shouldn't have stayed up so late all the time lil boy. Well stupid Hardi, I am back and you have to deal with that.  Anyway, all the clients I called today were freaking happy to hear my voice. They thought I had retired from the business. yeah...right. If you require my services (ladies only) just e-mail me. Its $25 per hour and $4,000 for a whole month. And $100,000 for full services.  -LordRaven

      Woah...  Three weeks of the holidays are gone. My second attempt to try and make a damn Blog. Its not really anything flashy. Just wanted to post what I thought about during my day. Anyhow, my alter-ego, LordRaven has somehow crept back in last night. Told me that he was back and that he needed a night to stay. His bunking just below my Cerebrum.   So now what should I do? I am seriously so damn tired. Four days of non-stop gym training and I'm still bummed. But my chest and biceps are really defining. I got loads of revision and I can't fucking keep awake. Just watched the OC and have to comment that Summer and Julie Cooper are bloody hot. One has nice boobs and the latter is a MILF! Pure-blood MILF!   Need to go back to school on Monday to collect some damn books. And I ate ice-cream, wow. It was amazing how much ice-cream I ate. Well mom is gonna order pizza tonight. Well the Project Thrist is going to a tough state. Candidate One is surely no go. Candidate two also no go. Candidate Three, little light and Candidate Four...darn... Must do something to get the results I want. Lord Raven returned and once he found out about the Project he was laughing himself silly. He banged on my Corpus Callosum, causing a really bad migraine.   -Hardi

      (Realised that a lot of people read my blog.)  I realised I have a fan club. Haha. sec 2s who suckup to me call me Sexmachine. Haha. Ok. Told them don't be like the other mofos in school. This sec 2s are mostly soccer players and rugby guys. They at least show us respect and see how nice we bond? Stupid ass AhBeng mutherfarkers are something they are not. And they all will be the only ray of hope for our school.   Anyway. I noticed I am not satisfied... I am currently contemplating two things in life. The O Levels is my top priority and winning Idah is second. Short-Term goals. In the near future, bagpack to China and through India, into Pakistan, buy AK-47, wear turban, grow beard, join Osama. Haha. Then go get RPG and shoot some damn plane down. Long-term goal, live till 50.   Seriously I am just really confused. Mid-Teen crisis.  Yeah.  [Oh...Birthday coming really close]  &nbsp;

      Really huh?   (Latest news. Chris did not like the DA Awards, so I am here to apologize for using his name. Relax bud. Don't take it personally k?)   Well there was school today... Yep, SCHOOL. I mean...like WTF mate? Some of you will go... LIKE DUH?! But I tell you today, school was fantastic... Acted like some Mafia Don during POA class. Was really funny how I asked a sec 2 boy to kiss my balls. Lol. An avid GODFATHER fan, I wanted to recreate the scene of&nbsp;Don Corleone asking the guy to kiss his ring. Gym was awesome to. For the pass two days it has been really power...   Anyhow. Idah messaged me&nbsp;and told me that the other dude who is after her is not gonna send her home today. I mean. The f-tard has already given her a bouquet of flowers, sent her home&nbsp;quite often, but still I hold an upper hand. Lol. I think cause I am SEXIER, HOTTER and way more&nbsp;SLICK then&nbsp;him. Anyhow, I sent her home&nbsp;on Sunday and spent some time talking to her, got to know her better. I see her every freaking SUNDAY! HA! Well frankly I am damn jealous that this dude is sending her home every single fucking day. But... I guess that is normal... I am just fucking paranoid.&nbsp;   My darling Hou Cheng hurt his eye... lol. I noe its not funny... but he is a cute little guy... Lol. Shaun Neil also... He kena suspected for having denggue fever...   Well too all the guys in 5E1.&nbsp;It has been a nice journey with you guys...   -Kudos to my Genius-

      Welcome to the annual DA Awards. Awards to reward the morons of this world. And today. I would like to congratulate a few idiots who have just entered the official DA list. Nominees range from the walking joke award, the ugly boy award, best dumbass award and the most coveted and fought over title, the HILARIOUS award. We also have a short appreciation presentation on the DEEKY of the Century.   (Drumroll.)   For the Walking Joke Award...   The nominees are as follows...   Rafikee Tan Babboon!  Luke Wee!  The Dick!  Brendan Chua!  Mark Panda Hsiong!   And the winner is.... Rafikee Tan Babboon!   (speech)   "I would like to thank trainers Keith Wong and Kenneth Ho who have nutured me and guided me to become the best walking joke in the world.... Fuck You... heh heh heh... (claps hands over head)   And next award is the UGLY boy award. This award is a very prestigious award. It has been contested for over a very long period of time... They are the epitomy of mutilated faces.   And the nominees are...   Rafikee Tan Babboon!  Luke Wee!  Christopher Gan!   Hmm... The other two nominees have decided to do us a favour and shoot themselves. And the rules of the award states that one must be alive to receive the UGLY boy award.   And the winner is... without a doubt. CHRISTOPHER GAN!   (Speech)   "And I like to thank the Singapore government for deciding to put my face on cigarette packs to scare people for smoking. And eventhough I was forced to wear a bag over my head tonight, tears of gratitude are flowing down my cheeks. SMOKING is bad for your health... Look what happen to me."   The next award is a very special award. It awards the stupidity of some people... this is the DUMBASS award   Nominees are,   Rafikee Tan Babboon  Christopher Gan  Daryl Har  Mark Hsiong  Luke Wee   And a clear winner is Rafikee Tan Babboon.   (Walks up, collects award, points the finger, claps hands over head, bows, leave stage.)   I am feeling a urge of gratitude from the audience to reveal the nominees for the HILARIOUS award. But I am forced to give a short presentation on the DEEKY of the Century. The DEEKY is a title given to a person who has helped make us laugh and cry in joy and tear the sides of our abdomen in happiness. This person has created long-lasting jokes and has influenced part of the DA awards. I would like to present ERNEST SIM for the most DEEKY bugger of this century.   (Film on Ernest)   Ernest Sim...He is the creator of multiple jokes in ACS (Barker) . One of his best jokes make us laugh till today. And that is the Backside Face. Under the strict rules of Jokes, Ernest had created an everlasting print of turning Brendan Chua upside down. He had made it so funny that we actually believe him. Other famous jokes are the Zhen Jie World, Epok-Epok fantasy and the MatRobber. We truly appretiate these fine works from a great man as Ernest and hope he has more of that wit in the future. To our NESTIE.   (Really silly song...)   And finally... The moment of truth... The MOST HILARIOUS PERSON award. This award is a spinoff from Jason Kan's idea of very HILARIOUS people. And this award is to one of the most lamest arse in our class.   The nominees are.   Christopher Gan  Luke Wee  Mark Panda Hsiong  Leonard Ong  Daryl Har   And the winner of the 2004, MHP award is...  LEONARD ONG!  OMG its a fucking upset! Christopher Gan had been touted to win but this was totally unexpected! Leonard Ong has just won the MHP award!   (Speech)   Hello hello... Thank you for... Wait. Let me tell you a joke! What is ten plus ten plus ten plus ten?   (silence)    TEN TEN TEN TEN!      (The last joke is an internal 5E1 joke that Leonard Ong had told us before. You must say it really fast.)  -ThUndErClaP-

      Today I when with an open mind. Yes... An open mind. I looked into the sky and it was promising. It was going to be a good day. Took a deep breath and walked up beyond the school gates. I when around and saw the same farkin sec 2 who I threatened to beat up. Lol. They were funny. They all bowed their heads and walked pass me. Then saw another idiot sec 2.... pants so low. I thought he kena farked int he backside. Pointed at him then laughed. He was all red. Told him to pull up his pants and told him he look like just kena sodomised.     Moronic sec2s idiotic sec 3s and dumbass sec 4s. What the hell is ACS barker gonna turn into once we are gone? I seriously don't know n i dun plan to find out. No one I see will fit the bill we will be passing. Once the great power of 5E1 is exhausted... then what? What will the reputable and awe-inspiring name of ACS (Barker) turn into? A school full of dumbasses? I figure. So I moved on and look at the bright side. At least it was English now...    -Thunderclap-

      And   to those who I have come to love. I must protect you.   That was the task I had to do. Protect my brothers. All 38 of them... even the most annoying one, in the end I do not hate them. Recent events have me thinking. Why has the class suddenly become so disunited? Where has the brotherhood we had experience gone?     Reality grasp over us as we see that we are surrounded by wolves...    And as the brotherhood fell and weaknesses exposed, the wolves attacked. And we stood ground and fended of the wolves. We saw what respect we had held had disintegrated. We had been awaken... We were once kind and lenient but the wolves took advantage of the kindness and attacked us. Ohh.... they learned not to mess with us.     I for one had decided to change my way I handle the fuckers.     So when one small fucker insulted me, I stopped turned and grabbed the clown by the collar and shouted at the fucker, "You fucking better respect us. You fucking better watch your mouth or I will beat you up." The small asshole was shaking and his friends look in shock and awe. They had never seen that happen. I let the monster come out. I had had enough. No fucking person was ever going to get away with even a small comment. We are going to start a new code of conduct. You walk, talk, look at us with disrespect, we will hunt you down. No more leniency. No more... Days grow darker.    [Darkness] - Hardi -

      So I watched Mean Girls. Yeah... I am proud to have to... Lindsay Lohan is super-hot... and I learn a lot about the bitchiness of women. Not only that but it seems they had not refreshed people on the importance of men as they contribute more to the society of teenagedom. In a school like ACS, all guys, we become fierce instinct and we tend to be much colder towards women because we were brought up to dominate and women these days... they don't like us to dominate.  &nbsp;  Nevertheless, the lack of women has its consequences. Some of us tend to be really bitchy. Yes... Bitchy. Today was Brendan Chua. He was really really really really really really Bitchy. No idea why, but I think he cannot tahan us. I understand, we do sort of make fun of him a lot. But dude. Be a MAN! Lol... Just chill brother. You must not take it seriously.  &nbsp;  Anyhow. brings me to another problem in class. The once  UNITED    5E1  now are getting torn. I am your monitor people and I cannot just let you guys hate each other. And trust me. I feel its damn bitchy lor. You guys must stop these attacks on each other. We are the toughest guys in school and that means a lot. Can't let assholes see us so disunited. We must stand strong.  &nbsp;  -Raises the Singapore Flag-  &nbsp;  [National Day is coming] - and so is my birthday...

      After the spat with Jason Kan.&nbsp; We have decided that our talents are better used against a more irritating force... A force they call... Christopher Gan. Yes. I now declare the Jason vs Hardi Blog War over. It never really began anyway. &nbsp; So christopher. Watch out... MUAHAHAHAHA. &nbsp; Ok guys. &nbsp; Christopher Gan is in Jason's Hilarious people list. Yes. Christopher tends to make himself look stupid in front of others. I dunno why, but he just&nbsp;act really really&nbsp;dumb for our entertainment.  &nbsp; Another guy I like to mention will be Brendan Chua. Haha. Brendan is just sooo... whats that word. Retarded... &nbsp; Zhen Jie. This guy lagi best. He has two Ts. Stupid THEORIES and really pointy TITS. &nbsp; I will elaborate further once I got more time...  &nbsp; [Bless you children.] &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

      I walked into Popular to get my ten-year-series and a few pens. So I browsed around, doing pen-shopping, talking to my cousin about cheap good pens when all of a sudden we hear a beautiful voice interrupt out conversation.  &nbsp; "Stablio has good cheap pens..." &nbsp; I turned to be amazed by a sweet looking girl talking behind me. I smiled and thanked her and soon she was helping us find cheap good pens. Wow... Such a helpful girl. But as I got what I needed and turned to thank her again, she was... gone. &nbsp; I would like to dedicate this post to her... &nbsp; Pen Angel. &nbsp; &nbsp;

      She was sick yesterday and didn't message me. Understandable. Told me this morning. Got me a little worried but I'm fine. Anyway. Skool was damn gay. Yes. Damn gay. People were touching each other way too much. And Chris Gan got me pissed off but I managed to keep my cool. The moron insulted my mom and I nearly wanted to smack his fucking face.   But like I said. I understand how to control myself. Well Maths was fucked. yes. Fucked. I feel that Sim was a little edgy and pmssy. But he was nevertheless a brilliant teach in the end. Learn loads of stuff on probability and credit must go to Idah. She thought me the Tree-diagram and stuff. haha. Miss you by the way. Jason and Me have finally started the blog-war. Well he started first but I kicked his arse real fast. And now I'm waiting to see what he has to say. Haha. Damn sianz man. Finish all my damn work and now looking for something to do. My cat is damn friendly to me for some unknown reason...Life is a little boring but the O's are coming real soon and I need to really jumpstart my brain again. Damn lagging.  Well I suggest you check out Jason-vs-Hardi.blogspot.com.  My cat wants food...duh!  -ThUnderClaP-

      What a day.   Monday was strangely a pleasant day. Yes... It was a sexy day, a brilliant day. Only three periods. SS, Physics and MT. Now after that we had some talentime thing in our concert hall. Thinking what the fuck was this about, suddenly we saw this group named Whatever Beavers. So they played the Darkness, I believe in a thing called love. So after that song, they were quite good by the way, they played METALLICA, Master of Puppets. Now sadly this song had been axed by the the teacher and all of a sudden, they were blasting it out and the two teachers were signalling them to stop, they refused continued to play and MR DING! Being the "hero" that he is, walked up and pulled the plug, after they had already stopped playing. You could hear Mrs Aw shouting her head off asking them to stop playing and get off stage... Hilarious...   And after that we did the BHANGRA. With Suraj happily dancing on stage. That was also axed by the way.  Anyhow in the end, I enjoyed myself and everbody left happy.   And Idah, I think your lovely by the way.  -The Love Below-

      Time to dedicate another post to one of my classmates. And today, its Christoper Gan. Yes, one half of the Gan Brothers will come under scrutiny by yours truly. And indeed sometimes Chris, or Chrissy can be really, really...and i mean really moronic. He makes the most dumb of dumb comments and mostly the things he says are...crap. Lol. Well thats the good points...  Chrissy has become a good friend over the last two years and though we have an unusual alliance between Farstaristan and Cow-Kingdom, we never really got into any fights or anything like that. I think I saved Chrissy's arse about 100 times already. Lol.   I feel that Chrissy has more potential then most people think. But if he shuts up more often and listens more, he will be way smarter then me.   And that's the BOTTOMLINE...                Cause LordRaven said so... (Sorry Mr Stone Cold for stealing that)

      Never thought this day would come...but I'm a techno freak now. WTF?! Most would say if you knew me. Yeah my thoughts exactly, but since going to nestie.blogspot.com that all changed...   Doing stupid SS hmwrk now. Need 45 minutes only. Then got Lit. Met a new friend! Haha. And wonder how #4 is taking the question I asked her. Damn. Feeling damn nervous. Mr DiiiNnnGgg didn come today. Then we had a really loser   seriously, he was damn loser. He wore a damn prefect cap everywhere he went... He damn 'kewl' sia. FARKING MORON. And then he tried to tell us off and force us to do our work eventhough it was a free period. Stupid assclown. Of course that caused an uproar and the Knights of the Hexagram were also damn pissed.   Bernard's Bro kena threaten and in the end when the two morons saw that they had just woken the Knights and their friends, they were pissing all over themselves. Stuttering and covering their assess, blaming each other and etc etc.   But the point was that we looked damn bloody cool walking together like that.   Zhen Jie still doesn't like my blog because of the hosted song... What the hell is wrong with him? Britney Spears is farkin awesome. She, to me, is damn chio...nice boobies, but she pissed me off when she got engaged, nevertheless, to another muther-farkin dancer. Saw Matt's blog and couldn't understand his lingo (thanks that someone for the word) And also that reminded me of the homework I'm suppose to do... Mentioned it twice and still I'm typing.   Boob advertisments are ridiculous. To all the women out there, LordRaven loves you the way you are. Paris Hilton is hot hot hot, eventhough some disagree. But I don't like Nicole Ritchie...  -ThUndErCLaP!!!-

      Thats right. The gauntlets are off. Ridhwan Hardi and Jason Kan will go head to head in a gargantuan blog-war. They will trade blows and comment on each other penis sizes. Well as usual you might think one of them has the advantage, but you do not know what the other person might come out with. Both are evenly matched and both are eager to spill some blood.

      And so we had physics class...   The morale of the troops were drained even with the presence of the Knights of the Hexagram. So I had no choice. I had to unite the people. Rallying my knights we spread the message...the task to be done...  And so we greeted Ding...  Yes we all said it out loud and clear... The Knights of the Hexagram had accomplish the immposible. They had tamed the Beast.  Back to life...  School doesn seem so bad. Its quite cheery actually. Heard it is gay to blog. Lol. I am gay! Haha... But that is another story. Had a really cool relief for PE. Thought he was some dumbass loser...but like how I predicted Greece would lose in the Finals, I was wrong... He scored a damn hattrick playing for my team..  -BlEh?-

      Well I decided that since the movie on King Arthur is coming out I might as well promote my Kingdom. That is right. My Kingdom. The great kingdom of Farstaristan. And in this Kingdom it is ruled by the mighty LordRaven and his Knights of the Hexagram.   The Hexagram is a really cool table that can split into two. (internal joke.)  Anyway the Knights of the Hexagram are an holy order who are just really horny. Women fall for us instantly when they see how sexy we are. And we are a sexy bunch of pervs.  Then we had Physics today.

      Jason Kan is a nice guy...seriously. He has to be nice because if he is not nice we will all remind him of the sugery he had in Thailand with me. In a drunken stupor Jason had unwittingly decided to trade my small dick for his huge one.   That small body little boy has no dick now however because he the surgeon forgot to dissinfect the tools after my op. So... Well. The small dick evaporated into thin air and his small balls smell of Zhen Jie's mother curry chicken.

      Im fucking pissed. Thats right. Hardi is fucking pissed. That is good. Pissed is good. Pissed makes me go and train my big big muscles. Jason Kan has a small dick and really small balls. Moron forgot the surgery. He was totally drunk and he took my dick and gave me his.  SO NOW!  I HAVE A BIG DICK AND TWO BIG BALLS! More testosterones.   Anyhow. Me and Brendan should start a WillDing pornsite. It will be promising. And and a second HateDing.com. He's being a damn assclown and it is pissing everyone off. Timothy Wong (Chem Teach) is better then we thought.   Spiderman 2 was cool. Serious shit man. It was damn fucking awesome.   The best song in the world is Majulah Singapura. And second best is the School Anthem. Why? Cause I sing it almost everyday.  TODAY!  My day has been really good. My weight training is improving and my shoulders and biceps going through strength training. Chen Tat was an ass today. Stupid boy was playing with the toy cars in Geography lesson. What a CHILD> but he has a fucking massive bod. Ding is a gay peanut (quote from Brendan). "Where is Shrek?" Wong is nice... Eventhough we were late by 20 minutes. And my alter-ego LordRaven is in my Cerebral Vortex, nursing a hangover.     THE DAY IS BEAUTIFUL.   Hardi

      My fellow brothers,  I write to you tonight as a sign of distress and desperation. Not many will admit this. But the once powerful class of 5E1 is now reduced so severely. Broken brotherhoods and backstabbing among each other. What is becoming of us? Are we lowering ourselves to a worst level? I ask you know. As members and brothers of the mighty class to unite in brotherhood. All 39 of us must set aside our differences and built whatever strength we have lost. As your monitor I see this as the most dire of situations. We must open our eyes and see the bigger picture. Our Teacher, Mr Tang Chee Kuan has done much for us. He has covered our arses in times of need. We now must unite under one banner and do the same for him.  And that brings me to the second topic I wish to discuss. That is academic ability of our class. We have one of the worst records so far. Especially in Math. Something must be done. I know a few have been enlightened and are starting to study. But there is a huge number who still are thinking that its still a far way off. Please my fellow brothers. Wake up. its only 70 days... I repeat 70 days more. We must not let our minds be clouded in bliss and happiness and we must start to panic. It is critical. This is not about getting good results for the school's sake. No! It is for us! Our future. Not the schools.  And the third issue. Teachers. My brothers. The teachers are being as giving as they can. We must not bite at the hand that feeds us. I urge and plead to all that we must show compassion and respect to the ones who are teaching us. From Mr Tang Chee Kuan to Mr Melvin Sim. From Mr Timothy Wong to Mr William Ding. From Mr Alan Lim to Mr Ernest Chia. From Mrs Aw to Miss Nachi Pillai. From Miss Adelaine Tan to Miss Jeanette Wee. They are trying to help us. And therefore for us to receive as much as we can from them we must let give them full respect and not disrupt the class. A small little joke once in a while may be allowed but not every five minutes. I know, as individuals, as brothers, as comrades you understand what I am going on about.  We must do something and it must be done now.  -Monitor Ridhwan Hardi-     -tHuNdErClAp-

My eyes widen in shock as I begin to accept the one thing I have been trying to avoid... I call upon an old forsaken friend... I call Evil...  Like a swift wind he comes. He restores my strength and vigor. Takes away my compassion and my mercy. My heart hardens. I have died... only to be reborn again. I return a thousand times stronger... but as cold as a silver blade in the night...  You made me into this. Live with it...  -tHuNdErClAp-

      Oh God... I knew it was coming. One day... It was inevitable.  I need to know. My Heart is in shreds as I try to understand what is going on... Idah please tell me what have I done... I want to know. Seriously girl. I don't want you to be angry or sad. It breaks my heart to know I have done something wrong to you.  I dunno why, but you have always made me feel good about myself. I hope... No I know... that I have made you smile more then once before. But I had to tell you I felt a little... well jealous. its petty but I have feelings too... Its immature and I promise to get over it but I need time. Its going downhill right now. There is always ups and downs in life and I feel its going down for the two of us. Lets ride it out together girl... I will hold your hand if you are scared. I promise. I will be there for you no matter what.  Ridhwan Hardi- 9th August 2004  -tHuNdErClAp-

      So the time capsule of ACS (Barker) 2004 is laid beneath the clocktower. My very eyes witness this great and historical event. But another more grand event was about to be celebrated on this very day... On Six August. The day of reckoning. It was my Birthday...  6th August 2004, Hardi turns 17.  The minister was a nice guy. And I was crowned the sexiest person on earth... But the time capsule was an inspiring moment. It was nice to be an ACSian that day. I felt the pride in the voices in all my brothers and sisters from all five schools. It was awesome. And how nice it was buried on my birthday.  -tHuNdErClAp-

      Welcome ladies and gentlemen to another of Hardi's Polls. After the success of the Dumbass Awards we now present ACS (Barker) SEXIEST TEACHER AWARD. Male category. The nominees for the poll are as follow.  Mr MelvinSim Mr Tang Chee Kuan Mr William Ding Mr Chan Vee Bun Mr Glenn Wong Mr Ernest Chia Mr Alan Lim Mr Azmy Mr John Chao Mr Lee Hock Joo Mr Ng Eng Chin Mr Wong Swee Ming  This nominees then competed for the coveted title and through a general vote. Six were voted off. Those who made it are as follows.  Mr Azmy Mr Lee Hock Joo Mr Wong Swee Ming Mr Melvin Sim Mr William Ding Mr Chan Vee Bun  Lets get to know our contestants before we continue...  Mr Azmy...  Super-ridiculously-long-title... AG HEAD OF DEPARTMENT (PHYSICAL EDUCATION) / SPORTS SECRETARY. He is one of the renowned PE teachers in ACS (Barker). Known to be quite cool he is a well-liked individual though his choice of underwear is somewhat a downside... Ping thong for example. And also he is rumoured to like to wear bras... Why we wonder....  Next is Mr Lee Hock Joo...  This is another PE teacher. He looks like a small boy with his milo tee and his white shorts. Weird Weird... But his boyish looks might win the crowd...  Third is another PE teacher... Mr Wong Swee Ming.  Mr Wong is just a nice guy... Yep... Cause he got really long legs... Heh Heh Heh.  Fourth in line is Mr Melvin Sim of the Disipline Department.  Mr Melvin Sim is a colourful character. For certain actions we have noticed him do.  Fifth is Mr William Ding.  My goodnest. Mr William Ding is a huge contender for this title. After returning from McChicken, UpperSerangoonAvenue, Mr William Ding has been known to be a tad... soft? Haha. But still his rumoured alter-ego as Sasha the Dominatrix is questionable.  Sixth is Mr Chan Vee Bun.  His rear is why basically why he is here and also by his favourite line... "  COME Hiiiierrreee!!!!!  " But his volumptous bottom is really a view... haiz...  From these three we must cut another three from the list... And those who remain will go into our GrandChampionships. And... the three to move on are...  Mr Chan Vee Bum Mr Melvin Sim Mr "Action" Azmy  But only one can win and who will it be? The answer... tune in next week on ABAST Award...  -tHuNdErClAp-

      How? Haha. I think I am making good progress. Really good progress. She is one of the loveliest girls I have ever met. But her phone is now confiscated and the only way i contact her is by the old fashion way of writing letters. Not that I am complaining. I am after all... I really MISS HER LIKE CRAZY! lol. Her first letter was really touching and I am really honoured that I am a important part of her life. Though I constantly tell her that I should not burden her... You know girl... I will always be there for you if you needed me. Even if I am not there physically.  Wrote you a nice poem by the way. Hope you liked it.  (a little more about Idah)  She is lovely. One of the most nicest girls I have ever met. Sooo decent, a very rare find. She is indeed unique to me. I would not forget that. Her ever bubbly presence makes me so much more happier. When she cries my heartaches in pain that I am unable to do anything. haiz... Miss you like crazy girl.  -tHuNdErClaP-
