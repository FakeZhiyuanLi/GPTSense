						   Today, the curtains were installed at my new house. i had blinds for my room. Looks nice. Now i can block the light and also change its direction. The blinds are (starting from the top) silver, grey, blue, grey, silver. Cool right. My brother's is also blinds, except his is more bluish. My mum's one is roller blinds. They are thick cloth block al the light out. Cool. That's all that's exciting. Anyway, my bee sting is itching now. Stepped on the bee in my room two nights ago. That's all.  Frederick

						   Today, all the curtains were put up. jia Hui's looked the best. Mine are blinds. There is the hammock in the balcony too. very fun. House looks better now.  Si Kai was very cold today. so he turned off all the fans and he bacame very hot. It was strange how quiet the class became when the fans were off. When it was on again, everybody dtarted talking. Funny. English was slack to day. We had an early break and went for com studies. Kent Cheong rocks. The module rocks too. Adobe photoshop 7, actionscript for the newest flash version, Video studio 7, and a lame but fun powerpoint xp lesson. So we are dealing with all the newest and scond newest com programs. Very fun. Hope i can get the 3Ds max 6 cd too.   Third lang was ok. just changed the venue of our project from Luebeck to Dressden(is the spelling correct).  that's all for today.  Frederick

						   Rain again in the morning. No flag rasing,YAY. If not we would have to stand so long to listen to the NCC and St John speech. Lesson was ok. Com studies rock today. Did adobe photoshop 7.rocks. we repaired a torn picture and deleted some waves on the sea. very realistic. We made a man look younger by deleting his wrinkles and also giving him an extra eye on the forehead. Chu Ming made half the face look as if it had been poured acid. But my com's phootoshop had problems and could not be used. Too bad.   Then I had Badminton. we did some drills and I left at 4.45 as the Humanities Nite was 6.30. Me and Yee Juinn went to KAP for dinner with some other people. We changed our clothes there beforegoing back to the drama centre. The performance rock. Only 2 suck. The sec 1s one and the singing one. The sec 1s dunno how to act. The singing one was about those singers being called gays. With that acting, i really think they are gay. Jia Wei's one was the best. That one rocks. Very very funny. And the acting was very real. The Singapore Japan one was also very good.  After that, we went home. Enloong and Sam was chasing each other again.   That's all  Frederick
