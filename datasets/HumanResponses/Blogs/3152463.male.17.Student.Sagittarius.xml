      Well, hello everybody ! My first post here, so let's see how it goes. Please bear with me - and if you don't want to bear with me, then go and bear somewhere else; although please remember there are laws against such actions.  So, an entry to post here, eh ? I used to have a blog, you know. It was nice. Sort of like this, only plainer. And it didn't have my picture at the top of the page, which Mr Battrick, the creator of this small piece of the web, has kindly done. This is sort of a trial entry for me, so we'll see how it goes.  I'll tell you a little about my day, that shouldn't be too bad. I'll liven it up a little, hopefully you might find it vaguely interesting. I awoke to the sound of birdsong, which was nice, and the sun streaming through my curtains ... that's the poetic bit, you see, so this becomes almost like a novel. I've spent most of the day writing some French coursework, which is quite time consuming. I managed to spend half an hour looking for a quote, and failing to find it ultimately. Ah well, I could have done far less productive things, such as ... dunno, daydreaming ? Although that is undeniably fun.   And now I'm upto the stage in the workload where I'm writing about "Art Deco – it’s influence on transport – 1925-1939". Can you think of a topic that could be more exciting than that ?! Most likely. But I shall carry on, regardless of boredom level, until it's concluded in a manner that would make a soap-opera writer quake in their boots (at the thought of a conclusion ... as they don't have them ... soaps, that is, not the writers ... it just wouldn't do to have immortal soap writers, would it ?).   Right, I think I had better go back to writing about the Normandie, the Bremen, the Europe, and whatever else was floating in the 1930s.   Until our next meeting, au'voir !

      What have I done today ?  Well, considering the nice weather we've been having, I thought I'd go for a walk, which I did.  That was nice.  Birds singing and the like ... yes, it was good.  I didn't see any badgers unfortunately, but overall it was nice.  A longer, better post will be posted soon !

      Mustn't forget the good people at Accurist ... They do a great job of the speaking clock, the *most* expensive way of finding the time !   Speaking Clock - The Facts :   The BT Speaking Clock has also been known as TIM (the three-letter code, short for TIMe, that users dialled in the days of alphabetical dials !).    The BT Speaking Clock has been ticking 24-hours a day, seven days a week since 24th July 1936 – which is 67 years, more than 24,000 days, more than 586,000 hours or 35 million minutes !   Originally the accuracy of the BT Speaking Clock was one-tenth of a second, it is now correct to within five thousandths of a second !   There have only ever been three voices for the BT Speaking Clock, apart from a two week period in March 2003 when Lenny Henry did a special version of the Speaking Clock in aid of Comic Relief  :   -         A London telephonist, Jane Cain was the first voice in 1936 and lasted until 1963.   -         Miss Pat Simmons, a supervisor in a London telephone exchange became the second voice from 1963 until 1984.   -         The present voice, belongs to Brian Cobby (73) who was an assistant supervisor at Withdean exchange in Brighton. He became the first male voice at 11 am on 2nd April 1985. Brian Cobby, an actor by profession before he joined BT, was selected from 12 finalists in BT’s Golden Voice competition, on 5th December 1984.   Before Brian Cobby worked for BT, he recorded the “5-4-3-2-1… Thunderbirds are go!” for the theme tune to Gerry Anderson’s TV series !     Brian Cobby has received fan mail from ‘mature ladies’ who say they listen to him late at night when they can’t sleep !     The longest distance call to the Speaking Clock is from a factory in Hong Kong, which makes handsets for the VideoPlus VCR programming system. The in-built clock is set to British time, courtesy of BT's Speaking Clock service.    The timing of most television programmes is synchronised to the BT Speaking Clock as well, so when your local station goes over to ITN for the News at Ten, this is done "at the third stroke".     The world’s most famous clock, Big Ben, checks its time with the BT Speaking Clock and many major organisations have permanent feeds of the clock from BT into their private internal phone systems so employees can check the time without making an outside call.   The 1936 Speaking Clock was an of array of motors, glass discs, photocells and valves and took up the floorspace of a small room! The current Speaking Clock, with a built-in crystal oscillator and microprocessor logic control, the complete apparatus is made of solid-state microchips and occupies no more shelf space than a small suitcase does – and has no moving parts at all.     Describing the BT Speaking Clock as a National Institution is probably fair, since as a nation we seem to be remarkably keen on ringing up. Even in its first year, 1936, the service registered nearly 13 million calls and it was not a nationwide service then - that came six years later. Today we make around 100 million calls a year and that's a lot of watches being checked.   The original Speaking Clock message was recorded and replayed rather like the optical sound track of a film and the equipment represented the state of the art of current technology in those days. This lasted until 1963, when it was replaced by more modern recording technology, using a magnetic drum. It gave way to the present digital system in 1984 and this has no moving parts at all.  The unquestioned accuracy of the Speaking Clock has also led to the association of Accurist Watches, who since 1986 have sponsored the BT Speaking Clock announcements. With those 100 million calls a year, this may well be the most frequently heard advertising message of all time.    But what did people do before the speaking clock was invented if they wanted a time check? Simple: they rang the operator and asked her the time by the exchange clock on the wall, but this was not precise to the second, nor could the exchange always answer just when the customer wanted. The first genuine speaking clock machine was introduced in the USA in 1927, coming to Paris in 1933, The Hague in 1934 and Switzerland in 1935. But automatic time service (of a Heath-Robinson kind) had been available to telephone users in San Francisco since the late 19th century; by listening for to an observatory clock at least a minute and decoding clicks and single and double buzzes against some detailed instructions you could set a pocket watch-but it helped if you already knew more or less what the time was ! A proper speaking clock is far less trouble !   - from  urlLink  Telephones UK

      Hello ! ... I'm back !  A couple of days ago, a continental market arrived in my area, full of wonderful European foodstuffs :) !  Mmmm ...  I especially liked the Dutch chocolate waffles and the French fries dipped in garlic and parsley !  Today, however, I went to IKEA, and was enjoying my meal, when a women asked me if I'd mind taking part in a survey ... Of course, I said I wouldn't mind, as it wouldn't delay me for very long ... It was very interesting ... That's all that's really happened in the last few days, so I have nothing much else to write !

      Ooh, I'm back, and I'm probably here to annoy you again ! (If I annoy you, I really don't understand why you're bothering to read this, but ...) Anyway, on with the show :D !  I'm sitting here again (oh, how many hours is it possible for me to just sit ...) in boredom (as usual) and wondering what to write ...  Well, it's not so bad, is it ?  At least I'm making the effort to write something (unlike some people I can think of [cough, cough, cough] ) ... I know what I'm going to tell you !  I'll tell you about the evils of the popular high street trading post known as WH Smith.  Today, I walked casually in to my local (notice that word,  local ) branch, hoping to order a copy of a recently published book.  To my shock, horror and amazement, I was told that the book was unobtainable, due to the fact that  "it's not on our system"  ... I responded with a rant : "terrible service for a national chain !  Amazon is much better !  I can order the same item for their efficient online site (click  urlLink here  to go there [please support those good people as they do a great job !] ) and have it posted directly to me within 3 days !" ... As you can imagine, I left quietly ...  It makes me so angry ... There is no reason whatsoever for them to tell me that it's unobtainable !  If they didn't have monkeys working at the desk ... none of this would have happened !  The day has by no means been wasted, though !  I managed to find great value for money in the form of 30 CD-Rs for an amazingly well spent £10 ! (the package also included a free CD pen !)  So, I'm happy !

      In an effort to find something worthy of writing about, I have ended up amusing myself by finding definitions  (in the Oxford English Dictionary)  of words that seem to me to be undefinable ... Not much luck yet ... "  art  (noun) - production of something beautiful; skill or ability; paintings or sculptures etc.; (pl.) subjects other than sciences, requiring sensitive understanding rather than use of measurement " ... Seems reasonable to me.

      So, another day, and another way of saying hello to the world !  I'm back home now (you didn't know that I'd ever left, of course) , sitting at my desk, wondering what to tell you ... Well, as I write this, I can hear the faint sound of badgers singing as they roam in a nearby field (for more information,  urlLink click here  and  urlLink here  ... but that's for another time.  Anyway, where was I ?  Ah, yes, I was telling you what I'm doing ...   I think this explains everything quite well :       Anyway, I'm feeling quite happy, surfing the net and making a few adjustments to a couple of my websites, so overall, it's been quite a good day (nothing unusual happened [click  urlLink here  for details of what could have easily happened !]  Oooh, by the way, there is a really funny Flash animation  urlLink here , so have a look at that as well !  I hope tomorrow will be as happy as today has been !

      You may have been led to believe - due to the fact that I haven't posted for several days - that I was no longer posting.  Sadly for you, I have just been buying time for which to compose a newer, longer post for all 2 of you to read !  The site statistics are promising, so I'm expecting quite a number of avid readers this time around.  Yesterday was interesting, mainly due to the fact that I purchased a number of interesting items during my shopping trip.  First of all, it was a Peter Kay Live DVD : 'Bolton Albert Halls', which I would highly recommend to any fan of his excellent comedy series, 'Phoenix Nights'.   Quotes : "Don't pull that ... It's for warden !" ...  followed by  "Sorry, It's me grandson ... He thought it were t'big light".   The second purchase was a very good guide to Photoshop 7, 'Photoshop 7.0 A - Z'.  It's a great book, with a really good cover price of £17.99, the average Photoshop book being £30 !  It explains how to do absolutely everything under the sun, and is illustrated with full-colour screenshots throughout.  The Appendices are also incredible, with a comparison chart, plugin descriptions and recommended websites.  Well worth buying !  The final purchase of the day was the stunningly funny French film 'Les Visiteurs', which if you haven't seen it, is about a French knight and his servant who get transported to the 20th Century ... Monty Python meets Blackadder, definately.   Quote : "Look Sire, a Moor !"  They procede to smash up a car.

      Here we go ... I awoke this morning at 7 AM.  Yes, I know it's early, but that's the way it is.  I spent the day, as usual, boring myself half to death with inconsequential thoughts and ideas.  I had lunch at 1:30 PM (extremely late, but not my fault) - undoubtedly featuring sandwiches - which delighted my taste-buds no end ... Well, maybe  not , but  still  ...  The afternoon was spent puzzling over more inconsequential thoughts and ideas which would seem boring to an amoeba, with pen at hand.  It's amazing how uninteresting things can appear when you put your mind to it, you know.  I have discovered this through years of practice, preparation, and very long sessions of boredum, without any means of escape, or 'way out'.  I then returned to my 'place-of-dwelling' and sat down.  If any of the amphibiology above seemed somewhat thought-provoking, I advocate that you seek medical attention instantaneously, if not sooner.

      Yesterday was throughly enjoyable, what with  The Calculus Affair  being shown on  Five , and of course, Eurovision.  Surprisingly, we didn't win; as every country under the sun donated 12 whole points to their neighbour. Cyprus voted for Greece, for example.  Another example of this highly unfair policy of voting for friends (this time Belarus is at it) :   Belarus Announcer : And 1 point to the UK ! Terry Wogan : Finally ! ... Belarus (later) : Finally, 12 points go to ... Terry Wogan : It  can't  be Russia ? Belarus : RUSSIA ! Terry Wogan : I've been doing this for too many years ...   France's entry was of note; featuring a bald woman on stilts and a smaller man singing *at* her ... Terry Wogan compared it to  The Little Prince .  The Netherlands entered  Reunion , consisting of two singers, one *playing* (I doubt) the guitar, the other singing - in a very awkward high pitched voice - about something which I have now luckily forgotten.  By the way, the Ukraine won, with another sloppy act worthy of absolutely nothing.  But,  The Calculus Affair  was very enjoyable ...

Plus a 'Buddist-clipart' sodden 'thank you' note ... with a PS - 'Please leave positive feedback' (Hmmm ... [But only if I leave them feedback, will they provide me with positive words of praise, they say] )

      Hey nonny no !  I felt like writing an entry tonight ... you know, you get inspired, or something to that effect. Well, I was inspired a couple of Saturdays ago, when I went to an exhibition of Quentin Blake's work at the Harris Museum, in Preston.        Yes, that's the guy ! The work was really incredible - including some full-page ink and watercolour illustrations for 'The Witches', and cover art to 'The BFG'. There was also huge pieces for picture books he had done, which were stunning to look at. A fantastic trip, I'd say, and highly recommend going, if you can. It's on at the Harris Museum and Art Gallery, Market Square, Preston PR1 2PP (I have the exhibition poster on the wall in front of me). It's free admission, and you can purchase a Magic Pencil from the gift shop, which draws in four different colours ! And yes, I have one. It's so much fun, I've spent countless lessons doodling with it.  I'm not sure what else I can write about now ... Oh ! Congratulations to Oliver for getting 'Tintin and Alph-Art' from eBay - that edition is incredibly rare now, enchanced by the fact that the new edition was released yesterday.   And I believe I shall leave it there. Stay safe, everyone, and remember : feeding Stilton to rottweilers by hand may seem like a good idea, but it's not as easy as it looks, if you are fond of your limbs. Au'voir !

      eBay ...  what  a topic to talk about !  There's nothing I like better than bidding on eBay, apart from any other alternative ... Yes, eBay is usually a  last  resort.  I did however, manage to pick up a nice copy of  Tintin and Alph-Art  yesterday, which seems to have influenced my decision to write a post about this incredibly interesting subject.  Highly unlikely, I know, but I hope you enjoy this short delve into the world of eBay.  I'm going to explore the fascinating field of eBay IDs.  Before any individual can join the eBay community, he / she has to choose a nickname to be identified by within eBay.  This is referred to as an eBay ID.  Many IDs are unpronounceable, but many display humourous or entertaining qualities, such as mine, which I think sums up my 'end of auction' feelings; 'franticdilemma'.  Call it what you will ;) .  Richard suggested 'Outbid_me_and_i'll_kill_you_in_your_bed_as_you_sleep', which I also think is very appropriate.  At least now I can relax, safe in the knowledge that the good book is finally on its way ...

      To start with, I'd like to congratulate Mr. Wainman on his first post !  Then, I'll tell you a bit about my day ...  I started this morning by watching the Tintin movie;  Tintin and the Lake of Sharks , which, although nothing like Hergé's books, was quite enjoyable.  What interested me about the television version is that the title sequence differs from the video version ... yes, I know I live a sad life :( .  You can't blame me though, as I have been under the weather for several days.  If you find that reasonably interesting, I suggest you wait for another post ...

      Hello again !  I am sorry to have been away for so long.  Thank you to Richard for holding the fort, so to speak, while I have been away.  I have, in fact, been to Walt Disney World in Florida, which was very enjoyable.  My favourite of the four Disney parks is EPCOT, the main feature of which is pictured below.       A very impressive site at the front of the EPCOT Center, indeed.  There is actually a ride inside it -  Spaceship Earth  - which is a history of mankind, featuring animatronics and 'time-travelling' vechicles ... Don't ask.  Another great part of EPCOT is  Test Track  : a fast-paced ride in which the riders are supposed to be crash dummies for car testing.  The tests are performed indoors, but the highlight of the trip is a 'practice run' at 80 mph around the outside of the building !  That is a truly incredible experience !  Highly recommended.         Also in EPCOT's Future World is  The Land  - an example of how to grow crops without soil etc,  Mission : SPACE  - a disappointing simulation ride of space flight,  Universe of Energy  - an animatronic show about the creation of energy,  Imagination !  - an area about 'your imagination', featuring Dr. Nigel Channing  (Eric Idle) , a strange character called 'Figment', and the cast of 'Honey I Shrunk The Kids',  Wonders of Life  - about the body,  Innoventions (East & West)  - a world of exciting interactive experiences - hosted by 'Tom Morrow 2.0' and  The Living Seas  - seemed a bit of a disappointment ... About fish.  The other half of EPCOT is called  World Showcase  - a journey around the world, featuring pavilions of Mexico, Norway, China, Germany, Italy, The USA, Japan, Morocco, France, The United Kingdom and Canada (all include people of these nations, and local food etc.)  There are of course three other parks in Walt Disney World, but EPCOT is my favourite, so I'll leave it at that.  I will however mention a extremely enjoyable ride at the Animal Kingdom, called  Primeval Whirl .  It's basically a roller coaster, but with not as many turns as the usual kind.  The difference is that the carriages spin around as they go down and over bumps.  It is a great ride, and I would recommend trying to get on it twice in one day, as it's over quite quickly.  The queues don't tend to be that long though, so it's not too long a wait.  If you're in need of music, DVDs, videos, games, books, a cinema etc. while you're staying in Disney, there's a  Virgin Megastore  at Downtown Disney, along with a cinema, a guitar shop, night clubs, restaurants etc.  Sadly, I found no trace of Tintin in Florida.

      Ladies and gentlemen, we have a problem.  We have lost our Oliver.  No sign has been seen of said Oliver for a number of days now, and quite frankly, we are beginning to worry. We wish Oliver a speedy return from wherever he is, and hope that he gets back to blogging, MSNing, drawing, and all the Olivery things we know and love.   Please come back, we need you !

      Last weekend (a week ago today), I endured a rather long train journey to visit London; the reason being that I was going to see the new Tintin exhibition,  The Adventures of Tintin At Sea.&nbsp;  I managed to acquire all the leaflets, guides, and booklets regarding the exhibition that you can possibly imagine.&nbsp; On the way to London Paddington, I read  The Pocket Essential Hitchhiker's Guide , which is the best source of information about the production of The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy that I found at the time of writing.  &nbsp;  Anyway, upon arrival in London (or Lon Don as it is referred to by Tubbs in that rather obscure television and radio series  The League of Gentlemen ), I made for Covent Garden, and the Tintin Shop which is located at 34 , Floral Street.&nbsp;&nbsp;Below is photographic&nbsp;evidence&nbsp;of how that marvellous establishment looked on Saturday, 10th July.  &nbsp;         I was rather pleased with my purchases of that trip, which included two T shirts, several books and a keyring featuring the logo from the Tintin musical,  Tintin Et Le Temple Du Soleil .&nbsp; On my way back to my hotel, I stumbled upon a Swatch shop in Covent Garden, and promptly purchased a Tintin watch.&nbsp; Where I'm from, that's what we call a very eventful day.&nbsp; The following morning - on my way to the exhibition&nbsp;- I discovered a wonder of London Public Transport :  The Docklands Light Railway .&nbsp; For the unfortunate souls amongst you who have not had a ride on this 'highway in the sky' - to coin a phrase, I will try to explain this jewel in London's crown.&nbsp; Basically, The Docklands Light Railway is&nbsp;a monorail system, very much in the style of the Underground, except of course that it's two storeys above the ground, and goodness knows how many above the 'underground'.&nbsp; I know - that sentence explains absolutely nothing, and you're probably thinking that its sole purpose is to pad out this otherwise dry, dull text.&nbsp; If you think that, then you're reminding me of Marvin (the paranoid android of 'the guide'), and I suggest you stop reading as soon as possible.&nbsp; Anyway, back to the Docklands Light Railway.&nbsp; This incredible ride 'zooms' past tower blocks, until it finally comes to ground level to cross the river like an underground train.&nbsp; The 'Cutty Sark (for Maritime Greenwich) is the station needed to access the National Maritime Museum , where the exhibition is located.&nbsp; I found an Ottakar's Bookshop right outside the station, and -&nbsp;you should have&nbsp;guessed&nbsp;- I bought three Tintin postcards.   &nbsp;

      I've been away for another four weeks ?!  So, what's new ?  Well ... Yesterday, I decided that I would explore the shopping scene and I ended up buying a rather fine dip pen from an art shop :       It works incredibly well, uses an 'italic 3' nib and I'm quite proud of my first drawing with it (on tracing paper and coloured using Photoshop) :       More purchases were purchased during yesterday's travels : several books ('The Encyclopaedia of Cult Children's TV', 'The Pocket Essential Laurel & Hardy', a previously 'unknown-to-me' translation of 'The Little Prince', with colour illustrations and 'It Must Be True - A Collection of newspaper bloopers, misprints etc.') and also a bottle of black Quink ink for my dip pen !  Today, I've been sitting here listening to Green Day's version of 'I Fought The Law' and 'Camp Grenada' ...
