      i had a dream about shooting last night...the models were nude, and the majority of the shots were in deep shadows with few highlights. has anyone seen nude photos like these? I couldn't figure out if I've seen something like this before or if it was just something I really want to work with. I need a camera...i need a model....i need a studio...man times like this I miss how convenient being in school was..

       urlLink ModernBook   this bookstore explains designers so perfectly. You walk in, and theres a few tables with books lined up perfectly on each. all the same height, no more than one per pile, perfect grids, then you pan to the walls and you see similar griding of magazines, hanging on the wall. deeper in the 'gallery' you find bookshelves that are shaped like cubbies, fitting one book laying down in each one. all of the furniture is light wood, and it's just perfectly grided and simple. completely modern, made especially for designers who need simplicity and structure to their lives.  the only thing I didn't like is wanting to buy a book but not wanting to ruin the set up. yet i felt like I was supposed to know how the place worked and couldn't ask if they had extras so we could buy, etc. but i was able to spend many minutes on my half hour lunch in there just absorbing the different book titles because well,  i want them all. ;)

      I can't promise that I won't end up venting here, but I'll try to keep the rants to a minimum unless they have to do with design/art. Just lookin for a place to express my thoughts instead of holding them in and being ashamed of my opinions on art. That is what art is for after all right? Expressing one's feelings and emotions? or is it?...

      is this what life is supposed to be like? just go to work and then maybe hang out with friends after work but not really doing anything productive? I feel like i'm so unfulfilled cuz i've been in such a dry spell from design. I crave it all day long every day especially when I meet new designers or get to talk about it for one split second, ideas flow through my head at all hours of the day, but when I find time to sit down in front of my g5 I draw a blank.  maybe it's the time constraint of my 'bed time' so i can get up for work the next day. that keeps me thinking I need to cut the designs short. I wish I just had a day off so I could really sit down and design..

      Just when I think my design 'career' is going to be over because I was so desperate for a job that I took a receptionist gig, I've been getting calls about freelance jobs! Yay! I hope more come from these small time contracts. at least its somethin rite?? keeps my creativity flowing a bit more than answering a phone, talking online and writing blogs all day..

      yeah, I thought I was okay with the fact that i'm working this receptionist job and doing design for them sometimes when they need it, but today I realized how much they don't appreciate the crisp attractive designs I'm putting out for them. no, I take that back... Two agents do, they keep coming back for more and are more and more excited each time, but the ones at the other office, for whatever reason, come to me cuz they hear good things and then go behind my back asking the other receptionist with no design skills to do it over again, or make any changes on my designs..  Why why do people insist on liking gross designs? I get sick at the sight of poor designs, and boy are her flyers poorly designed...  May sound mean but just proves that I'm in it for real design ..or something... right? hehe

      an email i received from my ex-boss:  Never think for a moment that any slight was intended or I failed to remember who the "design dork" is, or I've forgotten about what a sweet person you are and what you meant to us here, or I just didn't have the time for you to respond. Ok maybe the last one was true and your email fell into the black hole with the other 14,600 emails I've saved somewhere but just can't delete, but it doesn't mean the other things are true. They aren't   If it still matters for you to hear it, you are truly missed too and I do think about you from time to time. You definitely made/left your mark here at Bayside and with me personally. You're a rare breed- hard worker that is good at what she does without attitude and who cares about what she does; sensitive, yet strong; opinionated yet willing to listen and learn.    As far as Mindy Smith goes, over 30 years in the business I've never been prouder of an involvement from the very start of an artist's career and then watching and contributing to it's development into something big, than with Mindy Smith. I loved this record from the very first time I heard the first song and, like you said, have played it probably a hundred times since and told a thousand people about her. I have the ad we created together "A first release, an everlasting impression...sure to be critically acclaimed" up on my wall and have sent it to countless people to show them that I've believed in her from the start. The programs that I created to market her at Tower have been credited with being the spark that got her sales started, as well as the attention drawn to her which  ultimately helped to lead to her crossing into the mainstream.   Besides all the radio she's getting around the country, her video was added to VH1 last week and sales are out of control. She'll probably (eventually) go "gold" and I still predict, as I did back in February, that she's going to win a Grammy.Couldn't have done it without you.
