      Nickkie said he feels guilty knowing that I am anguished by the whole thing so I am now psyching myself to sound happy if ever we see each other.  It's not going to be easy but I will try...  really hard.  Anything for his happiness... his peace of mind.  I love him that much...

      (To Nickkie)  I know you are busy and it seems that setting another time for us to talk would be impossible for the next couple of weeks.  I understand that there are so many things happening in your life right now and in as much as I would like to be a part of it, circumstances do not allow it.  You wished that I am not mad at you.  Your wish is granted.  I am not mad at you.  I can never be mad at you.  The love that I have for you will always purify anger in my heart.  If I could only wish for that day when I would greatly hate you, then letting you go would be so much easier.    I cannot hate you for all these but I am not going to deny the fact that you have deeply hurt me.  I know, at the very least, that by virtue of our friendship, you would never ever deliberately hurt me.  Moreso, because you said you truly love me.  But then, you are the only person who can intensely hurt me.  You have that much power over me because I have warranted you with great control over my heart.  I love you that much.  Time and time again, I have asked myself why I allow myself to be in this misery.  I questioned myself for allowing myself to be a part of  your life again.  You were perfectly fine before I came back to your life.  I asked why I still persevere when you’ve already given up on us.  Despite the intelligence that other people admire in me, I have flaunted so much foolishness.  I only have one answer.  My mind is filled with a lot of questions with insensible answers... and my heart?  Abundant with love but is drowned in pain.  I long for you.    Greatly tempted as I am to just tell you that I will swallow everything just to have you back, I am not sure if that would do you any good.  My heart tells me that I can accept everything that it may take just to have you again.  Without a choice, I am in battle, confronted by my adversaries in your life – school, work and singing.  Just let me take you through all that:  School and work.  No question.  I will always give way.  I can never question why you can’t see me because of school and work.  I am proud of how responsible you have become in these aspects.    You know that I will support you and extend any form of help that I can give you just to make you succeed and excel in these endeavors.  Singing.  I am pleased to see that you are enjoying singing in the choir and in the chorale.  I am even more pleased because it has become your channel to express yourself, develop friendships and ultimately serve the Lord.    I know that there should be no competition between me and your priorities.  To have a balanced life, you need all that.  But since you felt that you cannott handle all that if I am in your life, you chose to let go of me despite your claim for great love for me.    Your text message struck me tonight.   I love singing and it is one of my priorities right now .  Fair enough.  It is logical and fit to prioritize what we love, right?    I never asked you to let go of anything that is important to you.  No matter how painful it is for me to see you torn between me and something else when we were together, I would try to find a way to understand.  I was consoled with your words of assurance that you love me.  But now, no matter how many times you tell me how much you love me, I will still be letting you go thinking that I was not deeply loved and cared for.  After all, I was the one who was voted out from your life.  I just cannot reconcile the fact that you are letting me go when you said that I am the best thing that has ever happened in your life.    I am saying goodbye.  It was a long and hard decision, one that I am taking with a grain of salt.  But in time, it will be for the best.    I have no regrets.  Loving you has given me so much inspiration and happiness.  Loving you has humbled me.  Loving you has given me life.  With that, I still want to thank you.  I pray that in reclaiming myself, I could still look back and smile at the memories that we made together.  As I take my steps away from you, I will bring with me my prayers for your well-being.    We have been very good friends through the years.  My greatest consolation is that I know that we will remain good friends until the end of our days but I need to do this for now.  I just need some time to nurse my heart.  Just the same, know that I will always be here for you as a friend.  Should you be in dire need, you know how and where to find me.  Always take care.  Good luck.  God bless.

      Just a Short Story for All!   A young and successful executive was traveling down a neighborhood street, going a bit too fast in his new Jaguar. He was watching for kids darting out from between parked cars and slowed down when he  thought he saw something.   As his car passed, no children appeared. Instead, a brick smashed into the Jag's side door! He slammed on the brakes and drove the Jag back to the spot where the brick had been thrown. The angry driver then jumped out of the car, grabbed the nearest kid and pushed him up against a parked car shouting, "What was that all about and who are you? Just what the  heck are you doing?  That's a new car and that brick you threw is going to cost a lot of money. Why did you do it?"  The young boy was apologetic. "Please, mister... please, I'm sorry... I didn't know what else to do," He pleaded. "I threw the brick because no one else would stop..."    With tears dripping down his  face and off his chin, the youth pointed to a spot just around a parked car.  "It's my brother," he said. "He rolled off the curb  and fell out of his wheelchair and I can't lift him up."    Now sobbing, th e boy asked the stunned executive, "Would you please help me get him back into his wheelchair? He's hurt and he's too heavy for me."   Moved beyond words, the driver tried to swallow the rapidly swelling lump in his throat. He hurriedly lifted the handicapped boy back into the  wheelchair, then took out his fancy handkerchief and dabbed at the fresh  scrapes and cuts. A quick look told him everything was going to be okay.   "Thank you and may God bless you," the grateful child told the stranger. Too shook up for words, the man simply watched the boy push his wheelchair-bound brother down the sidewalk toward their home.    It was a long, slow walk back to the Jaguar. The damage was very  noticeable, but the driver never bothered to repair the dented side door. He kept the dent there to remind him of this message "Don't go through life so fast that someone has to throw a brick at you to get your attention!"  God whispers in our souls and speaks to o ur hearts. Sometimes when we don't have time to listen, He has to throw a brick at us.  It's our choice.

      They say love makes you do things that you never imagined you're capable of doing...  I guess this has been my indicator since the first time I fell in love but it hits me more now because my love for someone has been rekindled and has become stronger than ever.  I woke up one day realizing that I still love this person.  I wanted him back and i've resolved to make it work this time but circumstances don't seem to agree with my yearning.  He still loves me but he has other priorities.  After our break-up years ago, I never imagined being with him ever again.  Moreso, ask him back.  But now, living each day without him has become an arduous endeavor.  I would lay awake in bed all night thinking about him.  I would pour my heart out to friends so that I'll be consoled when in my heart I know that the only person who can console me is the one I truly love and care about.  My concentration at work is greatly disturbed.  My heart breaks into pieces when I read his love messages stored in my phone.  I've totally lost my composure.    What do I do now?  My final decision is to still persevere.  Afterall, he's dejected without me and wants to make it work, too.  He just worries about hurting me in the process.  I don't really care for it hurts me more living my life without him.    I love him that much.

      We dont know yet when Love is real Fall in and out will be a great deal You ask me if we can be more than friends Little by little I told you  That we are too young  And that stupid  Feeling you must kill.  My dreams are shining from above And at the summit of success I must arrive You ask me if we could share  The same dreams of love But I told you I'm too busy to fall in love.  Problems and trials come to my way Depressions slowly captured my being  You ask me if you could mend my broken heart But I told you that i'm too busy to fall in love.  Too many opportunities have been wasted Too passionate feeling has failed Two hearts have been severely wounded Two real love have tirely waited.  Suddenly, I felt that i love you  From the day we first met And to tell you about it i honestly hesitate I ask if your love hasn't already faded But you told me that falling in love  With me is now too late!

      Funny how the sweetest puzzle completing my life    can inflict so much pain in my heart.   Funny how the one who creates a beautiful sound in my life    can say the most heartbreaking words. Funny how my heart can be very generous    with the person who gives none. Funny how all these create so much bliss    and make my heart throb at the same time. Funny???   Not!

      After our goodbyes, I thought my life would be better without a word from you, without a glimpse of you.  But then, I have realized the immeasurable difficulty of nursing a wounded heart that seeks the subject of pain.    So here I am, watching along the sidelines of your life, simply assuming the role of a good friend.  And as promised, I will always be here for you, no matter what it takes.  I will cheer with you whenever you rejoice; weep with and encourage you whenever you fail.  I will be here.  I will continue loving you.  I will wait for you until you are ready to love me again.

       (Got this via email several times already.  Now it means more than it used to...)   Recently, I overheard a Mother and daughter in their last moments together at a regional airport. They had announced her departure and standing near the security gate, they hugged and she said, "I love  you. I wish you enough."  She in turn said, "Mom, our life together has been more than enough.  Your love is all I ever needed. I wish you enough, too, Mom."   They kissed and she left.  She walked over toward the window where I was seated.  Standing there, I could see she wanted and needed to cry. I tried not to intrude on her privacy, but she welcomed me in by asking, "Did you ever say good-bye to someone knowing it would be forever?"  "Yes, I have," I replied.  "Forgive me for asking, but why is this a forever good-bye?" I asked.  "I am old and she lives much too far away. I have challenges ahead and the reality is, the next trip back will be for my funeral," she said.  "When you were saying good-bye I heard you say, "I wish you enough." May I ask what that means?"   She began to smile. "That's a wish that has been handed down from other generations. My parents used to say it to everyone."   She paused for a moment and looked up as if trying to remember it in detail, she smiled even more.   "When we said 'I wish you enough,' we were wanting the other person to have a life filled with just enough good things to sustain them," she continued.    Then, turning toward me, she shared the following as if she were reciting it from memory.   I wish you enough sun to keep your attitude bright. I wish you enough rain to appreciate the sun more. I wish you enough happiness to keep your spirit alive. I wish you enough pain so that the smallest joys in life appear much bigger.  I wish you enough gain to satisfy your wanting. I wish you enough loss to appreciate all that you possess. I wish you enough hellos to get you through the final good-bye."   She then began to sob and walked away.  My friends and loved ones, I wish you ENOUGH!!!  They say "It takes a minute to find a special person, an hour to appreciate them, a day to love them, but then an entire life to forget them".

      After a stormy childhood and adolescence, for which I have lived through, I told myself that there would be no disturbances that I won't be able to endure.  I would always say:  "Lord, there is nothing today that You and I can't handle".  I am in terrible pain right now but I know that this, too, shall pass.  I just wish that the Lord would show me how and when - really soon, I hope.

      I've learned that you cannot make someone love you.  All you can do is be someone who can be loved.  The rest is up to them.   I've learned that no matter how much I care,  some people just don't care back.   I've learned that it takes years to build up trust, and only seconds to destroy it.   I've learned that it's not what you have in your life  but who you have in your life that counts.   I've learned that you can do something in an instant  that will give you heartache for life.   I've learned that it's taking me a long time  to become the person I want to be.   I've learned that you should always leave loved ones  with loving words. It may be the last time you see them.   I've learned that you can keep going long after  you think you can't.  I've learned that we are responsible for what we do,  no matter how we feel.   I've learned that either you control your attitude  or it controls you.   I've learned that learning to forgive takes practice.   I've learned that there are people who love you dearly,  but just don't know how to show it.  I've learned that just because someone doesn't love you  the way you want them to doesn't mean  they don't love you with all they have.   I've learned that it isn't always enough to be forgiven by others.  Sometimes you have to learn to forgive yourself   I've learned that no matter how bad your heart is broken  the world doesn't stop for your grief.

       What is REAL?  Does it mean having things that buzz inside you and a stick-out handle?    Real isn't how you are made.  It's a thing that happens to you.  When a child loves you for a long, long time, not just to play with him, but REALLY loves you, then you become REAL.  It doesn't happen all at once.  You become.  It takes a long time.  Generally, by the time you are REAL, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby.  But these things don't matter at all, because once you are REAL you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand.   Well, we become real to the degree that we dare to love and be loved in return.  Being real is not about being externally beautiful.  It is about being hurt, but never giving up LOVE.  We are never diminished  nor do we lose when we love.  Yes, even when the love that we give is not appreciated, recognized and reciprocated.   So, is loving worth the pain?  I'd say yes for that's how I HAVE BECOME REAL.

      I pray that this will bless you as it blessed me.  Hello God, I called tonight To talk a little while I need a friend who'll listen To my anxiety and trial. You see, I can't quite make it Through a day just on my own... I need your love to guide me, So I'll never feel alone. I want to ask you please to keep My family safe and sound. Come and fill their lives with confidence For whatever fate they're bound. Give me faith, dear God, to face Each hour throughout the day, And not to worry over things I can't change in any way. I thank you God for being home And listening to my call, For giving me such good advice When I stumble and fall. Your number, God, is the only one That answers every time. I never get a busy signal, Never had to pay a dime. So thank you, God, for listening To my troubles and my sorrow. Good night, God, I love You too, And I'll call again tomorrow!

      From the very beginning, the girl's family objected strongly on her dating this guy, saying that it has got to do with family background, and that the girl will have to suffer for the rest of her life if she were to be with him.  Due to family's pressure, the couple quarrelled very often. Though the girl loved the guy deeply, she always asked him: "How deep is your love for me?"  As the guy is not good with his words, this often caused the girl to be very upset. With that and the family's pressure, the gal often vents her anger on him. As for him...he only endured it in silence.  After a couple of years, the guy finally graduated and decided to further his studies overseas. Before leaving, he proposed to the gal: "I'm not very good with words. But all I know is that I love you. If you allow me, I will take care of you for the rest of my life. As for your family, I'll try my best to  talk them round. Will you marry me?"  The girl agreed, and with the guy's determination the family finally gave in and agreed to let them get married. So before he left, they got engaged.  The gal went out to the working society, whereas the guy was overseas, continuing his studies. They sent their love through emails and phone calls. Though it was hard, but both never thought of giving up.  One day, while the gal was on her way to work, she was knocked down by a car that lost control. When she woke up, she saw her parents beside her bed. She realized that she was badly injured. Seeing her mum cry, she wanted to comfort her. But she realized that all that could come out of her mouth was just a sigh. she had lost her voice....  The doctor says that the impact on her brain has caused her to lose her voice. Listening to her parents' comfort, but with nothing coming out from her, she broke down. During the stay in the hospital, besides silent cry...it's still just silent cry that accompanied her. Upon reaching home,  everything  seems to be the same. Except for the ringing tone of the phone which pierced into her heart every time it rang. She does not wish to let the guy know and, not wanting to be a burden to him, she wrote a letter to him saying that she does not wish to wait any longer.  With that, she sent the ring back to him. In return, the guy sent countless replies and  phone calls.. all the gal could do besides crying is still crying...The parents decided to move away, hoping that she could eventually forget everything and be happy. With a new environment, the gal learnt sign language and started a new life.  Telling herself everyday that she must forget the guy. One day, her friend came and told her that he's back. She asked her friend not to let him know what happened to her. Since then, there wasn't anymore news of him.  A year has passed and her friend came with an envelope, containing an invitation card for the guy's wedding. The gal was shattered!  When she opened the letter, she saw her name on it instead. When she was about to ask her friend what was going on, she saw the guy standing in front of her....  He used sign language to tell her, "I've spent a year to learn sign language. Just to let you know that I've not forgotten our promise. Let me have the chance to be your voice. I Love You."  With that, he slipped the ring back into her finger. The gal finally smiled......  * Treat every relationship as if it's the last one, then you'll know how to give.  * Treat every moment as if it's the last day, then you'll know how to treasure.  * Treasure what you have right now, or else you may regret one day...  -- Sent by Mike Go, "A Sweet Love Story" (orig. subj.)
